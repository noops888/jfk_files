Jerry Lynn Davis, the FBI apparently

He said the FBi invoked "executive

Hetter, who said his SAO clients may

have been unwitting pawns of Godfrey

and the FBI, claimed he was unable to

get hold of F3i documents crucial to

Yakopce's defense.

"He just couldn't get our hands on

the stuff," he said. "And that in•

Rex Schrocder, head of the FBI office

here, said the FBI did cooperate during

the SAO trials, adding. "There's never

Schroeder said he hasn't reviewed

Other death threats followed.

Finally, on

Jan. 6.

1972. two shots were fired

through Boher's window. His triend, Paula Tharp

was wounded in the elbow.

As a result, police began to investigate the SAO.

But the fBI wasn't ready to blow Ciodfrey's cover.

Six months later. Goifrey aumitted

hadn't jammed. said the informant.

Godfrey had then taken the tell-tale pistol and

Hoover's jacket to FBI azent Christiansen. who hid

the evidence in his home until the SAO was exposed

later that year.

The final straw that broke the SAO was the wildcat

bombing of the Guild Theater on June 19. 1972. No

one was injured in the blast. but Rubien Brandon. a

detective on the San Diero police force. and Thorpe

Nolan of the cily autorney's etfice. were in the

audience apparently reviewing porno films for

possible obscenity violatiens.

After Brancon

and Police Chief Ray Hoobier

pressured the FBi to reveal its informer's identity.

Godfrey soon ascended the witness stand and nailed

Davis and other SA0 members.

Hoover was charged with shooting into Bohmer's

house and Godtrev's neighhor. William Francis

Yakopec, was ciied as the Guild Theater bomber.

According to Godfrey. Yakopec had long toved

The informer told how Yakopec met him at the

fence between their yards, still flushed from his

bombing exploit of the previous night.

Godfrey testified Yakopec described " ... the

sound, the blast, how the dust hung over the air at

the theater ... how he siood down at the end of the

block and listened to the blast. He then described to

me how he placed the bomb, what type of a comb he

used, and how he carried it down the alley and

planted it."

Frederick Hetter, Yakopec's attorney, believed

his client might have had grounds for

pleading

Godfrey's friendship with the unemployed

carpenter began in a gun shop. Soon after. Godirey

encouraged Yakopec to move next door to his El.

they discussed their mutual hate of pornography and

communism and explored their common loves -

guns and explosives.

It was Godfrey who sold Yakopec the explosives he

used to bomb the Guild Theater. Godirey said he

reported the transaction ic the FBI.

But Godirey maintained he advised his lieutenant

"he should bury them an' save them for after the

Communist takeover.

Conviction

Upheld In

Shooting

The state Supreme Court

has upheld the conviction of

George Mitcheil Hoover, 37,

a key figure in a series of

trials here in 1972 involving

alleged members of the

right-wing paramilitary Se-

cret Army Organization.

The Supreme Court ruling,

was

announced by the

office of Dist. Atty. Edwin L.

Miller, follows an Oct. 30,

1973, decision by the Fourth

District Court of Appeal.

reversing the conviction 'of

Hoover. The attorney gener-

al's office took the case to

the Supreme Court.

Hoover, formerly of:

Santee, was

sentenced to

five years to life in state

prison in January, 1973, fol-

sowing nis convicuion in su-

perior Couri on charges of

.assault with a deadly

weapon, firing into an occu-

pied dwelling and possession

of a billy club.

- Hogver appealed the con-

viction through Appellate

Defenders, Inc., questioning

the credibility of a key pro

secution witness. The wit-

ness was Howard Barry Go-

direy, a former San Diego

fireman who was a paid FBI

informant assigned to infil-

trate extremist groups..

Hoover contended the Su-

perior Court jury should

have been allowed to weigh

whether Godirey was work-

ing as a "double agent" with

both the FBI and the Secret

Army Organization, finally

deciding to testify for the

state to protect himself.

The charges against

Hoover stemmed from the

firing. of a bullet into the

nome of Peter Bohmer. then

a former assistant proiessor

at San Diego State Universi-

ty; on Jan. 6, 1972. The bullet

struck a friend of Bohmer,

Paula Tharp, 23, wounding

her in the arm. Bohmer re-

sided on. Muir Avenue In

Eday of Poway

I not interested in trying to form or lead any type of security force

for any right-wing extremist group. When asked by James K. Warner

of los Angeles (via Dennis Loso of Escondido) if he would do this,

Eddy stated that he would like to see the formation of a security

Force with teeth in it but does not consider himself to be enough

of a leader to do it himseli.

While declining to lead a Security Force, Eddy did say that

the only way to stop FBI infiltration of rightist groups would be

for one of the infiltrators to "wind up in the river" someday. Eddy

is positive that Ion Knight's San Diego unit of the Nazi Party has

& regular FBI infiltrator. The only three men of whom he is not aus

picious are Mickey Walefield, Ray. Wilson and Gerald Smith. Said lady,

"Those three men dropped out of the thing and so I figure they're okay

but you can bet that the fins is still in there

pushing".

Ioso said that the whereabouts of people like Barry Godirey

should be learned and they should be telephoned and intimidated.

Eddy said he thinks such intimidationg nould be a waste of time and

that people like Godirey should be killed. Mokey Hakeileld i san

Mercos went along with iddy's suggestion. Ron Eddy also mentioned

haring had an encounter with an FBI agent named Peterson in San Diego

:.

but did not elaborate.

Eddy firmly believes that any man who commits himself to one

organization in the far Right should not be involved mith others.

He says he would be very suspicious of anyone who is. He is also

somewhat suspicious of Tom knight. He says that Joe Brinker gave

Knight the name of a man interested in Nazism and two reeks later

the FBI interviewed the man. Also, Eddy wonders how knight saved

his lederal job in the face of his continued Nazi activities.. Eddy

feels that ary regular rightist extremist who stays on with the Nazi

Party now mut warrant heavy suspicion of being an FBI informant.

On Friday night, January 31, 1975 fon Eddy net fom letzger of

Fallbrook for the first time. letzger showed kày sone pictures and

slides of ver christian Crusade activities and the two seemed to bit

16 off pretty well. lietzger told Eady, wakefiela and loso of a visit.

he received at his home on January 17, 1975 from agents of the Internal

Revenue Service. He said the agents were nervous.

George Witchell Hoover

Here is one last bit of infomation. The New Christian Crusade

; people are very concerned about the imprisonment of George Hoover of

the Secret Army Organization.

At one of their banquets the NCC had

four unoccupied places set at the table which were in honor of four

men whom they hold to be absent heroes. These four men were Joe liccart:

George Hoover, Charles Lindbergh and a man named R. Miles.

Anyway, it has been learned that a man whom Iom Metzger knows

1s going to take a dossier of the Hoover case to some congressman

in Washington, D.C. who is part of a committee currently scheduled

to investigate the FBI. The dossier consists of newspaper clippings .

and other material pertaining to Hoover's activities in the SAO, his

arrest, conviction, appeal, etc. They are hoping to stir up a big

publicity stink to give the FBI a bad name due to Barry Godfrey's

activities and in so doing hope to effect an eventual release. of Hoover

from prison. By the way, the NCC people do not refer to Hoover by.

his correct name. For some reason they all call him Mickey Hoover.

That is about all for now. I hope this will be of some help

Vie Walton claims to have "put out the word" on Barry Godfrey

3 good year" before the arrests of members of tha secret Army Organization

i San Diego. Walton says he warned the SAC people to look out for

codfrey because he believed Godfrey to be half Jewish and, therefore,

intrustworthy. Walton says Godfrey was

too pre-occupied with firearms

ind explosives to be trusted. He admitted, however, that this seemed

¿o appeal to the SAO affiliates.

Vic Walton's Attituae

Vic Walton recently expressed his opinion of ceorge Mitchell Hoove

He said of Hoover,

"He is not the kind of man I would ever want to have

for an enemy because I don't think he would hesitate to do you in".

Walton continued, "However, Hoover seems like a real nice guy". "He

is very quiet and doesn't have much to say".

Walton is very anxious to have Ron Fady of Poway read Nature's

Eternal Relicion. Walton is really making a determined effort to push

this book. Its author, Ben Klassen, seems to think Hitler was the best

thing that ever happened to

the world and concludes his book by saying

that ultivately the White race will have to occupy all the usable lard

on Earth. That kind of tells you something without realiy saying it.

Walton says that Barry Godfrey once told him that his (alton's) teleph

was bugged.

That's it for now.

Irom his credit union and put up the equity in his house as collateral

to get Hoover out of jail. Eddy says that the only way to prevent people

from serving as informants for the FBI is to make examples of some of

them. Eddy believes that Hoover would murder Barry Godfrey if he could

find him and I think he is hoping something like that will happen.

When it becomes necessary for Godfrey to retum to San Diego, I cannot

over-emphasize the importance of maintaining heavy security for him.

Recently the nane of Barry Sodirey has been very muen on the mirie

down 1os Last issue the DOOR ran a siory about the activities of CREEP sp!

Donald segretti in San Diego. The story was imporiant enough for the ivew

York: Times (see below) to pick it up. In addition, it has been reprinted in the

Washington Post and a number of other places.

All week the DOCR has been getting phone calls from around the

country about our story. it has all been very rewarding — but also very

frustrating. Here we are sitting on a major news story and with the exception

of KGB — no San Diego news outlet has picked it up, or even called us to

= check the story out!!!

The DOOR will continue iis investigation into San Diego's Watergate

connections. And we will print whatever we find out! We hope that the

other news media in San Diego will get off their asses and do some work.

We will be glad to take them under our wing and give them a lead or two. Im

any event, you can read all about it right here in the DOOR.

We are reprinting the article from the New York Times so our readers can

enjoy it along with us and so the sceptics can see that somebody takes us:

EM - MI:

On 1/12/72 Informant was contacted by writer at

which time he furnished the following information.

Recently the Secret Army Organization prepared and •

distributed a special bulletin regarding PETER GEORGE BOHMER.

Response from Right Wing sympathizers to this bulletin has

been very encouraging and consequently, on 1/5/12, source was

given an assignment by JERRY LYN DAVIS, leader of the SAO,

to conduct a surveillance of the residance of 30M3R at 5155

Muir, Ocean Beach, for the purpose of obtaining additional

intelligence information, such as license plate numbers and

this information was to be used in the preparation of a future

intelligence bulletin of the sao.

In order to avoid going on this assignment alone,

source contacted GEORGE M. HOOVER, an associate of members

0f

the SAO, and requested that he accompany source.

Source and

HOOVER

arrived in the vicinity of 30m. R's residence at about

3:1,5 Pl that evenin, watched the mouse for a geriod of times

went so far as to plete mamase an inü sticker on the front

door of the house.

Informant aivised that at no time did he

see anyone enter see

ma, afterwards.

Source advised that prior to soing home he drove

by the house one last time.

He said that HooVER, who always.

•has one or more pistols with him at all times, made a staterent

about the house, exact nature unrecalled, pointed a pistol out

the-passenger window of the car, and fired two shots at the

that l'ortunately the pistol,

matle, jarden un thire shot or he feels certain port

an auto-

would have emptied the cop

It is noted that &

•that source

drives a bol marbler erican, dooled blue, whien wolla

generally rauch the description or

the shooting vehicle

as previously tarnished

to the police.

Source has explained

that he was reluctant to discuss this matter in its entirety

elous to one eate sis wester see time

wife was present aù the tire

and he dia not wish to upset her unnecessarily. He statea

that the

incident had come as a complete surprise to him,

and that he had ho intention or desire to take any action

at BOH.?'s residence other than to obtain whatever information

was

available in as discreet a manner as possible:

He said

he is estremely upset and dismayed at the turn of events

and would like to end his association with these individuals,

but, as before, could see no practical way of doing so at this

time.

It is noted that Informant has been repeatedly

cautioned, on previous occasions to avoid becoming directly

involved

an any activities which might result in personal

injury or death for any individual.

Saurce has wholeheartedly

agreed with this and has consistently furnished all information

in his possession regarding the possibility of such incidents

occuring.

"riter believes

that source

was totally unaware

that Hoovs? misnt shoot into the house before the incident

happened, mores

source has been advised to avoid all

future contact with gookar, as much as possible, and has

agreed that this would appear to be she

best course of action.

He advisea

that to the best of his knowlege, only he and

HOOVER are presently avare of the incident.

He said it is

his understanding the sun involved has been permanently dis-

posed of.

Source pointed out that the incident appears to

have cased HOOVIR to become quite "fires up" and to be ray

for a violent confrontation with the police if he should be

approached on the matter.

Source said he doubts HOOVER will

discuss the matter with

anyone else but cannot be sure of

this.

de said that 30015R has never been interviewed before

by law enforcerent and rould advised against such an inter-

•view in view oi his

SUBjECT: EXTREMIST INFORMANTS

EXTREMIST MATTERS

A recent article appearing in the Black Panther

Party (BPP) Cleaver Faction publication "Right On!" calls

for swift and unmerciful retaliation against current and

former extremist informants.

This article contains numerous

Intlammatory statements and may well signal the initiation

vell signal

of widespread retaliation against our informants.

Recently seized items 'from the Republic of New

Africa (RNA) included instructions to RNA members concerning

the indoctrination of those members suspected of being law

enforcement

informants.

These instructions basically involve

the completion of a personai questionnaire form and background

investigation.

Each agent should recognize the continuing possibility

of infiltrators within our extremist informant ranks.

There

have been attempts in the past to penetrate informant ranks,

and we can logically expect there will

be attempts in the

future in this regard. Therefore, all agents are reminded of •

• the importance of in-depth background investigation

and personal

knowledge of each informant, as well as the necessity for

careful verification and evaluation of information furnished

by extremist informants.

Each agent handling an extremist informant,

including extremist ghetto informants, should be thoroughly

alert to the absolute necessity for handling these informants

under the most secure conditions in order to eliminate the

possibility of these informants being exposed.

All agents

should also bring to the attention of their informants the

Republic of New Africa's methods of disclosing infiltrators

in order that our informants will be, forewarned.

However, before any implementation of this act

takes place, the United States Attorney's Office must con-

sult with the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice.

Should it become necessary that your informant testi-

fies in the ATFD case, the matter of this informant's safety

will be brought to the attention of the Department of Jus-

tice.

MI. KELLY advised that the information contained in

Ms. KELLY further suggested that the results of the

1/23/71 conference between ATFD and the U.S. Attorney's Office,

San Diego, be furnished to the Bureau in an LiM! for transmittal

to the Department.

MI. KELLY noted that the Department and the

ATFD in Washington, D. C., feel that the delivery of the

Luminating, grenade by informant

,to DAVIS would constitute a

violation under ATFD jurisdiction. It was pointed out to Mr.

KELLY that as set forth in referenced nitel, AUSA RISSO at

San Diego disagreed with that view and did not consider such

& set of facts a prosecutable violation.

The LiM should include information from ATFD or the

informant to the effect that the luminating grenade has or

has not been delivered by the informant to subject DavIs.

It would be well known that these individuals were known to

right wing groups.

Informani said the bulletin bore the name

of the "Prantom Militia"

, and was to be distributed on a

be distributed, although it was noted that one copy had already

been distributed to the front door or the Good Morning Teaspoon.

Informant subsequently determined that CLAY's reason for

removai of these bulletins was that one of the names indicated

source of information relative to this individial's activities.

It has been ascertained that at this time Ron Eddy of Poway

Is not interested in trying to form or lead any type of security force

for any right-wing extremist group. When asked by James K. Warner

Of Los Angeles (via Dennis Ioso of Escondido) if he would do this,

Eddy stated that he would like to see the formation of a security

Force with teeth in it but does not consider himself to be enough

of a leader to do it himself.

While declining to lead a Security Force, Eddy did say that

the only way to stop FBI infiltration of rightist groups would be

for one of the infiltrators to "wind up in the river" someday. Eddy

is positive that Tom Knight's San Diego unit of the Nazi Party has

picious are Mickey Wakefield, Ray Wilson and Gerald Smith. Said"bady,

"Those three men dropped out of the thing and so I figure they're okay

but you can bet that the fink is still in there pushing".

Ioso said that the whereabouts of people like Barry Godfrey

should be leamed and they should be telephoned and intimidated..

Eddy said he thinks such intimidations would be a waste of time and

that people like Godfrey should be killed. Mickey Wakefield of San

Marcos went along with iddy's suggestion. Ren Eddy also mentioned

having had an encounter with an FBI agent named Peterson in San Diego

but did not elaborate.

Eddy firmly believes

that any man who commits himself to one

organization in the Far Right should not be involved with others.

He says he would be very suspicious of anyone who is. He is also

somewhat suspicious of Tom knight. He says that Joe Brinker gave

Knight

the name of a man interested in Nazism and two weeks later

the FBI interviewed the man. Also, Eddy wonders how Knight

saved

his federal job in the face of his continued Nazi activities. Eddy

feels that ary regular rightist extremist who stays on with the Nazi

Party now mist warrant heavy suspicion of being an FBI informant.

On Friday night, January 31, 1975 Ron Eddy net

Tom Metzger of

rallbrook for the first time. Metzger showed judy some pictures and

slides of New Christian Crusade activities and the two seemed to hit.

George Mitchell Hoover

Here is one last bit of information. The New Christian Crusade

people are very concerned about the imprisonment of George Hoover of

the Secret Army Organization. At one of their banquets the NCC had

lour unoccupied places set at the table which were in honor of four

men whom they hold to be absent heroes. These four men were Joe hiccar

George Hoover, Charles Lindbergh and a man named R. Miles.

Anyway, it has been learned that a man whom fom Metzger knows

is going to take a dossier of the Hoover case to some congressman

In Washington, D.C. Who is part of a committee currently scheduled

to investigate the FBI. The dossier consists of newspaper clippings

and other material pertaining to Hoover's activities in the SAO, his

arrest, conviction, appeal, etc. They are hoping to stir up a big

publicity stink to give the FBI a bad name due to Barry Godfrey's

activities and in so doing hope to effect an eventual release of Hoovei

from

prison. by the way, the lice people do not refer to Hoover by.

his correct name. For some reason they all call him Mickey. Hoover.

That is about all for now. I hope this will be of some help

report of sahaman

December 9, 1974

SUBJECTS: NGG picke

order; thoughts on MCG; We

Dunds.

Here is sone more Information regarding the National Christian Grusade picket

which took place at the U.S.-läxico border in San Isidro on December 8, 1974. OF

the 16 men who took part in this uniformed picket, 10 were from the San Diego erea

and 6 were from los ingeles. It was mistakenly stated in yesterday's report on this

demonstration that 10 of the men were identified. In reality, 11 were fully identics:

1 partially identified, and 4 unidentified. The 4 unidertified were all from lo.

•Also, the members of this picket were divided into two contingents, los angeles

and San Diego. Commanding the San Diego group was Tom Ketzger of Fallbrook and in

charge of the Loi. men was Rick Norton. Also, Norton was in overall command of the

operation.

Two other things which were not mentioned in the earlier report are as follows.

First, forton told his men that if attacked, they should form into a back to back

square and "let her rip".

Also, after the conclusion of the denonstration, forton

conducted a very briet prayer.

As to my thoughts on the NCh, I feel that this group has the potential to

command much more support fron a broader base of people than nost of the right-wing

extremist groups. It seems significant to this informant that men like Vic dalton

and Bill Miller would actually get up the nerve to take to the streets in uniform,

& thing they never did for the Nazi Party although both supported it.

It is also roteworthy that the NCC was able to draw supporters from so many

other extremist groups. Taking part in this demonstration were elements from the

Nazi Party, the Tax Rebellion Connittee, the Netional States Rights Party, the Ministr,

of Christ Church and the old Secret irny Organization.

Also, this group does not automatically get adverse responses from the public

In the streets. Indeed, many passerby indicated their support for the group's aims

In the demonstration of the 8th. The leadership 1s more Intelligent and more

approachable than that of groups like the MSwPP or MCC. They more easily establlch

& good rapport with the public in general and are not so blunt in stating their racist.

JECT: Posse Comitatus.

During the last two years this informant has spent a great deal

time studying the tactics, personalities and stated goals of both.

National Socialist White People's

Party and the Ministry of Christ

Ich. Until recently I considered the NSWPP to be more of a threat

the security of peace and law in the United States than the MCC but

events of recent months have caused me to change my view of these

groups about 180 degrees. I now regard the icC to be a far greater

ace than the NSVPP is likely ever to become.

The main reason for my change of relative attitudes toward these

groups has been the increased preoccupation of certain MCC members.

Posse Comitatus. Also known as

3 the christian Posse Association,

s organization serves as the paramilitary am of the MCC. The goals

its most ardent activists seem to be very similar to those of the

sis but their autics are quite different. Instead of wrapping them-

ves in the swastika, they uphold the Christian Cross as their symbol.

ike the head-on street clashes which many of the Nazis seem to relish,

abers of

Posse Conitatus

generally tend

to preier being secretive and

indestine in their operations. They generally seem to fancy themselves

be revolutionaries and as fanatical as some of them appear, I believe

potential exists for the loade to becone a truly revolutionary group.

Dennis Loso was at one tire a major financial supporter of the

IPP. He has renounced that group since 1972 but not because of its

poses but only occause ne considers it to be inefiective. He is now

jedicated supporter of the lice and Its national leader, "illiam Gale.

so almost never

misses an HCC meeting in San Diego, frequently visits

• Glendale meetings of MCC, and more recently attended the hiCC seminar

Lanassa Ranch in Mariposa. If loso is not already an officer within

›se Comitatus, then the potential certainly exists for him to become

* Loso is also an admirer of tach Fredericks and was just elected to

San Diego County Central Concittee of the Amcrican Independent Party.

Velt Kendall, another ex-Nazi supporter who has tured to the MCC,

also a potential activist for Posse Conitatus. Rendall attends perhaps

% of Gale's meetings in San Diego and is definitely not bothered by

prospect of

using violence to attain political goals. He once sug-

sted that Sherife John Duffy of San Diego County should be ascassinatea.

Jerry Busch, a.k.a. Mark Roberts, is another man to watch.

outside the realm of normas correspondence. Two-way radio contact

seems to be his favorite. Busch onco stated his desire to murder Deputy

District Attorney Hewicker of San Diego. Busch is very suspicious

and paranoid of everyone..

• . ..:

Sian lcDade, former Secret Arny Organisation affiliate, is definitely

in the losse Comitatus piciure. He occasionally attende NCC meetings

in San Diego. A friend of George Hoover, McDade made a feoble write-in

campaign for sherist against John Duffy but it never amounted to much.

he said mupport le copired came from affiliates of the Posse.

Joe and Harriet Brinker are almost sure to be members of Posse

Comitatus. Iong time supporters of the MCC, they never miss a meeting

or other loc activity and have often driven 10ng distances across country

just to participate in such events. Herriet is definitely the brains

of this pair. In spite of their very radical political stance, however,

this infomant does not consider either one of them to be capable of a

premeditated act of violence.

George letzger seems to be very deeply involved in Posse Conitatus.

¡e is an organizer, a "take charge" man and a pretty good speaker both

n private and before groups. He is not dynamic but speaks carefully...

leliberately and with an air of sincerity and believability. Certainly

uis actions should be observed.

Joe Reedy is a close associate of Metzger. He seldom has much to

say and appears merely to be a faithful follower wno would be willing

to go along with whatever the others decide.

Bill Killer is very closely tied with the hiCC and has been för a

ong time. However, he is definitely not the violent type.. He tapes

¿very one of Gale's sermons and never misses a meeting. Gerald Smith

ticked Miller out. of

the NS"PP because he. considered him to be cowardly

nd more interested in promoting the HiCC than the NS:P?.

• Ron Eday is a man who owes allegiance to

no particular group or

leader but who could very likely becone involved in a group like Posse

ionitatus. He has been a long time supporter, if a sporadic one, of

he ISHPP. At one time Eddy was a Gale follower but he has had nothing

o do with the licC since 1972 because he now considers Gale to be a phony.

Eddy stated, however, that he is very distrustful of anyone whom

he has not known for a very long time and would definitely do some exter-

sive chcotirg into a peraon's background before trusting him as a con-

federate in any terrorist activity. Eddy seems to enjoy violence but

he is also a clever, intelligent man and should never be underestimated.

I regard him as being one of the most dangerous people named in this

report even though I do not believe him to be a member of Posse Comitatus

as yet...:

Vic Walton is another figure who is likely to have a hand in the

organization of Posse Comitatus in San Diego County. This attorey,

in this informant's opinion, presents no threai of physical violence

whatever but he serves as a sort of liaison man between the various

right-wing extremist groups in the Southern California area. He is

intelligent and seems to be fairly well off financially. Through him

many others can be reached as Walton has been involved with people in

the

NSUPP, the HCC, the SA0, Comparet's group and

virtually any other

extremist outfit in the right-wing which one might think of in this arez.

I hope this report will give you some idea as to the current status

of Posse Comitatus in San Diego County. At least I believe it to be a

fairly accurate description of some of the prime-movers

of Posse Comitatu

as of the present. Due to the more underground nature of this group,

it is more difficult to keep tabs on than is the openly Nazi Party.

However, as this organizational arn of the MCC makes the attempt to

establish itself as a force to be reckoned with and to consolidate

whatever power it might gain, certain characteristics of it are bound.

to surface and become more clear. This informant will do his best to

learn as much about this emerging group as quickly as possible and to

relay the information to you as accuiately as can be done. One thing

seens to be very certain and that is that San Diego County seems to be

Report by DON CLARK INFORmaNT

Meeting of Colonel WILLIAM GALE at

O'Neira Hall on the Evening of

March 28, 1974, San Diego, California

4/5/74

Approximately 75 persons were present at that

meeting. It included, among others, GEORGE UDVARY,

VICTOR B. WALTON, MICKEY WAKEFIELD, J. ANDREW SIMPSON,

ELLEN ADAMS, BILI, MILLER, JONATHAN WEST, JOE BRINKER,

HARRIET BRINKER, JANET BRINKER, Colonel WILLIAM GALE, ANN

NUTTER, and others who are very old and very inactive.

There were a number of individuals present who are as yet

unknown to me.

GEORGE UDVARY does not seem to have made his

move yet--permanent move out of the area. He's still in

process, I believe, as best I can tell at this time. MICKEY

WAKEFIELD came down from Escondido, was hoping to run

into some of his para-military friends, one or two of whom

did not evidently arrive. He did run into VICTOR WALTON

who he is close to. BILL MILLER was there and very involved--

on the surface at least. ELLEN ADAMS was distributing

literature. JOE and HARRIET BRINKER came in from Escondido

and of course are primarily responsible for putting on that

monthly meeting and so they were working with that.

55009 DocId: 32989524 Page 223

## Page 224

There was security that night--more so than

would ordinarily be expected. A fellow by the name of

DENNIS was inside with a 23-channel, five-watt Citizens Band

walkie-talkie, Realistic brand, sold by Radio Shack. He

kept monitoring another individual whose name I do not have

who was outside. He had a two or three channel Citizens

Band walkie-talkie, Midland brand, and they were checking

to see if anyone would give them any trouble. This was

because of a publication that indicated where their meeting

would be held. They didn't indicate what they would do if

such trouble arrived. :

Colonel GALE discussed an article on himself and

the identity movement as written up in Volume V, Issue 14,

of a bi-monthly publication, called the San Diego Door.

I believe that's a March, 1974 issue. Colonel GALE read

directly from the

article and made comments and corrections

•as he went.

• He said, now I will read--follow this and read as

much as possible that seems relevant. He read from-the

article: "But the public meetings are only part of the

• package. Whenever GALE speaks, he recruits followers into

the para-military part of his organization. That part is

called 'Identity' and has so far incorporated many old

Minutemen and secret army elements in Southern California."

To that, Colonel GALE indicated that "Identity"

was the nane of his church publication--he thought it was

NW 55009Docid: 32989524 Page 224

---

## Page 225

very humorous. that they thought it was something else.

The term is used to describe their philosophy.

The para-military part of their operation is under

such titles as the "Christian Posse Association."

I will make another quote here from the publication:

"JERRY LYNN DAVIS, the ex-head of the SAO in California,

has been reported at GALE's public meetings." According

to MICKEY WAKEFIELD who was sitting next to me during this

meeting, DAVIS had not, as far as he knew, ever been to a

San Diego meeting•

Another quote Colonel GALE made: "Identity is

organized in similar fashion to other underground organizations--

•* small cells communicate through a series of intermediaries

and blind post office boxès." Colonel GALE did not comment

further; however, the mailing network for the rational tape

groups, the Christian Posse Association groups, and the

amateur radio network are the primary communication links

. of GALE's group.

• : Another quote Colonel GALE made from the article:

"In San Diego, GALE can be heard speaking to his congregation

on the fourth Thursday of every month at the O'Neira Club

on Holly Street" or something of that nature "between 34th

and 35th Streets, one block south of Adams Avenue." The

street was incorrectly quoted--it's Hawley, and Colonel

GALE made an observation on that, indicating he thought

the information was transferred to the person at this publication

NW 55009 Docid: 32989524 Page 225

---

## Page 226

by telephone and that he figured, he had that all figured

out that way because the person must have misunderstood

the name and got it wrong.

The next quote from the publication: "According

to one law enforcement source, Identity has about 50 members

in the San Diego area, including members of the San Diego

Sheriff's Department and reserve police officers." Colonel

GALE indicated support from and for law enforcement--indicated

he has an assistant pastor in Glendale who has an important

position in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office, and

that he claims support from a number of law enforcement

areas.

...

Another quote he indicated:

"As for GALE, he

pretends to be a minister of his church and operates through

it as his front. GALE was one of the driving forces behind

the militant Christian Defense League (CDI) in the 60's.

He had formed the small California Rangers in the late 50's.

The California State Attorney General's Office described

the Rangers as," then they put a quote in here, in this article,

" 'A secret underground guerrilla force, linked with other

non-military organizations by a common ideology and leader-

ship.'

Colonel GALE indicated at this meeting the Rangers

were registered with the state and had support of California

law enforcement.

Another quote from the article that the Colonel

NW - 55009

DocId: 32989524

Page 226

---

## Page 227

made: "GALE's strategy to recruit members through veterans

organizations was thwarted in 1963 when the Long Beach Press

Telegram exposed his efforts to convert the American Legion

Post in Signal Hill into a Ranger front. It was after this

that one of the Rangers was arrested for selling a machine

gun and a stem gun to undercover agents." Colonel GALE

indicated that he was involved to some extent with this

particular post, with this particular veterans group, that

he transferred from the Hollywood post. Also, he said that

the Ranger's, that particular Ranger's arrest, was an

entrapment and an unfortunate error on that Ranger's part.

Another quote he made: "The CDI was quite an

..organization when GALE was a part of it. It grew to

; include the Klan, the National States' Rights Party, and

many other Right Wing groups." Colonel GALE admitted

connection with the Christian Defense League, indicating

that he was

very active.

Another quote: GALE has ample experience to

found a para-military organization. In addition to more

than 20 years involvement in right wing circles, GALE is

a retired Lieutenant Colonel, U. S. Army. He served with

the MAC ARTHUR command after World War. II in the counter-

Insurgency staff," and it goes on. But Colonel GALE corrected

this counter-insurgency information. He indicated that he

was on the staff of MAC ARTHUR in Japan, but previous to

NW 5500₽ DocId:32989524. Page 227

---

## Page 228

that was when he was involved in counter-insurgency and

that was with the guerrilla activities in the Philippines,

which was also indicated in this article.

Then,

another interesting thing, he quoted: "The

SAO was in large part organized by HOWARD B. GODFREY, an

FBI Agent." He didn't have arything notable to say about

GODFREY.

• Actually, one of the things he indicated, too,

in this discussion of his was that there is a lot of diffi-

culty getting different right wing groups to cooperate in

a military fashion and that that is very necessary and I

" get the impression that he is attempting and wishes to whip

these groups into line in a really efficient military manner

that will be very effective and efficient. That is the pri-

mary problem. He also indicated his willingness to cooperate

with law enforcement, of course on his terms no doubt;

and he said he was ready and they were ready to face those

Jews and their articles and their so-called exposes and

whatever else they might happen to want to do; that they

are ready to communicate with their people and take care of

anyone who gives them any trouble. He indicated that he

had communication links all over--thät from his car he

could talk immediately with his link in Saugus--I don't

know what link he was referring to, but it was in Saugus,

and in Glendale and other areas like that, which he mentioned.

That covers much of his comments at that particu-

lar meeting. There was quite a lot of response--the people

enjoyed that immensely. It was a reaction similar to a

grandstanding and I think he was milking it for all he

could get.

J. ANDREW SINPSON resides at 229 Kalmia Street,

San Diego, California 92101, telephone number in San Diego

232-5658.

There were some questions and answers during

this session.. JOE BRINKER was passing out blank pieces

of paper so that people could write their comments and

questions on the papers which were then passed up to Colonel

¡ GALE. Along with those blank pieces of paper, JOE BRINKER

had a throw-away on the tax revolt. The heading was "Sunny

. San Diego Invites You to 19.74's Biggest Tax Expo" and then

another heading, "Tax Foes Tell Why and How They Stopped

Paying Income Fax," etc., etc. It talked about meetings in

the San Diego area on that. Registration forms for special

get-togethers, in this case, Sheraton Inn-Airport on

Friday, April 5th and Saturday, April 6th, 7 P.M. to I1 P.M.

on Friday, April 5th; 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Saturday, April 6th.

For those who wish to write for information, they'd write to

(for registration or information) to Tax Expo, 1570 Lily

Avenue, El Cajon, California 92021. Now whether this point

was being stressed more by JOE BRINKER or whether it was also

under

the tacit approval of Colonel GALE, I do not know.

Underneath the application: "We wish to attend the Identity

•Seminar at Manasseh Ranch as indicated. Please place check-

mark in the appropriate seminar space." Second Seminar

or Third Seminar indicated for placement of the mark.

Following they say, "Religious services begin on Saturday,

number of adults, number of children, ages of children,

type of recreation vehicle (tent camper, truck camper, motor

UBJECT:

Thugs attack SAO member.

As you can tell by the content of the enclosed letter, terrorist

ctivity seems still to be going on in San Diego County. Il true, what

his letter says definitely refutes Paul Ruplinger's denial that he was

ter s member of the Secret Army Organization.

This beating incident also seems to bear out this informant's sus-

scions that there is a leftist underground SAO type organization operating

n.the San Diego area. Perhaps these assailents who attacked the Ruplingers

und their friend were the same group who shot up the mobile home park in

iscondido where Hickey Wakefield resides. In any event, this latest

riolence is bound to heighten tensions between the warring factions.

Ray Wilson is obviously very pleased that the zionist headquarters

In Hew York was bombed. It was news to this informant to learn that

Bay Wilson's landlady is a close friend of the ruplingers. This means

they she must be at least semi-politically aligned with the Ruplingers

and possibly even Wilson himself.

That'is about it for now.. Hope this will help.

THE STRANGE TALE OF

THE SECRET ARMY

ORGANIZATION (USA)

S

an Diego is a strange town, where the niceties of West-

ern civilization cannot hide the power of the buck

and the hint of brute force. It is the city built with

the largesse of twenty-five years of imperial sway: a

stronghold, a haven of anticommunism, a base for racke-

teers. Richard Nixon considered it his lucky city. He

wanted the Republican Convention to be held there, and

though the city fathers and the people of San Diego were

not terribly enthusiastic, the plans went forward until May

1972, when the President abruptly changed his mind.

• Included in these plans, it turns out, was a tumultuous,

massive, bloody riot-on such a scale as to justify the most

extraordinary preventive measures, including burglary, bug-

•ging, sabotage, and perhaps even kidnapping. Watergate, we

learn from the likes of John W. Dean, was simply part of a

strategy to maintain domestic tranquility in the face of a

serious left-wing threat.

Presumably, this Red Menace existed in San Diego as

well as Miami. But San Diego has never been a radical

stronghold, and while local activists did undertake extensive

preparations for anti-war demonstrations during the GOP

convention, the Committee to. Re-elect the President seems

to have had a far higher opinion of their organizing suc-

cesses than they themselves dared to entertain.

Unless, of course, CREEP and its local San Diego allies

were hell-bent on making certain that bedlam did in fact

occur. That is precisely what a defecting agent provocateur

named Lewis Tackwood suggested almost two years ago.

Tackwood told an incredible story back in October and

November 1971, one which suggested the Republicans were

doing their utmost to turn San Diego into a bloodbath

during, the convention, with the aim of annihilating the left,

smearing the Democrats, and coasting comfortably into

four more years of conservative rule. His allegations were

regarded as the ravings of a madman until testimony in the

Senate caucus room appeared to corroborate some of his

wildest stories. He told of preparations to seal off and then

bomb 100,000 demonstrators attending a rock concert on

Fiesta Island in Mission Buy, San Diego. All sorts of may-

hem was supposed to ducur. Bombs were to be smuggled

into Convention Center in hollow furniture, which was al-

Richard Popkin taught philosophy at the University of California,

San Diego and now teaches at Washington University, Sr. Louis. He

Party would be tied in to the events, discredited, possibly

outlawed. The Republican candidate would then win an

easy victory with the overwhelming support of an outraged

citizenry. Today, Tackwood sticks by his original story (to

be published in September by Avon as The Glasshouse

Tapes), though he now adds that the plan also called for

blowing up the podium as President Nixon was making his

acceptance speech!

(CIVIL WAR IN SAN DIEGO]

ncredible as the Tackwood scenario seemed back in

1971, it sounded less outlandish to San Diego radicals

than to those on the outside. For two years, they had

quite literally been engaged in protracted warfare

with right-wingers determined to drive them out of the

area. As early as 1970, activists associated with the San

Diego Street Journal, an underground newspaper, were liv.

ing in an armed fortress which they guarded around the

clock against the attacks of night riders who would shoot

into their houses, firebomb their cars and threaten their

lives. (Curiously, this terror campaign intensified as the

paper exposed more and more illegal activities of San Diego

kingpin C. Arnholt Smith.) On one occasion, for example,

sentries spotted two men crouched behind a car with a

high-powered rifle trained on the house. It was late at night, -

but they were prepared for such emergencies. At a signal,

they switched.on floodlamps which bathed the house in

light and they announced over a loudspeaker system that

they would open fire if the men did not withdraw. The

gunmen waited a moment, then dismantled their rifle; and

drove off into the night.

By late 1971, the vigilantes had stepped up their attacks

and had chosen their principal targets. One of these was a

certain Peter Bohmer, a radical who at the time was teach-

ing economics at San Diego State College. He began receiv-

ing threatening phone calls, and on November 13, 1971, a

car parked in front of his house was firebombed. Then on

December 27, 1971, a group calling itself the Secret Army

Organization put out a Special Bulletin on Peter Bohmer.

After listing his anti-war activities, and his background, the

letter said: "For any of our readers who may care to look

up this Red Scum, and say hello, here is some information

CRIMINAL RECORD

RICHARD NOVON (alias Crj-Babr Jason, alicas Tricky Dicky) is an export in disguises and

has successfully passed himself off as an anti-communist in the past.

He may again try using

this disguise if pressed for votes in 1972. Saying one thing, then doing the opposite is Nixon's

BID.s.

While he campaigned in 19ris on a platform of curtailing socialism he has in fact done

more to establish a socialistic dictaiorship than either of the last two Democrat administra-

cions.

His sconomic policies have continued to enrich Big Industrialists while rising prices

and higher taxes have all but roduced the average worker to a state of financial slavery. This

criminal has even made vicious alucks on small children (forced busing to acheire "racial

balarice') and has caused the destruction of local school systems. WARNING: Nixon suffers

from an EMPEROR COMPLEX and becomus extremely dangerous when criticized.

CAUTION

Trickery and deceit are Vixon's trade-marks.

At the present time Nixon and his chief hench

man HENRY (CZAR) KISSINGER are ongaged in forming an alliance with another gang of

criminals, the Red Chinese.

The KED CHINA GANG have slaughtered an estimated fifty

million of their own people since cuming to power.

This Godless horde of barbarians killed

thousands of Impricans in the Korean lar (shooling captured soldiors and starving and tor-

turing prisoners of war). The HaD Chisa CaNc have been supplying the WORTH VIETNAN-

ESE BANDITS with weapons in bullets to kill Amorican sokliers in another no-win war in

Vietnam.

phone number, and car license were

given, plus a physical description.

"Now, in case any of you don't believe

in hitting people who wear glasses, to

* be fair, I guess we will have to tell you

he wears contact lenses."

•On January 6,

1972, cross-hair

stickers (the symbol of the SAO) were

placed on the doors of three San Diego

State College professors, including.

Bohmer. Then, an anonymous caller

telephoned Bohmer's residence to say,

"This time we left a sticker, next time

we may leave a grenade. This is the

SAO." Bohmer's friends were called

and told to say goodbye to him. That

evening, two shots were

fired into

Bohmer's home and a woman named

Paula Tharp was wounded.

The right-wing terror campaign con-

tinued for six more months, marked

by death

threats, menacing

phone

calls, and warning messages. Its climax

came on June 19, 1972, when an SAO

• member bombed a local porno movie

• house,

the Guild Theatre. This last

event

finally aroused the San

Diego

police to drive the group underground.

Police action brought a halt, at least

temporarily, to right-wing terrorism in

San Diego. But this is not the end of

the tale. For in the months that fol-

lowed a very bizarre story began to un-

ravel, one which involved the SAO, the

FBI, and some mysterious contacts

between the terrorists and agents of

CREEP. The pieces began to appear as

early as mid-1972, but it is only in re-

cent months that they have been

pulled together by reporters for

another San Diego alternative news-

paper, the Door.

(SECRET ARMY-USA]

The SAO, it seems, grew out of

the demise of the Minutemen.

According to a recently dis-

covered document entitled "History of

the Secret Army Organization," it all

began one morning in February, 1970,

when "

... a group of six Minutemen

leaders from four states met secretly in

Northern Arizona to discuss the crisis

that the arrest and imprisonment of

two. top Minutemen leaders and the

assassination of a third had brought on

the organization. Although some of

these men had met before in their

roles as Minutemen group leaders,

others were meeting for the first

time." These men agreed that "the

Minutemen as a national coordination

organization of militant right wing

groups had effectively been destroyed •

by the pro-communist elements inside

the Justice Department," and they fur-

ther agreed that the need for a co-

ordinating organization was greater

than ever "in view of the increased

revolutionary activity by communists

in the United States." The new organi-

• zation was the Secret Army Organiza-

tion, and it would save America from

its leftward drift under. Nixon's

regime.

The initial SAO documents speak

of the immediate need to set up para-

military groups to carry on guerrilla

warfare, and even open and conven-

tional warfare. A letter from "General

Headquarters" dated November 8,

1971, outlines the nature of SAO

opérations-combat teams, organiza

tion, transportation, travel procedures,

weapons and equipment, training les-

sons, intelligence work, security, etc.

They say that the country has entered

56 RAMPARTS

NW 55009 DocId: 32989524

"Stage Il": a time when most people

still think they can still get along with

the government, but

"a few real

patriots are willing to take part in

underground activity." Stage Il "will

be a time of assassination and counter-

assassination,

terror and counter

terror." It is a period marked by "the

communist infiltration and control of

the

present United States govern-

ment."

SAO thus set out to wage total re-

sistance to communism, a small band

determined to risk all in the struggle

for America. Nationwide, the group

probably numbered less than

200

members, 30 of whom were active in

San Diego county. There the group

was founded by two men-Jerry Lynn

Davis (Southland Coordinator) and

Howard Berry Godfrey (San Diego

Commander and Intelligence Officer).

In late 1971 and the first half of

1972 the SAO put out bulletins on

how to make booby traps, how to use

ammonium nitrate in high explosives,

and how to gain forced entry into

buildings. (Much of this information

was taken from Department of the

Army Technical Manuals on "Uncon-

ventional Warfare Devices and Tech-

niques."). The San Diego SAO also put

out bulletins about local liberals, radi-

cals and anti-war activists, all of whom

were lumped together as communists.

(These missives went out to a mailing

list of 227 names in the area, including

a naval commander, a county super-

visor, a vice admiral, a Marine Corps

brigadier general, a rear admiral, and

some San Diego police officers.)

The group was organized into small,

semi-autonomous cells. Members were

listed by code numbers, and

were

given mail drops for their contacts.

## Page 241

(THE FBI CONNECTION]

S

YAO thrived in San Diego until the

June 1972 bombing of the Guild

Theatre led to the group's fall

• from grace. A former Birchite named

William Francis Yakopec was arrested

and charged with the bombing, and in

September 1972, he was brought to

trial in the Superior Court of the State

of California

in San Diego, before

Judge Robert W. Conyers. Much to the

astonishment of the SAO supporters,

the star, witness

against Yakopec

turned out to be San Diego Com-

mander Godfrey. Then a local fireman,

Godfrey admitted he had worked for

• the FBI since early 1967 as an under-

cover agent. He did it, he said, because

"I felt it was my duty to my country."

Before accepting the role, he had

• talked it over with J. Clifford Wallace,

then the Stake President of the Mormon

Church for San Diego, and more

recently a federal judge by appoint-

ment of Richard Nixon. Wallace put

Godfrey in touch with the FBI, and he

was assigned to agent Steve Christian-

son, to whom he reported verbally

every day. Godfrey was to work on

'the militant right: wing, and was paid

$250.00 per month by the FBI. At

first he was assigned to the Minute-

men, and then with the demise of that

group in San Diego, he helped start

i-mand run the SAO in November 1971.

• Godfrey testified that his, FBI contacts

knew all of his activities, including his

• stockpiling of illegal explosives in his

house. This, he said, was done with •

their permission. (He later gave some

of the explosives to Yakopec to "save

them for after the Communist take-

over of this country.")

Godfrey functioned as a orie-man

plumbers' operation within the SAO.

He knew how to pick locks, burglarize,

bomb and handle guns. The FBI paid

his dues and covered his expenses. All

this enabled him to carry on effective-

ly as a terrorist. At Yakopec's trial, he

said that he actively recruited for the

group. What kind of people did he

look for? "People with previous right

wing connections." Did he enlist po-

tentially dangerous elenients?. "Yes,

Apparently, Godfrey himself was

- among the more dangerous elements in

the SAO, and agent Christianson

grises of the operation. During the

Yakopec trial, Godfrey admitted that

he had driven the car from which

another SAO member, George Hoover,

had fired into Bohmer's house, wound-

ing Paula Tharp. Subsequently, he had

taken the weapon to Christianson,

who had hidden it for six months.

insufficient

grounds for the FBI to take disci-

plinary action against agent Christian-

son. He continued as Godfrey's con-

tact until the bombing of the Guild

Theatre, at which point he was re-

moved by L. Patrick Gray himself. He

currently resides in Kanosh, Utah.)

In addition, Godfrey confessed to

publishing a certain leaflet on Febru-

ary 18, 1972,, the day on which Presi-

dent Nixon left for China. The bulletin

was headlined "Wanted for Treason,".

and it featured a picture of Nixon and

an inflammatory text which accused

the President of high treason because

of his China policy. The SAO symbol

appeared at the bottom of the text,

and the group distributed it in 15

cities-including San Diego, Phoenix,

Yuma, San Francisco, and Bellingham,

Washington.

At the Yakopec trial, Godfrey testi-

fied that he had paid the printer for

the posters, picked them up, and was

reimbursed by the FBI, and that the

FBI understood the nature of his ex-

penditures and saw all of his SAO pub-

lications. As for poor. Yakopec, who

had joined the SAO through Godfrey,

his next door neighbor, he admitted to

owning several of the posters: he said

he stored them under his mattress.

Why there? "I thought they were kind

of corny." Later, he testified that he

kept a bomb with the Nixon posters.

Did he generally keep bombs under his

bed? "No, I like to sleep too well."

(When I visited the San Diego Court

House to see the exhibit in question,

the custodian located a stack of 33

posters, with the bomb casing still at-

tached!)

It was not noted at the time, but in

fact these posters bear a remarkable

resemblance to leaflets which were dis-

tributed in Dallas,. Texas, just one or

two days prior to the assassination of

President Kennedy. That poster like-

wise bore the headline "Wanted for

Treason" and it also featured pictures

(front and profile) of JFK and an in-

Mammatory text about the President's

241

allegedly treasonous activities. On the

hunch that the leaflet might have some

connection with the assassination, the

Warren Commission sent Secret

Ser-

vice agents to track down its author

and printer. They worked from late

November 1963, to May 1964, until

they found that Robert G. Klause had

printed the flyer and that Robert

Allan Surrey, an

associate of Gen.

Walker, had ordered it. When Surrey

testified

before the Commission on

June 16, 1964, he pled the Fifth

Amendment on all questions concern-

ing the leaflet. The late Hale Boggs, a

member of the Warren Commission,

pointed out that Surrey "is the. only

witness out of hundreds who has pled

the Fifth Amendment." Klause denied

any interest in or involvement with the

contents of the leaflet, and there the

matter was allowed to rest. By that

point, the Warren Commission was

determined to prove that Oswald had

acted alone, and therefore lost interest

in trying to connect the assassination

with the leaflet.

Godfrey's surfacing as an FBI agent

rattled the remnants. of the SAO. They

were angry at having been set up by

the FBI, and when reporters for the

Door began approaching their old ad-

versaries for information earlier this

year, they found that many were will-

ing to cooperate; some were even

friendly. And as the SAO began to

open up, a pattern began to emerge

which seemed to link the San Diego

events to Watergate.

(BREAKTHROUGH]

i The

breakthrough came

this

spring when an editor of the

Door made contact with a

former SAO militant named Jerry

Busch. From November 1969 to the

summer of 1971, said Busch, Howard

Berry Godfrey made frequent visits to

the Gunsmoke Ranch in El Cajon. "It

was also during June, July, and August

of 1971 that Berry Godfrey

and

Donald

Segretti (posing as

'Don

Simms') visited Gunsmoke and though

supposedly not 'knowing each other,'

they spoke together on at least one oc-

casion," in a quiet conversation aside.

The Segretti connection is important

in itself; it is particularly interesting in-

sufar as-according to Busch's account

-Sergretti was in touch with SAO

---

## Page 242

while contacting his old college chums

Chapin and Strachan in June 1971,

but before commencing work as a

dirty trickster in September 1971.

Busch did not say what Segretti dis-

•cussed at the Gunsmoke Ranch, but he

did report that following "these casual

conversations" Godfrey came up with

bizarre ideas to take care of what he

called "those red punks" —in the event

that the GOP held its convention in

San Diego. Among Godfrey's plans in

October 1971, were:

1) the use of massive dosages of LSD,

cyanide or strychnine introduced

into the punch at anti-war group

meetings;

2) bombing

of the VVAW head-

quarters, the Guild Theatre, and

several porno shops;

3) bombings of the homes or offices

of anti-war leaders;

4) kidnapping or assassination of anti-

war leaders and activists;

5) fire bombing of vehicles and other

-property belonging to anti-war ac- .-

tivists.

By November and December 1971,

Busch continued, Godfrey had become

more ambitious: he wanted to acquire

drone planes which would carry pay-

loads of high explosives and phospho-

rus to be. dropped on the demon-

strators. In addition, Godfrey spoke of

using similar air craft, loaded

with

TNT. or C-4 plastique, to blow up Air

Force One and assassinate Nixon. The

• idea was to fly a bomb into the Presi-

dential jet as it landed either at Lind-

bergh Field or at El Toro Marine Base.

Busch claimed. that he had expressed

horror at the suggestion and told God-

frey he had lost his mind suggesting

anything as insane as an attempt on

the life of the President. Shortly there-

after, Busch and Godfrey parted ways

after the former grew suspicious that

he was being set up to take the rap on

the shooting of Paula Tharp. By

March 1972, he had left San Diego

and has not yet returned.

Even before Busch left the SAO,

the "Wanted for Treason" leaflet was

printed

and

distributed.

Another

former SAO member corroborates that

• in this same :erod-January-February,

1972-Godf.uy tried to find someone

to build a pline that would carry a

load of high explosives. (In addition,

he was apparently trying to obtain

another plane for the purpose of gas-

sing or bombing demonstrators on

-NW-55009_DocId: 32989524

_Page 242

Fiesta Island.) After Busch's depar-

ture, the SAO issued its April 1972,

bulletin, which began with a quote at-

tributed to Abraham Lincoln,

rant would not come to the United

States from across the sea. If he

comes, hell ride down Pennsylvania

Avenue from his inauguration and take

up legal residence of the White

House.

." Then followed detailed in-

structions on the manufacture of ex-

plosives which might be used to de-

stroy a large bridge (Tackwood's

scenario included the demolition of

two bridges on and off of Fiesta Is:

land) and

on various methods of

forced entry into buildings.

IA SINISTER PLOT?

Yas there a right-wing plot to

kill the President? Tackwood

says so. Busch says that FBI

informer Berry Godfrey talked about

it. The "Wanted for Treason"

poster

certainly indicated no loss of love be-

tween the extreme right and the Presi-

dent, and Godfrey was checking out

the availability of drone planes.

There are other curious, if admit-

tedly inconclusive, clues as well: The

day Nixon went to China, E. Howard

• Hunt was working as a public relations

man on a Julie Nixon Eisenhower TV

spot. He raged about the China trip;

"We should not send people to China,

we should send bombs to China." This

from a man supposedly involved in a

secret scheme to re-elect the President

by illegal means.

Or take this item which appeared in

the March 9, 1972, issue of the N.Y.

Times (10 days after Nixon's return

from China):

WAR ALERT SENT IN HOAX

BY A COAST GUARDSMAN

"New Orleans, March & (UPI)-An en-

listed man standing watch sent a hoax

message to ships at sea during Presi-

dent Nixon's visit to China, saying the

President had been assassinated • and

the Vice President had declared World

War III, the Coast Guard revealed yes-

terday.

"The authorities said that the hoax

message had not been taken seriously

and that the man who sent it from a

small Coast Guard station in Texas had

been confined and was undergoing

medicai evaluation.

"Tie message was sent February 27

by teletype to 22 ships in the Gulf of

Mexico."

There was no further story on this

that i have been able to find. If the

hoax message had gone out to a Polaris

submarine, Hunt might have gotten his

wish;

that bombs would be sent to

China.

Then, the L.A. Times reported on

July 13, 1973 that a former Minute-

man had requested political asylum in

Fiji, saying he had secret information

on Watergate and feared assassination.

All of this proves nothing, of

course, but it suggests that the Dirty

Tricks operation' may have been much

more complex than we have been led

to believe. Perhaps there was a plot to

kill Nixon, and then again Godfrey's

plot may have been a further hoax

aimed at discrediting the left and the

Democratic Party. What did Segretti

discuss with Godfrey, and why and

how did he meet Godfrey in the first

place? How did it happen that the FBI

financed a threat on the life of a Presi-

dent (a crime which carries a penalty

of up to five years in jail and a $1,000

fine)? In the past, the Secret Service

has taken such threats very seriously.

A check of the New York Times index

shows that at least 11 people were ar-

rested between January, 1972 and

May 1973 for doing much less than

Godfrey. Most seem to have been

psychopaths or drunks, with no posi-

tive plan-just verbal threats.

But then there are other instances:

Arthur Bremer's Ottawa visit on April

13-14, 1972, for example, when he

supposedly stalked Nixon. On May 30,

three bombs demolished the tomb of

the father of the Shah of Iran an hour

"before Nixon was scheduled to lay a

wreath there. On August 11, a certain

A. B. Topping was arrested in New

York after paying an undercover agent

$1,000 to kill Nixon. Topping, it

developed, was well-to-do, of the

American Nazi political persuasion,

and interested in having the President

killed the week after the pay-off. No

trial has been held. And then in late

May 1973, one of Nixon's helicopters

went down in the Bahamas. It subse-

quently came out that the President

has three helicopters ready at all times

and chooses which to use one minute

before the flight.

Watergate has uncovered

an ad-

ministration racked by factionalism.

Under Hoover, the FBI was at odds

with

degree

that Hoover was willing to use

secret documents to blackmail the

President. In addition, Nixon was

having his difficulties with the leaders

of the CIA, and James McCord wrote

to John Caulfield at Christmas, 1972;

that if Nixon pushed out Helms and

invol ind the forest Wat ate, "Coura

there have been other tensions as well?

Were there elements which opposed

Nixon for his policy of rapprochement

with China and Russia, and which

would have preferred, say, Spiro

Agnew as President?

After returning from San Diego in

•July 1972, acting FBI director, L.•

Patrick Gray, talked to Nixon and

said: "Mr. President, there is some-

thing I want to speak to you about.

Dick Walters and I feel that people on

your staff are trying to mortally

wound you by using the CIA and the

FBI ...

." His words may have carried

greater import than any of us have

heretofore suspected.

*

In August of this year,

Godfrey

reportedly admitted to the San Diego

Door that there was a real plot to kill

Nixon. He blames the plan on his erst-

while cohort, Gary Lynn Davis.

SAN DIEGO (LNS) -- A leader of a right-

wing paramiliary group responsible for

several armed allachs on radicals here

was partly organized and. funded by an in-

former for. the Federal Bureau of Investi-

gation.

former Southern California coordinator

for the wellarmed Secret Army Organiza-

tion (SAO), FBI infonner Howard Berry

eral fire bombings and burglaries, while

receiving regular payments from the FBI.

Accordiny to Davis' account, the SAO

was formed in 1971 to organize a "resis~

tance moicthent", should the t.S. be con-

querca by a tercign power. Godirey, the

FBl informor, was one of the sis founding

members and contributed money used lo,

print the group's recruiling literature. Da-

ris also esplained that Godfrey consistently'

ook & "more militant line" than most of the

members.

In col:: testimony, Godircy admitted

that he was riding in a car on January 6, 197

¿ Of Godfrey's confillution lo the SAO in

story to a reportor aitor boing released

from jail where he was being held awaiting

sentencing on a charge of possession of ex-

plosives.

According to The Door, Segretti came to

San Diego in March 1972 and talked to a 30

year old student at San Diego State College,

Ron Johnson. Johnson was asked to help out

in preparation for the convention. He was

asked if he had any longhaired friends who

weren't doing anything. Specifically he was

asked what lie krew about radical professor

Peter Bohmer and activist Paula Thaip.

Fox stated that he was approached many times by Berry Godfrey

He tried

to seil fox illegal weapons, etc. and invited him to

join the s.A.0.

Berry Godfrey vas a paid agent for the I'BI for at least

.5

years and was assigned

to investigate Right-wing Organizations.

Fox said that (odfrey hung around his station alot but that he

did not join as he was doubtful of the organization.

In May, Fox wert to Washington to march with McIntyre in the

¡While he was.alray, FBI agents through an informer, Mr. Pittman

working for fox, went through various files without permission.

Upon his return from washington, fox tried to discover why all

the interest from the FBI.

After many phone calls and many

days. he was told tnat since he was a former menver of the

Minutemen, involved with the S.A.O, a known wallace supportei,

Duriny this time fright after the theatre bombing) Fox stated

tho rol vont to Iroy Haughten's mothers home in Lallesa and did.

some extensive digging in the backyard and found nothing, they

then left with no explanation.

Fox also made the comment that Tackwood, Los Angeles Police Dept.

Undercover igent, quit recently and stated he diá so vecause,

*I don't want to plant bombs and kill delegates to the convention

to be held in San Diego".

Tackwood has written a book called,

"Glass House", soon to be released, it deals with that aspect of

his lifc.

Pox feels the FBI and Godfrey are ecruiting and pushing to involve

right-wingers

in illegal operation:; along with the police depart-

ment (bombing and laying the blame on the right-wing), were setting

the stage for a riot so.Marshall La: could be called and U.N.

• In coiclusion:

¡There were no real points made, or a moral or even much of

a discussion dealing with ways

to keep out infilrators.

They

plich for funds to holp fox pay for his Perjury trial

($5, 100. 00):

Thost in attendance seemed to enjo? the tall: but nothing con-

structive came out of the meeting.

I alss sensed that Rod Duff is trying to pull himself out of

a slunp or depression.

when menticning it to Julie Hanna,

she sIreed saying that her friend lick Rogers has also stated

same (he is a member).

He fell short as a leader in my opinion, as he asked the group

what chey would like to do and wha: type of meetings they

wanted - he should have told them what he had going and got the

people busy and active right then.

I asked him, after the meeting, what the dues ware and did he

do for the council or did the council do for him anà the move-

ment - he looked startled and replica, "I'm afraid right now I

do for the council".

- looks to me like he needs the up and

coming seminar to put him back on tis feet.

One other note - Fox feels like Yalopic was paid off as his

wife seens to have alot of money and a brand new car.

informed by them that they had discovered his gate open

and his front door unlocked during the day time hours

on June 11, 1913 He further advised that in one of

the Secret

Army Organization trials, HOWARD BARRY CODEREY

had testitied that JERRY LYNN DAVIS had known about the

weapons stolen from MARSHALL.

MARSHALL could not recall

whether GODFREY had testilled that he had actually at

the time seen these weapons or had testified that he had

merely been informed of these weapons by DAVIS.

MARSHALL stated that he desired to know

whether or not the FBI had any intormation regarding his

weapons and his primary interest was to recover his

weapons.

MARSHALL was advised that all information

furnished by HOWARD BARRY GODFREY to the FBI regarding

violations ot local or state statutes had been disseminated

to the appropriate local or state agency, and that he

should contact the San Diego County Sheritt's Oftice as

that agency would have jurisdiction over the burglary

which occurred at his residence. He said he had

•been in

contact with the San Diego County Sheritt's Oftice,

and had

been advised that his weapons had not been recovered and

that the Sheritt's Office had no information regarding

the whereabouts of these weapons.

MARSHALL Lurther advised that he is aware of the

location of the Gunsmoke Ranch, but does not Irequent

this location, and again advised that he has never met any

of the persons affiliated with the Secret Army Organization

except RICHARD FLEURY. He turther advised that FLEURY has

a considerable number of weapons at his residence, including

shot guns, rifles, and automatic pistols. He has made

statements to the effect that he will not again be taken

alive.

MARSHALL expressed his personal point that LEURY is

mentally unbalanced, and turther advised that FLEURY is

highly critical of all law entorcement in general, and of

the FBI, Inparticular. He said ELEURY plans to tile suzt

or the san Diego County Sheritt's Ottice tor the

return of weapons which were seized from him at the

time of his arrest. He said that FLEURY also talks

about going to South America and is highly critical

of the United States Government in his conversations.

MARSHALL further advised that GENEVIEVE FLEURY in con

versation with other neighbors which have been related

to MARSHALL, has indicated that she thinks her husband,

is planning to do something "out of the

by out of the ordinary, and further advised that he has had

no direct conversation with her, but has been hearing

these rumors from other people, and he expressed the

opinion that FLEURY's departure from the United States

may be what these rumors refer to.

He said that GENEVIEVE

FLEURY has indicated to neighbors that RICHARD FLEURY

thinks that she will accompany him to South America,

but, in fact, she does not plan to go with him if he. does

leave this country.

MARSHALL advised that he is not on friendly

terms with FLEURY, in that he somewhat suspects FLEURY of

burglarizing his home, and he feels that FLEURY does not

trust him. He said he would relay any information regarding

FLEURY's activities to this office, but said that because

of his relationship with FLEURY, he would not bee in a

position to actively seek information regarding FlEURY's

plans.

LYNCH

Evidence is accurmiating that if

you are. Jewish or Negro, you can

PARTI:

break the lav with impunity, but if

you are White and a patriot, you

are a ser indi-class citizen. There is a growing

double st ndard of justice in the U.S.-harsh pun-

ishment for patriots (secured by the perjury of

federal ajents) and leniency for the Left.

Last month saw two outrageous miscarriages of

justice in San Diego. On Iecembe: 21, ten tax

protestors were cieclared "guilty" of "conspiracy

to rescue seized property" by a jury

which

followed the promptings of a federal judge.

Judge Leland C. Nielsen clearly had received

orders from higher-ups to conviet the ten de-

fendants, no matter what he haci to do. He show-

ed open contempt for the rights of the accused,

refusing even to recognize that the Fleck Mare-

house-the focus of the picketing that led federal

agents to physically assault the patriots and ar-

rest them on trumped-up charges-had not even

been legally seized by the IRS until the day after

the arrest of the defendants!

The federal agents involved perjured themselves

on the witnesss stand but the jury (compoied in

large part of bureauerats and others whose salaries

are paid for by tases) refusec to believe that FII

and Treasury agents would act in the criminal

manner they did and then lie under oath.

Although prosecition testimony was inconsist-

ent, distorted ind contradictory, Nielson hr isquely

dismissed de ense motions and objections and

upheld the prosecution throughout.

The other lynching bee in San Diego concerned

two men who were admittedly entrappid by an-

dercover FBI agent-provacateur Howar:. Godfrey.

Undisputed are the facts that Gudificy incited

William F. Yakopec into bombing a porno movie

house, and even supplied the dypamite.

Yakopec was convicted "of the bombing on

Godfrey's testimony. A witness for Yalopec, Cal-

vin Fl. For, was subsequently conied of per-

jury on Godtrey's testimony, although the evidence

cleariv indicacted that Fox was colling the truth

national relations. President Nixon

abruptly reversed his previous anti-

Communist stince. The machinations of his for-

eign policy mentor, Dr. Henry A. Kissinger, re-

sulted in a detente with Peking and loscow,

was enthusinstically supported by the

"liberal" news media and paved the way for

Nison's highly publicized trips to Red China and

Suviet Russia. The gencral public, bemusca and

confused by an avalanche of promotional publicity

featuring world peace as the ultimate goal, was

cajoled into accepting the bland assurances of the

Kissinger-Nixon team. WO readers had been fore-

warned about the Nixon-Kissinger scheme of

Soviet-American convergence as the first step in

the Grand Design of One World Government.

In reviewing the many exclusive news items of

WASIINGTON OBSERVeR in the course of 1972 it

will be noticed that on March 15, 1972, WO ex-

clusively reported that Nixon's bagman and po-

litica! mastermind, Murray M. Chotiner, was

surreptitiously channelling funds to the pro-Com-

munist People's Party. The purpose of the oper-

ation was to draw left-wing votes from Democrat

candidates. This was the first reported act of

sabotage against the Democrats.

On May 1, 1972, WO exclusively reported:

'... In his desire to run as the 'Peace President'

in November 1972, President Nixon has let the

Kremlin leaders know that he is ready to grant

the Soviet-occupied countries of Central and

European security in Flelsinki and the moves nfoot

Germany as a sovereign government doom the

Edisor:

Your articles in AMERICAN MERCURY have

been vary interesting although those on "The

Economy" and

"The Money Supply" are

partially hogwash. I don't object when a

writer expresses.

his opinion even though

different from mine. but when you make a

staiement in your Newsletter which is in error

($145, Sept. 15th, 1972, last page) quote,

"for every dollar

• the national debt

which has been manufaciured by bookkeepinz

entry," you are in error. The real truth

is

that the entry is not manujactured but is

very real.

The process is that the U.S. Treasurer has

a supply of unsigned engraved U.S. Goven-

ment

Bonds which when the Fed "buys

boaris" are taken to the U.S. Treasurer ião

signs them, retums them and then the Fed

"buys" them by running oft on ? printing

press an equivalent amount of fiat paper

iaoeiied "Treasury' Notes" such as used by

the public. These notes are no longer "re-

deamable in lawful money of the U.S." as

they used to te because there is none. Only

a relatively small amount of illegally debased

coinage. These. notes have no value. being

merely paper with ink on them.

Meanwhile, the American Public pays in-

terest on the U.S. Government Bonds to the

tune of over $15,000,000,000 (Fifteen Billion

Dollars) every jea.. "

That certainly is not a manufactured book-

keeping entry. The Treasury notes are phoney

but the Bonds in possession oi the Fed are

very real, also the interest as it comes due.

He did this to warn Brown that he thought the Cuban Guerrilla

that he had just nailed a letter but would send anouher one right

Stockton, California

December 3, 1972

At about 9:30 p.I. on December 3, 1972, a meeting

of the Tax Rebellion Committee was held at

• the home of

-FRANGIS-GILLINGS, 1826. East Street; Tracy, California.

Present at the meeting was FRANCIS CILLINGS, his son JAitS

GILLINGS; GEORGE BOOF IR, and JAIlS KLETAil.

1. After a short social meeting in GILLINGS' house,

the group moved out of the house and into GILLINGS'. car,

a late model four-door white Imperial, where the discussion

began. JAMES KLATMAN mentioned that GILLINGS had missed

several meetings at his house in stockton, California, and

when GILLINGS apologized and explained he was extremely

busy wiich the lax Rebellion business, KLElMAN then asked

when they would start using their ammunition, reierring

to the IRs "seizure" notices.

GILLINGS stated that he had just returned from

a meeting with JIM SCOIT of Fresno, and thatl after he and

scorT returned from the San Diego Eleven trial, they would

get the ball rolling in conjunction with other groups in

GILLINGS also mentioned the name of ANITA

KERNs'in conjunction with the ineeting of SCOTT in Fresno,

but her position in the conversation was not clear.

distributing the "seizure notices""

GEORGE BOOFER stated that a few individuals

in California would

make little impact.

KLEIMA mentioned that he thought the literature

was being intercepted in the mails as they were having

trouble getting materials.

FRANCIS GILLINGS remarked that it was common

knowledge that the U. S. Postal Service was a bunch of

crooks, so the material is put in an envelope and mailed

NN 55009 DooId: 32989524 Page 300

---

## Page 301

5170

with a return address that was picked out of the phone

book at random. That way if it was seized, the return

address would be an innocent victim and would raise hell

if he was tabbed as the sender

GILLINGS further related that some time after

December 5, 1972, he would contact KLEIMA andjin the mean-

time they were to try to recruit some SDS members from

the campus ofy San Joaquin Delta College and University of

the Pacific to help distribute the seizure notices. He

advised all packages were to be packaged with rubber gloves

and a half of a $10 bill was to be mailed with the seizure

notices and a letter explaining the time, date of placement,

and the area to be covered.

were placed,

the other half of the $10 bill would be mailed to the

persons placing the seizure notices.

GILLINGS advised that, after January 1, 1973, he

was going to buy ten-second spots on IV, advising taxpayers

that the only way to pay their taxes is by tearing up their

return forms. He also mentioned that the movement was going

to advertise on radio and in the "Stockton Record" for sales-

men to sell a special tax package at $5 each with a profit

of $4 for the salesman.

GILLINGS advised he would call KLEIMAN and

BOOF'ER to notify them of the date to prepare plans for

distribution or seizure notices..

GILLINGS also advised during the meeting that a

complete and total collapse of the United States Government

was approaching. All big banking institutions were shipping

their gold to Europe in preparation for this financial

depression and the rise in the Dow Jones averages was a

ruse to throw off the merican public to the situation at

hand. He related that this information was relayed to him

from a high-up government source and this collapse was

coming within the next 30 to 180 days:

## Page 302

GlutNgs then said that some people in the

- movement were planning to assassinate the President and

Vice President of the United States. He related that plans

were being laid to assassinate them when they were together

at the same time and certain judges were being selected as

targets because of their leftist tendencies.

that some members of the law enforcement agencies were in

sympathy with their plans?

JIMES KLEIMAN remarked that it was about time

Comrade KISSliGER and his flunkies, MXON and AGNE, were

dealt with

in the right manner..

During the meeting, JAMES GILLINGS showed that

he was carrying a .22 revolver on his side and stated it

was ready for action.

After the meeting, KLEIMAN mentioned that certain

Secret Army Organization members had infiltrated certain

communist groups and were being assigned target members

to be killed off when the time for rebellion was launched.

Remarks:

Source advised that some time during the last two weeks in

October, 1972, JEPRY LYNY DAVIS, leader of the Secret Army Organization

in San Diego,

advised one of his close confidants in the SAO that

he had discontinued the ise of two mail drops, namely: Artist Supply,

P. 0. Box 503, Lemon Grove, California; Survival Supply, P. 0. Box

1362, Spring Valley, California.

DAVIS. Lamented that, because

the current court proceedings against certain members of the SAO in

the San Diego area, the SAO has become defunct as an organization;

that unaffected elements of the SAO may possibly band together, but

probably under a different label.

DAVIS indicated that a small

pocket of SAO members exist in the Los Angeles area, and two members

are in the Seattle area. These were not identified by name.

Dear Sirs:

I saw one si your recruiting stickers and am writing to see

I have been fighting "Conmunisn" in this country since 1947.

Several organizations have had my support. I found them and

their leaders to be fine dedicated patriots but due to very

unfortunate circumstances none have been able to survive as

active fighting groups.

I head the Patriot Militia of The Pree

Angricen Group which

has become very inactive for the gait

whize years due to

my eIlarts to analganate with larger stronger organizations.

Please send me any information that you nigit care to. I in

return will send you inatever information you desire on me.

In this manner we can look each other over to sea if a mutual

benefit could be established in the figat to light for a

Free America.

You may lenow

me as I have been very active over the years. I

may

know you but that renains to be seen when you contact

me. I hope that you have

"something on the bali" that nill

be what we need to fight imerica's enemies fron ithin and

otherwise.

I look forward to hearing iron you..

POLICE DEPT., the EL

CAJO! FOLICE DEFT., the

SCHOL, TOBACCO, & FIRDARHS DIV

ON of the U.S. TREASURY

DEPT., and the SAN DIEGO COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPT.)

ir Sirs:

de, the undersigned, vigorously protest the arrests of inlliam f. Yakopec, George l.

over, San Davis, and'ir. & irs. Richard j. Fleury-all of whom were arrested in connec

on with alledged "Secret irty Organization" activity. •

Iside from the question of their direct zuilt or innocence, there is the matter of the

curstances surrounding their arrests, the importance of which overshadows the question

culpability. Te are referring to the

aross imbalance of justice exhibited in excessive

rveillance, harassment, and poralties for Rightist and 'nite Racialist activists, as con-

asted to the aimost universai leniency granted the Radical left.

ie hear constantly of riots, Viet Cong flags being raised over l.S. cities and institu-

mus; of lenessness, murder, violence, conspiracy. In connection with these sordid pieces

news, we typically her of token arresis (or no arrests), light sentences (if any):

wittals, slaps on the wrist. In short, the ieft ring in this connory, as in most

untries, flagrantly breaks the law with little or no consequence to themselves.

The salient point is this: the Radical left consistently breaks the lair to advance their

na, ant generally gets anay with it-constituting a clear and present danger to the inter-

I securäty of imerica. It is also apparent that the "authorities" have abdicated from

air responsibilities to ston this threa, and have instead stooped to soving on Pickist

¿ Racialist groups and individuals-ühe ovarwelning rajority of whom are jar-no-ding.

In this repressive and threatening atmosphere it is hardly surprising that patriotic

ericans are sorely tempted to rosort to violent reans to preserve their liberties. From

is siaple observation no can drair the following conclusion: THE ALLEDGED INCIDENTS 125g •

I HAVE TAKEN PLACE IF THE LAY-NECACE-ENT ACENCIES HAD ERA DOING TIEIR JOBS. The faci

at the agencies in question did not do their jobs in sealing with the left meant that for

i the safety of us all someone else had to do it for them the best may they knew for. ira

at "somone else", wavever they may beg should not be held culrable for what altimately

punts to the "authorities'" derelicion of duty to stop treason, sedition, and subversion.

He consequently demand three things: the dismissal of ali changes against the aforementiones

uspects", the end of a11 surveillance of Rizhtist in shite Racialist soups and indivin

als, and strict enforcement of the lair against All leitist miscreants.

SUBJECTS: Activities

Dennis LosO--Joint acti

-es of NSWPP & SAO.

Enclosed you will i ad a newspaper clipping ad photograph which

describes the opening of the John Schnitz for President headquarters

in Escondido. As described in the clipping, Dennis Loso is the second

man from the right. It figured that loso would be. involved in this

because he was a great Schmitz supporter long before this presidential

race. The other three men I do not know.. However, there are some of

his hunting and political associates of which I could tell you something.

One is Wesley Rounds. This man has been worked on for a long tihe by

Jose. Politically, he has always tended toward the right, but loso has

zucceeded in bringing him much farther along toward National Socialism.

Rounds is manager of

the Califomian Motel. It is located in Escondido

at the northeast comer of Hwy 395 and Washington Avenue. Rounds' exact

age I do not know but I would guess him to be somewhere in his 40s.

Sometime back Ioso took Rounds to his first William Gale service

at Oneira

Hall in San Diego. Rounds seemed impressed with Gale. Wes is married.

• Another man who periodically visits Loso is Al McDonald. Al is 40

years old and is a friendly, congenial type of person. He is single and

opends much of his time in Montana "living the good life." in never he

runs low on money, he comes down to Escondido and works for Dennis for

a while. He claims that he managed to live on just $3,000 last year.

McDonald also spends a fair amount of time living in Montague, Califomia.

This town is located in Siskijou County near the. Oregon border. McDonald's

parents also Ive there. They very much disapprove of his Nazi sympathies.

on one occasion, his Mother found a large swastika in his cabin while he

wasn't there. She threw it in his wood burning stove and would have burned

It except that she couldn't find any matches.

His most récent visit to

Escondido was in July and August at which time he gave the swastika flag

to Loso for safe keeping. Loso allowed McDonald to stay rent free in

one of his unoccupied apartments.

-

I learned from Gerald Smith recently that as long as öne year ago,

there were joint target practice sessions between members of the NSWPP

and the SAO. The site of these little excursions was the Gunsmoke Fanch.

Gerald says the place is virtually a stronghold of the Minutemen, Farti-

cipants in the target shooting sessions most frequently were Gerald Smith,

Ray Wilson, lrs. Ray Wilson, Stanley lcDade, Jerry Lynn Davis and George

M. Hoover. Gerald says Hoover is a crack shot with either a rifle or

pistol. Gerald himself qualified as an expert rifle shot in the service.

Special Agent in Charge

Federal Bureau of Investigation

San Diego, California 92103

Dear Mr. Shroder:

In connection with the investigation and prosecution of the

shooting of Paula Tharp, for which Geroge M. Hoover has been indictad,

I have received correspondence from Mr. Hewicker of the San Diego

County District Attorney's Office asking whether I would be willing to

testify in this matter.

The purpose of this testimony would be to

substantiate the reliability of Howard Godfrey as an informant and to

provide information as to the custody of the weanon involved. I have

Indicated to Mr. Hewicker that I would not be unwilling to furnish

such testimony but would be somewhat reluctant due to my present

circumstances. It would appear to me that the interests of the Bureau

and the District Attorney's Office, as well as myself, would be better

served if this information was furnished by someone still connected

with the FBI. sodfrey's reliability should be a matter of record to

which Eorl Petersen could easily testify. Furthermore Mr. Petersen

has some first-hand knowlege as to the location of the weadon, and,

because of the nature of the incident, I imagine my testimony

respect would need as much substantiating as Godfrey's.

Another decided disadvantage for me would be the disclosure

of my oresent whereabouts to individuals such as representatives of the

"Door", to whom you made reference in your letter of the Fifteenth.

I do not desire to be located or contacted by these or similar

neoDle.

However, if this should occur, I intend to state merely that I left

the Bureau on the advice of my personal physician, which would have

been an actuality within a period of a few weeks or months anyway.

I would certainly appreciate it if such a course of action

as I have mentioned could be made feasibla.

Sincerely!

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

UNDERGROUND BULLETIN

GENERAL HEADQUARTERS

JUNE 1972

" The people never give up their liberties but under some delusion". Edmund Burke

Fellow members,

At a recent meeting of the SAO General Staff a very important problem was discusse

and the decision to issue a new Organizational Directive made. The problem is thai ci

new members who join our organization and then immediately become totally inactive.

Typically these new members submit a well qualified application form together with

their membership fee. Unfortunately, after being accepted as provisional raembers

they never pay a month's dues or send in any report forms. It would really help us to

know why some of these people have acted in this way. Did our organization turn out

to be something different than they expected? Did they expect a fancy uniform and rifl:

to be handed to them on a silver platter? Or did they suddenly become afraid to stick

their neck out ?

Whatever the reasons, it isn't fair to our good members to waste time and money ca

those who do nothing to help or support the organization. Therefore, effective imtae-

iately, the following rules shall apply to such cases as mentioned above.

1. It, three months after submitting an application to the SAO and being accepted a:

a provisional member, the new member has not begun the basic correspondence iraiias

submitted monthly report forms, paid monthly dues, or provided a reasonable excuse

for not having done the above, their file shall be turned over to our Inteiligence Section

for special attention.

2. If, after six months, the member in question dosen't respond they shall be drog

from ouz rolls and their names shall be circulated to all members as a potential see:cia

risk.

We don't mean to imply that a member can't resign from the Secret Army Organianti

However, we do require that a member notify us of there intent and reasons for doing

If this new Organizational Directive applies to any member in particular let him take an.

and govern himself accordingly.

HO

'O PREPARE CUNS FOR STOR

& BURYING

Although cosmoline can be purchased in many surplus stores, it may be more

practical to make your own from the following directions. One advantage to makilig

your own preparation is that it is much easier to apply while it is in a warm state.

Heat non-bleached petroleum jelly (ember-vaseline) in a small pan or can. Add

30 or 40 weight motor oil to obtain the proper consistency. Using an inexpensive

throw-away paint brush as an applicator, brush the warm solution over the weapon.

While the solution is still warm ii can also be poured into those hard-to-get-ai-areas.

One large jar of petzoleum jelly and approximately one-half quart of motor oil

is sufficient to prepare several yeapons.

When the solution has cooled it will set and form a protective coating over the

weapon which should then be wrapped in sheet plastic ( available in most hardware or

paint stores) or in a G. i. plastic gun case (available in most surplus stores ). Wrap

well and seal with black electrical or plastic tape. It is also wise to erclose a small

sack of silicagel crystals to keep the moisture out.: These crystals can be purchased

at any industrial chemical house or most applicance stores will give there away as they

come with cartons of appliances when shipped and they usually have an abundance on

supply.

Long guns which cannot be easily torn down can be stored in surplus rocket type

boxes readily available in most surplus stores.

Try to obtain aluminum or stainless

steel containers since they will not tend to rust when buried. 20mm ammunition cans

are adequate and a convienient size container for burying smaller weapons and other

items. They should be well sealed. The cans should be wrapped in plastic io prevent

rust.

Buried containers should have at least one and a hali feet of earth over them. Que

should be careful also in selecting an area to bury material. Areas that could be ficeded

during even the most unusual weather conditions should be avoided.

Buried containers should be in such a position that they can be found easily and

quickly ivithout the use of maps.

This can be done by correlation between two or more

specific points that will remain in tact, such as trees, large rocks, etc. To assist

your memory, paces should be marked off by using the day, month, and year of your

birth or that of some family member which you can easily remember.

Another suggestion would be for burying containers along or near roadways waion

are marked with numbered signs indicating the foolage of road per county.

Thase siyas

are permanent, but it must be remenbered that the state has a 500 foot righ airay o

most roads which means the brush may be cleared or the existing road might be widened.

All material which is buried should un checied within three to sin wecks for sottlimy

of sinking of the ground.

GENERAL RULES OF GUERRILLA WAARE

1. The first rule of guerrilla warfare is co dispense with any

rule or set of rulas which results in routine of predictable activity.

Any time the enemy commander can

anticipate what the guerrilla band

will do next, he can then lay a trap by which his superiority of

numbers and equipment may be brought to bear upon them with devasta-

ting effect.

2. Militazy action by guerrilla bands cannot achieve maximum

effect unless intelligence and security capabilities are developed to

an equal degree of parfection, principally through the cooperation of

friendly nor-combatants.

Propaganda warfare is one of the guerrillas nost effectiva

weapons. It must be waged continuously to denoralize the enemy,

enlist support of the civilian population and to justify the existence

and actions of the guerrilla bands.

Each member of the underground novement must be rendered

Immune to the enemy's propagenda by continuous counter-propaganda.

They must realize that the enemy is certain to spread lies about their

leaders, to try and break the bands up by encouraging petty jealousies

and dissensions, to make them feel their fight is hopeless, to encourage

them to get on the winning side, to offer mercy and rewards to those

who voluntarily surrender.

Most of all enemy propaganda will be aimed

as destroying the individual organization member's faith in the honasty,

capability and true.motives.of other members of the underground nove-

•ment.

5. Sutprise is the main element of successful guerrilla warfare.

No matter how vigilant the enemy may be there will be times your band

can take him by surprise. Perhaps he is tired, pernaps sleeping,

perhaps he is in an area where he feels so completely safe that he

lets down his guard-- that's when you hit him.

•.

6. • Any guerrilla that wants to keep on living must constantly

remind himselt that war is not a sporting proposition-- never give the

communists an even break.

7. Genarally speaking guerrillas must work in small bands. From

five to fifteen is usual but even here its best not to get into a rut.

If the encay commander in your area knows you always work in small

groups he can then divide his available anti-guerrilla forces into

groups of 1s to 25 and thus cover more ground than if ha had to main-

tain groups of two or three hundred to make certain his forces would

always out number any guerrilla band they happened ucon.

8.

The guerrill leader must always keep its thinking one step

ahead of the enemys. Here are some examples:

NW 55009 DocId: 32989524 Page 362

---

## Page 363

A staff ca

Iled with enciny officers is

welling along the

highway when the

driver sees sonothing ahoed.

they dras closer

they see it is a man, apparently dead, spraviod in the middle of

the highway. The car stops and the enemy pificois güt out so in-

vestigate.

Suddenly the "corpse" rolls over and curs them down

with a machine gun.

This little trick mighe work several times but eventually the

enemy will figure it out.

The driver of a truck full of enemy troops

sees a "corpse" lying in tho road.

Quickly he stops the truck. The

troops pile out of the truck and riddle the "corpse" with bullets.

Too late they discover its only a dummy made of old clothes and straw.

They are caught in a murderous cross-fire between guerrillas hidden

along both sides of the road.

Most are killed but one lives long

enough to tell what happened.

A few days later another truck of troops sees a "corpse" lying

in the middle of the highway.

The driver has been forewarned so he

knows better than to stop. Instead he steps on the gas, runs over

the dummy as he speeds on around the next curve in the road-- perhaps

into a hidden land-mine. Or perhaps into a chain stretched between

two trees. Or perhaps onto a part of the highway that has been

covered with fresh oil which sends the truck skidding over an embank-

ment.

What will the next truck full of troops do? What can you figure

out so you will

still be thinking one step ahead of the enemy?

9. Generally speaking the guerrilla band must avoid superior

forces. When attacked by a

superior force the guerrillas must quickly

retreat of disperse. When the enemy stops, they may return to harass

him-- or perhaps they won't.

When

the enemy is exhausted they may

attack-- but again they may not. When the enemy retreats the guerrillas

may give chase-- but only if they can be very sure they are not being

led into a trap.

10. Guerrillas must always fight at a time and place of their own

choosing-- never at a time or place of the enemy's choosing.

* 11. Before any raid on enemy troops or installations the guerrilla

leader must obtain complete and

accurate intelligence on the number of

the enemy on hand,

the number near enough to be called on for assistance,

amount and type of enemy armament, location of sentries, scouts or

protective patrols and all other information that will effect the plan-

ning or conduct of the raid.

12. All raids against the enemy must be exactly planned and cara-

fully rchearsed. It is often desirable to draw a miniature copy of the

enemy installation so thot all members of the raiding party can play

out their respaciive duties several times to make sure they do rot

forget

or become confused in the heat of battle.

13. Everything that could pussibly go wrons must be auticipated

id alcernare plans made to cope wirh any eventualily.

14. Guerrillas should strike a violent lightning blow that leaves

the enemy stunned at least long enough for them to make a safe retreat.

15. In no case must tha guerrilias allow themselves to be drawn

into a long pitched battle with enemy troops.

16. So long as friendly forces of the conventional military

are able to retain their offensive potential it is expedient for

guerrilla forces to coordinate their activities with such friendly

troops.

17. Guerrilla bands must always nove in secret - their whereabouts

must always be hidden from the civilian population as well as from

enemy troops.

• 18. When possible always attack the enemy at places which are

distant from centers of population as this will reduce the possibility

of his making reprisals against friendly civilians.

19. If a lone enemy soldier is way-laid in the city or suburbs it

is best to carry his body. away where it can be buried and the grave

camouflaged so his commander will not know whether he has been killed

or has deserted.

Take his uniform and hide it carefully where it can

be later retrieved. It might come in handy.

20. The guerrillas must always operate in their home territory

where they have intimate knowledge of their surroundings. If driven

from their own territory by a superior enemy force they should return

as soon as they safely can, provided that their main hide-out has not

been discovered and there is no chance of an enemy ambush.

21. Guerrillas must make every effort to stay friendly with any

civilian population in their territory as the civilians may be their

best source of food, other supplies, or valuable information about

nearby enemy forces.

22. It is almost essential that the guerrilla band have at least

one secure hide-out where they can rest up, store their supplies and

care for their wounded. This hide-out may be in some large forest or

mountainous area but such is not always necessary. During World War II

one Russian guerrilla band had their headquarters in a storm sewer.

Another band headquartered in the basement of a hospital in one of the

smaller towns. Another operated from an abandoned coal mine.

23. The guerrilla band should have one or more alternate hide-outs

and be ready to move quickly and quietly to another prepared location

in case their main headquarters is discovered. To preserve maximum

security the location of these alternate hide-outs should be known to

the least possible number af their own band.

24. To operate successfully over long periods of time the

guerrilla band must have plenty oi space in which to manuever--

preferably a large enough area that the enemy is incapable of

covering all of it with anti-guerrilla forces at one time.

• 25. Guer

la activity is most suilably

ducted in muuntains,

swamp and other types of terrain that are inaccessible to tanks,

large guns and mechanized forcas but with proper strategy at least

some guerrilla activity can be suited to almost any type area-- even

large cities. Furthermore, due to the widespread use of light weight

weapons such as the bazooka and recoilless rifle it must be expected

that mountains will provide somawhat less protection to guerrillas

in future war's than they have in

the past.

Therefore it is essential

that underground activity be diracted against the enemy under every

possible condition and

over the widest possible area so as to prevent

his concentrating nis forces for a complete "nop-up" operation in

any one district.

26. Guerrilla furces cannot ordinarily affosd to take prisoners.

If you are lucky enough, to capture a high-ranking officei or party

official he may ba held for ransom or as a hostage to guarantee against

extreme brutality by the enemy or reprisals by the enemy against the

civilian population. With extreme caution he may be traded for

guerrillas held prisoner by the enemy.

Most .commonly any captured enemy must be shot. If prisoners are

taken they must ba kept in chains and closely guarded day and night.

If one were to escape he would certainly lead

the enemy back to your

hideout.

27. Due to their superior forces, the enemy may make several

mistakes and still fight effectively.

For the guerrilla band a single

mistake may lead to complete annihilation. Therefore every activity

must be conducted with extreme caution and complete secrecy.

28. Guerrillas must be extremely tidy housekeepers. Garbage .

thrown out around camp may actract birds which in turn may alert the

enemy. A tin can, carelessly tossed aside may catch the sun just

right to be seen by a scouting airplane.. While on the march a broken

branch or a thoughtlessly dropped match

cover may give your presence

away to the enemy who could radio ahead to set up an ambush.

29.. Each member of the band must be constantly alert that his

own action does nor give away the guerrilla position to the enemy.

In remote areas the smeli of smoke may carry for many miles. Even

cigarette smoke can give away the sentries position to a quiatly

can be seen for 300 yards. With a good pair of binoculars it can

be seen for a mile.

#it

30. A single careless ot obscinate member must not be allowed to

endanger the lives of the ocher menders of the band.

31. Guerrilla forces caunt afford defeat and are poorly

equipped to care for casualties, Therafore, action against the

enemy must be taken only urder such conditions as insure maximum

opportunity for succuss.

32. Before any actloil is lalien against the enemy one or wort

clear paths of retreat must ho assured.

of their own lives. This is essentiai both for the morale of the

band but to make cortain the fallen guerrilla is not tortured inco

revealing the identity of his friends and the location of their

camp.

35. Guerrilla forces selcom attempt to occupy territory in tae.

usual sense. Instead they seak to dominate the territory by con-

tinuous raids, ambushes and harassnent of enemy troops to such an

extent that continued

occupation by enemy forces is no lorger worth

the price they must pay.

36. Success in guarrilla warfare dapends largely on superior

mobility.

Transport and movement are therefore of great importance to the

guerrilla band. So long as the civilian population is allowed to use

their automobiles the guecrillas can (wich forged identity cards)

do likewise.

If the civilion population is rigidly controllad oc

largely enslaved then the guerrillas must depend on other methods of

transportation.

Bands that must nove on foot are limited in the distance over which

they can operate.

Possible targets for sabotage must be within two

or three nights narch. Even then the guarcillas are apt to be badly

fatigued before they go into action and they will have trouble getting

away without being discovered,

Suppose that a guerrilla scout reports that a poorly zuarded

supply column is camped 30 miles away.

The guerrilla band may nead

these supplies desperately buc if they must travel by for the enemy

will likely have moved on before they can get.thare. These are

serious problens for which aaci band musi find solutions depending

on their own conditions and terricory.

37. Close cooperation beiween different bands is seldom required

and

may be undesirable. Increfora it is

more important that cormini

•cation between bands be secure than chot it ba fast.

38. Each guerrilla band is sesponsible for its own actions aod

bears the pain of its on miciakes without drawing other bands irso

any calamity that may befali it.

39. When anti-guurrilla accivity becomes very intense, larg-

bands should disperse inco a mmber oi small bands thac can tido

easier, move taster and and iller through enemy lines will: less

41. Hit-or-miss sabotage is not nearly as effective as coordin-

ated sabotage that strikes systematically at some few essential

industries of activities vital to the enemy at that particular time.

42. Targets for raids and sabotage must be carefully selected to

achieve maximum damage to the enemy with least risk to the guerrilla

band. If the enemy has an abundance of guns but is low on ammunition

then burning a warehousa full of guns will not count for much whereas

burning a warehouse full of ammunition would be a vital blow.

43. Each military action against the enemy must be planned in such

a manner that the amount of ammunition and supplies captured are at

least enough to replenish the amount

expended in that action.

44. Both offensive and defensive guerrilla activity is vitally

dependent upon accurate knowledge of the enemy's strength, location,

movements and so far as possible his intentions which is usually

best obtained first hand by guerrilla scouts.

45.

In the evant that troops have settled down in the guecrilla

area for a long and routine occupation, efforts should be made to

determine whether or not they are completely loyal to the foreign

Ideology before antagonizing a possible potential ally.

46. The guerrilla must be continuously imagining himself in the

shoes of his enemy. He must get to know how the enemy is likely to

react in any given situation.

He must be able to guess what the

enemy commander will expect his band to do next. In this way he can

often anticipate what the enemy will do. By then acting in some

totally unexpected manner he can continuously catch the enemy in a

series of embarrassing situations.

47. Guerrilla forces must remain widely dispersed throughout the

entire area of enemy occupation. They must never accumulate in large

numbers in a given area that the enemy can surround and eventually

starve them out or gradually close in on them.

48. Guerrilla forces must be always alert to possible anti-

guerrilla action. that may be taken against them and constantly

prepared to take suitable evasive action.

49. The guerrilla bands most essential function is to guarantee

its own continuation. The very existence of the guerrilla band

requires the enemy to guard against then and in so doing they are

drained of manpower, supplies and equipment which the enemy forces

might be needing badly in some other area.

50. Clear-cut victory is seldom possible either with or against

guerrilla warfare-- the side that holds out longest will be the

ultimate winner.

Twist soft cotten string into three strands. Moisten black powder to form a paste and rub the

paste into the twisted string. Burns 30 to 40 inches per minute.

SLOW BURNING FUSE

Dissolve one part of Potassium Nitrate or Potassium Chlorate and one part of sugar (granulated)

in two parts of hot water.

Soak the string in this solution. Twist the string into three strands and

allow to dry. Birns about 2 inches per minute.

FUSES

Fuses can be made by soaking course paper in a solution of gun powder and acutone (nail polish re-

a sticky substance, then dipping into gunpowder, coating all surfaces. A time delay fuse that can

be used without a match is made as follows: Make a small pile of potassium permanganate and make

a small pile of it on the ground, making a hole in the center of it. Next pour in the hole. about an

equal amount of straight glycerine. A flash will occur in about one minute. This method is best

used when gun powder has to be used as a fuse... or for starting fires.

JELLIED GASOLINE

Pour the contents of one bottle (1 pint 3 0%. ) of Dynamo concentrated liquid laundry detergent into a

bucket or large mouthed can of about two to five gallon sive.

Fill the detergent bottle twice; shaking

well to rinse it out with gasoline (any grade) and ace it to the detergent. You will now have about

3 1/2 pints (57 oz) of material in the bucket. The detergent will be at the bottomandthe gasoline on

the top. Stir this rapidly with a wooden or wire paddle so as to mix in as much air as possible. Soun

the mixture will take on the appearance of soft vasoline.

Now add in a gallon of gasoline and stir again until the mixture thickens. At this point, transfer the

mixture to clean containers. No return type beer and soda bottles are ideal. For chemical land

mines, use two gallon oil cans. The container should be tilled approximately one third full of the

mixture.

Finish filling the container with gasoline leaving a little air space at the top. Place your

finger or hand over the opening and shake well until the gasoline and mixture amalgamate. You can

verify this by looking at the finger or hand occasionally to see if a film of jellied gasoline about an

eighth of an inch thick clings to it. When proper consistency is reached, the bottles may be capped or

corked. Cans should have tight fitting lids screwed on. This may be stored up to two weeks. Tie

a rag around the neck of each bottle being careful not to leave the ends of the rag too long or too loose.

If necessary, this mixture can be "cut" 50! with gasoline or other petroleum product. The tendency

to "cling" will suffer slightly, but consistency can he maintained by pouring off the excess gasoline

whenever the detergert refuses to "take" any more.

To use, saturate the rag with gasoline or the mixture from the bottle. Keep the flamable material

off of your person and clothing. Light the rag with match or cigarette lighter and immediately serve.

Throw hard against a solid object such as masonry, concrete, or metal.

In using the mixture in

a chemical land mine, wrap three or four wraps of pri macord around a two gallon can and tie the prim-

acord under the can around a pound of explosive. This may be exploded either electricaily or by a per-

cussion such as a booby trap device or anti-personell fuse. Do not contact wires to the blasting

machine until after you have carefully removed all traces of your work and camouflaged the position.

Never us any plastic article in contact with the above misture.

We granted the interview with the newspaper women I wrote you about.

It should be

out in a week or so, will send you a copy when its printed. We really put on a show for

this girl, the secret contact, meeting place, radio communications, etc. The whole secret

agent bit. During the interview she told us that the police had been out to see her after the

first article. The San Diego Police wanted to know who she had talked too (we mailed the

information for the first story to her). Later she had a visit from the feds asking her if

she would infiltiate our organization for them. They must be getting hard up for information

when they have to go out and try to recruit people. This girl might be alright, but we are

not going to trust her anyway. Its getting where I can count the people I trust on one hand

and still have four fingers left.

Enclosed are three more letters for you, two wrong addresses, and one hate letter.

Just so you will not think that you are the only one who gets these letters, I have enclosed

one we received a few days ago. If the literture we send out gets these types (religous

nuts and love creeps) so upset, then we must be on the right track.

Sorry about the delay in mailing you the May Bulletins, we just did not have

the funds to pay for the printing until now. If nothing go's wrong we will be able

to print-up the Security Training Program and your Mail Drop Transfer Letter

this coming weekend. Hope to have the funds available for the Special Bulletin

the following weekend.

I have enclosed a copy of the first part of the newspaper interview we gave.

Will send you the other articles as they are printed. The way we understand it

is that it will be a three piece article,

The first one is not to bad. We have

been receiving articles from other papers in the area too, but they have all been

of the smear type.

On the subject of bulletins; when would you be able to write another one, and

What subject would you be covering. Also would like for you to write the foremai

(one or two pages) for some of the bulletins. We have been trying to keep the

bulletins between 10 to 12 pages long.. The only original bulletin we have put-out

so far as the one you wrote on lock picking. I am fairly good at stealing material

and rewriting it, but have trouble writing anything orginal.

Would like to set-up another meeting with you in the near future. There are

some things we need to talk over with you that we cannot put in a letter. Let me

know when you will have some time off and we will try to make some arrangements.

The shit hit the fan here this week again. We put out a Special Bulletin containing

information about some of the San Diego City officials. The fuzz was out to see me two

days after ive mailed it out. They told me that the city had assigned two detectives on

full time duty to keep an eye on SAO activities. The left fired bombed one of their own

cars and tryed to blame it own us, plus one of the city councilmen received a threating

phone call. The detectives told me that one high ranking left winger had call the police

and demanded they assign him policemen to protect him.

• We have been making some real good headway in setting up new groups in California.

Some of the new people we are getting are working out real well, others are the hanger-on

types. We are having a little trouble with some DePugh types up in Los Angeles.

They

don't like the idea of us organizing up there. If they start any trouble we will give them

more than they are looking fox, you can bet on that.

We should have the May Underground Bulletin ready to mail out to you by the first of

the month.

We are reprinting the Communications Bulletin. Rewrote it to fit our group.

If we have the money I will try to print up both of the letters at the same time.

Sorry to here about you being out of work again, no how it is trying to make ends meet.

I can only draw eight unemployment checks then I will have to go back to work. Sure wish

some fat cat would finance a few of us to work full time on organization activities. Guess

there is no danger of that thou.

When are you going to be able to have the bulletin that you are

writing ready? Is it going to be ready to sent to the printer when you

let us have it, or are we going to have to retype it and do the lay out

work? If you can have it ready to go right to the printer it will be

& big help.

We also need to know hot many pages it is going to run. If

Its not at loast Il pages long we are going to need time to write up some

additional material to fill out the bulletin.. Some where between ID to

Il pages would be ideal.

• If you do not have enough material on locks to fill out that many

pages fill free to use any other material that deals with underground

warfare.

You have copies of our other bulletins so you know the many

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

SPECIAL BULLETIN

As most of the citizens of San Diego County are no doubt aware many liberals, pinks,

reds, and other fuzzy thinking types will be bringing themselves and there gas masks here

in August for a "peaceful" protest during the Republican National Convention.

While local left-wing groups are preparing for the "peaceful" protest by stock piling

gas masks, flak vests, firearms and ammunition the city of San Diego is rolling out the

red carpet (aptly named) for these profession revolutionaries. Yes, as strange as it

may seem some members of the San Diego City government are going out of their way to

make sure these communist revolutionaries are made welcome here.

Mavourneen O'Connor, twin sister of City Councilwomen MAUREEN O'CONNOR

(Home address: 5821 Lauretta, San Diego, Telephone: 295-8693), is one of the more

prominent members of the community who is engaged in this strange behavior. Miss

O'Connor is employed by the Southern California First National Bank as a Community

Relations officer, taking time off last year to run the campaign of her sister Maureen.

Her new duties are setting up a central headquarters for the protestors to use during

the convention. The Unconventional Center (also aptly named) is to be this headquarters.

Located at the corner of Jefferson and Riley Streets just six blocks from the Sports Arena

the site of the convention, the 7, 800 foot warehouse is being stocked with the expected

services that may be needed by the protestors. These include; transportation, facilities

for the printing of propaganda, a telephone message center, legal aid services, and a

medical aid center.

These last two are odd, considering its to be a "peaceful" protest.

The bill for all this is being picked up by the Southern California First National

Bank who's chairman is ROBERT OSCAR PETERSON (Home address: 567 Gage Lane,

San Diego, Telephone: 222-4835). Mr. Peterson has not always been a supporter of

these left-wing type activities, in fact as late as January 1970 he was on the recciving.

end of a smear article done by the San Diego STREET JOURNAL. The Street Journal

for those citizens lucky cnough not to have seen an issue is one of many pro-communist

underground newspapers that operate in the San Diego area.

The article on Peterson exposed his business dealings with a number of large com-

panies; Foodmaker Corporation (owners of Jack In The Box drive-ins), and the Ralston

Purina Corporation among others.

At the end of the article the Street Journal made the

Nw 550atutumand thadsosainagertiate would expose other of his business dealings.

---

## Page 388

Needless to say, the article never appeared. One can only wonder now that Mr.

Peterson is supporting these same type of penple if some kind of blackmail was not used.

Many of the members of the staff of the Street Journal live at a commune supported by

the paper at 173 4th Avenue in Chula Vista.

The first news conference of the Unconventional Center was attended by these noted

prominent city officials: Councilmen Gil Johnson and Jim Bates, and city manager Kimball

Moore. Others not quite so prominent attending were a long haired representative from

the Community Congress and Shari Whitehead, 24, a representative from the Convention

Coalition. The Convention Coalition is the group that plans to coordinate the activities of

protestors expected to arrive for the convention. While Mayor Wilson was not able to

attend this meeting in person he later made this comment on Mavourneen O'Connor's pro-

demonstration activities " I commend her for her energy and her efforts ".

Of all the organizations preparing to protest at the convention the Convention Coal-

ition is probably the most active. Some of the leaders of the coalition are; Peter Bohmer,

the off again, on again, economics professor at San Diego State, seen recently at 4931

Coronado Street, San Dicgo: Michael Kenneth, address 3777 Fairmont, San Diego; Pam

Williams, also seen at the Coronado Street address: and last, but not least, Doug Porter,

recently seen at 2445 Albatross, San Diego. Headquarters for the coalition are at 309

6th Street in San Diego.

While the Intelligence Branch of the San Diego Police Department has reported to

city officials the militant activities (stock piling weapons and explosives) of these leftest

groups the city fathers have annoy all warnings:

Instead of spending every dime the

city can spare on weapons and equipment to help the police put down a possible riot the

powers to be believe the money can better be spent for SENSITIVITY TRAINING.

While the left is planing a full scale' battle the public officials of San Diego spend the

tax payers money on sensitivity training for the police department. And guess who they

pick to teach this garbage, a foreign born (Iran) Professor of Psychology who was kicked

off the staff at San Diego State because of his profanity and teaching of left-wing views.

JAUAD EMAMI was a Assistant Professor at SDS before having been removed, he and

his wife Minou live at 3850 American Avenue in La Mesa. The 5'10", 190 pound, black

hair, brown eye professor was educated at UCLA and the University of Arizona.

• Emami

drives a white van (California ZM.J 181) and is payed $25 an hour to teach our policemen

, talk nice to these creeps that will be invading San Diego in August.

• Instead of hiring this fuzky headed professor the S4O believes the City of San Diego

should have hired Lieutenant Cally, then at least the police would have received some

expert training on how to handled RED TRAITORS.

Dear Fellow American,

At the request of a mutual friend we are sending you this invitation to

join the Secret Army Organization.. Those of us who have been members for

some time sincerely believe that our organization can be of real value in pre-

serving for future generations the land of freedom and opportunity which our

forefathers handed down to us.

It is the belief of our organization that the communist-socialist con-

spiracy has infiltrated the United States Government to such an extent that the

American people cannot rely on this country's elected leaders to protect them

from communist domination and slavery.

We believe that the time will come when the American people will have

to fight for their lives and their liberty. In this belief, we have formed in

advance a secret underground army with but one objective, to defend our con-

stitutional republic and to help our fellow Americans to do the same.

We do no want lukewarm members. We are an organization of people

willing to make any sacrifice necessary for our country. If you feel the same

way, we invite you to join us.

History on

the Secret Army Organization

Oue early morning in February, 1970, a group of six Minutemen leaders from

four states met secretly in Northern Arizona to discuss the crisis that the arrest and

imprisonment of two top Minutemen leaders and the assassination of a third had

brought on the organization. Although some of these men had met before in their roles

as Minutemen group leaders, others were meeting for the first time.

After much discussion, two principal points were agreed upon. First, that the

Minutemen as a national coordination organization of militant right-wing groups had

effectively been destroyed by the pro-communist eiements inside the Justice Depart-

ment. While individual units still existed throughout the country, few had the financial

support or leadership to be really effective. Second, that the need for such a coordi-

nating organization wasgreater than ever in view of the increased revolutionary. activity

by communists in the United States.

With these two points in mind, suggestions were put forward on a course of

action to be followed. After a meeting that lasted all that day and far into the next

morning, an overall plan of action was finally agreed upon. All present agreed to

merge their individual units together and form a new organization under the command

of one leader elected from among themselves, with the other five to be members of a

General Staff that would advise and assist the new leader.

While retaining the basic programs and policies of the Minutemen, it was

decided that not only should this new organization have a different name, but also a

completely new chain of command and organizational structure. If the new organiza-

going to survive the attacks that befell the old one, a whole new approach

would be needed. Never again could the arrest or death of a few leaders be allowed to

cripple the entire organization.

For this reason it was decided that only a highly disciplined military type

orgainization with a definite chain of command would have any chance of success. This

then, was the beginning of the Secret Army Organization. Beginning with an original

force of hard core patriots that numbered fewer than two hundred, the Secret Army

Organization began the job of picking up the pieces and continuing to fight for national

and individual freedom.

Using this cadre of dedicated personnel as a nucleus, the

S. A. O. has been recruiting and training new members in the skills they will need as

the freedoin fighters of tomorrow.

The leaders of the S. A. O. have no idea of fighting a last ditch stand. We have

no desire to commit suicide ourselves or to let our members do so. We have a

strategy which we believe will ultimately lead to victory. Only one thing is essential.

We must start preparing and training NOW! We of the S. A. O. believe that our country

is worthy of any sacrifice. I you feel the same way, we invite you to join us.

To Prospective Members Of The .

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

The Secret Army Organization is the most active, most completely dedicated and

most selective in its membership of all the many patriotic organizations in America.

We are willing to make any sacrifice for our country and we fully expect that some of

us will have to make the ultimate sacrifice before victory is achieved. Our very lives

depend on each other. There is no place in this organization for bunglers, playboys or

lukewarm conservatives. If you join the Secret Army Organization, there might easily

come a time that your life would depend on how competently some other member had

• learned his job.

Unless you are especially well informed

on the domestic and world political

situation, it is probable that you have a lot to learn about the present threat our nation

faces. Unless you have had many years experience in actual underground warfare,

there is undoubtedly a lot you can learn from the experts in our organization who have

developed and supervised our training program.

OUR NATION IS IN IMMEDIATE DANGER

It is possible that within a very few years, perhaps even within months, our

nation could be conquered and enslaved by the communists. To prevent this we must

know as much as possible about our enemies. Unless we know who they are and what

they are doing we will not succeed in our efforts to maintain a free America.

THE RESISTANCE MOVEMENT

In driving an invader from your land the resistance involved goes through three

stages of development.

1) The Underground Network

2) Active Guerrilla Warfare

• 3) Open or Conventional Warfare

The conventional warfare stage uses everything in the way of weapons that the

enemy does but must also have active guerrillas andunderground agents working against

the enemy, too. In the present state of military tactics conventional warfare cannot

succeed unless

these other two ingredients are used simultaneously.

The first step is to form an underground network. An active guerrilla system

must have the support of an underground network of approximately three times its own

size. This underground must supply the active guerrilla fighter with supplies, con-

cealment, information, etc. An underground network starts with departments of

intelligence, security and propaganda in that order.

Sabotage, espionage, subversion, infiltration, escape and evasion, training,

clandestine fabrication of supplies, counterfeiting enemy documents, recruiting, com-

munications and propaganda are other phases of underground activity. Each member

of the Secret Army Organization, to be effective, must have a working knowledge of

all these tactics as well as the military tactics more commonly associated with guerril-

ASSIGNMENT TO UNITS

Many people that inquire about membership in the Secret Army Organization

seem to have an idea that they will be immediately accepted into an active unit.

Look at it this way. Suppose you had spent a year or more carefully recruiting and

training until you had a hard hitting team where every individual was reliable, dedi-

cated, and had confidence in his fellow unit members. Wouldn't it make you mad to

have the national or regional organization assign some rank amateur to your unit

that you you knew little or nothing about?

Before any new member is assignedto an active unit or to an important under-

ground project, he mist undergo a period of training. During this training he will be

directed through the mails by an experienced member and some of his activities may

be observed by other members without his knowledge. Only when a new member

proves himself to be conscientious, trustworthy, self-disciplined and able to operate

effectively alone will he be accepted as a "'secure member" and invited to participate

with other unit members in a teamwork operation.

EXPENSES.

Unfortunately, most good things don't come cheap. Although we make every

effort to keep down the expense of membership in the Secret Army Organization, you

must expect to pay your own way.

Dues to the Secret Army Organization are $3. 00 per month. This money is

absolutely necessary for use to maintain our central files and headquarters, for

postage and printing, to finance our extensive intelligence network, and to maintain

training areas.

Each member will have other expenses depending on the type of activity he is

engaged in. Every member will be expected to buy his own gun, amnunition and

other basic combat equipment. During training the new member may be expected to

buy certain books or subscribe to certain magazines that his work requires. During

this time the new member will also be suppliedwith reading material on the strategy

and tactics of guerrilla warfare. Tois home work will make it possible for him to

fit in quickly to an active unit and participate effectively in actual maneuvers,

marksmanship training, etc.

Following this preliminary training a member may be either assigned to an

existing unit, assisted in organizing his own unit if he has shown sufficient leadership

qualities or become part of an underground network.

Upon your acceptance into the Secret Army Organization you will be given a

definite scries of projects described inwriting so you will know exactly what will be

expected of you.

We hope that you can succeed in this effort because your country desperately

needs patriots at this time.

Baltimore has a separate case

The most current information supplied by BAT-Zin

to lose popularity in the Maryland area. This loss of popu-

larity and support can be attributed to constant accusations

that STEVENS is an informant.

Statements made by ROBERT DE PUGH

concerning STEVENS' character have also considerably weakened

his support since the writing of enclosed report.

Contacts with the following sources who are familiar

with White Extremist activities in Maryland, and specifically,

Minutemen operations conducted by STEVENS, failed to indicate

that STEVENS has formed an alliance with SAO. Sources indicate

NIXON

DESCRIPTION

FULL NAME: Richard Milhous Nixon. DATE OF BIRTH: January 9, 1913 at Yorba Linda,

California. FORMER OCCUPATIONS: Used car salesman, law clerk, second rate congress-

man, and mediocre Vice President. PRESENT OCCUPATION: Professional liar and double

crosser (part time employment as United States President). WEIGHT: 170 pounds. EYES:

brown. HAIR: black. HEIGHT: 5'11". ' RACE: White. NATIONALITY: Claims American

citizenship but actions prove this unlikely. LAST KNOWN ADDRESS: 1600 Pennsylvania

Avenue, Washington, D.C. (Rumored to have a California hideout. )

CRIMINAL RECORD

RICHARD NIXON (alias Cry-Baby Nixon, alieas Tricky Dicky) is an expert in disguises and

has successfully passed himself off as an anti-communist in the past. He may again try using

this disguise if pressed for votes in 1972. Saying one thing, then doing the opposite is Nixon's

MOA. While he campaigned in 1968 on a platform of curtailing socialism he has in fact done

more to establish a socialistic dictatorship than either of the last two Democrat administra-

tions. His economic policies have continued to enrich Big Industrialists while rising prices

and higher taxes have all but reduced the average worker to a state of financial slavery. This

criminal has even made vicious, attacks on small children (forced b using to acheive "racial

balance") and has caused the destruction of local school systems. WARNING: Nixon suffers

from an EMPEROR COMPLEX and becomes extremely dangerous when criticized.

CAUTION

Trickery and deceit are Nixon's trade-marks. At the present time Nixon and his chief hench-

man HENRY (CZAR) KISSINGER are engaged in forming an alliance with another gang of

criminals, the Red Chinese. The RED CHINA GANG have slaughtered an estimated fifty

million of their own people since coming to power. This Godless horde of barbarians killed

thousands of Americans in the Korean War (shooting captured soldiers and starving and tor-

turing prisoners of war). The RED CHINA GANG have been supplying the NORTH VIETNAM-

ESE BANDITS with weapons and bullets to kill American soldiers in another no-win war in

Vietnam. The very fact that Nixon is dealing with these ARCH ENEMIES OF FREEDOM iS

enough to convict him of treason. DO NOT LET THIS CRIMINAL STEAL YOUR FREEDOV.

DEMAND HIS ARREST BY PROPER AUTHORITIES AND HIS TRIAL FOR THE CRIME OF /5^- 2815

HIGH TREASON.

Dear Mr. Belmont:

Since reading about the FBI files and records being stolen by

Radicals, I Implore you to either destroy my last lotter about

the secret Army Organization or send it back to me, and not to keep

it in your regular files,

- II this 1s what 1s done with all

correspondence. Also, it's hard to say who will be the next director

of the FBly or

whether he, or the people he appoints will be able to

be trusted--as. I. Edgar Hoovor and his mon. There will never be

a main as good or competent as t.

Edgar. Hoover.

And I foar for the

safety of our Country, 1f and when he retires! (I do not trust Nixon,

I don't oven respett him, and he 1s: not, what many people used to

think he was:h.)

If the SAO, are truly dedicated Counter-Revolutlonary's, then they

are your only hopo, and mine, and 1t would seem that every loyal

Polico Officer and

the battle with us, shoubd we be taken over-or Civil War break out.

Therofore, it would be In your best interests to either destroy

the lotter I gent inquiring about the sao, (after talking to Nancy

Bira, of the Sheriff's Dept. Deputy Bird) I feel more confident, that

they are all I hoped they would bes and also, out to help the Police

and to protect thel.

Becauso of Govt' interference I'm sure the SAO wouldn't have wanted

me writing to you, not because they don't trust fBI agents or

J.Edgar Hoover (I'm sure) but because they know there are Red's high

up In the Bort.

and they don't trust ANY Attorney General's anymore,

for which I don't blame them!! (Any Attorney General who would quit

to try to get Nixon elected,

has to be very left of center--to put it

mildly! E-cept for J. Edgar Hoover and you FBI agents, and the

Conservatives-Hashington D.C. is rotton to the coro!!!!

I would never betray the SAO, and I guoss I shouldn't havo written to

you about them, In case the fbI records got into the WRoNG HaNDS, but

I just wanted to find out your professional opinion on them, and

find out, 1f I actually walked into a Rod trap.

I sincorely hope you can indood, have my previous lotter in regard

to the SAO destroyed. If 1t evor got Into enemy hands, which 1t

surely would 1I a loftiat vero to be appointod as director of the FBI,

I would be assasinated, and perhaps. my children killed too.

Much to my shock the reds already know about the SAl, (but HOW, I don't

know, as they maintain the utmost in secrecy and securityo) and 1f

the Communists: hate them, (or us) as much as they say they do, they

they. must be wonderful people!

• If the SAO are true patriots, with high principles and standards, and 11

they have faith in God to doliver us from our brutal deadly enemies,

then I would do all I could to holp them--within tho Law.

The only reason I revealed all this information to you, and to my

friends: in the San Diego County Sheriff's Dopto, 1s becauso, 13: I said

to Sgt. Paul Franklin, I know I can trust you, and we are on the same

s1de. I never would have given this information

to the Sherifl's Dopt,

If I didn't know him, and many of his men personally, and in fact I

worked on his campaign to elect him Sheriff, as did many a John

Birch Society momber, who knew for sure he was a lojal American, and

&i Ian fOX LAW AND ORDER, and an Anti-Communisty By him, I mean

Sheriff John Duffy.)

I askod Sgt. Franklin, to keop the SAO matorial out of the regular

S1105. All we can do 1S HOPE, that tho Shoriff's Dopt., and other

Law Enforcoment agencios aron't Infiltrated with Rods!

She was informed that the FBI could not furnish her

any information concerning the SAy or advise her as to whether

on the SAZor SAD. "

She thereafter wrote a letter to SAo and

she received some literature on the history of SAo and also

received an application for membership in SAO, which she filled

She stated since making application with SAO she

has realized that this organization condones violence, which she

does not.

However, she plans to remain in the organization, for

the time being at least, for the sole purpose of obtaining infor-

They have sent me literature on electronic surveillance, counter

at onco verified that they were on the sido of the Police and FbI.

After I sent the application in,

the thought dawned on me, that maybe

It's a trapo haybe they are infiltrated, how do I know?

Mr. Belmont,.

we no longer have any federal protection, because of the permissive

courts, and traitorous juages, and now, no death penalty even.

What are those of us, who insist on Ilving In freedom, the "Pursuit

of Life, Liberty, and the Pursult of Happiness"--supposed to do?

Are we supposed to sit back and wait for the seeming inevitable

death warrant for those of us who have sworn to resist a takeover to

our last breath? We, the people, are being strangled,

in a pincers

strategy--the big Communists and their sympathizers at the very top

of our Government, and the Ilttle ones at the bottom--the Revolutionaries!!

In the name of Heaven, why doesn't SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING!! •

WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IO YOU FBI AGENTS???? To the POLICE?

Really now, can any tre red-blooded American blame those of us, who

want to join an orrective counter-revolutionary Army--sinco our

armed forces are so mutinous and infiltrated? The Polico can no

longer protect us, because they have been rendered helpless and useless

by the courts. The Réds in the supreme court have destroyed America.

I don't intend to break any laws--but some laws were made by Communist

Sympathizers.

Those of us who have the Spirit of 76 in us, simply

something like this.

Right? I don't seo what choice you will have.

middle road! With the Pro-Conmunist feeling now being fostered by

cortain traitors In our Govt. and ALI the main news media--what choice ¿

we have--but to join an organization that trains us to fight the enemy,

with the resolve to overthrow him. The true Americans will be HATED

with a Satanic passion--because of this massive brainwashing of the

goneral public going on right now This masochistic mania to embrace

b1oody Red China--is the ultimate of Insanity and criminality!!!!

It seems like an unreal, hollish nightmare to so many of us.

On February 9, 1971

By JEROME

I contacted the mystery man last night at

Denny's Restaurant and it turned out to be ISAAC CANTRELL.

He told me that he previously lived in Arizona and

because of some trouble or difficulty there, moved

to

Los Angeles, California.

He said he believed he had been followed to

Los Angeles.

He subsequently moved to the San Diego area

and is now living in Alpine.

We talked about his recent arrest on charges

of violating firearms laws and he said the charges

against him have been dismissed. He said he thinks

the local authorities are still watching him, and that

they may try to arrest him again if they get the chance.

He said he still has most of his stuff for

working on firearms but indicated that the articles which

were confiscated at the time of his arrest had not been

returned to him.

As an additional note of interest, he told me

he had been in contact with BOB DE PUGH and WALTER PEYSON

at Phoenix, Arizona, approximately three months before

they were arrested.

I plan to proceed slowly in my contacts with

CANTRELL as he. may be a set-up for the local or state

authorities.

By JEROME

The photograph of RONALD TIMOTHY DOMENICK

is not familiar to me.

However, I will scout around

and see if I can find out something about him.

I was talking to SAM DAVIS yesterday. He told

me he recently came close to killing a police officer

and explained that he and GEORGE HOOVER were hauling a

trunk full of machine guns in one of their cars when

they were stopped because they had a bad headlight.

DAVIS said he got out to mee the officer ano

and had a .45 calioes pistol under his belt on his back

and a nana grenade in each pocket of his jacket. He

said HOOVER, who stayed in the car, was covering him with

a Thompson sub-machine gun. He said if the officer had

tried to look in the car they probably would have had

to kill him.

CANTRELL and I have set up a method whereby

there will be a five minute period of time each week

during which I can contact him at a specified telephone

number.

Attached are some printed materials from the

National Center foi the Exploration of Human Potential.

These items were obtained a while ago by the ilinutement

from the files of the Message Information Center.

EXPERIENCING COMMUNITY

THE TORI EXPERIENCE

The TORI community starts with several

experiences designed to build a sense of com-

munity, and to deepen personal growth.

Stemming from these experiences, the

community unfolds and emerges. Each mem-

ber has an opportunity to participate in this

process and to influence the unfolding' in

significant ways. The community becomes

, a powerful medium for personal change.

Members Have an opportunity to relate in-

tensely and openly to many others in a variety

of situatiorr.. They are free to try out new

ways of bi.hd and doing. Each participant

is responsilie for his own learning, and has

a variety of options and choices during the

weekend. Each person, in a significant sense,

creates his own experience and his own com-

munity environment.

The TOR! experiences (trust, openness,

realization, and interdependence) emerge

from the community interaction. They are

seen as central to the growth of the person

as well as to the development of community.

The basic TORI theory will be presented by

Dr. Jack R. Gibb as it is applied to the build-

ing of a sense of community in classrooms,

neighborhoods, congregations, families, and

the total school or business system.

Sandra La Boon, who will be conducting

the workshop, has worked with Dr. Gibb over

the past two years in a wide variety of group

NW 55009 DocId: 32989524 •Page 426

experiences. She has conducted groups with

the Center, Y.M.C.A.'s of Los Angeles and

San Diego and with the Methodist Church.

She is currently conducting research with Dr.

Gibb on the TORi theory.

DESIGN

The community is built upon 24 hours of

experiences over a three-day period. Parti-

cipants should plan to attend for all 24 hours.

No observers will be admitted although parti-

cipants will have freedom to participate in an

experience or not. We start after dinner, 7:30

PM on Friday. The Experience ends 5:00 PM

on Sunday. It is not necessary to stay over

night at the Inn.

CLOTHING

The dress should be comfortable and in-

formal, so you can sit on the floor and go

barefooted or wear socks.

SCHEDULE

Friday night from 7:30 p.m. - 11:00 p.m..

Saturday from 9:00 a.m. - 11:00 p.m.

Sunday from 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.

MEALS

Meals are an integral part of the experience

and participants should plan to have all meals

with the group. There is no additional charge

for meals:

Cost of the training is S25.00.

The training will be in the evening November 22, 23, and 24th, 7:30 to 10:00 P.M. at the National Center

8080 El Paseo Grande, La Jolla, California.

In order to be eligible to take the leader training it will have been necessary for each potential leader to

have experienced a complete TORI weekend.

For the first time we will be providing a program to train leaders in conducting the TORI Community

Experience.

MES FROM OUR NEW MEN ERSHIP DIRECTOR

Dear Fellow Member?

As your new membership director I would like to tell you how excited

am about the exciting things that are happening at the National Center.

But, before I go into that, let me tell you now I became associated with

1r..

A DPP on September 26

and 27, led by Al Lewis and Winnie Yee, convi

me of what. I had increasingly come to believe over the last two years--t

the ultimate

beauty in the world is the human being--you and me--each of

raw material

for the most beautiful works that can possibly be created.

I came to the Harvard Business School from New Delhi, India, in May.

with the intention of acquiring the skills to go and capture for myself

treasures of the outside world.

Oh! I was determined to be relentless

my seeking and if someone got hurt, or had to be hurt, it was going to

i

E.

. all in the line of business.

Now, having gotren my MBA and having started work on my Ph.D. in Lead

1 Behavior at USIU, I'm realizing that there is something €

more important: for me to. do, and this. is to strive to tap more of my owr

• inner, infinite potentialities;: to strive for growth as a person, to mal

The real treasure lies within me, not

-... outside of me.

Well, I'm embarked on this journey-on this adventure ir

• becoming more of a person.

But I have realized too, that I can do this only with the help of ott

• people.

I can only actualize my infinite potentialities by helping othe

actualize theirs.

And so, I accepted

the responsibility that Al Lewis

quested me to take up--and I have launched the 1970 Fall Membership Dris

My goal

is to double our present membership, l.e. to increase the numbe

of Participating Members by at. least 240 by December, 1970.

That's the

very least the Center must do. That's the smallest

increase my conscier

will allow me. Our long range goal is to reach

out to the millions in

Diego, in the U.S.A., and elsewhere around the world.

in this, I need your help. Will you join with me in this progra

••to reach out to more people?

would like to suggest this to each memb

Reach out to one person in each of the last three months of 1970 and as!

him to become a Participating Member of the National Center.

Also, ple.

renew your own membership if it's about to expire.

Al and

I have devel

a list of privileges for members (see articles on membership and salen

ranes), but these are all insignificant relative to the inner joy of

helping people to become everything they are meant to be.

Two other important programs, the Community Action Program and the

Model Projects Program, have been launcher.

The National Center is goi

forward.

This is due to you and other members like yourself.

Now I"m

asking. more of your-to help us reach our objective of at least another

240 members by December, 1970.

Thanks, and Love to all of you.

BY JEROME

I have made arrangements whereby I can contact

ISAAC CANTRELL at a pay telephone during a five minute period

of time once a week.

The next scheduled contact period is

for the middle of next week. He wants to be contacted at

that time as he wants to have some phony identification

made up for him. He feels he needs this extra identification

in order to hide out or conceal himself in the event it 100ks

as though the authorities are going to try to bust him again.

He apparently is still capable of producing his

homemade machine guns, and there is some indication he may be

willing to trade a completed model of this machine gun for

the phoney identification.

Nothing specticular happened, and I was unable

I was talking to SAM DAVIS last night and he

told me an interesting thing.

He said that some of the

Minutement have discovered that their fingerprints can

be temporarily disfigured or obliterated simoly by

spraying then with this new clear spray bandadge or. by

rubbing white glue like Elmer's Glue on them.

We Move that this Association (organization, institution) endorse a people's

commission with a mandate

(A) to communicate this motion to the Vietnamese people

(B) to engage in discussions with representatives of the Democratic Republic

(C) to study and recommend ways and means to withdraw the resourtes of this

At the same time the Nixon Administration has misrepresented the highly volatile

een rising and open opposition to the Thieu-Ky-Kiem regime and to the American pre-.

ence, by students, war veterans, women, workers, intellectuals, journalists, Buddhists

nd others. These groups are openly willing to communicate with the NIE, and to enter

nto a coalition with the Provisional Revolutionary Govt. of South Viet Nam (PRG)

For that reason it is urgent that the PRG proposal (Paris. Sept. 17, 1970) receive

lair consideration. It sets forth the following princioles as the basis for a just

ind honorable peace: (1) the total withdrawal of all U.S. military forces from Viet

lam by a date to be specified by the U.S. - parhaps June 30, 1971, as in the

Hatfield - McGovern amendment; (2) total withdrawal of all U.S. military and econom-

Ic support of the Thien-ky-Kiem regime: (3) total non-intervention by the U.S. in the

interusal inlitical atfairs of Viet Nam. When these conditions are met the Vietnamese

rill (1) form a Provisional Coalition Coverment

nediately all captured soldiers and political prisoners: and (3)refrain from attacking

J.S, forces in the process of withdrawal.

The U.S. Government has not taken those steps, nor has it even taken the vronos

necessary for citizens and for groups to cease depending on the Government and

to attempt dircut, contact with the Vietnamese. The endorsement of the Peonlé's

BY JEROME

Yesterday I checked the Minutemen Post Office

Box in Spring Valley and found an answer to the letter

valley, and ment

we sent to the new Minutement group in Elgin, Illinois.

The envelope was post marked February 8, 1971, and so

has probably been in the Post Office Box for several

days. The contents were wrapped in true Minutement

fashion and copies are attached. I will have to have

the original back for future business.

I showed the letter to SAM DAVIS last night.

He was fasinated and excited by the letter and immediately

called JIM POTO who is back in town from Phoenix, Arizona.

POTO, in turn, is suppose to have tried to make arrange-

me in mysel pot cal DaVIS to contact EV MOORE,

Saturday, February 20, 1971, at the Gun show in Yuma,

Arizona.

MOORE, who resides in Phoenix, is suppose to

be a big Minutemen leader who was close up under DE PUGH.

He may possibly have been the counter part of TROY

HOUGHTON which would have made hir the regional coordinator

of the Minutemen organization in Arizona.

He is said

to have some excellent contacts on the east coast.

If it is not possible for us to meet at Yuma,

we will then call on HOORE at Phoenix some time in the

next couple of weeks.

POTO, who I understand just barely returned

from Arizona,

has advised that MoORE has been wanting

to make some

contacts in the San Diego area.

According

to POTO, possible reasons for this would be that Bego MoORE

is tied

up with the new group at Elgin, Illinois, and

does not want the DE PUGH family to regain control of

the organization. Furthermore, it does not appear that

the new Minutement group has a

regional coordinator for

the southern California area at this time and MOORE

may be wanting to find someone

to nominate.

Deas Mr Morgan,

We are most happy to hear from you and to find out that

there are still some loyal members left in the Sandiego area.

We are the same organization minus the fanily of Bob Depugh

and a few of the parasites who moved in on the old National

headquarters at Norborne. So there is nothing to do really

other than pick up where

you left off and continue to work

along our original goals.

We have had to increase security somewhat but not too

much I hope to prevent us meeting some time in the future.

I enclose a febauary bulletin for your files, Keep us informed

as. to

the situation in your area.

Yours for AmeriC&,

JANUARY BULLETIN

+ pr

A new year is upon us and there is much to report both good and bad concerning

our struggle for a free America.

We will dwell shortly on the bad news first: Many of you have inquired about

the fate of Thomas K. Stewart who has been indicted on several counts of Armed

Robery stemming from a series of very successful raids against the Socialist

Worker's Party ard The Young Socialisi, Alliance. The trials on all these charges

are still pending and Mi. Stewart 1s out on $30, 000.00 bond at this time. The

arrargements of legal council and tactics have kept a number of the staff here at

the National Coordinating. Center busy fo. quite some time. The cost of all this

as you can well imagine has been very high, but it is our sworn duty to do all we

can for Patriots such as Tom Stewart. As for more information about the case,

the legal aspects are better if we make no public comment. at this time,

Suffice it to say that the cases are heavy on our minds at this time.

The good news is somewhat more extensive, and is as follows:

The recruiting drive up and down the east coast is going very well and

we will soon be over our goals there.

Regional direcrors left to be appointed.

3, The printing and reprinting of material is proceeding at a slow but

steady pace.

As of this time the two most important considerations we have are security

and recruiting. We uge all members to try and finish their training Phase as

fasi as possible, but for the interim we will enclose as part of this Bulletin a copy

of Practical Security measures which we feel all members should read and put into

practice as soon as possible.

The full report. on the S.D.S. Convention which was held in Chicago on

December 27th ührough December 30th, This exiensive report will be available

io all members fo: the cost of printing alone.

se use of checks

postal money orders. In moder!

banking practice all checks at

ilmed and such records are kept for years. Ordinary cash is the best thing to send

suse the risk of a small finarcial loss in the mail is much less than the possible loss

your life when the communists take complete control.

2. Use deceptive measures.. Subscribe to one or more left-wing periodicals or get on th

mailing list of some 'peace movement'. This will keep the postal inspectors guessing as

to which side you are really on. See the December issue of On Target for names and addr

• of many left-wing organizations or write to National Headquarters for this information. W

doing this our members can be of great assistance in searching this left-wing literature fo

names and addresses of fellow travelers and forwarding this information for our Central

Intelligence files. We desperately need people to assist in this work. Please inquire as

detailed instructions for such activity.

• 3. Always use two envelopes in sending mail to any patriotic organization or to any

other member of our organization. Do not put a return address on the outer envelope. Put

your return address on the inside envelope with the words, "Return postage guaranteed".

4. Place some opaque material such as tin foil, carbon paper, etc. between the inner

and outer envelopes to prevent your mail from being read by infra-red cameras.

5. Send all letters from corner mail boxes or from post offices where you are not known.

6. Be cardful in the use of the telephone. Avoid telephone calls to Natiönal Headquarte

or to known members of the organization as much as possible.

7.. Prepare telephone codes ahead of time for future protection.

8. In recruiting new members always learn as much as you can about the prospective

recruit and make sure he is not an infiltrator before you identify yourself as a member of

the organization.

9. Members of the organization in each area should be divided into four groups.

A. Those who have been identified publicly or by law enforcement

agencies as members of the Minutemen,

B. Those persons not known as members of this organization but who

are generally known as being patriots.

C. Those persons who have kept their political beliefs hidden.

D. Members who profess to be liberal for the purpose of infiltrating

enemy organizations.

All members should be very careful in making contact with persons in a different category

than themselves. For example, people in Class D should be very secret in their.con-

tacts and communications with persons of Class A or Class B. Each member must respect

the security of every other member, Do not, under any circumstances, identify one membe

of the organization even to other members without his expressed permission on cach and

every occasion.

10. Avoid loose tall, Do not discuss organizational plans in public places whore you

¿Do not write patriotic letters to newspapers or magazines under your own name. To.

so achieves very little except to identify you to the enemy,

12. If you are already known as a patriot, or as a member of this organization you may

find: advisable to spread the rumor that you have become disillusioned with the right-

wing or for you to pretend a gradual loss of interest.

13. Classify your various members addresses, your communications and your other ac-

tivities as 'top secret', 'secret' or 'restricted'. Use your most secretlines of communica-

tion only for the most important messages rather than flooding them with unimportant mater

lal,

14. Demand obedience to all security measures from all members, Persistent disregard

for security measures should be cause for disciplinary action.

15,. Check your lines of communication from time to time by sending phoney messages to

make certain they are not intercepte,

16. Change mail drops, meeting places, etc. frequently.

17. Prepare secret rendezvous points, mail drops, etc. now that may be used in time of

some future emergency.

18. Each band should assign some member the rank of Security Officer and should set

up a system of fines.or other penalties for failure to comply with security precautions.

19, Observe the 'need to know' rule. Each member should be given only that informatior

which is needed by him in the performance of his duty or which he will need in cooperating

with other members of the band. No member should feel 'left out' because he is denied

such information. Instead every member should willingly avoid information which he does

notreed.

20. Be careful that you are not followed in going to and from meeting places or in makir

contac: with other members of the organization.

21, Keep all records and correspondence carefully hidden and in a manner that they can

be easily destroyed. Records should be kept in code whenever possible.

22, Important as secrecy may be, it is not the only essential facior in a successful

underground movement. Morale and efficiency are equally important. Elaborate security

measures aiways. reduce efficiency to a greater or lesser degree. Unnecessary security

can cicate an atmosphere of suspicion that is devastating to the esprit de corps of any

organization. Find a proper balance between security and efficiency.

ON F'EBRUARY 23, 1971

BY JEROME

ISAAC CANTRELL WaS Contacted last night. He said

he would make available, 5 or 6.45 caliber machine gun

barrels. He said these can be picked up Friday, the 26th

of february, from another person, not CANtRElL.

He said

he will also make contact with a person in Nevada who

owns a mine and who can furnish large quantities of dynamite.

CANTRELL still appears to be paranoid and claims

he is followed about three days a week by someone driving

a red Datsun or Toyota automobile.

CANTRELL did considerable talking about police

officer BUD BENNETT.

This is apparently the officer

responsible for CANTRELL's recent arrest and CANTRELI

hates him intensely.

He said he wants to acquire all

available information regarding BENNETT such as his home

address and telephone number and the license number and

description of the automobile which he drives.

CANTRELL also claimed he has a case of dynamite

buried in the vicinity of Indio, California.

A right wing individual named DAVE KNORR was

contacted last week.

He claimed to know of the existence

of a group of Minutemen (MM) at Alpine, California.

He

said these persons are always interested in purchasing

weapons.

While at the gun show at Yuma, Arizona, last weekend,

he met an Individual named BOB KYLE who is supposed to be

• JERRY GEYER's best friend. KYLE had

several magazines for

• the Russian AK 47 automatic rifle which sold very fast.

KYLE's wife is named GINGER. KYLE is about 5'7" tall,

He may work

seems to have excellent

access to parts to military weapons. It was mentioned that

he does some dealing with Marines at Camp Pendleton.

Another of GEYER's friends who was at the gun show

was LARRY STORCK (PH) who had a fairly large number of

weapons to seel. He was about 30 years old, 6'2"

tall, or

taller, dark brown hair.

(Possibly identical with LARRY

STORTS, a former san Diego police officer who left the

department to go to law school.)

About 3/1/71, BARRY GODFREY was in contact

with SAM DAVIS.

Apparently, DAVIS and GODFREY were

discussing the

disappearance of TROY HOUGHTON.

DAVIS

mentioned that at some unspecified time, he had talked

to a man who he did not identily:

He claimed to have

been present when HOUGHTON was killed. DAVIS said this

man told him HOUGHTaN was poisoned with cyanide somewhere

in Louisiana and then his body was left in the swamps there.

PETER RUPLINGER was contacted yesterday and

• the photograph of MORRIS STARSKEY was shown to him.

He

said that for sometime now, he has been trying to find out

who STARSKEY is and has even been following him from time

to time looking for a chance to pick up his briefcase.

RUPLINGER said he has also been following LEON NOWERS around

somet na shanne to

the campus, the last time being the day before yesterday:

He said on

that day, NOWERS went to the Student Placement

Office, where he reviewed the files maintained there on

FBI and CIA employment.

He said he believes possibly

NOWERS was looking for names of students who are applying

or have applied for work with these Government agencies.

There is a rumor going around that the Minutemen

may try to stage some opposition to any san Diego area

anti-war activities to be held on 4/15/71.

Io the best of my knowledge,. I have not heard of

any MM or other right wingers being involved in a Confederate

skirmish unit at Ramona, California, as reported in yesterday's

Evening Tribune.

BY JEROME

It has been leaned that last Friday, SAM DAVIS

was doing a lot of talking about shooting people. He said

even it he eventually leave this area, he wild make

trips back for the purpose of eliminating some people.

He then said that at one time, he almost killed a girlfriend

of GEORGE HOOVER.

She was then living at the ranch with

HOOVER but returned to Germany, where she was born, when

they broke up.

DAVIS said he was in favor of killing her because

she apparently knew too much and wanted to set up a shooting

accident at the ranch to get rid of her.

GEORGE HOOVER

vetoed the idea however, and they. let her return to Germany.

Last sunday, at the Gunsmoke Ranch, It was observea

that a complex range

system nas been set up there.

There are

many people who come there frequently to practice and sometimes

there are as many as 50 persons present. Last Sunday, STAN

MC DADE and his son, BARRY GODFREY, ROGER WILLIS, a FRANK LNU

and 4 other people were there practicing.

It was observed that

several of these people are quite proficient on the range

and in the handling the use of their weapons.

He observed

that STAN MC DADE and BARRY GODFREY, while digging through

a pile of junk on the range, came across a piece of a .50

caliber machine gun; which is interesting.

It is known that BETTIE HOUGHTON has always wanted

to be interviewed by FBI about the disappearance of her husband,

TRoy and now might be even more willing to discuss matters

• relating to her husband and to DEPUGH.

Report of Jerome

PETER RUFLINGER was contacted this morning.

He

claims that there will be nine buses going from San Diego

State to the anti-war demonstration at San Fransisco on

the twentyfourth of this month. He said he will find out

later from where and when they are leaving and how many

people will be on the buses.

He knows about the $900 given

the demonstrators by the school and will try to find out if

they get any more money from other sources.

STAN MC DADE was also contacted this morning and

was accompanied by HOWARD CLEVELAND. It was learned that

NO DADE and HOWARD GODFREY were at Camp Pendleton yesterday

looking at the scrap parts pile of the Ordnance Disposal

unit there. They believe

there may be several complete

weapons of various kinds which could be made from the scrap

parts.

For this reason they are considering submitting a

bid on the some forty tons of

scrap which is to be sold.

It was learned that JOHN BUSE is also going to enter a bid.

MC DADE and CLEVELAND indicated they are going to

the deseret in the morning to spend several days doing some

shooting and exploring.

BY JEROME

SAM DAVIS was contacted yesterday.

He had been

to BETTIE HAUGHTON's place and had received

from her the

complete list of former Minuteman members which was in her

possession.

She is also going to give him all the field

manuals she has, several cases of them, and her medical

supplies.

SAM said he also believes he knows the identity

of

the man who helped Thoy HaUciton bury his caches of

weapons and supplias in the Sierras.

Included in this

stuff is supposed to be an entire packaged Army field

hospital which was allegedly stolen from the military. SAM

said he will try to get acquinted with this person.

A person named DON CAREY has come to my attention.

He is also known as DON VON BECK. and HENNING VON BECK.

He

clams to be the son of a World War II German general named

VON BECK. He works as a blaster for Canyon Rock and Gravel

Company and has told people he has a cabin near Campo and

three rented garages in which he has stored a lot of weapons,

parts,

ammunition and explosives. He is believed to be a

lot of talk. I will try to find out more about him.

Report of -Jerome

SAM DAVIS was overheard to say that an individual

named RON ZARiCKis one of the bisgest weapons suppliers in

the San Diego area and can usually get anything that SAM

asks him for. This is supposed to be one of SM's contacts

who is trying to get him a grease gun or a sten gun.

It was also learned that a woman named LILLIAN

(LNU) is coming down from Los Angeles next week. She is

the wife of the owner of a R Sales and will be in town to

take an order from SAM for some M-15 comversion kits. A R

Sales allegedly has a huge inventory of weapons parts and

is also supposed to be dealing in automatic weapons.

SAM claimed to have purchased $500 worth of M-2

conversion parts from TOM FORREST last month.

He indicated

that most or all of these parts would go to the Cuban

refugees through LoU CoNdE.

Report of Jerome

It has been learned that HOWARD GODFREY waS at

Gerry Geyer's house yesterday.

GEYER gave GODFREY six

booby trap sirulators.

He hinted he has a contact who

may have stoen 3000 Army manuals on booby trap devices

being used in

Viet Nam.

Gaver seems to get most of his

material from 303 KILE and TOM FO3RE3T.

I am to contact SAi. DAVIS tomorrow morning and

then so with him to BocTI fAtGhtoN's house to pick up the

field manuals and other sugglies she has. We will sort

through the manuals for those we want and then sell the rest.

any money made from these sales will be given back to BETTIE.

An individual named GENE BROWN is supposed to come

down from the Los Angeles area tomorrow aftermoon.

We will

meet him at the Zoo entrance at about 2:00 pm.

This is for

the purpose of making contact with some of the Right Wing.

sympathizers at Los Angeles.

The woman from A R Sales is LILLIAN KARNES.

#R

Sales is making an alloy receiver for the .45 auto oistol,

and there was a big write up on the company and the receiver

In the last issue of "Guns anà Ammo" magazine.

It is rumored

around that her husband was picked up at one time with 500

machineguns in his possession, so the business is now in

the name of his wife and allegedly being run by her.

LILLIAN KARNES is supposed to be a Puerto Rican

and SAl: thinks she and her company are supolying weapons

and other items. to the Cuban refugees. This has made SA

interested in contacting the Alpha 56 group, and he wants

to go talk to LoU CONde to see if this can be arranged.

REPORT BY JERONE

I was in telephone contact with SAM DAVIS today.

He appears to be very hooked on joining the American

Nazi Party.

StAN MC DAdE is the one who is pushing the

hardest on joining the Nazis. I understand that DAVIS

and MC DADE will get together to look for office space

for the Nazi Party headquarters in the San Diego area.

DAVIS also said he is going out tomorrow to

for this purpose.

financial help from the Nazi Party at Los Angeles.

DAVIS also advised he knows of the whereabouts

of one of TROY HAUGHTON's old hideouts.

He said this

hideout is still in tact and usable and that he, DAVIS,

might have to make use of it himself if things get to

hot for him in San Diego. He mentioned that HAUGHTON stayed

in this hideout for a long period of time on one occasion

when the police department was looking for him.

It was

thought that he was not in town because they had been unable

to find him.

Davis said, to the best of his knowleage,

the

location of

the hideout is now known only to him and BETTIE

HAUGHTON.

in this mattor, they interposed no objection to returning to

LAVIs deactivated or inort blasting caps, feeling that the

record of their possession by the Government and disposition

would serve as well for evidence purposes as having the caps

themselves.

On 8/3/71 SGT. WILLIAM BIRCH, 70th Ordnance Detach-

ment (EOD), Fort. Rosecrans, San Diego, Calffornia, advised

that thore is no effective way that the blasting caps in

question could be deactivated without extreme danger to the

attempting this action and without it being obvious that

the caps had been tampered with.

SGT. BIRCH advised that the

manufacturers ci all

such blasting caps make inert caps which

for training and identification purposes which are indistin-

guishible from the live ones. He said that in his opinion

the best course of action would be to obtain such inert caos

to substitue for the ones now in the possession of the Govern-

ment.

He said that the best source of information as to where

to obtain these substitues would be the Institut of Hakers of

Explosives, 420 Lexington Ave., New Jork City, 10017.

I was in contact with PAUL RUPLINGER. He continued

to be interested in creating disturbances and offered to

take Right Wing leaders for a drive along Interstate 8 to

show them where they could use dynamite on underpasses and

overpasses to create the most disruption. It has been learned

that SAM DAVIS and BARRY GODFREY may arive up to Los Angeles

tomorrow to contact the people who own

and run AR Sales,

for

the purpose of finding out about the availability of military

manuals and various weapons:

DAVIS, GODFREY and MC DADE continue to talk about

setting up a new organization to handle Right wing activities

in the San Diego area.

Arrangements have been made for them

to meet soon at a drive-in restaurant to talk about ways

and means of setting up such an organization with a legal

defense fund, a newspaper or bulletin and harassment

activities.

I have heard there will be an American Legion

march in downtown San Diego on Sunday, 4/4/71, to protest

the court-martial of It. MILLIAM CALLeT.

This march

is being sponsored partially by Radio Station KSON and all

Right wing groups in the San Diego area are being urged

co j01n 1n.

A call has been put out for 50,000 participants

and to the best of my knowledge, no parade permit has beer

obtained from the san Diego POlice Department.

I was in

contact with one of the women who is pushing the march. She

has telephone 276-6648.

According to her, the march will

start about 12 NOON from the Navy Recreation Field at Harbor

Drive and Market Street, will proceed up Harbor Drive to

8th Avenue, from there to Broadway and then back to Harbor

Drive and the Recreation Field for a rally.

The woman

told me they have received 3700 phone alls since last

night.

She said the march seems to be getting much support

from the military, adding that two Generals and three Colonels

have indicated they will participate in the march in full

uniform.

I was in contact with SAM DAVIS last night.

He claimed to have received a call earlier in the

evening from the Klu Klux Klan in Mississippi. The

only explanation he would give is that something he was

involved in there broke open and he is afraid he may be

arrested soon.

If so, he says he knows who is responsible

and he will take care of them later. However, he is very

shaken up and has been talking about going underground until

the problem blows over.

In the past he has claimed to have

2o have

been involved in robberies,

burglaries, and illegal weapons

deals which may account for what he is afraid of now.

However, if he is still in town on sunday, he

will join in the march protesting the trial of It. CALLEY

and may try to start a confrontation if people show up to

demonstrate against the march.

It has been learned that SAM DAVIS and GEORGE

HOOVER left yesterday morning to go to a construction

project in Arizona.

They intend to make use of this trip

to make contacts with people they know or have heard of in

Las Vegas, Phoenix, and El Paso.

They are supposed to call

back after making these contacts. DAVIS left his brief-case

with BARRY GODFREY and because of what happened in Mississippi,

was talking about the possibility of going underground bu's

sneaking back to the San Diego area later on.

The person to be contacted in Phoenix is EV MoORe.

DAVIS claims that of the Right ving groups that

are still intact, the one at Las Vegas is the best run

and is already functioning. He said it is supposed to have

Mafia connections and is also the best source of many kinds

of supplies.

DAVIS wants the San Diego area Post Office Box

which was rented in BILL CLAY!s name dropped and a new. lost

Office Box rented so that CLAY cannot get at the mail.

I was in contact with SAM DAVIS yesterday.

He had come from BETTIE HAUGHTON'S place.

She gave him

the entire former Minuteman membership list which

she had in her possession, along with cases of field

manuals and other literature as well as a large quantity

of medical supplies and items. DAVIS seems to think

he knows the name of the person who helped TROY HAUGHTON

as in the

bury many of his supplies in the sierras, included among

which is supposed to be a whote packaged Army field

hospital which they stole somewhere.

I have come across an individual named DON

CAREY.

He is also known as DON VON BECK and to some people

as HENNING VON BECK. He claims to be the son of the

German World War II General named VON BECK.

He is a blaster

for Canyon Rock and Gravel Company. He impresses, me as being

a big talker out claims to have a cabin at Campo and three

rented garages full of weapons, includng machine guns,

weapons parts, ammunition and explosives.

SAM claims that he can order me a Sten gun for $100.

He also says that TOM FORREST is one of his two San Diego

suppliers but that he makes most of his purchases in Washington

and Oregon.

DAVIS claims he has been dealing with FORREST

for about 6 - 8 months and claims to have recently purchased

$500 worth of i-2 carbine parts from FORREST for the purpose

of making short M-2 "enforcers".

According to what DAVIS has been saying, FORREST

appears to have contacts with military personnel at Camp

Pendleton through which he makes weekly raids on armories

and the supplies there. DAVIS has apparently asked BARRY

GODFREY to go with him

to Camp Pendleton to show him the

location of the scrap parts pile of the ordnance disposal

unit on that base.

DAVIS continues to talk about and work on the Right

Wing organization he wants to establish. His idea is to

contact people he knows in Phoenix, Seattle, Portland, and

Las Vegas and have individuals in all those

cities give out

a press release announcing the formation of the new organization.

NW 55009

DocId: 32989524 Page 494

## Page 495

In addition, leaflets and stickers will be put out the same

day and post office boxes for the organization retned in all

these cities on the same day so as to completely disguise the

location of the national headquarters which will be in San

Diego, with DAVIS and GODFREY running the thing. He wants

to structure the organization along military lines with

military ranks and training for the purpose of creating a

Right wing organization to overthrow the government in this

country.

I was told by Barry Godfrey that he and George

Hoover went by Peace House #1 at 2143 Market Street last

night. Godfrey said the place appeared to be unoccupied

at the time and when he and Hoover looked inside,

saw it

co be tull of books and other literature, and all kinds

of materials.

They also claimed to have driven by the

house at 3121 Beech which Godfrey said is a big house at

the corner of the street.

Godtrey also stated that Hoover, Stan McDade, anc

JextY Lee Busch, went to a meeting of Gerald Lee Smith'‹

Nazi Party group last night. Hoover was wearing the uniform

of the new group he is trying to organize.

This organization

will-be a branch of the Missionary Church of Jesus Christ

headed by Reverend Gale at Los Angeles, California.

While at the meeting, because of some internal

trouble, and because they liked Hoover's uniform better

than the Nazi uniform, most of Smith's group decided to

leave the Nazi Party organization and join Hoover's new

group.

I don't know anything about a Reverend Pike or

Peak, but the Reverend Gale may be the same one who is head

of Missionary Church of Jesus Christ at Los Angeles. Gale

comes to town about once a month to fulfill a speaking

assignment here.

He has Nazi and anti-Semitic tendencies

although he is not known to me as being a member of the

Nazy Party•

• Also,

I have heard nothing about threatening

telephone calls being made by anyone locally to obtain the

release of the Patriotic Party members in Michigan; however,

with the individuals

in Michigan named Freed.

At one time, she told me she

and Freed both belonged to some German club and showed me a

photograph of her and Freed together at a meeting in Santa

Ana, California.

McNichols claimed to have been the Secretary-

Treasurer of the Western Region of the Patriotic Party,

• covering 1l western states and is also a close associate

of Robert Bolivar DePugh.

McNichols is also acquainted

with Reverend Gale, who has been connected with the Patriotic

Party.

McNichols and her husband, Leo, own and operate

a grocery store on Main Street in Julian named the Mountain

Market.

I believe that Margaret McNichols is the type of

of members of the Patritic Party, but do not know if she has

actually done this.

BY JEROME

I was talking with BARRY GODFREY last night. He

said he had just spent sometime with SAM DAVIS the same

evering and that DAVIS admitted to being a total anarchist.

He said that DAVIS thinks that the u.s. government is as

much an enemy of the people, meaning right wing conservatives

• as the left wing movenent is. He said DAVIS is

still interested

in aitempting to formulate a new organization to take the

place of the old Minuteman Group. BARRY said DAVIS Wants

to set up 2 right wing groups, one, an open group which

would conduct intelligence. type operations and the other a

covert group which would conduct sabotage and harassment

and obtain such things as explosives and machine guns... ..

GODFREY said the conversation with DAVIS got

around to TROY HOUGHTON and DAVIS said he has known for

two years what actually happened to HOUGHTON and added that

BETTY HOUGHTON has also had the same information. According

to DAVIS, a meeting was held at which BETTY HOUGHTON, DAVIS,

PAUL HUNT, DENNIS MOWER, GEORGE HOOVER, and one other unidentified

Individual were present. The meeting was held for the purpose

of hearing an oral report from MARY TOLLERTON as to what had

happened to TROY HOUGHTON, that he had been held prisoner by .

ROBERT DE PUGH in the basement of DE PUGH's house with the help

Of WALTER PEYSON.

BY JEROME

HOUGHTON was then poisoned to death and his

body disposed of somewhere in the State of Missourl. After

the meeting, BETTY HOUGHTON was in favor of making all this

Information public and requesting a grand jury investigation

Of DE PUGH and PEYSON for her husband's death. However, the

other people present at the meeting talked her out of this

close of action.

GODFREY then said DAVIS told him that he knows of a

total of five people who were killed by DE PUGH, including

TROY HOUGHTON. He said two of these were killed after

HOUGHTON's death to keep his murder quiet. DAVIS said that

MARY TOLLERTON was being hidden in the Los Angeles area for

quite a while by DENNIS MOWER, PAUL HUNI and others as there

was thought DE PUGH was looking for her to kill her. Some row,

she got away from MOWER and HUNT for a period of about six months

but then they got her back again. Allegedly, BETTY HOUGHTON

told MOWER to keep track of MARY TOLLERTON at all cost even

If he had to marry her..

According to DAVIS, it is his beller HOUGHION was

killed by DE PUGH as DE PUGH thought HOUGHTON had already

contacted the FBI or was in the process of arranging such a

contact for the purpose of informing on DE PUGH's activities.

This morning, I met an Individual named RON ZARICK

who was attempting to sell military ammunitions of several

calibers. I will try to find out more about him later.

I aiso loarned that there were .12 members of the

NSWPP at the anti-war demonstration at NEL Center yesterday.

SAM DAVIS may also have been there as he appeared to know

...a 1ot about it. DAVIS has had a project going to get himself

fired from his job and may already have been successful. If

so, he will go on unemployment and then on welfare in order

to be able to devote full time to his right wing activities.

He has approached me about going to a meeting at Los Angeles.

in the next few days with representatives of the Minutemen

organization, the states Right Party, and the NSWP for

the purpose of discussing the possibility of an alliance of these

groups. He mentioned that the national leader of the States

Rights. Party may be at the meeting. I will try to find out

more about this also.

• I also learned that DAVIS wants to set up a course

of instruction In the use of explosives which would start

off with a group composed of BARRY GODFREY and two men selected

by him and SAM DAVIS and two men selected by him.

I was in conversation with PAUL RUPLINGER and

General LEMLEY yesterday. LEMLEY said he has some M-16

rifles and has been giving weapons to all of his neighbors

for self defense..

IRMLEY is extremely militant and I understand

that:he, RUPLINGER, and perhaps SAM DAVIS refused to f111

the U.S. Census Forms which they received and expected to

be arrested shortly and placed in jail.

LENLEY says that lots of weapons and other items of

military equipment are coming down to the U.s. out of Canada.

LEMLEY was extremely upset at the arrests made by ATFD and

local law enforcement officers at the Pasadena Gun Show on

6/19/71. He said he was going to contact the headquarters of

the John Birch Society (which he is deeply involved in) at

San Marino, and have that organization check into the arrests.

PAUL RULINGER was also very upset about the situation.

It should be noted that in talking with RON ZARICK

before the gun show took place, he warned me to be cautious

at the gun show as he had received word that the ATFD and

State officials were planning to make arrests at the show.

It has come to my attention that both SAM DAVIS

and BARRY GODFREY are fairly well acquainted with SCOTT

WINCHESTER, leader of the Nazl Party Group, Bishop Factions

at Los Angeles, California.

JUNE 23, 1971

BY JEROME

WINCHESTER appears to be a near kook. He was one

of the more active participants in the anti-war demonstration

sponsored by MDM at Oceanside, California, in May, 1970. He

was running around like a roving idiot and screaming, "fascist

pigs" at the police.

SAM DAVIS says he heard that the NSWPP at San

Diego might favor a split from the NSWPP at Los Angeles

which is headed by (FNU) TOMASCO and join up with WINCHESTER's

group. It this happens,

It will take place through the

efforts of VIC WALTON OF

BERTRAM COMPARET.

REPORI BY JEROME

I was in contact with SAM DAVIS this morning.

He finally got his wish and was fired from his job.

did not go to work as he was supposed to this morning

and while I was at his house his boss called saying that

he had some important jobs for DAVIS to take care of.

He

said if DAVIS could not be more reliable, he, the boss,

would have to find someone else to do the job. DaVIs

then told him to go ahead and find someone else whereupon

his boss hung up.

DAVIS said he has another job to go

to in the middle of next week for one ROGER (LNU).

This

job will last approximately one month following which

DAVIS will be laid off and then can claim unemployment

and welfare while devoting full time to his activities.

He believes he can draw unemployment for a period of

approximately six months. He talked again about the explo

sives and other materials which he has and some of which he

has given to me.

He said he has come across opportunities to buy

other such materials at lairly low cost and.

therefore,

wants to sell some of the stuff he now has to get money to

buy these other materials and also to help the Nazi Party

out financially.

DAVIS stated that it is his intention to join .

the American Nazi

Party and showed me his membership

application form.

It is my understanding that the local Nazi

group which has,

in the past, been part of the National Socialist

White Peoples Party (NSWPP),

will switch allegiance in the

California.

If and when this takes place, the name they

apparently will use for the new group is American Socialist

Workers Party.

DAVIS is all excited about buying uniforms

and other things to get ready to go on "storm trooper"

duty.

He said he is going to try and get all of his

associates,

including GEORGE HOOVER, STAN MC DADE, JAMES

POTO, BARRY GODFREY, ROGER WILLIS and "AL" (LNU) to join

also.

## Page 512

According to DAVIS, the Nazi Party group which he

has been hearing so much

about lately is only a segment of

the total Nazi group in the San Diego

GERALD I. K.

what Is called a section leader.

the leader of this active group, is

apparently only

There are apparently

several sections of the Nazi Party group in San Diego

and overall leader for the whole group.

DAVIS said that he and three other people, one

of whom will probably be STAN MC DADE and the other

members of the NSWPP in San Diego, will go to Los Angeles

soon to see SCOTT WINCHESTER and make arrangements for

merging with his group.

DAVIS says that the Nazi Party group is good

on organizing but poor on weapons acquisition and intelligence

work.

He said he expects to be of considerable help to the

Nazis in these two areas.

He said

he has been in contact with BARRY GODFREY

and had asked him to do some work on compiling a list of

liberal members of the Jewish coumunity in san Diego as

a starting point for harassment and other tactics by the

Nazis.

He said that the Nazis have been using DON SISCO'S

Militants Formulary as a handbook for training. in explosives

He said SIsCo himself is reported to be a section

leader for either the Bishop Faction of the Nazi farty or

the NSWPP •

DAVIS' telephone number is listed in the directory

under B. L. GIBSON at 2393 Washington, Lemon Grove, California.

Ihe telephone number is 465-9572.

DAVIS indicated that he has been offered 100

grenade bodies with the necessary parts to make live

weapons from them for a sum of $25.00.

This morning I observed all the parts of a dis-

assembled •30 caliber Browning air-cooled machine gun in

the back room of the Bullseye Gun Shop.

SAM DAVIS says he has an operation in mind for

this weekend. He said he wants BARRY GODFREY to provide

six men; DAVIS will provide another six and the NSWPP will

{urnish 12 men to conduct a raid on a faculty office at UCSD,

where a Viet Cong Flag is supposed to be hanging. The pur-.

pose-of the raid will be to seize the flag, take it out on

the campus, and burn it in front of as large. a crowd as they

can get.

DAVIS said he is also trying to get ahold of a .

white phosphorous grenade for another project he has in

mind for the weekend, but would not even hint as to what

he is thinking of using it for.

I went to a recent meeting of the NSWPP with

STAN MC DADE. GERALD L. SMITH was speaking. One of the other

people at the meeting had a medal for what is referred to

by the American Nazi Party as the "Virginia Campaign", which

occurred in 1958. These medals were awarded by GEORGE LINCOLN

RoCkwElL, which would indicate that the person I saw at the

meeting must be a longtime Nazi Party member. This individual

said he is going to Los Angeles soon with MC DADE and

SMITH to meet with Nazi Party Officials there.

MC DADE has been gathering a big list of Jews

for the NSWPP and was asking about the location of a

good uniform shop

as he wants to buy a Khaki Uniform to

wear to meetings.

It appears that PETER RUPLINGER has a friend

in a small arms arsenal or depot on one of the local

Navy Bases. He has been offering the sale of four M-2

conversion kits, and says he thinks he will be able to

furnish all the small arms including grenades and possibly

a light 30 caliber machine gun that anyone would want.

He was asking BARY GODFREY iI GODFREY could obtain a tear

gas

grenade which RUPLINGER wants for the purpose of throw

ing into the "Bedroom", a local night club offering nude

entertainment.

I saw TOM FORREST yesterday and while there

observed a .45 caliber grease gun with two full magazines.

Some time ago I met a person named DICK GOULD.

• Yesterday I saw him again and he offered me a sawed off

shotgun and another shotgun. which had been made into a

pistol. He wanted $50 for both of the weapons but did not

have them with him for me to look at.

I will try to find

out more about GOULD.

Another person I have heard a lot about is

one LARRY BROWN. He apparently used to live close to

me and some friends were telling me at one time about

what a nut and raving manlac he is. He apparently has moved

to poway. Nêsterday while I was at Bulls Eye Gun Shop

BILL GUIETTE was telling me about some work he was doing

on a nine millimeter German Schmeitzer. Today I was in

• Bulls Eyes again and met this LARRY BROWN and talked to

him for about one hour. He was telling me all about his

nine millimeter German Schmeitzer and hinted that he may

have some other automatic weapons. Very likely the Schmeitzer

..GUIETTE was working on belonged to BROWN. I will also

try to find out more about BROWN.

CHUCK PIERCE, the SaR Diago Tone Bineh societ

Leader, lives at 8527 Goldenridge Road, Lakeside, California,

and has telephone number 449-4176. He and BILL GUIETTE

have been talking about joining the U.S. Army, Special

of seeing what items of equipment they can steal.

It has come to my attention that there is

an individual who may be of interest who works for the San

Diego Fire Department and is assigned to Station 13 in La

Jolla. His name is RICK BURNS and he has been overheard

to make statements which are highly pro-Russian and pro-Com-

munist China. He saves up his money and vacation time and

travels to Russia each summer.

BURNS apparently lives in the La Jolla area as he

walks to work every morning. He is about 27, 5'11", 180

husby build. He has light brown hair, a ruddy complexion,

wears reading glasses, is married and has a collie dog. He

allegedly served in the U.S. Marine Corps and has been with

the fire department for about four and one hali years.

REPORT BY JEROME

Yesterday I was in contact with PETER RUPLINGER.

He is still self employed

as a wholesale diamond dealer.

He

said one of his customers is allegedly an Italian who has

connections with the local tuna fishing association and with

the Mafia.

He said he had acquired from this person a

rifle with a silencer which he told RUPLINGER

was a Mafia

assassination weapon.

He obtained this rifle from RULINGER

yesterday evening for $20.00. The rifle is a British

Enfield bolt action

rifle and a .303 caliber. It has been

heavily modified with an

extension having been added to the

butt stock and the parts of the receiver assembly missing

exposing the internal working mechanism. The rear sight

1s-also missing.

The breech ends of the receiver and barrel on this

rifle are usually threaded with a square cut thread.

However

on this rifle.

these parts. both have a regular toothed

nachine thread which was obviasly done to allow the rifle

"to

be disassembled into two pieces.

The forestock of the rifle is also missing and

2" in diameter and 5" long and cylindrical in shape.

There is a *". diameter aluminum tube extending from the

forward bottom part of this device along the barrel almost

to the muzzle.. Attached to the muzzle is the regular issue

British flash suppressor for use on the Enfield •303 caliber

carbine.

Most of the metal parts of the rifle have been

coated with black lacquer.

When

assembled, the rifle does not headspace

properly which is apparently due to the threads being worn

or a necessary shim missing

I recontacted RUPLINGER this morning and learned .

that the individual he obtained the rifle from is one

PHILLIP SALUATO, 6766 Rose Field Drive, San Diego,

California.

RUPLINGER said SALUATO allegedly has

weapons including Thompson submachine guns and M-2 carbines

which he will sell.

RUPLINGER also said that the silenced

• NW 55009 DocId:32989524 Page 523

---

## Page 524

rifle which he sold me was supposedly delivered to SALUATO

by the Mafia for destruction or permanent disposal. He

siad SALUATO, who is apparently eager to make a fast buck,

apparently decided to sell the weapon rather than destroy it.

From my knowleage of RupLINgeR, I suspect it is

very Likely he enlarged considerably on this story.

I was In contact with SAM DAVIS again yesterday

and he mentioned again his favorite project which is to

I111 some rifle grenades with thermite and explosives and

to fire them onto the top of several gasoline and o1l

storage tanks, among those which are located in Mission

Valley near the Intersection of Murphy Canyon Road and

Firars Road. He said he belleves the results will be

spectular and that he will not permanently léave the

San Diego area without completing this project..

DAVIS continues to be extremely interested In the

local Nazi Party group and said he wants to work

: for a

high position in this organization. He says that VIC WALTON

Is deeply Involved in the NSWeP, but even though, he still

does not trust WALTON. He said he Is going ahead with plans

to locate and rent office space for the NSWPP and also set

up a printing press for that group.

' DAVIS also talked about another plan which is

being worked on to attempt to seize a Viet Cong flag which is

hanging In an office at UCSD. He said at least he would like

NW 55009 DocId: 32989524 Page 528-

## Page 529

1.

to make an effort to put a smoke grenade through the

window of this office. He sald he has been talking with

the NSWPP about taking 15 members of that group along

to protect. the person who would fire this rifle grenade

through the window. He sald the results would be better

yet if a high explosive grenade was used. He advised that

the NSWPP and others he is assoclated with are suppose to

have some LAws (alght AntI-tank Weapons) which they might

use.

FRANK YACOPEC has been fired again. He now

has a boarder llving with him who was recently discharged

from the MarIne Corps. This individual is named ROBERT S.

MAYER. He claims to be well

acquainted with the firearm

ranges at Camp. Pendleton and knows of an ammo dump there

which he says has only one guard who could easily be

over-powered, and that, by using a two ton truck, It would

be possible to. take over a million rounds of ammo from this

location. MAYER also claims to have a .45 callber Thompson

sub-machine gun, and M-16 and N-14 rifles which he would

sell.

= NW 55009 DocId: 32989524

BILL GUIETTE, who runs the Bullseye Gun Store was

set up in that business by his father who Is a Sergeant with

the San Diego PolIce Department. GUIETTE was telling me

itoday that he was at RON ZARICK's

and while there, saw a M-14 rifle, a water-cooled .30

caliber machine gun and a BAR.

DAVIS claims that he is somewhat upset with

BARRY GODFREY, as he gave GODFREY an assignment to watch

the San Diego FBI Office to obtain information regarding

the activities of the local FBI. DAVIS said he might

use GEORGE HOOVER to stake out, the FBI Office If he Is

presently out of work on'a fake back injury. The disability

chits and this fake injury were signed by Dr. DUNKLEY

in El Cajon, who has agreed to take care of any MM or other

right wing indlvidual wounded in a confrontation the Left

or with law enforcement agencies without filing the

necessary reports and without charging a fee. HOOVER is

suppose to go back to work Monday. DAVIS says he has another.

man (unidentifled) who has a camera with a tele-photo lense,.

who will be assigned to take photographs of various places

of Interest to DAVIS.

DAVIS claims that the Nazis want-to start conducting

raids on local Jewish synagogues and want to start looking

up. Information and planning tactics

JEROME

Soptember 9, 1971

In talking with BARRY CODFREY, I learned

of the formation of a new organization known as

the National Justice Foundation. This organization

is supposed to be a group of lawyers from the Los

Angeles and Sacramento areas whose purpose will be

to counteract the work of the ACLU.

I also learned that the groups which are

protesting the sailing af the USS Constellation

are going to set up polling booths outside various

city polling places and at other Locations in an

attempt to get people to vote on whether the USS

Constellation should sail.

I also was told that the Bishop faction

of the Nazi Party is now known as the National

Socialist American Workers Party,

and is putting

out a new newspaper named "Attack".

Apparently,

this newspaper is being published and printed at

Los Angeles, California.

GODFREY also told me he was recently

interviewed by a San Diego County Deputy Sherifi

named D. &. MARTIN, regarding GODFREY's involvement

in Minuteman and other right wing activities.

MARTIN was apparently under the impression that

GODFREY was one of the leaders of these activities

and would be able to furnish much information as to

names, addresses, and activities of other people who

are involved.

GODFREY denied any knowledge. whatsoever

of such activitios which caused MARTIN to become

extromely aggrivated and to make some veiled threats

against GODFREY. However, he eventually gave up and

Afterward, GODFREY discussed this matter with

DAVIS, MICK HOOVER, and a

few other people.

was their feeling that MARTIN's visit to GODFREY was

probably caused by BILl CLAY. CLAY has suddenly been

around contacting people, asking questions and trying

to find out what is going on. CLAY even made a

personal appearance at the Gunsmoke Ranch and, while

there, apparently caused some friction as HOOVER has

now been asked to leave the ranch. The questions in

## Page 533

those people's minds now is whothor CIAY has turned

informor for the Shoriff's Office and was the source

of information for MARTIN regarding GODEREY'S

activities.

It sooms that DAVIS, HOOVER, and STAN

MO DADE are now not as intorestod in the lazis

as thoy formerly were. However, they will continuo

to cooperate with that group.

DavIs appears to bo

very enthusiastic about the coning Ropublican National

Convention. He thinks that this will be his big

chance to do somothing that will be remombered in tho

world. He said he is working on plons to organizo

a series of meotings of eight to iraive people to make

plans

for and obtain pledges of financial support

for right wing harassment activities during the

convention.

JEROME

Soptember 13, 1971

I was in contact with SAM DAVIS this

norning.

Ho told me that he has joinod the Nazi

Party and that today he rented Post Orrice BoX

5791, San Diego, California, for the Nazis.

He said he has

been assigned to act as a storm

Trooper

group leader in the San Diego area and has

begun actively organizing for the Nazis.

He explained that he went to see SCOrT

WINCHESTER at Torrance, California, yesterday.

He said he met WINCHESTER at a place named The

Bavarian Alpine Village where WINCHESTER'S grOUP

has relocated. He said that the activities of

WINCHESTER's group are very open and that there was

a lot of Nazi literature and posters in plain view.

He said he observed many people giving the Nazi

Balute and handing SCOTT WINCHESTER money.

DAVIS said there were several thousand

people present at The Bavarian Alpine Village with

hundreds of them dancing around outside the Nazi

Party headquarters

He said the crowd included

many Lithuanians,

Estchians, and Arabs, as well as

Germans, most of whom appears to be pro- Nazi. DAVIS

said one Arab was introduced to him as the leader

of the Al patah Group at Los Angeles. He said that

another person who was introduced to him claimed to have

worked for the HITLER Youth ss and was wearing a gold

SS ring. DAVIS himself is now wearing a silver sS ring.

• I also learned that GERALD I, SMITH and one

of his Lleutenants went into the "Peace House" at

2143 Market Street, early last Friday afternoon to get

some of their literature.

They were dressed in fut

Nazi uniform and when they went into the house, they

found a meeting of about fifty persons in progress.:

NW 55009 DoOId: 32989524- Fage 595-

## Page 536

Their appearance in Nazi uniforms causad a great deal

of consternation among those people at the meeting.

Also, 1ù has come to my attention that.

SAM and his associates have been asked to set up

a printing press for the Nazis in Vic Walton's

guest house and have taken this request under

Lavorable consideration.

GERALD I SMITH Local Nazi Party Group,

the National Sociallst White PeOple's Party, is

aiiiliated with the same group at Los Angeles which

25 run by JOE TOMASSI. DAVIS, however, favors

the Nazi Party Group run by SCOTT WINCHESTER at

Ios Angeles, and is working with SIAN MC DADE to

engineer a switch of SMITH's group from the TOMASSI

group to the WINCHESTER group.

DAVIS said that

BIC DADE and SMITH are on very

friendly terms.

The Right Wing Activists In the San Diego

area have three printing presses.

one, which belongs

tO BETTIE HAUCHTON, is Located at the residence of

WALT and EDITH GEYER on Massachusetts Avenue in Ia Mesa.

Another, which is owned by BIll CLAY, is located at

the residence of HOHARD CLARK at Ramona, California,

and the third, which belongs to ED BOYD, TROY HAUGHTON'S

step-father, is in the possession of STAN MC DADE.

• I was in contact with SAM DAVIS yesterday

and he was

explaining to me some of the plans he

has for the new organization he is trying to

establish.

He said he wants to try and have the

application forms and some of the training matorials

prinied this weekend.

He also said he will get a new

San Diego post office box tomorrow.

There will be

two membership lists maintained which wi be

rocorded on microfilm so they will be easy to hide.

One of these lists will be kept by DAVIS and the

other will be held by BARRY GODFREY. There will be

monthly literature mallouts with DAVIS and GODFREY

responsible for the mallouts on alternate nonths..

However, the mailouts will be made from GoDFREY's

The supplies for the mailouts and other

materials are to be kept in FRANK YACOPEC's attic.

SAM said that BETTIE HAUCHTON has a large

quantity of training literature and other supplies

in her possession which he will attempt to obtain

from her. He said that AlEX (INU) of AleX Rapid

Print has agreed to donate a part of the printing

costs for this literature.

In addition, DAVIS said that when the

organization gets going specialized training tapes

will be made up for advanced trainees.

He said he

thinks that when the organization is in full swing

the literature mallouts and training aids will cost

at least $100 a month.

Early this morning's I was contacted by

SAM DAVIS who was looking for someone to help him

with a project.

I told him I had other commitments

for the day and he said he would try to find someone

alse to help him.

Later ons & talked to him again

and he told me he had wanted someone to help him to

move several hundred pounds of explosives from the

residence of one ROGER (LNU) at 2003 Dartmoor in

spring Valley, California.

DAVIS claimed thai these

explosives included INT, C-4 Plastic Explosives,

and rifle grenades. DAVIS would not even hint as to

where these explosives had been moved but did make a

statement to the effect

"some day we'll have to move

the master cache". I got the impression that HOWARD

CLARK may have been involved in this project.

understand that the individual named ROGER Lived

with a Mexican woman and several children at that

address.

I have never heard of this ROGER before

but will try to find out mora.

It has come to my attention that the

Individual I told you about proviously named

RICK BURNS, who 1s a fireman at San Diego Fire

Department Station Number 13 in La Jolla,

continues to make extremely sympathetic statements

about communism in Russia and China.

In addition,

whiLe at York, he always has

a copy of the "Door"

or the "Street Journal"

" with him.

I was also

toda that he was observed writing the name of

Dr. GEORGE ABBOTT and telephone number 488-4421

and. the name HERBERT GINDLER on the wall at the

fire station near the telophone.

I was in contact with STAN MC DADE earlier

today. He sald he has had one thousand copios of

the new membership application form for the secret

Army Organization printed up as well as a large number

of copies of letterhead stationery for the group.

"The membership initiation fees to join the organization

will be $5 and there will be a $3 per month dues

assessed for each member.

MC DADE saj0 he believes

he will join the organization.

I loarned that GEORGE HOOVER, who is out of

work, is now receiving unemployment payments. He also.

allegedly been on some of the local reservations

attempting to recruit Indians to help work in

opposition to the Leftists.

I also found out that SAM DAVIS, HOOVER

and JERRY BUSCH have been talking about committing

robbories of houses of prostitution and similar

establishments where there would be little likilhood

of the theft being reported.

The purpose of these

robberios, of course, is to obtain money to finance

right wing actlvities.

REPORT BY JEROME

October 20, 1971

•: -

Attached is a copy of the new letterhead stationery

of the Secret Army Organization (SAO).

This letterhead was

printed approximately two weeks ago along with a large

number of sheets which are information bulletins and a so-called

history of the organization.

Some stickers advertising for

support of the SAO were printed about one week later.

A11

of the printing has been done on BETTY HAUGHTON's offset

press either by her or by WALt GUYER.

In line with the decision to go ahead and set up the

SAO organization, SAM DAVIS and BARRY GODFREY have been out

contacting people in an attempt to get new recruits.

So fars.

other individuals GeORGE HOOVER and JERRY Let BUSCH,

apparently are not to know about the organization for the

time being. However, they have been asked to do some

Intelligence-type investigations and reports on some random

,Leit Wing activities which are involved in the project to

attempt to keep the USS Constellation from sailing on 11/1/71.

they nave turned in one report,

which I gather was

beautifully done, typed and dealt with the layout of the brilding

Involved,

its occupants,

the police coverage, and other areas

o1 interest..

HOOVER and

BUsCH are supposed to be busy at

the present

time on a similar report on another groups.

In addition to the individuals named above,

there are probably several other people in the San Diego

area who would be supporters of, or sympathetic, to the

SAl who have not yet been officially contacted.

As previously reported, SAM DAVIS and GEORGE

HOOVER and STAN MC DADE were very much interested in joining

the local Nazi group, the National Socialist White Peoples

sarty (NSWIP). however, they recently discovered that the

official Nazi Party policy is very much anti-American Indiar

and they

• are now very disenchanted with the Nazis as DAVIS 1S

one-quarter Indian and HOOVER is one-half Indian.

In addition,

this policy has cost GERALD L. SMITH one of his best

lieutenants (name not known). This person was living with

a girl who is part Indian and when SMITH ordered him to

stop seeing her, he leit the organization instead. It is

possible that he may join the SAO.

This interesting turn of events may have been

one the important factors which caused DAVIS to try and get

the sao off the ground.

Many of the SAO organizational histories and news

bulletin sheets have been sent out and are being sent out to

other people who have been known in the past to be Right

Wing sympathizers.

Those individuals from the San Diego area known to

be Right Wing sympathizers who attended the recent gun show

at Juda, Arizona, included the following:

somewhere in Nevada and he had been forced to hire san eone

"to bring him on to the gun show.

After the show, he rode

back to the location of his automobile with SAM DAVIS.

ANDERSON brought with

him to the gun show a

number of U.S. Navy survival kits, some Army sleeping bags,

an AR 180 rifle in a 223 caliber

and some miscellaneous gun

parts for the KARNEs of AR sales at Los Angeles, California,

who were also at the show. ANDERSON appeared to be good

Iriends of the KARNES.

While at the gun show, ANDERSON was overheard to state

that his group had recently lost 5,000 feet of primacord and

10 machine guns in a raid by the ATFD on a friend's house.

ANDERSON said he was not too concerned about the machine

guns but he really hated to lose all of that Primacora.

It was learned that ANDERSON supposedly has a blaster's

permit with which he can obtain most of the comercially

available explosives that he wants. ANDERSON said he was

going to stay in the sathwest party of the country for about

two weeks to make contact with people he knows.

He said the

last week of this two-week period would be spent in San Diego

helping to get the SAO started.

In addition, he indicated he probably would return

to the San Diego area in about two months at which time he

would bring more weapons to sell.

organizing and contacting people than he had

expected to.

It dooks as

people he met at Las Vegas will bo joining the

SAO group. Ihis morning, we are supposed to go

to all of the post office boxes and see if there

has been any response to the mailing out of the

first literature on the SAO. We also are going

to order insignia patches to be sewn on the berets

that SAO members will wear. These patches will be

obtained through CY ANDERSON at Seattle, Washington.

SAM also wants to start work on organizing some

urban Guerilla warfare squads. He said he wants

*o form those squads with six men to a squad. and

two cars to a squad.

I also learned from him that there will be

I am also supposed to go with GEORGE HOOVER

this afternoon to help him begin recruiting his

He said that the Nazi

Ho said some

of the things that have been considered are

this incident from the White Power

take place the previous day. HOOVER was also talking

about trying to get some members of the Chinese-American

Association down to help.

HOOVER and STAN MC DADE are presently on

a religious organization kick and are associated with

the Missionary. Church of Jesus Christ run by Reverend

GALE at Los Angeles. They have acquired some fancy

blue uniforms to go along with their involvement in

this group.

He claimed that he had some explosives

he wanted to sell and asked if I was interested.

I also understand that there were some spies,

probably GEORGE HOOVER and JERRY BUSCH, watching

ROD BURTON's house at 1511 29th Street, yesterday.

Apparently, some kind of meting was taking place

there and

one man had been stationed out front as

a watchman.

residence.

ANDERSON, W1l] be at SAM DAVIS' house tomorrow.

It is my understanding that ANDERSON was originally

introduced to DAVIS by TROY HAUGHION. Furthermore,

I was told that SAM DAVIS met TOM FORREST through

CY ANDERSON. It Looks as though ANDERSON may be

one of the biggest right wing operators and dealers

In firearms in the west.

The trip which ANDERSON

made to Texas actually took him to El Paso. He

apparontly made contact there witi several individuals

November 4, 1971

& have learned from GEORGE HOOVER, STAN

MC DADE, and JERRY BUSCH attended a meeting of

GERALD L. SMITH'S Nazi Group last night.

AS I

mentioned before, HOOVER has become involved in

the activities of a semi-roligious group named

the Missionary Church of Jesus Christ.

This group

is run by a Reverend GALE at Los Angeles, Callfornia.

GALE claims to be a retired Colonel and a former aid

to General MC ARTHUR. GALE comes from Los Angeles

to San Diogo to speak approximately once a month.

He is very anti-semitic and has Nazi tendencies

although I doubt he belongs to any Nazi organization.

HOOVER is in the process of trying to got himsolf

ordained as a minister of this church.

Ho has made

himself up a fancy blue uniform which

he wore to the

Nazi Party meeting and, apparently, so impressed.

The other members of the group at the meeting, that

many of them wanted to join HOOVER's group, as he

had a better uniform than the Nazi uniform.

This has

apparently caused SMITH a great deal of consternation

and he is now busily trying to re organize his group.

I-went by the "Peace House" last night and

took a peek through the windows.

No one seemed to bo

home and I observed the house to be stacked full of

iterature and other printed materials.

November 9, 1971

The SAO has received its first response

from the mallouts which were made in October.

this came from an individual named CHARLES MANLEVE,

2938 North Seventeon Drive, Phoenix, Arizona, 85015.

MANLEVE wrote his letter about two weeks ago expressing

Interest in the SAO and requesting more Information

about it.

Incidentally, we are about to lose BILL

CLay's old post office box at the Grossmont Post

Office Station. The building where the station is

located is to ba torn down and the post office boxes

are to be vacated by the 2oth of this month. It would

be helpful to obtain another post office box somewhere

else In CLAY's name to facilitate. the forwarding of

mails.

In talking with STAN MC DADE, I have learned

that MICKEY BURTON WAKEFIELD is no longer associated

with SMITH's Nazi group.

WAKEFIELD is oither married

to or has been living with a Mexican girl. The

official Nazi. Party policy is that people with American

Indian blood, including Mexicans, are an Inferior race

and therefore Nazi Party members

should have nothing

to do with them.

I understand that WAKEFIELD was ordered

to dump the girl he was llving with because of this

policy, but refused to do so. Consequently, he

either

quit or was thrown out of the Nazi Party by, SMITH.

MC DADE claimed that this same attitude on the

part of the Nazis toward people with Indian blood as

well as some other things which have happened has cost

SMITH most of the membership of his group. MC DADE

said that many of the Nazi Party members had Mexican

wives or girlfriends and that SMITH has been tolling

the members to get rid of them which has created hard

feelings.

I was also talking wiüh FRANK YACOPEC and

from him learned that his friend, ROBERT MAYER, 1s

quite knowledgeable about radio communications. MAYER

has been investigating the broadcasting seù up of radio

NW 55009 DocId: 32989524 Page 565

---

## Page 566

station KSON.

Apparently this station has its

broadcast antenna located at some distance from the

radio station itself.

It has a repeater and

amplifler arrangement at the antenna to pick up,

amplily, and re-broadcast the relativoly weak

signal which comes from the radio station. Because

of this set up, MAYER claims that with the proper

ham radio equipment in a truck or car, most of which

he already has: 1t would be possible for a right wing.

group to drive this vehicle In the vicinity of SON's

broadcast antenna, jam the signal from the base

station, and put out its own fifteen minutes propaganda

tape using KSON's broadcast antenna. YACOPEC and

MAYER said they are going to work at setting up the

! necessary equipment to do this.

I have also been talking with SAM DAVIS.

He told me. that he and CY ANDERSON have made

tentative plans for a trip which will start about

December 1, 1971.

If the trip 1s made, DAVIS. and

ANDERSON will meet in San Diego and from there go to

Phoenix, Arizona, where they will leave SAM's car.

They will then go on to Juarez and Mexico City,

Mexico.

After returning from Mexico, they will then

travel to Denver, Colorado, and also

to places in the

state of Montana, with the fellow from Las Vegas,

Novada, named ED (LNU).

The whole trip is to take

two or

three weeks and will be made for the purpose

of making contacts in the various cities visited with

people who are known to them as Right Wing Extremists

on dealers in firearms, ammunition, and other equipment.

STAN MC DADE iS a very miserable and

bitter individual.

He has a strongly anti-semitic

attitude, and blames the U.S. Government and

Jewish business people for him being out of work

and scraping bottom.

He also claims that he has

lost all of his frionds because of his association

with

1 Che Nazi Party.

MC DADE is a former merchant ship captaln

and still holds his masters papers. At one time he

also had a large boat and & good boat yard too, but

blames Jewish bankers for the loss of these and

also for the fact that he cannot get a new business

going.

However, all he dreams about is going to

sea again and getting away from the life on shore.

He said he has been offered an eighteen-month contract

to sail a ship but thinks he ought to stay homa in

order to be able to shoot Jews.

He said he only stays

with his wife because of the children they have but

he does not care much for them either.

At one time, MC DADE supposedly was arrested

and convicted on a charge of illegal possession of a

machino gun.. Allogedly, he received a presidential

pardon in this connection. He said he thinks that the

right wing cause is hopelessly lost and he is so miserable

in his life that he actually hopes for a confrontation

with the police or with the FBI so that he can end It

all in a big shoot out.

November 22: 1971

I was talking to SAM DAVIS and BARRY GODFREY

at GODFREY's house. last night. SAM was asking if we

knew where he could find a two and one hali pound

block of co plastic explosives, a one-hundred foot

roll of fuse, and some fuse-type blasting caps.

said he wanted them for the night of November 22, 1971,

but did not say what for. Most likely, he only wants

to sell them to someone.

Ho also asked GODFREY 1f he

could provide him with armed cover for the night of

November 22, 1971, beginning at about 7:00 p.m. He

said. he would have to work late as he is building a:

Lonce for the Balboa Fence Company at the Rincon,

somewhere near Santa Barbara.

GODFREY hedged about

going along with DAVIS and said he did not know if he

could arrange it. DAVIS then said not to worry about

it as ho could easily get someone else.

Last Sunday, SAM DAVIS, ROGER DRAPEAU,

BARRY GODFREY, and STAN MC DADE and his two sons;

BRENT and MARK, went out to the desert in DRAPEAU'S

Van. SAM DAVIS had obtained some maps from BEITIE

HAUGHTON, which allegedly showed the locations of

SOme Of TROY HAUGHTON's caches of arms, ammunition

and other equipment. The particular map that was

Sunday, was hard to read; however, It is believed that

the place marked on the map was actually located. The

story regarding this particular cache is that several

years ago TRoY HAUGHTON and some of his companions

went on a week long manouver in the desert near the

Banner Grade east of Julian, California: During this

week of maneuvers, they supposedly built a cache of

weapons and ammunition on the side of a cliff near the

highway and made a map to show its location. On sunday.

we found a place where a beautiful hand laid rock wall

had been made against the side of a cliff within sight

of the Banner Grade Highway. We took the wall down and

dug back into the cliff a considerable distance but found.

nothing. It is the intention of this group to chock

this site again at a later date with a metal detector.

According to DAVIS, MOSt Of TROY HAUGHTON'S

other caches of arms and ammunition as shown on the

other maps he has are in the Needles and Rice,

California areas.

I have been in contact with SAM DAVIS.

I learned from him that CY ANDERSON resides at

10418 Northeast 168ch Place, Bothell, Washington,

and has telephone numbers 206-485-4854 and 206-454-8912.

Als wife's name is DEE.

DAVIS claims that he has already spent

$300 of his personal money on printing and materials

for the SAO. He said he is still thinking about

a trip to Phoenix, Arizona, Texas, and Mexico.

He also mentioned that JAMES EVAN POTO IS

getting ready to go to Illinois. He said POTO is

working in San Diego for a nation wide chain of

restaurants and has been asked to go to Illinois to

start a new restaurant somewhere in that state.

I have also talked to FRANK YACOPEC, Who

said he is going to take a vacation trip to Chicago,

Illinois and vicinity in December.

He said he would

drop by Norborne, Missouri, where the Minutemen

Headquarters was

located, and put SAO stickers up

all over town.

He said he and ROBERT MAYER are working at

setting up a little citizens band radio network and

will try to provide mobile units to put in the cars

of various right wingers.

These mobile units will

probably be stolen.

He said they are also working

on a code to use and are still making plans on how to

tako over radio station KSON's Broadcast Antenna in order

to play a

right wing propaganda tape.

I have learned from a contact of mine in

the telephone company that the Message Information

Center was last located at 2225 A Street, San Diego.

However, their telephone at that location was

recently disconnected for non-payment.

The loss

of the telephone service is probably the reason for

The information regarding BILl CLAY'S

involvemont in the Witches Coven on the University

of California at San Diego campus originally came

Irom SAM DAVIS and STAN MC DADE.

Ho has been in

the Witches coven for over a year now and I believe:

he is still involved with it.

Apparently, his

main interest in this group is the sexual promiscuity

of the women who are Involved.

With regard to explosives, I have no personal

knowledge of any caches buried in the desert or elsewhere

on CLAY's part, although he did claim to have made

such caches.

I have seen him in possession of metal

eans or boxes full of dynamite and other explosives

which he claimed to have dug up from such a place.

I have also known him to be in possession of other

explosives and believe he still has the rented garage

which I, at one time, observed to be chuck full of

•30 caliber carbine ammunition. In addition, SAM

DAVIS told me that at one time

he saw at Least $500

worth of gold In CLAY's garage.

The current information on CLAY is that he

is running around with FORREST (FROSTY) RODGERS.

RODGERS is the full-time west coast leader of the

JOHN BIRCH SOCiEtY.

I was told that CLAY and RODGERS

do a lot of flying together.

BETTIE HAUGHTON is doing all of the printing

for the SAl on her off set press which is now located

at WALT GUIRE's house.

She is also helping on

organizational work for the SAo and has provided

contact lists which may contain as many as 600 names

•of former contacts of TROY HAUGHTON.

Most of these

names, however, are probably just those appearing on

wailing lists rather than actual contacts.

In addition, BETTLE HAUGHTON still makes

frequent trips north to the place owned by HUGH LANCE

near Big Pine, California.

With regard to the 1972 Republican National

Convention, SAM DAVIS told me the other day that he

Is busy satting up an alibi for him to use during

the convention.

His plan is to give the impression

of being out of town during the convention by driving

his car to Arizona and pretending to stay there with

EV MOORE.

He will have MOORE cover for him as though

ke were in Phoenix when actually he will fly back to

San Diego to commit various acts of harassment,

etcetera, during the convention following which he

will fly back to Phoenix and then drive home.

Two individuals named MICHAEL BROOKS and

STEVEN O'NEIL have come to my attention. These persons

are, or were, running the SMC Organization at

Grossmont Junior College. However, BROOKS may now

be attending school at san Diego State College. BROOKS

and O'NEIL supposedly are still residing together.

This information came from-BROOKS' older brother.

December 20, 1971

By Jerome

GEORGE HOOVER was at my house this morning and

• Left with me a sample of the metal which he alleges is

stolen government gold. He said he has come to the con-

clusion that the metal must be a gold-platinum alloy because

of the high melting temperature it has.

• BARRY GODFREY told me that FRANK YACOPEC and ROBERT

MAYER went by the house at 3121 Beech Street in an attempt to

get at the printing press located there to destroy it.

Apparently, they were not able to accomplish anything there as

I have not heard of anything happening.

VACOPEC is now gone to Los Angeles, california, on

a trip following which he will travel to Gary, Indiana, to

visit with his brother. He said he will try to do some

recruiting for the SAO while there, and will

put up SAO

stickers and leaflets wherever he can.

Friday I was at SAM DAVIS' house where I observed

a letter to DAVIS frOM JESSE CLAYBURN SIEVENS.at Silver Springs,

Maryland. In the letter, SIEVENS talked of how he and his

group hated ROBERT DE PUGH and stated that he was in contact

with GLENN JACKSON and JOHN ZEMANEC of the American Volunteer

Group at Los Angeles. STEVENS, who knows SAM DAVIS Only by

the name PATRICK MC DONALD, stated that he was anxious to

get In touch with right-wing groups or individuals in the

Southern California area. He advised he had received some

SAO literature but said he corresponds with several individuals

in the san Diego area and did not know who had furnished him

with the SAO literature: (Inis was STAN MC DADE).

I also observed DAVIS' reply to STEVENS in which he

stated that the SAO was also interested in making contact with

SIEVENS' group and other similar groups in the East. He said

that the SAO remains Minuteman at heart and in principle regardless

of the name or form it might take.

The SAO has had printed 200 copies of an information

sheet on PETER BOHMER, which is to be distributed to right-wing .

activists and other individuals in the san Diego

area. The

printing was done by ALEX (INU) at Alex Rapid Print House, and

the only charge was $3.50

for the materials. So far, SAo has

spent $140 on printing its literature, most of which has come

out of the pockets of DAVIS and GODFREY. The stamps for this

SAO mail-out alone will cost $16.

ALEX of Alex Rapid Print 1s a former Minuteman who

allowed TROY HAUGHTON to do all of the West Coast Minuteman

print work on his equipment. He has now agreed to do all of the

SAo printing work at cost.

"While I was at work the other day, a colored

individual came in to report a leak in a water main. He

was driving an old pickup truck with California license

M3O319 and was wearing a chrome-plated Nazi helmet with an

American flag painted on it. I don't know what significance

this might have.

With regard to the Nazis, I have learned that their

new headquarters is located at 7720 University in La Mesa and

Is called the White Power Information Center.

I also understand that the SAO may attempt to run a

poster campaign on Camp Pendleton as there are suppose to be a

Iot of good recruit possibilities there.

I was in contact with SAM DAVIS yesterday.

He told me that BETTIE HAUGHTON told him she has decided

to remarry soon, probably about June, 1972. DAVIS did

not tell me the name of the person she is to marry but

identified him as the new owner of the Lodge at Big Pine

or lone Pine, California, which formerly belonged to

HUGH LANCE. DAVIS said that apparently LANCE is now a

Deputy Sheriff in Inyo County.

RON ZARICK told me yesterday that he has been

fired from the last job he had.

I do not know the person named ED CARVILLE who

received

one of the SAO bulletins one PETER GEORGE BOHMER.

Apparently he was just on the membership list which the SAO

got from BETTIE.

I received a telephone call last night from LYLE

MANNING at Richfield, Utah. He has telephone number 801-896-

5262, and gave me his address as Post Office Box 412, Richfield,

Utah. He told me he is now employed taking care of the fair

grounds and race track at Richfield. MANNING claimed that he

and "DOC" ROBERIS are trying to form a right-ving activist

group at Richfield and asked me to send him all the Minuteman

literature that I could get for him. He also indicated

that he and ROBERTS will be visiting the San Diego areạ

about the middle of January, 1972. He said the purpose of

their trip will be to obtain all the .30-06 and .308 caliber

ammunition that they can find. He asked me to start looking

around for this ammunition for him.

I visited TOM FORREST's place last night and learned

that somehow he is obtaining a large number of the top halves

for M-16. rifle receivers. Apparently the only real difference

between the M-15 rifle, which is semi-aucomatic, and the M-16

rifle, which is fully automatic, lies in be top half of the

receivers. He claims to have no trouble selling all these

items that he can get ahold of and he must have a good source

for suchweapon parts.

BARRY GODFREY told me that SAM DAVIS has received

more correspondence from JESSE CLAYBURN STEVENS from Silver

Springs, Maryland. In his letters STEVENS agreed to the

formation of an alliance between the SAO and his group.

According to the guidelines which were set up, STEVENS' grOup

will have control over right-wing activities in the east and

in the south while the SAO will control all activities in the

western and northern states. Both groups will work at trying

to-find and establishing a coordinate at or near Chicago,

Illinois, to handle all activities in the mid-west area.

GEDFREY said that a good possibility for this job would be

JIM POTO. He pointed out that POTO works for a national

restaurant chain, possibly Howard Johnson in San Diego, as

a restaurant manager. POTO has indicated that he expects to be

transferred in the near future to the Chicago area to open a

new restaurant and if so, he would make an ideal coordinator

for the mid-west group.

• In addition, arrangements were made in the letters

from STEVENS to trade information between the two groups on people

of interests to them who reside in each others areas.

•In

other words, if the SAO has information on a prospective

right-wing contact or other such person residing in the

area controlled by STEVENS' group, this information would be

sent to this group and vice versa.

## Page 589

• Furthermore an agreement was made to transfer

members of the SAO and STEVENS' group who move from one

area to another.

STEVENS advised that his group has micro-filming

equipment in it's possession. GODFREY claimed that the

SAO will also obtain such equipment as soon as it possibly

can and in the future, all "secure" messages between the two

groups vill be transmitted by micro-film.

In addition, STEVENS claimed that his group is

very much opposed to ROBERT BOLIVAR DE PUGH and claimed to

have information pertaining to TROY HAUCHTON's death; indicating

he may know someone who was involved in his murder. He indicated

that he would communicate with the SAO on this matter later

on. GODFREY said in his letters, STEVENS indicated he is very.

anti-police, FBI and informers. He said if he could he would

Kill them all, drop them in a hole in the desert and pore

lye on them. STEVENS offered to travel to San Diego to visit

with leaders of the SA0 and arrangements have been made.

GODFREY said that DAVIS has been working hard

on the next bulletin of the SAO and now has it ready to go

to the printers. This bulltin will be ten pages long

• and wi l1

consist of eight pages of technical information pertaining

to explosives, booby traps, and other similar items. The

other two pages will contain general information relating

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RECALLED FROM MY VISIT

WITH GERALD SMITH OF THE NSWPP.

He always goes armed to the NSWPP meetings as do

all members of the group. I suspect that these people are

generally armed at all times. However SMITH indicated to

me that he and the NSWPP do not believe in violent armed

revolutions at this time.

He explained this position by stating that he believes

that there really are no such things as political questions or

issues.

He said he believes the basis for all such political

questions and issues actually lies in racial concerns. He

said because of this he feels that eventually the people in the

United States will become fed up with racially oriented oppressions

and will vote the NSWPP into power at the polls, hence no need

for a revolution.

SMITH has a weird appearance and is not physically

tough looking as you might expect a Nazi to be.

BOB MAYER is now living at 2204 Mt. Clair Street,

San Diego, California and has telephone number

NW 55009 DocId: 32989524

## Page 593

284-3697. The house at this address was purchased by him

from CHUCK SPERRY,

the local leader of the John Barch Society.

As you will remember MAYER is supposed to marry SPERRY's

daughter soon. MAYER, who was formerly a Marine,

spent

some time in Vietnam and claims to have been wounded there.

The other person referred to is CHUCK PEARCE. He

is a member of the Army's Special Forces Unit in San Diego.

With regard to the two Nazi factions at Los Angeles

I have heard that JOE TOMASI claims that SCOTT WINCHESTER'S

group is defunct, however WINCHESTER claims his group isstill

going and is the most active.

November 5, 1971

I was talking with SAM DAVIS this morning.

and he told me that SCOTT WINCHESTER'S Nazi Group

at Los Angeles has folded up. He said WINCHESTER

apparently did not think his group was doing anything

worthwhile. I am supposed to meet with DAVIS

tomorrow to discuss our strategy with regard to

WINCHESTER and his group. DAVIS wants me to go with

him to Los Angeles next Saturday to talk with WINCHESTER

as it appears that WINCHESTER and the supporters he

has left may now be ready to join the SAo.

I was also by the old address of the Message

Information Center earlier today. It 100ks to me as

though the Message Information Center may have moved

as the building where it used to be is now being

remodeled into a very plush office space.

I was also talking to STAN MC DADE who told

me he had received in the mall a brand new issue of

"On Target" which came from Maryland and which claimed

to be the place of the Minuteman Organization. I will

attempt to obtain the publication from him.

He said

he has no idea as to how the publishers of the paper

might have obtained his name and address, although he

said he did write to a gun parts shop in

Maryland

approximately one week before he received the paper.

It has come to my attention that JERRY LEE BUSCH,

GEORGE HOOVER, and one or two of their friends have been

present at the protest demonstrations sponsored by the

supporters of PETER BOHMER. Apparently, they were taking

photographs and gathering other information for the use of.

SAO.

The SAO, by the way, wants to put out a counter-

intelligence type bulletin on BOHMER for the purpose of

Informing right wing activists in this area as to what is

going on with regard to BOHMER, and also to create a stir

and cause some concern for their safety among the left wing

activists.

It has come to my attention by way of RON ZARICk,

who I talked to yesterday, that there is an individual named

SCOTTIE SCHULIZ in the area. SCHULTZ is known to be an informer

for ATFD and is believed to have been responsible for setting

up the arrest and conviction of BUD KITCHENS. He has been

• gone from the San Diego area for a considerable period of time

but is back nosing around again. ZARICK said there seems to

be particular interest in JOHN BUSH on the part of ATFD and

ZARICK feels BUSH may be the next one to be arrested.

I had a conversation with TOM FORREST yeste day.

He said he had received information that there is a

ATFD

Informant working in this area again and he wanted to make

sure that everyone was alerted. He said this individual is

named (FNU) IARKIN, Is about 50 years old, 5'8" tall, 150

pounds, with short red hair and a red complexion. Apparently

ATFD has attempted to use this Individual in the san Diego

area on previous occasions. I was told that LARKIN was trying

to sell 40 machine guns to SAM DAVIS.

SAM DAVIS and STAN MC DADE are attempting to raise

enough money to open a gun shop In this area which will be

called the "Minuteman Armory".

Along the same line, BILI GUIETIE of Bullseye Gun

Shop; CHUCK PEARCE of the John Birch Society; and BARRY GODFREY

of the SAO, are to get together and set up an ammunition dump

somewhere in the desert.

They have also discovered that receivers for light

•30 caliber machine guns can be easily manufactured with a

regular milling machine from flat pieces of steel which are then

welded together. The "Minuteman Armory" may Involve Itself in

manufacturing some of these receivers.

I was in contact with GEORGE HOOVER yesterday.

He claimed that he,

in turn, is in contact with some

Individuals, whose identities he did not even hint at,

who claim to have possession of a large quantity of stolen

U.S. goverment gold.

According to HOOVER, this gold is in a 55 gallon

drum and must weigh close to 1,000 pounds. He said the gold,

of which he has a sample, is in small pieces which have the

appearance of having been melted. HOOVER said he has been

asked by

these other individuals to help sell the gold. He

said the idea is to package it in ten or twenty pound lots

but did not know what the asking price would be. He said he

would furnish me a sample of this material tomorrow, which

I could take to PAUL RUPLINGER or some other place and have

analyzed. He said the people selling the gold will want as

much for it as they can get.

HOOVER, himself, continues to

reside in housing

furnished for him at the wood. King Wood. Yards on Magnolia

near Santee. He is currently employed making deliveries

of

NW 55009 Docid: 32989524 Page 602

---

## Page 603

wood for the wood yards, receiving $5 per delivery. He

claims to be making six to eight deliveries a day.

With regard to DON CAREY, It has come to my

attention that he has recently been spreading rumors designed

to place JERRY GEIER, BARRY GODFREY, and others in a bad light

with other right-wing activists. However, most people who

Know CAREY do not pay much attention to him as It 1s generally

held that he is "nuts" and is really flipping out. I do not

think CAREY is currently employed. He is described as follows:

Race

Age

Sex

Height

Weighe

Build

Hair

White

Approximately 40 (looks younger)

Male

517" - 518".

150 pounds

Wiry

Very dark colored

He resides with his mother, JEANETIE WORDELL, at 4069.

El Ca jon Boulevard, where he has telephone number 284-7807. He

also claims to have a place at campo for use as a hide-out if

necessary. To the best of my recollection, he drives a gray

Jeep-type Toyota vehicle.

Last night I was at JERRY GEIER's house.

The con-

versation got around to the theft, some time ago, of weapons

from the ROTC

• Armory at Sweetwater High School. GEIER said

that the evening before the theft, he received a telephone call

from a friend (unnamed) who asked him if he wanted some BAR's

and other similar weapons, to which GEIER replied that he did.

His friend said he had a line on a supply of such weapons and

that they would be available the following night. GEIER said

that on the next night he and his friend went to a pre-arranged

location, picked the weapons up and brought them back to GEIER's

residence where they were stored in the garage. According to .

GEIER, the following morning when he went to work, a fellow

employee jokingly asked him if he had purchased any machine guns.

GEIER said "What do you mean?", whereupon the other individual

pointed out to him an article in the paper regarding the theft

of weapons from the Sweetwater High School ROIC Armory. GETER

said he checked the list of weapons reported to have been stolen

against those he had purchased the previous evening and found it

to match exactly. He said he immediately dashed home, wiped all

the weapons down for fingerprints, and returned them to the source

from which they had been obtained. However, neither he nor his

friend received any money back that they had already paid for

the weapons.

GEIER said that the source of the weapons was the son

of the Army Sergeant regularly assigned to the ROTC Unit at

Sweetwater High School. He said this individual apparently backed

NW 55009 DocId: 32989524

Page 604

## Page 605

a truck into the wall of the room containing the ROIC weapons,

breaking a large hole through the which the weapons were loaded

into the truck. GEIER said that after the weapons

were returned

to the Army Sergeant's son, he took them to the singing Hills

Golf Course where they were later found laying on the grass.

Word has come to me from STAN MC DADE that WILLIAM

WEATHERRY has either quit or been dropped from the NSWPP. He

may be the Lieutenant of GERALD I. SMITH who quit when ordered

by SMITH to leave his Mexican wife. I understand that GEORGE:

HOOVER is working to recruit WEATHERBY for the SAO.

It has also come to my attention that the NSWPP has

opened a formal headquarters and office space either on University

or El Cajon Boulevard in La Mesa. The rent for this space is

$125 per month, and I believe is being financed primarily by

VIC WALTON and/or JOE BRINKER.

I have also heard that BARRY GODFREY will be working

with STAN MC DADE and GEORGE HOOVER to compile a list of the

local NSWPP members.

I don't know how many members may be left

following the recent shake-up in that organization.

Last night I went to the NSWPP White Power

"Information Center located at 7720 University, La Mesa,

California and spoke with GERALD SMITH, using an assumed

name. This is the first time that I have talked with SMITH

and I found him to be very egotistical, highly talkative

and very much down on the Minuteman organization and related

right-wing activities. He claimed to know all of the Minuteman

leaders and indicated that he and his group went on maneuvers

with the Minuteman organization all the time. He stated

that he thinks the Minuteman organization is comprised

of a bunch of cowards who will not do anything to protect

the country when the time comes. He impressed me as being

really "nuts".

SMITH mentioned VIC WALTON as one of the backers

of the NSUPP and hinted that most of the financing for his

gup comes from out-of-state. He said that his plans for the

1972 Replubican National Convention will include picketing

of both the Republican and Left Wing groups.

According to SMITH, the NSWPP holds a meeting

each Wednesday night at 7:30 PM which is open to the public.

NN 55009 DocId: 32989524 Page 607

---

## Page 608

This White Power Information Center is open on

Tuesday, Thursday and Friday evenings from 6:00 to 8:30 PM

and on Saturday afternoons.

He said the NSWPP rented the space for the

White Power Information Center under the ruse that it

was to be used for a book store, otherwise the group either

would already have been evicted or never would have been rented

the space in the first place.

While he was there, there was another strange looking

young male individual with SMITH who he believed was named

RAY WILLIAMS or WILSON. He was described as follows:

Race

Height

Weight

Hair

Complexion

Build

Eyes

DreSS

White

5'6"

130-135 pounds

Blond

Pale

Slender

Blue

Wearing skin-tight pants and an

Eisenhower jacket with a swastika

on be colar.

I have heard that GEORGE HOOVER is attempting to

wean

this person away from SMITH.

In addition, from their conversation it appears

that the NSWPP is down on STAN MC DADE.

I do not know of the individual named STEVEN

LINN CROPSEY or anything about his involvement in the

I was in contact with SAM DAVIS who is in the

process of making up a master file on right-wing activities.

Hopefully I will have access to this information.

DAVIS also advised that the new ten page SAO

bulletin has been printed and should be out tomorrow.

He stated that he is anxiousto start preparing another

special intelligence bulletin to be put out by the SAO.

This time he wants the target of the bulletin to be some

nationally known figure in the new left, such as JERRY RUBEN,

WILLIAM RUNSTLER OF ABBIE HOFFMAN.

BY JERONE

I learned last night from BOB MAYER that he, SAM

DAVIS, and BARRY GODFREY were at San Diego State College (SDSC)

yesterday putting up SAO stickers, particularly around the

office of ProfeSSor PETER BoHMeR.

I understand that in the evening some harassing

telaphone calls were made by SAO members to the residence of

Professor BOHMER.

SAM LAVIS brought to my attention the fact that

CY ANDIRSON is suppose to be in town from Seattle, Washington,

next week. DAVIS said that ANDERSON is going to bring a

large quantity of stuff to sell, including the following:

Military mountain style mummy sleeping bags at

three fof fifty dollars

New military field jackets with hoods at eleven

dollars each and without hoods, nine dollars each

Parachute rifle grenades at two dollars a piece

or six for ten dollars.

Military brass and steel cleaning rods

Two new AR-180's at $210.00 each.

One used AR-14 at $225.00.

One used high stand .22 caliber pistol at

seventy dollars

One used Colt Diamond Back . 38 caliber pistol

at $90.00.

ferome.

One used M-1 carbine at seventy dollars.

One used M-2 carbine at one hundred thifty

five dollars.

One used 1903 Springfield at sixty five

dollars.

One used Model 97 Winchester Riot Gun at

eighty five dollars.

DAVIS claims he has also contacted some acquaintances

of his in Kansas and Oklahoma regarding establishing the

SAO in those area. He further claimed to have recruited

two unidentified individuals at Carson near Los Angeles,

California, into the SAO. He also advised he has received

letters of inquiry regarding the SAO from the Redding,

California, area, and from some where in the State of Maryland.

Yesterday BOB MAYER, STAN MC DADE, SAM DAVIS, NICK

• HOOVER, FRANK YACOPIC, "FAT JOHN" LENNOX (who has telephone

number 284-1442) and LENNOX's shadow, a kid named DENNIS

(LAST NAME UNKNOVY), were all at BARRY GODFREY'S house dis-

cussing the shooting of a girl at Professor BOHMER'S house

and the implication that the SAO was responsible or at least

involved. All those present were expecting to be interviewed

regarding the shooting, and were bragging about what they

were going to do when the police came to call. As usual,

YACOPEC and MAYER were all excited about pulling off some

big stunt.

DAVIS said he had been talking to BETTIE HAUGHTON,

and according to her, the newspaper publicity which the SAO

got in connection with the shooting incident, has stirred

up a lot of interest among the Right Wing oriented individuals

she knows. She told DAVIS she had received 25 to 30 contacts

from people who formerly belonged to the Minutemen (MM)

Organization who she said were interested in Joining the SAO.

She also told DAVIS she had showed some of the SAO literature

to HUGH LANCE, who is suppose to be a Deputy Sheriff at either

NW 55009 Docid: 32989524 Page 614

## Page 615

Big Pine or Long Pine, California. She said he was very

enthusiastic about the SAO and might join. DAVIS said

we will have to make arrangements to contact him.

DAVIS mentioned he has another new SAO contact

somewhere in the Los Angeles, California, area.

STAN MC DADE claimed to have received a telephone

call from TOM DRISCOLL, a Customs Inspector at the Border at

San Ysidro, California. DRISCOLL apparently asked MC DADE

if he knew where DRISCOLL.could pirchase several machine

guns. MC DADE said he once sold DRISCOLL a light point

.30 caliber machine gun.

DAVIS said again that CY ANDIRSON is suppose to be

• down in the San Diego, California, area, sometime in the near

future. DAVIS said ANDERSON had been talking about going to

the Mardi Gras in New Orleans and wants DAVIS to go with

him. However, DAVIS probably will not be able to as he is

currently on unemployment.

The following are San Diego, California, area,

members of the SAO who are known to me:

JERRY LYNN DAVIS

STANLEY DON MC DADE

GEORGE M. HOOVER

JAMES EVAN POTO.

HOWARD BARRY GODFREY

FRANK YACOPEC

ROBERT S. MAYER

PAUL RUPLINGER

In addition, I believe that one AL RUPP, a Close

personal friend of DAVIS, may also be sort of a hip pocket

member of the SAO.

Specific members and supporters of the SAO include

HOWARD FRANCIS CLARK, who has been

given

a membership application

form which he has not returned yet, and ED ANDREWS, who has

been contributing finances to the SAO, but says he is not

ready to become a member yet. ANDREWS talks about returning.

to the state of Arkansas, in the not too distant future, and

has indicated he might be agreeable to doing some recruiting

_and organizing work there for the SAo.

NW 55009 DocId: 32989524

## Page 618

BETTIE HAUGHTON has been doing some of the

organizational and printing work for the SAO. She has an

off-set press which is located in the garage of the house

belonging to WALT and EDITH GUTRE located at 4114 Massachusetts,

La Mesa, California. The GUIREs are former Mi sympathizers,

and are close friends of BETTIE HAUGHTON.

About December 29, 1971, the GUIREs agreed to do some

research work for the SAO:

In addition, DAVIS said that WALT HAYWARD wrote

to him recently about the SAO Offering to help in any way he .

can. However, he claimed he has been out of work for awhile

and is short of money. Furthermore, SAM mentioned he would

like to take BARRY GODFREY and pay a call to LOU CONDE to ask

him for donations and other assistance for the SAO.

SAM said that SCOTT WINCHESTER, leader of the

National Socialist American Workers Party, faction of the

Nazi Group at Los Angeles, California, is to be in town

tomorrow, January 15, 1972. Apparently the purpose of his.

visit will be to discuss the possibility of setting up some

kind of a quasi alliance between the SAO and the NSAWP. •

The name GENE BOZARTH has come to my attention as

a likely source of good information regarding Left Wing

activities on the San Diego State College (SDSC) campus.

BOZARTH, who is suppose to be a State College student,

lives at 6979 Galewood, and has telephone number 583-8219,

and a mailing address of Post Office Box 1566, San Diego,

California.

When I was at DAVIS' house last night, talking

about the visit of WINCHESTER to San Diego, California, AL

RUPP was there, which kind of put the dampers on the discussion.

Last night BARRY GODFREY told that earlier in the

day two San Diego, California, Police Department, detectives

had core to his house questioning him about the shooting

incident at the residence of Professor PETER BOHNER on

January 6, 1972. GODFREY said the detectives names, SANDERS

and SHIVELY, came on very strong as though GODFREY was a self-

admitted member of the SAQ. They asked what he knew about

the shooting incident and whether the SAO had been involved.

He told them he did not know anything about the shooting

except when he had read the paper, and he did not elaborate

on the SAO. They then asked him whether he had any 9 mm.

weapons to which he replied he did not and that he did not like

that caliber. Following that, they asked him if he knew anyone

in the SAO who had anything to do with the incident and GODFREY

said that he did not. The detectives then said the shooting

incident was a very bad deal, and GODFREY agreed with them

stating it was very unprofessional and that if someone had

really wanted to do something to Professor BOHNER, they could

have easily taken the front half of his building off.

GODFREY said the detectives were somewhat interested

in his automobile, and explained to him that they had pre-

viously observed him visiting at the residence of JERRY LYNN

DAVIS.

Last evening BARRY GODFREY told me that SAM DAVIS

had been interviewed by the same two detectives who talked

to GODFREY the day before. He said they asked SAM if he was

a member of the SAO and he said he was. They then asked him

if he was responsible for the shooting incident at Professor

BOTHER's house or if he knew of anyone who was involved in

the incident to which DAVIS replied no. He then told the

• detectives that if the SAO, as an organization, had wanted to

do something like that, Professor BOHMER would have been leveled

to the ground. They then asked DAVIS many questions about the

SAO to which he answered as truthful as he was able, and

particularly they asked if the SAO intended to put out more

bulletins similar to the one it had prepared on Professor BOHER.

DAVIS told them that the SAO did intend to print such bulletins,

which caused the detectives to ask him if the same number

of bulletins would be sent out or if more or less would be

sent. DAVIS said more and indicated that the next bulletin would

be sent to about three hundred people; the one after that to •

about five hundred people and the one after that to about

one thousand people. According to DAVIS, this caused the

detectives to become very upset and they said they did not

think sending out so many bulletins was a very good idea as

-*..

• NW 55009 DocId: 32989524

this could cause a lot of trouble for somebody.

The detectives then asked DAVIS about the weapons

which he owned and indicated they were aware that he has had

about forty hand guns registered to him, including several

9 mm. weapons. DAVIS apparently told them he does not pre-

sently own any 9 mm. weapons, and satisfactorily explained

to them the disposition of those which he once aned.

I have learned that the Bulls Eye Gun Shop in El

Cajon, California, has been closed as it was not making much

money. BILL GUIETTE, the former manager, is now hanging around

with a friend named LARRY BROWN at the Jiffy Machine Shop.

Most of the gun shop inventory, including many weapons, is now

located in GUILTTE's garage at his home.

TOM FORREST has a business establishment named

the Tom Forrest Company located in the Midway Industrial Center

on Kurtz Street just off Rosecrans. He is usually there most

afternoons and evenings.

I was at TORPEST'S place last night and learned

that he had many bi-pods fro M-14 rifles, which were probably

stolen. He said he got them from a

I Marine who had just walked

in off the street with then. Furthermore, I was digging

around in FORREST's backs room, and found there in the

neighbor-

hood of one hundred boxes of what appeared to be barrelled

M-14 actions. I opened one

of the boxes sufficiently to see

what was inside, and assumed that the rest of the boxes had

the same thing in them. In my opinion, it is likely that these

barrelled actions were suppose to have been destroyed at a

place like Iort Ord, but somehow, got into FORREST's possession

instead.

With segard to the shooting incident at Professor

BOHMER's house, FORREST said he had been contacted by two

detectives from the San Diego, California, Police Department.

Apparently SAN DAVIS once. had two 9 mm. pistols, and when he

was interviewed by the detectives, he told them he sold one

tO TOM FORREST, and the other to an individual named JACK

RICHARDS, a local "gun nut" type. FORREST said he guessed

the detectives got in touch with him to check DAVIS' story out

and verified that DAVIS did, in fact, sell him one

of the two

pistols. However, FORREST conveniently was unable to remember

What he did with the gun after he bought it.. He told me

confidentially he had sold it to a Mexican in Tijuana, Baja

California, Mexico.

FORREST said the detectives seemd to have been

convinced that the weapons used in the BOHER's shooting incident

was a Browning High Power. They also asked FORREST if he was

a member of the SAO which he denied. They then asked FORREST

if he knew whether BARRY GODFREY owned or had purchased or

sold any 9 mm. weapons, and what he usually bought from FORREST,

when he did business with him. FORREST said he told them

that GODFREY was not know to have any 9. mm. weapons and

did not particularly like them, that he preferred .45 caliber

pistols and .30 and that those were the only type he had

purchased from FORREST. The detectives then asked FORREST

whether SAM DAVIS ever came by and who with. FORREST told

55009 DooId: 32909524 Page 627

## Page 628

him he had seen DAVIS in his shop, accompanied by CY ANDERSON

and BARRY GODFREY. FORREST said he was impressed that the

detectives were very excited about the SAO and he told them

he had seen the SAO bulletin which was put out on BOrNER.

The detectives then indicated they might contact GODFREY again

and asked FORREST if he knew what shift GODFREY worked at the

Fire Department.

I also saw GEORGI HOOVER yesterday. He is still up

in the air about being interviewed by the Police Department

over the BOHMER shooting. He said if the Police Department

came to interview him, he would tell them exactly what he

thought of them. (He does not think kindly of them). He said

if the Federal Bureau of Investigation attempted to interview

him, he would simply say that he believed the FBI to be an

unconstitutional body and an agent of a foreign power and would

refuse to be interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

DAVIS clains he has obtained the keys to both the

gate and the fence as well as the door to the explosives

magazine of a sand and gravel company located on Mission Gorge

Road. He said he also has a complete inventory of the contents

of the magazine and said it appears there are enough explosives

in the magazine to fill a semi-trailer truck. He said he

has a plan, the basis of which is to go into the magazine at

night with a truck, load up as much explosives as the truck

will carry and then go out locking the door and gate behind

but leaving a time delay charge behind to blow up the

NW 55009 DocId: 32989524 Page 628

## Page 629

magazine and its contents so no one would ever know how

much, if any, of the explosives were taken. •

It should be remembered that DON CAREY was suppose

to have been a powder monkey at that location in the past,

however, DAVIS said that JIM POTO was the one who actually

came up with the keys. DAVIS did not explain how or where

POTO got them.

FRANK YACOPEC and JEORGE HOOVER have been

getting

together lately and may decide to start

working together on some of their weird projects.

As I mentioned before, the Yuma Gun Show

is coming up on the 25th, 25th & 27th of this month.

CY ANDERSON will be down from Seattle to go to the

show.

He will come to San Diego first and spend a.

few days here selling various things that he is

bringing down. SAM DAVIS and BARRY GODFREY are also

going to the gun show. It is expected that EV MOORE

will be there from Phoenix, and that there will be

organizational meetings of

the SAO during the gun show.

PAUL RUPLINGER has already put: in an order

for $800 worth of the sturf which CY ANDERSON iS

bringing down from Seattle.

This stuff is supposed to

Include some military-type sleeping bags, rifles, ammunition,

etcatera.

The San Diego Public Library maintains a name

index on all persons whose names figure prominently

In the local newspapers.

It appears that someone has

gone through this index

and systematically removed the

names of all individuals with Left Wing connections.

RULINGER was quite upset about this and said he had a

friend he would chock with about it.

SAM DAVIS waS

3 also by the other day and said

he was looking for ten fuse-type blasting caps, but

did not say what for.

JERRY LEE BUSCH has become a pain in the nock

for the local people because of the trouble and commotion

he has caused and because of being so untrustworthy.

DAVIS

and others will make

efforts to get him to leave

town by

I was in contact with SAM DAVIS this morning.

He told me that over last weekend, the SAO had received

mail from an individual at Phoenix, Arizona, who 1s

the area

leader there of the National Socialist American

Worker's Party for SCOTT WINCHESTER at Los Angeles.

DAVIS said this individual was formerly a member of the

Minutemen Organization but had lost contact with that

group and had begun associating with the Nazi's.

In

his letter, this individual said he had heard of the

SAO and he

and his entire group were interested in

joining.

DAVIS said he had also talked to BETTIE

HAUGHTON over the weekend. She told DAVIS she had

been contacted recently by two individuals from Covina.

She described these persons as formerly trusted leaders

In the Minutemen Organization under her husband, TROy.

She said these persons were interested in joining the

SAO. One of them is supposedly moving to the State of

Oregon in the near future, and indicated he would organize

for the SAO there.

She also told DAVIS that her husband, TROY,

had once borrowed money from these individuals and

in return had given them, as security, two 91 milameter

mortars with a number of rounds of ammunition and a

case of 36 grenades. The amount of money owing on these

weapons is about $100. SAM said he might sell some of

the grenades at $10 apiece to pay off this debt. He also

claimed that he can get additional rounds for the 81

milameter mortars at $10 apiece, but did not say where or

We should be in contact with those individuals from

covina in the near future, and I will try then to learn

more about them.

It Is well known that TROY HAUGHTON had a habit

of borrowing money around from among his friends.

When. I

was last at LOU CONDE's place, I saw an I.O.U, there to

him from TRoY for $500.

## Page 639

It 1s also possible that the two individuals

from covina may know the whereabouts of the Army Field

Hospital which TROY HAUGHTON is supposed to have stashed.

DAVIS also indicated that the SAO may put out

a poüter this weekend in the form of a wanted poster

showing President NIXON to be wanted for treason in

connection with his trip to China.

I learned this morning from BARRY GODFREY

that he had been in contact with an individual named

CALVIN FOX. FOX has just recently moved to the San

Diego area from Los Angeles, and is operating a Gulf

Service Station at the corner of Mollison and Broadway

in El Cajon, California. FOX was supposedly a former

memoer of the Minutemen Organization at Los Angeles

and has Minutemen Serial Number A60065.

The A on the

serial number may mean that he was recruited by an

individual named LLOYD PULLEN. FOX claims to have been

married about four years ago to a girl from Yugoslavia

at London, England.

FOX was recommended to GODFREY by his letter

carrier, TOM OSBORNE. It appears that FOX may be the

next new member of the SAO and that OSBORNE may also

join some time in the future.

It has come to my attention that the Reverend

CARL MC INTYRE is coming to town next Wednesday, and

will speak at a rally and picket to take place in front

of the main U.S. Post Office in downtown San Diego, to

protest President NIXON's trip to China.

This appearance

LILA BUCK and others of the SCOTT Memorial Baptist Church

in San Diego.

GEORGE HOOVER claims that he got a telephone

call from either/or both the Gunsmoke Ranch and the

Fleury Ranch in Harbison Canyon, that officers from the

San Diego Police Depariment had

been there looking for

him. He said he was later interviewed at his residence

by these police officers, who told him they had received

an anonymous telephone call informing them that HOOVER

•phone call thron

was a member of the SAO, and that he had been Involved

in the shooting of PAULA THARP at the residence of PETER

BOHMER. HOOVER said he simply told them he was not a

HOOVER said he suspects that the

anonymous telephone call may have been made by DICK

DEXTRAZE who frequently hangs around the Fleury place

in Harbison Canyon.

SAM DAVIS claims there will be a meeting

tomorrow between him and BARRY GODFREY and the

two Individuals from Covina, California, to make

the transfer of the two 81 milameter mortars and

the box of hand grenades.

DAVIS said he will put up

half of the money required and wants GODFREY to come

up with the other $50.

The meeting will take place

at a "safe" house somewhere in the area at about 2:00

in the afternoon.

DAVIS will come by GoDFREY's house

and then they will go to make the meeting in GODFREY's

truck, a white Ford Shortbed Pick-up Truck, with a

camper on the back, and with California license

99704F.

After obtaining

the mortars and hand grenades,

DAVIS claims he will leave them at some other house he

has in mind.

According to DAVIS, the SAO has electéd to

go ahead with printing and putting out the wanted

posters on President NIXON. According to DAVIS, PAUL

RUPLINGER will finance the printing which will be done

by BETTIE HAUGHTON. The original plan is to contract

for 10,000 copies of the posters and to have them

distributed by CY ANDERSON in the Seattle, Washington

area; EV MOORE, at Phoenix, Arizona; LYLE MANNING, in

the State of Utah; JESSE CLAYBURN STEVENS, at Baltimore,

Maryland; and of

course all over the San Diego area.

Apparently, there was an article which appeared

In the February 9, 1972, Issue of the

Daily Aztec

which must have greatly disturbed the Left Wingers on

that campus as they went around and gathered up all the

copies of the paper they could find and then burned them.

The burning of the papers was carried on television. If

needed, I have a copy of that issue of the paper.

I understand that DAVIS received a telephone

call this morning from the two individuals at Covina,

california, who

called to say that they would not be

able to deliver the two 81 milameter mortars and the

box of hand grenades as arranged.

They explained they

had buried these itams and were unable to locate them

when they went to dig them up.

They said they would

try to get a metal detector and look for them again.

However, it appears this operation may be postponed

Ior an indefinite period of time.

The individual named DICK DEXTRAZE, who has

been staying at the Fleury Place in Harbison Canyon,

Is again suspected of being an infiltrator. GEORGE

HOOVER : fed DEXTRAZE some phony information to the

effect that local Right Wingers are maintaining a

fully armed war plane at a landing field in the San

Diego area, In less than a week, this

printed in

HOOVER and others are talking about making DEXTRAZE

the subject of an object lesson for the Left Wingers.

The President NIXON wanted posters are to go

to press today and to be on the streets Monday.

number of copies to be printed has been reduced to

5,000. The format of the posters will be as follows:

At the top will be the words Wanted for Treason,

melon mach ma Cp potence the President,

and underneath that a description including his last known

address.

At the bottom will be a suggestion that the

President be impeached and be tried for treason by the

proper authorities.

Attached

are copies of all the recent publications

and other papers of

the SAO.

I was talking with STAN MC DADE last

week. We were discussing tie situation at the

residence of RICHARD and GENEVIEVE FLEURY in

Harbison Canyon.

According to MC DADE, RICHARD

FLEURY claims that on the morning of Saturday,

2/19/72, he was walking out in his front yard

when someone shot at him four times from across

the canyon. Following this, his wife, already

upset by his friends and activities, came unglued

and hit him over the head with a lamp, following

which a big fight resulted. Sne told him that

because of his friends and activities, he was going

to get her and all of their children killed. The

Sheriff's Office was called and FLEURY moved out

and went to stay with GEORGE HOOVER at his place.

MC DADE said GENEVIEVE FLEURY later called the

Sheriff's Office and them come and pick up all of

her husband's guns including a •9 milameter pistol,

which they seemed very elated to find. MC DADA

said HOOVER and RICHARD FLEURY are blaming the

shooting incident on JERRY LEE BUSCH, and DICK

DEXTRAZE, who sometimes stays at the

FLEURY place.

When RICHARD FLEURY went cack to get his guns, he

supposedly found DEXTRAZE there with his wife.

MC DADE fears that HOOVER and FLEURY may attempt to

take some drastic action against DEXTRAZE belleving

that he has been breaking the FLEURY family up.

MC DADE said that BUSCH is apparently leaving.

for Canada today to take a job there and may be doing

so because

• HOOVER is so angry at him.

I would estimate that the SAO has received

approximately $300 to $400 now in donations, membership

application fees, and monthly dues.

SAM DAVIS has

been keeping this money and most of it has been spent

on printing and postage costs for the SAO. DAVIS

told me that DONNA LEE HARTLEY of Vista, California,

recently sent $15 into the SAO with a letter requesting

all of the SAO training literature.

Apparently, the plans which JIM POTO had

of going back to the Chicago, Illinois area to open

up a new restaurant there for the restaurant chain

he works for have not materialized. It looks as though

POTO will remain in the San Diego area for the time

being and will help BARRY GODFREY and DAVIS orgánize

for the SAo.

DAVIS has asked GODFREY to do a new

special intelligence bulletin for the SAO on some

leading figure in the New Left Movement in the San

Diego area.

I have heard no new information on the

situation at the FLEURY place in Harbison Canyon.

GODFREY DAVIS claims that an individual named

GIL ARRUDA may join the SAO in the near future and

may allow the SAO and its members to use his

for firearms practice and training purposes. ARRUDA

has about 190 acres of open land up in Wild Cat Canyon

above Lakeside. DAVIS said he has been thinking about

working out a method of moving up to this place to live

on it.

I have been given the assignment of going out

to sign up. CALVIN FOX as a member of the SAO and will

do so today.

some consideration has been given to having

GEORGE HOOVER come out in the open as a public recruiting

officer for the SAO. HOOVER claims to have heard from

SAM DAVIS called me this morning and said

he had been talking to BETTIE HAUGHTON.

Apparently,

she is about ready to leave San Diego and go up to

Big Pine, California, where she will live and

eventually be married.

According to DAVIS, BETTIE

has a miniature Minox camera, which she wanted to

sell for about $50. DAVIS said she went to a camera

store and found she could only get $30 for the Minox.

She was kind of upset about this and said she would

rather let the SAO have it for $25 for the use of the

organization. SAM and I will go by her place tomorrow

and pick it up from her. I will also find out then

exactly when she is leaving

town.

SaM said he wants me to go with him tomorrow

to see the new female SAO member at Vista, named

DONNA LEE HARTLEY.

I understand that STAN MC DADE and GEORGE

to El Monte, California, last Saturday

night to hear MATT KOEHL, National Commander of the

MC DADE also said he was going to

attend the rally at the San Diego NSWPP Headquarters

yesterday, to hear KOHL speak.

I went to see BETTIE HAUGHTON yesterday and

got the Minox camera together with four rolls of film

and three gas masks. She said she is going to leave

town within two weeks. SAM DAVIS was also with me and

she gave SAM some keys to a garagé where all of the

old Minutemen camp gear is located.

This stuff includes

cots, stoves, medical supplies, etcetera. She also

told

SaM that a large quantity of explosives is supposedly

buried under the house of VAL BOYLE, TROY HAUGHTON'S

mother.

I also understand that JIM POTO and FRED

HAWES know something about this garage and havasome

of their stuff stored there too.

HAWES used to live

with BETTIE HAUGHTON and she and JIM POTO are on very

good terms.

When SAM DAVIS and BARRY GODFREY were at the

Yuma Gun Show weekend before last, they met with EV

MOORE and discussed a few details and plans about the

SAO but nothing very extensive.

Apparently, there is

a rumor going around that ROBERT DE PUGH, former National

loader of the Minutemen Organization, may already ba

trying to make a comeback even though he is still in

prison.

This rumor is based on the fact that certain

Individuals who did a lot of work for him and for the

Ku Klux klan in the southwest are now highly placed in

the Liberty Lobby which is now setting up survival

groups and an underground organizational and communications

network. It is believed that all of this activity may

be part of plans for DE PUGH to come back and take over

again. One of the individuals involved in these activitles

18 ALICE DUNN, who was formerly in the organization named

•...

INW 55009 DocId: 32989524

Page 657

---

## Page 658

American Volunteer Groups, and also worked for

DE PUGH as a fund raiser.

At the suggestion of Ev MOORe, the new

So introduction letter and recruiting literature

will be sent out along with a coded coupon which

will have only a number rather than the reciplent's

name, for him to use to request more information if

interested in the SAO.

MOORE, who is supposed to be a master locksmith,.

indicated he would write a bulletin for the SAO on how

to jimmy doors and also, an advanced training bulletin

on locis picking and safe cracking:

BARRY GODFREY Is to be the official SAO

photographer and a part. of his duties will include

taking and editing photographs of SAO training

sessions to be used for publicity.

WALT GUIRE's name was mentioned as one

who might give propaganda lectures.

The SAO will also, in the near future, publish

a bullotin on what members

should do when they are

Interviewed by the law. This bulletin will include

suggestions such as keeping a loaded camera by the door

in order to take photographs of the interviewing officials,

obtaining the name and badge number of these officials

and make them wait while the appropriate agency is called

to verify their identity.

BETTIE HAUGHTON has said she

once caught some ATFD Agents using FBI identification in

their interviews. These procedures are also a harrassment

tactic which may hopefully frighten away less serious

minded interviewers.

GEORGE HOOVER Claims he has not filed a Federal

Income tax return for several years. It is possible that

some of the others such as DAVIS may also not have filed

returns when required. HOOVER also claims to have been

married twelve to fourteen years ago, but to have separated

from his wife after living together for only a short while.

HOOVER and DAVIS have known each other for approximately

ten years.

JANUARY 28, 1972

I was told by BARRY GODFREY that he and SAM DAVIS

went to see LOU CONDE this morning to ask him to help finance

some of the SAO's activities. When contacted, CONDE donated

a complete "Angry Thirteen" military radio set to the SAO

together with all of the antennas, crystals, the hand cranla,

generator repair kit, etc. This is to be picked up later.

He also agreed to send the SAO some money and said he would

get support for the organization from certain other people

and would put the So in contact with the underground Cuban

Refugee Organization, Alpha 66.

Apparently CONDE is running for election to the

County Board of Supervisors for the seat now held by WALTER

SCHEIDLE. He claims he has the backing of both the La Jolla

and Clairemont Town Councils. He is also supposed to be

chairman of a couple of local parent associations and is

highly regarded in the Republican Party for his previous

campaign efforts in behalf of Governor REAGAN.

CONDE claimed to. DAVIS and GODFREY that a former

Special Agent of the FBI at San Diego named "BOB SUNDQUIRT",

NN 55009 DooId: 32989524 Page 662

---

## Page 663

or something similar, had owed him a considerable amount of

money and that CONDE: had been squeezing this individual for

Information even before he retired from the FBI. He said

the former Agent attempted to pay him off with bad checks

which came back marked "insufficient funds". CONDE said

he still has these .checks and showed DAVIS and GODFREY one

for $200.00. He claimed that the former agent is now working

for him as a carpenter doing boat repair work which CONDE

has contracted.

CONDE also talked about the publicity he received

in recent months when he offered to outfit and arm a patrol

boat to accompany the American tuna fishing fleet to South

American waters to keep them from being seized by latin

American Navies. In this regard, he said that many people

came to see him from all over the country volunteering to

go and work as crew members on such an expedition.

CONDE indicated that he possessed either an

M-1 carbine which can be converted to fire fully automatic;

or an M2 carbine, which lacks certain parts in order to

fire fully automatic, and asked DAVIS and GODFREY if they

would help him put it together. DAVIS said he would do

5O.

## Page 664

DAVIS also offered to use the organization and

facilities of the SAO to assist CONDE in his campaign.

This help would include quietly planting literature for

CONDE on the SAO printing presses and also to assist him

in exposing problems which his urponents may have.

I was in contact yesterday with RON ZARICK. As

usual, he was talking about firearms and other things. He

claimed he had recently acquired an M-28 Thompson Submachine

gun and an M-3 grease gun which he offered to sell to me.

He said he wanted to know whether I warted them by tonight

at the latest.

He is asking $200 for the M-28, and $125 for

the M-3. This is more money than I can come up with.

He also claimed he had possession of some hand

grenade fuses, some practice grenades, and some smoke grenades.

He claimed these things came from a private collection of

an individual living somewhere north of San Francisco who

was going to bring them down if ZARICK could sell enough of

them.

I also received a letter today from GENE BOSARTH,

P.O. Box 15662, San Diego, California, and home address 6979

Galewood, San Diego, who has offered to furnish information

- 3 -

NW 55009. -DocId: 32989524• Page :664

## Page 665

to the SAO. He is a student at San Diegn State College and

either has ties with or access to information about New

Left activities on that campus. In his letter, he indicated

he had come across some information which he thought might

be of inierest to the SAO.

In addition, I was talking to STAN MC DADE this

morning. He told me he and HOWARD CLELAND were driving

out near the Singing Hills Golf Course yesterday when they

noticed they were being followed by someone in what they

described as a yellow 1970 Mustang with California license

823 EIY. MC DADE said he and CLELAND took a round-a-bout

route to the San Diego Fish and Game Association Range

and: the yellow car stayed with them all the way. MC DADE

said when they got out at the range, he and CLELAND acted

like they didn't know the other car had been following them.

He said the occupants of the other car also pretended the

same thing and came up to MC DADE and CLELAND offering to

sell them some riot guns. MC DADE said he and CLELAND

were suspicious of a set-up and backed out of the

situation saying they would have to think about it.

I have also talked today with SAM DAVIS. He said

he believed he had observed a car conducting a moving

-surveillance of his house. He said the license number on

the car was YCD 112.

He claimed he did not think the car

"...

*;,

was a police department undercover car and thought perhaps

some Left Wingers had come up with his address.

SAM said

this morning he received a Xerox copy of an SAO application

form in the mail from one TOM Pi INE (phonetic) enclosing

$5.00. The return address was a Post Office box in Tucson,

Arizona. If I can, I will get the address later.

EV MOORE also wrote DAVIS and asked if there was

any way he and BARRY GODFREY coula make it to the Tucson gun

show this weekend, as there are some people at Tucson he wants

them to meet. He said he also had some good recruitment.

prospects for the StO. MOORE is supposed to be a master •

locksmith and has offered to write a training bulletin for

the SAO on lock picking. DAVIS said he would contact HOWARD

CLARK who now has a private pilot's license and see if he

can rent a plane with CLARK and fly over to Tucson to meet

MOORE.

SAM said the SAO had also received a letter from

a woman at Vista, California. He said he would give me

her name and address later. In the letter, she described

herself as a widow with two children and stated she wanted to

do something for her country and had been thinking about

joining a police or sheriff's reserve unit. However, she

said she had heard about the SAo and thought that if it was

5-

truly patriotic, she would rather join it.

SAM said the SAO had received another letter which

came from "Newsweek" magazine at Los Angeles asking if the

SAO would grant an interview to the magazine. In its letter,

"Newsweek" said it was preparing an article dealing with

Leftist groups in the San Diego area in connection with the

1972 Republican National Convention.

"Newsweek" said it had

run across the SAO and would like to do a colum on it too.

DAVIS said he thought he would like to give such an interview

if the meeting could be made secure and if the SAO's Post

Office Box number would appear in the article.

SAM said the SAO had also received a nice letter

from the "San Diego Evening Tribune" which also wants an

interview. He said in its letter, the "Tribune" said the

organization appeared secretive and wondered if the SAO

would allow the "Tribune" to do an article presenting the

organization's views. I understand that this was mentioned

to LOU CONDE when DAVIS and GODFREY went to see him and he

was very happy about it. He said he knows several people

very well at the "Tribune" and would talk to them and get

an

assurance of favorable treatment of the SAO by the paper.

However, DAVIS thinks such an interview might be a little premature

6

as he feels that certain comments made in the interview might

be too much of a slap at the San Diego Police Department.

By the way, when I was talking to STAN, he said

he would like to bury some more Mauser rifles because they

are cheap. He claims to have already buried some of these

rifLeS.

He said the Customs Agent who had wanted to buy

•a machine gun from him had been back to see him again.

MC DADE said he thought the Customs Agent wanted to join

the SAO. GODFREY's opinion is that the guy is a real

"9ook".

MC DADE said that he had been in contact with

GEORGE HCOVER. He said HOOVER has been running around

with RICHARD and GENEVIEVE FLEURY who live in Harbison

Canyon across

from the Gunsmoke Ranch. He said that JERRY

LEE BUSCH hes been living at the FLEURY place off and on

and has set up rifle and pistol ranges there where they

' have been doing some target practice. HOOVER has apparently

been out attempting to recruit some members for the SAO and

has come up with a couple of prospects from the beach area

who are long hairs. He believes these people are Right

Wing-oriented but GODFREY says most likely they are attempting

to infiltrate the SiO for the Left.

On Saturday, the 15th of January, SCOTT WINCHESTER

came down to San Diego from Los Angeles. SAM and STAN met

him somewhere and then went to STAN's house to talk. GODFREY

met the there later. The discussion lasted for several hours.

WINCHESTER advised he was in the process of setting up a

. headquarters for his organization at Los Angeles. He claimed

that he wanted to work with the SAO and said he would offer

the SAO the use of his facilities in Los Angeles. Later,

DAVIS and GODFREY said they were cool to the idea of forming

an alliance with WINCHESTER as they think he is an idiot and

is lousy on his security precautions. They said they will

gradually break off contact with him.

During the meeting with WINCHESTER, the participants

took a break once because WINCHESTER said he wanteã to go

and talk with some members of the local NSWPP Unit. Because

DAVIS and NC DADE are well-known to the local NSWPP, WINCHESTER

and GODFREY went, each using assumed names. They talked with

GERALD LFE SMITH, leader of the local NSWPP Unit. During

the conversation with SMITH, WINCHESTER brought his own name

up and SMITH, not knowing whom he was talking to, made many

uncomplimentary remarks about WINCHESTER.

After returning to MC DADE'S house, WINCHESTER

talked a lot about anti-Semitism and how he believed himself

JANUARY 31, 1972

BY JEROME

I was talking yesterday with GEORGE HOOVER.

He has been spending a great deal of time at the residence

of RICHARD and GENEVIEVE FLEURY in Harbison Canyon across

the road from the Gunsmoke Ranch.

JERRY LEE BUSCH has also been spending a lot

of time there and lives with the FLEURYs part time.

Another individual who also has been spending

a considerable amount of time with the FLEURYs is a person

whose name is DICK DEXTER OF DEXTRAND. DEXTER is a member of

the Swallows Nudist Camp which is also located across Harbison

Canyon Road from the FLEURYS. DEXTER has apparently been trying

to work a way into some of the Right Wing activities which other

people at the FLEURYs are involved in and is suspected of

being an infiltrator, mostly because of the fact he lives

in Ocean Beach.

FEBRUARY 2,

BY JEROME

Yesterday, I accompanied STAN MC DADE to keep

• an appointment with GENE BOSARTH, the San Diego State

College student who has indicated a willingness to

furnish

information about New Left oriented activities at San Diego

State College to the SAO. BOSARTH claimed to have written

letters to Governor REAGAN regarding the PETER BOHER situation

• at State College requesting that some action be taken against

BOHMER. MC DADE backed off a little when BOSARTH mentioned

he had been contacted by the local office of the California

Bureeu of Criminal Investigation and Identification and even

went so far as to suggest that we might do the same thing.

Later in the day, I learned from both MC DADE and

SAM DAVIS that there was a type of vigilante meeting in Lakeside

several days ago of local individuals and groups. It appears

this meeting was held to discuss and plan out actions to be

taken to keep hippies and other undesirable individuals out

of the Lakeside area during the Republican National Convention

in San Diego this summer.

It was brought to my attention that the semi-annual

Yuma Gun Show will be held on the 25th, 26th, and 27th of

February. I was told that CY ANDERSON will be coming down

from Seattle to attend this gun show and will come to San

Diego several days in advance to take care of some business here.

PAUL RUPLINGER told me yesterday he was at an

NSWPP meeting last Wednesday night at the San Diego unit

headquarters. He said about 20 people were in attendance

and had come to hear a speaker from Los Angeles, known as

"Captain K" tell about recent confrontations by the NSWPP

and the Jewish Defense League at Los Angeles. He said

VIC WALTON was one of those people he recognized as being

in attendance at this meeting.

I was also told yesterday by GEORGE HOOVER that •

an NSWPP member named WAKEFIELD had been booted out of the

organization for engaging in unauthorized ativities such as

throwing bricks through the windows of various New Left

establishments.

REPORT OF JEROME

February 6, 1970

:

I talked to,BILL CLAY last night. He has

•been out of touch since last Friday night, and could

not be reached by telephone and was never at home

when I went by.

Apparently some member of the Minutemen

Organization

or another right winger is being watched

or surveilled and CLAY is quite excited about it.

He

thinks the FBI is doing the watching and he wants to place

a surveillance on the Sàn Diego FBI Office for the pur-

pose of determining the times of arrival and departure

of the employees and

obtaining the descriptions and

License plate number of FBI autorobiles.

He is going

to try to get

several people together who will be able

to spend time watching the FBI Office.

BY JEROME

I attended the Cuc planning meeting in Balboa

Park last night.

Igot there at about 7:10

• but the meeting did not get going til 7:35.

There were approximately 50 to 60 people present.

•The meeting was chaired by the Reverend BILL COATS.

•I saw FREITJOF THYGISON "there, however, he left early,

in disgust.

1 aLso recognized ALAN STANCLIFF, SYLVLA

SHAPIRO and BERNIE SENTER in the crowd.

Also present

was a young white individual in his early 20s with long

dark brown hair. He was wearing a fatigue jacket with

red stars

on the collar.. I heard him refer to as "ILOYn"(howe/l

and he said he was a representative of the San Diego

Street Jounal.

Baraman

Two other persons who spoke at the meeting

claimed to be representatives of MDM. One was a clean

white male with a military look, medium build, about

5'9" tall.

He has light colored hair and wearing

• a Mao-

tse-tung

style quilted cap. The other vias also about

5'9" tall, medium build, long blond hair who wore gola

rimmed glasses; a red jacket and camouflage pants.

It was decided there would be city wide peace

activity. during the week of April 13 to 18, 1970. However,

there was a lot of arguments and backbiting as to whether

actual peace march should take place on April 15 or

April 18, 1970.

It was agreed the march should probably

start aù noon and that it would be a flop if less than

8,000 people showed up.

The MDM representative with the Mao tse-tung

cap was screaming that people from the military and people

with jobs could not come of the rally was held on the 15th,

a Wednesday, and finally the MDM and Street Journal prople

walked out of the meeting.

After they left, there was

some discussion about a possible compromise where the rally

would be held on wednesday evening and servicemen wouls

be bussed

to it.

Before they left, the people from the Street

Journal announced that they had moved into new offices

but were evicted the same day after the police department

talked to their new lardlord. They said that they had an

offset place which they would use to make posters

for.

During the meeting, it was announced that there

would be efforts made to organize a city wide student

strike at high schools on April 15, 1970.

It was also announced that MDM would have a

mock trial of the military on April 1, 1970, which will be

composed of active duty GIs and

with MARK LANE as prosecutor.

It was eventually decided that the April demon-

stration would again consist of a march from downtown San

Diego to a rally in Balboa Park.

People were asked to volunteer to work on the

various planning committee.

One interesting think that occurred was a

speech by a man from the audience who claimed that

the November 15, 1969, demonstration in San Diego

was nothing more than a disorganized mob. He said

the planning for the peace demonstration was all wrong

and that the

demonstration should be held on a weekend

• SO

workers could join in. He said the people at the meeting

should due as had been done where, he said, groups of

30,000 to 40,000 workers had been organized to march down

the streets chanting.

This individual seemed to be well known, was a

white male, about 60 years old, gray hair, 5'7"

•and

stocky built. He had a flat, round face and spoke with

a heavy European accent.

There were no colored people at the meeting.

A demonstration began today at San Diego State

College and students from the school took over part of

'the administration building and at one time there were

close to 700 students there with more expected to arrive

after 4:00 p.m, when classes were out. It has the earmarks

of lasting for

a long time.

The demonstration was touched off at about noon

by a speech given by KARL KELIER at a rally on the library

loan.

The students are protesting administrative action

taken by the school against four professors there.

Food including apples, oranges, carrots, punch

and loaves of bread is being passed around in the building

and is apparently being prepared at the Wesleyan Foundation

Building.

Signs have been put up in the building indicating

that the restrooms have been "liberated" and are now co-educational.

Some marijuana was seen being passed out free. About 100

students have elected to stay over night and are going home

in shifts to obtain sleeping bags and other items.

The demonstration appeared to be well planned and

some organizers, including RHETTA ALEXANDER for one, were

seen communicating with walkie-talkies. Other persons

observea taking part in the demonstration wee RON BREEN,

STEVE NYSTROM,

BERNIE SENTER, ALAN STANCLIFF, SUKUMO and

I stopped by State College about 11:00 p.m. last

night. There were about 75 students in the halls

of the

administration building who were painting 30' long banners

and placing them on the walls of the administration building.

They were also printing leaflets announcing a rally at noon

today o campus.

LEON NOWER was observed there holding hands

with a young girl. BERNARD STREIFF, the french student

who claims to have participated in the french student

revolt, was also there.

APRIL 15, 1970

BY JEROME

I met an interesting individual at BILl CLAY'S

house last night.

He is, called "The Judge" and his

first name is JERRY.

He i's about 5'10"

, to 5'11" tall,

230 pounds, has heavy built, ruddy complexion and is

35-45 years old.

He has black hair which is receding,

a pug nose, round face and heavy jowels. He carries

a brown and .32 automatic pistol and is apparently

an excellent shot.

He said he spent 8 years in military intelligence

following which he worked for the CIA and then for the FBI

assassin for the CIA.

and I was told he was good at make-up and voice imitations.

He said he had worked at Hollywood as a bit player.

He claimed that when he worked for the FBI

at San Diego, he was assigned to watch TROY HOUGHTON

and that he quit at about the time of the watts riot

in LosAngeles.

He said he was never a close acquaintance

of HOUGHTON but he had followed HOUGHTOr a lot and

came to the personal conclusion HOUGHTON was a Communist.

He seems almost to have convicted CLAY of this also.

As CLAY staled, he had verified that HOUGHTON

had been meeting some known members of the Communist

Party. BUSH and CLAY were thinking DE PUGH may have

become aware of this and had HOUGHTON eliminated.

If

this is so, cuat said he vias thinking about contacting

DE PUGH and humbly apologize for po trying to break away

from the national Mi organization.

"The Judge" is supposed to be from Virginia, although

he has no accent, and apparently hates colored people. He

speaks fluent German and Spanish.

CLAY stated he believes one of the leading Leftists

in the area is MORRIS KOMINSKY who lives at. 400 Last Franklin

Street, Elsinore, ralifornia.

He has written a book which

is being advertised in papers like the Iree Door and the

Street Journal. KOMINSKY allegedly moved in high circles

in the Federal

and local Governments at one time and has

supposedly been visited on numerous occasions, high placed

Government people, including Congressien, Senators, and Presi-

dents such as TRUMAN, EISENHOWER, and KENNEDY.

CLAY said he wants some

local Right Wing neonle

to visit KOMINSiN and somehow get his signature.

MAY 1, 1970

BY JEROME

Today, I went with "The Judge" to see MORRIS

KOMINSKY.

KOMINSKY is an order man, 60-70 years of age,

about 5'9" tall, curly black hair which has a lot of gray

in it, blue eyes. He weights 160-170 pounds, has poor

posture, as he slouches and has a pot belly.

From his

statements, I gathered that he is very much in favor of

what the San Diego Street Journal is doing. He said he

gave all his records to the street Journal

and claimed

that it took 5 Street Journal staff members 8 hours to

copy his notes oi the San Diego area alone. He claimed

he had much more information on Right Wing activities

in America and claimed he has

spent five years researching

information for his new book which will be called "Count

DOwn, USA. "

He said the first volume of this book which

be an expose on fascism in the United States, will

be 800 pages long and the second volume will be 1300 pages

Today, I went to a meeting at the Greek

Bowl at State Collese to find out about the march route

for the anti-var demonstration to ba held tomorrow.

There were about 60 people in attendance at the meeting

which started about 3:00 PiN.

these included Bat coAls,

ALAN STANCHIFT, FREITJOF, THYGESON, GARY GULLEY, JACKQUELYNE

LUMbURG, and a reverend from the Wesleyan Foundation.

There was a big hassle about the choice of the

march route; the ChiC wanted to march from Horton Plaza in

downtown San Diego, along Broadway to the 1lth Naval District

Headquarters for some speeches and then to the old ferry

landing for a rally.

SMS and the other students voted this down and

CMC almost walked out. A long debate followed resulting

considerable uneasiness between CMC and SMC. ALAN STANCLIFF

was selected as monitor captain.

Afterwards, I went with BILL CLAY to Grossmont

College where another anti-war rally was taking place and

picked up some leaflets, which are attached.

We noted that they were passing out free food.

BIlL ChAY went and got some syringes and FRANK YACOPEC

bought some pickles which were injected with rubbing

a Icohol and castor oil and were passed out to the students

who were seen eating them. It is not noted if any of

them became 111.

FRANK YACOPEC set fire to a trash can in a rest-

room to cause a little extra excitement.

drove by the People's Commune and saw three male individuals

wearing Army helmets.

demonstration in San Diego.

They marched from the downtown

area to Balboa Park where a rally was held.

It was noted

that MDM marched as a separate unit in the

and was trying to cause trouble.

BILL CLAY, who was present recognized two "long

I was told that the demonstration march was stopped

at the 5th Avenue Bridge over Interstate Highway 5 and that

BILL CLAY and his friends were the ones who stopped it.

BILL CLAY got into a discussion with FREITJOF

THYGESON, who appeared

to be very disgusted with the repetitive

nature of the demonstration and the location of the march.

Persons observed present at the demonstration

included HERBERT MARCUSE, BILL MILSON, WARREN NIELSEN,

PETER CARTWRIGHT, BILL COATS and ALAN STANCLIFF.

SYLVIA SHAPIRO was the Master of Ceremonies and

STUART INNERST was the main speaker. JAN DIEPERSLOOT and

RON BREEN also spoke. Dr. GEORGE ABBOTT was also there and

had organized an emergency medical corps using walkie-talkies

and with ambulances available.

Sergeant BILL COOK of the La Mesa Police Department,

and the Captain of the Security Guards at Convair (NFI)

were there and were taking good photographs of the demonstration.

It was learned that BILL CLAY "liberated" two rolls

It was noticed that apples

up some oranges with anti-freeze and donate them to the

upcoming MDM rally at Oceanside.

I was talking to BILL CLAY lust Saturday.

He seemed agitated and

said he had needer to use a

10t

oI caution.

he said nowever, he wanted his name

used and known as the local Minutemen (MM) leader

and that he wanted this done to attract Federal

attention in order to protect

someone else in the

background.

He is still talking about a new Right Wing

organization and claimed to have contacts with groups

in 11 western states and

said these people are trying

to establish a communications network and said the

name American Resistance Movement (ARM) had been

selected for this organization.

CLAY got to talking about DE PUGH and said he

had been aware of DE PUGH's whereabauts when he was in

hiding.

He said he now has reason to believe TROY HOUGHTON

may still be alive and probably connected with ARM. He

said he believes HOUGHTON may have wanted out of the MM

organization, for some reason, and had to disappear to do so.

CLAY also talked about setting up a meeting with .

the leftist student group at University of California at

San Diego during the regular week and he would like himself,

BARRY GODFREY, SAM DAVIS, and GEORGE HCOVER to meet with

four students

from that group.

I have learned that HOOVER always carries a

savage. 380 pistol when he is away from home.

:::.

It has been learned that with the help of BARRY

GODFREY, BILL CLAY moved last Friday, June 5, # supposed

apartment at 1113 Ingraham, San Diego. This

to be Ingraham® Villa.

No one is supposed to know about this

address.

CLAY had a large quantity of personal belongings

and junk to move and has rented a garage near Second and

Ivy (between Ivy and Juniper on the east side of Second

there is a row of four garages and CLAY has the second from

the left, where he is storing some of this stuff.

040 It was also learned that GEORGE HOOVER was at BILL

CALY's now apartment Friday evening and was in a talkative

mood as he was dead drunk. HOOVER apparently works at the

same place as SAM DAVIS. HOOVER said DAVIS was recently

in Texas on vacation and coming back his automobile broke

down at Gila Bend, Arizona, and HOOVERbad to go out there to

assist him.

Their boss at

the fence company, is also supposed

to be a Minutemen and HOOVER and DAVIS are probably getting

some of their explosives from the fence company.

HOOVER now uses a .45 Automatic Pistol which he even

takes to bed with him. He claimed his boss recently put

up $400 to get him out of some legal trouble.

HOOVER Said he had been living with a girl (NFI)

who in the recent past, had walked out on him and had said

she was going to contact the BI. HOOVER seemed to be

worried about this.

HOOVER was getting more drunk all the time and

began rambling about "the ranch" where he lives. He said he

had just moved out of the hotel into one of the smaller

houses on te ranch.

He kept talking about his horse and

asked CLAY to call "WILLIE" at the ranch and' ask him to feed

the horse.

HOOVER uses the nickname "Mick" and usually

hangs out at the "341 Club" on Second Street in El Cajon.

He also kept talking.'about a ROGER who went with him to

talking about may Live of

get SAM DAVIS.

This ROGER may live or work with HOOVER.

During the evening CLAY approached HOOVER about

doing something to PETER CARTWRIGHT for spilling the beans

on the undercover police officer named JOHN MURRAY.

It was also learned that many Minutemen, knowing

that law enforcement officers are prone to handcuff people

behind their backs, are now carrying handcuff keys attached

to the inside rear waist band of their pants where they

I have learned that BILL CLAY has been approached

hy a group of leftist students at University of California

,at san Diego who are allegedly fed up with the left wing

tactics which have been-used at University of california

at San Diego and are supposed to want to form an alliance

with right wing groups and individuals to deal with the

Government. BILL CLAY seems to be enthusastic about such

an alliance as he feels there is a considerable amount of

agreement between right and left wing groups as to the

goals they would Ilke to achieve and their general disillu-

sionment with the Government and the established order.

CLAY Is giving the matter. careful thought and may recon-

tact this group of students at a future time.

JEROME

An acquaintance, ARTHUR HANSEN, told me today

•there is a house at 711 Fern Glen, La Jolla, about two

houses from HANSEN's home which is occupied by "three

weirdo men"

who llve, there together. They have many

stop signs, apparently stolen from intersections around

town which they have nailed to the fence in their back

yard. HANSEN said he recently observed one of these men

In the back yard at 711 Fern Glen wearing a housecoat and

a red wig.

HANSEN also told me that the night before the

"pig invasion" of la Jolla, his sleep was disturbed by

loud noises at approximately 3:00 a.m. and looking out

his bedroom

window he saw many cars arriving in front of

the house at 711 Fern Glen to the point that the street

was filled up with cars. He said each car carried two

to five male individuals and he estimated a total of 50

to 60 people entered the house at 711 Fern Glen. HANSEN

said he watched this incident until approximately 5:00 a.m.

when he went back to bed and as yet none of the individuals

had left the house. He said, however, when he awoke the

next day the cars appeared to be gone. HANSEN thought

this incident might have had some connection with the yippie

invasion of la Jolla the following day.

REPORT BY JEROLZ

on August T, 1970.

Yesterday, August 6, 1970, I went to watch

the National Yipple Day a Disneyland. Many long hairs

and hippie type people were at the gate and parking lot

all day long but there weze never enough there

at one

time to nake

a big crowd and most left after milling

around fos a while. It appeared that they just did not

have enough money to get in..

FRANK YACOPEC, JERRY TARTAGLIO and others got

in using Press Cards from the Anaheim Bulletin. Also unere

was EUGZIE BROWN from the

Orange County True Press, SIEVE

FRANKS frOm VIVA and many other righo wingeis fron the

Orange county area. The group took several hunared photo-

gra' 'is and shot two rolls si movie films.

The only serious incident occurred at about

6:30 p.m., when 300 o 400 yippies got together and started

marching fron place to place in Disneyland. There were

several scuffles with the police who were called in at

about 7:00 pin., and one girl was yelling "Kill the Pig,

Kill the Pig.

The yippies made an attemot to tear down the

flag in the fort Dut JaRRY TARTAGLIO and "CHUCK" stood

against the flag pole and stopped them.

He got into

a scuffle with the police and

a cop grabbed him by the

hair, which caine right off showing hin to be very bald.

It looked to me as if there would have been

serious trouble if the yippies had been able to get a few

more people in there.

However, they backed right down

when they were confronted by the police. A lot of threats

were made and obscenity used.

During the day I noted about six yippies in front

of the gate with 15 - 20 ticket books passing out tickets

to other yippies to get in. Someone put out a lot of

money for a lot of yippies to get in.

Jerome

After the

yippies were thrown out, there

was some cock throwing at the gate and an attempted

, march on the Disneyland Hotel which the police broke

. up..

It was later announced that people with long hair

would no longer be allowed admittance into Disneyland.

worLd IdeNtify ANOtheR INFOrMANT

I was talking

to PETER RUPLINGER yesterday.

JIM WESTWOOD, use to work for the

an informer.

According to PETER,

WESTWOOD lives on Seventh Avenue near Balboa Park.

He said that WESTwOOD told hin that he heard strange

noises in front of his house a couple of nights ago,

and went to the front door to see what was going on.

He said he saw Professor LION NOWER, apparently very

drunk,

fooling

around with WESTWOOD's automobile.

WESTWOOD asked NOWER what he was doing and what he

wanted and NOWER said he was looking for a girl and

asked if she lived in any of the houses nearby.

No

one knew why NOWER was actually there.

There is much antigonism between the right

wing group in san diesa name meles..

The Orange

County True Press has Sostu

of the Los

Angeles groups are trying to dis-credit FRANK YACOPEC,

who was working on the paper and have made JERRY

TARTAGLIO mad at him. It looks like JOHN ZaMANEC of

AVG and LLOYD PULLEN Of STAFF are trying to move in on

Orange County True Press.

Those two aya GLEN

JACKSON of the Nationa]. Patrotic Party and LAURENCE

NORION connected with the Minute-men and AVG were at

a meeting with JERRY TARTAGLIO at two o'clock in the

morning last week and apparently want to stop all righi

wing activity in San Diego.

I was told that EUGENE BROWN, editor of the

Orange County Irue Press and TARTAGLIO have been trying

to get FRANK YACOPIC anu BARRY GODFREY'S address in

San Diego.

VIVA is a front group for ED BUILER who puts

out the Orange County True Press.

Attached arecopies

of the June ana July 19%0 issues

of the paper.

I was talking to BILI CLAY this morning

about the situation and he suggested trying to push the

San Diego Minute-men organization in Orange County. He

was talking about

setting up a mail drop in Yuma os

Phoenix, Arizona.

would Identify Another INfoRMAN

I saw PETER RUPLINGER last Saturday. He

Insisted that his cousin, Jhi HastwOOD, once worked

for the FBI as an informer.

He said WESTWOOD told

him the FBI had asked about him, PETER, but faid

nothing more to him except the FBI was

thinking about

meantacting hin as a source.

PETER said if the FBI did not hurry in

contacting hin, he would contact the FBI as he wants

to become an Agent when he graduates from school.

The Minute-nen at San Diego have put out a

bunch of new stickers (one is attached). The La liesa

Post Office Box nuiber on the sticker is listed to

BILI, CLAY, with whom I talked on Friday. He said

that he does not want to be contacted by right wingers

In the san Diego area, except in an emergency because

he does not want to be connected with the new stickers.

He thinks the BI will be around to see him about the

stickers anyway.

I do not know what CLAY is up to. It may

be he is trjing to separate himself from 10021 right

wing activities or possibly he is trying to decoy

attention away Iron people involved in local Minute-men

activities.

I suill get the feeling CLAY is involved

in something big and is trying to get some osganization

going in several states.

I also stopped off at JERRY GaYaR's house

Friday evening and saw a big tripod mounted World War II

German nachine gun. He also had all oi the grease

gun parts laying around and had a case

oí a

dozen

timing devices for artillery shells.

REPORT BY JERONE

August 27, 1970

This morning I was talking to General WILLIAM

LEMLY who lives at 1536 Glorietta Place, Coronado.

•He clained to have been part of a Military underground

•organization since 1927, which was strong because of

lears in the Military of Communist takeover in this

country.

He told me that AVG actually stands for

American Volunteer Government.

He explained that

later on the organization felt a need for an above-

ground iront organization ana so established the American

VoLunteer Group, With LEDRIC "BUD"

and with an savisory Council oi 13 Military JIIIcers.

•These included Connancer BALDORE who refusea to go to

Vietnam because

General

the Government would not fight to win,

"CHESTY" PULLEN, General CUSTIS La HAL, anc

others.

According to LaMIy, membershio in American

Volunteer Groups was to be opened

to civilians but

restricted only to those referred to the organization

by the Military Council and those who were already

menbers.

When "SUD" JOHNSON died, under mysterious

circunstances, JOHN ZElANIC and his secretary, HELEN

GRANT,

took over.

ZEMAREC and GRANT then threw the

Mility Council anope da tie de cares the Military

is concerned, that part of AvG is now defunct.

LENLY told me that the nane A. DUNN which

appears on old AVG bulletins and letterhead stationery

is a pseudony for a woman izon Seatule. He said she

is an agent for a private investigative group which

has its headquarteis on the east coast.

Jacive group is run by a tormer abI Agent named FRAN

CAPELO phonetic and investigates left wing activities.

CAPELO is suppose to be in the San Diego area

in the near future, and LiLY said he would refer ie

to hin foi possible enployuent as an Agent on the west

coast.

LEMLY claimed that he and ROBERT WELSH,

• leader of the John Sirch Society are good friends

and connunicate frequently.

IBiTY claimed that he

is Vice-President of the National Liberty Amendment

Committee, which ie a front gaouo for the John Birch

society.

The Liberty Anendment

represents the

testifying last

week before a California Stave

Senate

Group about the amendment.

I saw IaHLY on PAUL RUPLINGER's recomendation.

LENLY claimed he and PAUL• RUPLINGER are also good friends.

LEiTy again talked about the American Volunteer Government

and said the purpose of the organization is to bring

about a Military coup in this country if it becomes

necessary.

He said the organization's headquarters

are located in si near Washington, D.C.

LENLY said that JOHN ZEMANEC was formerly

Chief of security of the above ground organization under

JOHSON and his secretary, HELEN GRANT, was suppose to

be a teacher but LiLy's group was never able to verify

this. LanLy said that because of the peculiar circum-

stances surrounding JOHNSON's death, his group did a

little investigating ard found thât ZuMANiC was a

Long Shorman and belonged to HARRY BRIDGES Long Shorman

Union. LENtY said that ZaMANEC night actually have

been a left wing infiltratoi.

LilLy appeared to be very Military, anti-leit

and pro-minute-nen and may forn an alliance with the

Minute-nen in this

area.

LENLY who was in ONI for several years, also

claimed to have access to Canadian and British Intelligence

Reports Icom'all over the

world, through a friend wns is

still in Washingion, D.C.

After talking to ISLY, I saw BILL CLAY Who

told ne that he is now working in some big national

movement and can no longer spare the time to be deeply

involved in local Ninute-hen activities.

REPORT BY JEROIE

August 31, 1970

I found out this morning in talking with

DALE HERSCHLER that the manager of Les Girls who was

• suppliting the Face Door financially backed out two

• WeekS

ago and the paper is now in trouble. For the

first time the Door is planning to charge for the

newspaper.

they still may not have enough noney to

print it.

They have decided to stop carrying sex

oriented

adds in the paper.

I also learned that the Sunrise newspaper

lost at least $8,000 on the rock concert it sponsored

and does not have enough

money to go on printing.

I talked to General LINLY of AVG again who .

told me that "BUD" JOHNSON, former leader of AVG,

was in the process of putting together a big expose

on the Conmunist Party in the United States at the

time of his death. LINLY said JOHNSON was getting

his information from a former Military Intelligence

Officer who was also connected with AvG. LalLY said

he and other officers in the Military part of AVG

Suspect JOHN EMANdC may have had JOHNSON done in and

the Military part of AvG is out to get ZEMIANEC and

the civilian AVG organization if they can.

LEMLY claimed he and some right wing friends

were responsible for putting togetehr and passing out

the leaflets announcing the Yippie Pig National Invasion

of La Jolla early in the summer.

LEnly said although

they did not think anything would actually happen, it

turned out better than expected as many La Jollans

were turned against une leit and have indicated

support for right wing activities.

The new minute-men stickers were printed at

Alex Rapid Print in La Mesa, California.

September 2, 1970

I learned this afternoon from Message Information

Center that an unidentified group of individuals in the

'San Diego area is preparing for a large scale anti-Vietnam

war demonstration tomorrow during the festivities sur-

rounding the visit and State dinner of

Presidents NIXON

and apart

from the previously announced "Yippie Dope-In"

at Coronado, California, tomorrow.

According to MIC plans for the demonstration call

for participants to gather in the Hotel Del Coronado

parking lot for a rally and march beginning at 9:00 A.M.

I have also learned that a large number of

REPORT BY JEROME

September 18, 1270

This morning I went to Message Information Center,

arriving there at about 10:30 AM. Already there were TOM

HYDE and a young high school kid named STEVE (LNU) who was

learning how to be a MIC operator.

I shot the breeze with HYDE for about an hour.

He told me he is now Acting Co-ordinator for MIC. He said

, there will be a change in MIC leadership as he, HYDE, will

be leaving in about a month. He did not say where he is

going.

supposed to be going to work full time with the San Diego

Street

Journal. According to HYDE, both the Street Journal

and Sunrise are supposed to be out again in a

few weeks.

HYDe said there will be mostly new people on the Street Journal

staff.

HYDE also talked about MIC's "Fugitive File"

• This

file contains information on how to help deserters and draft

dodgers get out of San Diego. He said the file had been taken

out of MIC and hidden because many of the people connected

with this work had been questioned about it recently by the law.

Vitrisis this

He said that when things cooled down, the file

will be improved and put back into MIC. He said one of

the things they planned to do is to ask anyone who calls

for help if he is a Federal Agent, thus hoping to trap him.

He also said that apparently some of the servicemen who

were helped in the past spilled the whole story about MIC

and other people when they got back to their Base.

I stayed at MIC until about one o'clock. After

awhile HYDE left, and I spent the rest of the time showing

SIEVE how to do the work. I received and gave out a lot

of weird messages. I was able to obtain the following

interesting information:

HYDE'S telephone number is 582-8203. PLYMATE'S

telephone number is 232-8657. New Adult Communities new

telephone number is 239-2119, and RICK PHELPS' new address

and emergency only telephone number are 2810 31st Street,

telephone number 283-1934.

I agreed to pull another shift at MIC this Thursday

from 1:00 to 5:00 PM.

When I talked to BILI CLAY yesterday I told

him what I was doing

at lessage Information Center and

he suggested putting some kind of listening device on

the telephone

there.

He said he would start experimenting

around at work today to see what he could come up with.

can only peen seen under certain lighting conditions.

He said this wire is being used in some experiment:

REPORT BY JEROME

September 24g 1970

Yesterday PETER RUPLINGER told me that the

Minutemen now have obtained the following Post Office

Boxes :

1) Post Office Box 3064

La Mesa, California

In the name

Of HOWARD GODFREY Or MIKE MC GAN

2) Post Office Box 76

Spring Valley, California

In the name of GERALD MORAN

3) Post Office Box 2351

La Mesa, California

In the name of CHARLES THROP

Some right wing people are excited about the

SIP rally on October 3, 1970, and may attempt to create

a Iittle excitement.

one of the suggestions made was to

place black powder or primacord in the cracks along the

railroad. tracks over which the marchers will pass and

ignite it as they go by.

I learned that approximately one month ago FRANK

YACOPEC shot a large size steal nut through a window of the

Commune at 2nd and Thorn striking a hippie inside squarely.

on the side of the head.

The hippie dropped as ii shot

but nothing has been heard about it since.

GEORGE HOOVER has been very quiet lately and no

nes Including BIll CLAY seems to know where he is or

what he is doing.

I learned this afternoon that STP is going

to hold a meeting at the 2nd and Thorn Commune at 3:00 P.M.,

today which I will attend If I can.

SEPTEMBER 25,

Yesterday, I spent four hours at Message Information

Center, working the

switchboard from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

I spent most of my time there copying about 300 names and

addresses from the MIC files which I will furnished in the

near future.

Last night, there was an sit organizing meeting

at the Street Joumal building at Second and Thorn.

Apparently,

that was the only SiP meeting which will be held before the

STe demonstration on 10/3/70.

Exploring Family school has apparently moved to

El Cajon and has a new telephone number which I will also

furnish soon.

I discretely observed the STP demonstration

last saturday.

The march and rally looked like a failure

to me because

they only had 200 people participating when

they had announced that they expected 4,000 or 5,000 to

join in.

I was really surprised at the hostility of the

bystanders and onlookers toward the marchers.

Many of

them were yelling

at the marchers.

District Headguarters building or at the Police Department

headquarters

but just walked by chanting and shouting

There were three speakers for the rally at Newtown

Park. The first was RON NIBBE, who apparently had just

been arrested by the police and talked about his arrest

and how it was unjustified. He said everyone should be

good Communist comrades and buy guns. He said that the

people should oppose and dereat the police and completely

eliminate them.

He said it was unwise to seek community

control of the police asd by having them live in the communities

becase then they would know what was going on all the time.

The next speaker was a young male Negro individual

who said he was a representative of the Committee to Free the

He said the Soledad brothers trial

is going to be moved to San Diego and that as mụch of the

committee as possible would also be moved to San Diego. He

said however, that many people who belonged to and worked with

the committee up north won't be able to come to San Diego

and that the committee needs volunteers from the San Diego

area to carry on its work. I didn't know what this person's

name was.

The last speaker was CARLOS CALDERON who said he

wanted to organize the Chicano movement and truth about

the great heritage of the Latinos and gave several examples

such as CHE GUEVARRA with whom he apparently was very impressed.

It was

announced that Experimental College

at san Diego State College is going to have a workshop

course on Communism this fall.

there was a guy going around

Communist newspaper.

I believe I heard someone call

him by the name of MIKE.

He was about 6'1" tall, 220

pounds, brown hair, receding at the forehead, 28 years

old.

He was accompanied by a girl name KATHY, who is

apparently connected with women's Liberation and PLP.

KATHY was about 5'5"

, in her

early 20's, curly brown

hairs very slim build.

These people said that there is

a new discussion meeting each Sunday on

"Challenge"

and PLP and wrote down the address and phone number down

for me, 3993 Broadway, San Diego, telephone 263-1465.

FRANK YACOPEC was also at the rally wearing an

old felt had shot full of holes, a phoney FU MANCHU mustache

and a fatigue jacket. No one paid any attention to him.

Leaving the rally, I almost got into a fight with

three people who were very uptight and thought I must have

been a Lefty.

JIM STEWART,

the fellow who has in his possession

SYLVIA SHAPIRO'S CMC mailing list, is about 19 years old, clean

cut, short hair, seems to be very intelligent and I believe

he is a student.

He lives near the beach and it looks like he

is a person who is mainly responsible for organizing the anti

war demonstration in San Diego on 10/31/70.

I heard some very interesting information about a

store at Julian named the Mountain Market Grocery. Apparently the

people at the store are openly advising for the Minutemen

organization and are selling minutemen and other right-wing

literature over the counter at the store. Idas also told

that collections for DE PUGH's legal defense are also being

taken at the store. I will probably got up there soon and see

what's going on.

I learned from BARRY GODFREY that GLENN MOORE picked up a

hippie female hitchhiker earlier in the week.

She was

apparently very radical, but mooRE got Iriendly with her and she

told him that the recent fires in the mountains were mostly

set by leftists and were part of a leftist plot:

I also learned that there is

going to be a showing

of. a film and a

fund raising event at the Kent Theater on

10/15/70 to raise money and to make plans for the anti-war

demonstration on 10/31/70.

While I was at MIC today I learned about an individual

who is believed to be an undercover police officer by the

Leftists.

This individual is 40 to 50 years old, has dark

greying hair, is unshaven and goes by the name BODINE Or BOLIVAR

or some such similar name.

Apparently he showed up several

weeks ago looking for a ride to the east coast. He claimed

So to ta can se

and also at Santa Barbara.

with him and "crashes" wherever he can.

been checking on him and contacted the free schools at Santa

Barbara and in Colorado and found out that he wasn't known

there.

This plus the fact that he is still around after having

looked for a ride to the east coast makes him believe he is

with the police.

I also saw and met PHIL PLYMALE.

He is extremely

weird looking and has a very strange beard and hair-do even

for the people at Message Information Center.

He impresses

me as being very paranoid and is highly suspicious of everyone.

Last Friday, I went up to Jullan to the Mountain

Market Grocery Store

and met the owner, whose name is MARGIE

MC NICKLES.

MC NICKLES sells Minutemen, Ku Klux Klan and

other similar literature and material across the counter at

her store.

She is also working with the Patriotic Party in San

Diego and told me that she is going to try to form a chapter

0s the Patriotic Action Legion in San Diego.

Her son is supposed to be President of the Young

Republicans Organization at Grossmont College.

She told me that ROBERT DE PUGH has been on trial

Tor all the federal charges against him at Albuquer She said

Mexico, and

has been held in the City Jail there.

DE PUGH was to have been sentenced on 10/9/70 and said that

he was asking for a total of ten years each on nine separate

counts.

MC NICKLES said that the jailors at the Albuquerque

City Jail are taking very good care of DE PUGH as most of

then are very sympathetic to him: MO NICKLES also made a

statement to the effect that if DE PUGH is sent to Leavenworth

he will never get there which I took to mean that there may.

be an escape attempt.

MC NICKLES also said that she knows JOHN ZEMANEC of

AVG and GLENN JACKSON of the Patriotic Party at LOS Angeles.

She showed me an open letter which DE PUGH wrote to ZEMANEC

telling him to get completely out of right-wing activities.

She also had some other stuff which she claimed to have just

recently received from de PUGH.

MC NICKLES also told me there is a commune at Julian

not far from her place.

she said these people are long hairs,

but clean and drive nice cars. She said they moved in several

months ago paying $32,000 cash money for the house. She said

• NW 55009 DocIa: 32989524

Page 907

---

## Page 908

that although the former owner of the house told her he

sold the house to a woman she has seen only male individuals

at the house. She said there are only a few individuals who

stay at the house during the week, but that several carloads

of male individuals arrive each Friday evening and stay over

until Monday morning.

She said she and her husband feel

that some kind of training is going on at the commune as

they have been able to hear radio Morse Code signals from the

house in the evenings when the wind is right.

She said the person who is always at the house, which

is located on Whispering Pines Drive, drives a Car with

California License TXL 136 which also has a Yale sticker

on it. She said cars with the following license plates have

shown up there on the weekends:

VGI. 342

OKU 316

RGD 465

WTH 134

I have learned. that SUNRISE now has a bookstore

at 4855 El Cajon Boulevard. FRANK YACOPEC has been talking

about breaking the windows of the store.

JIM STEWART, address 5854 Ithaca Place, telephone

453-4867, has apparently been connected with a group called

the Non-violent Action Center.

'"The San Diego Street Journal" has a brand new

telephone number which is 235-4478.

BILL CLAY went out of town Friday night and did not

get back until late Sunday night.

He now has his pilot's

license and is certified to fly solo and wherever he went he

flew.

CLAY told me that the Minutemen lost some stuff

during the recent fires in the back country.

He said included

in the losses were a Lewis Machine Gun and several other

small machine guns and some ammunition and explosives which

NW 55009., DocId: DocId:32989524 Page

908

---

## Page 909

weren't buried deep enough. He said the losses weren't serious

and that most of the stuff weren't hurt.

He was talking about

running a survey to locate all the buildings and warehouses

and other places in the county where ammunition and explosives

are stored so that these places could be cleaned out or

blown up in the event it looked like the left was serious

about starting the revolution.

He was also talking about unburying 500 pounds of

explosives to have ready to use in the event of an emergency.

He also said the Minutemen in the area have acquired a new

20mm Caliber Lahti anti-tank rifle.

It has been learned that BERRY GODFREY was

in contact with SAM DAVIS last Saturday. Apparently

he and GEORGE HOOVER and several other people are

planning to change their names, occupations and so

They will try to locate these communes

and conduct terrorist activities against them.

It was also learned that DAVIS attended a .

recent gun show at El Paso, Texas. He reportedly saia

he would put GoDFrEy in touch with his suppliers, who

can get anything in the way of weapons, ammunition

and explosives and other articles when

he leaves.

Apparently DAVIS and HOOVER will put this

plan into effect during the first part of 1971..

• It is known that HARRY RUJA; Professor at

San Diego State College,

has been more active lately.

He has been involved in trying to organize some sit

Ins and some protests against the arrest of LEoN nowar.

He looks as though he may be trying to take NOWER's place

as the radical faculty leader at San Diego State College.

It was also learned that a Datsun pickup truck

which RUJA drives to work was burned up on his driveway

last Saturday night. It is suspected that some of the

local Minutemen may have been responsible.

It was also learned that over the last weekend

the windows at the Sunrise Book sore were broken.

Three .45 caliber grease guns;

One Thompson Sub-Machine Gun;

One Swedish K ( 9mm grefse gun style weapon) ;

A Colt Commando Carbine (A new experimental

automatic weapon in .223 caliber which Colt

hopes will replace the M-16.)

These weapons were all supposedly in good condition

and were fully operational.!

They apparently belonged to a

friend of GEYERS.

It may be that the weapons are going to

a gun show to be held at Yuma, Arizona next weekend.

However

GIVER is offerring. any and all the weapons for sale now.

Attached Is an SMC leaflet which I recently

picked up at SDSC.

It appears that GEORGE HOOVER and SAM. DAVIS

are bosom buddies.

They invited me to go to the cunsmoke

ranch in Harbison Canyon last sunday.

They were both

there and I also met ROGER WILLIS.

In addition there

were three women and two other males at the ranch whose

' names I did not learn.

DAVIS was in Mississippi recently and at the

ranch he was driving

a green Chevrolet van with Mississippi

license F/6192030.

He apparently broke down somewheres

In Texas one the way back and HOOVER went to rescue him.

On the kanch there is a pistol range

and

range with phais

sis up and running targets but that

part was burned down in a recent fire:

The range is

being rebuilt.

There are also two muzzle loading cannons

on the ranch and there is a bunker or open mine shaft

type of thing in the side of ahill. I could see shoring

and supports inside but was not allowed to get close enough

to see what. It was.

shooting and hip shooting and are supposedly good

shots with a :45 caliber automatic pistol. They are

always armed at least with .22 caliber derringer pistol.

SAM DAVIS has many M-2 carbine parts which he

will sell at a good price.

He gets alot of his stuff

from a place in Los Angeles, and he has approached BERRY GODFREY

asking him to stop at that place the next time he is in

Ios Angeles and obtain some hand

grenade casings. The casings

are apparently being sold for $1.00 a piece.

I learned that the house HOOVER lived in on the

ranch was

burned in the fire.

I also learned that

thare are two fellows named STAN (INU) and DAVE (INU)

who live on the ranch.

While I was there SAM was thiring about staging a

punitive raid on the SDPD in retaliation for the arrest of

ISSAC CANTRELL. He said however he did not know CANTRELL.

Jerome

NW 55009 DocId: 32989524 Page-917

## Page 918

DAVIS said he feels that the FBI and SDPD

are communist controled and he wants to neutralize

them.

In particular DAVIS has a special hate for

Agent O'BRIEN of the FBI. He said he knows that most

of the Agents are decent people who are just doing

their job.

However he feels that O BRIEN Is

persecuting the Minutemen as a vengeance and said he

wold give anything to get O'BRIEN's home address

and telephone number.

DAVIS said he was going to price some tear

gas grenades and said he could get primacord in 500 feet

lengths for $30.00.

It was learned that the SMC anti-war march

11/1/70 was a complete failure.

There were only 150 - 200

people who participated in the march, with a few more

attending the rally. Nothing of interest happened

d the speeches given were dull and uninteresting.

I was in contact with PETER REPLINGER

yesterday.

He said there has been evidence of many

students in the school turning against the new left

movement He said apparently the Street Journal and Its

staff had been caught. in some bad lies which had caused

many students to be disillusioned.

It was also learned that SAM DAVIS wants to order

10000 .223 caliber bullets through BARRY GODFREY's contact

which will cost $255.

It was also learned that FRANK

YACOPEC wants to order 1000 M-1 carbine bullets.

IS THE WAR GOING

1oEnD.P

NIXON SAYS WE ARE WITHDRAWING

BUT:

FACT: Last week the Super Carrier Ranger left for Vietnam with over

5,000 men and 125 planes.

FACT:

Friday morning the Carrier U.S.S.

Kitty Hawk leaves San Diego

also for Vietnam with another 5,000 men and 125 planes.

THIS IS ESCALATION

NOT WOTHDRAWAL

This war is costing you, the taxpaying citizen, $2 million each

and every day, that is approximately $1500 a year for every man, woman

and child in this country.

Because a war economy is non-prodactive inflation has run wild,

10% per year nationwide. Because of this war the average citizen

made less real money this year than last despite pay increases. Our

paychecks buy less and less each week.

This is a rich man's war.

How many of the "Big Brass" get shot

up? How many millionaires lose a son or father to keep this war going?

FOR WHAT?

Many of the sailors on this ship realize this and do not wish

to go. They will be gone today but the fight to end the war goes

Disgust with the war is rampant within the military itself.

So long as the apathetic state of the people continues so will

the war.

The time to sit passively and watch has passed. Now is

the time for responsible action to end the war in Vietnam.

Servicemen and civilians are working together to end this war

for the first time in history. show your support for the servicemen today.

I was told that BERRY GODFREY was in touch

with BILI CIAY today. CLAY claims that there have beer

the beginnings of some right wing activities at UCSD.

He said that the SDS there tried to stage a protest

against the Marine Corps Recruiter which was scheduled

to come to the campus.

He said one SDS member dragged

an American flag across the quad and for his efforts was

beaten up by a couple of members of a new right wing

group at the school.

The SDS had planned to protest the number of

Negro Marines who have been killed in Vietnam, however

the Marine Corps sat a Negro Recruiter to the school

which really threw water on their plans.

According to CLAY it appears that a real confrontation

may be brewing between the conservative and radical students

at UCSD. It was also learned that CLAY now has his private

pilots license.

It has

3 also ben learned that BERRY. GODFREY and .

other members of the Minutemen group may be present at the

SMC march and rally on 11/1/70.

I was in contact with PETER REPLINGER last

Saturday.

He told me he has agreed to take charge

of all the Minutemen records which are presently being

kept by BERRY GODFREY. PETER Is getting ready for his

upcoming wedding and consequently has not been to active

lately.

I have noticed that someone has been painting

a number of pro-Minutemen slogans on bridge abutments

- and overpasses around the La Mesa and El. Cajon area.

lately.

I had a chance to talk to BILL CLAY this

morning. He is still upset about MELVIN CRAIN:

He thinks CRAIN is behind a large part of the left

wing activities in the county.

He said he believes

CRAIN has a lot of weapons and ammunition stored away

on his Hollyoaks Ranch in Harbison Canyon.

CLAY also mentioned that KENNETH GOFF waS

In town yesterday. He said GoFF was and probably

still is a close assoclate of de PuGH. CLAY said

GorE is sort of a religious fanatic.

He suspects

GOFF may have concealed DE PUGH forahile when DE

PUGH was in hiding. He said GOFF was here to speak

to a group of right wing people and said about 40

individuals attended the speech.

CLAY said GOFF told him of the existance

of a left wing revolutionary army which is operating

In this country.

He said this army uses the name

"Largo"

and allegedly obtains its orders and instructions by

code through a IV Program named "Dark Shadows"

said the code used is supposed to be based on the sixth

and seventh chapters of one of the books of Moses in the

bible, which is somehow inserted into the W program's

script. He also said there have been references to "Largo"

Attached are copies of some new Minutemen

stickers and posters which the local group has been

putting out.

They are supposedly printed by Alex

Rapid Print In La Mesa. They are being mailed out to

rany people and are also handed out locally around town.

It is known that BETTIE HOUGHTON was In contact

wIth BARRY GODFREY last night. She was very excited about

the posters and stickers and said she was very glad to see

some

activities getting started.

some of her contacts and group and said that the new posters

and stickers had caused such a flury in town that the whole

Minutemen organization might really get going again.

She said LOU CONDE had apparently received some of the

stickers and posters and was excited about them. It looks

as though there are many people just sitting around waiting

for something Ilke this to happen so they could get involved.

It was aiso learned that BETTIE Gave GODFREY

some plates with which to make some big Minutemen posters.

She also said she has nearly 500 negatives which can be

use to make plates for printing posters and leáflets.

I had a chance to talk to BILL CLAY again.

He maintained that there may have been some correction

between DAVIS and ISSAC CANTRELL aWhile ago. CANTRELL

is the one who was arrested by local and federal authorities

Ior unlawful possession and manufacture of automatic

weapons.

NOVEMBER 18, 1970

BY JEROME

The photo of JAMES RICHARD BUSS is totally un

familiar to me and I don't believe I have ever seen this

individual before.

His name is also not familiar to me.

I was fairly well acquainted with STEPHAN SMITH.

He was in the San Diego area for a period of approximately

a year and left six to eight months ago. I was told that

he went back north, which I assume to mean Los Angeles or

San Francisco.

SMITH was married and lived with his wife at Rancho

Bernardo while he was in this area.

He was very involved in

the Right vs Left confrontation, which took place in Poway

last year over the make up of the Poway School Board. He was

Involved there with colonel SHIP, the NORMANS, and other

people who were opposed to DaNIEL

PREDOVICH aS

School Board

Chairman and some of whom who were considering ways of getuing

rid of PREDOVICH.

While SMITH was in this area, he was closely associated

with known members of the Minutemen organization, such as MICHAEI

VEJBODA, PAUL RUPLINGER and LOU CONDE. I do not know If SMITH

Is or was a memper oi the Minutemen organizationg put 1t not,

be was not a member in name only as he appeared to be in tota

agreement with the far Right extremist, radical, political

philosophies of VEdBODA,

RUP LINGER and CONDE.

SMITH'S wife

was also extremely Right Wing and on one occasion helped pass

out Minutemen organization leaflets. SMITH was involved as a

partner with LOU CONDE in a business, which was named DIGISCAN.

DIGISCAN was supposed to have been an electronics research and

manufacturing outfit,

the main purpose of which was to develop

sell a police communications system whereby each individual

police oilicer could, at all times, be in constant touch with

some police base station. SMITH and CONDE apparently had a

quarrel about the business and split up, and I believe there

may be a law suit pending over ownership of some of the equip

ment, which belonged to the company.

## Page 931

As a sidelight, SMITH would build monitoring and

"bugging" devices for a price.

He also had electronic equip-

ment for use in searching buildings and other places for

hidden electronic monitoring devices or "bugs".

I heard recently that MICHAEL VEJBODA is presently

living in Salt Lake Cityo

There is to be a big gun show in Campo on the

Weekend oI November 21, and 22, 1970, and from the talk I

have heard, it sounds as though it will be a regular gather-

ing of the Minutemen organization and other Right Wingers in

this area.

JERRY GETER, I know, will be there with weapons

to show and sello

BENVY, the barber who has all the machine guns

and rifles in his barber shop, is located on the west side

of 30th Street, about 1& blocks north of El Cajon Boulevard.

I was in contact with SAM DAVIS last Saturday

evening.

For some reason he was quite upset and was talking

about making plans for a tactical squad of six or so individuals

with which to harhoss and terrorize left wing sympathizers in

the San Diego area.

He said he wanted to have a meting this".

coming Friday evening to try to map out some strategy. In

particular, he seems to want to conduct a raid on MELVIN CRANE's

ranch. He

said he would shoot the Doserman Pincers CRANE has

guarding the place, ransack the house then burn it down.

He was also talking about another place in Harbison

canyon, I will try to get the address later, where he claims

Communist Party meetings are being neid.

Among others, he claims

that SI CASADY and DOROTHY HEALEY (phonetic) have ceen

meeting

there. He says he wants to raid that place too.

He was also talking about a 'Doc Roberts" who he says

has many weapons contacts and who may have access to machine

later on hand grenades. He may put me in touch with this person

• I have also been talking to FRANK YACOPEC: YACOPEC

says he has learned of a possible existence of some bunkers

which were buried and abandoned cy General PATTON at the start

of the second world war. He says the bunkers are supposed to

still be full of ammunition and explosives. He claimed he

was told of the existence of the bunkers by a former aide of

General PATTON. He told me that he, BILL CLAY and BARRY GODFREY

may fly up to the location at a later date and look it over.

Apparently these bunkers are located somewhere in the desert

east of 29 Palms.

I was also in touch with PETER RUPLINGER on Saturday.

He stated he has obtained 50 hand grenade fuses and wants to

go to Los Angeles to buy 50 hand grenade casings ana he will

then activate the hand grenades. PETER claimed he has a friend

who works at the Frontier Gun Shop in San Diego who is a

right wing individuals and is selling unregistered ammunition

and firearms. PETER has been carrying a is caliber revolver

lately.

I also learned that SAM DAVIS has an unknown quantity

of expendable rocket launchers with rounds which he will sell

for $25 each.

He is supposed to se looking for anti-tank

DAVIS apparently

has a brother who is also very militant and is working with him.

I am supposed to see BETTIE HOUGATON this evening.

She will put out 500 of the new posters and stickers (see

I was in contact with MARGE MC NICKLES at

Julian last Wednesday and talked to her for about three

We discussed DE PUGH's status.

She said that

representatives of the Minutemen organization and the

Patriotic Party have been talking to former Chief of

Police REDDIN at Los Angeles alleging that DE PUGH IS

innocent of the bank robbery conspiracy charges on

which he was recently convicted.

She said she was

told REDDIN is sufficiently convinced of the possibility

Of DE PUGH's innocence that he may search out evidence

In this regard on which to base a program for his

television show.

She also talked about a JIM MOORE who she said

Is in California and is on one of MC NICKLES' mailing

Iist.

She also mentioned an older man in Los Angeles

named FREED who is a leader of the Patriotic Party. She

said that DE PUGH's mother is also a Patriotic Party

leader and told me that DE PUGH has asked GLENN JACKSON,

of Los Angeles, to resign as co-National Patriotic

Party Chairman.

MC NICKLES said that she herself is Secretary-

Treasurer of the Western Region of the Patriotic Party

which covers ll states. She said in the event of a

split in the Patriotic Party between DE PUGH and JACKSON,

she will side with dE PUGH.

She said she has the bank

account and the membership list for the western Region

of the Patriotic Party in her possession.

She also. told me that the Minutemen National

Headquarters continues to function under BOB DE PUGH, JR.,

and RAMONA VAN DE PUGH. She sald there is a courier

traveling between Los Angeles and the Minutemen National

Heaâquarters weekly.

She asked that her son, DAN T. MC NICKLES,

a student at San Diego State College, be used at

Right Wing activities and made arrangements for me

• to meet him this evening at 8:00 p.m., In La Mesa.

MC NICKLES told me there is a woman living

in the Julian commune and said

she has seen others

coming and going there. She gave me the license

numbers of two more of

the cars she has seen at the

commune.

One was an out of state license, white back-

ground with blue figures XVC 316, which was on a dark

green car with white racing stripes, possibly a Mustang,

which was at the commune on October 11, 1970. The

other was a tan over brown Volkswagen bus with California

license MHD 097 which was at the commune on November 2,

On Friday I saw BILL CLAY and told him about

MARCE MC NICKLES.

I asked him if he thought we should

try to use her to re-establish contact with the Minute-

men National Headquarters.

CLAY said' "I don't know.

We'll have to ask SAM about that. "

I was definitely

impressed from the way he made the statement that perhaps

he has been taking orders in the Minutemen organization

frOm SAM DAVIS all along.

We then went together to see DAVIS and discussed

MC NICKLES with him. He said that we should continue

talking with MC NICKLES to see what contact with her

would

produce.

CLAY. and DAVIS then got to talking

breaking DE PUGH out of jail at Albuquerque and

• I related to them what MC NICKLES had told me before

about going to Alaquerque to visit DE PUGH. CLAY and

DAVIS became very upset and jumped all over me because

I had not told them about MC NICKIES being there and

about knowing the layout of the Albuquerque City Jail.

After this they started talking idley about

getting DE PUGH out of prison at Fort Levenworth.

DAVIS then stated he had seen DENNIS MOWER not

too long ago and at that time MOWDER was hiding out a

girl who was allegedly a former secretary for dE PUGH.

He said MOWIER told him that for some reason DE PUGH had

people looking for this girl to kill her and that also

she was being sought by the FBI.

DAVIS continued talking and indicated the

possibillty he. hold a higher position in the Minute-

men organization in the State of California than we

previously suspected. He said he has been using the

some of his other contacts and

Minutemen activities.

CLAY then mentioned a former San Diego area

Minuteman named ED ANDREWS who he thought had always

been very reliable. He said he had previously understood

ANDREWS to be somewhere in the State of Arkansas but

said VIC WAITON had told him that ANDREWS was back at

Ramona, California, some time ago.

They also talked about HOWARD CLARK as a

reliable Minuteman member. He also apparently lives

at Ramona and is employed at Convair.

MC NICKLES IS

also well acquainted with CLARK and they said we should

uSe CLARK as a reference to MC NICKLES to gain her

confidence.

CLAY and DAVIS want to have another meeting

soon for the purpose of setting up a schedule or list

of

targets in the San Diego area to hit in the event it

appears that a communist or other totalitarian takeover

in this country appears imminent.

From my contact

with CLAY and DAVIS it appears that there has been

considerable improvement in

the communications and

coordination among the Right Wings in this area.

Additionally, regarding my contact with MC NICKLES,

she told me she is Neo-Nazi. She also said she is

in contac: with JOSEPH BRINKER and also said that HENNING

VON BECK is in town.

She said he is the son of a General

VON BECK who was in the German army and was executed at

the Nurenberg trials. She said he told her that last

week some one fired

a rifle bullet through the windshield

of his automobile and regularly gets letters from Jews

announcing they are out to get him..

She also told me that the local telephone

Installer at Julian, a man 40 - 45 years old, is also

a Minuteran and that he checks her telephone for her

to determine if it is being bugged.

My parents, who just recently returned

from Hawail, told me about a person named ANTHONY

KAO they had been in contact with while in Hawaii.

They said KAO owns and operates a business named

Fashion Wig Imports which is located in the Ala Moana

Building on Wanaao Place in Kailua, Hawaii.

They said KAO made a number of statements

which were anti-United States and pro-communist China

in nature:

They said KAO, who is Chinese, is closely

REPORT BY JEROME

JANUARY 4, 1971

He was In contact with GEORGE HOOVER yesterday

who apparently has not been doing much of anyching. He

also saw JERRY GIER last night who claimed he has made

contact with a Minutemen group at Los Angeles which 1s

Involved in buying and selling weapons. He told many

about some new Minutemen business cards which are coming

out of los Angeles. We got around to talking about hand

grenades and GETER sald that although he did not openly

solicit hand grenades for money, he would obtain some for

money If he happened to run across any.

I am not

aware of anyone connected with the

Minutemen organization placing Minutemen stickers and posters

around MORRIS STARSKY's apartment

house or on his car.

However, people like LOU CONDE, FRANK YACOPEC and the

RUPLINGERS are always good suspects in things like that.

REPORT BY JEROME

JANUARY 7, 1971

151

I was talking with GEORGE HOOVER day before

yesterday. We discussed an Idea which he and SAM DAVIS

have had regarding setting up a Civil War Confederate

skirmish group similar to other such groups which have

been established in other parts of the country. This

grOup WIll be set up by HOOVER, DAVIS, STAN MCDADE, (INU)

MARTINI of the Accuracy Gun Shop, FRANK YACOPEC and BARRY

GODFREY. It is expected as many as 50 or 60 other individuals

may join the skirmish group, some who will be rightwing.

oriented people and may who will be just plain gun nuts.

These will Include JERRY GEIER, ROGER WILLIS and others

probably including some from the Patch and Ball Gun Shop

crowd.

I have also learned that GEORGE HOOVER and SAM

DAVIS have three operational Civil War field artillery

pieces which are located on ROGER WIIIIS' Gunsmoke Ranch

property in Harbison Canyon and may actually belong to

him. STAN MCDADE is building a 4th artillery piece. He

has the gun carriage assembly and has ordered the barrel

for the weapon..

jerome

INTA

55009 DocId: 32989524 Page 950

---

## Page 951

According to HOOVER, the beauty of organizing

such a skirmish group is that it will allow the right

wingers

and Minutemen to use the group as an above ground

organization and to openly drill and train with weapons.

Members would have their own uniforms and the organization

would be set up in a milltary fashion with officers, ranks,

etc., assigned to the members. Persons joining the

organization will be protected from police and other

outside harassment by being assigned the name of an actual

CIvil war officer or soldier to use while they are participating

In the organization's activities. The existence of the

organization will also give the right wingers an excuse to

have large quantities of black powder and percussion caps

on hand to use for their weapons.

In addition the organization could be used to

provide an honor guard to be present at local appearances

of right wing speakers and to set up counter-demonstrations

against left wing activities.

This skirmish group would be controlled and direct-

ed by an underground nucleus of. 6 or 8 solid Minutemen members

who are not generally known to other members of the skirmish

group.

HOOVER and DAVIS are apparently becoming less

Interested in BILL CLAY as a member and participant in right

wing activities. According to them, he is too busy now

adays with his own personal affairs to be of much use.

For this reason, they have said they don't want him in the

underground group of Minuteman members who will direct

the Civil War skirmish.

It has come to my attention that JERRY BUSCH

has fallen out of favor with most of the Minutemen members

who do not like or trust him. SAM DAVIS has even threatened

to shoot him: GEORGE HOOVER still likes him though and

BUSCH spends most of his weekends at the Gunsmoke Ranch with

HOOVER and WILLIS. Could their be a romance brewing?

:..

I was at Jullan today talking to MARGE

MC NICKLES.

She said she had sent a letter to one of

my Post Office Boxes asking me to come and see her.

She said it looked as though there had been another

split in the Minutemen organization, and

showed me a

bulletin which she had received from what looks like

a new Minutemen group.

The bulletin was printed on

the original Minutement letterhead paper and was

marked December 15, 1970. She said she received the

bulletin. about a week ago.

Regarding the bulletin, MC NICKLES said that

In the past there was always talk about DE PUGH and

other people in the Minutemen

organization regarding

an Executive Committee of advisors to DE PUGH.

According

to the bulletin, It had been sent out by that

Executive

Committee and announced that during the month of December

or 19r0, no date given,

there had been a meeting of

Regional Coordinators of the Minutemen organization at

Chicago, Illinois.

The bulletin said the Executive

Committee was gratified at the large attendance at the

meeting and went on to announce that control of the

Minutemen organization was being taken away from DE PUGH

and

the res; of the National Headquarters Group at

Norborne, Missouri. The bulletin said this action was

being taken as it had been learned that funds of the

Minutemen organization had been mis-used, that halucinatory

drugs had been purchased and that effective leadership

was lacking at the Norborne Headquarters.

The bulletin said that DE PUGH and his

associates should no longer be considered as part of

the Minutemen organization. The bulletin advised that

• all Minutemen literature which had not been copyrighted

was being re-printed and was always available for

distribution.

grosse

NW 55009 DocId: 32969524

Page 956

## Page 957

- She said the copyrighted Minutemen Ilterature

was being reviewed for changes so as to avoid the

copyright and would been be re-printed.

The bulletin also advised that as a result

of the December meeting the country had been divided

Into ten regions with a Regional Coordinator appointed

The bulletin said that the Regional Coordinator

the individual member's contact with the

National Headquarters. The bulletin had a return

address of Post Office Box 096, Elgin, Illinois, with

a note that

the second

address

appearing on the

bulletin

was that of the receiving members Regional Coordinator.

The note went on to say that if no second address

appeared on the bulletin the receiving member was to

send all Minutemen organization mail to the Elgin,

Illinois, address from where it would be forwarded

to the Regional Coordinator.

There was no second

address on MC NICKLES' Copy of the bulletin.

Enclosed with the bulletin were a number of

the original Minutemen report forms which are to be filled

out and returned. Also enclosed were a number of the

origional Minutemen application forms which are suppose

to be distributed to interested

persons.

MC NICKLES told me

she has heard of several

other people (no names given) in our area who also

received the bulletin.

She said, however, that apparently

none of the JOHN ZEMANEC-GLENN JACKSON grOUp at Los

Angeles got them.

with regard to DE PUGH, MC NICKLES told me

that the charges against him in the State of Washington

have been thrown out of court for lack of evidence.

MC NICKTES said she communicates regularly with DE PUGH'S

wife and received a letter from her not too long ago

which requested more monéy for DE PUGH's legal defense..

She said, however,

there has been no visible action in

this regard and pointed out that the above described

bulletin implied that DE PUGH's wife is "blowing" the

money which is being received for his defense.

gerome

NW 55009 DocId: 32989524 Page 957

## Page 958

She said she has also heard a rumor to the

effect that DE PUGH's wife is running around on him

while he is in prison, but she said she does not believe

this is true.

NC NICKLES said DE PUGH's wife had previously

mentioned

a person named JESSE STEPHENS who may possibly

be connected with the group at Elgin, Illinois.

She said STEPHENS supposedly started a Right

wing group some years ago, possibly in the Northwest

but was never recognized by DE PUGH.

She said she does not know if STEPHENS is

actually connected

with the Elgin, Illinois, group.

I will send a letter to the group at Elgin, :

ILlinois, regarding whau

their plans are.

I will use

the name JERRY MORAN and the Post Office Box Number 76

at spring valley, California.

The

leaflet invites people to come to hear about Cuba "after the

revolution" from people who have gone

on the Venceremos

Brigades.

The speech is to take nace at 7:30 p.m. in Room MC

201. and indicated there would be speakers and slides.

According

to the leaflet, it was put out by a group named the Revolutionary

Action Caucus.

I have not been in contact with LOU CONDE in some-

time;

however, I understand he is still politically active

especially in the group named Taxpayers Concerned.

PAUL

REPLINGER is still in regular contact with CONDE.

CONDE has always had a reputation as a "blabber

mount"

, but actually only talks about little things which

are not very important. CONDE is a clever, dynamic, ambitious

and hardworking person. He has a lot of money and is very

willing to put some of it into right wing activities.

CONDE has many Cuban exile contacts and is a Cuban

himself. In particular, he is close to the Alpha 66 group

and can get them out to do things for him..

CONDE is in very tight with the local tuna boat

association and I would imagine he also has many contacts

among the shrimpers and tuna sievers.

This is because he

has a marine engine and shipfitting business and does much

work for the fishing. boats.

: It is entirely likely that CONDE may be involved in

some way with Illegal arms shipments on some of these fishing

boats between here and some latin American countries. If this

is happening, I doubt that the weapons are coming to the

United States through the Latin American countries, but are

probably being purchased here and shipped to Cuban guerrilla

organizations in Central and South America. It is also possible

that CONDE may secretly be doing some work to arm some of the

tuna boats to protect them against seizure by such countries

as Peru and Ecuador. He mentioned something about this to me

about a year ago.

It looks as though I may be going to the Gunsmoke

Ranch this coming weekend.

They're going to have a pistol

shoot there with quite a few people attending. Last weekend

they had a shotgun shoot at skeet. The group at the Gunsmoke

ON JANUARY 18, 1971, BY JEROME

I have learned that sometime ago, FRANK YACOPEC

and JERRY TARTAGLIO were in contact with a retired Army

colonel who claimed he was some kind of an aide to General

PATTON, or otherwise connected with him, when PATTON was

Involved in desert maneuvers and training in the Palm Springs,

California, area at about the beginning of the second world

war.

According to what this colonel said, PATTON and his

troops received urgent orders requiring them to pack up and

ship out to go overseas with only two days notice. Because

of

such short notice, rather than taking their heavy equipment

and supplies with them, they simply abandoned and buried them

inmolesale quantities.

I understand that many trucks and

tanks were part in ravines and gullies and dirt was bulldozed

over them.

There are a lot of recorded instances where people

have found such buried supplies in the desert out beyond

Palm Springs.

This area is still all Government property

that is very

little inhabited any any time. Apparently the

Government has either lost its records, forgotten about; or

simply doesn't care about all the stuff that is supposed to

be buried out there.

In particular, this colonel told YACOPEC and TARTAGLIO

about a large concrete bunker with big double steer doors which

he said was filled with ammunitions and explosives and also

buried.

He apparently told TARTAGLIO and YACOPEC how to locate

the bunker and I understand that they went out to the desert

• and after digging through about six feet of sand, actually

round the steel doors to the bunker. Following this, they

covered the bunker up again and have not been back since.

On the 27th of this month, a group Including YACOPEC,

BARRY GODFREY and PETER REPLINGER are going to go out to the

desert to try and relocate the bunker and dig it out. I

understand that REPLINGER has access to a portable jackhammer

and some other heavy equipment which he will use to dig out

the bunker.

If It 1s at all possible, I will try and go along

with them to see what they actually find.

I was at the Gunsmoke Ranch in Harbison Canyon

yesterday. When I got there, there were already 15 people

present, most of whom I did not know and as I was leaving,

three more peoples STAN MC DADE and his two sons, arrived.

While I was there, I got to talking to SAM DAVIS about

HOWARD CLARK who lives at Ramona.

DAVIS stated he felt he could

trust CLARK completely and backed this up saying. that CLARK iS

storing some weapons for him. DAVIS said he had also been working

on some machine guns with CLARK at Ramona at one time an acted

to go to court that morning to answer charges on three traffic

warrants.

DAVIS also told me he will be going up to Mud River,

Idaho, sometime in the early part of this summer with several

other people to live.

He said he will give me his address there

when it becomes available to him as he wants to stay in touch

with me.

It appears this may be a Minutemen commune he has been

talking about starting for several months now.

ON JANUARY 26, 1971, BY JEROME

This morning I answered an ad in the newspaper

and purchased a .22 calibre Remington rifle for $20.00.

I bought the gun from a Negro individual by the name of

MAURY (ph) (LNU) who is presently residing at 5880 University,

Apartment #9. He looked to me to be in his late 20's, about

5' 9" tall and slender and was wearing a goatee beara and

very much, both in physical

He told me he had just moved to San Diego from Los

Angeles and is looking for work.

While I was at his apartment, I noticed he had large

quantities of Black Panther and other black militant literature,

Including books by ELDRIDGE CLEAVER and copies of the Black

Panther Party newspaper.

In addition to the .22 calibre rifle, he also had

in his possession a •32 calibre automatic pistol which is

cheap imitation of the French MAB and is made in Spain.

It has been learned that there is a San Diego Police

Department officer named BOB SISK who claims he is a member of

the Minutemen organization.

I was in contact with GILBERT MC GILL Sunday. He is

still employed at the Telephone Company. He told me he has

been helping to tap some telephone lines and that it is still

a common practice for Telephone Company employees to listen in

on telephone conversations in the san Diego area.

Regarding the possibility of a big Minutemen meeting

during the middle of December, 1970, I was unable to get in

touch with BILI CLAY during almost the entire last half of

December and it is possible he may have gone to the Chicago

meeting. It is also possiblo that SAM DAVIS may have gone as

I am frequently unable to contact him for several days at a

time.

on 2/16/71.

The leaflet indicated that persons interested

The leaflet stated that SMC desired to obtain

the signatures of enough people so that during the period

2/10/71 - 2/19/71, 20 persons per hour could be assigned

to be present at the draft board for harassment purposes.

• The leaflet indicated that there are many lega.

forms of harassment which should be engaged in such as

sexist and racist or to flood the place with tears

asking that their boy friends, brothers, etc., be

exempted from the draft.

The name RONALD TIMOTHY DOMENICK Or DOMINIC iS

you gave me sounds like an individual who hangs around

with FORREST and some of the other gun people. .

I also have heard a rumor before that FORREST is

operating some kind of a shop on the Mexican boarder and

FORREST allegedly deals in a lot of illegal stuff.

FORREST has had two large boats and lost both

of them.

There. is a story around which I believe is

probably true that his second boat was bombed as a result

of a quarrel or something over smuggling. I have never

heard anything about him having any hand grenades on the

boat but he may have had some kind of high explosives

I contacted the

as he had

requested:

We made arrangements to meet together at

the Denny's Restaurant in El Cajon. I plan to have

SAM DAVIS Or GEORGE HOOVER or both there to watch

the meeting and make sure nothing funny happens.

The person I talked to on the telephone gave

me what he said was

his Minuteman Serial Numoer

subsequently checked this number with BETTIE HOUGHTON

who said the number is a good one and falls within a

block of numbers which she said she knows was legitimately

Issued. She said she has access to some files which

may include this number so that possibly she can find

out who the person is.

While I was making the call I had FRANK YACOPEC

watching the telephone booth up at Alpine.

FRANK pretended

to have a flat tire by stopping about a half a mile down

the soad from the telephone booth where he let some air

out of one of his tires. He then drove his car to an air

at a service station near the telephone booth where

he was able to watch the person who received the call.

After the call was over he followed this individual to

a side street named Marshall Road. When he got to the

road and looked the person nad aisappeared.

He said there

were only two cars on the road which looked like they

had been driven recently which had the following license

plate numbers:

WAB 703

• and

YCB 714

obtained the following information:

He said that one PAUL HUNT at Santa Monica,

California, is the person who is actually in charge of

the Minutemen in the state of California or at least

In that area and he has been so in charge since the

disappearance of TROY HOUGHTON. He added that DENNIS

MOWER is only a public figurehead and added that he

с остеле

thinks PAUL HUNT is a vesy dangerous man.

On the subject of TROY HOUGHTON, I have learned

Irom both DAVIS and BILI CLAY that HOUGHTON's contacts

may have been much more widely spread than I thought.

specilically, they told me that HOUGHTON was behind ar

attempt several years ago by 18 "hunters" in the State

of New York to conduct sabotage and terrorist attacks

on New Left Groups..

These 18 individuals were supposedly

arrested and a large quantity of weapons and ammunition

was confiscated.

I also talked some more with DAVIS about TOM

FORREST and it appears that they know each other extremely

well. DAVIS said he had some ousiness dealings with

FORREST involving some machine guns and other items.

DAVIS apparently has decided not to get rid

of as much of his explosives and so forth as he originally

said.

He has a snall quantity of I.N.I. and also some

C4 Plastic explosives which he will sell at $10 a pound

which is too high a price.

He said he can also obtain a military weapon

which Is like a bazooka and has a self-contained 3.5"

rocket sound in an expendable launcher. He said the price

of this is $25.

Dear Senator Goldwater:

The enclosed clipping appeared on page 23 of the Tucson

Daily Citizen fo= October 2, 1972. As a loyal American

citizen, hunter and member of the National Rifle Associ

ation, I resent the implications of this arcicle. The

idea that à typical member "likes guns....." is just

the soit of reasoning that the communists use in all

their propaganda. The fact that it comes fion a Govern

ment Agency is cause for concern.

Perhaps the Minutemen

are right in suggesting that there

is a Communisi-Socialist clique in governuent, tre In-

ternal Revenue Service máght be the place io luok for it

at that.

I hope you can bring this problem to the attention of

the proper authority.

Respectfully yours,

1 - Mx. D. W. Dalbey

1 - Mr. W. C. Patterson

This is to confirm that on September 21, 1972,

Kevin I. Maroney, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Internal

Security Division, advised Special Agent William C. Patterson

of this Bureau that authority was granted for Special Agent

Arthur J. Hooper to testify in Superior Court, San Diego County,

San Diego, California, in the trial of William Francis Yakopec.

Yakopec, a member of the white extremist Secret Army

Organization, is charged with attempted murder. A defense witness,

Calvin Rendell Fox, has

testified the FBI on May 18, 1972, planted

in his business files a letter from the Secret Army Organization

indicating acceptance of Fox as a Secret Army Organization member.

mits

Mr. Maroney was made aware of the proposed testimony

to be given by Special Agent Hooper which concerns the actions of

Special Agent Hooper while conducting investigation at Fox's

business establishment on May 18, 1972, and which refutes the

allegation of Fox that a letter was planted in his personal files

by the FBI. MI. Maroney authorized Special Agent Hooper's

testimony in line with the above. If Special Agent Hooper is

questioned concerning other than as discussed, he is to advise

that in accordance with Code of Federal Regulations, Title 28,

Section 16.12, such information acquired while in the performance

of official duties as a Special Agent of the FBI cannot be

disclosed unless approved by the Attorney General. Additional

NOTE:

William Francis Yakopec, a member of the paramilitary,

ultraconservative, anticommunist Secret Army Organization (SAO), is

on trial in Superior Court, San Diego County, San Diego, California,

on a charge of attempted murder. As indicated above, defense

witness Calvin Hendell Fox has alleged the FBI planted a document

in his personal files on 5/18/72. Fox in May, 1972, was identified

by former Bureau informant Howard Barry Godfrey as one of the most

rabid and violent new members of the SAO. Godfrey furnished infor-

mation that Fox, immediately after the attempted assassination of

Presidential candidate George Wallace, indicated he was going to

Washington, D. C., to do some demonstrating of his own.

Investi-

gation was

instituted to ascertain description and license number

of Fox's automobile and other background information in order to

carry out responsibilities regarding protection of Presidential

candidates and high Government officials.

SA Arthur J. Hooper

and

former SA Steven I. Christensen on 5/18/72 made inquiry at Fox's

service station and an employee of Fox looked through Fox's file

cabinet in an attempt to obtain the license number of Fox's auto-

mobile. There is no indication documents in this file cabinet were

extensively examined by the Agents or that anything was placed in

these files. San Diego teletype 9/21/72 contained SA Hooper's

proposed testimony which will refute Fox's testimony. This matter

has been coordinated with SA James I. Williamson, Office of Legal

Counsel.

NOTE CONTINUED:

San Diego, California. Calvin Hendell Fox, who has been

identified by former Bureau informant Howard Barry Godfrey as

,a SAO member, was investigated in May, 1972, concerning a trip

he was hurriedly making at that time to Washington, D. C.

Fox, as a defense witness in the Yakopec trial, on 9/18/72

testified he is not a member of the SAO and produced a letter

to him on SAO stationery accepting his application as a SAO

member.

Fox testified the FBI planted this document in his

personal files on 5/18/72.

Fox, in June, 1972, made allegations

that FBI Agents had illegally opened his

personal file cabinet

at his business. A review of this investigation and inquiry

concerning the actions of the Agents indicated this allegation

was false and that an employee of Fox's had opened the file

cabinet and that the Agents had made no examination of

documents in this cabinet.

Referenced teletype set forth

proposed questions and answers regarding SA Hooper's testimony

who conducted investigation at Fox's place of business and who

will refute Fox's testimony.

This matter has been coordinated

with SA James I. Williamson, Office of Legal Counsel.

SA William C. Patterson, on 9/21/72, received instructions set

forth from Kevin I.

Purpose of this memorandum is to obtain authority to

contact Internal Security Division, Department of Justice, concerning

testimony of former Special Agent (SA) Steven I. Christensen, who is

to appear as witness for the prosecution on 9/7/72 in Superior Court,

San Diego County, San Diego, California, in trial of George Mitchell

Hoover, a member of the white extremist Secret Army Organization

(SAO) .

Rand,

sets ilen

Former SA Christensen was assigned to the San Diego Office

and

was handling former extremist informant Howard Barry Godfrey,

a member of the Minutemen and an officer in the SAO. In January,

1972, Godfrey reported that on 1/6/72 SAO member Hoover

fired a

• shöt

into the residence of New Left activist Peter Bohmer which wounded

Paula Tharp. Christensen received this information from Godfrey and

subsequently furnished the information to the San Diego Police

Department (SDPD). Godfrey's identity as the source of the informa-

tion was not furnished the SDPD at that time.

MAINS REC-65

15713577-51

In June, 1972, Godfrey reported that SAO member William

Francis Yakopec was responsible for bombing a san Diego movie theater

on 6/19/72 and was in possession of explosives. Based on information

furnished by the informant Godfrey the SDPD arrested Yakopec,

Hoover

and four other SAO members. Yakopec and Hoover were charged with

attempted murder and possession of explosives. In order to obtain

successful local prosecution of Hoover, Yakopec and the other SAO

members, the informant Godfrey was turned over to the SDPD. Subse-

quently, it was learned the gun used in the shooting of Tharp had

been stolen by Godfrey and that the gun was given to former

SA Christensen after the shooting. The gun was retained in

Christensen's home until turned over to the SDPD one fizi Desi

• Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re: Secret Army Organization

157-23577

Christensen on 7/6/72, after admitting to the Special Agent

in Charge, San Diego, that he had made false entries in the Bureau

records regarding the gun, submitted his resignation. Christensen

indicated he had retained the gun as Godfrey had indicated he did not

desire to testify and therefore was attempting to protect the informant

Godfrey. Although not subject to subpoena as he is residing outside

California, Christensen has tentatively indicated a willingness to

testify in the trial of Hoover.

A list of the prosecution's questions

•to be asked Christensen was furnished (see attached questions) since

information obtained by Christensen while he was an FBI Agent cannot

be revealed in state court without prior authority from the

Department.

This matter has been coordinated with SA James L. Williamson,

Office of Legal Counsel. Questions to be asked by the prosecution

appear to involve no objectionable area. Testimony of Christensen

could possibly cause adverse comments in the news media regarding

his concealment of the gun which had been used in the commission of

a felony. The alternative is not to authorize his appearance which

would have an adverse effect on the prosecution of Hoover. In view

of the above, it is recommended no objection be made to the testimony

of Christensen.

ACTION:

II you approve, Kevin I. Maroney, Deputy Assistant

Attorney General, Internal Security Division of the Department,

will be contacted to obtain authority for the testimony of former

SA Steven I. Christensen on 9/7/72 in Superior Court, San Diego

County, San Diego, California, in line with the above.

History of the Secret Army Organization

One early morning in February, 1970, a group of six Minutemen leaders from

four states met secretly in Northern Arizona to discuss the crisis that the arrest and

imprisonment of two top Minutemen leaders and the assassination of a third had

brought on the organization. Although some of these men had met before in their roles

as Minutemen group leaders, others were meeting for the first time.

After much discussion, two principal points were agreed upon. First, that the

Minutemen as a national coordination organization of militant right-wing groups had

effectively been destroyed by the pro-communist elements inside the Justice Depart-

ment. While individual units still existed throughout the country, few had the financial

support or leadership to be really effective. Second, that the need for such a coordi-

nating organization wasgreater than ever in view of the increased revolutionary activity

by communists in the United States.

With these two points in mind, suggestions were p't forward on a course of

action to be followed.

After ameeting that lasted all that day and far into the next

morning, an overall plan of action was finally agreed upon. All present agreed to

merge their individual units together and form a new organization under the command

of one leader elected from among themselves, with the other five to be members of a

General Staff that would advise and assist the new leader.

While retaining the basic programs and policies of the Minutemen, it was

decided that not only should this new organization have a different name, but also a

completely new chain of command and organizational structure. If the new organiza-

tion was going to survive the attacks that befell the old one, a whole new approach

would be needed. Never again could the arrestor death of a few leaders be allowed to

cripple the entire organization.

For this

reason it was decided that only a highly disciplined military type

orgainization with a definite chain of command would have any chance of success. This

then, was the beginning of the Secret Army Organization. Beginning with an original

force of hard corepatriots that numbered fewer than two hundred, the Secret Army

Organization began thejob of picking up the pieces and continuing to fight for national

and individual freedom. Using this cadre of dedicated personnel as a nucleus, the

S. A. O. has been recruiting and training new members in the skills they will need as

the freedom fighters of tomorrow.

The leaders of the S. A. O. have no idea of fighting a last ditch stand. We have

no desire to commit suicide ourselves or to let our members do so. We have a

strategy which we believe will ultimately lead to victory. Only one thing is essential.

We must start preparing and training NOW! We of the S. A. O. believe that our country

is worthy of any sacrifice. If you feel the same way, we invite you to join us.

-GENERAL HEADQUARTERS:

A

Dear Fellow American,

Your application for membership in the Secret Army Organization has been

processed and approved. It is our profound hope that your membership inthe

S.A. O. will prove to be a benefit to the organization and yourself as well. A

dedicated member will find that his association with our organization is a way of

life that is far more rewarding than the ordinary mediocre existence of his fellow

enlightened citizens.

For security purposes all records regarding individual members are listed

by numbers only. Your number will be

— Please sign all future

- correspondence addressed to the organization with this number. You need not list.

your address unless it is different from the one in our records.

Another security measure employed by our organization is the use of mail

drops. •The mail drop is an address listed in a fictitious name of a person or

company not connected with the organization. Each member is assigned one that

he will use in sending all reports, correspondence, materials, etc., to the organ-

ization. Your assigned mail drop is:

We have a tremendous job_ahead of us: Certainly, none of us pretend to

know what the future holds for ourselves or for our native land. We do feel, how-

ever, that our freedom is gravely threatened. It is not always possible to know

the best thing to do. But we do know this - our forefathers have given us a life of

freedom and opportunity such as never existed before in all history. We must

strive to pass this heritage on to future generations intact.

Our organization is not suggesting or doing anything more than Americans

have always done - starting in 1776.

Enclosed is some further information about our organization, its history,

"objectives, and programs. Your record has been turned over to our training sec-

tion and you should receive your first training program within two weeks.

• Sincerely yours,

Captain Patrick McDonald

To

spective Members Of The

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

The Secret Army Organization is the most active, most completely dedicated and

most selective in its membership of all the many patriotic organizations in America.

We are willing to make any sacrifice for our country and we fully expect that some of

us will have to make the ultimate sacrifice before victory is achieved. Our very lives

depend on each other. There is no place in this organization for bunglers, playboys or

lukewarm conservatives. If you join the Secret Army Organization, there might easily

come a time that your life would depend on how competently some other member had

learned his job.

Unless you are especially well informed on the domestic and world political

situation, it is probable that you have a lot to learn about the present threat our nation

faces. Unless you have had many years experience in actual underground warfare,

there is undoubtedly a lot you can learn from the experts in our organization who have

developed and supervised our training program.

OUR NATION IS IN IMMEDIATE DANGER

It is possible that within a very few years, perhaps even within months, our

nation could be conquered and enslaved by the communists. To prevent this we must

know as much as possible about our enemies. Unless we know who they are and what

they are doing we will not succeed in our efforts to maintain a free America.

THE RESISTANCE MOVEMENT

In driving an' invader from your land the resistance involved goes through three

stages of development.

1) The Underground Network

2) Active Guerrilla Warfare

3) Open or Conventional Warfare

The conventional warfare stage uses everything in the way of weapons that the

enemy does but must also have active guerrillas and underground agents working against

the enemy, too. In the present state of military tactics conventional warfare cannot

succeed unless these other two ingredients are used simultaneously.

The first step is to form an underground network. An active guerrilla system

must have the support of an underground network of approximately three times its own

size.

This underground must supply the active guerrilla fighter with supplies, con-

cealment, information, etc. An underground network starts with departments of

intelligence, security and propaganda in that order.

Sabotage, espionage, subversion, infiltration, escape and evasion, training,

clandestine fabrication of supplics, counterfeiting enemy documents, recruiting, com-

munications and propaganda are other phases of underground activity. Each member

of the Secret Army Organization, to be effective, must have a working knowledge of

all these tactics as well as the military tacties more commonly associated with guerril-

la activities.

ASSIGNMENT TO UNITS

"Many people that inquire about membership in the Secret-Army-Organization

seem to have an idea that they will be immediately accepted into an active unit.

Look at it this way. Suppose you had spent a year or more carefully recruiting and

training until you had a hard hitting team where every individual was reliable, dedi-

-cated, and had confidence in his fellow unit members. Wouldn't it make you mad to

have the national or regional organization assign some rank amateur to your unit

-that you you knew little or nothing about?

Before any new member is assignedto an active unit or to an important under-

ground project, he mistundergo a period of training. During this training he will be

directed through the mails by an experienced member and some of his activities may

be observed by other members without his knowledge. Only when a new member

proves himself to be conscientious, trustworthy, self-disciplined and able to operate

effectively alone will he be accepted as a "secure member" and invited to participate

with other unit memhers in a teamwork operation.

-EXPENSES

Unfortunately, most good things don't come cheap. Although we make every

effort to keep down the expense of membership in the Secret Army Organization, you

- must expect to pay your own way.

Dues to the Secret Army Organization are $3. 00 per month. This money is

absolutely necessary for use to maintain our central files and headquarters,

for

postage and printing, to finance our extensive intelligence network, and to maintain

training areas.

Each member will have other expenses depending on the type of activity he is

• engaged in. Every member will be expected to buy his own gun, ammunition and

other basic combat equipment. During training the new member may be expected to

buy certain books or subscribe to certain magazines that his work requires. During

•this time the new member will also be supplied with reading material on the strategy

and tactics of guerrilla warfare. This home work will make it possible for him to

fit in quickly to an active unit and participate effectively in actual maneuvers,

marksmanship training, etc.

Following this preliminary training a memher may be either assigned to an

existing unit, assisted in organizing his own unit if he has shown sufficient leadership

qualities or become part of an underground network.

Upon your acceptance into the Secret Army Organization you will be given a

definite series of projects described in writing so you will know exactly what will be

expected of you.

We hope that you can succeed in this effort because your country desperately

needs patriots at this time.

GENERAL HEADQUARTERS

JANUARY 1972

"God grants liberty only to those who love it and are always willing to guard and

defend it'.

Daniel Webster

-Fellow members,

This month's bulletin will deal mostly with "Booby Traps". Because of the

length of this article we are only sending out the first half this month. The second

half will be published in next month's bulletin. Future bulletins this coming year

will contain material on psychological warfare, urban warfare tactics, communi-

cations, survival equipment, first aid, explosives, weapons, codes, and other re-

lated warfare subjects.

Those members who have not yet completed or started on the organization's

basic training programs are hereby urged to do so. We cannot, in most eases, = =

assign any member to an important underground project or to an organized team

or group until they have completed this training program.

While headquarters cannot assign a member in the above classification to

an established unit, any member can (and is encouraged to) recruit and form their

own combat team (see December 1971 Bulletin). In many cases this may be the

best policy in regards to personal security as the member would be working with

the people he personally knows and trusts. If any member would like to form their

own unit they should write to their assigned mail drop and the organization will send

them further instructions along with a Team Recruiting Packet: The article on

"The Dispersed Team" in this month's bulletin should help those members who

wish to form their own Combat Team.

We are enclosing a small number of S. A. O. stickers with this month's

bulletin. Please put them in your shirt pocket or billfold and as soon as possible

stick them up in phone booths, at bus stops, or other public places that you visit.

The stickers are already gummed and when wet will achere firmly to glass, metal,

or any other smooth surface. It our members would use these stickers along with

the leailets that are available, it would have a real psychological impact on the

rest of the American people and give them evidence that there are still those among

them who are willing to fight for the re-establishment of a Constitutional Republic.

These first stickers are being sent to each member free, additional stickers and

leaflets can be ordered on the monthly report form.

DISPERSED TEAM

When discussing a Secret Army Organization "Combat Team", we usually think

of a small group of people who live very close to one another. Such an arrangement

has certain advantages, such as ease of communication and travel for collective

, training and team operations, but there are also several disadvantages.

Among the disadvantages are these: Team members may be well acquainted

with only a small geographical area. If-forced to leave-this area the team may be

placed at a serious disadvantage. It is harder for a team of SAO members who

live closely together to keep from attracting attention, thus unit security may be

poor. If one o ember of the team is ever discovered and arrested by the enemy,

chances are that all members of the team will be rounded up together.

These considerations have caused us to experiment with a new arrangement that

we refer to as a "Dispersed Team"'. Such a team has the same number of members

(usually six) as a regular Combat Team. Each team is split into two sections as is

the old team. • The members have the same type of individual specialties and duties.

The big difference lies in the fact that the team members may be located over

a comparatively larger area - perhaps as much as 25 to 50 miles in diameter. In

urban areas one team member may live in each of six different cities. Thus the

team may range over a fairly large geographical area with at least one team member.

being familiar with the immediate territory through which they are traveling.

When active as part of an underground movement (as opposed to the classical

forms of guerrilla warfare) the Dispersed Team has several other advantages..

• For example, if one member of the team gets too "hot" in his area, he automatically

has five other hide-outs to which he can go for assistance or to which he can send

his family for temporary safety. The Dispersed Team can conveniently cover a

larger area in the fields of recruiting, psychological warfare, and propaganda.

Operations of sabotage, surveillance and harassment of communist personnel,

raids, and other combat type operations can be successfully conducted while moving

a minimum of people over a minimum distance.

During the present period of deliberate delay the activities of the team will

naturaily be different from some future period in which all out warfare between our

. organization and our country's communist enemies develops.

If the team is to achieve its ultimate objectives the following activities must

be provided for: (1) organization of and within the team, (2) communications between

the team and higher command, (3) maintaining secrecy of team members, (4) main-

-taining a continucus and effective propaganda effort, (5) obtaining the necessary sup-

plies and equipment for present and future needs, (6) training of the team in general,

and of individual members in their own specialties.

When the required personnel are not available to form a full team, a three

-_mas section should be formed. When additional people are recruited the unit can

then be expanded in an orderly fashion.

BOOBY TRAPS

Broadly defined a booby trap can be any kind of apparatus

In which a reaction unfavorable to the enemy is brought about

when he unintentionally makes some act which triggers the re

action. The most common types of booby traps used in warfare

Involve an explosive charge which is set off by movement of &

trip wire or the moving of some object which is connected to

the trigger mechanism.

On occasion the explosive charge may be replaced by

signal flares, gas, smoke or other chemical agents. The trigger

mechanism may be either electric, mechanical, thermal or chemical.

ELECTRICALLY OPERATED TRIGGERS. Such trigger mechanisms

'are very easily arranged wherever a supply of electric blasting

caps are available and also a suitable source of electricity.

One of the most common electric type booby traps is to simply

Interrupt the electrical circuit in some building so that when

the lights are turned on the explosive is detonated. This

simple procedure applied to an automobile with a few sticks of

dynamite has marked the end of more than one gangland hoodlum.

Io booby, trap a car in this manner one side of the electric

blasting cap can be sttached to any metal part of the car while

Che other side is attached to a spark plug or the "cold side"

of the Igration switch. In the first case the cap detonates the

dynamite when the starter motor is turned over or if attached to

the key switch datonating occurs when the ignition is turned on.

Any movable object can be booby trapped so that when it

Le moved some simple type electrical switch, contact is closed

to complete a circuit between a day cell battery and the de

tonator. A very simple example would be to have one wire tacked

along the edge of a door and the other wire tacked to the frame

and extending out far enough that contast Is made between tha

This may be placed in a door which is then closed to open

the switch while the explosive is wired into the circuit. When

the door is opened pressure is released

and the charge explodes.

This simple trigger can be placed under the leg of a chair,

& wooden box or any other movable object of sufficient weight.

If the chair is moved or the box lifted the release of pressure

will close the electrical circuit.

A person skilled in the placement of booby traps will not

leave any part of the switch, wires or charge visible. Instead of

connecting the wires to the door. Itself he will take off the door

frame, place the trigger mechanism at the edge of the door and

then replace the frame so that the entire mechanism is hidden when

the door is closed.

By taking off the frame of a window and drilling a hole

out through the window casing the trigger mechanism can' be placed

so that the charge will be detonated by either raising or lowering

& half open window.

A simple time delay mechanism can be arranged by placing

one of these triggers under a glass jar filled with water.

When

enough of the water evaporates, the weight of the jar will no

longer be sufficient to hold the contacts open.

Figure No. 2 shows another simple electrical trigger made

from a spring clothes pin. The improvised contacts are held

apart by a small wooden wedge in the jaws of the clothes pin.

This wedge can be attached to a trip wire or other movable object.

When it is withdrawn the clothes pin shuts and the electric cir-

•cuit is completed.

mechanism

A trigger of this type can be used to make a time delay

in many different ways.

The wedge may be connected by

a loose cord to the end of a spring which is also attached to a.

tin can.

Above this a second tin can fuli of sand or water is

placed with a hole in the bottom so that the contents gradually

fall through into the second can. When the weight of the lower

can

becomes enough to stretch the spring sufficiently the wedge

will be pulled from the clothes pin. As an alternate method the

spring may be already stretched

out and held there by a second

cord attached to some other solid object. The cord holding the

spring could be placed through a candle so that it will be burned

in two when the candle burned down a certain distance. An active

Imagination can devise countless ways for activating this type

of trigger either by instant action or delayed action.

A clever derivative of this simple trigger is used in the

"British book trap"

• In this case a book is hollowed out to

contain a small battery and a quarter pound block of TNT which

is detonated by an electrical blasting cap. The circuit passes

through two contacts attached to opposite pages of the book but

are held apart by some insulating material which is attached to

the back of the bookcase.

If the book is withdrawn from the case

the contacts come together and the TNT is detonated.

A British ball bearing contact switch is shown in Figure No.

3. This type of contact is very useful in placing charges entirely

within a movable object. For example, a suitcase could be laid

on its side with the contact positioned inside in such a way that

when

the suitcase was picked up the ball bearing would roll forward

and complete the contact. Similar electrically activated booby

right side up befuse opening.

A plastic or glass test tube

• could be used instead of a metal case by sticking two wires chrough

the cork in such a manner that the ball bearing would come in

contact with both of them.

A surprisingly accurate timing device can be made with a

tube of this type. Holding the tube with the open end up, first

pour in a quantity of dried peas, then a measured amount of

water, drop in the ball bearing (in this case a wad of tin foil

could be used as weil); finally put the cork in the top with the

wire sticking down through.

The water will cause the dried peas

to swell which will push the ball bearing (or wad of tin foil)

up until it makes contact with the two wires to complete the

circuit.

The time can be regulated from a few minutes to several

hours depending on the length of the tube, the amount of water, and

the quantity of peas used.

Far more sophisticated types of electrical triggers are manu-

factured some of which operate by photoelectric cell or even more

difficult to recognize mechanisms. These may be used to safeguard

record centers, important military or missile bases, etc. but are

MECHANICAL TRIGGERS. These may be operated either by impact

or by friction. The ordinary hand grenade employs an impact

trigger.

When the handle is released a spring operated lever

snaps

against a cap (similar to the priming cap in a shotgun shell)

which in turn starts a short fuse to burn.

This fuse leads to a

blasting cap centered in an explosive charge.

The trigger mechanism of

a "potato masher" hand grenade

operates much like the firing pin of a bolt action rifle. In

this case a spring activated plunger strikes a detonator. • The

plunger may be released by pulling out a pin as shown in Figure

No. 4, by cutting a wire as shown in Figure No. 5 or by applying.

pressure

to a slotted key as shown in Figure No. 6.

Explosion of the primer cap alone is not sufficient to de-

tonate most military explosives. Generally a booster chaige of a

fairly sensitive explosive is detonated by the primer and this in

turn detonates the main charge. In military use TNT is by far the

most common explosive used in the main charge of booby traps.

INT, nitrocellulose and dimethylformamide. RDX is cyclotrinethy-

lenetrinitramine which is manufactured by nitrating hexamethylene

tetramine (which is obtained by the rcaction of formaldehyde and

ammonia).

Booster charges where necessary are usually tetryl or PETN.

or the now largely discontinued mercury fulminate.

Characteris-

•tics, uses and manufacture of explosives will be dealt with in

another chapter.

A very simple device can be made from a screen door spring

that will explode an ordinary rifle cartridge when activated by a

trip

wire. Although the "explosion" is almost harmless it can be

very

nerve racking to an approaching enemy.

A more deadly booby trap consists of a short piece of pipe

which is driven into the ground. A plunger type trigger mechanism

is dropped into the pipe and an ordinary rifle cartridge placed

point up in the pipe so that perhaps one-half inch is exposed

above the ground. The weight of a man stepping on the bullet

releases the trigger and fires the cartridge which will penetrate

well up into the leg or the body.

Some mechanical triggers are activated by friction just

like striking a natch on the rough material of the match cover.

Figure No. I shows a cut-away drawing of the U.S. Army firing

device, pull friction type M-2. The coated wire is covered with

& gritty substance much like the strip on a book of matches.

When this is pulled out through a container of flash compound

(chemically similar to the match heads) the friction ignites the

flash compound which may be used either to light a fuse or. fire

& blasting cap.

A crude but effective friction device can be prepared by

sticking the end of a fuse in some small cylinder filled with

match heads through which is placed a small strip of tin or heavy

cardboard with a friction strip from match books glued to both

sides.

In field use the friction type ignitor can be hidden in

many ways connected with trip wires or attached to movable objects

to set off either instant or delayed charges.

• THERMAL IGNITORS.

In some cases the ignitor, (fuse or primer)

can be used as a trigger mechanism.

For example in World War II

the Germans were known to tear down fireplaces and cement them

back together with hidden charges that would ignite when a fire

was built.

A

simple hand grenade or mortar shell hidden in a

hollow log by

a burned out fire would, of course, explode if the

log were used as fuel without being inspected.

A common trick is for a retreating army to leave behind coal

oil lamps or lanterns filled with gasoline. An unthinking person

who touches a match to such a lantern will nearly always be burned

to death.

CHEMICAL TRIGGERS. These are more frequently used in the

construction of time bombs than in booby traps. Figure No. 8

contains acetone.

When the piercing pin is pushed downward it

penetrates the lead disc and allows the acetone to flow into the

lower chamber.

The acetone gradually dissolves the celluloid

washer which holds back the striker.

The time delay can be varied

by placing different numbers of cellophane washers on the striker

rod.

In several similar types of delayed mechanisms the striker

suitable combination is sulfuric acid for the liquid and a mixture

of potassium chlorate and sugar for the solid. Another suitable

combination is plain water for the liquid and metallic sodium for

the solid. There are many other combinations which a chemist might

improvise from materials at hand.

There are some explosives so sensitive that they can be used

as trigger mechanisms.

Ammonium tri-iodide can be made from

ordinary household ammonia and lodine crystals. If the {odine

crystals are not

available they can be obtained by evaporating

sufficient volume of tincture of iodine in a flat glass dish.

small amount of ammonia may be added from time to time making

certain that it does not have the chance to dry out. After three

or four tablespoons of ammonia solution have been absorbed and

partly evaporated from the lodine it can be left to dry out. While

wet ammonium tri-iodide is reasonably safe to handle. When dry,

It is so sensitive that it detonates at the slightest touch. It

may 'be exploded by a person walking on a wooden floor several feet

away of a door being closed in the same building. The amount

described above will produce a violent explosion and should be

treated with extreme caution.

Several

similar compounds will be

READY MADE BOOBY TRAPS

All national armics are supplied with a variety of

manufactured trigger devices, charges, etc. to be used

specifically as booby trap material.

Most firing devices

are threaded on one end with a standing size that allows them to

be used either with prepared charges or with improvised charges

made from mortar or artillery shells. Figure No. 9 shows a

simple firing device attached to a hand grenade.

An antipersonnel mine of French manufacture is shown in

•Figure No. 10. The apparatus at the left side is a trigger

mechanism that can be operated by a trip wiré.

When it is fired

the flash

passes through the

"U" tube which propels a 60mm

grenade into the air and at the same time ignites a 1/5 second

delay pellet. The grenade explodes a few feet off the ground

to shower metal fragments over a wide area. Total weight of

mine is 5-1/2 pounds.

Guerrilla bands have sometimes used artillery shells or

mortar shells in demolition work by placing them in a large

pile of wood or other combustible material and building a bond

fire around then until they exploded.

For booby traps use, howèver,

the projectile of an

artillery shell is the only part of any

value. Useful sizes include 75mm, 90mm, 105mm, and 155mm.

those artillery shells where the priectile is attached to the case,

it is generally best to remove the projectile and discard the case.

•Artillery shell projectiles may be fused either in the nose or

in the base.

For most efficient use, the regular fuse must be

unscrewed and a standard firing device (Ml0 Universal destructor)

strong enough to hold the spring in the cocked position.

Another trick is to cover a hand grenade with wet mud with

just the safety pin ring sticking out.

After the mud has hardened,

it will hold the handle in place and the safety pin ring can be

withdrawn.

These harmless looking clumps of mud scattered along

a dirt road will, of course, break open when hit by an automobile

handle and fire the grenade. A similar

trick is to place grenades in glass jars tight enough to hold the

handle in place when the safety pins are withdrawn. At night these

may be strung on a wire across a road and may not be seen by a

car traveling at night with its lights off.

When the bottles

break the grenade handles are released and they soon explode.

"It seems doubtful that man's ingenuity vill ever be

exhausted when it comes to improvising traps of various types.

A rusty nail stuck to a board left where it will be stepped

on by a running enemy may be just as deadly to that one indivi

dual as an atomic bomb.

Open pits (sometimes with sharp stakes

aï the bottom, covered with flimsy camouflage is much older than

the bow and arrow, but were still used by the Japanese in World

War II.

-"Dead falls" made from heavy tree limbs that fall when a

victim releases them by tripping over a jungle vine can still

be useful in guerrilla warfare.

Leaving behind poisoned food or bottled drinks is common.

Alcoholic drinks are easily diluted with wood alcohol (temporary

type antifreeze) equal to 1/4 their content of ethyl alcohol

without detection. A total intake of 2 or 3 ounces will cause

blindness or death in a few hours. Soft drinks can be easily

poisoned with ethylene glycol (permanent type antifreeze) at

the rate of 2 ounces per bottle.

This dose is usually fatal

and once symptoms develop there is no known antidote.

When five parts of potassium permanganate is mixed with

one part of powdered sugar it forms a combination that will

either explode (if confined) or burn with a flash if ignited in

the open.

A new idea might be to put three or four tablespoonsful

of this material in an ash tray covered with a thin dust of cig-.

aretie ashes. The first person to put his cigarette out in that

particular ash tray would be burned bad enough to be out of

commission for quite some time. Black powder, if available, would

actually explode if used in this way.

USE OF BOOBY TRAPS

It is obvious that the use of hooby traps favors an army in

retreat, and one of their greatest uses is to slow down pursuit.

For most efficient use the laying of booby traps nust be done in

planned and cooidinated method. When time permits the entire

area to be booby trapped should be reconnoitered and the placement

of available material planned in

such

a way as to confuse the enemy,

impede his progress and cause maximum number of casualties.

'Generally speaking a large number of small booby traps are

preferred lo a few large ones.

Two of more triggers may be

autached to a single charge.

Variety of types and settings is

essential to effective use of booby traps in iaige numbers.

In the event that friendly troops of your own personnel

may re-enter such an area later ou, it is desirable that a written

record and detailed maps be kept as to where boody traps are

placed. When U.S. Army troops discover a place that is booby

trapped they mark it with a sign which consists of a red triangle

nd the word

When anti-vehiclo mines are placed by regular army forces

It is common practice to booby trip the mines so they will ex-

plode wher being renoved by personnel attempting to cléar the

area.

The use of booby traps is very adaptable to boch guerrilla

and counter-guerrilla activity. Guerrilla warfare involves two

• basic types of action: ambushes and raids. When the guerrillas

ambush regular army forces, they are the ones that will make use

of the booby traps. In raiding an enemy garrison or supply depot

they must beware of booby traps that the regular forces have

placed to protect their fixed positions.

The ambush may start when the leading vehicle of an enemy

• column strikes a mine or drives on to a bridge which is dynamited.

Perhaps time delay booby traps activated by the first vehicle in

-the column may be used to destroy other vehicles several positions

behind. Troops riding in a truck convoy may be expected to seek

cover in ditches beside the road or other points of natural pro-

tection. If these ditches have been booby trapped beforehand, they

will be killed in the very process of seeking shelter.

Before making any raid on a fixed enemy position, guerrilla

forces should carefully consider

the potential danger of booby

traps. When regular army forces

are being harrassed by guerrillas

they may be expected to leave supplies badly needed by the guerrillas

in slightly protected warehouses as traps.

These supplies may be

heavily booby trapped and counter guerrilla forces may be waiting

a short distance away to take pursuit.

To guard against these

things, the guerrilla should attempt to keep their target under

surveillance for several hours or days before making the raid.

They should observe the coming and going of enemy personnel.

the enemy is very careful to always come and go by the same route

It may mean that other routes are booby trapped. If the supplies

are not added to oi

taken from regularly, this may indicate that

they are being used

to bait a trap. By scouting the general area

guerrilla forces should guard against surprise by other enemy

forces waiting within danger distance.

After making either a raid or an ambush; guerrilla forces

should place booby traps behind them to slow up pursuit. Real

booby traps can be interspersed with imitation traps. To be

safe the enemy will have to go around or de-activate the imitations

and take just as much time doing so as if they were real. If the

enemy beccmes

carelcss in handling your imitation traps, he will

run the danger of getting killed by a live onc. In planning the

path of their retreat guerrilla forces should booby trap alternate

routes which enemy forces might use to cut them off.

MARCH 1972

"He who accepts evil without protesting it is really cooperating with it."

— Thoreau

organizing your underground group

The most effective underground movements are built step-by-step. They begin with

-intelligence networks and the dissemination of propaganda. Gradually the movement

includes passive, then active sabotage. Finally it develops into full time underground

warfare. There may be times when surprise attack or special circumstances may

roquire immediate armed resistance but such resistance cannot be fully effective un-

til the intelligence and propaganda services can be developed to an equal extent. If

proper sources of information are developed prior to military action many possible

traps and expensive mistakes can be avoided.

Once a country is at war or occupied by an enemy, recruiting new underground men -

bers is a very hazardous occupation. Suspicion and fear lie like a blanket over the

people. Neighbors are afraid to be seen talking together. Even friends become

guarded in their talk.

These are the reasons why we advocate forming your group now - while you can still

do so in comparative safety. It is like insurance purchased in hopes that you will never

collect. Il the need for active combat never comes this will still not be time wasted.

You will surely gain true friends. You will surely profit by a better understanding of

your neighbor's point of view. You will certainly add to your appreciation of the

courage and dignity of your fellow Americans.

It is best if your group can be made up of people who have known each other previously

and who already respect one another's ability and loyality. Unfortunately this is not

always possible. So long as personal existence is possible most people will try to

"exist" under the yoke of slavery. Only here and there will you find a person with the

courage and conviction to join in active resistance against the enemy.

The communists are well aware of these facts. They are constantly trying to ferment

distrust among the peoples of the free world. Even here in the United States many in-

telligent and responsible people are losing their confidence in one another, in their

53

_NN 13009B0010:32353524 Page 1120

## Page 1129

law enforcement agencies and in their government itself. This is not said with the

• intention of being hypercritical. It is merely a statement of fact.

During the past thirty years our nations "foreign policy" has repeatedly played right into

the communist's hands. As a result one free nation after another has been handed to the

reds on a silver platter. Time and time again these "mistakes" have been concealed

from the people or have been white-washed by persons in high government office. How

can anyone blame the American public for beginning to wonder?

All too often people who have tried to call attention to these facts have themselves been

smeared as "fascists", "extremists", and worse. The following is quoted from the

American Legion Magazine, November 1961:

"Although Americans generally have no use for communism, many

protest vigorously whenever an attempt is made to expose or dis-

credit communists.... No sooner is an anti-communist organization

launched than it is attacked, hissed at and spat upon. The same is

true of INDIVIDUALS from the moment they assail the twin evils of

communism and communists.

Why do so many Americans join the never ending campaign to dis-

credit and destroy those who are fighting their battles against comm-

unism for them and in the process, risking their reputations, their

livelihood, their health, and even their LIVES. How is the phenomenon

of perversity to be explained?!!

How indeed? Yet this situation does exist and added to the suspicion that has developed

among our countrymen, it makes people reluctant - even afraid - to exercise their rights

of free speech and peaceable assembly.

During the past few years thousands of "study groups" and similar anti-communist

organizations have come into existence. As those who belong to them know, many

people are "too busy" even to inform themselves as to the true nature of the communist-

socialist menace. With this in mind you might imagine it would be very difficult to get

people to spend their own money for arms and then get them out in the open where

they can train in the use of such arms.

Strangely enough, we have found it much easier than you might think. It may be that

people have developed a sense of futility about writing their congressmen or working

for political candidates (presidents come and presidents go but the old bureaucracy

just keeps rolling along).

Since World War Il billions of words have been spoken by the negotiators and the prop-

agandizers in the "cold war". Still the free world is losing steadily. The people have

lost faith in words. Few beliove in the power of words anymore.

If you approach them in such a way as to prove that you are yourself sincere, you will

## Page 1130

find among your' own acq

aces many who are tired of talk a. who will be glad to find

some constructive action which they can enter into.

AS YOU FORM YOUR OWN GROUP KEEP THESE FACTS IN MIND:

(1). The underground needs all kinds of people, young and old, men and women. Those

who the enemy "would never suspect"' can act as spies and messengers. The underground

needs many different things in addition to fighters : sources of supply, lines of commun-

ications, a multitude of skills that can be supplied by many different kinds of people.

(2.) To voluntarily start training in the use of arms, especially in the absence of a de-

clared state of war, requires a deep personal conviction that this must be done now for

the salvation of ourselves and our country. If you do not believe this yourself you will

• never be able to pass the necessary conviction to other members of your group.

(3) A small group that is resolute and dedicated will be more effective than a large

group containing people that my doubt the importance of their cause.

For a batallion of men to attack the enemy in the face of gunfire requires courage. For

one or two men to fight alone in the dark requires bravery. For the wives of such men

to spend the night waiting and wondering requires even greater bravery. These are the

type of people you MUST collect about you.

It is natural for living things to want to keep on living. The kind of bravery we are talk-

ing about is not something people are born with. It is something that a person must de-

velop within himself. It comes only from the absolute belief that our cause for freedom

is more important that anything else in this world.

Where can you find such people? You find them among your neighbors, among the people

you work with, among your friends and your relatives. You might never guess it as you

move among these people in their daily lives but there are countless numbers of Amer-

icans who share this belief with you.

- This does not mean that such people are going to be immediately enthusiastic about

forming an underground. Some may, but others may never have had an opportunity to

learn the true facts about our national arid international situation. That's where you

come in. You must be able lo convince such people that they cannot afford to wait until

the last minute before the get prepared.

To convince others you must first be sure of your own facts. The organization has sev-

eral picces of literature available which exposes the communist threat inside America

as well as books on guerrilla wariare.

Remember, the formation of a group should first start with intelligence and propaganda.

Don't mistakc what we mean by "propaganda". Some people have the idea that this ie-

55

NW 55009 DocId 32989524

Page 1130

---

## Page 1131

fers only to informati

is false and misleading: Prop.

refers only to the use.

of information to attract people to your way of thinking. Truth is the best possible kind of

propaganda.

Here then are the step-by-step suggestions on how to go about forming your own group:

1. Know the truth. Be able to back up your view of the current situation with facts

and references.

2. Make a list of everyone you know even casually: friends, fellow workers, neigh-

bors, lodge or church members and relatives.

3. Renew old acquaintances. Get to really know these 'people. Feel them out on

current events, politics, and world affairs. Let them know where you stand.

4. Do not choose people just because you think they would be willing to join your

group. Choose instead those that you want in your group. Remember that if fight-

ing actually starts these people will be closely associated with you and themselves

for long periods of time. Eliminate the braggarts. Pick the quiet confident people

that won't get on each others nerves when the going gets tough.

5. After you have decided on a list of five to twelve people you are ready to give

them your "sales talk". You can do this with each one individually or you can get

them together as a group for this purpose. If you talk to them singly you can main-

tain a greater degree of secrecy about other members of the group.

Group discussion has the advantages that each prospect is more likely to take your

viewpoint seriously if he is sitting down among other people who seem to be taking

it seriously also. Since you wan't be taking up anything too secret during your

first two or three meetings, there will be plenty of time to eliminate any doubtfuls,

or more likely, they will eliminate themselves.

6. Whether you tall to your prospective group members singly or as a group, your

first discussion should convince them of these things:

a. That the free world is losing the cold war against communism.

b. That as things are now going we will keep right on losing and that sooner or

later Americans may be forced to defend their own property and their own

• families by whatever means are still available to them.

c. That your small group may not be able to do anything to change this situation

but in any event you should get together regularly for at least a few meetings

to examine any possibilities that may exist.

d. Be willing to admit that things may not actually be as bad as you believe but

get your prospective group members to at least admit that they owe it to them-

selves to discover the facts.

.560

NW 55009 DocId: 32989524

Page 1131

## Page 1132

Get your prospicts to do some reading. Loan them buoks and pamphlets. Use

anti-communist and U.S. Government literature to back up your own arguments.

f. By all means set up a definite place and schedule for future meetings.

7. If you decide to begin the organization of your group by having them all meet

together for your "sales talk", here are some additional points that have proven

effective many times in the past for other members.

a. Hold the meeting in your own home if possible. Otherwise, reserve a room

in one of the downtown hotels or motels well ahead of time.

•b. Give your prospects an invitation at least two weeks ahead of time and ask them

to confirm at least a week before the meeting that they will be there.

c. Do noi tell them exactly what the meeting is about except that it is a matter of

"mutual importance"'. They should be told that if they come it must be with the

understanding that they will arrive on time and will not leave before the meeting

is over.

d. Where a married person is invited the invitation may include both husband and

and wife and they should both be urged to attend if at all possible. If one is absent

he or she will not understand the importance of the project and may object to the

time or money which the other will spend on future activities.

8.- When. you get your group together, start the meeting off promptly and in a busi-

ness like manner.

It is certain that there will be a lot of questions about your plans and objectives. If you

are organizaing as an affiliate of the organization, they will want to know more about

the parent organization; ho and why it was formed, and they will need to be convinced

that they are not going to be considered radicals for entering into this preparation.

Here is where your own knowledge and skill is all important. You must assure them

there is nothing illegal about this activity. We are urging them to act only as individuals

under their own constitutional right of fee speech, peaceable assembly and the right to

own and bear arms.

If you feel that your group is not completely sold on your presentation, it may be best to

postpone much discussion of the organization until a second meeting.

After your first small group is formed further members should be recruited on a selec-

tive basis. In this way you may include the many different skills needed without the size

of the group getting too large. By each member having a special task to do their interest

and enthusiasm will be maintained at & high level.

Remember that an underground needs many things in addition to fighters. Your fighters

alone without proper spy-networks, supply lines, and community support would soon be

surrounded, starved out, or betrayed. In addition to your fighting group members who

NW 55009 DocId: 32989524 Page 1132

57

---

## Page 1133

all know each other, you should enlist the assistance of many other people who are

sympathetic to your cause and willing to help in their own way although they should

know no more about your members or operations than necessary to gain their coopera-

tion. They will form an auxillary force to work with the individual group member who is

responsible for their special activity.

The group leader, if he is to successfully maintain his position must by one means or

another make certain that all six of these activities are provided for.

ORGANIZATION:

The organization of the group is primarily the responsibility of the group leader. He

must interview personally each new prospective member and make certain that they are

• suitable material. This means more than simply being loyal to the United States. The

prospective member must be impressed with the fact that he is undertaking a grave

responsibility. He must be made to understand that even though he has joined the group

on "faith" rather than from complete knowledge of its overall activity, that withdrawing

from the group will not be easy and that if he should in the future withdraw from the

group that he will ever after be considered as suspect by the other group members. The

prospective group member must be a type that will get along well with other people.

He must not be a braggart or a show-off. Under no circumstances must he become in-

toxicated or loose-mouthed. He must be a willing worker and ready to assume his share

of the load.

The group leader should determine the skills and interest of his members. He should

talk over with them the various tasks that need to be performed and ask for volunteers

until each member has a responsibility that they are interested in and that they are

capable of fulfilling. Since membership in the organization is essentially voluntary the

group leader cannot force any member to perform any activity against his will and

should not attempt to do so. When a member assumes responsibility for a certain field

of activity he must realize that he will be expected to fulfill that task successfully re-

gardless of any other conditions that may arise. If a member is unwilling to assume

responsibility on this basis, he should be given another responsibility that better fits

his capabilities or should be gracefully eased out of the organization.

INTELLIGENCE:

Intelligence includes all types of information that may be of value at either the national

or local level. Scraps and bits of information that may. seem of little value alone may

eventually fit into a pattern that will someday provide important information for either

defensive or offensive action, either propaganda or open warfare.

The group member in charge of intelligence should enlist the assistance of several

non-combatants to help gather this information. One or two of these should read all

the local and regional papers carefully every day. It's surprising how much information

can be picked up from these sources concerning individuals that may be active in commu-

nist front activity. If one or more members of the group are union members, they should

provide the union papers for examination.

Other auxillary member

S

dd take part in church and PTA

vities to guard against

communist infiltration in these areas.

A reading and study group should be set up to

study school textbooks and teaching methods in your area for collectivist-socialist-

communist slanting.

An auxillary member should carefully evaluate all of the "Letters to the Editor" that

appear in various papers in the area.. Those who express especially patriotic senti-

ments and those who are outspoken in their defense of the American constitution and

way of life should be truned over to the recruiting officer who can contact them as poten-

tial members or auxillary members. Those who advocate collectivism in any form should

be turned over to the security officer who can look up their full names, addresses, etc.,

and file them away among the potential turncoats.

The intelligence officer should evaluate all the information sent to him by his auxillary

members to determine the sentiments of people in his area especially those in politics

or in a position to influence other people. He should pass on to the regional headquarters

any information that involves national or international figures or organizations where in

turn it will be compiled with other information and sent on to the national headquarters.

SECURITY:

The security officer mustbe responsible for secrecy within the group and about the

group. We have learned that those members whose membership or identity becomes

known will in all probability be subject to abuse and harrassment from the liberals

and communists. Therefore, one major duty of the security officer is to prevent the

identity of the group's actual members from becoming known.

He should also review from time to time the methods of communications between members

of the group. He should insure the secrecy of the meeting places and the training sites.

He should arrange for at least two or more secret addresses for receipt and delivery of

mail between groups and particularly the regional coordinator. He should be careful

that the amount of mail, frequency of meetings, number of parked cars and similar cir-

cumstances do not draw attention to the group or its activities.

One of the security officers most important projects is to arrange for a number of "safe

houses". These are people bothin city and rural areas who have no contact with group

members at all and who are quite ordinary in their daily life and yet have a strong sym-

pathy for the organization. They must be willing to care for wounded members or pro-

vide hiding places for group members that have been discovered by the enemy. If the

communists take over this country from within it is quite possible that the underground

and its members will be declared outlawed and it is also possible that individual members

may be "framed" with false charges. To hide out a fugitive under these conditions would

require a great deal of faith as well as courage. Unfortunately a great percentage of the

great American public has neither. Even so, the obtaining of such refuge houses may be

essential to the groups ultimate survival and must be arranged for at all costs. Only

the group leader, the intelligence officer and the security officer should know the loca-

tion of these "safe houses" except for the individual member who may put the group in

touch with individual locations.

• PROPAGANDA:

-Until such time as fighting might actually break out we must expect to engage in a con-

tinuous propaganda warfare against the communists, communist sympathizers and dupes

within our-borders. Our ultimate victory or defeat may depend on the outcome of the

propaganda battles that we are fighting right now.

-By planted newspaper articles and by slanted programs over radio and TV the enemy is

-even now trying to "smear" us out of existence. They are also starting an all-out cam-

paign to outlaw the use and ownership of firearms by civilians.

During the cold war period the propaganda officer should act as a public relations man

for the organization in his locality. It is important that this individual make a good per-

sonal appearance and be able to speak and write well. Without actually admitting that

he is a member of the organization, he can still contact various nèws media, television,

-etc. and ask them to find out the true facts about the organization before blindly re-

peating half truths and insinuations that come over the wire services or that they read

in-other papers and magazines..

Whenever local papers carry articles detrimental to the organization, he should have

-all members, auxillary members, their friends, relatives, and associated groups flood

that paper, radio or TV station as the case may be with both signed and unsigned letters

demanding a retraction.

• In cases where some particular news media makes a habit of slandering the organization

or when some particular news commentator or TV personality does so repeatedly, then

the organization should write repeatedly to the companies that place advertising with

them to demand a retraction.

Articles or comments which are actually libelous should be forwarded to the regional

headquarter's for investigation and the possibility of law suits against the offending per-

sons.

The propaganda officer should prepare himself to speak publicly and should arrange to

give talks to various civic organizations on the importance of the citizen's right to self

defense.

RECRUITING:

The recruiting officer should discuss with other members of the group what additional

skills are needed and with their help should attempt to enlist the assistance of people

who have such skills. He should cooperate with the security officer to determine whether

or not prospective members are loyal to their country and have ideals in keeping with

our organization. He should receive from the intelligence officer names of prospective .

members or associates and contact them to evaluate their possible usefulness to the

group. If new groups or new group members are recruited through advertising, he

should work with the propaganda officer to prepare effective material. A recruiting

officer should make a special effort to enlist the cooperation of a reputable attorney to

advise the group as to its legal rights and defend these rights in court if necessary.

With other members in the group the cooperation of a doctor should also be arranged

fOr.

Together with the security

¿cer he should attempt to find a princer locally who will

supply the group with literature on an absolutely confidential basis. All of the other

members of the group should be contacted by the recruiting officer and passed on by the

security officer after checking any information known about the prospective member with

the intellignece officer.

MEDICAL:

-This man may be a doctor or one skilled in first aid. In the latter case, he should make

contact with a physician who will work with the group to provide necessary drugs, medi-

cal supplies and confidential assistance in time of need.

This member will also be responsible for obtaining medical supplies and keeping adequate

reserves on hand. He should give consideration to the general health of all group mem-

bers and should encourage each member to maintain a maximum degree of physical

fitness for their age and circumstances. A medical officer shouli make all group mem-

bers keep on hand a large amount of special drugs or medicine each member must for

his health.

COMMUNICATIONS:

This member of the group should have or obtain a working knowledge of all radio equip-

-ment, field telephone, codes and signals. If he is not an amatuer radio operator himself,

he should work with the recruiting officer to enlist the aid of one or more amateur radio

operators either as group members or as associates. He should be responsible for pass

words and other words of identifying friendly supporters. He should arrange suitable

code phrases by which essential information can be given over the telephone between group

members without giving it away in case the phone is tapped.

ARMAMENT AND DEMOLITION:

The armament officer, with the assistance of other group members should see that

all of the groups equipment is safe to use and kept in good repair. He should have suf-

ficient knowledge of firearms and weapons to instruct other members in their use and

maintenance.

He may designate other members to become specialists-in certain types

of weapons and so forth.

At icast one group member should make him self an expert in the use of all types of

explosives, booby traps, time fuses, and similar material. In cooperation with the

armament officer and other group members he should determine both immediate and

future needs and sources of such materials along with means to obtain such items and

also the raw materials from which these items can be quickly manufactured.

SUPPLIES:

The supply officer should keep in mind that the organization has no legal status except

their rights as individuals. Group ownership of firearms or supplies could be con-

NW 55009 DocId:32989524 Page 1136

which would be a violation of the law.

dinate the stock piling or obtaining of material, it must be clearly understood by all that

each individual item is owned by some individual member. The supply officer is pri-

marily responsible for the storage of reserve materials.

Each group should prepare a number of escape and evasion kits. These should be of

three types:

1. A very small kit which each member can carry on his person.

2. A suitcase size kit that can be kept in the car or home at all times.

3. An inexpensive kit that can be buried at strategic places or hidden in other

-strategic localities.

TRAINING:

The training schedule may be arranged for by the group leader or he may elect to

assign this responsibility to a training specialist.

In eiter case an inventory should

be made of the various skills, talents, and knowledge of each member. All members

should discuss together the thrity different parts of the initial training program. They

should divide these sections up among themsleves so that some member can read and

study each subject prior to the training session and be prepared to instruct the other

members in his own speciality.

FINANCES:

Although the individual group members must be self sustaining as far as their individual

equipment is concerned, there will be many expenses that must be met collectively. To

fight the propaganda war requires printing, postage, travel, and so forth. Although the

individual group members may be able to meet this expense to a minimum degree they

will not in most cases be able to finance the maximum effort that is required. The fin-

ance officer should therefore consult with the other group members as to means of rais-

ing additional money. One possible source will be from people who will agree with the

aims of the organization in theory but who are unwilling or unable to take an active

part in the program. Such people may be willing to set up a series of regular monthly

contributions to help finance our fight against communism.

In small groups one member may have to double up on two of these duties. In larger

groups, the division of responsibility may be spread among a greater number of indi-

i viduals and still other duties may be assigned to individual members.

The important thing is to meet regularly and discuss your mutual problems. If each

member has a job he is interested in and keeps busy at, morale will stay high and you

will really get things done. Without such team work the group members will soon lose

interest and become discouraged.

There are a great many. ways in which women' can be a valuable aid to the group either

cans the part time service

of one or more secretaries who can type up literature to be printed, articles to the

newspapers, communications between groups and so on. Much of the intelligence work

-can be handled by women. They can assist the propaganda effort by handing out litera-

ture, giving talks to women's clubs, PTA associations and so forth.

It is felt that it would be a mistake to set down hard and fast rules for the group's con-

duct and activities. To do so would run the risk of making each group a carbon copy of

every other group and possibly of stifling individual ingenuity. One of the greatest ad-

vantages that an underground has is the simple fact that the enemy never knows what he

is up against.

The group leader must continually merit the respect and confidence of his members. This

respect is the only means he has of maintaining discipline. Before taking any action,

all members of the group should have an opportunity to voice their opinions. But it must

be mutually understood that when the discussion is over, the group leader must make the

final decision. His decision must be complied with and in return for the compliance, he

...--must bear responsibility for the groups ultimate failure or success.

Past experience has shown that the successful underground leader must possess certain

minimal qualifications:

1. He must have a strong personal conviction as to the righteousness of the cause

for which he is fighting.

2. He must have the ability to infuse other members of his group with this same.

conviction,

3. He must be able to exercise effective command over his group through personal

loyalty and political enthusiasm when no other means of discipline are available.

4. He must be able to keep secrets and organize even quite important actions so

that as few people as possible know his plans.

5. He should be a born conspirator, capable of deceiving not only the enemy but

even his members of his own group if this is necessary to insure absolute security.

6. He must be able to act inventively and imaginatively so as to constantly seize

the initiative away from the enemy.

7. He should have risen to his position of leadership through his own abilities and

execution.

8. He should be physically vigorous and self-denying so that he can accommodate

himself to primitive surroundings.

9. He should have no addictions or strong habits that might distract him at some

• crucial moment.

10. He must have the bulldog tenacity to see that important tasks are completed

no matter what difficulties or obstacles may be placed in his path.

11. He must have the patience to remain inactive when such is the best course and to

wait for exactly the right time to strike.

12.

He must have the moral courage to accept full responsibility for his own actions

and those of his group.

You should think these requirements over carefully. How do you measure up? It's best

if we admit our weak spots to ourselves and start now to strengthen ourselves for the

trials ahead. With advance preparation, self-discipline and a firm resolve we can meet

the test.

The human race is much inclined to wishful thinking. Even though the communist have

told us that they will never rest until they have conqured the whole world, most people will

no allow themselves to even consider this possibility. As war clouds gather on the horizon,

most people focus their attention all the more on other things and hope that if they just

ignore the threat of war it will somehow disappear.

When the time for underground warfare suddenly comes there will be a hundred civilians

wanting to fight for every one that is trained or equipped to do so. Under these conditions

each member of our organization and similar groups that are making ready for this

emergency will surely find himself acting as leader of an underground group. As a part

of your self-training it is thus necessary to give some thought as to how you can quickly

train new recruits, how you can maintain discipline and security. In short, you must give

some serious advance thought as to your own abilities and possible short-comings as an

underground leader.

Abraham Lincoln

Fellow members,

- *

The main subject that will be covered in this month's bulletin will be the forced entry

into buildings, as it applies to underground warfare. A two page article on the use of

ammonium nitrate as an explosive is also covered in this bulletin.

We have several points that need to be covered in this bulletin and not much space if

we are to keep our postage bill within reason. On the surface, the lives of the American

people seem to be going on about the same as usual. So long as most of them have enough

to eat and a few luxuries of life, they continue to ignore the undercurrent of treason with-

in our own borders which is rapidly washing away the foundations of our American Heritage.

Those who have taken the time to inform themselves as to the true conditions realize

that our country is rapidly reaching a point of no return in its downhill fight against the

forces of freedom.

The time is past when the SAO can consider any but a military answer to the problems

that face our country. We must act as quickly as we can to develop internal discipline

and definite chains of command. Il we are going to be a fighting unit, then we must be

ready to fight when the time arises.

If we loss those among our organization who are unable to face reality or unwilling to

make the sacrifice necessary to add to our strength rather than to detract from it, then

the organization as a whole will be better off for it.

New combat teams, groups, and networks will be forming within the next 90 days.

Assignment of new members to these new units will be made as soon as they have finished

their basic training programs. All leams and groups are urged to expand their local

units and keep them active on constructire local projects.

THE

OF AMMONIUM NITRATE IN HIL

1 EXPLOSIVES

• Ammonium nitrate is a common fertilizer used on farms throughout the United States

and most foreign countries. It is readily available from farm agencies, general stores,

fertilizer companies, etc. in most farming communities.

Most people know that ammonium nitrate can be used as the basis for various high

explosive mixtures.

Little information has been available as to the best proportion,

uses and means of detonating these mixtures.

Depending on the method of manufacture ammonium nitrate may occur as irregular

grains, flakes, small crystals or small round "prills". Any of these types can be used

but prilled ammonium nitrate is most efficient. Fortunately, the prilled type is also

the most common.

Explosive mixtures may be made by mixing ammonium nitrate with such organic

compounds as fuil oil, powered coal, lamp black, etc. Its quite possible that powered

sugar, starch, and many similar compounds could also be used but further experiment

ation is needed. Ammonium nitrate itself is extremely difficult to detonate.

The most common and probably the best all round mixture consists of 94% prilled

ammonium nitrate aud 6% fuel oil. In this case the term fuel oil can include No. 2

diesel fuel, kerosene, light lubricating cil, etc. The only requirements are that it be

thin enough to be readily absorbed by the rather porous prills of ammonium nitrate and

on the other hand it must not be so volatile as to evaporate easily.

The amount of fuel oil can vary from 2% to 13% and the mixture will still explode

provided that a strong detonater is used. Maximum explosive force is achieved between

5% and 6%. These percentages are figured by weight.

Presumably the best percentage

of lamp black or finely powered coal would be approximately the same.

Because these mixtures are comparatively insensitive they all require a rather

strong explosive to start the detonation.

In nearly all cases a one pound stick (2x8 inches)

of 60% dynamite will suffice. The dynamite itself must, of course be detonated by a

suitable blasting cap. One stick of 40% dynamite does not have enough power to detonate

an ammonium nitrate-fuel oil mixture reliably. If this is all that is available, three

sticks tied together should be used.

The shape as well as the size of the detonater has an effect.

• For example, if an

eight inch stick of dynamite is cut into four inch pieces and these are tied together it

effectively decreases the length and increases the diameter of the detonating charge.

This will increase its reliability over that achieved by a single eight inch stick.

'Several other fact.

erfect the efficiency of AN-FO (ar...

um nitrate-fuel oil)

mixtures.

Among these are the amount of explosive used in a single charge, degree

of confinement, moisture content, particle size temperature, etc.

AN-FO mixtures are commonly used in mining rock or ore from large open pits.

In this application, holes are drilled back into the rock and the AN-FO mixture is poured

into the holes. Normally, the ammonium nitrate and the fuel oil are carried separately

to the mine and are mixed together just before they are used. The holes into which the

AN-FO mixture is poured are usually several feet long. In this case the diameter of the

hole has considerable effect on the explosive force generated. A hole diameter less than

•three inches will not explode with sufficient force to carry itself along the bore hole. The

maximum detonation velocity requires that the bore hole be at least six inches diameter.

In using smaller amounts of AN-FO mixtures the charge should be kept approximately

equal in its length, width and depth. In practical application a container about the size

of a five gallon gas can is as small as can be used. Charges the size of a 55 gallon drum

can provide much more explosive force in proportion to their weight. A small amount of

AN-FO requires just as strong a primer to detonate as does a larger amount.

Close confinement is required to achieve maximum explosive force from AN-FO

mixtures. In mining operations the rock surrounding the charge provides this confine-

ment. To be exploded above ground the AN-FO mixture should be confined in an iron

pipe not less than three inches in diameter and preferably larger. Since these mixtures

are "pushing" type explosives rather than "shattering" types they must be properly placed

to achieve useful results,

• Suppose the objective was to destroy a large bridge. A dozen five gallon cans of

AN-FO mixture are available to do the job. If these are set in the middle of the bridge

or between the girders and "exploded" little if any real damage will result. In this case,

a tunnel should be dug through the dirt behind the concrete abutment at one end of the

bridge. Depending on the width of the bridge all twelve cans of explosive could be packed

tightly together or they could be spaced three to four feet apart. In either case each can

should be provided with its own primer and all the primers should be tied together with

two lengths of prima cord.

Moisture content of the ammonium nitrate is very important. This chemical absorbs

moisture from the air quite easily. After being mixed with the fuel oil it is protected

from this to a considerable extent. For maximum explosive effect the AN-FO mixture

should contain no more than 4% water and if the moisture content exceeds 7% it may not

explode at all. If it is suspected that the AN-FO mixture may be damp, double the size

of the detonater.

For military use, suitable charges could be made from dry ammonium nitrate mixed

with the proper amount of fuil oil and then placed in water tight containers. These con-

tainers should provide some means of quickly placing the detonater into the approximate

center of the charge just before it is to be used. The usual cost of ammonium nitrate

is about $6.00 per 100 pounds.

FORCED ENTRY OF BUILDINGS

In this bulletin we shall study this subject as applicable

to underground warfare. In our advanced training lessons we will

deal with more specific subjeots such as picking, pick guns, key

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

UNDERGROUND BULLETIN

GENERAL HEADQUARTERS

JUNE 1972

"! The people never give up their liberties but under some delusion".

Edmund Burke

Fellow members,

At a recent meeting of the SAO General Staff a very important problem was discussed

and the decision to issue a new Organizational Directive made. The problem is that of

new members who join our organization and then immediately become totally inactive.

Typically these new members submit a well qualified application form together with

.....their membership fee.

Unfortunately, after being accepted as provisional members

they never pay a month's dues or send in any report forms. It would really help us to

know why some of these people have acted in this way. Did our organization turn out

to be something different than they expected ? Did they expect a fancy uniform and rifle

to be handed to them on a silver platter? Or did they suddenly become afraid to stick

their neck out ?

Whatever the reasons, it isn't fair to our good members to waste time and money on

those who do nothing to help or support the organization. Therefore, effective immed-

iately,, the following rules shall apply to such cases as mentioned above.

1. If, three months after submitting an application to the SAO and being accepted as

a provisional member, the new member has not begun the basic correspondence training,

submitted monthly report forms, paid monthly dues, or provided a reasonable excuse

for not having done the above, their file shall be turned over to our Intelligence Section

for special attention.

2. If, after six months, the member in question dosen't respond they shall be dropped

from our rolls and their names shall be circulated to all members as a potential security

risk.

We don't mean to imply that a member can't resign from the Secret Army Organization.

However, we do require that a member notify us of there intent and reasons for doing so.

If this new Organizational Directive applies to any member in particular let him take notice

and govern himself accordingly.

HOW

PR

*ARE GUNS FOR STORAGE "

BT YING

Although cosmoline can be purchased in many surplus stores, it may be more

practical to make your own from the following directions. One advantage to making

your own preparation is that it is much easier to apply while it is in a warm state.

Heat non-bleached petroleum jelly ( ember-vaseline) in a small pan or can. Add

30 or 40 weight motor oil to obtain the proper consistency.

Using an inexpensive

throw-away paint brush as an applicator, brush the warm solution over the weapon.

While the solution is still warm it can also be poured into those hard-to-get-at-areas.

One large jar of petroleum jelly and approximately one-half quart of motor oil

is sufficient to prepare several weapons.

When the solution has cooled it will set and form a protective coating over the

weapon which should then be wrapped in sheet plastic ( available in most hardware or

paint stores) or in a G. I. plastic gun case (available in most surplus stores ). Wrap

well and seal with black electrical or plastic tape. It is also wise to enclose a small

sack of silicagel crystals to keep the moisture out. These crystals can be purchased

at any industrial chemical house or most applicance stores will give them away as they

come with cartons of appliances when shipped and they usually have an abundance on

supply.

Long guns which cannot be easily torn down can be stored in surplus rocket type

boxes readily available in most surplus stores.

Try to obtain aluminum or stainless

steel containers since they will not tend to rust when buried. 20mm ammunition cans

are adequate and a convenient size container for burying smaller weapons and other

items. They should be well sealed. The cans should be wrapped in plastic to prevent

rust.

Buried containers should have at least one and a half feet of earth over them. One

should be careful also in selecting an area to bury material. Areas that could be flooded

during even the most unusual weather conditions should be avoided.

Buried containers should be in such a position that they can be found easily and

quickly without the use of maps. This can be done by correlation between two or more

specific points that will remain in tact, such as trees, large rocks, etc. To assist

your memory, paces should be marked off by using the day, month, and year of your

birth or that of some family member which you can easily remember.

Another suggestion would be for burying containers along or near roadways which

are marked with numbered signs indicating the footage of road per county. These signs

are permanent, but it must be remembered that the state has a 500 foot right away on

most roads which means the brush may be cleared or the existing road might be widened.

All material which is buried should be checked within three to six weeks for settling

or sinking of the ground.

¿ACTICAL SECURITY MEASURES

: 1. Use deceptive measures. Subscribeto one or more left-wing periodicals

or get on the mailing list of some "peace movement": This will keep the postal in-

specotrs guessing as to which side you are really on. While doing this our members

can be of great assistance in searching this left-wing literature for names and ad-

dresses of fellow travelers and forwarding this information for our Central Intelli-

gence files. We desperately need people to assist in this work. Please inquire as

to detailed instructions for such activity.

2. Always use two envelopes in sending mail to any patriotic organizations or

to any other member of our own organization. Do not put a return address on the

outer envelope. Put your return address on the inside envelope with the words,

"return postage guaranteed".

• 3.: Place some opaque material such as tin foil, carbon paper, etc. between

the inner and outer envelopes to prevent your mail from being read by infra-red

cameras.

4.

Be careful in the use of the telephone. Avoid telephone calls to known

members of the organization as much as possible.

•6. Prepare telephone codes ahead of time for future protection.

7. In recruiting new members always learn as much as you can about the

prospective recruit and make sure he is not an infiltrator before you identify your-

self as a member of the organization.

8. Members of the organization in each area should be divided into four

groups:

A. Those who have been identified publicly or by law enforcement agencies

as members of the Secret Army Organization.

B. Those persons not known as members of this organization but who are

generally known as being patriots.

C. Those persons who have kept their political beliefs hidden.

D. Members who profess to be liberal for the purpose of infiltrating enemy

organizations.

All members should be very careful in making contact with persons in a

different category than themselves.

For example, people in Class D should be

very secret in their contacts and communications with persons of Class A or Class

n to other members

9. Avoid loose talk. Do not discuss organizational plans in public places

where you could be overheard. Do not even hint at such a discussion in the pre-

sence of non-members.

10. Do not write patriotic letters to newspapers or magazines under your

own name. To do so achieves very little except to identify you to the enemy.

• .

11. If you are already known as a patriot, or as a member of this organiza-

tion you may find it advisable to spread the rumor that you have become disillusioned

with the right-wing or for you to pretend a gradual loss of interest.

12. Classify your various members addresses, you communications and

your other activities as "top secret", "secret" or "restricted". Use your most

secret lines of communication only for the most important messages rather than

flooding them with unimportant material.

13. Demand obedience to all security measures from all members. Per-

sistent disregard for security measures should be cause for disciplinary action.

14. Check your lines of communication from time to time by sending phoney

messages to make certain they are not intercepted.

15. Change mail drops, meeting places, etc. frequently.

16. Prepare secret rendevous points, mail drops, etc. now that may be

used in time of some future emergency.

17. Each unit should assign some member the rank of Security Officer and

should set up a system of fines or other penalties for failure to comply with secur-

ity precautions.

18. Observe the "need to know" rule. Each member should be given only

that information which is needed by him in the performance of his duty or which

he will need in cooperating with other members of the unit. No member should

feel "left out" because he is denied such information. Instead every member

should willingly avoid information which he does not need.

19. Be careful that you are not followed in going to and from meeting places

or in making contact with other members of the organization.

20. Keep all records and correspondence carefully hidden and in a manner

that they can be casily destroyed. Records should be kept in code whenever possi-

ble.

THE COMBAT TEAM

General Outline

The "Combat Team" is the smallest organizational unit used by the Secret

Army Organization. When organized in the proper manner it is capable of opera-

tional initiative when detached from the parent organization. When developed to

its highest degree of efficiency the Combat Team is almost totally self-sufficient

and able to perlorm any one of several missions. To attain these aims the follow-

ing elements are essential:

a.

Equipment should be well-chosen and standardized as much as pos-

sible.

b.

c.

d.

Communications, internal and external, must be capable of rapid

transmission, be varied in nature, and be exercised with prime

emphasis on security.

Internal coordination should be automatic in response. Confidence

among members of the team must be developed.

Selection of each position on the team should be based on psycholog-

ical aspects as well as technical competence.

e.

f.

g.

h.

i.

NW 55009

DocId: 32989524

Training of the men in each function should be at regular intervals

and continuous.

Field problems should be given dry runs in detail:

The logistics problem should be studied with care, and made simple

and direct.

Each team will have a "leader" (Lieutenant) and an "assistant leader"

(Sergeant). These men shall be given special training by the Secret

Army Organization at "leadership seminars".

Team "marshalling points" should be selected in advance and be

well defined. Practice "alerts" will determine the team's efficiency

in response and security.

Terrain familiarity within the expected operational radius of the

team must be developed.

Weapons familiarity must be obtained throughlive firings at various

targets. Team action must be stressed as well as individual com-

petence.

The team leader should see that a constant flow of information is

provided to team members on the ideological struggle. This will

help induce the proper frame of mind in each member.

Team missions and targets must be identified and the proper train-

ing equipment made available for each assignment.

IM.

" The te

leaders will be responsible for antaining the overall

security of the unit. Personal feelings should not affect decisions

involving reprimand or dismissal of men from the team for reasons

that endanger its operation or security.

Intelligence gathering as an important part of each team member's

duties should be stressed. Information on the location and move-

ments of local communist and left-wing enemies of the organization

should be sent to either Regional or General Headquarters.

The team leaders will be responsible for maintaining contact with

higher command and for the transmission of orders from same.

ORGANIZATION

The "Combat Team" will consist of six men. These six men will be divid-

ed into two sub-teams (Sections). Number One Section wiil consist of the Team

Lieutenant and two other team members. Number Two Section will consist of the

Team Sergeant and the two remaining team members. When completely assembled

the unit will act directly under the command of the Team Lieutenant. When split

into sections the Team Sergeant will carry out the orders of the Team Lieutenant

during missions but will be in immediate command of the Number Two Section.

In the absence of the Team Lieutenant the Sergeant will take command of the Unit.

TRANSPORTATION

Transportation of the Combat Team will be effected by the use of two car-

riers. Interception and/or destruction of one carrier will not, then, immobilize

the team. In addition, each carrier can serve as a scouting element for the other.

Motorized carriers should be as inconspicuous as possible and still serve their

purpose. Jeeps and pickup trucks should be used only where such vehicles are

owned and used commonly by the general population or where the terrain makes

their use necessary. Most often an ordinary passenger car will suffice. The

model selected should have a good road clearance so it can be used on dirt roads.

Tire chains (if needed), hydraulic jacks, extra gas, water, and suitable tools

should be stored in the vehicle.

TRAVEL PROCEDURES

Underway, Carrier #1 will lead and Carrier #2 will trail, The "interval"

will vary with conditions. In cities close-aboard trailing willbe used. Open road,

by day, will require an interval of approximately 300 yards. At night this will

be reduced to approximately 100 yards. During travel, all equipment (especiaily

arms and ammunition) should be kept out of sight. Special team equipment and

weapons should be locked in the trunk of the vehicle until needed. The trunk key

should be carefully hidden so as to make it difficult to search the trunk in case

law enforcement agents should stop the car on some pretext with the intention of

searching it illegally.

WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT

Selection pi weapons and supplies should give the combat Team maximum

flexibility to meet any condition that may be encountered in either rural or urban

warfare. Consideration should be given to all possible situations that may de-

velop relating to both traditional guerrilla warfare and modern underground war-

fare techniques. It should be kept in mind that the Combat Team is a functional

part of a resistance network. It's activities should be coordinated with other

teams to take maximum advantage of its striking powers.

Disregarding the inclusion of weapons peculiar to a given mission, the

standard distribution of men and weapons could be as follows:

#1

#2

#3

#4

(Team Lieutenant) AR-180 Assault Rifle, automatic pistol, sheath

knife, flare gun, and binoculars. 300 rounds of ammunition load-

ed in clips should be carried for the rifle, plus 50 extra rounds of

ammunition for the pistol.

(Team Member) Riot Shotgun, automatic pistol, sheath knife, and

wire cutters (with insulated handles). 100 rounds of No. 4 Buck-

shot in pouches for the shotgun, and 50 rounds of pistol ammunition.

(Team Member) AR-180 Assault Rifle, automatic pistol, sheath

knife, and smoke grenades or flares.

300 rounds of ammunition

in clips for the rifle, and 50 rounds of pistol ammunition.

(Team Sergeant) AR-180 Assault Rifle, automatic pistol, sheath

kuife, flare gun, and binoculars. Ammunition requirement is

the same as #1 man.

#5

#6

(Team Member) M1903 Springfield Rifle with sniper scope, auto-

matic pistol, sheath knife, and entrenching shovel. 100 rounds of

AP ammunition in bandoleers for the rifle, and 50 rounds of pis -

tol ammunition.

(Team Member) AR-180 Assault Rifle, automatic pistol, sheath

kaife, and 30 feet of climbing rope with grappling hook. Ammu-

nition requirement is the same as #1 man.

ADDITIONAL MATERIAL

In addition to the weapons and supplies already listed each team member

should have the following basic equipment:

a.

b.

c.

Sleeping bag and waterproof ground cloth

Canteen (1 quart army type)

Survival rations for three days

First aid kit

€.

f.

g.

h.

MPLESS

HOME-M.4DE EXPEDIENTS

CHERRY BOMB

12 powders from cherry bombs

1 fuse from cherry bomb

one snuff can 2" high and 1" across

about 50 bebes

After powder and bebes are in can put lid on. Take ice pick, punch hole in top of lid. Slip fuse

Then cover can completely with airplane glue around the base of the fuse to hold in place bet-

ter when thrown.

PLASTIC

Potassium Chlorate

Petroleum Jelly (Vaseline)

A round wooden stick or rolling pin

Spread the Potassium Chlorate thinly on a hard surface. Roll the round stick (rolling pin) over the

crystals to crush them into a very fine powder (until it looks like face powder). Take 9 parts of the

powdered Potassium Chlorate and one part of vaseline, and knead them together until a uniform

paste is obtained. Detonate with a blasting cap or with a . 30 caliber fused blank.

BLACK POWDER

Potassium Nitrate - 25 parts

Charcoal - 3 parts

Sulphur - 2 parts

Dissolve the Potassium Nitrate in an equal amount of water. Pulverize the charcoal and sulphur,

and add the Potassium Nitrate solution to obtain a thoroughly wet paste. Allow to dry.

FAST BURNING FUSE

Twist soft cotten string into three strands. Moisten black powder to form a paste and rub the

paste into the twisted string Burns 30 to 40 inches per minute.

SLOW BURNING FUSE

Dissolve one part of Potassium Nitrate or Potassium Chlorate and one part of sugar (granulated)

in two parts of hot waler.

Soak the string in this solution. Twist the string into three strands and

allow to dry. Burns about 2 inches per minute.

FUSES

Fuses can be made by soaking course paper in a solution of gun powder and acetone (nail polish re-

mover) overnight, then drying. Cut strips and twist together. Also, by coating a cotton string with

a sticky substance, then dipping into gunpowder, coating all surfaces. A time delay fuse that car

be used without a match is made as follows: Make a small pile of potassium permanganate and make

a small pile of it on the ground, making a hole in the center.of it. Next pour in the hole about an

equal amount of straight glycerine. A flash will occur in about one minute. This method is best

used when gun powder has to be used as a fuse... or for starting fires.

PACKAGE BOM.3

JELLIED GASOLINE

-Pour the contents of one bottle (1 pint 3 oz.) of Dynamo concentrated liquid laundry detergent into a

bucket or large mouthed can of about two to five gallon size. Fill the detergent bottle twice, shaking

well to rinse it out with gasoline (any grade) and add it to the detergent. You will now have about

3 1/2 pints (57 oz) of material in the bucket. The detergent will be at the bottomandthe gasoline on

the top. Stir this rapidly with a wooden or wire paddle so as to mix in as much air as possible. Soun

the mixture will take on the appearance of soft vasoline.

Now add in a gallon of gasoline and stir again until the mixture thickens. At this point, transfer the

mixture to clean containers. No return type beer and soda bottles are ideal. For chemical land

mines, use two gallon oil cans. The container should be filled approximately one third full of the

Finish filling the container with gasoline leaving a little air space at the top. Place your

finger or hand over the opening and shake well until the gasoline and mixture amalgamate. You can

verify this by looking at the finger or hand occasionally to see if a film of jellied gasoline about an

eighth of an inch thick clings to it. When proper consistency is reached, the bottles may be capped or

corked. Cans should have tight fitting lids screwed on.

This may be stored up to two weeks. Tie

a rag around the neck of each bottle being careful not to leave the ends of the rag too long or too loose.

If necessary, this mixture can be "cut" 50'% with gasoline or other petroleum product. The tendency

to "cling" will suffer slightly, but consistency can be maintained by pouring off the excess gasoline

whenever the detergent refuses to "take'' any more.

To use, saturate the rag with gasoline or the mixture from the bottle. Keep the flamable material

off of your person and clothing.

Light the rag with match or cigarette lighter and immediately serve.

Throw hard against a solid object such as masonry, concrete, or metal. In using the mixture in

a chemical land mine, wrap three or four wraps.of pri macord around a two gallon can and tie the prim-

acord under the can around a pound of explosive.

This may be exploded either electrically or by a per-

cussion such as a booby trap device or anti-personell fuse. Do not contact wires to the blasting

machine until after you have carefully removed all traces of your work and camouflaged the position.

Never us any plastic article in contact with the above misture.

"Deputy District Attorney

"County of San Diego

"Dear Sir:

"I have received your letter of August 10, 1972.

As regarded in your letter, I will testily.

However, I do

so reluctantly for several reasons.

First, I am in an

extremely critical financial situation and my time and

presence in this area are o= utmost importance to me in

getting re-established. Furthernore, I am not happy about

the prospect of having my identity and location generally

known.

As you are probably well aware, several close

associates of memiers of the Secret Army Organization live

within a few miles of me. This situation has caused my

wife to become extremely distraught, and she refuses to

remain here alone with the children

without adequate

protection. Needless to say, I am not presently financially

able to take my family on a lengthy or time consuming trio.

Another thing to be considered is that school vegins here

on August 25th and my children would need to be here to

enroll and attend classes.

"It has also occurred to me that, as in the Grand

Jury proceedinge, it will be unlawful fos

me to testify

without prior elcarance from the U.S. Attorney General's

Office.

Your letter did not indicate whether this had

already ieen taken care of.

"And then there is the problem of my testimony

itseli.

It would possibly implicate me in

violation of

the

saw,

and I do not wish to spend even a part of my

life being concerned with sucr

a prospect.

"There are also other questions, such os anticipated

"Respectfully,

"S/STEVEN I. CHRISTENSEN

P. O. Box 2

Kanosh, Utah

With regard to questions asked by CHRISTENSEN in his

letter, HEWICKER stated that he has confersed with CHRISTENSEN'S

attorney KEVIN MC INERNY regarding the question of possibly

furnishing immunity to CHRISTENSEN fos his testimony. He

advised that CHRISTENSEN will not be granted immunity and he

has advised MC INERNEY that he and former SA CHRISTENSEN

will have to rely on his word that no action will be taken

to charge CHRISTENSEN as a result of any testimony that he

might give.

CHRISTENSN's expenses including his transportation

to san Diego and his

expenses while in San Diego will be paid

by the county. No action will be taken by the county to

transport Mrs. CHRISTENSIN or their children to San Diego or

to provide protection for them in Utah during the course oi

the trial.

CHRISTENSEN will probably be needed for approximately

ono week, boginning 9/7/72, inasmuch as HLWICKER feels that

CHRISTENSEN will be needed for rebuttal testimony.

Me. HWICK.R ic propazing a set of questions which

the prosecution will ask CHRISTUNSEN auring direct testimony

during this trial. Those questions will be furnished to

the San Diego Office, possibly on 3/25/72, for transmittal

to the Bureau and to

the Justice Department.

Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) ROBERT H.

FILSINGER Will De Turnished a set of the questions which

will be asked former SA CHRISTENSEN and the Bureau will be

advised of any comments he might have concerning CHRISTENSEN'S

testimony in this case.

The National Socialist White People's

the American Nazi

Party, American Nazis, and the George

Lincoln Rockwell Party, was organized

National Socialist White People's Party.

Napier was questioned about any information he

might have concerning possible secret groups being formed

in the Los Angeles area and he stated he had heard about

a group called the Secret Army Organization that was in

Napier claimed the only contact he had with the Secret Army

Organization was from a pamphlet he had received from this

He said they are strictly anti-communistic and Pro-American

in their approach.

On February 9, 1971

By JERONE

I contacted the mystery man last night at

Denny's Restaurant and it turned out to be ISAAC CANTRELL.

He told me that he previously lived in Arizona and

because of some trouble or difficulty there, moved to

Los Angeles, California.

He said he believed he had been followed to

Los Angeles.

He subsequently moved to the san Diego area

and is now living in Alpine.

We talked about his recent arrest on charges

of violating firearms laws and he said the charges

against him have been dismissed. He said he thinks

the local authorities are still watching him, and that

they may try to arrest him again if they get the chance.

He said he still has most of his stuff for

working on firearms but indicated that the articles which

were confiscated at the time of his arrest had not been

returned to him.

As an additional note of interest, he told me :

he had been in contact with BOB DE PUGH and

WALTER PZYSON

at Phoenix, Arizona, approximately three months before

they were arrested.

I plan to proceed slowly in my contacts with

CANTRiLL as he may be a set-up for the local or state

authorities.

The photograph of RONALD TIMOTHY DONENICK

is not famillar to me.

However, I will scout around

and see if I can find out something about him:

I was talking to SAM DAVIS yesterday. He told

me he recently came close to killing a police officer

and explained that he and GEORGE HOOVER were hauling a

trunk full of machine guns in one of their cars when

they were stopped because they had a bad headlight.

DAVIS said he got out to mee the officer and

and had a .45 caliber pistol under his belt on his back

and a hand grenade in each pocket of his jacket. He

said HOOVER, who stayed in the car, was covering him with

a Thompson sub-machine gun. He said if the officer had

tried to look in the car they probably would have had

to kill him.

CANTRELL and I have set up a method whereby

there will be a live minute period of time each week

during which I can contact him at a specified telephone

number.

Attached are some printed materials from the

National Center for the Exploration of Human Potential.

These items were obtained a while ago by the Minutement

from the files of the Message Information Center.

EXPERIENCING COMMUNITY

THE TORI EXPERIENCE

The TORI community starts with several

experiences designed to build a sense of com-

munity, and to deepen personal growth.

Stemming from these experiences, the

community unfolds and emerges. Each mem-.

ber has an opportunity to participate in this •

process and to influence the unfolding in

significant lays. The community becomes

• a powerful medium for personal change.

Members trave an opportunity to relate in-

tensely and openly to many others in a variety

of situations. They are free to try out new

ways of being and doing. Each participant

is responsifie for his own learning, and has

a variety o: options and choices during the

weekend. Each person, in a significant sense,

creates his own experience and his own com-

munity environment.

The TORi experiences (trust, openness,

realization, and interdependence) emerge

from the community interaction. They are

seen as central to the growth of the person

as well as to the development of community.

The basic TORI theory will be presented by

Dr. Jack R. Gibb as it is applied to the build-

ing of a sense of community in classrooms,

neighborhoods, congregations, families, and

the total school or business system.

Sandra La Boon, who will be conducting

the workshop, has worked with Dr. Gibb over

the past two years in a wide variety of group

NW 55009 DocId: 32989524 Page 1203

experiences. She has conducted groups with

the Center, Y.M.C.A.'s of Los Angeles and

San Diego and with the Methodist Church.

She is currently conducting research with Dr.

Gibb on the TORI theory.

DESIGN

The community is built upon 24 hours of

experiences over a three-day period. Parti.

cipants should plan to attend for all 24 hours.

No observers will be admitted although parti-

cipants will have freedom to participate in an

experience or not. We start after dinner, 7:30

PM on Friday. The Experience ends 5:00 PM

on Sunday. It is not necessary to stay over

night at the Inn.

CLOTHING

The dress should be comfortable and in-

formal, so you can sit on the floor and go

barefooted or wear socks.

SCHEDULE

Friday night from 7:30 pim. - 11:00 p.m..

Saturday from 9:00 a.m. - 11:00 p.m.

Sunday from 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.

MEALS

Meals are an integral part of the experience

and participants should plan to have all meals

with the group. There is no additional charge

for meals.

Cost of the training is S25.00.

The training will be in the evening November 22, 23, and 24th, 7:30 to 10:00 P.M. at the National Center

8080 El Paseo Grande, La Jolla, California.

In order to be eligible to take the leader training it will have been necessary for each potential leader to

have experienced a complete TORI weekend.

For the first time we will be providing a program to train leaders in conducting the TORI Community

Experience.

DOES FROW DUR NEW ME. ERSHIP DIRECTOR

Dear Fellow Member:

As your new membership director I would like to tell you how excited

am about the exciting things that are happening at the National Center..

But, before I go into that, let me tell you how I became associated with

the ultimate beauty in the world is the human being--you and me--each

I came to the Harvard Business School from New Delhi, India, in May,

with the intention of acquiring the skills to go and capture for myself

treasures of the outside world.

Oh: I was determined to be relentless i

my seeking, and if someone got hurt. or had to be hurt, it was going to t

all in the line of business.

Now, having gotren my MBA and having started work on my Ph.D. in Leac

i ship and Human Behavior at USIU, I'm realizing that there is something e

more important: for me to. do, and this is to strive to tap more of my owi

: inner,

infinite potentialities.. to strive for growth as a person, to mai

myself a beautiful work of art.

The real treasure lies within me, not

... outside of me: Well, I'm embarked

on this journey-on this adventure ir

becoming more of a person.

But I have realized too, that I can do this only with the help of oti

people.

I can only actualize my infinite potentialities by helping othe

actualize theirs.

And so, I accepted the responsibility that Al Lewis i

quested

me to take up--and I have launched the 1970 Fall Membership Drit

My goal is to double our present membership, l.e., to increase the numbe

of Participating Members by at. least 240 by December, 1970.

That's the

very least the Center must do. That's the smallest increase my conscier

will allow me. Our long range goal is to reach out to the millions in :

I have made arrangements whereby I can contact

ISAAC CANTRELL at a

pay telephone during a five minute period

of time once a week.

The next scheduled contact period is

for the middle of next week.

He wants to be contacted at

that time as he wants to have some phony identification

made up for him. He feels he needs this extra identification

in order to hide out or conceal himself in the event it looks

though the authorities are going to try to bust him again.

He apparently Is still capable of producing his

homemade machine guns, and there is some indication he may be

willing to trade a completed model of this machine gun for

the phoney identification.

Nothing specticular happened, and I was unable

to listed to the speakers as I was forced to leave early.

This was because B. J. BYSTROll, who knows me very well,

was circulating around and I did not want to be recognized.

jubstantive parts of the motion on the People's Peace Treaty

We move that this Association (organization, institution) endorse a people's

reaty with the people of Viet Nam,

• The President of the Association (organization, institution) shall appoint a

omission with a mandate

(A) to communicate this motion to the Vietnamese people

(B) to engage in discussions with representatives of the Democratic Republic

f Viet Nam, the Provisional Revolutionary Governmoha, other popular forces, and

cademic colleagues seeking peace and independence in Viet Nam in order to engage

n academic cooperation and exchange, and

(C) to study and recommend ways and

means to withdraw the resources of this

ssociation (organization, institution) from further support from this war.

Prior to May 1, 1971 (a year and a day after the U.S. invasion of Cambodia) this

omission shall report to the membership on the progress of its work and of pro-

osals for further action implementing the motion.

xplanatory Material

In opinion polls and in direct tests on the ballot, most recently in Detroit,

je American people have shown themselves to favor immediate and total withdrawal

rom Viet Nam,

Furthermore, the Nixon Administration, aware of this growing majority, has consis-

ently claimed to be ending the war. But the facts arc disheartening. Two years

ive passed. American bombing of Laos has sharply increased. American troops

ive invaded Cambodia and then lert the ARV to contime open warfare in that

eviously quiet country, with massive air support from U.S. forces. The devas -

ition of South Viet Nam has continued. And playing ucon the anxiety of Americans

n Vii Nam evorr weok. Hoparently the Administration has defined "ending the war"

• Lowering the level of American battle casualties and the number of American ground

rous in Viet Nam to a point that the American people will accept. But this defin-

cion permits the indefinite extension if suffering and destruction in Indochina

rought by American aerial hombardment and other technology, and ground fighting

Asian mercenaries and conscripts.

At the same time the Nixon Administration has misrepresented the highly volatile

olitical developments in the U.S. - held cities of South Viet Nam, where there has

een rising and open opposition to the Thieu-Ky-Kiem regime and to the American pre-

ence, by students, war veterans, women, workers, intellectuals, journalists, Buddhists

nd others. These groups are openly willing to communicate with the NLE, and to enter

nto a coalition with the Provisional Revolutionary Govt, of South Viet Nam (PRG)

For that reason it is urgent that the PRG proposal (Paris. Sebt. 17, 1970) receive

Cair consideration. It sets forth the following principles as the basis for a just

and honorable peace: (1) the total withdrawal of all U.S. military forces from Viet

Jam by a date to be specified by the U.S. - porhaps June 30, 1971, as in the

Hatfield - McGover! amendment; (2) total withdrawal of all U.S. military and econom-

ic support of the Thien-Ky-Kiem regime: (3) total non-intervention by the U.S. in the

intrissal pulitical affairs of Viet Nam. When these conditions are met the Vietnamese

will (2) form a Provisional Coalition Government ravresenting all independent and dem

ocratic forces and hold free general eloctions in all of S. Viet Nam: (2) release im

mediately all captured soldiers and political orisoners: and (3)refrain from attacking

U.S, forces in the process of withdrawal.

The U.S. loverument has not taken these steps, nor has it even taken the uroros-

als seriously, so far as anvoue klows.

The neoule of Viet Nam and the neople of the

U.S. both want U.S. withdraval; with the U.S. Government preventing it, it seems

necessary for citizens and for

glouds to cease depending on the Government and

to attempt dircut contait with the Viotnamese. The endorsement of the Peonle s

Peace Treats, as proused in this motion, is the natural way to proceed toward that

enri.

On February 13, 1971

By JERONE

Yesterday I checked the Minutemen Post Office

Box in Spring Valley and found an answer to the letter

we sent to the new Minutement group in Elgin, Illinois.

The envelope was post marked February 8, 1971, and so

has probably been in the Post Office Box for several

days. The contents were wrapped in true Minutement

fashion and copies are attached.

I will have to have

the original back for future business.

I showed the letter to SAM DAVIS last night.

He was fasinated and excited by the letter and immediately

called JIM POTO who is back in town from Phoenix, Arizona.

POTO, in turn, is suppose to have tried to make arrange-

ments for myself, POTo, and DAVIS to contact EV MOORE,

Saturday, February 20,

1971, at the Gun show In ruma,

Arizona.

MOORE, who resides in Phoenix, is suppose to

be a big Minutemen leader who was close

up under dE PuGh.

He may possibly have been the counter part of TROY

HOUGHTON which would have made him the regional coordinator

of the linutemen organization in Arizona.

He is said

to have some excellent contacts on the east coast.

If it is not possible for us to meet at Yuma,

we will then call on MOORE at Phoenix some time in the

next couple of weeks.

POTO, who I understand just barely returned

from Arizona,

has advised that Moore has been wanting

to make some

contacts in the San Diego area.

According

to POTO, possible reasons for this would be that-pero MOORE

is tied up with the new group at Elgin, Illinois, and

does not want the de LUGH lamily to regain control oi

che organization. Furthermore, it does not appear that

the new Minutement group has a

regional coordinator for

the Southern California area at this time and MOORE

may be wanting to find someone to nominate.

Dess Mr Morgan:

We are most happy to hear from you and to find out that

there are still some loyal members left in the sandiego area.

We are the same organization minus the family of Bob Depugh

and a lew of the parasites who moved in on the old National

headquarters at Norborne. So there is nothing to do really

other than pick up were

you left off and continue

to work

along our original goals.

We have had to increase security somewhat but not too

much I hope to prevent us meeting some time in the future.

I enclose a febauary bulletin for your files, Keep us informed

as: to the

situation in your area.

Yours for America,

Som Demain.

Thomas H. DeMain.

Secretary, National

Coordinating Center.

JANUARY BULLETIN

A new year is upon us and there is much to report both good and bad concerning

our struggle for a free America.

We will dwell shortly on the bad news first: Many of you have inquired about

the fate of Thomas K. Stewart who has been indicted on several counts of Armed

Robery stemming from a series of very successful raids against the Socialist

Worker's Party and The Young Socialist Alliance. The trials on all these charges

are atill pending and Mr. Stewart 1s out on $30,000.00 bond at this time. The

arrangements of legal council and tactics have kept a number of the staff here at

the National Coordinating Center busy for quite some time. The cost of all this

as you can well imagine has been very high, but it is our sworn auty to do all we

can for Patriots such as Tom Stewart. As for more information about the case,

the logal aspects are better if we make no public comment. at this time.

Suffice it to say that the cases are heavy on our minds at this time.

The good news is somewhat more extensive, and is as follows:

The recruiting drive up and down the east coast is going very well and

we will soon be over our goals there.

2. The reaganization of the regions is nearing completion with only several

Regional directors left to be appointed.

3, The printing and reprinting of material is proceeding at a slow but

steady pace,

As of this time the two most important considerations we have are security

and recruiting. We urge all members to try and finish their training Phase as

fast as possible, but for the interim we will enclose as part of this Bulletin a copy

of Practical Securily measures which we feel all members should read and put into

practice as soon as possible.

The full report on the S,D.S. Convention which was heid in Chicago on

December 27üh ihrough December 30th, This exiensive report will be available

io ail members for the cost. of printing alone.

2. Use deceptive measures. Subscribe to one or more left-wing periodicals or get on th

mailing list of some 'peace movement'. This will keep the postal inspectors guessing as

• Of many left-wing organizations or write to National Headquarters for this information. W

doing this our members can be of great assistance in searching this left-wing literature fo

names and addresses of fellow travelers and forwarding this information for our Central

Intelligence files. We desperately need people to assist in this work. Please inquire as

detailed instructions for such activity.

• 3.

Always use two envelopes in sending mail to any patriotic organization or to any

other member of our organization. Do not put a return address on the outer envelope. Put

your return address on the inside envelope with the words, "Return postage guaranteed"

4. Place some opaque material such as tin foil, carbon paper, etc. between the inner

and outer envelopes to prevent your mail from being read by infra-red cameras.

5. Send all letters from corner mail boxes or from post offices where you are not known.

6. Be cardful in the use of the telephone. Avoid telephone calls to National Headquarte

or to known members of the organization as much as possible.

• 7... Prepare telephone codes ahead of time for future protection.

8. In recruiting new members always learn as much as you can about the prospective

recruit and make sure he is not an infiltrator before you identify yourself as a member of

the organization.

9. Members of the organization in each area should be divided into four groups.

A. Those who have been identified publicly or by law enforcement

agencies as members of the Minutemen,

B. Those persons not known as members of this organization but who

are generally known as being patriots.

C. Those persons who have kept their political beliefs hidden.

D. Members who profess to be liberal for the purpose of infiltrating

enemy organizations.

All members should be very careful in making contaci with persons in a different category

than themselves. For example, people in Class D should be very secret in their.con-

tacts and communications with persons of Class A or Class B. Each member must respect

the security of every other member, Do not, under any circumstances, identily one membe

of the organization even to other members without his expressed permission on cach and

every occasion.

10. Avoid loose talk, Do not discuss organiza lonal plans in public places where you

NecRop be Dorerheatap52bo Froe dran hint at such a discussion in the presence of non-member.

## Page 1228

¿Do not write patriotic letters to newspapers or magazines under your own name. To.

so achleves very little except to identify you to the enemy.

12.

It you are already known as a patriot, or as a member of this organization you may

find advisable to spread the rumor that you have become disillusioned with the right-

wing or for you to pretend a gradual loss of interest.

13. Classify your various members adaresses, your communications and your other ac-

tivities as 'top secret', 'secret' or 'restricted'. Use your most secretlines of communica-

tion only for the most important messages rather than flooding them with unimportant mater-

lal,

14. Demand obedience to all security measures from all members, Persistent disregard

for security measures should be cause for disciplinary action.

15,. Check your lines of communication from time to time by sending phoney messages to

make certain they are not intercepte.

16. Change mail drops, meeting places, etc, frequently.

17. Prepare secret rendezvous points, mail drops.

etc. now that may be used in time of

some future emergency.

18. Each band should assign some member the rank of Security Officer and should set

up a system of fines.or other penalties for failure to comply with

security precautions.

19, Observe the 'need to know" rule. Each member should be given only that informatior

which is needed by him in the performance of his duty or which he will need in cooperating

with other members of the band. No member should feel 'left out' because he is denied

such information. Instead every member should willingly avoid information which he does

notreed.

20. Be careful that you are not followed in going to and from meeting places or in makir

contac: with other members of the organization.

21. Keep all records and correspondence carefully hidden and in a manner that they can

be easily destroyed. Records should be kept in code whenever possible.

22, Important as secrecy may be, It is not the only essential factor in a successful

underground movement. Morale and efficiency are equally important. Elaborate security

measures aiways. reduce efficiency to a greater or lesser degree. Unnecessary security

can create an atmosphere of suspicion that is devastating to the esprit de corps of any

organization, Find a proper balance between security and efficiency.

ON FEBRUARY 23, 1971

EY JEROME

ISAAC CANTRELL was contacted last night. He said

he would make avallable, 5 or 6. 45 caliber machine gun

barrels. He said these can be picked up Friday, the 26th

of February, from another person, not CANTRELI.

He said

he will also make contact with a person in Nevada who

owns a mine and who can furnish large quantities of dynamite.

CANTRELI still appears to be paranoid and claims

he is followed about three days a week by someone driving

a red Datsun or Toyota automobile.

CANTRELL did considerable talking about police

officer BUD BENNETT.

This is apparently the officer

responsible for CANTRELL's recent arrest and CANTRELL

available information regarding BENNETT such as his home

address and telephone number and the license number and

description of the automobile which he drives.

CANTRELL also claimed he has a case of dynamite

buried in the vicinity or Indio, California.

A right wing individual named DAVE KNORR was

contacted last week.

He claimed to know of the existence

of a group of Minutemen (MM) at Alpine, Califoria.

He

said these persons are always interested in purchasing

weapons.

While at the gun show at Yuma, Arizona, last weekend,

he met an individual named BOB KYLE who is supposed to be

JERRY GEYER's best friend. KYLE had

several magazines for

..the Russian AK 47 automatic rifle which sold very fast..

KYLE's wife is named GINGER. KYLE is about 5'7" tall,

dark complexion,

dark hair,

30-35 years old.

He may work

at some local military base as he seems to have excellent

access to parts to military weapons.

It was mentioned that

he does some dealing with Marines at Camp Pendleton.

Another of GEYER's friends who was at the gun show

was LARRY STORCH (PH) who had a fairly large number of

weapons to seel.

He was about 30 years old,

6'2" tall, or

taller, dark brown hair.

(Possibly identical with LARRY

STORTS, a former San Diego police officer who left the

department to go to law school.)

PETER RUPLINGER was contacted yesterday and

the photograph of MORRIS STARSKEY was shown to him.

He

said that for sometime now, he has been trying to find out

Who STARSKEY is and has even been following him from time

to time looking for a chance to pick up his briefcase.

RUPLINGER said he has also been following LEON NOWERS

around

the campus, the

last time being the day before yesterday.

He said on

that day, NOWERS went to the Student Placement

Office, where he reviewed the files maintained there on

FBI and CIA employment.

He said he believes possibly

NOWERS was looking for names of students who are applying

or have applied for work with these Government agencies.

There is a rumor going around that the Minutemen

may try to stage some opposition to any san Diego area

anti-war activities to be held on 4/15/71.

To the best oi my knowleage, I have not heara of

any Mn or other right wingers being involved in a Confederate

skirmish unit at Ramona, California, as reported in yesterday's

Evening Tribune.

It has been leared that last Friday, SAM DAVIS

was doing a lot of talking about shooting people. He said

even il he eventuarly leave this area, he wire make some

trips back for the purpose of eliminating some people.

He then said that at one time, he almost killed a girlfriend

Of GEORGE HOOVER.

She was then living at the ranch with

HOOVER but returned to Germany, where she was born, when

they broke up.

DAVIS said he was in favor of killing her because

she apparently knew too much and wanted to set up a shooting

accident at the ranch to get rid of her.

GEORGE HOOVER

vetoed. the idea however, and they. let her retum to Germany..

Last Sunday, at the Gunsmoke Ranch, it was observed

that a complex range

system has been set up there.

There are

many people who come there frequently to practice and sometimes

there are as many as 50 persons present.

Last Sunday, STAN

MC DADE and his son, BARRY GODFREY, ROGER WILLIS, a FRANK LNU

and 4 other people were there practicing. It was observed that

several of these people are quite proficient on the range

and in the handling the use of their weapons.

He observed

"that STAN MC DADE and BARRY GODFREY, while digging through

a pile ot junk on the range, came across a piece of a .50

caliber machine gun, which is interesting.

It is known that BETTIE HOUGHTON has always wanted

to be interviewed by FBI about the disappearance of her husband,

TROY and now might be even more willing to discuss matters

relating to her husband and to DEPUGH.

Report of Jerome

PETER RUPLINGER was contacted this morning.

He

claims that there will be nine buses going from San Diego

State to the anti-war demonstration at San Fransisco on

the twentyfourth of this month. He said he will find out

later from where and when

they

are leaving and how many

people will be on the buses.

He knows about the $900 given

the demonstrators by the school and will try to find out if

they get any more money from other. sources.

STAN MO DADE was also contacted this morning and

was accompanied by HONARD CLEVELAND. It was learned that

NC DADE and HOWARD GODFREY were at Camp Pendleton yesterday

looking at the scrap parts pile of the Ordnance Disposal

unit there.

They believe there may be several complete

weapons of various kinds which could be made from the scrap

For this reason they are considering submitting a

bid on the some forty tons of

scrap which is to be sold.

It was learned that JOHN BUSH. is also going to enter a bid.

MC DADE and CLEVELAND indicated they are going to

the deseret in the morning to spend several days doing some

shooting and exploring.

BY JEROME

SAM DAVIS was contacted yesterday. He had been

to BETTIE HAUGHTON's place and had received from her the

complete list of former Minuteman members which was in her

possession.

She is also going to give him all the field

manuals she has, several cases of them,

and her medical

supplies.

SAM said he also believes he knows the identity

of the man who helped TROY HAUGHTON bury his caches of

weapons and supplies in the Sierras.

Included in this

stuff is supposed to be an entire packaged Army field

hospital which was allegedly stolen from the military. SAM

said he will try to get acgauinted with this person.

: A person named DON CAREY has come to my attention.

He is also known as DON VON BECK and HENNING VON BECK. He

•clams to be the son of a World War. II German general named

VON BECK. He works as a blaster for Canyon Rock and Gravel

Company and has told people he has a cabin near Campo and

three rented garages in which he has stored a lot of weapons,

parts,

1ot

, of talk. I will try to find out more about him.

Report of Jerome

SAM DAVIS was overheard to say that an individual

named RON ZARiCKis one of the biggest weapons suppliers in

the San Diego area and can usually get anything that SAM

asks him for.

This is supposed to be one of SAM's contacts

who is trying to get him a grease gun or a Sten gun.

It was also learned that a woman named LILLIAN

(INU) is coming down from Los Angeles next week. She is

the wife of the owner of A R Sales and will be in town to

take an order from SAM for some M-15 comversion kits. A R

Sales allegedly has a huge inventory of weapons parts and

Is also supposed to be dealing in automatic weapons.

•SAM claimed to have purchased $500 worth of M-2

conversion parts from TOM FORREST last month. He indicated

that most or all of these parts would go to the Cuban

refugees through LOU CONDE.

time he

stated that he had just gobten off work at 8:00 a.m. after

working an eight hour shift.

He said he had read in the paper

the article concerning the bombing of an IRS office at San Joses

California but that he has heard nothing from DAVIS or BROWN.

During. the forenoon of 7/5/71: STEVE LOGAN Of ATFD, IRS,

telephoned and asked the writer to contact source and have him

contact DAVIS to see what DAVIS had to say and to see if he was

in San Diego. After clearing this with Súpervisor #4, source

was contacted and he said he would contact DAVIS on some pretext.

Informant drove to DAVIS's house and enroute he was stopped

by the Highway Patrol who checked out his identification.

REPORT BY JEROME

I was in telephone contact with SAM DAVIS today.

He appears to be very hooked on joining the American

Nazi Party.

STAN MC DADE is the one who is pushing the

hardest on joining the Nazis.

I understand that DAVIS

and MC DADE

will get together to look for office space

for the Nazi Party headquarters in the San Diego area.

DAVIS also said he is going out tomorrow to

lind some office equipment

for this purpose.

He said

there is a possibility that the local group may get some

financial help from the Nazi Party at Los Angeles.

DAVIS also advised he knows of the whereabouts

of one of TROY HAUGHTON's old hideouts.

He said this

hideout is still in tact and usable and that he, DAVIS,

might have to make use of it himself if things get to

hot for him in San Diego. He mentioned that HAUGHTON stayed

in this hideout for a long period of time on one occasion

when the police department was looking for him..

It was

thought that he was not in town because they had been unable

to Ilna nim. DaVIs said,

to the best of his knowledge, the

Location of the hideout is now known only to him and BETTIE

HAUGHTON.

which hasis DAVIS will want returned to him, with the exception

of the blasting caps, do not represent any violation of lav

would be roturned to the ownor

in this mattor, they interposed no objection to returning to

DAVIS deactivated or inort blasting caps, feeling that the

record of their possession by the Government and disposition

would serve as

well for evidence purposes as having the caps

themselves.

On 8/3/71 SGI. WILLIAM BIRCH, 70th Ordnance Detach

ment (EOD), Fort. Rosecrans, San Diego, Calffornia, advised

that thore is no effective way that the blasting caps in

question could be deactivated without extreme danger to the

attempting this action and without it being obvious that

the caps had been tampered with. ST. BIRCH advised that the

manufacturers ci

all such blasting caps make inert caps mich

for training and identification purposes which are indistin

guishible from the live ones..

said that in his opinion

the best course of action would be to obtain such inert caos

to substitue for the ones now in the possession of the

Govern-

ment.

He said that the best source of information

as to where

to obtain these substitues would be the Institut of Hakers

I was in contact with PAUL RUPLINGER. He continued

to be interested in creating disturbances and offered to

take Right Wing leaders for a drive along Interstate 8 to

show them where they could use dynamite on underpasses and

overpasses to create the most disruption. It has been learned

that SAM DAVIS and BARRY GODFREY may drive up to Los Angeles

tomorrow to contact the people who own and run AR Sales, for

the purpose of finding out about the availability of military

manuals and various weapons.

DAVIS, GODFREY and MC DADE continue to talk about

setting up a new organization to handle Right wing activities

in the San Diego area. Arrangements have been made for them

to meet soon at a drive-in restaurant to talk about ways

and means of setting up such an organization with a legal

defense fund, a newspaper or bulletin and harassment

activities.

I have heard there will be an American Legion

march in downtown San Diego on Sunday, 4/4/71, to protest

the court-martial of Lt. WILLIAM CALLEY. This march

is being sponsored partially by Radio Station KSON and all

Right wing groups in the San Diego area are being urged

to join in.

A call has been put out for 50,000 participants

to the best of my knowledge, no parade permit has been

obtained from the San Diego Police Department.

I was in

contact with one of the women who is pushing the march. She

has telephone 276-6648.

According to her, the march will

start about 12 NOON from the Navy Recreation Field at Harbor

Drive and Market Street, will proceed up Harbor Drive to

8ch Avenue,

from there to Broadway and then back to Harbor

Drive and the recreation Field for a rally.

The woman

told me they have received 3700 phone alls

since last

night.

She said the march seems to be getting much support

from the military, adding that two Generals and three Colonels

have indicated they will participate in the march in full

uniforn.

I was in contact with SAM DAVIS last night.

He claimed to have received a call earlier in the

evening from the Klu Klux Klan in Mississippi. The

only explanation he would give is that something he was

involved in there broke open and he is afraid he may be

arrested soon.

If so, he says he knows who is responsible

and he will take care of them later. However, he is very

shaken up and has been talking about going underground until

the problem blows over.

In the past he has claimed to have

been involved in robberies, burglaries, and illegal weapons

deals which may account for what he is afraid of now.

However, if he is still in town on sunday, he

will join in the march protesting the trial of It. CALLEY

and may try to start a confrontation if people show up to

demonstrate against the march.

It has been learned that SAM DAVIS and GEORGE

HOOVER left yesterday morning to go to a construction

project in Arizona.

They intend to make use of this trip

to make contacts with people they know or have heard of in

Las Vegas, Phoenix, and El Paso.

They are supposed to call

back after making these contacts. DAVIS left his brief-case

with BARRY GODFREY and because of what happened in Mississippi,

was talking about the possibility of going underground but

sneaking back to the San Diego area later on.

The person to be contacted in Phoenix is EV MoORe.

DAVIs claims that of the Right fing groups that

are still intact, the one at Las vegas is the best run

and is already functioning. He said it is supposed to have

Mafia connections and is also the best source of many kinds

of supplies.

DAVIS wants the San Diego area Post Office Box

which was rented in BILL CLAY's name dropped and a new Post

Office Box rented so that CLAY cannot get at the mail:

I was in contact with SAM DAVIS yesterday.

He had come from BETTIE HAUGHTON's place.

She gave him

the entire former Minuteman membership list which

she had in her possession, along with cases of field

manuals and other literature as well as a large quantity

of medical supplies and items. DAVIS seems to think

he knows the name of the person who helped TROY HAUGHTON

bury many of his supplies in the Sierras, included among

which is supposed to be a whote packaged Army field

hospital which they stole somewhere.

I have come across an individual named DON

CAREY.

He is also known as DON VON BECK and to some people

as HENNING VON BECK. He claims to be the son of the

German World War II General named VON BECK. He is a blaster

for Canyon Rock and Gravel Company. He impresses, me as being

a big talker but claims to have a cabin at Campo and three

rented garages full of weapons, incluäng machine guns,

weapons parts, ammunition and explosives.

SAM claims that he can order me a.Sten gun for $100.

He also says that TOM FORREST is one of his two San Diego

suppliers but that ne makes most of his purchases in Washington

and Oregon. DAVIS claims he has been dealing with FORREST

for about 6 - 8 months and claims to have recently purchased

$500 worth of i1-2 carbine parts from FORREST for the purpose

of making short M-2 "enforcers".

According to what DAVIS has been saying, FORREST

appears to have contacts with military personnel at Camp

Penâleton through which he makes weekly raids on armories

and the supplies there.

DAVIS has apparently asked BARRY

GODFREY to go with him to Camp Pendleton to show him the

location of the scrap parts pile of the ordnance disposal

unit on that base.

DAVIS continues to talk about and work on the Right

Wing organization he wants to establish.

His idea is to

contact people he knows in Phoenix, Seattle, Portland, and

Las Vegas and have individuals in all those

cities give out

a press release announcing the formation of the new organization.

NW 55009 DocId: 32989524

## Page 1272

In addition, leaflets and stickers will be put out the same

day and post office boxes for the organization retned in all

these cities on the same day so as to completely disguise the

location of the national headquarters which will be in San

Diego, with DAVIS and GODFREY running the thing. He wants

to structure the organization along military lines with

military ranks and training for the purpose of creating a

Right wing organization to overthrow the government in this

çountry.

I was told by Barry Godfrey that he and George

Hoover went by Peace House il at 2143 Market Street Last

night. Godfrey said the place appeared to be unoccupiec

at the time and when he and Hoover looked inside, saw it

to be tull of books and other literature, and all kinds

of materials.

They also claimed to have driven by the

house at 3121 Beech which Godfrey said is a big house at

the corner of the street.

Jezry lee Bustre walt stated that Hoover, an Spath, and

Nazi Party group last night. Hoover was wearing the uniform

of the new group he is trying to organize.

This organization

will be a branch of the Missionary Church of Jesus Christ

headed by Reverend Gale at Los Angeles, California.

While at the meeting, because of some internal

trouble, and because they liked Hoover's uniform better

than the Nazi uniform, most of Smith's group decided to

leave the Nazi Party organization and join Hoover's new

I don't know anything about a Reverend Pike or

Peak, but the Reverend Gale may be the same one who is head

0f Missionary Church of Jesus Christ at Los Angeles.. Gale

comes to town about once a month to fulfill a speaking

assignment here. He has Nazi and anti-Semitic tendencies

although he is not known to me as being a member of the

Nazy Party.

Also, I have heard nothing about threatening

telephone calls being made by anyone locally to obtain the

release of the Patriotic Party members in Michigan; however,

Margaret L. McNichols, who Lives at 2113 Whispering Pines

Drive in Julian, is closely acquainted

with the individuals

in Michigan named Freed.

At one time, she told me she

and Freed both belonged to some German club and showed me a

photograph of her and Freed together. at a meeting in Santa

I was talking with BARRY GODFREY last night. He

said he had just spent sometime with SAM DAVIS the same

evering and that DAVIS admitted to being a total anarchist.

He said that DAVIS thinks that the U.s. government is as

much an enemy of the people, meaning right wing conservatives

as the left wing movemen't is. He said DAVIS is still interested

in attempting to formulate a new organization to take the

place of the old Minuteman Group. BARRY said DAVIS wants

to set up a right wing groups, one, an open group which

would conduct intelligence type operations and the other a

covert group which would conduct sabotage and harassment.

and obtain such things as explosives and machine: guns.

GODFREY said the conversation with DAVIS got

around to TROY HOUGHTON and DAVIS said he has known for

two years what actually happened to HOUGHTON and added that

BETTY HOUGHTON has also had the same Information. According

to DAVIS, a meeting was held at which BETTY HOUGHTON, DAVIS,

PAUL HUNT, DENNIS MOWER, GEORGE HOOVER, and one other unidentified

individual were present. The meeting was held for the purpose

of hearing an oral report from MARy TOLLERTON as to what had

happened to TROY HOUGHTON, that he had been held prisoner by

ROBERT DE PUGH In the basement of DE PUGH's house with the help

Of WALTER PEYSON.

HOUGHTON was then poisoned to death and his

body disposed of somewhere in the State of Missouri. After

the meeting, BETTY HOUGHTON was in favor of making all this

information public and requesting a grand jury investigation

Of DE PUGH and PEYSON for her husband's death.. However, the

other people present at the meeting talked her out of this

close of action.

GODFREY then said DAVIS told him that he knows of a

total of five people who were killed by DE PUGH, including

TROY HOUGHTON. He said two of these were killed after

HOUGHTON's death to keep his murder quiet. DAVIS said that

MARY IOLIERTON was being hidden in the Los Angeles area for

quite a while by DENVIS MOWER, PAUL HUNT and others as there

was thought DE PUGH was looking for her to kill her.

Some row,

she got away from MOWER and HUNI for a period of about six months

but then they got her back again. Allegedly, BETTY HOUGHTON

told MOWER to keep track of MARY TOLLERTON at all cost even

If he had to marry her.

According to DAVIS, It is his belief HOUGHTON was

killed by DE PUGH as DE PUGH thought. HOUGHTON had already

contacted the FBI or was in the process of arranging such a

contact for the purpose of Informing on DE PUGH's activities:

This morning, I met an individual named RON ZARICK

who was attempting to sell military ammunitions of several

calibers. I will try to find out more about him later.

I also loarred that there were 12 members of the

NSWPP at the anti-war demonstration at NEI Center yesterday.

SAM DAVIS may also have been there as he appeared to know

..a lot about it. DAVIS has had a project going to get himself

fired from his job and may already have been successful. If

so, he will go on unemployment and then on welfare in order

to be able to devote full time to his right wing activities.

He has approached me about going to a meeting at Los Angeles

in the next few days with representatives of the Minutemen

organization, the States Right Party, and the NSWPP for

the purpose of discussing the possibility of an alliance of these

groups. He mentioned that the national leader of the States

Rights Party may be at the meeting. I will try to find out

more about this also.

I also learned that DAVIS wants to set up a course

of instruction in the use of explosives which would start

off with a group composed of BARRY GODFREY and two men selected

by him and SAM DAVIS and two men selected by him.

JUNE 23, 1971

BY JEROME

I was in conversation with PAUL RUPLINGER and

General LEMLEY yesterday.. LEMLEY said he has some M-16

rifles and has been giving weapons to all of his neighbors

for self defense.

LEMLEY is extremely militant and I understand

that:he, RULINGER, and perhaps SAM DAVIS refused to f11l

out the U.s. Census Forms which they received and expected to

be arrested shortly and placed in jail.

LEMLEY says that lots of weapons and other items of

military equipment are coming down to the U.S. out of Canada.

LEMLEY was extremely upset at the arrests made by ATFD and

local law enforcement officers at the Pasadena Gun Show on

6/19/71. He said he was going to contact the headquarters of

the John Birch Society (which he is deeply involved in) at

San Marino, and have that organization check into the arrests.

PAUL RUPLINGER was also very upset about the situation.

It should be noted that in talking with RON ZARICK

before the gun show took place, he warned me to be cautious

at the gun show. as he had received word that the ATFD and

State officials were planning to make arrests at the show.

It has come to my attention that both SAM DAVIS

and BARRY GODFREY are fairly well acquainted with SCOTT

WINCHESTER, leader of the Nazi Party Group, Bishop Faction,

at Los Angeles, California.

WINCHESTER appears to be a near kook. He was one

of the more active participants in the anti-war demonstration

sponsored by MDM at Oceanside, California, in May, 1970. He

was running around like a roving idiot and screaming, "fascist

pigs" at the police.

SAM DAVIS says he heard that the NSWiP at San

Diego might favor a spiit from the NSWPP at Los Angeles

REPORT BY JEROME

Coach Wh SAM DAVE the coming.

and while I was at his house his boss called saying that

he had some important jobs for DAVIS to take care of. He

said II DAVIS coula not be more reliable, he, the boss,

would have to find someone else to do the job. DAVIS

then told him to go ahead and find someone else whereupon

his boss hung up.

DAVIS said he has another job to go

to in the middle of next week for one ROGER (LNU).

job will last approximately one month following which

DAVIS will be laid off and then can claim unemployment

and welfare while devoting full time to his activities.

He believes he can draw unemployment for a period of

approximately six months. He talked again

about the explo-

sives and other materials which he has and some of which he

has given to me.

He said he has come across opportunities to buy

buy these other materials and also to help the Nazi Party

out financially.

DAVIS stated that it is his intention to join .

the American Nazi Party and showed me his membership

application form.

It is my understanding that the local Nazi

group which has,

in the past, been part of the Mational Socialist

White Peoples Party (NSVPP), will switch allegiance in the

near future to the Bishop Faction of the American Nazi

Party now headed up by SCOTT WINCHESTER at Los Angeles,

California.

If and when this takes place, the name they

apparently will use for the new group is American Socialist

Workers Party.

DAVIS is all excited about buying uniforms

and other things to get ready to go on "storm trooper"

He said he is going to try and get all of his

associates,

including GEORGE HOOVER, STAN MC DADE, JAMES

POTO, BARRY GODFREY, ROGER WILLIS and "AL" (LNU) to join

also.

## Page 1289

According to DAVIS, the Nazi Party group which he

has been hearing so much about lately is only a segment of

the total Nazi group in the San Diego area.

GERALD I. I.

smolt, the leader of this active group, is apparently only

what is caled a section leader.

There are apparently

several sections of the Nazi Party group in San Diego

and overall leader for the whole group.

DAVIS said that he and three other people,

of whom will probably be STAN MC DADE and the other

members of the NSVPP in San Diego, will go to Los Angeles

soon to see SCOTT WINCHESTER and make arrangements for

merging with his group.

DAVIS says that the Nazi Party group is good

on organizing but poor on weapons acquisition and intelligence

work.

He said he expects to be of considerable help to the

Nazis in these two areas.

He said

he has been in contact with BARRY GODFREY

and had asked him to do some work on compiling a list of

liberal members of the Jewish community in San Diego as

a starting point for harassment and other tactics by the

Nazis.

He said that the Nazis have been using DON SISCO'S

Militants Formulary as a handbook for training.in explosives

He said SISCO himself is reported to be a section

leader for either the Bishop Faction of the Nazi Party. or

the NSWPP.

DAVIS: telephone number is listed in the directory

under B. I. GIBSON at 2393 Washington, Lemon Grove, California.

The telephone number is 465-9572.

DAVIS indicated that he has been offered 100

grenade bodies with the necessary parts to make live

weapons

from them for a sum of $25.00.

This morning I observed all the parts of a dis-

assembled •30 caliber Browning air-cooled machine gun in

the back room of the Bullseye Gun Shop.

SAM DAVIS says he has an operation in mind for

this weekend. He said he wants BARRY GODFREY to provide

six men; DAVIS will provide another six and the NSWPP will

furnish 12 men to conduct a raid on a faculty office at UCSD,

where a Viet Cong Flag is supposed to be hanging. The pur

pose of the raid will be to seize the flags take It out on

the campus, and burn it in front of as large a crowd as they

can get.

DAVIS said he is also trying to get ahola of a.

white phosphorous grenade for another project he has in

mind for the weekend, but would not even hint as to what

he is thinking of using it for.

I went to a recent meeting of the NSWPP with

STAN MC DADE. GERALD I. SMITH was speaking. One of the other

people at the meeting had a medal for what is referred tọ

. by the American Nazi Party as the "Virginia Campaign", which

occurred in 1958. These medals were awarded by GEORGE LINCOLN

ROCKWELL, which would indicate that the person I saw at the

meeting must be a longtime Nazi Party member. This individual

said he is going to Los Angeles soon with MC DADE and

It appears that PETER RUPLINGER has a friend

in a small arms arsenal or depot on one of the local

Navy Bases. He has been offering the sale of four M-2

conversion kits, and says he thinks he will be able to

furnish all the small arms including grenades and possibly

& light .30 caliber machine gun that anyone would want.

He was asking BARY GODFREY if GODFREY could obtain a tear

gas grenade which RUPLINGER wants for the purpose of throw

ing into the "Bedroom",

a local night club offering nude

entertainment.

I saw TOM FORREST yesterday and while there

observed a .45 caliber grease gun with two full nagazines.

Some time ago I met a person named DICK GOULD.

Yesterday I saw him again and he offered me a sawed off

shotgun and another shotgun. which had been made into a

pistol. He wanted $50 for both of the weapons but did not

have them with him for me to look at. I will try to find

out more about GOULD.

what a nut and raving maniac he is. He apparently has moved

to Poway. Iêsterday while I was at Bulls Eye Gun Shop

BILL GUIETTE was telling me about some work he was doing

on a nine millimeter German Schmeitzer. Today I was in

Bulls Eyes again and met this LARRY BROWN and talked to

him for about one hour. He was telling me all about his

nine millimeter German Schmeitzer and hinted that he may

have some other automatic weapons. Very likely the Schmeitzer

GUIETTE was working on belonged to BROWN. I will also

It has come to my attention that there is

an individual who may be of interest who works for the San

Diego Fire Department and is assigned to Station 13 in La

Jolla. His name Is RICK BURNS and he has been overheard

to make statements which are highly pro-Rusian and pro-Com

munist China. He saves up his money and vacation time and

travels to Russia each summer.

BURNS apparently lives in the La Jolla area as he

walks to work every morning. He is about 27, 5'11", 180

husky build. He has light brown hair, a ruddy complexion,

wears reading glasses, is married and has a collie dog. He

allegedly served in the U.S. Marine Corps and has been with

the Fire Department for about four and one half years.

REPORT BY JEROME

Yesterday I was in contact with PETER RUPLINGER.

He is still self employed

as a wholesale diamond dealer.

He

said one of his customers is allegedly an Italian who has

connections with the local tuna fishing association and with

the Mafia. He said he had acquired from this person a

rifle with a silencer which he told RUPLINGER was

a Mafia

assassination

weapon.

He obtained this rifle from RUPLINGER

yesterday evening for $20.00.

The rifle is a British

Enfield bolt action

rifle and a .303 caliber. It has beer

heavily modified with an

extension having been added to the

butt stock and the parts of the receiver assembly missing

exposing the internal working mechanism. The rear sight

is. also missing.

The breech ends of the receiver and barrel on this

rifle are usually threaded with a square cut thread. However

on this rifle,

these parts both have a regular toothed

machine thread which was obviasly done to allow the tille

to be disassembled into two pieces.

The forestock of the rifle is also missing and

a device, reported to be a silencer,

has been added to the

breech end of the barrel. This device is approximately

2" in diameter and 5" long and cylindrical in shape.

There is a ¿" diameter aluminum tube extending from the

forward bottom part of this device along the barrel almost

to the muzzle. . Attached to the muzzle is the regular issue

British flash suppressor for use on the Enfield •303 caliber

carbine.

Most of the metal parts of the rifle have been

coated with black lacquer.

When

assembled, the rifle does not headspace

properly which is apparently due to the threads being worn

ôr a necessary shim missing.

I recontacted RUPLINGER this morning and learned

that the individual he obtained the rifle from is one..

PHILLIP SALUATO, 6766 RoSe Field Drive, san Diego,

California.

RUPLINGER said SALUATO allegedly has

other

weapons including Thompson submachine guns and M-2 carbines

which he will sell. RUPLINGER also said that the silenced

NW 55009 DocId: 32989524

Page

•1300

---

## Page 1301

rifle which he sold me was supposedly delivered to SALUATO

by the Mafia for destruction or permanent disposal. He

siad SALUATO, who is apparently eager to make a fast buck,

apparently decided to sell the weapon rather than destroy it.

From my knowledge of RUPLINGER, I suspect it is

very likely he enlarged considerably on this story.

high position In this organization. He says that VIC WALION

Is deeply involved in the NSWPP, but even though, he still

does not trust WALTON. He said he is going ahead with plans

to locate and rent office space for the NSWPP and also set

up a printing press for that group.

DAVIS also talked about another plan which is

being worked on to attempt to seize a Viet Cong flag which is

hanging In an office at UCSD. He said at least he would like

:..

to make an effort to put a smoke grenade through the

window of this office. He said he has been talking with

the NSWPP about taking 15 members of that group along

to protect the person who would fire this rifle grenade

through the window. He sald the results would be better

yet if a high explosive grenade was used. He advised that

the NSWPP and others he is assoclated with are suppose to

have some LAWs (ight Anti-tank Weapons) which they might

use.

FRANK YACOPEC has been fired again. He now

has a boarder llving with him who was recently discharged

Irom the Marine Corps. This individual is named ROBERT S.

MAYER. He claims to be well acquainted with the firearm

ranges at Camp Pendleton and knows of an ammo. dump there

which he says has only one guard who could easily be

over-powered, and that, by using a two ton truck, It would

be possible to. take over a million rounds of ammo from this

location. MAYER also claims to have a .45 callber Thompson

sub-machine gun, and M-16 and M-14 rifles which he would

sell..

BILL GUIETTE, who runs the Bullseye Gun Store was

set up in that business by his father who is a Sergeant with

the San Diego Pollce Department, GUIETTE was telling

¡today that he was at RON ZARICK's house a few days ago and

saw there many parts for varlous machine guns. Yesterday

DAVIS claims that he is somewhat upset with

BARRY GODFREY, as he gave GODFREY an assignment to watch

JEROME

Soptember 9, 1971

In talking with BARRY GODFREY, I Learned

of the formation of a new organization mown as

the National Justico Foundation. This organization

is supposed to be a group of lawyers from the Los

Angeles and Sacramento areas whose purpose will be

to counteract the work of the ACLU.

I also learned that the groups which are

protesting the sailing of the USS Constellation

aro going to set up polling booths outside various

city polling places and at other locations in an

attenpt to get people to vote on whether the USS

Constellation should sail.

I also was told that the Bishop faction

of the Nazi Party is now known as the National

Socialist American Workers Partys

and is putting

out a new newspaper named "Attack". Apparently,

this newspaper is being published and printed at

Los angeles, california.

GODFREY also told me he was recently

interviewed by a San Diego County Deputy Sheriff

named D. Q. MARTIN, regarding GODFREY's involvement

in Minuteman and other right wing activities.

MARTIN was apparently under the impression that

GODFREY was one of the leaders of these activities

and would be able to furnish much informatiun as to

names, addresses, and activities of other people who

are involved. GODFREY denied any knowledge whatsoever

of such activities which caused MARTIN to become

extremely aggrivated and to make some veiled threats

against GODFREY. However, he eventually gave up and

lert.

Afterward, GODFREY

discussed this matter with

SAM

DAVIS, MICK HOOVER, and a few other people.

It

was their feeling that MARTIN's visit to GODFREY was

probably caused by BILL CLAY. CLAY has suddenly been

ground contacting people, asking questions and trying

to find out what is going on. CLAy even made a

personal appearance at the Gunsmoke Ranch and, while

there, apparently caused some friction as HOOVER has

nor been asked to leave the ranch. Ihe questions In •

of infornation for MARrIN rogarding GODFREY's

It soems that DAVIS, HOOVER, anD STAN

as thoy formerly were. However, they will continue

to cooperate with that group.

very onthusiastic about the coning Republican National

Convention. He thinks that this will be his big

chance to do sonothing that will be remembered in the

world. he said he is working on plons to organize

September 13, 1971

I was in contact with SAM DAVIS this

morning.

He told me that he has joined the Naz1

Party and that today he rented Post Office BOx

5791, San Diego, Caliiornia, for the Nazis.

He said he has been assignod to act as a storm

Trooper

group leader in the San Diego area and has

begun actively organizing for the Nazis.

He explained that he went to see SCOTt

WINCHESTER at Torrance, California, yesterday.

He said he not WINCHESTER at a place named The

Bavarian Alpine Village where WINCHESTER's group

has relocated. He said that the activities of

WINCHESTER's group are very open and that there was

a lot of Nazi Ilterature and posters in plain view.

He said he observed many people giving the Nazi •

salute and handing SCOTT WINCHESTER mOneY.

• DAVIS said there were several thousand

people present at The Bavarian Alpine Village with

hundreds of them dancing around outside the Nazi

Party headquarters.

He said the crowd included .

many Llthuanians, Estonians, and Arabs, as well as

Germans, most of whom appears to be pro- Nazi. DAVIS

said one Arab was introduced to him as the leader

of the At satah Group at Los Angeles. He said that

another person who was introduced to him claimed to have

worked for the HIlLER Youth SS and was wearing a gold

Ss ring. DAVIS himself is now wearing a silver sS ring.

I also Learned that GERALD I, SMITH and one

of his Ileutenants went into the "Peace House" at

2143 Market Street, early last Friday afternoon to get

some of their literature.

They were dressed in full

Nazi uniform and when they went Into the house, they

found a meeting of about tilty persons in progress. :

NW 55009 DOCIAT32389524 Page-1312

## Page 1313

Their appearance in Nazi uniforms caused a groat doal

of consternation among those people at the meeting..

Also, It has come to my attention that.

SAM and his associates have been asked to set up

a printing press for the Nazis in Vic Walton's

guest house and have taken this request under

favorable consideration.

GERALD I SMITH local Nazi Party Group,

the National Soclalist White People's Party, 1s

affiliated with the same group at los Angeles which

18 FUn by JOE TOMASSI. DAVIS, however, favors

the Nazi. Party Group run by SCOTT WINCHESTER at

Los Angeles, and is working with SIAN MC DADE tO

engineer a switch of SMItH's group from the TOMASSI.

group to che WINCHESTER group.

DAVIS said that

MC DADE and SMITH are on vory

friendly terms.

The Right Wing Activists In the San Diego

area have three printing presses.

One, which belongs

tO BETTIE HAUGHION, Is located at the residence of

WALT and EDITH CEYER on Massachusetts Avenue in La Mesa.

Another, which 1s owned by BIll GLAY, Is located at

the residence of HOWARD CLARK at Ramona, Californias

and the third, which belongs to ED BOYD, TROY HAUGHTON's

step-father, is in the possession of STAN MC DADE.

He said he wants to try and have the

application forms and some of the training materials

printed this weekend.

He also said he will get a new

San Diego post office box tomorrow.

There will be

two membership lists maintained which will be

recorded on microfilm so they will be easy to hide.

One of these lists will be kept by DAVIS and the

other will be hold by BARRY GODFREY. There will be

monthly literature mailouts with DAVIS and GODFREY

responsible for the maliouts on alternate months..

However, the mailouts will be made from GoDFREY's

The supplies for the mallouts and other

SAM said that BETTIE HAUGHTON has a large

quantity of training Ilterature and other supplies

in her possession which he will attempt to obtain

from her. He said that ALEX (INU) of Alex Rapid

Print has agreed to donate a part of the printing

costs for this literature.

In addition, DAVIS said that when the

Septomber 28, 1971

Early this mornings I was contacted by

SAM DAVIS who was looking for somoone to help him

with a project.

I told him I had other commitments

for the day and he said he would try to find someone

else to help him.

Later on, I talked to hin again

and he told me ho had wanted someone to help him to

move several hundred pounds of explosives from the

residenco of one ROGER (LNU) at 2003 Dartmoor 1n

spring

valleys California.

DAVIS claimed that those

explosives included INT, Co4 Plastic Explosives,

and rifle grenades. DAVIS would not even hint as to

where these explosives had been moved but did make a

statement to the

affect "some day we'll have to move

the master cache". I got the impression that HOWARD

CLARK may have been involved in this project. I

understand that the individual named ROGER. Lived

with a Mexican woman and several children at that

address.

I have never heard of this ROGER before

but will try to find out more.

October 8, 1971

It has come to my attention that the

individual I told you about previously named

RICK BURNS, who is a fireman at San Diego Fire

Department

Station Number 13 in La Jolla,

continues to make extremely sympathetic statements

about communism in Russia and China.

In addition,

while at work, he always has a copy of the "Door"

or the "Street Journal"

" with him.

I was also

told that he was observed writing the name of

Dr. GEORGE ABBOTT and telephone number 488-4421

and. the name HERBERT GINDLER on the wall at the

fire station near the telephone.

I was in contact with STAN MC DADE earlier

today. He said he has had one thousand copies ai

the new membership application form for the secret

Army Organization printed up as well as a large number

of copies of lotterhead stationery for the group.

"The membership initiation fees to join the organization

will be $5 and there will be a $3 per month dues

assossed for each member.

MC DADE said he believes

he will join the organization.

I learned that GEORGE HOOVER, who is out of

work, is now receiving unemployment payments. He also

allegedly been on some of the local reservations

attempting to recruit Indians to help work in

opposition to the Leftists.

I also found out that SAM DAVIS, HOOVER

and JERRY BUSCH have been talking about committing

robberlos of houses of prostitution and similar

establishments where there would be little 11kllhood

of the theit boing raported.

The purpose of these

robberies, of course, is to obtain money to finance

right wing activities.

REPORT BY JEROME

•October 20, 1971

• : •

of the Secret Army Organization (SAO) • This letterhead was

printed approximately two weeks ago along with a large

number of sheets which are information bulletins and a so-called

history of the organization.

Some stickers advertising for

support of the SAO were printed about one week later.

A11

of the printing has been done on BETTY HAUGHTON's Offset

press either by her or by wAit GuyeR.

In line with the decision to go ahead and set up the

SAO organization, SAM DAVIS and BARRY GODFREY have been out

contacting

people in an attempt to get new recruits.

So fars.

• FRANK YACOPEC,

PAUL RUFLINGER, ROBERT MATER

and JAVES EVAN POIC have been approached and appear to de,

Est onably disposed to joining the new organization. Iwo

other individuals, GEORGE HOOVER and JERRY LEE BUSCH

apparently are not to know about the organization for the

time being. However, they have been asked to do some

intelligence-type investigations and reports on some random

Left Wing activities which are involved in the project to

attempt to keep the USS Constellation from sailing on 11/1/71.

they have turned in one report, which gather was

so nihull done, typed and dealt with the layout of the builaing

Involved, its occupants, the police coverage, and other areas

of interest.

HOOVER and

BUSCH are supposed to be busy at

the present

time on a similar report on another groups.

SAO who have not yet been officially contacted.

As previously reported, SAM DAVIS and GEORGE

HOOVER and STAN MC DADE were very much interested in joining

the local Nazi group, the National Socialist White Peoples

Party (NSWP). However, they recently aiscovered that the

official Nazi

Party policy is very much anti-American Indiar

and they are now very disenchanted with the Nazis

as DAVIS is

one-quarter Indian and HOOVER is one-half Indian. In addition,:

this policy has cost

Lieutenants (name not known). This person was Living with

a gift who is part Indian and when SMITH ordered him to

stop seeing her, he left the organization instead. It is

possible that he may join the SAO.

This interesting turn of events may have been

one the important factors which caused DAVIS to try and get

the SAl off the ground.

Many of the SAO organizational histories and news

bulletin sheets have been sent out and are being sent out to

other people who have been known in the past to be Right

Wing sympathizers®

and others.

Everett

CY ANDERSON, from someplace in the seatle,

Washington, area, as well as HARD MOORE and his wife,

who are identified as Miami leaders in the Phoenix,

Arizona, area, were also in attendance.

In addition, the Angriff Press (DON SISCO'S grOUD)

was well represented and had set up a table on which were being

sold all kinds of manuals and literature on explosives and

incendiries.

They were also selling blasting cap crimpers

and American

Nazi Party Christmas cards.

The people sponsoring the gun show expected only

about 200 individuals to show up.

However, there were 200

Gables set up

on many of which two persons were displaying

their merchandise, plus many spectators for a total of at

least 500 individuals at the show.

Included among these

were many Yuma County Sheriffs and city police officers

who were taking an active part in the show.

I belleve some

ATFD Agents showed up at the show but were afraid to make any

arrests or take any other action due to the large numbers of

people at the show and the obvious lack of support they were

getting from the local law enforcement officers. I honestly

believe there would have been a big shootout if the ATFI

Agents had atteupted to take any kind of action such as make

an arrest or seize some piece of merchandise.

Mostof the

people at the show seemed to be in a very bad mood toward

the ATFD.

--

One of the hottest itens at the show was

50 caliber

machine gun ammunition.

BILL GUIETTE took a large quartity

of this ammunition to sell and got rid of all of it.

There was

a Pro-nationalist Chinese individual there, who was well known

to CY ANDERSON, who was buying all the .50 caliber ammunition

and magazines and parts he could get.

I was told that he is

supposed to be filthy rich and to have a stupendous arsenal

located on his ranch somewhere in Southern Arizona.

Everti

Following the gun show,

a meeting involving 573

MOORE, CY ANDERSON, SAI DAVIS, MC DADE and GODFREY was held

to discuss the SAO. The news

the SAO were passed around and MOORE and ANDERSON agreed that

their respective groups would join in with the SAO as they

felt that some cohesion among Right Wing groups has become

necessary due to the power vacuum left by. the Minuteman

organization.

After the show, SAM DAVIS drove to Las Vegas,

Nevada to contact some people there, among them a persor

named JACK DOYLE who is supposed to have Mafia connections,

to determine if they were interested in the SAO and,if so,

what sapport or assistance they can give.

in route to the gun show, CY ANDERSON broke down

somewhere in Nevada and he had been forced to hire san eone

to bring him on

to the gun show.

After the show,

he rode

backs to the location of his automobile with SAM DAVIS.

ANDERSON brought with.

him to the gun show a

number of U.S. Navy survival kits, some Army sleeping bags,

an AR 180 rifle in a .223 caliber and some miscellaneous gun

parts for the KARNES of AR

sales at Los Angeles, California,

who were also at the show. ANDERSON appeared to be good

friends of the KARNES.

While at the gun show, ANDERSON was overheard to state

that his group had recently lost 5,000 feet of primacord and

10 machine guns in a raid by the ATFD on a friend's house.

ANDERSON said he was not too concerned about the machine

guns but he really hated to lose all of that Primacord.

It was learned that ANDERSON supposedly has a blaster's

permit with which he can obtain most of the comercially

available explosives that he wants. ANDERSON said he was

going to stay in the sainwest party of the country for about

two weeks to make contact with people he knows.

He said the

last week of this two-week period would be spent in San Diego

helping to get the sAo started.

In addition, he indicated he probably would return

to the San Diego area

in about two months at which time he

would bring more weapons to sell.

SAM DAVIS called Last Saturday night to

tell me he had finally roturned to San Diego.

He said he got more involved at Las Vegas In

organizing and contacting people than he had

expected to.

It looks as though some of the

people he met at Las Vegas will be joining the

SAO group.

This morning, we are supposed to go

to all of the post office boxes and see if there

has been any response to the mailing out of the

first literature on the SAO. We also are going

to order insignia patches to be sewn on the berets

that SAO members will wear. These patches will be

obtained through CY ANDERSON at Seatcle, Washington.

SAM also wants to start work on organizing some

urban Guerilla warfaro squads.

He said he wants

so form these squads with six men to a squad. and

two cars to a squad.

I also learned

from him that there will be

for recent actions taken by the United Nations

with rogard to Nationalist China. He said some

of the things that have been considered are

this incident from the White Power rally which will

tako place the previous day HOOVER was also talking

about trying to get some members of the Chinese-American

Association down to help.

HOOVER and STAN MC DADE are presently on

• a religious organization kick and are associated with

the Missionary Church of Jesus Christ run by Reverend

GALE at Los Angeles.

They have acquired some fancy

blue uniforms to go along with their involvement. in

this group. I understand that SAM DAVIS and BARRY

The individuals with whom SAM DAVIS was in

contact at Las Vegas are JACK DOYLE, telephone number

I was in contact with RON ZARICK earlier

today.

He claimed that he had some explosives

he wanted to sell and askod if I was interested.

• I also understand that there ware some spies,

probably GEORGE HOOVER and JERRY BUSCH, watching

ROD BURTON's house at 1511 29th Street, yesterday.

Apparently, some kind of meeting was taking place

there and one man had been stationed out front as

a watchman.

Automobilesknown to belong to MELVIN

CRAIN and LEON NOWER were observed parked at the

residence.

A person I have mentioned before, CY

ANDERSON, W111 be at SAM DAVIS' house tomorrow.

It is my understanding that ANDERSON was originally

introduced to DAVIS by TRoy HAuGhION.

Furchermore,

I was told that SAM DAVIS met TOM FORREST through

CY ANDERSON. It looks as though ANDERSON may be

one of the biggest right wing operators and dealers

In firearms in the west.

The trip which ANDERSON

made to Texas actually took him to El Paso. He

apparently made contact there wit several individuals

whose identities are known to DAVIS but who would not

divulge them to me.

November 4, 1971

I have Learned from GEORGE HOOVER, STAN

MC DADE, and JERRY BUSCH attended a meeting of

GERALD I. SMITH'S Nazi Group last night.

As I

mentioned before, HOOVER has become involved in

the activities of a semi-religious group named

The Missionary Church of Jesus Christ.

This group

Ls run by a Reverend GALE at Los Angeles, California.

GALE claims to be a rotired Colonel and a former aid

to General MC ARTHUR. GALE comes from Los Angeles

to San Diego to speak approximately once a month.

He is very anti-semitic and has Nazi tendencies

although I doubt he belongs to any Nazi organization.

HOOVER is in the process of trying to get himself

ordained as a minister of this church.

Ho has made

hinself up a fancy blue uniform which he wore to the

Nazi Party meeting and, apparently, so impressed

the other members of the group at the meeting, that

many of them wanted to join HOOVER's group, as he

had a better uniform than the Nazi uniform.

apparently caused SMITH a great deal of consternation

and he is now busily trying to re organize his group.

I went by. the "Peace House" last night and

took a pook through the windows.

No one seemed to be

home and I observed the house to be stacked full of

Literature and other printed materials.

November 9, 1971

The SAO has roceived its first responso

from the mailouts which were made in October.

This came from an individual named CHARLES MANLEVE,

2938 North Seventeen Drive, Phoenix, Arizona, 85015.

HANLEVE wrote his letter about two weeks ago expressing

interest in the SAO and requesting more information

about 1%.

Incidentally, we are about to lose BILl.

CLAY's old post office box at the Grossmont Post

Office Station. The building where the station is

located is to ba torn down and the post office boxes

are to be vacated by the 25th of this month. It would

be helpful to obtain another post office box somewhere

else in CLAY's name to facilitate the forwarding of

mails.

In talking with STAN. MC DADE, I have learned

that MICKEY BURTON WAKEFIELD is no longer associated

with SMITH's Nazi group.

WAKEFIELD is oither married

to or has been living with a Mexican girl. . The

official Nazi Party policy is that people with American

Indian blood,

Including Mexicans, are an inferior race

and therefore Nazi Party members should have nothing

to do with them.

I understand that WAKEFIELD was ordered

to dump the girl he was living with because of this

policy, but refused to do so.

consequently, he either

quit or was thrown out of the Nazi Party by. SMITH.

MC DADE claimed that this samo attitude on the

part of the Nazis toward people with Indian blood as

well as some other things which have happened has cost

SMITH most of the membership of his group.

MC DADE

said that many of the Nazi Party members had Mexican

wives or girlfriends and that SMITH has been telling

the members to get rid of them which has created

hard

feelings.

I was also talking with FRANK YACOPEC and

from him learned that his friend, ROBERT MAYER, 1s

quite knowledgeable about radio communications. MAYER

has been investigating the broadcasting set up of radio

NW 55009 DocId: 32989524 Page 1342

---

## Page 1343

station KSON. Apparently this station has its

broadcast antenna located at some distance from the

radio station itself.

It has a repeater and

amplifier arrangement at the antenna to pick up,

amplify, and ra-broadcast the relatively weak

signal which comes from the radio station. Because

of this set up, MAYER claims that with the proper

nam radio equipment in a truck or car, most of which

he already has, it would be possible for a right wing

group to drive this vehicle in the vicinity of SON's

broadcast antenna, jam the signal from the base

station, and put out its own fifteen minutes propaganda

tape using KSON's broadcast antenna. YACOPEC and

MAYER said they are going to work at setting up the

/ necessary: equipment to do this.

I have also been talking with SAM DAVIS.

He told me. that he and CY ANDERSON have made

tentative plans for a trip which will start about

December 1, 1971.

ANDERSON will meet in San Diego and from there go to

• Phoenix, Arizona, where they will leave SAM's car.

They will then go on to Juarez and Mexico City,

Noxico. After returning from Mexico, they will then

travel to Denver, Colorado, and also to places in the

state of Montana, with the

fellow from Iss Vegas,

Nevada, named ED (LNU).

The whole trip is to take

two or three weeks and will be made for the purpose

of making contacts in the various cities visited with

people who are known to them as Right Wing Extremists

JEROME

Novembor 10, 1971

STAN MC DADE is a very miserable and

bitter individual. He has a strongly anti-semitic

attitude, and blames the U.S. Government and

Jewish business poople for him being out of work

and scraping bottom.

lost all of his friends because of his association

with the Nazi Party.

MC DADE 1s a former merchant ship captain

and still holds his masters papors.

At one time he

also had a large boat and a good boat yard too, but :

blames Jewish bankers for the loss of these and

also for the fact that he cannot got a new business

going.

However, all he dreams about is going to

sea again and getting away from the life on shore.

He said he has been offered an eighteen-month. contract ..

to sall a ship but thinks he ought to stay home in

order to be able to shoot Jews.

He said he only stays

with his wife because of the children they have but

he does not care much for them either.

At one time, MC DADE supposedly was arrested

and convicted on a charge of illegal possession of a

machine gun. Allegedly, he received a presidential

pardon in this connection.

He said he thinks that the

right wing cause is hopelessly los and he is so miserable

in his life that he actually hopes for a confrontation

with the police or with the FBI so that he can end it

all in a big shoot out.

JEROME

November 22, 1971

I was talking to SAM DAVIS and BARRY GODFREY

at GODFREY's house last night. SAM was asking if we

knew where he could find a two and one half pound

block of C-4 plastic explosives, a one hundred foot

roll of fuse, and some fuse-type blasting caps.

said he wanted them for the night of November 22, 1971,

but did not say what for. Most likely, ho only wants

to sell them to someone.

He also askea GODFREy Ii he

could provide him with armed cover for the night of

November 22, 1971, beginning at about 7:00 p.m.

said he would have to work late as he is building a

Lence for the Balboa Fence Company at the Rincons

somewhere near Santa Barbara.

GODFREY hedged about

going along with DAVIS and said he did not know 1f he

could arrange it. DAVIS then said not to worry about

it as

he could easily get someone else.

Last Sunday, SAM DAVIS, ROGER DRAPEAU,

BARKY GODFREY, aRd STAN MC DADE and his two sons,

BREN'T and MARK, went out to the desert in DRAPEAU's

some of TROY HAUGHTON's caches of arms, ammunition

and other equipment.

The particular map that was used

Sunday, was hard to read; however, It is balieved that

the place marked on the map was actually located... The

story regarding this particular cache is that several

gears ago TROY HAUGHTON and some of his companions

went on a week long maneuver in the desert near the

Banner Grade east of Julian, California. During this

week of maneuvers, they supposedly built a cache of

weapons and ammunition on the side of a cliff near the

highway and made a map to show its location. On Sundays

we found a place where a beautiful hand laid rock wall

had been made against the side of a cliff within sight

of the Banner Grade Highway. We took the wall down and

dug back into the cliff a considerable distance but found.

nothing.

It is the intention of this group to check

this sito again at a later date with a metal detector.

According to DAVIS, MOSt Of TROY HAUGHTON'S

other caches of arms and ammunition as shown on the

other maps he has

are in the Needles and Rice,

California areas.

TEROME

November 26, 1971

I have been in contact with SAM DAVIS.

I learned from him that CY ANDERSON resides at

10418 Northeast 168th Place, Bothell, Washington,

and has telephone numbers 206-485-4854 and 206-454-8912.

His wife's name is DEE.

DAVIS Claims that he has already spent

$300 of his personal money on printing and materials

Ior the SAD. He said he is still thinking about

a trip to Phoenir, Arizona, Texas, and Mexico.

He also mentioned that JAMES EVAN POTO IS

getting ready to go to Illinois. He sald POTO is

wosking In San Diego for a nation wide chain of

restaurants and has been asked to go to Illinois to

start a new restaurant somewhere In that state.

I have also talked to FRANK YACOPEC, Who

said he is going to take a vacation trip to Chicago,

Illinois and vicinity in December.

He said he would

drop by Norborne, Missouri, where

the Minutemen

Headquarters was

Located, and put SAO stickers up

all over town.

He said he and ROBERT MAYER are working at

setting up a little citizens band radio network and

will try to provide mobile units to put in the cars

of various right wingers.

These mobile units will

probably be stolen.

He said they are also working

on a code to use and are still making plans on how to

take over radio station KSON's Broadcast Antenna in order

to play a

right wing propaganda tape.

the telephone company that the Message Information

Center was last located at 2225 A Street, San Diego.

However, their telephone at that location was

recently disconnected for non-payment.

The loss

of the telephone service is probably the reason for

Message Information Center going out of busiless.

The information regarding BILl CLAY's

Involvement in the Witches Coven on the University

of California at San Diego campus originally came

frOm SAM DAVIS and STAN MC DADE.

Ho has been in

The Witches Coven for over a year now and i believe:

he is still involved with 1t.

Apparently, his

main interest in this group is the

sexual proniscuity

of the women who are involved.

With regard to explosives, I have no personal

knowledge of any caches buried in the desert or elsewhere

on CLAY's part, although he did claim to have made

such caches.

I have seen him in possession of metal

cans or boxes full of dynamite and other explosives

which he claimed to have dug up from such a place.

& have also known him to be in possession of other

explosives and believe he still has the rented garage

which I, at one time, observed to be chuck full of

•30 caliber carbine ammunition. In adaition, SAM

DAVIS told me that at one time

he saw at least $500

worth of gold in CLAY's garage.

The current information on CLAY Is that he

is running around with FORREST (FROSTY) RODGERS.

RODGERS is the full-time west coast leader of the

JOHN BIRCH Society.

I was told that CLAY and RODGERS

do a lot of flying together.

BETTIE HAUGHTON 1S

doing all of the printing

for the SAo on her off set press which is now locatad

at WALT GUIRE's house.

She is also helping on

organizational work for the sAl and has provided

contact lists which may contain as many as 600 names

•of former contacts of TROY HAUGHTON.

Most of these

names, however, are probably just those appearing on

mailing lists rather than actual contacts.

In addition, BETTIE HAUGHTON still makes

frequent trips north to the place owned by HUGH LANCE

near Big Pine, California.

With regard to the 1972 Republican National

Convention, SAM DAVIS told me the other day that he

is busy setting up an alibi for him to use during

the convention.

His plan is to give the impression

of being out of town during the convention by driving

his car to Arizona and pretending to stay there with

EV MOORE. He will have MOORE cover for him as though

le were in Phoenix when actually he will fly back to

san Diego to commit various acts of harassments

etcetera, during the convention following which he

will fly back to Phoenix and then drive home.

Two Individuals named MICHAEL BROOKS and.

STEVEN O'NEIL have come to my attention. These persons

are, or were, running the sMe Organization at

Grossmont Junior College. However, BROOKS may now

be attending school at San Diego State College. BROOKS

and O'NEIl, supposedly are still residing together.

this information came from BROOKS' older brother.

December 20, 1971

BY JerOme

GEORGE HOOVER was at my house this morning and

• Left with me a sample of the metal which he alleges is

stolen government gold. He said he has come to the con-

clusion that the metal must be a gold-platinum alloy because

of the high melting temperature it has.

BARRY GODFREY told me that FRANK YACOPEC and ROBERT

MAYER went by the house at 3121 Beech Street in an attempt to

get at the printing press located there to destroy it.

Apparently, they were not able to accomplish anything there as

I have not heard of anything happening.

YACOPEC is now gone to Los Angeles, California, on

trip following which he will travel to Gary, Indiana, to

visit with his brother. He said he

will try to do some

recruiting for the SAo while there, and will put up SAo

stickers and leaflets wherever he can.

Friday I was at SAM DAVIS' house where I observed

a letter to DAVIS from JESSE CLAYBURN SIEVENS. at Silver Springs,

Maryland. In the letter, STEVENS talked of

• how he and his

group hated ROBERT DE PUGH and stated that he was in contact

with GLENN JACKSON and JOHN ZEMANEC of the American Volunteer

•NN-55009. Docid: 32989524 Page 1357

Group at Los Angeles. STEVENS, whO KnOWS SAM DAVIS only by

the name PATRICK MC DONALD, stated that he was anxious to

get in touch with right wing groups or Individuals in the

Southern California area. He advised he had received some

SAO literature but said he corresponds with several individuals

• In the san Diego area and did not know who had furnished him

With the SAO Ilterature. (Inis was SIAN NC DADE).

• . :

I also observed DAVIS' reply to STEVENS in which he

stated that the SAO was also interested in making contact with

SIrENs' group and other similar groups in the East. He said

that the SAO remains Minuteman at heart and in principle regardless

of the name or form it might take.

The SAO has had printed 200 copies of an information

sheet on PETER BOHMER; which is to be distributed to right-wing

activists and other individuals in the San Diego area. Ine

printing was done by ALEX (INU) at Alex Rapid Print House, and

the only charge was $3.50 for the materials. So far, SAO has

spent $140 on printing its literature, most of which has come

out of the pockets of DAVIS and GODFREY.. The stamps for this

SAO mail-out alone will cost $16.

ALEX of Alex Rapid Print is a former Minuteman who

allowed TROY HAUGHTON to do all of the West Coast Minuteman

print work on his equipment. He has now agreed to do all of the

SAO printing work at cost.

While I was at work the other day, a colored

individual cane in to report a leak in a water main. He

was driving an old pickup truck with california license

M30319 and was wearing a

chrome-plated Nazi helmet with an

American flag painted on it. I don't know what significance

this might have.

.. -==

With regard to the Nazis, I have learned that their

new headquarters is located at 7720 University in la Mesa and

is called the White Power Information Center.

•I also understand that the SAO may attempt to run a

poster campaign on Camp Pendleton as there are suppose to be a

1ot of good recruit possibilities there.

I was in contact with SAM DAVIS yesterday.

He told me that BETTIE HAUGHTON told him she has decided

to remarry soon, probably about June, 1972. DAVIS did

not tell me the name of the person she is to marry but

identified him as the neiv owner of the lodge at Big Pine

or Lone Pine, California, which formerly belonged to

HUGH LANCE. DAVIS said that apparently LANCE is now a.

Deputy Sheriff in Inyo County.

RON ZARICK told me yesterday that he has been

fired from the last job he had.

I do not know the person named ED CARVILLE who

received one of the SAO bulletins one PETER GEORGE BOHMER.

Apparently he was just on the membership list which the SAO

got from BETTIE.

BY JEROME

I received a telephone call last night from LYLE

MANNING at Richfield, Utah. He has telephone number 801-896-

5262, and gave me his address as Post Office Box 412, Richfield,

Utah. He told me he is now employed taking care of the fair

•grounds and race track at Richfield. MANNING claimed that he

and "DOC" ROBERTS are trying to form a right-wing activist

group at Richfield and asked me to send him all the Minuteman

literature that I could get for him. He also indicated

that he and ROBERTS will be visiting the San Diego area

about the middle of January, 1972. He said the purpose of

their trip will be to obtain all the .30-06 and .308 caliber

ammunition that they can find. He asked me to start looking

around for this ammunition for him.

I visited TOM FORREST's place last night and learned

that somehow he is obtaining a large number of the top halves

for M-16 rifle receivers. Apparently the only real difference

between the M-15 rifle, which is semi-automatic, and the M-16

• rifle, which is fully automatic, lies in be top half of the

receivers. He claims to have no trouble selling all these

items that he can get ahold of and he must have a good source

for suchweapon parts.

BARRY GODFREY told me that SAM DAVIS has received

more correspondence from JESSE CLAYBURN STEVENS From Silver

Springs, Maryland. In his letters STEVENS agreed to the

formation of an alliance between the SAO and his group.

According to the guidelines which were set up, STEVENS' group

will have control over right-wing activities in the east and

in the south while the SAO will control all activities in the

western and northern states. Both groups will work at trying

to find and establishing a coordinate at or near Chicago,

Illinois, to handle all activities in the mid-west area.

GODFREY said that a good possibility for this job would be

JIM POTO. He pointed out that POTO works for a national

restaurant chain, possibly Howard Johnson in San Diego, as

a restaurant manager. POTO has indicated that he expects to be

transferred in the near future to the Chicago area to open a

Rew restaurant and if so, he would make an ideal coordinator

for the mid-west group.

• In addition, arrangements were made in the letters

from STEVENS to trade information between the two groups on people

of interests to them who reside in each others areas.

In

other words, if the SA0 has information on a prospective

right-wing contact or other such person residing in the

area controlled by STIVENS' group, this information would be

sent to this group and vice versa.

NY- 55009-DoeFd: 32989524 Page_1365

## Page 1366

• Furthermore an agreement was made to transfer

members of the SAO and STEVENS' group who move from one

area to another.

STEVENS advised that his group has micro-filming

equipment in it's possession. CDFREY claimed that the

SAO will also obtain such equipment as soon as it possibly

can and in the future, all "

secure" messages between the tw

groups will be transmitted by micro-film.

In addition, STEVENS claimed that his group is

very much opposed to ROBERT BOLIVAR DE PUGH and claimed to

have information pertaining to TROY HAUGHTON's death, indicating

he may know someone who was involved in his murder. He indicated

that he would communicate with the SAO on this matter later

on. GODFREY said in his letters, STEVENS indicated he is very.

anti-police, FBI and informers. He said if he could he would

Kill them all, drop them in a hole in the desert and pore

lye on them. STEVENS offered to travel to San Diego to visit

with leaders of the SA0 and arrangements have been made.

GODFREY said that DAVIS has been working hard

on the next bulletin of the SAO and now has it ready to go

to the printers. This bulltin will be ten pages long and will

consist of eight pages of technical information pertaining

to explosives, booby traps, and other similar items.

The

other two pages will contain general information relating

to news, recruiting, training, etc.

NW 55009 DocId: 32989524 Page 1366

GODFREY also said that WALT and EDITH GUIRE

have now agreed to do research for the SAO on subjects

of interest to the organization. The GUIRES reside at

4114 Massachusetts, La Mesa, California, where they have

telephone number 463-4648.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RECALLED FROM MY VISIT

WITH GERALD SMITH OF THE NSWPP.

He always goes armed to the NSWPP meetings as do

all members of the group. I suspect that these people are

generally armed at all times. However SMITH indicated to

me that he and the NSWPP do not believe in violent armed

revolutions at this time.

He explained this position by stating that he believes

that there really are no such things as political questions or

issues. He said he believes the basis for all such political

questions and issues actually lies in racial concerns.. He

said because of this he feels that eventually the people in the

United States will become fed up with racially oriented oppressions

and will vote the NSWPP into power at the polls, hence no need

for a revolution.

SMITH has a weird appearance and is not physically

tough looking as you might expect a Nazi to be.

BOB MAYER is now living at 2204 Mt. Clair Street,

San Diego, California and has telephone number

284-3697. The house at this address was purchased by him

from CHUCK SPERRY, the local leader of the John Burch Society.

As you will remember MAYER is supposed to marry SPERRY's

daughter soon. MAYER, who was formerly a Marine,

spent

some time in Vietnam and claims to have been wounded there.

The other person referred to is CHUCK PEARCE. He

is a member of the Army's Special Forces Unit in San Diego.

With regard to the two Nazi factions at Los Angeles

I have heard that JOE TOMASI claims that SCOTT WINCHESTER's

group is defunct, hovever WINCHESTER claims his group isstill

going and is the most active.

JEROME

November 5, 1971

I was talking with SAM DAVIS this morning

and he told me that SCOTT WINCHESTER'S Nazi Group

at Los Angeles has folded up. He said WINCHESTER

apparently ald not think his group was doing anything

worthwhile. I am supposed to meet with DAVIS

tomorrow to discuss our strategy with regard to

WINCHESTER and his group.

DAVIS wants me to go with

him to Los Angeles next Saturday to talk with WINCHESTER

as it appears that WINCHESTER and the supporters he

has left may now be ready to join the SAo.

I was also by the old address of the Message

Information Center earlier today. It looks to me as

though the Message Information Center may have moved

as the building where it used to be is now being

remodeled into a very plush office space.

I was also talking to STAN MC DADE who told

me he had received in the mail a brand new issue of

"On Target" which came from Maryland and which claimed

to be the place of the Minuteman Organization. I will

attempt to obtain the publication from him.

He sald

he has no idea as to how the publishers öf

the paper

might have obtained his name and address, although he

said he did write to a gun parts shop in

• Maryland

approximately one week before he received the paper.

It has come to my attention that JERRY LEE BUSCH,

GEORGE HOOVER, and one or two of their friends have been

present at the protest demonstrations sponsored by the

supporters of PETER BOHMER. Apparently, they were taking

photographs and gathering other information for the use of

SAO. The SAo, by the way, wants to put out a counter-

intelligence ype bulletin on BOHMER for the purpose of

Inforning right wing activists in this area as to what is

going on with regard to BOHMER, and also to create a stir

and cause some concern for their safety among the left wing

activists.

It has come to my attention by way of RON ZARICK,

who I talked to yesterday, that there is an individual named

SCOTTIE SCHULIz in the area. SCHULTZ is known to be an informer

for AID and 1s believed to have been responsible for setting

up the arrest and conviction of BUD KITCHENS. He has been

• gone from the san Diego area for a considerable period of time

but is back nosing around again. ZARICK said there seems to

be particular interest in JOHN BUSH on the part of ATFD and

• ZARICK feels BUSH may be the next one to be arrested.

I had a conversatica with TOM FORREST yesterday.

He said he had received information that there is a ATFD

Informant working in this area again and he wanted to make

sure that everyone was alerted. He said this individual 1s

named (INU) LARKIN, 1s about 50 years o1d, 5'8" tall, 150

pounds, with short red hair and a red complexion. Apparently

ATFD has attempted to use this individual in the San Diego

area on previous occasions. I was told that LARKIN was trying

to sell 40 machine guns to SAM DAVIS.

SAM DAVIS and STAN MC DADE are attempting to raise

enough money to open a gun shop in this area which will be

called the "Minuteman Armory".

Along the same line, BILL GUIETIE of Bullseye Gun

Shop; CHUCK PEARCE of the John Birch Society; and BARRY GODFREY

of the SAO, are to get together and set up an ammunition dumo

somewhere in the desert.

They have also discovered that receivers for light

• •30 caliber machine guns can be easily manufactured with a

regular milling machine from flat pieces of steel which are then

welded together. The "Minuteman Armory" may Involve Itself in

manufacturing some of these receivers.

I was In contact with GEORGE HOOVER yesterday.

He claimed that he, in turn, 1s in contact with some

Individuals, whose identities he did not even hint ats

who claim to have possession of a large quantity of stolen

U.S. govemment gold.

According to HOOVER, this gold is in a 55 gallon

drum and must weigh close to 1,000 pounds. He said the gold,

of which he has a sample, is in small pieces which have the

appearance of having been melted. HOOVER said he has been

asked by

these other individuals to help sell the gold. He

said the idea is to package it in ten or twenty pound lots

but did not know what the asking price would be. He said he

would furnish me a sample of this material tomorrow, which

I could take to PAUL RUPLINGER or some other place and have

analyzed. He said the people selling the gold will want as

much for it as they can get.

HOOVER, himself, continues to

reside in housing

furnished for him at the wood. King. Wood. Yards on Magnolia

near Santee. He is currently employed making deliveries

of

NW 55009 DocId:32989524 Page 1379

---

## Page 1380

wood for the wood yards, receiving $5 per delivery. He

claims to be making six to eight deliveries a day.

With regard to DON CAREY, it has come to my

attention that he has recently been spreading rumors designed

to place JERRY GETER, BARRY GODFREY, and others in a bad light

with other right-wing activists. However, most people who

know CAREY do not pay much attention. to him as 1t 1s generally

held that he is "nuts" and is really flipping out. I do not

think CAREY is currently employed. He is described as follows:

Race

Age

Sex

Height

Waight

Build

Hair

White

Approximately 40 (looks younger)

Male

5'7" - 5'8"

150 pounds

Wiry

Very dark colored

He resides with his mother, JEANETTE WORDELL, at 4069

El Ca jon Boulevard, where he has telephone number 284-7807. He

also claims to have a place at campo for use as a hide-out if

necessary. To the best of my recollection, he drives a gray

Jeep-type Toyota vehicle.

Last night I was at JERRY GEIER's house. The con-

versation got around to the theft, some time ago, of weapons

from the ROIC Armory at Sweetwater High School. GEIER said

that the evening before the theft, he received a telephone call

...

..::

''i''!

NW 55009 DooId: 32989524 : Page 1380°

---

## Page 1381

from a friend (unnamed) who asked him if he wanted some BAR's

and other similar weapons, to which GETER replied that he did.

His friend said he had a line un a supply of such weapons and

that they would be available the following night. GEIER said

that on the next night he and his friend went to a pre-arranged

location, picked the weapons up and brought them back to GEIER's

residence where they were stored in i

the garage. According to

GETER, the following morning when he went to work, a fellow

employee jokingly asked him if he had purchased any machine guns.

GEIER said "What do you mean?", whereupon the other individual

pointed out to him an article in the paper regarding the theft

of weapons from the Sweetwater High School ROIC Armory. GEIER

said he checked the list of weapons reported to have been stolen

against those he had purchased the previous evening and found it

to match exactly. He said he immediately dashed home, wiped all

the weapons down for fingerprints, and returned them to the source

from which they had been obtained. However, neither he nor his

friend received any money back that they had already paid for

the weapons.

GEIER said that the source of the weapons was the son

of the Army Sergeant regularly assigned to the ROTC Unit at

Sweetwater High School. He said this individual apparently backed

NW 55009 DocId: 32989524

## Page 1382

.. .

a truck into the wall of the room containing the ROIC weapons,

breaking a large hole through the which the weapons were loaded

Into the truck. GEIER said that after the weapons

were returned

to the Army Sergeant's son, he took them to the Singing Hills

Golf Course where they were later found laying on the grass.

Word has come to me from STAN MC DADE that WILLIAM

WEATHERBY has either quit or been dropped from the NSWPP.. He

may be the Lieutenant of GERALD I. SMITH who quit when ordered

by SMITH to leave his Mexican wife. I understand that GEORGE

HOOVER is working to recruit WEATHERBY for the SAO.

It has also come to my attention that the NSWPP has

opened a formal headquarters and office space eithes on University

or El Cajon Boulevard in-La Mesa.. The rent for this space 1s

$125 per month, and I believe is being financed primarily by

VIC WALTON and/or JOE BRINKER.

I have also heard that BARRY GODFREY will be working

with STAN MC DADE and GEORGE HOOVER to compile a llst of the

local NSWPP members. I don't know how many members may be left

following the recent shake-up in that organization.

Last night I went to the NSWPP White Power

Information Center located at 7720 University, La Mesa,

California and spoke with GERALD SMITH, using an assumed

name. This is the first time that I have talked with SMITH

and I found him to be very egotistical, highly talkative

and very much down on the Minuteman organization and related

right-wing activities. He claimed to know all of the Minuteman.

leaders and indicated that he and his group went on maneuvers

with the Minuteman organization all the time. He stated

that he thinks the Minuteman organization is comprised

of a bunch of cowards who will not do anything to protect

the country when the time comes. He impressed me as being

really "nuts".

SMITH mentioned VIC WALTON as one of the backers

of the NSWPP and hinted that most of the financing for his

grip comes from out-of-state.

He said that his. plans for the

1972 Replubican National Convention will include picketing

of both the Republican and Left Wing groups.

According to SMITH, the NSWPP holds a meeting

each Wednesday night at 7:30 PM which is open to the public.

## Page 1385

This White Power Information Center is open on

Tuesday, Thursday and Friday evenings from 6:00 to 8:30 PM

and on Saturday afternoons.

He said the NSWPP rented the space for the

White Power Information Center under the ruse that it

was to be used for a book store, otherwise the group either

would already have been evicted or never would have been rented

the space in the first place.

While he was there, there was another strange looking

young male individual with SMITH who he believed was named

RAY WILLIAMS OF WILSON.

He was described as follows:

Race

Height

Weight

Hair

Complexion

Build

Eyes

Dress

White

5'6"

130-135 pounds

Blond

Pale

Slender

Blue

Wearing skin-tight pants and an

Eisenhower jacket with a swastika

on he colar.

I have heard that GEORGE HOOVER is attempting to

wean this person away from SMITH.

In addition, from their conversation it appears

that the NSWPP is down on STAN MC DADE.

I do not know of the individual named STEVEN

LINN CROPSEY of anything about his involvement in the

NSWPP.

I was in contact with SAM DAVIS who is in the

process of making up a master file on right-wing activities.

Hopefully I will have access to this information.

DAVIS also advised that the new ten page SAO

bulletin has been printed and should be out tomorrow.

He stated that he is anxiousto start preparing another

special intelligence bulletin to be put out by the SAO.

This time he wants the target of the bulletin to be some

nationally known figure in the new left, such as JERRY RUBEN,

WILLIAM RUNSTLER Or ABBIE HOFFMAN.

I learned last night from BOB MAYER that he, SAM

DAVIS, and BARRY GODFREY were at San Diego State College (SDSC)

yesterday putting up SAO stickers, particularly around the

office of Professor PETER BOHMER.

I understand that in the evening some harassing

telephone calls were made by SAO members to the residence of

Professor BOHMER.

SAM DAVIS brought to my attention the fact that

CY ANDERSON is suppose to be in town from Seattle, Washington,

next week. DAVIS said that ANDERSON is going to bring a

large quantity of stuff to sell, including the following:

Military mountain style mummy sleeping bags at

three fof fifty dollars

New military field jackets with hoods at eleven

dollars each and without hoods, nine dollars each

Parachute rifle grenades at two dollars a piece

or six for ten dollars.

Military brass and steel cleaning rods

Two new AR-180's at $210.00 each.

One used AR-14 at $225.00.

One used high stand

.22 caliber pistol at

seventy dollars.

One used Colt Diamond Back .38 caliber pistol

at $90.00.

One used M-1 carbine at seventy dollars.

One used M-2 carbine at one hundred thifty

five dollars.

One used 1903 Springfield at sixty five

dollars.

One used Model 97 Winchester Riot Gun at

eighty five dollars.

DAVIS claims he has also contacted some acquaintances

of his in Kansas and Oklahoma regarding establishing the

SAO in those area.

He further claimed to have recruited

two unidentified individuals at Carson near Los Angeles,

California, into the SAO. He also advised he has received

letters of inquiry regarding the SAO from the Redding,

California, area, and from some where in the State of Maryland.

Yesterday BOB MAYER, STAN MC DADE, SAM DAVIS, NICK

HOOVER, FRANK YACOPEC, "FAT JOHN" LENNOX (who has telephone

number 284-1442) and LENNOX's shadow, a kid named DENNIS

(LAST NAME UNKNOWN), were all at BARRY GODFREY'S house dis-

cussing the shooting of a girl at Professor BOHMER'S house

and the implication that the SAO was responsible or at least

involved. All those present were expecting to be interviewed

regarding the shooting, and were bragging about what they

were going to do when the police came to call. As usual,

YACOPEC and MAYER were all excited about pulling off some

big stunt.

i coote

DAVIS said he had been talking to BETTIE HAUGHTON,

and according to her, the newspaper publicity which the SAo

got in connection with the shooting incident, has stirred

up a lot of interest among the Right Wing oriented individuals

she knows. She told DAVIS she had received 25 to 30 contacts

from people who formerly belonged to the Minutemen (MM)

Organization who she said were interested in Joining the sao.

She also told DAVIS she had showed some of the SAO literature

to HUGH LANCE, who is suppose to be a Deputy Sheriff at either

NW 55009 Doold: 32989524 Page 1391

---

## Page 1392

Big Pine or Long Pine, California. She said he was very

enthusiastic about the SAO and might join. DAVIS said

we will have to make arrangements to contact him.

DAVIS mentioned he has another new SAO contact

somewhere in the Los Angeles, California, area.

STAN MC DADE claimed to have received a telephone

call from TOM DRISCOLL, a Customs Inspector at the Border at

San Ysidro, California. DRISCOLL apparently asked MC DADE

if he knew where DRISCOLL.could purchase several machine

guns. MC DADE said he once sold DRISCOLL a light point

•30 caliber machine gun.

DAVIS said again that CY ANDIRSON is suppose to be

down in the San Diego, California, area, sometime in the near

future. DAVIS said ANDERSON had been talking about going to

the Mardi Gras in New Orleans and wants DAVIS to go with

him. However, DAVIS probably will not be able to as he is

currently on unemployment.

The following are San Diego, California, area,

members of the SAO who are known to me:

JERRY LYNN DAVIS

STANLEY DON MC DADE

GEORGE M. HOOVER

JAMES EVAN POTO.

HOWARD BARRY GODFREY

FRANK YACOPEC

ROBERT S. MAYER

PAUL RUPLINGER

In addition, I believe that one AL RUPP, a close

personal friend of DAVIS, may also be sort of a hip pocket

member of the SAO.

Specific members and supporters of the SAO include

HOWARD FRANCIS CLARK, who has been

given a membership application

form which he has not returned yet, and ED ANDREWS, who has

been contributing finances to the SAO, but says he is not

ready to become a member yet. ANDREWS talks about returning

to the state of Arkansas, in the not too distant future, and

has indicated he might be agreeable to doing some recruiting

and organizing work there for the sao.

BETTIE HAUGHTON has been doing some of the

organizational and printing work for the SAO. She has an

off-set press which is located in the garage of the house

belonging to WALT and EDITH GUIRE located at 4114 Massachusetts,

La Mesa, California. The GUIREs are former MM sympathizers,

and are close friends of BETTIE HAUGHTON.

About December 29, 1971, the GUIREs agreed to do some

research work for the SAO:

In addition, DAVIS said that WALT HAYWARD wrote

to him recently about the SAO Offering to help in any way he .

can. However, he claimed he has been out of work for awhile

and is short of money. Furthermore, SAM mentioned he would

like to take BARRY GODFREY and pay a call to LOU CONDE to ask

him for donations and other assistance for the SAO.

SAM said that SCOTT WINCHESTER, leader of the

National Socialist American Workers Party, faction of the

Nazi Group at Los Angeles, California, is to be in town

tomorrow, January 15, 1972. Apparently the purpose of his

visit will be to discuss the possibility of setting up some

kind of a quasi alliance between the SAO and the NSAWP. •

The name GENE BOZARTH has come to my attention as

a likely source of good information regarding Left Wing

activities on the San Diego State College (SDSC) campus.

When I was at DAVIS' house last night, talking

about the visit of WINCHESTER to San Diego, California, AL

RUPP was there, which kind of put the dampers on the discussion.

Last night BARRY GODFREY told that earlier in the

day two San Diego, California, Police Department, detectives

had come to his house questioning him about the shooting

incident at the residence of Professor PETER BOHMER On

January 6, 1972. GODFREY said the detectives names, SANDERS

and SHIVELY, came on very strong as though GODFREY was a self-

admitted

member of the SAO. They asked what he knew about

the shooting incident and whether the SAO had been involved.

He told them he did not know anything about the shooting

except when he had read the paper, and he did not elaborate

on the SAO. They then asked him whether he had any 9 mm.

weapons to which he replied he did not and that he did not like

that caliber. Following that, they asked him if he knew anyone

in the SAO who had anything to do with the incident and GODFREY

said that he did not. The detectives then said the shooting

incident was a very bad deal, and GODFREY agreed with them

stating it was very unprofessional and that if someone had

really wanted to do something to Professor BOHER, they could

have easily taken the front half of his building off.

GODFREY said the detectives were somewhat interested

in his automobile, and explained to him that they had pre-

viously observed him visiting at the residence of JERRY LYNN

DAVIS.

Last evening BARRY GODFREY told me that SAM DAVIS

had been interviewed by the same two detectives who talked

to GODFREY the day before. He said they asked SAM if he was

a member of the SAO and he said he was. They then asked him

if he was responsible for the shooting incident at Professor

BORNER's house or if he knew of anyone who was involved in

the incident to which DAVIS replied no. He then told the .

detectives that if the SAO, as an organization, had wanted to

do something like that, Proîessor BOHMER would have been leveled

to the ground. They then asked DAVIS many questions about the

SAO to which he answered as truthful as he was able, and

particularly they asked if the SAO intended to put out more

bulletins similar to the one it had prepared on Professor BOriER.

DAVIS told them that the SAO did intend to print such bulletins,

which caused the detectives to ask him if the same number

of bulletins would be sent out or if more or less would be

sent. DAVIS said more and indicated that the next bulletin would

be sent to about three hundred people; the one after that to

about five hundred people and the one after that to about

one thousand people. According to DAVIS, this caused the

detectives to become very upset and they said they did not

think sending out so many bulletins was a very good idea as

:

MY 55009

DocId: 32989524

## Page 1401

this could caust a lot of trouble for somebody.

The detectives then asked DAVIS about the weapons

which he owned and indicated they were aware that he has had

about forty hand guns registered to him, including several

9 mm. weapons. DAVIS apparently told them he does not pre-

sently own any 9 mm. weapons, and satisfactorily explained

to them the disposition of those which he once avned.

..;

I have learned that the Bulls Eye Gun Shop in El

Cajon, California, has been closed as it was not making much

money. BILL GUIETTE, the former manager, is now hanging around

with a friend named LARRY BROWN at the Jiffy Machine Shop.

Most of the gun shop inventory, including many weapons, is now

located in GUIETTE's garage at his home.

TOM FORREST has a business establishment named

the Tom Forrest Company located in the Midway Industrial Center

on Kurtz Street just off Rosecrans. He is usually there most

afternoons and evenings.

I was at FORREST'S place last night and learned

that he had many bi-pods fro M-14 rifles, which were probably

stolen. He said he got them from a Marine who had just walked

in off the street with them. Furthermore, I was digging

around in FORREST's backs room, and found there in the neighbor-

hood of one hundred boxes of what appeared to be barrelled

M-14 actions. I opened one of the boxes sufficiently to see

what was inside,

and assumed that the rest of the boxes had

the same thing in them. In my opinion, It is likely that these

barrelled actions were suppose to have been destroyed at a

place like Iort Ord, but somehow, got into FORREST's possession

instead.

With regard to the shooting incident at Professor

BOHMER's house, FORREST said he had been contacted by two

detectives from the San Diego, California, Police Department.

Apparently SAM DAVIS once had two 9 mm. pistols, and when he

was interviewed by the detectives, he told them he sold one

to TOM FORREST, and the other to an individual named JACK

RICHARDS, a local "gun nut" type. FOREST said he guessed

the detectives got in touch with him to check DAVIS' story out

and verified that DAVIS did, in fact, seil him one of the two

pistols. However, FORREST conveniently was unable to renember

what he did with the gun after

he bought it.. He told me

confidentially he had sold it to a Mexican in Tijuana, Baja

California, Mexico.

FORPEST said the detectives seemd to have been

convinced that the weapons used in the BOHMER's shooting incident

was a Browning High Power. They also asked FORREST if he was

a member of the SAO which he denied. They then asked FORREST

if he knew whether BARRY GODFREY owned or had purchased or

sold any 9 mm. weapons, and what he usually bought from FORREST,

when he did business with him. FORREST said he told them

that GODFREY was not know to have any 9. mm. weapons and

did not particularly like them, that he preferred .45 caliber

pistols and .30 and that those were the only type he had

purchased from FORREST. The detectives then asked FORREST

whether SAN DAVIS ever came by and who with. FORREST told

him he had seen DAVIS in his shop, accompanied by CY ANDERSON

and BARRY GODIREY. FORREST said he was impressed that the

detectives were very excited about the SAO and he told them

he had seen the SAO bulletin which was put out on BOHMER.

The detectives then indicated they might contact GODFREY again

and asked FORREST if he knew what shift GODFREY worled at the

Fire Department.

I also saw GIORGI HOOVER yesterday. He is still up

in the air about being interviewed by the Police Department

over the BOHMER shooting. He said if the Police Department

came to interview him, he would tell then exactly what he

thought of them. (He does not think kindly of them). He said

11 the Federal Bureau of Investigation attempted to interview

him, he would simply say that he believed the FBI to be an

unconstitutional body and an agent of a foreign power and would

refuse to be interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation,

DAVIS claims he has obtained the keys to both the

gate and the fence as well as the door to the explosives

magazine of a sand and gravel company located on Mission Gorge

• Road. He said he also has a complete inventory of the contents

of the magazine and said it appears there are enough explosives

in the magazine to fill a semi-trailer truck. He said he

has a plan, the basis of which is to go into the magazine at

night with a truck, load up as much explosives as the truck

will carry and then go out locking the door and gate behind

but leaving a time delay charge behind to blow up the

magazine and its contents so no one would ever know how

much, if any, of the explosives were taken..

It should be remembered that DON CAREY was

suppose

to have been a powder monkey at that location in the past,

however, DAVIS said that JIM POTO was the one who actually

came up with the keys. DAVIS did not explain how or where

POTO got them.

FRANK YACOPEC and FORGE HOOVER have been

getting together. lately and may decide to start

working together on some of their weird projects.

As I mentioned before, the Yuma Gun Show

Is coming up on the 25th, 26th & 27th of this month.

CY ANDERSON will be down from Seattle to go to the

He will come to San Diego first and spend a

few days here selling verious things that he la

bringing down. SAM DAVIS and BARRY GODFREY are also

going to the gun show.

It is expected that EV MOORE

will be there from Phoenix, and that there will be

organizational meetings of the SAO during the gun show.

PAUL RUPLINGER has already put in an order

for $800 worth of the stuff which CY ANDERSON is

bringing down from Seattle.

This stuff is supposed to

Include some military-type sleeping bags, rifles, ammunition,

etcetera.

The San Diego Public Library maintains a name

index on all persons whose names figure prominently

In the local newspapers. It appears that someone has

gone through this index and systematically removed the

names of all individuals with Left Wing connections.

RUPLINGER was quite upset about this and said he had a

friend he would check with about it.

SAM DAVIS was also by the other day and said

he was looking for ten fuse-type blasting caps, but

did not say what for.

JERRY LEE BUSCH has become a pain in the neck

for the local people because of the trouble and commotion

he has caused and because of being so untrustworthy.

DAVIS

and others will make efforts to get him to leave town by

making him think that the Left Wingers are out to got him.

He also indicated that the SAO is giving up

to put out another special intelligence bulletin in the

near future.

I was in contact with SAM DAVIS this morning.

He told me that over last weekend, the SAO had received

mail from an individual at Phoenix, Arizona, who is

the area leader there of the National Socialist American

Worker's Party for SCOTT WINCHESTER at Los Angeles.

DAVIS said this individual was formerly a member of the

Minutemen Organization but had lost contact with that

group and had begun asgociating with the Nazi's.

In

his letter, this individual said he had heard of the

SAO and he

and his entire group were interested in

joining.

DAVIS said he had also. talked to BETTIE

HAUGHTON over the weekend. She told DAVIS she had

been contacted recently by two individuals from Covina.

She described these persons as formerly trusted leaders

In the Minutemen Organization under her husband. TROY.

She said these persons were interested in joining the

SAO. One of them is supposedly moving to the State of

Oregon in the near future, and indicated he would organize

for the SAO there.

She also tola DAVIS that her husbana, TROY,

had once borrowed money from these individuals

and

In return had given them, as security, two S1 milameter

mortars with a number of

rounds of ammunition and a

case of 36 grenades. The amount of money owing on these

weapons is about 5100. SAM said he might sell some of

the grenades at $10 apiece to pay off this debt. He also

claimed that he can get additional rounds for the 81

milameter mortars at s10 apiece, but did not say where or

how .

Covina in the near future, and I will try then to learn

more about them.

It is well known that TROY HAUGHTON had a habit

of borrowing money around from among his friends.

When I

-' was last at LOU CONDE's place, I saw an I.O.U. there to

him from TROY for $500.

NN 55009 DooId: 32989524 Page 1415

## Page 1416

It is also possible that the two individuals

from Covina may know the whereabouts of the Army Field

Hospital which TROY HAUGHTON is supposed to have stashed.

DAVIS also Indicated that the SAO may put out

a poster this weekend in the form of a wanted poster

showing President NIxON to be wanted for treason in

connection with his trip to China.

I learned this morning from BARRY GODFREY

that he had been in contact with an individual named

CALVIN FOX. FOX has just recently moved to the San

Diego area from Los Angeles, and is operating a Gulf

Service Station at the corner of Mollison and Broadway

in El Cajon, California. FOX was supposedly a former.

member of the Minutemen Organization at Los Angeles

and has Minutemen Serial Number A60065.

The A on the

serial number may mean that he as recruited by an

Individual named LLOYD PULLEN. FOX claims to have been

married about four years ago to a girl from Yugoslavia

at London, England.

FOX was recommended to GODFREY by his letter

carrier, TOM OSBORNE. It appears that FOX may be the

next new member of the SAO and that OSBORNE may also

join some time in the future:

It has come to my attention that the Reverend

CARL, MC INTYRE is coming to town next wednesday, and

will speak at a rally and picket to take place in front

of the main U.S. Post Office in downtown San Diego, to

protest President NIXON's trip to China.

This appearance

on the part of MC INTYRE is being sponsored by TIM O'HAY,

LILA BUCK and others of the SCOTT Memorial Baptist Church

in San Diego.

GEORGE HOOVER claims that he got a telephone

call from either/or both the Gunsmoke Ranch and the

Fleury Ranch in Harbison Canyon, that officers from the

San Diego Police Department had been there looking for

him. He said he was later interviewed at his residence

by these police officers, who told him they had received

an anonymous telephone call informing them that HOOVER

was a member of the sAo, and that he had been involved

in the shooting of PAULA THARP at the rosidence of PETER

BOHMER. HOOVER said he simply told them he was not a

the shooting incident.

HOOVER said he suspects that the

SAM DAVIS claims there will be a meeting

tomorrow between him and BARRY GODFREY and the

two Individuals from Covina, California, to make

the transfer of the two 81 milameter mortars and

the box of hand grenades.

DAVIS said he will put up

half of the money required and wants GODFREY to come

up with the other $50.

The meeting will take place

"safe" house somewhere in the area at about 2:00

In the afternoon.

DAVIS will come by GodFray's house

and then they will go to make the meeting in GODFREY's

truck, a white Ford Shortbed Pick-up Truck, with a

camper on the back, and with California license

99704F.

After obtaining the mortars and hand grenades,

DAVIS claims he will leave them at some other house he

has in mind.

According to DAVIS, the SAO has electèd to

go ahead with printing and putting out the wanted

posters on President NIXON.

According to DAVIS, PAUL

RUPLINGER will finance the printing which will be done

• by BETTIE HAUGHTON. The original plan is to contract

for 10,000 copies of the posters and to have them

distributed by CY ANDERSON in the Seattle, Washington

area; EV MOORE, at Phoenix, Arizona; LYLE MANNING, In

State of Utah; JESSE CLAYBURN STEVENS, at Baltimore,

Maryland; and of course all over the San Diego area.

Apparently, there was an article which appeared

In the February 9, 1972, issue of the

Daily Aztec

which must have greatly disturbed the Left Wingers on

that campus as they went around and gathered up all the

copies of the paper they could find and then burned them.

The burning of the papers was carried on television.

I understand that DAVIS received a telephone

call this morning from the two individuals at Covina,

California, who called to say that they would not be

able to deliver the two 81 milameter mortars and the

box of hand grenades as arranged. They explained they

had buried these items and were unable to locate them

when they went

to dig them up.

They said they would

try to get a metal detector and look for them again.

However, it appears this operation may be postponed

for an indefinite period of time.

The Individual named DICK DEXTRAZE, who has

been staying at the Fleury Place in Harbison Canyon,

is again suspected of being an infiltrator.

GEORGE

HOOVER : fed DEXTRAZE some phony information to the

effect that local Right Wingers are maintaining a

fully armed war plane at a landing field in the San

Diego area.

In less than a week, this information was

printed in

the most recent issue of the

, "O.B. Rag

HOOVER and others are talking about making DEXTRAZE

the subject of an object lesson for the Left Wingers.

The President NIXON wanted posters are to go

to press today and to be on the streets Monday.

The

number of copies to be printed has been reducad to

5,000. The format of the posters will be as follows:

At the top will be the words wanted for Treason,

below which will appear a photograph of the President,

and underneath that a description including his last known

address.

At the bottom will be a suggestion that the

President be impeached and be tried for treason by the

proper authorities.

Attached are copies of all the redent publications

and other papers of the SAO.

I was talking with STAN MC DADE last

week. We were discussing the situation at the

residence of RICHARD and GENEVIEVE FLEURY in

Harbison Canyon.

According to MC DADE, RICHARD

FLEURY claims that on the morning of Saturday,

2/19/72, he was walking out in his front yard

when someone shot at him four times from across

the canyon. Following this, his wife, already

upset by his friends and activities,. came unglued

and hit him over the head with a lamp, following

which a big fight resulted. She told him that

because of his friends and

activities, he was going

to get her and all of their children killed. The

Sheriff's Office was called and FLEURY moved out

and went to stay with GEORGE HOOVER at his place.

MC DADE said GENEVIEVE FLEURY later called the

Sheriff's Office and them come and pick up all of

her husband's guns including a .9 milameter pistol,

which they seemed very elated to find. MC DADE

said HOOVER and RICHARD FLEURY are blaming the

shooting incident on JERRY LEE BUSCH, and DICK

DEXTRAZE, who sometimes stays at the FLEURY place.

When RICHARD FLEURY went rack to get his guns, he

supposedly found DEXTRAZE there with his wife.

MC DADE fears that HOOVER and FLEURY may attempt to

take some drastic action against DEXTRALE DeLleVing

that he has been breaking the FLEUry family up.

MC DADE said that BUSCH Is apparently leaving

for Canada today to take a job there and may be doing

so bacause HOOVER is so angry at him.

I would estimate that the SAO has received

approximately $300 to $400 now in donations, membership

application fees, and monthly dues.

SAM DAVIS has

been keeping this money and most of it has been spent

on printing and postage costs for the SAo.

DAVIS

told me that DONNA LEE HARTLEY of Vista, California,

recently sent $15 into the SAO with a letter requesting

all of the SAO training literature.

Apparently, the plans which JIM POTo had

of going back to the Chicago, Illinois area to open

up a new restaurant there for the restaurant chain

he works for have not materialized. It looks as though

POTO will remain in the San Diego area for the time

being and will help BARRY GODFREY and DAVIS organize

for the SAo.

DAVIS has asked GODFREY to do a new

special intelligence bulletin for the SAO on some

leading figure in the New Left Movement in tha San

Diego area.

I have heard no new Information on the

situation at the FLEURY place in Harbison Canyon.

GOOFREY DAVIS claims that an individual named

GIL ARRUDA may join the SAO in the near future and

may allow the SAO and its members to use his place

for firearms practice and training purposes. ARRUDA

about 190 acres of open land up in Wild Cat Canyon

above Lakeside.

DAVIS said he has been thinking about

working out a method of moving up to this place to live

I have been given the assignment of going out

to sign up. CALVIN FOX as a

member of the SAO and will

do so today.

Some consideration has been given to having

GEORGE HOOVER come out in the open as a public recruiting

officer for the SAO. HOOVER claims to have heard from

SAM DAVIS called me this morning and said

he had been talking to BETTIE HAUGHTON.

Apparently,

she is about ready to leave San Diego and go up to

Big Pine, California, where she will live and

eventually be married.

According to DAVIS, BETTIE

has a miniature Minox camera, which she wanted to

sell for about $50. DAVIS said she went to a camera

store and found she could only get $30 for the Minox.

She was kind of upset about this and said she would

rather let the SAO have it for $25 for the use of the

organization. SAM and I will go by her place tomorrow

and I wail es

I will also find out then

exactly when she is leaving town.

SAM said he wants me to go with him tomorrow

to see the new female SAO member at Vista, named

DONNA LEE HARTLEY.

I understand that STAN MC DADE aná GEORGE

HOOVER went to El Monte, California, last Saturday

night to hear MATT KOEHL, National Commander of the

NSWPP, speak.

MC DADE also said he was going to

attend the rally at the San Diego NSWPP Headquarters

yesterday, to hear KOHL speak.

I went to see BETTIE HAUGHTON yesterday and

got the Minox camera togother with four rolls of film

and three gas masks. She said she is going to leave

town within two weeks.

SAM DAVIS was also with me and

she gave SAM some keys to a garage where all of the

old Minutemen camp gear is located. This stuff includes

cots, stoves, medical supplies, etcetera.

She also

told

SAM that a large quantity of explosives is supposedly

buried under the house of VAL BOYLE, TROY HAUGHTON'S

mother.

I also understand that JIM POTO and FRED

HAWES know something about this garage and hava some

of their stuff stored there too.

HAWES used to live

with BETTIE HAUGHTON and she and JIM POTO are on very

good terms.

When SAM DAVIS and BARRY GODFREY were at the

Yuma Gun Show weekend before last; they met with EV

MOORE and discussed a few details and plans about the

SAO but nothing very extensive.

Apparently, there is

a rumor going around that ROBERT DE PUGH, former National

leader of the Minutemen Organization, may already be

trying to make a comeback even though he is still in

prison. This rumor is based on the fact that certain

Individuals who did a lot of work for him and for the

Ku Klux Klan in the southwest are now highly placed in

the Llberty Lobby which is now setting up survival

groups and an underground organizational and communications

network. It is believed that all of this activity may

be part of plans for DE PUGH to come back and take over

again. One of the individuals involved in these activities

Is ALICE DUNN, who was formerly in the organization named

ANW 55009 DocId: 32989524 Page 1434

---

## Page 1435

American Volunteer Groups, and also worked for

DE PUGH as a fund raiser.

At the suggestion of EV MOORE, the new

SAo introduction letter and recruiting literature

will be sent out along with a coded coupon which

will have only a number rather than the recipient's

name, for him to use to request more information if

Interested in the SAO.

MOORE, who is supposed to be a master locksmith,

Indicated he would write a bulletin for the sAd on how

to jimmy doors and also, an advanced training bulletin

on lock picking and safe cracking.

BARRY GODFREY is to be the official SAO

photographer and a part. of his duties will include

taking and editing photographs of SAO training

sessions to be used for publicity.

WAIT GUIRE'S name was

mentioned as one

who might give propaganda

lectures.

The SAO will also, in the near future, publish

a bulletin on what members should do when they are

interviewed by the law.

This bulletin will include

suggestions such as keeping a loaded camera by the door

in order to take photographs of the interviewing officials,

obtaining the name and badge number of these officials

and make them wait while the appropriate agency is called

to verify their identity. BETTIE HAUGHTON has said she

once caught some ATFD Agents using FBI identification in

their interviews. These procedures are also a harrassment

tactic which may hopefully frighten away less serious

minded interviewers.

GEORGE HOOVER Claims he has not filed a Federal

Income tax return for several years. It is possible that

some of the others such as DAVIS may also not have filed

returns when required.

HOOVER also claims to have been

married twelve to fourteen years ago, but to have separated

from his wife after living together for only a short while.

HOOVER and DAVIS have known each other for approximately

ten years.

JANUARY 28, 1972

I was told by BARRY GODFREY that he and SAM DAVIS

went to see LOU CONDE this morning to ask him to help finance

some of the SAO's activities. When contacted, CONDE donated

a complete "Angry Thirteen" military radio set to the SAO

together with all of the antennas, crystals, the hand crank,

generator repair kit, etc. This is to be picked up later.

He also agreed to send the SAO some money and said he would

get support for the organization from certain other people

and would put the SAO in contact with the underground Cuban

Refugee Organization, Alpha 66.

Apparently CONDE is running for election to the

County Board of Supervisors for the seat now held by wALTER

SCHEIDLE. He claims he has the backing of both the La Jolla

and Clairemont Town Councils. He is also supposed to be

chairman of a couple of local parent associations and is

highly regarded in the Republican

Party for his previous

campaign efforts in behalf of Governor REAGAN.

CONDE claimed to DAVIS and GODFREY that a former

Special Agent of the FBI at San Diego named "BOB SUNDQUIRT".

or something similar, had oweà him a considerable amount of

money and that CONDE had been squeezing this individual for

Information even before he retired from the FBI. He said

the former Agent attempted to pay him off with bad checks

which came back marked "insufficient funas". CONDE said

he still has these checks and showed DAVIS and GODFREY one

for $200.00. He claimed that the former Agent is now working

for him as a carpenter doing boat repair work which CONDE

has contracted.

CONDE also talked about the publicity he received

in recent months when he offered to outfit and arm a patrol

boat to accompany the American tuna fishing fleet to South

American waters to keep them from being seized by Latin

American Navies. In this regard, he said that many people

came to see him from all over the country volunteering to

go and work as crew members on such an expedition.

CONDE indicated that he possessed either an

M-1 carbine which can be converted to fire fully automatic;

oI an M2 carbine, which lacks certain parts in order to

fire fully automatic, and asked DAVIS and GODFREY if they

would help him put it together. DAVIS said he would do

SO.

DAVIS also offered to use the organization and

facilities of the SAO to assist CONDE in his campaign.

This help would includa quietly planting literature for

CONDE on the SAO printing presses and also to assist him

in exposing problems

which his opponents may have.

I was in contact yesterday with RON ZARICK. As

usual, he was talking about firearms and other things. He

claimed he had recently acquired an M-28 Thompson Submachine

gun and an M-3 grease gun which he offered to sell to me.

He said he wanted to know whether I wanted them by tonight

at the latest. He is asking $200 for the M-28, and $125 for

• the M-3. This is more money than I can come up with.

He also claimed he had possession of some hand

grenade fuses, some practice grenades, and some smoke grenades.

He claimed these things came from a private collection of

an individual living somewhere north of San Francisco who'

was going to bring them down if ZARICK could sell enough of

them.

I also received a letter today from GENE BOSARTH,

P.O. Box 15662, San Diego, California, and home address 6979

Galewand, San Diego, who has offered to furnish information

to the SAO. He is a student at San Diego State College and

either has ties with or access to information about New

Left activities on that campus. In his letter, he indicated

he had come across some information which he thought might

be of interest to the SAO.

In addition, I was talking to STAN NC DADE this

morning. He told me he and HOWARD CLELANd were driving

out near the Singing Hills Golf Curse yesterday when they

noticed they were being followed by someone in what they

described as a yellow 1970 Mustang with California license

823 ETY. MC DADE said he and CLELAND took a round-a-bout

route to the San Diego Fish and Game Association Range

and the yellow car stayed with them all the way. Me DADE

said when they got out at the range, he and CLELAND acted

like they didn't know the other car had been following them.

He said the occupants of the other car also pretended the

same thing and came up to MC DADE and CLELAND offering to

sell them some riot guns. MC DADE said he and CLELAND

were suspicious of a set-up and backed out of the

situation saying they would have to think about it.

I have also talked today with SAM DAVIS.

He said

- he believed he had observed a car conducting a moving

surveillance of his house. He said the license number on

the car was YCD 112. He claimed he did not think the car

was a police department undercover car and thought perhaps

some Left Wingers had come up with his address. SAM said

this morning he received a Xerox copy of an SO application

form in the mail from one IOM PAINE (phonetic) enclosing

$5.00. The return address was a Post Office box in Tucson,

•Arizona. If I can, I will get the address later.

EV MOORE also wrote DAVIS and asked if there was

any way he and BARRY GODFREY could make it to the Tucson gun

show

this weekend, as there are some people at Tucson he wants

them to meet. He said he also had some good recruitment.

prospects for the StO. MOORE is supposed to be a master •

locksmith and has offered to write a training bulletin for

the SAO on lock picking. DAVIS said he would contact HOWARD

CLARK who now has a private pilot's license and see if he

can rent a plane with CLARK and fly over to Tucson to meet

MOORE.

.

SAM said the SAO had also received a letter from

a woman at Vista, California..

He said he. would give me

her name and address later. In the letter, she described

herself as a widow with two children and stated she wanted to

do something for her country and had been thinking about

-joining a police or sheriff's reserve unit. However, she

said she had heard about the SAO and thought that if it was

truly patriotic, she would rather join it.

SAM said the SAO had received another letter which

came from "Newsweek" magazine at Los Angeles asking if the

SAO would grant an interview to the magazine. In its

letter,

"Newsweek" said it was preparing an article dealing with

Leftist groups in the San Diego area in connection with the

1972 Republican National Convention. "Newsweek" said it had

Iun across the SAO and would like to do a colum on it too.

DAVIS said he thought he would like to give such an interview

if the meeting could be made secure and if the SAo's Post

Office Box number would appear in the article.

SAM said the SAD had also received a nice letter

from the "San Diego Evening Tribune" which also wants an

interview. He said in its letter, the "Tribune" said the

organization appeared secretive and wondered if the SAO

would allow the "Tribune" to do an article presenting the

organization's views. I understand that this was mentioned

to LOU CONDE when DAVIS and GODFREY went to see him and he

was very happy about it. He said he knows several people

very well at the "Tribune" and would talk to them and get

an assurance of favorable treatment of the SAo by the paper.

However, DAVIS thinks such an interview might be a little premature

6

said !

NW. 55009 DocId: 32989524 Page 1444

---

## Page 1445

as he feels that certain comments made in the interview might

be too much of a slap at the San Diego Police Department.

By the way,

when I was talking to STAN, he said

he would like to bury some more Mauser rifles because they

are cheap. He claims to have already buried some of these

rifles. He said the Customs Agent who had wanted to buy

•a machine gun from him had been back to see him again.

MC DADE said he thought che Customs Agent wanted to join

the SAO. GODFREY's opinion is that the guy is a real

"Rook".

MC DADE said that he had been in contact with

GEORGE HICOVER. He said HOOVER has been running around

with RICHARD and GENEVIEVE FLEURY who live in Harbison

Canyon across from the Gunsmoke Ranch. He said that JERRY

LEE BUSCH hes been living at the FLEURY place off and on

and has set up rifle and pistol ranges there where they

have been doing some target practice. HOOVER has apparently

been out attempting to recruit some members for the SAO and

has come up with a couple of prospects from the beach area

who are long hairs. He believes these people are Right

Wing-oriented but GODFREY says most likely they are attempting

to infiltrate the Sio for the Left.

On Saturday, the 15th of January, SCOTT WINCHESTER

came down to San Diego from Los Angeles. SAM and STAN met

him somewhere and then went to STAN's house to talk. GODFREY

met them there later. The discussion lasted for several hours.

WINCHESTER advised he was in the process of setting up a

headquarters for his organization at Los Angeles. He claimed

that he wanted to work with the SAo and said he would offer

the SAO the use of his facilities in los Angeles. Later,

DAVIS and GODFREY said they were cool to the idea of forming

an alliance with WINCHESTER as they think he is an idiot and

is lousy on his security precautions. They said they will

gradually break off contact with him.

During the meeting with WINCHESTER, the participants

took a break once because WINCHESTER said he wantea to go

and talk with some members of the local NSWPP Unit. Because

DAVIS and IC DADE are well-known to the local NSWPP, WINCHESTER

and GODFREY went, each using assumed names. They talked with

GERALD LEE SMITH, leader of the local NSWPP Unit. During

the conversation with SMITHI, WINCHESTER brought his own name

up and SMITH, not knowing whom he was talking to, made many

uncomplimentary remarks about WINCHESTER.

After returning to MC DADE'S house, WINCHESTER

talked a lot about anti-Semitism and how he believed himself

JANUARY 31, 1972

BY JEROME

I was talking yesterday with GEORGE HOOVER.

He has been spending a great deal of time at the residence

of RICHARD and GENEVIEVE FLEURY in Harbison Canyon across

the road from the Gunsmoke Ranch.

JERRY LEE BUSCHI has also been spending a lot

of time there and lives with the FLEURYs part time.

Another individual who also has been spending

a considerable amount of time with the FLEURYs is a person

whose name is DICK DEXTER Or DEXTRAND. DEXTER is a member of

the Swallows Nudist Camp which is also located across Harbison

Canyon Road from the FLEURYS. DEXTER has apparently been trying

to work a way into some of the Right Wing activities which other

people at the FLEURYs are involved in and is suspected of

being an infiltrator, mostly because of the fact he lives

in Ocean Beach.

FEBRUARY 2, 1

BY JEROME

Yesterday, I accompanied STAN MC DADE to keep

• an appointment with GENE BOSARTH, the San Diego State

College student who has. indicated a willingness to furnish

information about New Left oriented activities at San Diego

State College to the SAO. BOSARTH claimed to have written

letters to Governor REAGAN regarding the PETER BOHER situation

at State College requesting that some action be taken against

•

BOHMER. MC DADE backed off a little when BOSARTH mentioned

he had been contacted by the local office of the Celifornia

Bureau of Criminal Investigation and Identification and even

went so far as to suggest that we might do che same thing.

Later in the day, I learned from both MC DADE and

SAM DAVIS that there was a type of vigilante meeting in Lakeside

several days ago of local individuals and groups. It appears

this meeting was held to discuss and plan out actions to be

taken to keep hippies and other undesirable individuals out

of the Lakeside area during the Republican National Convention

in Sạn Diego this summer.

It was brought to my attention that the semi-annual

Yuma Gun Show will be held on the 25th, 26th, and 27th of

February. I was told that CY ANDERSON will be coming down

from Seattle to attend this gun show and will come to San

Diego several days in advance to take care of some business here.

PAUL RUPLINGER told me yesterday he was at an

NSWPP meeting last Wednesday night at the San Diego unit

headquarters. He said about 20 people were in attendance

and had come to hear a speaker from Los Angeles, known as

"Captain K" tell about recent confrontations by the NSWPP

and the Jewish Defense League at Los Angeles. He said

VIC WALION was one of those people he recognized as being

in attendance at this meeting.

I was also told yesterday by GEORGE HOOVER that

an NSWPP member named WAKEFIELD had been booted out of the

organization for engaging in unauthorized ativities such as

throwing bricks through the windows of various New Left

establishments.

UBJECT: Activities of Gerald I. Smith.

On Thursday night, January 4, 1973 Gerald Smith spoke to an evening

class at San. Diego State College. He does not remember the name of the

srofessor in charge of the class but says he teaches advertising and public

relations classes. Knowing what I do about San Diego State College, this

neans that the class is probably held in the Business Administration and

iathematics Building, one of the newest structures on campus. Gerald also

stated that the professor had dark curly hair and sported a beard. The

topic of the speech was the organizational structure of the National Social

White Peoples Party. Gerald states that he was well received by the class

and that there was no harrassment whatsoever. In fact, an invitation has

been extended to joseph Tomnasi via Smith to make a similar appearance

before the same class.

• On Sunday, January 7, 1973 Gene Cubbison of the Independent Newspaper

made a two-hour broadcast over radio station ESDO-Sen Diego. The broadcasi

included discussions of the Secret Army Organization, the FBI, Howard Barry

Godfrey and Gerald I. Snith. Ray Wilson notified Smith that the program

wes in progress but smith heard only about the last half hour of it. In

this broadcast, Cubbison was highly critical of the S40 and FBI. Cubbisor

said that Peter Bohmer was being unjustly persecuted by the authoritias:

He criticized the FBi for not cracking down on the SAO long before it dia

He challenged Barry

• Godfrey to call

in and defend his position. A similar

challenge was also issued to Gerald Smith but Godfrey seened to be the one

they really tried to bait. This program lasted from 9:30 to 11:30 a II.

During the program, at least one person did call in and this person vas

extremely critical of Smith. Smith believes this broadcast is merely an

'aitempt on Cubbison's part to sell more newspapers and to dredge up cla

right wing bogie men for the larxists to throw. rocks at.

Cubbison was also quite sarcastic toward Judge Froelich. He flatly

stated that the reason the judge delayed the sentencing of Bohmer was

because he was afraid to sentence him. He felt that the presence of the

large leftist crowd in the court room intimidated Judge Froelich. Gerali

Smith also feels this way about 1t.

That's about all for now. will be in touch when moze develops.

Sincerely,
