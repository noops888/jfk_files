countrios.

Guatenalan

Communist who received guerrilla training in Cuba February -

October 1962.

MIRANDA has said that he was in contact with

Subject when he was in Mexico in January - February 1962 on

his way to Cuba.

MIRANDA also said that he had met Subject

before whes surgeet taù mich indatro MIkOYhi la Cuba (in

MIRANDA has said that Subject has been a

close friend of Guatemalan Communist loader Bernardo LEMUS

(P-5025, 201-091575) since 1953 (when Subjoct first

came to Mexico).

(Source: captured documents)

1966 a "friend

from Guatemala" called Subject's office, saying

that he already knew Subject but that Subject did not know

that he was in Mexico and that he did not want to go to Subject's

office or use the telephone.

He was told to call back the next

day.

The next day "MIRANDA" (probably Ricardo MIRANDA Aldana)

called Subject's office, and Subject asked him to come to his

house (same as office) the following day at 1000 hours. (Source:

He seems to be very active among Spanish

Communists in Mexico and also frequently sets up neetings be-

tween Subject and Juan REJANO Porras (P-1027,

The latter is one of the leaders of the Spanish Communist

Party in Mexico but also has close ties to other Communist

groups, particularly the Cubans and Czechs as well as the

Mexicans, and on at least one occasion he was seen going to

the Cuban Embassy with one of the leaders of the Guatemalan

Communist Party in Mexico. REJANO is in almost daily contact

with ALVAREZ Posada, often says that he needs to see Subject,.

urgently, has several times asked about scholarships to the

USSR for

unidentified persons.

On 21 July 1967 it was reported

that Subject had given ALVAREZ Posada a letter that was to be

returned to RENANO, but often Subject arranges to see REJANO

personally at the latter's house.

"Max" told

ALVAREZ Posada that there was a letter "there" from Guatemala

that had been there since 22 June but "Max" had not been able

to reach ALVAREZ Posada before.

ALVAREZ Posada said he would

be home after 1600 hours (so that "Hax" could bring him the

letter).

(Source: LIFEAT).

Although it is pure guesswork,

the Station suggests that "Hax" might be Maximiliano #SALAZAR

Garcia (201-183293), a Guatemalan Communist living in Mexico.

SALAZAR has been very quiet recently,

but on 14 July 1965 he

was reported in contact with Carlos ILLESCAS Aguirre (cf. below)

about finding housing and & job for an unidentified boy,

and

it is entirely possible that he continues to be active behind

the scenes in Guatenalan exile affairs.

7.

Since June 1965 until as recently aB March 1967

Subject has been reported receiving telephone calls from a

"Carlos" with a non-Mexican accent.

Normally Subject and

"Carlos" simply agree to meet, without naming the place.

Twice "Senor Jacobo" has been

mentioned in an unclear context

during their conversations.

(Source: LIFEAT). Although "Carlos"

as & name is not much of a lead, the Station suggests that he

|| might be identical

with Carlos. ILLESCAS Aguirre (Hernandez)

201-764855), Guatemala, Comnunist living in Mexico.

with them.

In 1953, when ILLESCAS was still working at the

Guatemalan EmbasBY da Mexico, (Source: LINLUCK) •

he reportedly was very active

as a courier for the Soviets

In 1959

ILLESCAS was reported in contact with Nikolay Vasilyevich

2 AKSENOV (201-106469) ,suspect KGB Officer who was, then

Assistant Soviet Cultural Attache,& job later taken over by

Subject

(Source:

LIFEAT).

In 1951-62 ILLESCAS was reported

to bo still in contact with the Soviets in regard to guerrilla

plans for Guatemala (Source: LINLUCk) •

On 23 August 1967 it

was reported that ILLESCAS passed 22,000 Mexican pesos to oue

of the Guatemalan Communist leaders in Mexico.

This money was

described as a monthly subsidy from either the Cubans or the

Soviets intended to help the Guatemalan Communists in jail in

Mexico. (Source: LIREBEL-2) •

The above references to

"Senor

) Jacobo" might possibly bave meant Jacobo ARBENZ Guznan, former

president of Guatemala; unfortunately the tapes of the

conver-

sations have been erased and the exact context in bich this

name was mentioned can no longer be reconstructed.

8.

Hava (Eva) (P-11484), wife of Guatemalan Communist

Sergio de la PENA, was reported to have met Subject in May 1965.

On 29 May 1965 Subject invited Hava to dinner, apparently at the

suggestion of Enrique SEKO Calev, Mexican Cormunist leader.

Subject told Hava that he was interested in her contacts with

other embassies and particularly asked her to put him in touch

with Americans.

Hava was subsequently reported having Subject

and his wife to dinner on several occasions.

(Source: LIFEAT) •

(It seems obvious that Subject was fishing for leads through

Hava; however, Hava!s Guatemalan contacts may well have been of

no interest to Subject.)

2R

Victor RICO Galan (P-7354, 201-336474), Spanish-born

Mexican Connunist journalist, Lagent of Cuban governent known

to have been

sent by the Cubans

to talk to Guatemalan guer-

rillas in 1963,.

in prison since August 1966 for subversive

activities allegedly directed against the Mexican government,

was in frequent contact with Subject in 1965-66.

They usually

simply arranged to see each other to discuss undisclosed

matters,

and Subject apparently called RICO from a pay phone

rather than from his office.

(Source: LIFEAT) (Subject has

apparently provided RICO with propaganda for news articles,

out they appear to have had other common interests as well

One

of which could well have been RICO's guerrilla activities.
