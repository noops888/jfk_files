During the meeting, Prio reported that he had been in contact

with high United States Government officials, and that although

they did not support the idea of a Cuban Government in Exile,

they promised they would not obstruct it.

Prio said that

Brazilian Foreign Minister Vasco Leitao da Cunha had stated that

it would be necessary to prepare the Brazilian people before

Brazil could support the Cuban Government in Exile.

he believes this is only an excuse by da Cunha not to carry out

the plan.

Eduardo Suarez, and Valentin Sanchez all spoke

out in support

resident of the Exile Govern

ment. They had urged a group consisting of Orlando Hanrique,

Orlando Puente, David Cabezas,

and Rafael Guas to support the

proposal.

Suarez stressed that now is the opportune soment to

carry out the campaign to form a Government in Exile since he

has been informed by

"reliable sources" that "the Americans"

Be it onto sit ban a 9, dot at roe its or

without "the Americans.

Dr. Enrique Huertas, the last speaker, opposed the idea of

appointing Prio as

President of the Government in Exile.

Huertas said the meeting had not been called for that purpose,

the persons attending the meeting had not had time to exchange

thoughts on the proposal, and they did not represent all pro-

ponents of a government in exile.

After various debates,

it

was agreed that two Commissions should be appointed as follows:

the first would write a manifesto explaining to the Cuban

exiles the importance of an exile government and ask for

support from all Cubans.

The members of this Commission are

Sergio Carbo, Eduardo Suarez, and Rafael Guas.

The second

commission was named the "Organizing Commission" and includes

Prio, Isabel Bequer, Juan M. Salvat, Huertas, Carlos Marquez,

Ramon Martin, and Alfredo Gonzalez.

It vas also

Oscara to offer Juanita Castro fuz a position on this Conmisston.

Government official who has traveled frequently throughout the

Caribbean and Central America,

where he maintains close friend-

ships with a wide range of military and political leaders.

Source is a rightist,

a trained reporter, and his information

has been fairly reliable in the past.

A meeting of the Organizing Commission was held on 15 March

1965 in the home of Alfredo Gonzalez at 2300 N.N.

Street, Miami.

All members of the Commission attended except

Gans and Marquez who were out of town, and Salvat who evidently.

does not agree with the group's proposed action. A document

prepared and approved by the group probably will not be

issued in the immediate future because Salvat informed Prio

that he would not sign it.

...6. The Commission discussed the following fornulas for selecting

a government in exile, but no agreement was reached on the

exact formula to be used.

1)

Submit to the exile community

a list of 50 names from which. 15 candidates receiving the

highest combined vote would be chosen.

The person receiving

the highest number of votes would be elected president and he

would form his government from the remaining 14 candidates;

2)

three candidates would be selected; the person receiving

the most votes among the three would form the government and

the other two would be his assistants;

3)

one candidate

would be chosen and he would be empowered to form his own

government.
