traveling with HEMMING to. Illinois in connection with the

negative.

45 Northwest 8th Street. Inquiry at the Imperial Hotel

failed to develop any indication that QUINTAS is or had

been residing there.

The records of the Immigration and Naturalization

Service (INS), Miami, Florida, do not contain any record

which could

be determined identical with QUINIAS on the

basis of available background information.

MM 639-S has been requested to obtain information

regarding the present whereabouts of QUINTAS, and he will

be promptly interviewed upon receipt of results of this

inquiry.
