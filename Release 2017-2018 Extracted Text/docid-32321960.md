Re:

(U) 62-HQ-1029205, 05/21/1997

(U) The FBI provided written justifications presenting

the evidence available to protect the individuals, singular

information,

and classified information related to sources and

foreign relations as listed above.

However, the ARRB supports

the position that the information ordered disclosed is relevant

and significant to the assassination.

They opine the pertinence

and importance to the assassination outweigh any current harm to

the individuals 'or the FBI's/United States Government's foreign

relations, intormants or operational aspects. At our request,

the ARRB agreed to reconsider their decision

on two of the 58

documents at their April meeting; therefore, they are not

addressed

in this memorandum.

(U) The JFKTF will continue to advise CID, NSD and OGC

of the ARRB decisions.

However, due to the narrowed

scope of

appeal issues, NSD and CID recommendations will only be sought

for significant matters, none of which are documented in this

memorandum.

If you have questions, please contact Pauline E.

Battle at extension 9299, Carol L.

Keeley at extension 9494, or
