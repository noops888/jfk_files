Dear Sir:

Enclosed please find a newspaper clipping

that

was sent to me anonymously. It arrived in my office today,

the

18th of April.

You will notice that there is some hand-

printing, and as far as I can make out it reads as follows:

"Could Norman Sinmlis, homme Ioronto, Ont., of

R.C.A. F. Wpeg. &lEastern Canada, and Mike ?

photographer R.C.A.F. have been in on this?

Simmlis was in Dallas that day, and spoke on

CBC from Toronto as an eye witness."

I have checked the name Norman Simmlis

through our Central Registry, but we have no record of him.

Yours truly,

G
