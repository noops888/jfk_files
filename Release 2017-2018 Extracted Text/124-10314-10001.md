Past experience has shown that contact with ACGM

associates on the part of visitors from the United States

is frequently of more than usual significance.: As the Bureau

is aware, the ACGM is not a formal organization and therefore,

has no "members". :'

The name American Communist Group in

Mexico (ACGM) is a term developed by informants of this office

several years ago to designate the American communists who had

for one reason or another left the United States and taken up

residence in Mexico. Those individuals were not merely

ordinary cell members of the CP USA prior to their arrival in

Mexico but occupied leadership positions in various

of the CP USA.

While in Mexico they have continued to main-

tain their communist-oriented ideology and firm desire to see

the government of the United States overthrown. The bifurcation

of: the communist movement in the United States resulting from

the development of the Chinese communist theories and programs,

as well as the development of the "New Left!

and the appearance

of militant black nationalism, is reflected among the associates

of the ACGM.

of the Soviets, the Chinese, the New Left and the militant

in the ch noge,

Although these individuals vary in their support

black nationalists, they still retain the common denominator

of dedication to the overthrow of the U. S. government.

Although not openly engaged in subversive activities in Mexico

in'order to avoid being expelled by the Mexican government,

they have continued to support subversive movements in the

United States by giving

both moral and financial support to those

subversive groups.

The ACGM is a very tightly knit group and coverage

as well as attempts to infiltrate informants into the group,

has shown that they accept on an equal basis only visitors

through failure to obtain proper recommendations is ostracized.

In view of the makeup of this group, coverage has

been concentrated largely on the principal figures who are

the ACGM who although "not as prominent as contact points are

nevertheless as selective in the political orientation of the

people they accept in their homes and with whom they freely

associate

Admittedly, coverage is not complete enough to

reveal all of the subversive statements and activities of

American visitors who are in contact with these ACGM

associates, but it is believed that their acceptance by the

established ACGM associates is a very good indication of the

political orientation of those visitors. Since the visiting

Alericans come from widely scattered parts of the United

States, this office is in no position

to evaluate their sub-

versive potential in the absence of prior correspondence from

the Bureau or the domestic field.

Whenever any information is

received which might assist in identifying the visitor or the

locale from which he or she originates in the U. S., this

office has furnished that information to the Bureau and the

interested field office for information and any action deemed

desirable.: Even though the limited coverage available to this

office in some cases does not reveal actual subversive

activities on the part of the visitors, the fact that they are

accepted as contacts by associates of the ACGM is sufficient

grounds, to alert the Bureau and the interested field offices

concerning the foreign travel of probable security subjects.

This office remains vigilant to fulfill the Bureau's

responsibilities in detecting and identifying potential couriers,

Espionage agents and individuals who might be operating in a

covert intelligence capacity.

To satisfy this responsibility,

logical sources are constantly reminded to remain alert to the

identification of individuals visiting Mexico and who contact

subjects of interest residing in Mexico. Because of the sub-

versive potential of ACGM associates and these visitors, it is

believed

that initial inquiries by the domestic office involved

desirable whenever possible

to determine the residence

and employment of the visitor and review records for previous

subversive activity.

light of information developed, the visitor represents a danger
