EPSTEIN and TANG-Ming-chao indicated that they are

"quite active and busy". They said that the CP of China has

prepared 13 articles which will be published in refutation of

articles concerning the Soviet-Chinese dispute appearing in

the Soviet press.

In reference to the above, it is to be noted that

it was reported on 5/21/59 by NY 1572-s that JAMES S.H. LEE,

current Editor of the "China Daily News", was very close and a

favorite of TANG Ming-chao.

It has been reported by NY 4047-s* that RICHARD and

SUSAN FRANK have had several contacts with JAMES and ANN LEE.*

no propose one lovement and oration

espouses the Chinese Communist cause.

NY 4047-S* has reported that the subject has been in

frequent contact with individuals in the U.S. who are pro-

Chinese Communist.

NY 4112-S* has reported that the subject has been in

contact with individuals in peking and with people abroad who

are believed to be pro-Chinese Communist.

Observations:

subject and her husband are engaged in activities on behalf of

the government of China and one of their intelligence targets

is the CPUSA, and in furtherance of this purpose it is believed

RICHARD FRANK met with TANG Ming-chao in London.

It is the observation of the NYo that the subject's

association with the LEEs and the China Daily News would furnish

a convenient means of communication between China and the FRANKS,

it being noted that CSNY 3333-S has furnished information to the

effect that the China Daily News receives current news releases

from the China News Service; the news

releases are from peking,

Shanghai and Canton.

Because of the extreme sensitiVity of the source

which furnished foregoing data, it cannot be furnished to the

British. Bureau recognizes that some reason must be given for

our interest in Perry, lanG and Epstein. Apparently, Kichar

rank was in contact with TANG and Epstein during his recen

trip to London, which was the subject of prior cormunications,

and therein you were instructed to request the British to cover

his activities while in Ingland. If this coverage disclosed

contacts with TANG and/or Epstein, this would provide a basis

" For sequentins the intensified coveredou can establishi

Richard Frank's connection with the Chinese by the fact that

-.. Richard and Susand Frank spent approximately a year and a half

.. in Communist China from the period 1959-60.

Under no circumstances are you to indicate to British

we have knowledge of Frank's contacts with Perry, TANG or

Epstein. If the British do not disclose knowledge of these

contacts, do not pursue the matter (s) New lork is currently

conducting intensive investigation of Susan and Richard Frank

and possibly may uncover another source with knowledge of

TANG-Epstein contacts.

NOTE:

The extremely sensitive source referred to in instant

letter is NY 694-5*.

Susan Frank and her husband, Richard, are suspected

of being agents for the Chinese Communists in the U. S., not

only by the Bureau but by CP, USA. It appears that liaison with

Chinese Communists is maintained through Israel Epstein and

TANG Ming-chao, who have headquarters in the office of a member

of British CP in London.

If we can persuade British to intensify

coverage of Individuals in London, possibility exists, we may

ultimately learn details de Chinese Communists activities in U. S_$)

NOTEFOR MAIL ROOM:

For mailing purposes, handle as
