Dear Mr. Lesar:

This acknowledges receipt of your letter of 11 June 1976

on behalf of Mr. Harold Weisberg requesting, under provisions

of the Freedom of Information Act, access to any. CIA records

dealing with Dr. Martin iuther King, Jr., and/or James Earl Ray

and any of his alleged or suspected

accomplices in DI. King's

assassination.

I shall arrange for a search of CIA files and shall be in

further comnunication with you once the search has been completed

and any records found reviewed for releasability under the Act.

As you may know, the heavy volume of Freedom of Infomation

requests received by the Agency has resulted in processing back-

logs.. If we do not respond within the 10 working days stipulated.

by the Act, it is your right to construe this as a denial, subject.

to appeal to the CIA Infornation Review Committee.. It would seem

more reasonable, however, for us to continue processing your request

and to respond as soon as feasible..

Any denials of records could

be appealed at that time. Unless we hear from you otherwise, we

will assume that this is agreeable to you and proceed on this basis.

For your information, I am enclosing a copy of our fee schedule.

if the charges seem likely to be considerable, I shall provide you

with an estinate and perhaps require a partial payment in advance

of processing.

Sincerely,

/ s/GFI!

December 3, 1976

Nic. Gene E. Wilson

Information and Privacy Coordinator

Central Intelligence Agency

Washington, D. C. 20505

Dear ME. Wilson:

,:-1

In response to your letter of November 30, 1976, Mr. Harold

Weisberg has authorized me to state his willingess to pay search.

and copying charges up to the amount of $1,000 if such charges are

required by his Freedom of Information Aci request for records

pertaining to DI. Martin Luther King, JI. and his assassination.

Because you require a down payment of half the anticipated charges,

I enclose a check for $500.00:

This payment of $500.00 and any subsequent payments made in

connection with this request are tendered with the express reserva

tion that Mr. Weisberg does not waive his right to recover them.

C.I.A. regulations provide:

Records shall be furnished without charge

or at a reduced rate whenever the coordina

tor determines that waiver or reduction of

the charge is in the public interest because

furnishing the information can be considered

21 PM '76

as primarily benefiting the general public.

The Coordinator also may waive or reduce the

charge whenever he determines that the inte-

rest of the government would be served there-

by. 32 C.F.R. $1900.25 (a).

In accordance with this regulation, I call upon you to

determine that it is in the public and governmental interest to

valve search and copying charges incurred in connection with Mr.

leisberg's request.

Enclosed herein is a copy of a letter to Deputy

Antoney General Harold R. Tyler, Jr. which makes a similar request

of the Department of Justice.

The reasons expressed in that letter

for granting a waiver are incorporated in my request that you grant

• waiver.

Should you require it, I will provide you with affidavits by

nurself, Mi. Weisberg, and others in support of this request fox

wiver of the search and copying charges for these records.

YOU

So wish supporting affidavits, I would appreciate it if you would

HH 53216 DocId:32397527 Page 9

## Page 10

inform me of this as soon as possible. I would also request

that you indicate what standards, if any, you have established

for determining whether or not a

request for waiver should be

granted.

You state that you can proceed no further with Mr. Weisberg's

request "unless and until we are in receipt of notarized state-

ments of release from Mrs. Coretta King and James Earl Ray,

respectively." Because Mr. Weisberg's request undoubtedly com-

prises records which do not involve any proper claim of privacy,

this cannot be true. I do enclose, however, a copy of a notarized

waiver by James Earl. Ray. " I will immediately contact Mrs. King

about a waiver by her.

in the meantime, I request that you procee

to make available those records responsive to Mr. Weisberg's re-

quest which do not involve any proper claim of invasion of privacy.

Sincerely yours,

Sanes #. Texas

It has been a very long tire since I have heard fron you about a multitude of requests

and inept. It's true that some of his earlier crimes

were ludicrously inept He couldn't pull a simple

holdup without running down a blind alley or losing

his shoes or dropping his wallet as he ran. But during

his seren years in the Missouri State Penitentiary, he

eridently matured as a eriminal: His escape from

there on April 23. 196 was well planned and well exe-

cuted. He somehow persuaded at least two men who

are still there to take the risks of aiding his escape.

Instead of being inept. Pay has become crafty.

The fifth misconception is that Ray could not

have supported himself and his trasels between April

23. 1967. and June &. 195k and therefore must bare

had financial assistance.

In Montreal about August 1, 1967, Ray held up

a food store and got £1,450. La reply to my written

queries, he first told me that he get this money by

holding up a whorehouse, and I pablished his account

of it. Then he toid me that it had really been a food

store, and that he told me it was a whorehouse be-

cause he didn't want a "hold waiting for him in

Canada when he got out of prison in Tennessee.

E TOLD ME many stories about a 30odd-year-

old French-Canadian or "Latin" named

"Piaoul" whom he met in Montreal, Ray said

be twice carried narcotics for him across the

border at Windsor-Detroit and was paid

$750. Then Raoul came to Birmingham and

gare bim $3.000 to buy the Mustang and

some camera equipment Later, according to Ray, he

met Raoul in New Orleans and in Laredo. There were

probably sereral Raouls accomplices of Ray in hold-

ups and other money crimes. Ray bought a large

re stores everywhere.

But there is nothing in Ray's beharior to indi-

cate, nor has he ever claimed that either he or Raoul

or arbody else got any money for the last big job he

was supposed to pull I beliere that Ray wanted to

murder Dr. King for reasons other than money.

Since Ray apparently got no money after the

murder, in seren mont's of dealing with him 1 wait-

ed for him to show some sion of feeling that he was

cheated, that he didn't get what he had been prom-

ised. Instead of bitterness or resentment. Ray has eri-

denced only an expanding self-satisfaction.

Ray seems to have spent about $12.00J between

April 23, 1957- and June & 1968. There were a num-

ber of unsoled robberies of banks, loan companies

and supermarkets in the areas through which Ray

mored. Getting that much money would hare been as

easy for him as killing Dr. King from 205 feet.

I can't prove that no one gate him money to kill

Dr. King. But I can prore that he could hare gotten it

in other hays.:

The sixth misconception is that Ray. haring

been in prison so much of his life, is not a "racist" or

"nigger-hater" and therefore coald have been moti-

rated only by money.

The record indicales to me that he is a "nigger-

hater," eren though be never eridenced this to Mr.

Hanes. On April 5. 195k Ray was released from the

Federal prison at Leatenworth. Kan_, with this item

in his report: ~On Septenber 12, 1957, be was ap-

proved for our Honor Farm but was never actually

transferred to the farm due to the fact that he did not

because they are integraled. He was therefore never

given Honor status. He was assigned to our bakery

where he has remained until his Conditional Release.

Bitter anti-Negro actions or remarks by Pay

were reported to me by persons who knew him in

Canada, Mexico and California

A serenth possible misconception is that Ray is

not a "killer" and is therefore probably incapable of

having killed Dr. King. It's true that there is no pre-

vious murder in his record. But in 1966, Ray was

given a thorough, six-weeks' psychiatric examination

at the Fulton (Missouri) State Hospital. He was diag-

nosed as a "sociopathic personality,

antisocial type

with anxiely and depressive features."

The superintendent of the hospital at Fullon is

Dr. D. B. Peterson. I asked him if James Earl Ray is

capable of planned killing for moncy.

"Certainly he is," replied the Doctor. "Any man

who commits armed robbery indicates that he inny

he willing to kill for gain if necessary. There is very

little dierence between armed robbery and planned

killing for moncy."

I then arked: "le Buy empable af killings in the

When the misconcepticne have beon dispelled, al

lenst partially, these questiong still remain:

Has there a conspirecy?

Well, there are largo conspiracies and little con.

apiracien. In large conspireles, rich and/or powerful

little men. Lund Detober, aller working with lay los

Yes, I think no. Remember that there are still i

And finally: Whae was Ray's real molivation?

this circumstance. On April 21, 1967, to days be.

bought a six-transistor Channel Master radio in the

prison commissary. He carried this radio with him

when he broko out, and listened over it for the an-

nouncement of his escape. He then carried it with hin

on all his travels and adventures for over a year.

After he shot Dr. King, Ray rushed down the

stairs, and threw the rifle on the sidewalk. Then, de-

Too Many Strikes Against L Tim

In the fall of 1935, little Jimmy Ray made his formal

debut in the outside world. He entered first grade at the

Ewing Consolidated School There was no school bus.

Jimmy walked the mile and a quarter; cutting across dusty

beanfields and cornfields, down through the shady back

streets of Ewing; through the hillside cemetery, across the

new highway and into the dirt schoolyard. He was smail,

blue-eyed, shy, the poorest of the poor, dressed in over-

alls and shabby tennis shoes with brown birder cord for

strings. But always clean. Lucille registered Jimmy &s

"James Rayns." (Later, when John Larry entered the

same school, he was registered as John Raynes.)

We The Ewing Consolidaied School was a wretched insti-

tution in a wretched time and place. There were 50 ic 60

students crowded into three "basement" rooms (the upper

portion of the school was yet to be built). The first and

second grades shared a room. The third through ffth

shared another. The sixth through eighth shared the last

There were half a dozen teachers. School hours were from

9:00 to 4:30 with a break for lunch at midday, always

preceded by a prayer of thanksgiving offered by a volun-

teer" student. For those students who could not aford

a nickel, including Jimmy Ray, the lunches were free.

There was no organized recreation Absenteeism was high

among the student body. Students were needed at home

for chores. Their parents were not obsessed by the need

to educate the children. It was often too cold to walk to

One can well imagine that Jimmy Ray was bewildered

by his first contact with books and formal teaching He

was, in the current jargon, a truly deprived child. It is

doubtful that a book of any kind had ever entered his

home. Miss Ina Kitson, who still teaches at the school; re-

members Jimmy Rayns quite well. "He was just precious,"

she recalls. "He always played up to me, always came m

THE STRANGE CASE OF JAMES EARL RAY.

Although circumstances of his environment placed him

in a deprived category, denied him recognition, Jimmy Ray

did not give up easily. The denial, the twinges of adversity

and stern compression of circumstances had, perhaps, im-

bued him with a mysterious "ruthless fixity of purpose and

tenacious mother-wit," which, as Winston Churchill writes,

drive men to unusual endeavor. On February 14, when he

and his classmates exchanged Valentines, Jimmy appeared

with a handmade card that surcly took him many paticnt

hours to create. When classmate Brown came down with

polio, Jimmy carricd his books for him. Jimmy was so

anxious to star in the sandlot football games that he broke

his leg carrying the; football into a line of much larger and

tougher boys. He worried to his teacher, Virgil Graves,

that the other kids might make fun of his clothes.

At home there was little inspiration for Jimmy Ray, His

mother, now burdened with two more infants, both girls,

Melhn, born in 1938, and Carol Jenn, born in 1941, hnd

succumbed to that fatal Trish weakness, drink, Sho also

smoked-on the sly. She despaired of religion. "There was

no Christianity in that house," Charlic Pércock reclis.

"Nothing in help them over the rough spots." To get Are-

Instead, Jimmy went to Alton, to live with his Grandmother

mother and father, the numbing poverty, the lack of pride;

ambition, The tenacious mother-wit had taken hold. Jimmy

Ray would make something of himself, lind that hord-

sought recognition, That fall he went to work in the tunning

factory of the International Shoe Company, carning 776

Horatio Alger. Always neat in appearnnee, he arrived at

the factory promptly for work. He literally slaved for his

moncy-sweeping floors, shoving cavy stock in tho

shipping room, going about his work with quict compe;

the frec-enterprise system. Hc was clean, honest, frugal

young nephew's frugality. He did not smoke or drink. The

his "younger brother, John Larry;

Maher sometimes took him to St. Louis to watch the

Browns play: "He loved baseball," Maher recalls, "just like

any other boy. He used to go down to the neighborhood

field and play baseball with the other boys. He was a pretty

good shortstop, But you'd never see him banging around

on the corner with any of them." eac

Ray worked diligently for two years, 1944 to 1945. Then

came a shock. Business at International Shoe fell off

sharply, perhaps because of a cutbuck in defense orders.

Jiminy Ray was laid off, It was not due to incompetenco,

for lack of ambition or willingness to work. He was a vic-

tim of circumstances. The older men with seniority had

first claim on the remaining jobs. a

19%.

There is no evidence that Ray was embittered. On the

contrury, after putting in his last day in December, 1945,

he promptly made plans to join the army. He was not yot

18, he could volunteer for induction and choose between

Europe and the Pacific for his duty station, A few weeks

later, on February 19, 1946, he went down to East St.

Louis and enlisted. He picked Europe specifically Ger-

many for his ultimate duty station. At the tannery, Ray

had met a German emigré who had kindled his curiosity

about the country and its people. The young boy, in fact,

admired all things German: Ray left $1,180 tucked away

in his Alton savings account, more money than his father

had accumulated in a lifetime.

After basic training at Camp Crowder, Missouri, Ray

was shipped off for duty in Europe. The war was over

now. The infantry had done its job. The elite corps of the

Occupation force was the military police: In wartime, they

were little more than traffic cops, directing convoys toward

the action. Now they were the symbol of authority, hated

and respected with equal intensity. James Earl Ray was

selected for the military police and assigned to the 382nd

Mp's ore toll, robust, assertive, men with imposing phy-

siques and communding voices; priding theiselves on their

military, bearing, and jaunty uniforms. It is dillicult. to

imagine James Earl Ray in such an outfit. He was very

small, like his father, He was shy-painfully shy. He

rarely spoke unless spoken to. His posture, his bearing,

his general physical appearance was the antithesis of the

MP. He slouched to the side when he sat down. He walked:

in a curious, loping, uncoordinated way, sort of a clod;

hopper shuffle. He found difficulty in looking a man di

rectly in the eye...s

Ray was an MP. for about a ycar and a half, a jeep

driver in Nürnberg. He went about his work quietly and

proficiently. He regularly sent olf posteards lo members

of the family= Uncle Bill Maher, Aunt Mubel, others:

He sent most of his puy home-to savings, or to his

father, who had been laid off from his rairoad job anc

now lived in a sleazy house in "the Line" in Quincy. There

is no evidence of trouble, no disciplinary action in the

MP battalion. On the contrary, all signs point to a well-

adjusted young soldier, proud of his status, thrilly, sober;

celibate. He was on his way to rising ubove his environ-

ment.

Then something happened. What, exactly, has never

been revealed. In April, 1948, Ray was abruptly drumnied

out of the MP's, transferred from the elite corps to the

regular infantry-Company B, 16th Regiment. It may

have been that some new captain or lieutenant, seeing

Ray in the barracks or behind the wheel of his jcep. took

exception to his military bearing, perhaps asked: "What's

that hillbilly doing in my outfit? Get rid of him."

There seems little doubt that the transfer came as a

stinging rebuke. It was another wound, a painful rejection

that embittered Ray with the army and all it stood for.

From that moment on, as he said later, he was determined

to get out as fast as possible. The fastest perhaps only-:

way out in those days was to provoke some disciplinary

action. 1309 ey

THE STRANGE CASE OF JAMES EARL RAY

Gerry Ray, now 18, a dark, extroverted character,

chatty and popular with girls, was only a few steps behind

his older brothers;. On the afterioon of February 1, 1954,

, Gerry and three other boys-were riding around in a car

in Quincy. A plot was hatched. They parked the car on

7th Street between Kentucky and State.: Gerry and a boy

named Mickey Walker got out of the car and walked to

8th Street, Just opposite the State Theater, Gerry and

Mickey saw Mr. and Mrs. Edgar Schaefer walking along

the sidewalk. Gerry ran by the couple, grabbing Mrs.

Schaefer's purse. Mickey: bumped: Mr. Schaefer, throwing

him off balance. Then the two: boys ran back to the car.

They drove down to the riverfront. The four boys divided

the money in the purse. $85 and then burned the purse.

The boys were caught. Gerry was charged with grand

larceny. He sought probation, but it was denied because

of his previous record. At the trial on February 24, 1954,

Judge Fred G. Wolfe senterced Gerry to Menard to serve

a minimum of two years and a maximum of five years.

He entered prison as Gerald Ryan: In the year 1954, then,

The night of August 27, 1954 a Saturday-was warm

and rainy. In East Alton, a small town adjacent to Alton,

a "merchant policeman"= a private cop hired by the own-

ers of the shops and stores named Andrew Biro made

his rounds by car, peering into store windows in the busi

ress section to be sure all was well. Tony Biro, the father

of nine children, was a small, scrappy man, dark, alert;

a zealous cop with uncanny eyes who took himself and

his job very seriously. That night Biro had a companion:

Chaten Greenwood, an East Alton policeman. Shortly after

am, as they were cruising along Ponce Street near the

riaduct, they passed the National Cleaners, a one-story

esiablishment faced with fieldstone. Through the drizzle;

In the Deep South, according to Rife, James Earl Ray

expressed a deep-seated hatred for black people. "He was

prejudiced to the point that he hated to see a colored per-

son breathe," Rife says. "You could gather from his con-

versation that if it was up to him, there wouldn't be any

colored people. They would either be shipped back to

Africa or disposed of in some way.".

In Florida, Walter Rife became enchanted with an auto-

mobile on a used-car lot, a maroon 1949 Lincoln. Rife,:

pockets bulging with cash, dickered. He and the salesman

were only a few dollars apart when Ray, to Rife's amaze-

ment, offered to throw his car in on the deal as a trade.

"I don't know what 'possessed him to do it,". Rife says.

"Ordinarily he was so chintzy. The only thing I can figure

is he didn't want to drive back north by himself."

The two men headed home. In Florida, Ray passed a

S50, money order, signing the name Willard McBride. In

Hot Springs, Arkansas, on March 20, he cashed a $75

money order addressed to McBride at the Askay Art Gal-

Teries. And another for $75 at the Biles Music Company.

And another at Dino's Store for men. Rife passed three

$75. money orders at Brown's Department Store, Pfeiffers

and Charles Weaver's. They headed for Kansas City. But

the postal inspectors, following their trail from the cards

rejected by the computer, were drawing the noose tight.

f On March 21; a blizzard was raging in Kansas City. Ray

made his way to Askins, a men's clothing store. The man-

ager, Joe Isaacson, fitted Ray with a new suit of clothes.

Ray paid with a postal money order. Ray returned to his

hotel, saying he would call for the suit later. The credit

manager in Askins was suspicious of the money order. He

telephoned the postal inspectors. An inspector was on the

The most important of these is "I.D."- some form of iden

unication. America is a land of identification cards: driver's

license, social security card, draft card, credit cards, birth

suficates. Without these, or one of these, it is difficult

ora man. to move about, to get a job, of to apply for pass

ports and other official papers. ras

alias and number Huie says he remembered from around

was using that or any alias in 1951). It is remarkable

that he could remember a nine-digit number after 16 years:

The Indian Trail is a family-style restaurant in the fash-

It specializes in

impressive business. It has been operated by friendly,

home-folk owners, Clara and Harvey: Klingeman, and

Clara's sister Elly, for about 35 years. In May, 1967, the

Enter now, another mystery about Ray's finances., Ray

told Huie that he only had $70 left after paying his room

and board at the Har-K rooming house. That was on the

afternoon of July 18. Yet on the very next day, July 19;

Ray appeared at the Tip Top Tailors to splurge money on

fancy new clothes. A salesman, I B. Cloutien, fitted him

for a new powder-blue Botany suit. He also bought gray

slacks, a red T-shirt, a yellow T-shirt, yellow swim trunks,

red pajamas, socks, underwear and neckties. In all, about

$200 worth. Two days later he appeared at yet another

haberdasher, English and Cottonwood Limited. A sales

man, Edward John Feisin, fitted Ray for yet another suit

This suit, when completed, was mailed to Ray in Ala

According to the Ray-Huie account, Ray paid for these

he spent $25 casing the establishment one night, then

robbed it the next. If he cased it at the first possible oppor-

robbed it on July 19: But he arrived at Tip Top Tailors

Then, about a week later July 31- Ray did an amazing

thing for a man so desperate for cash. He took off for a

week: of luxurious loafing in a posh Laurentian resort

The room alone cost him $153. He must have spent at

least another $20 a day on drinks and entertainment. Al-

and later, there were two Ray-Galts). Many believe that

the transformation could not have occurred on the spur

of the moment. That it was the first step in a long, well

thought-out plan to create a fictitious identity, a part of

which was the selection of the name Galt itself. If so, then

Ray must have conceived the new identity in Jefi City, or

shortly after his escape. Those who believe this alsó be

of this speculation lends weight, of course, to the theory

that Ray had money stashed away and was acting alone,

executing an exotic plan conceived behind bars. 7: 12 €

By his own admission, Ray-Galt was not yet recruiter

Ray, in fact, left the cultivated girl behind in the Lauren-

brother" in Montreal. He had told her the night before

that he "worked for" his brother "in some kind of busi-

ness" and that the old red Plymouth was his brother's

wife's car-a jalopy for hauling groceries. So far as is

known, it was the first time Ray mentioned to anyone that

he had a brother, of that he had business with a brother.

In the coming months, Ray would mention three times

again that he was embarked on this or that enterprise with

a "brother." Partly on the basis of these statements, the

initial FBI indictment against Ray also mentioned a "broth

er." Did Ray mean John Larry, who visited him the day

before he escaped from Jeff City? Of Gerry, who lived so

close by when Ray worked-as John L. Rayns in the

Indian Trail in Winnetka? Or was it merely a small lie?

In any case, neither brother has been formally charged in

the case.

Back in Montreal, Ray told Huie, it was not his brother

but "Raoul" he was rushing to meet. Raoul if there was

a Raoul-may have resembled John Larry. He was about

John Larry's age-35 or 36 and was. like John Larry,

blond. (The name Raoul, French or Spanish for Ralph,

is not far from Ray.) In the coming months, Ray-Galt

Puerto Vallarta, a posh, offbeat little jet-set hangout north

of Acapulco.0

On the night of October 19; 12 days after leaving Bir-

mingham, he checked into the Rio Hotel He gave his ad-

dress as the Economy Grill and Rooms. He signed the

register in his unmistakable hand, "Eric Galt" He re-

mained at the Rio for 19 days; then shifted to another

hotel, right on the beach, the Tropicana, where he stopped

another week- until November 13. The hotel employees

recall him only vaguely. He was "quiet."" He kept company

with prostitutes, but in contrast to Canada there was no

white-hot intimate affair with a "cultivated" mystery wom-

an: Someone remembered him saying, "After I make a big

score, I'm gonna come down here and live on beer and

beans." Ray-Galt was just one more rich noreamericano

tourist, basking in the sun, haunting the bars at night, liv-

ing the life of the superrich. But no one remembers him

as an avid photographer-with expensive equipment The

employees remember only the white Mustang. Someone-

perhaps Ray-Galt of one of his girl friends glued two

Mexican turista stickers on the side window of the car.

Or was he merely a simple tourist? He may not have

been. Investigative authorities in Memphis have said that

during his stay in Mexico, Ray was engaged in smuggling,

as he had been in Canada. In Mexico, they say, Ray picked

up contraband jewelry and smuggled it across the border;

to a person, or persons, unknown. De

Ray-Galt now drove north to Los Angeles. Why? An-

other mystery. He told Huie he went there to try to find a

job on a ship just in case Raoul didn't come through? In

What was the purpose of this letter? Was it a ruse

meant to be discovered at some later date, a red herring

to deflect investigators in the direction of Rhodesia in

pursuit of the fictional Eric Galt? Or was it earnestly meant?

If it was earnestly meant, if Ray-Galt was seriously inquir-

ing about ways and means to emigrate to Rhodesia with-

out a passport, then why? The mysterious Latin, Raoul,

had repeatedly promised Ray-Galt ID. and money to go

anywhere in the word, including a passport. Did Ray-

Galt fear Raoul might renege on that part of the deal?

Was he hedging his bets? Seeking an alternate escape tun

nel he could use without a passport in case Raoul failed,

to come through? Or was there no Raoul, and was the

lone wolf preparing his own escape route? 2th

Whatever the reason, the response was not encouraging.

The Council mailed Ray-Galt a routine reply, stating that

it did not handle such inquiries. The Council, which repre

sents five African nations, was organized primarily to pru

mote tourism, or so it claims. 5906/2206503

After mailing off the letter, Ray-Galt abruptly changed

his living quarters. From Serrano Avenue he moved to

the St Francis Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard, above the

Sultan Bar. The SL Francis is not a fleabag. It is an old

rundown establishment with worn carpeting and an elderly

clientele, including many permanent residents. Ray-Gat

THE STRANGE CASE OF JAMES EARL RAY

Canadian girl he had been working for his brother. In

Birmingham he was an ex-shipyard worker on vacation:

On his Alabama driver's license application he was "Mer-

chant Marine." All fictitious, and for good reason. Find-

ing employment in America for a fictitious character is not

easy. Employers ask for references, employment records;

social security card, other identification. They withhold

income taxes. They send records to Washington.

Ray-Galt made a stab. He ran an ad in the Los Angeles

Times offering himself as a "culinary." He had a social-

security number-the one he had given to Mrs. Klingeman

at the Indian Trail in Winnetka. It was a "safe" number;

he had used it before. (At Social Security headquarters, the

number is the only thing that matters. As an official says:

"People change their names all the time. We couldn't keep

track of that.") Ray-Galt received three job offers. But

each employer asked for references and a social-security

card. Ray-Galt could not supply these. He was turned

away..

In another country-Latin America, Rhodesia-he

would not need these annoying papers and numbers. But

he would need a skill. As a well-dressed American abroad,

he could not very well list his only previous experience as

"dishwasher" or "culinary." Where would a dishwasher

get money to go abroad? It would arouse immediate sus

picion, perhaps bring an investigation. But where could

Ray-Galt acquire a skill in a short time? Something that

would not be demeaning or arouse undue notice? The

answer. he would become a bartender. He could learn

that trade in less than two

months. Bartenders make

enough money to travel abroad. They are a kind of restless,

international breed, shifting from one country to another.

It was a perfect long-term cover, not apt to ever arouse

suspicion.

One of the bartenders. in the Sultan Room; Gil Martin,

says he gave Ray-Galt the idea. But Ray-Galt may have

had the idea earlier and merely asked certain questions,

giving Martin the impression it had been his idea. Ray's

brother John Larry had taken a bartender course, and had

worked as a bartender in New York, and later at his sister

Carol Jean's place in St. Louis, the Grapevine. So, as Ray

häd earlier chosen his brother's name for an alias, his age,

his love of vodka and orange juice, he now chose his trade.

On January 19, Ray-Galt appeared at the International

School of Bartending on Sunset Boulevard, not far from

the St. Francis Hotel by Los Angeles standards. The school

was not impressive from the outside. Except for the sign

on the front, it might have been taken for a store in an

ordinary neighborhood. It was not even a permanent lo-

cation: by the following summer it would have moved to

Alvarado Street. tr

Inside, the school looked very much like a cocktail

lounge. There was a long "training" bar, sleekly modern, a

few small tables, soft lights, heavy carpet. Behind the bar

were dozens of whiskey bottles-filled with water- and a

vast variety of highball, liquor and cocktail glasses. Pre-

siding over the "school" was the "director,.

" a genial Latin

named Tomas Reyes Lau, Lau was a dapper, very precise

man; with swarthy skin, dark eyes, sharply trimmed mous-

tache, given to alligator shoes and corduroy trousers and

sports jackets.

Lau invited Ray-Galt into the small "oflice." He showed

him the elaborate "course book" (nuthorized by law) and

explained that by "graduation" time, six weeks hence;

Ray-Galt would know how to mix 110 different drinks.

He would also be taught poise, style, personality improve-

ment, confidence, coordination, balance, hygiene and psy

chology-presumably how to be a sympathetic listener;

or how to evict a noisy drunk without traumatizing him or

other bar patrons. "Students" at the school would work

behind the bar three to six hours a day, be "graded" in

a dozen categories At "graduation" Ray-Galt would re-

ceive a diploma and have his picture taken in a tuxedo

jacket and formal shirt and black tie. There were many

pictures of former graduates tacked on the wall. The fee

was $220:

Ray-Galt gave Lau the impression that he was "desper-

ate" to get a job and go to work as soon as possible. He

gave Lau the $220 fee in cash. He filled out an application

blank, giving his address as the St. Francis Hotel He gave

Franklin Avenue, He listed a "Mr. Weller" of 741 S.

Figueroa Street as a former employer who had paid him

$50 a week. Although he had passed himself off as "des.

perate" for a job, it is certain that Ray-Galt never intended

to apply for a job as a bartender in America upon gradua-

tion. He knew the problem of the social-security card, the

references, the employment record. More important: in

many cities, including Los Angcles, bartenders are re-

quired to register with police when they take a job dis-

pensing liquor. Often, applicants/ are fingerprinted and

investigated by police departments. That was a risk Ray-

Galt could not afford.

in!.

* Journalist Louis Lomax believes that at about this time:

Ray-Galt made another whirlwind trip to New Orleans and

vicinity. Lomax says that on Valentine's Day, February 14,

Ray-Galt swapped his console TV with a girl in return for

her portable i, and during this transaction Ray-Galt told

her he was "leaving town." Lomax (who claims to have

found the girl) believes that Ray-Galt then drove to New

Orlans and delivered a package to a family there from

their daughter in Los Angeles. Afterward, Ray-Galt drove

to Birmingham. In that city, Ray-Galt bought gas and

reccived Grccn Stamps, proof of the trip. c

Beyond Lomax's speculation, there is no further evi-

dence that Ray-Galt made a trip to New Orleans in mid-

February. Ray himself mnkes no mention of it in his ne;

count to' Hulo. The Green Stamps do not provo ho was

Rny-Onlt could have acquired them the previous Scptem

ber when he lived in Birmingham. If he mado tho trip, họ

would have missed classes at the bartending school, pers

hips too many to "gradunte." Besides that, he was busy

on nother of his purposcful projects. st

On Februhry 19, in Los Ángeles, Ray-Galt visited a

plastic surgeon, Dr Russel C. Hadley: Ray-Galt was. con

corned about two prominent physical features that might

conccivably draw attention to him especially in a photo

graph. One was the little tip on the end of his nose. The

other was tho drooping left car lobe. In Hadley's office,

likeness ends there. One reason may be that Ray-Gait had

his eyes firmly closed n0 doubt deliberately-when the

shutter clicked. Without eyes, a face like Ray's could

resemble millions of others.

Lau informed Ray Galt that he had lined up a bartend-

ing job. But the Ray-Galt who had given the impression he

was "desperate" for work six weeks earlier declined. "I

have to leave to see my brother," Ray-Galt said. "What

good would it do for me to work for only two of three

weeks? Id better wait until I return to town and get a

permanent job.".. When Ray-Galt telephoned Lau a week

later on some routine matter, Lau again offered him a job.

Again, Ray-Galt declined Amonded

Was Ray-Galt, in fact, off to see a "brother"? No one

knows. But interestingly it was the second time Ray-Galt

had used seeing a brother as an excuse to terminate a

relationship and shift the scene of his operation

About this time, an incident occurred in Alabama that

would later assume a curious aspect, another minor- or

perhaps important mystery in the unfolding drama. On

about the last day in February, according to Captain T. L.

Payne of the Alabama Highway Patrol, someone identify-

ing himself as Eric S. Galt telephoned the license division

requesting a duplicate driver's license. The duplicate was

mailed to Galt, together with a bill for 254, on March 1, to

the Economy Grill and Rooms in Birmingham. There, ac-

cording to manager Peter Cherpes, the duplicate license

was picked off the front hall table, by a person unseen and

therefore unknown, on or about March 2 or 3. The license

division received the 25¢ payment on March 6.4c

The incident cannot be dismissed lightly. It is the only

proof that Ray-Galt may have had an accomplice in his

enterprise. Conceivably, Ray-Galt could have telephoned

long distance requesting the duplicate. But he could not

have picked it up at the Economy Grill and Rooms on

March 2 or.3. On March 2, he was in Los Angeles, "gradu-

ating." On March 5, he had his nose operated on. He

visited Dr. Hadley for postoperative treatment on March

17 and March 11:

THE STRANGE CASE OR JAMES BARL RAY

was called upon to denl with another protest movement,

the garbage strike in Memphis. 'The doublo there had begun

two months before, in February. The city's 1,300 garbage

collectors, 90% Negro, had petitioned the Mayor, Henry

Locb, for a modest wage and compensation increase. Loch

stubbornly refused. The garbage collectors struck. Tempers

flared; no mediation seemed possible. The collectors sent

an appeal to King: come and help dramatize the impasse.

King responded to the call reluctantly,

On March 17, the day Ray left Los Angeles, King was

the principal speaker at the important California Demo-

cratic convention in Los Angeles. 'The next day he flew to

Memphis. Then he went to Atlanta. On March 20, he was

in Mississippi. Then Alabama. Then Atlanta. On March

28, he was back in Memphis; to lead the protest march.

The march erupted in violence. In the melee men were

killed. His nonviolent philosophy, his leadership of the

black community were on trial.

He remained in Memphis March 29, returning to Atlanta

on March 30. On April 1, he was in Washington, where ho

gave a moving address to 3,000 people; mostly white, in

the. Washington Cathedral. He had made public his inten-

tion to lead a second march in Memphis on April 6:

On March 29, while King was in Memphis, James Earl

Ray appeared in the Aero Marine Supply. Company, a

sporting-goods store near the main entrance of the Bir-

mingham airport. There, using the name Harvey Low-

meyer, with a Birmingham address, Ray purchased a 243-

calber Winchester: rifle with a Redfield telescopic sight

from salesman U. L. Baker. A customer, John De Shazo;

observed the purchase. Why he shifted to yet another alias

has not been revealed. The Birmingham address was false.

It was part of the plan, perhaps.

That afternoon, Ray-Lowmeyer telephoned the Aero

Marine Supply Company. He spoke to another salesman,

Donald F. Wood. Ray-Lowmeyer said he had talked with

"his brother" and wanted to exchange the rifle for another.

Ray-Lowmeyer left the impression he was "going deer

hunting in Wisconsin with a brother or brother-in-law." It

wäs the third time Ray had mentioned a "brother" in pub-

lic. Ray-Lowmeyer wanted to exchange the rifle for a larger

caliber, a 30.06. Wood said,

"Fine, bring the other rifle in

DooId:32397527 Page 95

THE STRANGE CASE OF JAMES BARL RAY 111

ut nino o'clock in the morning." Ruy-Lowmeyer did, and

picked up a Remington at three that afternoon. Tho Rem-

Ington was a Model 760 Gamemaster Pump Action 30.06;

serial number 461476. Wood shilled the Redfield sight

(serial number 17350) to the new rifle. With the sight

attached, the rifle would not fit in its regular box. So Wood

put it in a Browning automatic shotgun box, and Scotcli-

tuped it closed. The final bill was $150, which Ray-Low-

meyer paid in cash.

Why had Ray exchanged rifles? He had apparently al-

ready bought at least six heavy dumdum-type bullets else-

where. These bullets could not be fired in the Winchester

without mechanically filing the rim of the firing pin so it

would make contact with the cartridge cap. It was easier to

exchange rides.

Ray then retumed directly to Atlanta. On the day after

he got the Remington, March 31, he paid Garner another

week's rent. At that time, Ray wrote his namc Eric S.

Galt—on an envelope. Either at this time, or five days later,

Ray-Galt left Garner a note saying he had to return to

Birmingham, and would be back later for the television

and other personal effects. He may have left his note in

the envelope bearing his name. On the envelope, he left a

fingerprint.

The next day, April 1, Ray took some laundry to the

Piedmont Laundry around the corner from Jimmy Garner's

rooming house. He left it in the name of Eric S. Galt with

a clerk, Mrs. Annie Peters. Then he turned the Mustang

westward, toward Memphis. On the night of April 2, he

spent the night in a motel in Mississippi, registered in the

name: of Eric S. Galt. The next day, April 3, Ray-Galt

stopped at the Rexall Drug Store in Whitehaven, Tennes-

see, and bought some toilet articles, including a bottle of

after-shave lotion.

That same morning, Dr. King arrived at the Eastern Air

Line sheep run at the Atlanta airport to catch a plane for

Memphis. There, Eastern officials informed him the flight

lad been delayed: rumor had it that someone had planted

a bomb on the plane. King and his associates sat in the

desegregated waiting room while the plane was searched.

King was not alarmed, merely wildly annoyed by the delay,

He had come to accept threats to his life as routine. "For

the heat full blast. On the same day the fingerprints wer

matched; the FBI released Ray's name; record and oi

data, including a precise physical description, and a galley

of photographs those taken at the time of his previou

arrests. On the following day, beneath banner headling

Ray's photograph was published on the front page of mos

of the major newspapers. Reporters set to work digeng

into his past, stitching together the threads of the Ray

family and its history, manfully grappling with the b

wildering variety of names-Ray, Ryan, Raya, Raymes,

Raines— the many children..a

So did the FBI. The focus.of the manhunt now shifted

to the Midwest. Suspicion fell on Gerry and John Larry as

possible accomplices. The St. Louis FBI office became the

command post in this new search: the lights burned all

night in the Federal Building. Agents scurried in and out

at all hours with scraps of information, compiling an ex-

haustive biography of Ray, his family, his cohorts, his past

accomplices. It was hoped that from this mass of informa

tion a clear picture of Ray the man and his habits would

emerge, and thus lead them to his probable hiding place.

-While this hunt was in progress, the Bureau also alerted

Mexican authorities and the Royal Canadian Mounted

Police. Ray had visited both those countries since his

escape from Jeff: City and prior to the assassination. He

might have returned to either. disea

The FBI found Gerry Ray working as a maintenance

man at a country club in suburban Chicago. Not long after-

ward, enterprising Chicago reporters also found Gerry Rar

Gerry probably told both FBI agents, who fully cleare

him, and reporters the same story. He said that the lat

contact he had had with James Earl Ray was a letter—

addressed to Gerry's Wheeling, Illinois, post-office box-

a week before James escaped from Jeff City: James had

made no effort to contact any members of the family since

his escape.sas0150269252

SER2/24

"He won't contact anybody in the family," Gerry said

"I'm sure of that. The FBI will be watching all of as."

Gerry was one of those who believed that James was

probably part of a "giant" conspiracy. He thought his

brother had been "used" in some way, probably as the

"fall guy" and not the killer. "If he did it, which I doubt,"

THE STRANGE CASE OF JAMES EARL RAY

The night clerk Luis remembers Ray as "quiet, lonely a

shy. He never talked to us nothing more than ed

phone calls or talked to any of the other guests." Thr dr

clerk, João, says: "He was a timid guy, always wait

and consorting with prostitutes in the Galo, Boh mia. Ritz

One recalls: He sat in the corner, alone. drinking beti.

But he didn't want to talk." In all these places. Ray ate

and drank sparingly and tipped niggardly. One dark-haired

girl, a pretty fixture in the Texas Bar, admits to having

gone to bed with Ray. "He didn't have much money on

him," she says. "He didn't talk about himself He wouldn't

even tell me what ship he came from.". During the irysi.

Ray asked if she had childr-n. She showed him pi tures of

them-all fatherless at which point. she recalls, Ray was

sad, and almost wept. Frugal in all things, Ray even

about $10 instead of her usual price of $17 50 for a hali

Ray did not "lose" his passport in Lisbon.

He had

something better going for him. His passport contained a

typographical error. The surname "Sneyd" was spelled

"Sneya." On May 15, Ray went to the emigration section

of the Canadian Embassy and was waited on by Mrs.

Manuela Texieira Lopes. A Canadian consular official

says: "He came into the consulate and said that his name

had been misspelled on the passport-that it should have

SHE STRANGE CASE OF JAMES EARL RAY

$203

Before leaving the New Earl's Court Hotel, Ray had

are to a street callbox, and, out of the blue, telephoned

in Colvin an editonal writer and African authority or

Daly Telegraph newspaper. As Mr. Colvin recalls the

orate conversation, Kay, identitying himself as Ramon

Snyd and speaking in a high sing song voice, perhaps to

sguise his southern accent, said: Tm a Canadian in

London for a while. I'm trying to reach my brother who

swith these people in Angola." Ray implied that his

brother had, enlisted with the mercenaries based in Portu-

guese Angola who were operating against the Congo. Did

Colvin know how he, Ray, might get in touch with Major

Alistair Wicks, a Britisher who was known to have been a

mercenary recruiter? (On May 19, two days after Ray's

amrival in London, Major Wicks had been prominently

leatured in London newspapers some of the articles by

Colvin, where his role in the Congo operation and more:

recently, Biafra was described at some length.) AS764vg

It was the fourth time Ray had referred to "a brother"

public!

1S610

Colvin did not know what to make of this stranger and

his urgent request. He was busy meeting a deadline. But

Ray pressed, asking for Wicks' telephone number. Partly

to get nid of Ray, Colvin said he would try to reach Wicks

and pass along Ray's message. But Colvin refused to give

Ray Wicks number.

L242 40029

That was Tuesday. On Thursday, Ray, now at the Pax

Hotel, called Colvin a second time. Ray, according to

Colvin, was speaking "a torrent of words" and there

seemed to be greater desperation in his high-pitched voice

Colvin asked if Ray had heard from Wicks. No, Ray said

sheepishly. Perhaps because he, Ray, had changed hotels

"Nobody seems able to help," Ray kept saying.n1

What about the Canadian Embassy?" Colvin said.

Well, they are just no help to me at all," Ray said.

If your brother is missing, someone will help you,? re

plied Colvin. "Why don't you try the consular section of

the British Foreign Ofice?"

Well it's not so much my brother's missing," Ray said,

Shitting ground.

"I just haven't heard from him in four

months, Fact is, I'd like to join him and be a mercenary

myself.":

Huie knows that the Ray assignment

it will be his last. He would prefer to

the Klan, the other way by his better in-

that movies will be made of some of

his civil rights books. "One of the great

tragedies is that we've never had real-

ROBERTI ALLEN PAUL SCOTT

Clues To Assassination

WASHINGTON - The Federal Bureau of Investigation's massive

probe of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King is taking a possibly

sensational turn.

With James Earl Ray, the suspected assassin, apparently either

outside the U. S. or now dead, FBI agents have increased their surveil.

Tance of several American Communists known to have been closely asso-

cialed with King, including one wiu wrote speeches for him in the past.

This new development was unggered by evidence gathered by the

more than 1,000 agents who have worked on the mysterious King shoot-

ing and by several "tips" and letters sent to the FBI.

One of the most interesting of these "tips" came from an alert TV

viewer and concerns the now famous "Mountain Top" speech King made

on April 3, the night before his slaying, showing a premonition of his im-

pending death.

"If the speech was truly made in Memphis on April 3 as reported,"

the letter pointed out, then how can one account for King stating his age

as 36 (instead of 39) and why does he speak of demonstrating in Alabama

twice during the speech?"

UNANSIERED QUESTIONS

After checking out the time and location of King's final speech;

several of the crack FBI agents assigned to the case decided to begin

seeking answers to a number of their own questions, ircluding:

"If King had personally written that speech, why would he make

mistases like those contained in it-especially the one involving his age?"

"If the speech was written by someone other than King, who was

the author and when was it written?"

5 448

The answers to these questions are considered highly important to

the investigation; since, if another person was concerned in the prepara

tion of that speech, the writer might be able to shed new light on it -

especially those mistakes.

Aiso, if King had received help with the speech, the passages deai-

ing with the civil rights leader's premonition of death would probably

have been fully discussed. King's request to the Detroit police depart-

ment for protection when he visited that city a few weeks before his

death indicated he feared for his life then.

niormation gathered by the FBI on King, prior to his assassina

ion, showed that a secret member of the Communist Party's executiv

committee was one of King's closest advisers and speech writers.

This ghost writer for King prepared many of his most famous

speeches, according to testimony given by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover

during a closed door meeting of a House Appropriations subcommittee.

Since Ray during his trips prior to King's assassination visited the

same city in which this ghost writer lives, the FBI is now investigating to

determine if the two met covertly.

ALTAN LIE INVESTIGATION

Recent evidence gathered by FBI agents in one of the most mas-

sive probes in the nation's history. has forced serious investigation of

these possibilities:

M. o That somebody close to King or within his own organization

tipped off his assassin as to the civil rights leader's routine on the day of

his slaying.

• That Ray was hired directly by eertain black nationalists who

paid him with money made available by foreign sources.

• That an international Communist "assassin" squad" was in

volved in the slaying.

Because of Ray's mysterious trips to Mexico and Carada shortly

before the assassination, the entire U.S. intelligence operation, ranging

rom the central entengence Agency to the Defense Inielligence Agency

has been pressed into the hunt for King's killer. a

One CLA report indicates that Ray, who is linked to the murder

weapon by lingerprints and ballistic data, may have visited Cuba during

his Mexican trip, according to information furnished by a Mexican air-

ine official.

The FBI assumption is that, if there was a conspiracy to kill King,

those involved made arrangements to spirit their hired kilier out of the

U.S. to Cuba via either Mexico or Canada. Mai

THE CHANGING TIMES SET

Probably the greatest irony of the probe of King's assassination

is that FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, one of the civil rights leader's:

severest critics when he was alive, is doing everything in his power to

solve the case.

- On the other hand, King's closest aides in the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference are showing little or no interest in whether the

killer is found. "

When Rev. Ralph Abernathy, King's successor as president of the

SCLC, presented a series of demands to Attorney General Ramsey Clark

for the "Poor People's" campaign none of these called for more inten

sive effort to solve King's assassination:

According to persons who attended the meeting, rothing was said

about King's death or the FBI investigation, although a number of the

poor in "Resurrection City" had urged Abernathy, to press for

vigorous probe.

CAREE

er Congressional supporters of Hoover say there äre a number of

compelling reasons for Abernathy's silence. Most important of these is

King's instruction to key aides of his Southern Christian Leadership Con-

ference not long before his death that no verbal attacks were to be made

against Hoover of the FBI for fear of counter action by the FBI director.

The last time King blasted Hoover and the FBI publicly, these law

nakers pointed out, the FBI director called the Negro leader. the "most

notorious liar" that he had ever known - a statement Hoover has never

"Der reads Scar

At the time, the King-Hoover exchange resulted in a White House

rranged meeting at which the veteran FBI director did most of the

According to an unpublished account given to House Appropriations

ubcommittee members, Hoover frankly told King that if King ever re

eated his unfounded charges against the FBI, everything he knew about

ing would be made public:

After that blunt warning, King refrained from ever repeating his

ttack against either Hoover or the FBI. Rev. Abernathy, who accompa-

ied King to Washington for that meeting with Hoover, adopied the same

James Earl Ray would have been

as effective if he had sellled for..

lo hold up grocery stores.

# Ray first tried lo steal a type-

L.A., but was discovered by an as-

sistant manager. He got away but

only after dropping his Army dis-

charge papers and a bank savings

book. Even so, lie stayed around

the neighborhood until a parking

lot attendant recognized him and

called the cops. With no record,

only 21 and an Army veteran, Ray

was given a 90-day term.

"Every time he came back here,

he got into trouble," says his un

cle, Bill Maher, in Alton. And the

Alton police chief, William Peter-

son: remembers

the passing

through of James Earl Ray with a

special loathing: "He was a dirty

neck, the kind of criminal who

gets into all kinds of trouble, hates

and has no respect for the law."

But if Ray blundered, got caught

and returned only to lose another

day, he did so with persistence.

On May 6, 1952 he tried rob-

bing a cab driver in Chicago of

$71 but was

again discovered,

chased by policemen down a one-

way alley; when he refused lo

surrender, one of the patrolmen

fired a shot, hitting him in both

arins.

Ray fell through a base-

ment window, cutting his face

open.

He was found guilly and

sentenced to two years in the

state prison. On March 12, 1954

he was released..

Allempting lo break into a dry

cleaner's in East Alton, Ill. on Aug.

28, 1954, he lost his loafers as he

kicked out the front windows. The

police began arriving and Ray

turned, in stocking feet, to run

across the broken glass, through

i thickets and over the 'railroad

tracks. The police stopped to dis-

mantle the distributor on the en-

gine of his parked car. Ray circled

back and tried to start the motor,

but he took off again as the po-

lice converged. He tried again and

then a third time to return to the

car, both times failing to start it;

finally, with his feet slashed and

bleeding, he ran some. five miles
