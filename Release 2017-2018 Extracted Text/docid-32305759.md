HOUSTON DIVISION

At Orange, Texas

Will make appropriate inquiries at the U. S. Naval

Station (Commander, Texas Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet),

Orange, Texas, regarding the alleged sale of some ten

submarines to

a company known as "Subsurface Research Group"

sometime in May of 1961.

If such sale cannot be confirmed by

appropriate personnel at the U. S. Naval Station, will

determine of such personnel whether or not it would be possi-

ble for any private

firms to have made such a purchase.

If

so, appropriate inquiry should be made to determine pertinent

data re such a sale and to ascertain whether or not the

submarines were

not, whether they

could reasonably be made operational with a minimum of expense

and effort.

If the latter be the case, all appropriate details.

should be developed to determine full

identity of purchaser,

as well as the anticipated use to be made of such submarines

by the purchaser.

NEW ORLEANS DIVISION

At New Orleans, Louisiana

Will interview subject EDGARDO ZAPATA, who has

previously been interviewed by the New Orleans

Office in

connection with another matter.

Will re-interview RICHARD DE BRAM to determine if

there actually exists such a person previously referred to by

DE BRAM aS FRED WATTS, or if this person was confused by DE BRAM

with CHARLES WATERS.
