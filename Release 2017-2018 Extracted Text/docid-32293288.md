Re Tampa airtel 8-27-63 which suggested that it may

bo nore logical to designate Miami as office of origin for this

Investigation.

Our Investigation of La Cosa Nostra has generally

established that Trafficante is the leader of this criminal

organisation in. the Tampa area. It 1s desirable, therefore,

that the Tampa Office should utilize the investigation of

Trafficanto as the initial phase in our attempt to penetrate

the membership and activities of this organization

In the Tanpa

Field Division.

Re Tampa airtal advises that Tampa contemplates closer

over-all coverage of the subjoct's associates in an effort to

develop nore detailed infornation concerning the criminal

organization in the tampa area.

You should also take full

advantage of every opportunity 80 develop live informants among

these associates and the groups which operate in the Tampa Office

Although Trafficante spends substantial anount of his time

in kiant, coverage of hig travel between Tampa and Miami has not

yet produced detailed infornation on the mode of travel or the

allages which he may use if he registers as a passenger on the

commercial air lines. Similarly the general purpose of his travel

would appear to

be in connection with his hoodlun operations but

investigation has not yet established if some of this travel is

carried out for specific reasons.

Tampa should therefore continue to be office of origin

in this case.

Miani Office should nake certain that sufficient

personnel are assigned to develop all possible covernge on

Trafficanto's activities and associates uhile he is in the Miami

ares.

mand and tanpa should carefully and lully coordinate a11

investigative steps so that the Bureau's responsibilities can be

net 1a

the over-all coverage of Trafficante.

Airtel to Tampa

RE: SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR.

NOTE:

Re airtel stated that coverage of Trafficante in Tampa

is maintained by TP 41-C, TP 50-C, TP 107-PC, TP 120 PC, TP 105-C*

and several neighborhood

sources.

Tampa advised that investigation

has established that the subject goes to Tampa at infrequent

intervals.

Our over-all investigation has not yet clearly established

to any exact degree the amount of time spent by Trafficante in either

Tampa or Miami.

We have not yet determined why he maintains his home

in Tampa and specific reasons for the amount of travel to Miami which

he performs.

It does not appear logical at this point in the

investigation to change the

office of origin from Tampa to Miami.

The whereabouts and activities of subject are of the

utmost importance, yet the whereabouts of the subject does not

establish the crux of where subject obtains and how he gets his

finances. The reporting of his activities has likewise not

produced

financial income.

Relative to subject's whereabouts and activities in

the Tampa area, the following is noted:

TP 105-C* maintains coverage of subject and his

family at 3610 El Centro, St. Petersburg Beach, Fla., and such

coverage has established

subject has not used such place for any

possible get together to discuss any personal problems.

TP 120 PC has been able to maintain coverage of

activities at 2505 Bristol, Tampa, it being noted this covers

subject's comings to Tampa and the fact that he does not discuss

ana the

business at such residence

nor congregate with any particular.

individuals there.

TP 50-C is in daily direct contact with such persons

as subject's brothers, SALVATORE, HENRY and TANO, and the

operation of the Dream Bar,

which is the property of the

SANTO TRAFTICAN TE (deceased) Estate.

4.

TP 41-C is in direct daily contact with local

nugbers operators.

5.

TP 107-PC is a potential source

to be contacted

who is directly in daily contact with subject's closest

associates in Tampa, JAMES C. LONGO, FRANK RAGANO, and HENRY

GONZALEZ, attorneys.

6. Neighborhood coverage includes such individuals

as Mr. and Mrs HERBERT GOLDBURG, immediate neighbors; Mrs:

SAMUEL: MENSH,

Mr. MANUEL GARCIA, Close

neighbors; CHARLES

SAMS, U. S. Postal Carrier.

Photos of subject have been furnished most every

airline at. Tampa International Airport,

specifically those having

flights to Miami: Likewise, all police at Tampa International

Airport have been furnished

phoos of subject.

Telephone toll calls from subject's Tampa residence,

as well as residences of his brothers, have been reviewed on a

regular basis and indications are that there is communication

with such individuals in Miami as STEFANO ANTHONY RANDAZZO and

DINO CELLINI.

When in Tampa residence, subject has access to any of

three vehicles: 1959 white Chevrolet Impala, 1963 Fla. license

IN 135063; 1959 white Chrysler Saratoga, 1963 Fla. 3W 6338,

and 1962 turquoise Ford, 1963 Fla. licénse 3-16066, and formerly

also having available the 1960 fawn Plymouth, which has been

reportedly recently purchased by CUCCIA in Miami.

The subject while in the Miami area has had available

to him the white Falcon of PETER GIAMPAPA, as well as cars probably

of JIMMY DUCA

The above indicates close coverage of subject's comings,

goings, and activities while in Tampa, with the noted

exclusion

of automobile coverage, inasmuch as he had four cars available to

him, also excluding the two cars of JAMES C. LONGO, which LONGO

could have ready access to should subject desire any transportation.

A.;

TP 92-1

The above indicates that closer coverage of subject's

whereabouts could be

obtained in the Miami area through highly

confidential Bureau coverage of the white Falcon subject

apparently uses on a regular basis:

Investigation thus far establishesthat subject merely

comes to Tampa when such apparently is a necessity, such as

he came up from Miami for interview with

the FBI; several months

later he came up to Tampa for interview with IRS,

and then he

would appear in Tampa only for functions such as

funerals or

weddings.

Furthernore, TP 120-PC has stated that subject is

hardly ever at his residence and he departs without any

indication of proposed travel.

The only close contacts of

subject in the Tampa area that have been established that would

possibly have knowledge of his comings and goings are JAMES C.

LONGO and SALVATORE C. TRAFFICANTE.. Sach

would therefore

indicate extending

highly confidential Bureau coverage on these

two,

subjects of TP 92-31 and 162-51, respectively.

Investigation in the Miami area indicates this is the

location where the subject has made his

extensive contacts of

probable value to him, such as ex-Cuban associates, ex-Cuban

girl friend, JUDITH SALVAT, and where he is in apparent regular

of New Jersey, and with ANGELO BRUNO, member of the Commission

that subject may have another place to stay and he 'has apparent:

contact with Eden Roc and Fountainbleu Hotels,

Miami Beach, when

it was indicated in the investigation of ANGELO BRUNO that

exterminating contracts could be forthcoming from such hotels.

The evaluation of the Miami investigation, from the

above few instances, therefore, indicates that the mere

reporting

of subjectts whereabouts, has not established how, where,

when, and from whom subject obtains monies, noting it has been

reported that in previous years subject merely reports a set

amount of money as income from parimutuel bettings.

Furthermore,

it is indicated that the mere reporting of subject's contacts in

the Miami area is not the end desired in captioned matter, yet

it is considered most probable that the contacts are already
