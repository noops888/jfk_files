1. On 17 January, David Marwell asked me if the Agency

had any information concerning a UPI report of January 1994

that Belarus had given President Clinton KGB files on

Oswald. (Report attached)

2: On 19 January, I called Marwell with the following

interim response:

- A check with the Do, including the CI Center,

did not turn up any information.

- I asked David Van Tassel at the NSC if he

knew anything about the subject.

He said that he

remembered something about the report, but could

not recall whether there was any validity to it.

He said that he would check further and let me

know the result.
