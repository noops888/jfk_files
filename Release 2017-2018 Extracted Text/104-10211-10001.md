During the year April 1964-April 1965 NOSENKO was under the

medical care of a clA psychiatrist

who visited NOSHINO at regular

intervals, usually weekly, to examine him physically ard to listen

to any comments NOSENKO might have about himself and his situation.

The psychiatrist familiarized himself with availabie materials on

NOSENKO, particularly with reports of his behavior in the months

immediately following the defection. A report which he submitted

on 20 December 1964 is given below.

B. Views of Intelligence Pelsonnel

1. Statement by DERYABIN

a. Introduction

Former KGB officer Peter Sergeyevich DERYABIN has followed

closely the entire course of CIA's investigation of NOSENKO and

his information.

He took part in the interrogations of NOSENKO

1n April 1964, January-February 1965, and October 1966 as an ob-

server and consultant, and he personally questioned NOSENKO during

July and August 1965 concerning certain aspects of his personal

past and early KCB career.

On the basis of his direct, personal

knodledge of conditiong within the Soviet Union and of KGB organi-

zation and procedures prior to his defection in February 1954,

supplemented by continuing study of later informatión from a

variety of sources, DERYABIN is of the opinion that much of what

NOSENKO has said akous himself and the KGB is purposefully false

nor distorted.

Although DERYABIN has been able to offer authorita-

tive comment on many

aspects of NOSENKO's story, the folloring

section of this paper is limited to his remarks

concerning lOSEN-

KO's entry into the KGB (ther MUD)

and his Communist Party affili-

ation,

both of which fall into the period when DERYABIN was active

as a KGB (then MVD) staff officer.

DERYABIN personally interro-

gated NOSENKO on these topics in the summer of 1965.

Since DER-

YABIN was a personnel officer of the KGB (then MGB and MVD) in

Moscow, with long experience in Communist Party activities, at

the time NOSENKO claims to have entered the American Department

of the KGB Second Chief Directorate,

he is particularly qualified

to comment on these aspects of NOSENKO's story.

DERYABIN, as a Soviet Army officer, das graduated in 1945

from the higher counterintelligence school of Snersh (counter-

intelligence with the Soviet Armed

Forces) .

worked in Naval. Smersh in Moscow and in March 1947 began to work

in the MGB as a case officer in the Central Personnel Directorate.

Shortly afterwards, when his superior was appointed Deputy Cnief

of the Chief Guards Directorate for Personnel, DERYABIN trans-

ferred with him to the Guards Directorate.

Directorate personnel officer until May 1952, rising through the

ranks from case officer to the position of Chief of Section.

of his responsibilities was the approval of personnel for service

in various units of the Guards Directorate, and he was also

charge of supervising personnel and security matters concerning

one of the Directorate's surveillance sub-sections.

After requesting a change from personnel to operational

duties, DERYABIN was transferred in

May 1952 to the Austro-German

Department' of the MGB Foreign Intelligence Directorate.

Until

December 1952 he served as the Deputy Chief of a sub-section in

the Counterintelligence Sektor (desk) of the Austro-German Depart-

ment.

He was then appointed Deputy. Chief of the intelligence

Sektor of the same department,.

a position he held until March

1955.

From larch until September 1953, DERYABIN was the Deputy

Chief of the section in MGB Headquarters which was responsible

for the security of Soviets stationed in Austria and Germany:

In September 1953 he was transferred to Vienna, here he became

Deputy Chief of the section in the MVD Legal Residency respong-

ible for the security of Soviets in Austria. He defected to

American authorities on 15 February 1954.

b. DERYABIN '8 Comments

The following statements by DERYABIN are based or his question-

1ng of NOSENKO between 26 July and 13 August 1965.

The questions

asked and the statements attributed to NOSENKO (referred to as

Subject) were during this period. Although the Soviet State Secu-

rity Service did not become known as the KGB until March 1954.

this term is used for convenience sake, except where the specific

organization of the MB or MVD is under discussion. DERYABIN'S

comments follod:

"NOSENKO's Acceptance into State Security*

"Taking NOSENKO's. Own statements at face value, it is highly

improbable that a person such as he has described himself to be

iould be acceptable for a position as a staff officer in State

Security. The following factors are important in this regard:

It was the policy of State Security to avoid hiring

the children of high govertment officials.

b.

Until, STALIN's death in March 1953, KOBULOV, the

man who supposedly helped NOSENKO gain entrance into the

service, had no influence inside the MGS apparatus.

From

about 1948 until 9 or 10 March 1953, KOBULOV had no office

irside the MGB

or the :VD buildings... I know personally that

in these years KOBULOV worked in Germany as Deputy Chief of

the GUSIMZ (Chief Directorate of Soviet Properties Abroad) **

which was once directly under the Council of Ministers and

later under the Ministry of Foreign Trade.

The office was

located on Chkalova Street, near the Kurskiy Railroad

Station (three blocks from my. former apartment)..

* See also Part V.B.

** WISMUT A.G. in Germany was

subordinate to GUSIMZ; for a

C.

It was physically irpossible at the time for NOSENKO

to be recommended for and accepted into State Security, as he

has told us, all in one month,

Karch 1953.

(If one accepts

his earlier version that he had his talk with KOBULOV in Jan

vary or February, his

account is similarly impossible becaise

KOBULOV was not then in State fecurity.)

It would normally

have taken a much longer time, but in addition to this it was

a perica of reorganization and the personnel staff was not

actively conducting treir work at that time.

and perinanent

staff officers were rot sure that they would retain their

positions.

d. In March 1953 NOSENNO was already twenty-five

half years old

or.ly a member of the Konsonol.

He had no

recourendation for Party -embership. and could not become a

member for a full year because of his transfer from one ger-

vice (GRU) to another. It is impossible that State Security

would accept him kroving in advance that on his birthday ne

would be twenty-six years old and without either Komsomol or

Party membership.

Even for the son of a Mirister, the Secre-

tary of the konsomol Committee of the KGB would have to talk

with the Personnel iffice and would not give a recommendation

for his acceptance, especially for the Internal Counterintel-

ligence (Second chief)

Directorate.

In the case of a son of

a Minister and one sho is recommended by KOBJLOV, the secre-

tary would request from NOSENKO a recommendation for Party

membership from the members of the Communist Party where

NOSENKO usEd to work, in this case the GRu.

In this way the

secretary of the Komsomol would be sure himself that NOSENKO

would become a candidate member of the Communist Party during

the next year.

"However, even accepting that despite these obstacles and

' contradictions the KGB would have accepted him, ore must also

remember (according to POSENKO's own statements) that NOSENKO s

file contained the folioring negative points.*

They are serious

and certain of them alone would be enough to cause the

rejection; the totality makes it difficult to believe that at a

time of crisis in the State Security organs anyone would take the

resporsibility of accepting him:

Subject was already married and divorced before entry

Ínto State

Security.

He had been married to General TELEGIN's daughter

and TELSGIN had beer arrested by State Security and was in

jail the day that Subject entered State Security®

C. NOSENKO said that there was a file on OSErKO'g

father in which compromising material was collected on

Subject's family.

NOSENKO agreed that one piece of infor-

mation that would have-been in this file was the fact that

his maternal grandfather died ir. a Soviet prison while under

sentence as a counter-revolutionary.

The social status background in the life of Subject's

mother was nobility.

e.

The shooting incident in Lenirgrad during Horld

War Il and his desertion fron the Naval School in Baku

would have played a very negative role in any consideration

of his acceptance into State Security.

E.

Subject never completed high echool in the rormal

fashion.

Subject was a poor student at the Institute of Inter-

national Relations.

h. It should be added that the KGB would definitely

krod that NOSEKO was involved in an automobile accident

in 1947 and was interrogated by the Militia (traffic court),

found guilty.

fined.

This would definitely play a

negative role in NOSElKO's admission to the KGS.

NOSENKO would never be allowed to enter the KGB having

just recovered from tuberculosis.*

In fact, there was a rule

at that time that no person who ever had tuberculosis (even

twentylears earlier) would be permitted to work in the KGB.

"In addition, after acceptance, the fact that KOBULOV was a

personal friend of Subject's father, as he has told us. moula

have been noted in the file and would have piayed a negative role

in permitting Subject to continue to work in State Security after

KOBULOV's arrest in June 1953.

"I asked Subject how he answered some of the questions in the

anketa (entry questionnaire), particularly the questions on his

former wife, her relatives,

and on his mother's ancestry.** I

then asked

subject how it was, taking into account his mother's

aristocratic ancestry, the fact that her father died in jail. the

Trotskyite allegations against Subject's father, the fact that

Subject's former father-in-law (TELEGIN) was still in jail, and

the fact that Subject was present when TELEGIN's apartment was

searched-that he had been accepted into the KGs, particularly

in 1953 during the confusion and changes after the death of STALIN.

Subject admitted that the question was logical,

and said that he

could only assume that the influence of KOBULOV and the important

and influential position of his own father outweighed these nega-

tive factors®

He also cited his GRU experience in this connection.

"I then asked Subject how he had reported his second marriage

to the KGB.

He replied that before the marriage he had mentioned

* NOSENKO first mertioned having had tuberculosis during the June

1962 meetings, when he described it as a minor case but said he

was under out-patient treatment until 1958.

He next pertioned

his illness in 1966, describing how he sometimes coughed up a

"glass of blood" at a time. Although DERYABIN's "questioning

covered this part of NOSEIO's life in detail, there was no

mention of tuberculosis in July and August 1965.

bride (which was 'clean'),

and that after

the marriage he had filled out another arketa ir. which he included

all the required data on his wife and her relatives. Aiter con-

siderable prompting, Subject said that he tad indicated that she

and her parents had been in france, but that he had concealed the

fact that her grandmother had been

ir. German-occupied territory

during the war.

(He admitted that the KGB would have learned this

in a routine check, however.)

I then reviewed for Subject the

negative security factors mentioned above, adding the arrest of

KOBULOV, the fact that his ned wife and her parents had been

abroad, the fact that her grandmother was in German-occupied

territory, the fact that Subject was now over-age for the Komsomol

but not yet a Party member or candidate, and the fact that Subject

received a 15-day sentence for misuse of cover documents and fr

curring venereal disease, and asked if he didn't think that his

personnel file had been reviewed in 1954, and if 30, what grounds

there could have been for retaining him in the KGB.

Subject said

that he thought that his file probably was reviered but that

again the influence of his father had saved him.

Subject added

that another important factor was probaoly his language qualifi-

cation and particularly his higher education.

I pointed out to

Subject that if his second wife and her parents had been abroad

it was impossible that her name check could have been negative.

He admitted it was illogical, but insisted that this was

the FCD became the SCD, ard vice versa.

NOSENKO stuck to this

even when told he was wrong; he did not say he did not know or

did not rementer. perhaps realizing that he could not claim not

to remember what directorate he served in.

(Actually, the change

in numerical designations was instituted by BERIYA right after

STALIN's death in March 1953 and persisted until the KGB was

organized in March 1954.

Thus, NOSENKO does not know what the

correct designation of his own directorate was at the time that

he allegedly

entered on duty with Soviet State Security and for

the entire first year of his alleged service there.

told CIA that he joined the KCB in 1952. See Part V.B.

by the claim that

KOBULOV's recommendation resulted in a simplified entrance pro-

"Rank Pay: Asked about his salary when he first started to

work in the KGB, NOSENKO said he got a basic salary of 1700 rubles

as a case officer, 500 rubles for his rank of lieutenant, plus

secrecy. language, and longevity pay. He insisted that this was

correct, even

dren told that KGE officers were no longer being

paid for rank in March 1953, and said that although he remembered

that there was one year--1954--when they were not paid for rank.

he was sure that when he first entered on duty he received this

pay.

Salary for rank was taken away from State Security officers

in September 1952 ard was not restored until April 1954.

"Promotion to Senior lleutenant: In giving the chronology

of his promotion to various military ranks, NOSENKO claimed to

have been promoted to senior lieutenant in

April 1953, shortly

after joinirg the KGB.

Told that this was impossible,

and that

no one in the KGB was promoted a this time; NOSENKO replied that

he couldn't say about anyone else but he was sure that he had re-

ceived his promotion at that time.

In fact, this is impossible:

all promotions in the KGB were frozen from the time BERIYA took

over as minister (March 1953) until late 1953.

"Visitor's Pass Procedures: In talking about his first visit

to the KGB to process for employment, NOSENKO was unable to re-

call the procedures employed by the KGS Pass Office in issuing

visitor's passes.

Specifically, he maintained that the name of

the interviewer was not indicated on the pass.

In fact,. the

name of the interviewer did appear on the pass and the inter-

viewer had full responsibility for the visitor while he was on

KGB premises.

While it is understandable that NOSENKO might

have forgotter. the details involved if he had only visited there

a few times more than ten years ago, if he worked at KGB-fiead-

quarters for over ten-years-as a staff officer and particularly

as a super:isor he would have freguent occasion to admit visitors.

and thus should krow visitor's pass procedures quite well.

NOSENKO has

since said that he spoke to no personnel officers

prior to acceptance by the KGB or afterwards, thereby indicating

that his staterents to DERYABIN were untrue.

Chief Directorate buildiag at the Agricultural Exhibition. Thus,

NOSENKO seems to be unaware that the K.I. has not existed since

1951, and that the K.I. building

and the building at the Agri-

cultural Exhibition were one and the same place.

"NOSESKO'S Claim to Have Been a Komsomol: Searetery in the

Second Chief Directorate, KGB

"NOSENKO claimed to have become a member of the Komsomol

Organization (K/O) of the KGB when he entered on duty in March

1953, to have been elected as Secretary of Komsomol Organization

of the Second Chief Directorate in the fall of 1953, and to have

served in that capacity until the fall of 1954, when he was re-

moved because he used operational-alias documerts in obtaining

treatment for a venereal disease he had incurred.

He claims to

have been excluded from the komsonol, without prejudice, when he

attained his 27th birthday in October 1954.

"Asked to describe how he transferred from the konsomol Organ-

ization of the Naval Intelligence Post in the Baltic to the Kom-

soinol Organization of the KGB, NOSENKO gave an entirely incorrect

description of this procedure, both as regards deregistration from

the K/O in the Baltic, and registration with the k/0 in the KGB.

He stated that he was issued

new Komsomol registration card by

the KuB K/O, without reference to the previous K/O in the Balties

this is impossible.

"NOSENKO gave an incorrect account of how a K/O secretary 18

elected, stating that he was elected at a meeting of the K/O.

In

fact, the K/O meeting can only select the K/O committee, which will

convene separately to elect the Secretary.

"NOSENKO could not desuribe the duties of a K/0 secretary in a

specific manner.

"NOSENKO did not know who was the secretary of the overall KGB

K/O.

secretary of the SCD K/O would be directly subordinate

to him and would deal wich him frequently.

"NOSENKO was unable to desc-ibe his dealings with the KGB K/O

or the identities or responsibilities of the people with whom he

dealt there.

"NOSENKO insisted that in 1953-54, the maximum age for a Kom-

somol member was 27. In actual fact, the maximum age was 26 (1t

was raised later).

This point is important, both because NOSENKO

should know exactly if he had served as a K/0 secretary, and also

because it refutes

his story that he was excluded from the Kom-

somol for over-age in 1954.

"NOSENKO maintained that all the members of his K/O paid dues

In the amount of 2 percent of their monthly salaries. This 1s

Incorrect, as monthly Komsomol dues were calculated on a sliding

scale deternined by wage group:

at that time, Komsomol members

earning up to 500 rubles monthly paid 0.5 percent: those earning

1500 rubles paid 1 percent, and those

rubles paid 1.5 percent.

The K/O secretary collects the dues,

and must krow the right amount:

"NOSENKO did

not know whether or not a Komsomol Congress

took place while he was K/Ö secretary,

saying that they took

the 12th Komsomol Congress

which convened in March 1954 was the first since 1948; at this

12th Congress a number of changes were made in the Komsomol Rules

(Ustav).

in a good dead of preparatory work for this Congress, which was

a big event in the life of every Komsomol worker at the time, and

could not be forgotten."

Although DERYABIN's direct knowledge of the KGB ended in 1954,

his detailed information of KGB procedures has been updated with

mog "asked to describe how he conducted nome checks on a

Soviet citizen and on a new arrival to the American Embassy in

1953-54, NOSENKO gave a superficial description of how such

checks were done.

However, he resisted every attempt to get im

to describe this process in detail, and he made several blunders

which show that he never actually ran such a check himself.

example, he did not know where the records of all Soviet citizens

who have been tried are kept, and he attempted to improvise an

answer (completely wrong) that they would check with the Militia

about this.

NOSENKO correctly said that Archives were located

on Kirov Street, but he wag completely unabie to stretch his

limited knowledge to provide a description of now these various

repositories were actually checked.

in the 1950-59 period. Here again he was in difficulty and re-

fused even to try®

He did not even know the everyday term Spets-

proverka, which

means a check for clearance.

"It was particularly interesting that he did not feel able to

dispute my challenges of his informatior, even though he undoubt-

edly knows that I do not have first-hand krowledge of procedures

in this period.

I even tested this on one occasion by asking

NOSENKO the difference between the lst Spets Otdel (Special

Department - KGB cards and files) and the Operati:no-Uchetniy

Otdel (Operational Reports Department - the functional name for

the lst Special Department).

He answered that the ist

Department holds the files on Soviet criminal cases rile the

Operational Reports Department is for political and espionage

It seems he invented this answer on the spot.

tion, it is wrong that political and security cards are separate

Erom criminal cres in the lst Special Department.

They were

in my time and must still be combined in one card file.

"NOSENKO gtates that he knows nothing about the files of

the First Chief Directorate.

It is unbelievable that in ten

years of service in the Second Chief Directorate NOSENKO never

saw a First Chief Directorate file; how else would he be able

to check information on toreigners, especially on American En-

bassy personnel?

in such a check is an inquiry

to the first Chief Directorate and a check of any files they

According to his own account, NOSENKO

should have been doing this type of thing the whole of his ten

years of service, without regard to whether he was assigned to

the Anerican Department or the Tourist Department."

circumstances:

- In five tightly organized meetings in 1962 in

- In routine debriefing sessions after his defection,

where a spectal effort was made not

to put pressure on NOSENKO or express doubts about his

staterents.

- Under detailed hostile interrogation (especially

April 1964 and

January-March 1965).

• In extended, detailed debriefing sessions which

NOSENRO could not evade

(May-November 1964, May 1965,

July-August 1965, and October 1966).

Thus there were

opportunities to note his performance and reac-

tions under varied degrees of stress and control.

The features of NOSENKQ's conduct, manner, and techniques

discussed below

are

confined

to those which were clearly and con-

sistently observed by all of the officers involved.

b. NOSENKO'& Conduct in Meetings

NOSENKO in bilet, super-iciad.

uncritical debriefings (of

he sort which characterized the 1962 and 1964 Geneva meetings

and the debriefings prior to 4 April 1964) was reasonabig con-

vincing in his manner.

For example, on the basis of the hur-

ried sessions of June 1962 in Geneva, which did not allow tire

for systematic or detailed questioning, the CIA case officer

in commenting on NOSENKO's conduct mentioned "the ease of his

manner, the sureness of his knowledge of matters which he should

have known, and the amount of checkable information he provided."

NOSENKO seemed to that case officer to be "under little or no

restraint as to the amount and nature of what he told us"

"made a convincing and good

personal impression: a vigorous,

temperamental and vital man."

Similarly, nothing in NOSENKO's

manner caused doubts on the

part of the FBI represertativee who

took NOSENKO's reports in February, March, and early April 1964.

It became apparent, however, when the cases lOSENKO had

mentioned briefly

in early meetings were taken up in detail in

leisurcly debriefings after the defection, that he could not add

facts corsistent with what he had said before.

He was unable to

recall related incidents or additional circunstances which did

not come to mind in the first telling, despite being aided by

questioning from different angles or

in different contexts.

The

same results were obtained in exhausting his store of operational

leads (with a half dozen exceptions) and his information on &GB

procedures, installationg,

Having once

reported on these general

NOSENKO could offer nothing

more when debriefed again, regardless of the method of question

ing tried.

Repeatedly he used the same stories to illustrate

his points; new stories did not emerge.

In a period of nine

months, NOSENKO was drained of information on nis parsonar ind

professional experiences and knowléage..

A technique NOSENKO has frequently used to explain his

ability to supply details and to forestall further questicring

has been to claim poor memory.

"Different people have cafferent

types of memories," he has said on many occasions, or on others:

have told what I remember."

The case officers who have

handled NOSENKO agree, on the other hand, that he has an excel-

lent memory,

although perhaps a peculiar one:

NOSENKO dia not

always recall most easily those events which had occurred most

recently, or those incidents which were most closely related to

He was able, for example, to remember detailed information

on the penetration of the Courier Transfer Station in Paris and

to give a long, detailed, and ordered account of the compromise

of PENKOVSKIY,

in neither of which he claimed

ary personal role;

able to name hundreds of KGB officers, to gi:e the

which many of them transferred from one component of

the Second Chief Directorate to another, and to describe their

responsibilities at particular times.

Yet NOSENKO forgot where

he himself served in

the GRU; he could not consistently dis-

cribe the circumstances of his divorce; he failed to provide a

consistent date for his entry into the KGB and for his transfer

the American Department to the Tourist Department in 1962.

Likewise, NOSENKO remembered details of KGB operations which,

"ANDREY" case

in 1953, took place in the relatively dis

tant past, but he could not recall the travels, friends, and

activities of his own target. john V. ABlü AN or details of opera-

tions against many American code clerks in 1960 and 1961.

These limitations of krowledge and quirks o. menory were

evident rot only during meetings when NoSEsKo wes being decriesed.

They were also apparent in the interrogacions which supplanted

the debriefings.

C.

NOSENKO 's Behavior Under Interrocatior

(1) Introduction

In the many and long interrogation sessions there emerged

habits of behavior noticeable to each of the CiA officers present.

Trese characteristics of NOSENKO were his manner of recourting

events and his evasiveness, inproviseiions, ard other defersive

resiniques. They are reviened belor.

(11) Manner of Recounting Events

Typical of NOSElKO's performance in the interrogations were

the

following points:

- Talking about operations he supeivised and about his per-

soral

role

in the KGB Headquarters aspests of other operations,

NOSENKO habitually used the passive voice ("it was decided") or

indicated that he was not alore in these activities ('there was

no ascourting on who was working on any cose cieri case--it was

GRYAZNOV, KOSCLAPOY, NOSENKO, and also working has KLYPIN, GRIBAN-

OV, " or

nie made the decision--I and KOVSHUK and GRYAZNOV,

"or "I

and GRYAZYOV discussed this with him. '

when asked where a par-

cicular

conversation

ne

rarely located it in his own

office ("I was

in KOVSHUK's

office wher KOSLOV cailed him about

the trip" or "I was in KLYPIN'S office and he las

talking to

KOVSHUK*").

"he said to me," etc.!, bur it was in just such matters that

NOSENKO most often contradicted himself le.g.. his relatiorship

with GRIEANOV and his part in the recruietent approach to the

Anerican code clerk James STORSBERGI.

- In repeating certain stories (the CHEREPANOV case and the

provocation against Professor Frederick BARGHOCRN are examples!

NOSENKO gave them in precisely the same oder, without addition

or omissior.

In relating the PENKOVSKIY story, which he stressed

he learned little by little' from several different sources, he

presented the facts each time in nearly identical order.

Asked

for more details

on these cases, he irvariably insisted-often

with irritation--that he knew rothing more ard if he did. he

would have reported it.

Other factors contributed to the im-

pression that

in such instances NOSENKO had delivered his infor-

mation by rote:

Statements like "I don't remember what I told

you before" when queried agair. on a particular case; detachment

and a lack of

emotion when describing the compromise of Soviets.

who, like himself, had cooperated with American Istelligence:

POPOV, PENKOVSKIY, and CHEREPAVOV: an irability to correlate

dates and events in different operations which he said he was

handling such as conflicts ir the timing of his approach to

M.E. JOHNSON and in the date he gave for jor. V. AIDIAN's visat

to the Pushkin Street dead drop, and conflict between the dates

of his participation in the MORONE case and his travel to Cuba).

## Page 27

TOP SECRET

628-

- NOSENKO, with a few excuptions (notably the compromise of

PENKOVSKIY and

the ABIDIAN Visal: to the dead drop sitel, could

not supply specific or deprese dates for operational activi

ties during the period of his

service in the U.S. Imbassy Section.

Beyond recourse to the phrase "1960, 1961," he refused to estimate

the dates or to associate these

activities with the time of the

year or events in his personal life.

(111) Evasion, Improvisation, and Other Defenses

In the debriefings before the interrogations, ROSENKO avoided

questions and topics not of his own choosing, saying that he would

give full details "later," when systematic debriefing began.

When the question or topic came up anew in a later debriefing.

re would plead fatigue or boredom and propose:

"This morning

we drink; tomorrow we work."

Prior to & April 1964 he provided

only accounts of operations selected by himself; it was only

after 4 April 1964 that he could be, constrained to reply to de-

tailed questioning on other matters.

From that point on, other evasive tactics became familiar

interrogators.

He would try to change the subject or

to shift from

the specific event to a generalized account of how

such things were done in principle.

He would clain bad memory

on grounds that, for example, operations against U.S. Embassy

personnel were hopeless and

useless anyway.

lie would dismiss the

or the entire operarion

as unimportant (for example, the

microphones in the U.S. Embassy).

He would set out reasons

for

his ignorance of things he admittedly should have known (his own

"poor performance,"

preoccupation with other matters, inattention

to duty, absence from the KGB while on vacation, lack of time to

details because he was a supervisor).

Unable to name or

talk about KGB indigenous agents working against Americans, in-

cluding those in operations under his supervision, NOSENKO

disparaged the quality of, such

agents ("they never reported any

ching of interest on anyone"); he cited their low educational

level and their inferior status as servants and employees as

one reason none of them could give the KGB operationally useful

information.

In fact, the record of many indicated previous em-

ployment which would demand at least the equivalent of a college

degree or certificate from a technical institute.

Numerous maids

were former school teachers, one was formerly a chemist.

When evasion failed, it seemed to the interrogators that

NOSENKO improvised his answers.

Some of these evident improvisa-

tions led him into unacceptabie statements or positions.

his responses to the questioning

on John V. ABIDIAN as an example:

Not knowing about ABIDIAN's Cat,

he said the KGB could not get

at it.

(In fact,

the car was held by. Soviet customs for two

weeks, and later

NOSENKO himself spoke about the way the KGB used

Embassy chauffeurs

for access to cars.)

Not knowing

of ABIDIAN's

trips out of the USSR, he claimed that the KGB had no way to

find out where Embassy officers went when they made trips out of

the country.

(In fact, ABIDIAN had told his language teacher

each time

and she, as NOSENKO said, was a KGB agent; also,

arranged his trips by long-distance phone from Moscow to his des

tination abroad, and the KGB can cover such calls.)

Not knowing

Of ABIDIAN'S trip within the USSR, he spoke of a vacation which

he latter admitted to be false.

Asked why he did not know personal

he said "only the First Chief Directorate" Usos

when

the

interrogator parsued the point, NOSENiO said he rememered that

KOVSHK did have a copy in his

office,

"bus an old one, 1956,

which didn't list ABIDIA'i."

Under pressure about ABIDIAN's visit

to Pushkin Strcet, NOSENIO said the XGB thought that ABIDIA may

where the drop, if any, might be.

As another example, when he

initially

asked about Gorge BLAkE, the kGs agene

in MI-6,

the context of the question was a discussion of Second Chief

Directorate operations.

NOSEIKO labeled it as such

"was not as important

3S VASSALL."

Later, when the name was men

tioned again, he asked:

"Who's BLAKE?"

on other occasions, when his self-contradictiong were pointed

out or when he admitted ignorance of matters ho acinowledge he

should have known, NOSENKO would fall back upon one of the follo-

ing lines of defense:

- "What I know I tell you;

what I remember I tell

you, " or "I don't know," "I car't explain,"

said:

"Time

a check via such a source.

He repeatedly stated

that "time will show" that he is not a provocateur.

At one point

he engaged in the following dialogue with his interrogators:

NOSENKO:

would find that I was only in these two deparcrents

and only in these positions...

(later in the session)

NOSENKO:

NOSENKO:

someone, because anyone in the KGB should know

that, yes, there was a POSENKO.

because I cave you their ranes.

NOSENKO:

d. Additional Observations

Interrogators

to be beyond the interest of

he asked, even while

discussing his own KGB responsibilities:

Frequently you tell me about a case,

and I will remember details.

Other examples of NOSENKO's inguisi-

tiveness include the-following:

- NOSENKO inquired in early 1964 whether the clA orit-

cer who met him in Gereva two years earlier had received a

medal for that phase of the operation.

(1i) Acceptance of Contrary Information from Other Sources

Inder interrodarion.

even when accused of lying, NOSENKO

rarely

challenged the validity of CIA's information nor claimed

superior knowledge. The only facts he challenged strongly were

incontestably true, such as the date of GOLITSYN's defection, the

date

Of ABIDIAN'S visit to the Pushkin Street dead drop, KOSO-

LAPOV' & travel separate from JENNER, and KOSOLAPOV®s November 1960

trip to Helsinki.

It seemed at all times that he

accepted that

CIA knew more than he did on tovics including conditions in the

DSSR and cases and people for whom he clained direct responsibility.

•He never challenged DERIABIN's statements about KGB procedures,

although aware that his own information was sore recert.

(e) Discussions with NOSENKA on Hig Own Performance

After admitting his inability to respond to questions about

operations

in wnich he said he participated, NOSENKO sometimes

gave a general appraisal of his own performance.

He would admit

that it was

"impossible to have such memory breaks" and agree

that his response was neither

reasonable nor acceptable ("In your

place I wouldn't believe it either," or on another occasion,

"It

will look bad to your boss"). Admitting that the guestions

fair, logical, and clearly put, he acknowledged at least a dozen

times during

the January-March 1965 interrogation that his per-

He also admitted that most of the leads he had passed were

he stated that the great majority were

"no good," unimportant, or

people with whom the KGB had not worked ("Maybe

'ANDREY" became

not interesting to KGB, changed jobs, and was not so important any

"some

of the agents recruited by the Seventh Department

weren't meeting the KGB": etc.)

He consistently estamated, how

ever, that there were about 20 to 25 "good" leads.

c. Polyaraph Testing

1o Test 1n Aptil 19€4

Shortly after his defection, NOSEKO agreed to undergo a

polygraph examiration which tre CIA handlers had told him was a

routine part of his defector processing,

He was i-formed on

3 april 1964 that the test would be administered the following

morning, and that it was therefore advisable for him to get a

good night's rest and to refrain from alcorolic beverages.

ENKO drank heavily on the night of 3 hor:l, did not enter hig

bedroom until 0100 hours on 4 April.

and following breakfast a

on 4 April consumed several gin-and-torics.

quently, when NoSaiKO thought he was not beire observed, he was

seen to remove his hand from his lips hurziedly.*

Followirg a medical examiration by a physicia: who noted

that NOSENKO häd been drinking, he was irtroduced to the CIA

polygraph operator.

An experierced interrogator, Eluent in the

2. Test in October 1965 on lee Harvey OSWALD

#, Introduction

CIA conducted a

polygraph examination of NOSENXO on

18 October 1966 on ie subject of Lee Harvey OSNALD.*

Since the previous polygraph test in April 1964, NOSENKO

had been under close security guard, his novenents restricted,

and in the interis had been interrogated in detail and accused

of bad faith in dealing with U.S. Government authorities.

NOSENKO bad not been interviewed by CIA during the six months

prior to October 1966.

He had had no access to alcohol or

drugs, his food consumption had been normal, ard his sleep

had been adequate.

NOSENKO was given no advance notice of the polygraph

examination.

Upon entering the room where it was to take

place, he immediately recognized the officer present as the

person who administered the first CIA polygraph test two and

one-half years earlier.

NOSENKO correctly

said that they had

first met on 4 April 1964.

In the pre-test interview, questions on the OSWALD case

were put to NOSENKO in Russian, his answers (also in Ruggian)

were recorded, the operation of the machine was explained,

and clarifications of the

questiong ard his answers were

made.

series of questions pertaining to the OSWALD

case are given below in their entirety,

VII!. NOSEIKO'S BONA PIDES: ANALYSIS ÄND CONCLUSIONS

Introsuction

rity of the United States.

is NOSE KO's om testimony.

studied, and a large

body of facts pertinent to his bona fides

wag thus assembled.

from other sources

and the views

CIA, have been presented in Part IIi. through. Part VIl. of this

paper.

The basic questions with reçard to the bona fides of

NOSENKO are the following:

- Is there reason to question the general accuracy

3ill completeness of NOSENKO's accounts of his situation

and motivations in contactirg CIA and later defecting,

his personal life, military service, positions in the

KGB, personal participation in KGB operations, know-

ledgeability about KGB

activities and the way he learned

of them, and his associations with KGB personnel?

- If there are grounds for doubting the general

accuracy and completeness of these accounts, then what

are the explanations for NOSEYKO's actions,

for the

nature of the

Information he has provided, and-for-

other Soviet sources having authenticated his personal

life and KGB career?

In assessing the bona fides of NOSENKO, the classic method

has been used: evaluating his production and sourcing, examining

his autobiography, and appraising him and the circumstances of

this operation.

These points, wity the conclusions drawn from

each, are reviered belor.

The ciscussion continues with a survey

of the sources who have corroborated NOSENKO's background and

status, and this is followed by argumertations on the various

hypotheses which could explain NOSEYKO as a source.

The final

portion is a summary of conclusions about NOSENKO'& bona fides.

Evaluation of Production

## Page 43

644.

NOSEVKO's counterintelligence production includes all of his

information on the

Soviet intelligence and security organs:

- their structure, functions, methods, ard procedures:

- their officers and their agents of Soviet citizenship,

- their operational activities inside and outside the

USSR.

For the most part this portion of the paper (as in Part VIII.C.

through Part VIII.P.) follows a format in which

the evidence

Bunnarazed, the facts interpreted, and conclusions presented.

2. KGB Organization, Personalities, Methods

Ability to discuss the structure of his service in general

and at least sore of its couponents in particular is an absolutely

minimal reguirement for anyone who claims to have beer erployed

within that service.

At the same time, current infotration or the

organization of an intelligence

service is of classic interest to

opposing intelliger.ce ard security

services.. Organizational

changes are irdicators of policy and planning trends in the ser-

vice; short of a penetration of the service's leadership, such

changes are perhaps the most reliable reflection of changes in

operational exphasis and tactics.

Had NOSENKO's information on the organization of the KGB

been novel in this sense, it would have been of corsiderable

value, while the exposure of this information--although perhaps

riot a

major loss to the Soviets--would nonetheless have been

against the KGB's best interests.

ROSENKO'S reports on

organization of the KGB in 1964

(Paçes 352-358) agree with and

are a logical extersion

of that framework of KGB organization

newly revealed by the 1961 sources,

but this weighs reither for

nor against him as the source:

absence of cortradictory

information, he cannot be subject to criticism or to suspicion

because his

reports

show no redirection of the thrust of the

Furtnermore. NOSEKO's staterents indicating that there

have been no major changes in the years betreen the 1959 re-

organization and 1964 are asseptasie in the light of available

information from other sources.

The information which NosENKO

provided on the KGB's organization therefore neither supports

nor discredits his bona fides.

NOSENKO & information oi some 1.000 Soviets connected with

intelligence and security activities

is an impressive achieve-

These identifications, however, must be evalu

ated according to the damage inflicted upon the Soviets by his

exposure of these personalities.

In this respect, the discus-

sion must concern new identifications, for intelligence person-

alities previously exposed could not be danaged any further by

a repetition of their compromise.

This discussion must be fur-

ther restricted to new identifications of staff personel, be-

cause

the entire Soviet population is available to the KGB for

occasional use

as it sees fit, with the loyalty and discretion

of the individual as the only limiting factors; to lean that a

Soviet employed at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow is an agent re-

porting to the KCB is to learn nothing that has not already

been taken

for granted, and besides.

NOSEiKO has been the source of any interesting details and

examples of KGB nocus operardi (Pages 359-340), but while useful

for illustrative purposes and valuable because of the fact that

the meterial was easily coliatable for study purposes, none of

the methods described could be consisered

their exposure in

any event would rot prevont their continued use

his lack of knowledge of the

operation.

effect that curtain Soviets were not affiliated with the KGB:

in Geneva, for example, where

he had daily access to the KGB

Legal Residency for months and claimed nearly complete know-

ledge of KGB personnel, he ramed 15 of a KS3 staff which he

said totalled at the most 18:

as many as 55 of the approximately 120 Soviets station-

ed there (a proportion which is consistent with other areas-

and defectors' estimates). NOSENKO was not entirely accurate

concerning even KGB officers on his own delegation in Geneva.

discussion below. This subject, tuo, must be corsidered neutral

evidence in the bona ficies assessment.

NOSENKO has shown himself to be both uninformed and inaccurate

in his answers to questions on KGB Headquarters

He has been unabie to

Thus, information on the more up-to-date forms, co-

ordination requirements, mechanization of records and tracing

mechanisms, etc., could have been a singular contribution to our

knowledge: NOSENKO could

not describe anything of this

sort.

ignorance

based on not having been a KGB Headquarters officer.

3. Operational Leads

a. Introduction

Consideration of NOSENKO's operational leads must take into

account the KGB positions and personal associations (with attendant

access to information) which NOSENO has claimed for himself.

He

Indicated Clint the breadth of his Incidledge about KGB agent opera-

tions and development cases increased as he rose from case officer

in the U.S. Embassy

Section

in 1953-1955 and in the American lourist

Section in

1955-1958 to become Deputy Chies of the latter section

in 1958-1959, Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section in 1960-1961,

and finally Deputy Chief of the Tourist Department from 1962 until

his defection.

Simultaneously he established lasting contacts with

his KGB colleagues so that, for example, even after leaving

the

U.S. Embassy Section for

the second time, in December 1961, NOSENKO

kept abreast of its most important activities.

On these grounds

NOSENKO presented himself as an authoritative

source, one who

could detail the

successes and failures of the KGB in recruiting

Westerners--especially Americans--in the USSR over the years from

1953 through 1963.

Repeatedly NOSENKO asserted that his leads to

KGB agents constituted proof of his bona fides.

b. Operations Involving Americans

NCSENKO drew a picture of the recruitment scene in Moscow

showing that:

- Since the "ANDREY" case of the early 1950°g* the KGB

recruited no Americans on the U.S. Embassy staff, succeed-

ing only in recruiting one contract employee who was in

MOSCOW On IDY.

NOSINKO reported on recruitment approaches

to six American officials stationed

in Moscok, all of whot

refused to collaborate with the Kig. He discussed 14 de:elop-

ment cases which

never culmirated in recruitment approaches

to these U.S. Goverrment employees in Mosson, and he named

11 officials at the Moscow Embassy who were investigated bi

the KG3.

Inese operacions, NOSENKO asserted, comprised the

total KGB activity açainst Embassy personnel

with the ex-

ception of tire technical penetratioes (sce Part VIII. B.4.).

- Seven American correspondents in Noscow had been re-

cruited by the KGB, four of them knüm to NoSEiko fion the

years 1953-1954 when he was working against U.s. newspaper-

Another two were under development by the KGB during

that period.

- The Aterican Express Company representative in Moscow,

Arsene FRIFPEL,

had become a KGB agent

in 1959; NOSENKO was

the case officer.

- The number of American visitors recruited by the KG3

In 1962-1963 was 14.

and if there had been others, NOSENKO

would have known about then in light of his senior position

in the Tourist Department during that period.

Moreover.

for

the years before 1962, NOSF:KO provided leads to 19 other

American tourists whom the KGB recruited, plus one who was

serving the GRU when he came to Moscow.

NOSENKO also de-

scribed 18 development cases and nine

investigations in

which the targets were American tourists.

As for KGB operations outside the Soviet Union, NOSENKO gave leads

to four recruited Americans about whom he learned through corver-

sations with KGB associates:

a U.S. intelligerce officer having

the KGB cryptonym "SASHA" (stall inidentified).

a penstration of

Orly Courier Iransfer Station identified as Sergeant Robert Lee

JOHNSCN), and two agents in Gereva (naines not given

and as yet act

positively identified).

NOSENKO leaged of the kos agent status

of Horace G. LUNT] an

American professor, because he tock part in

recruitment while on ToY in

Sofia, and of the facili

Legal Residency agent Clarant because of the connection

between karand bernard kote:,

an American tourist with whose

case NOSEiKO was personally involved.

In addition, NOSEYKO de-

scribed two develosment cases with U,S, citizens.

From his know-

ledge of the "SASHA" operation, NOSENKO also knew that the KGB

had no ager.t sources able to supply irformation concerning the

Cuban missile crisis of October 1962.

access were as broad

Other information, Forever, contradicts NOSEYKO's assurances

that he reported

all major

cases involving Americans working

at the U.S. Eubassy in Moscow:

- GOLITSYN's reports indicate that a U.S. military code

clerk was recruited in 1960,

and other factors point toward

this person being Janes STORSBERG or possibly willian HURLEY

(Pages 166-182).

NOSEiKO, the supervisor of operations

against Embassy code clerks. in 1960-1961, stated that

STORSBERG rejected the recruitment

approach, and when inter-

viewed on the basis of the NOSENKO lead, STORSBERG confirmed

Both agree the approsch was made in the latter part

of 1961•

- GOLITSYN's reports cover six other operations (Pages

595-598) which NOSEiKO has not mentioned:

The KG9's recruit-

ment of a female employee at the Enbassy in 1957, the pre-

sence of a code clerk in the Embassy in 1960 who was a KCS

agent, an unsuccessful recruitment approach to a female sec-

retary at the Enbassy prior to July 1960, the KGa plan to

complete the recruitment of an inericar diplomat following

his rsassignment from Moscow in 1959, the KGB's recruitmere

of or planned recruitment approach to a U.S. Embassy employee

(possibly a code clerk) prior to April/Nay 1960, and a KGB

the last of these cases; see beiow.)

On the basis of available information, NOSENKO cannot be

faulted on the completeness of his reporting about American tour-

ists recruited, approached, and under development by the KGB, but

he could cite only one instance of KÜB investigations uncovering

NOSENKO 's reporting on individual cases wherein he was a per-

sonal participant or supervisor is not, with few exceptions, con-

tradicted by information available from other sources.

Nearly all

of his statements have proven accurate when they could be compared

In fact, the imericans whon he cited

the Soviet Union, and many of them are known

to have been of operational interest to the KGB, as NOSENKO said.

The exceptions to his general accuracy of reporting, however. are

in themselves and in reference

to his claimed

positions in the U.S. Embassy. Section during 1960-1961:*

KOSOLAPOV, NOSENKO's direct sub

American military code clerk

JENNER: aS

supervisor of all oper-

ations against code clerks at the

U.S. Enibassy.

NOSENKO was familiar

with the details of all such major

activities.

The KGB knew that the U.S. mili-

tary code

clerk James KEYSERS,

whom NOSENKO personally contacted

in an effort to persuade him to

defect, did not report the earlier

recruitment approach by the KGB.

JJ ENNER

and KOSOLAPOV travelled on

separate days. (Pages 186-200)

KEYSERS reported the recruitment

approach immediately after it

occurred, and the report was

submitted in an Embassy room

later found to have a concealed

microphone. (NOSENKO stated that

he was a customer for microphone

intercepts at the time and that

this microphone was monitored on

a continuous basis by KGB per-

sonnel.) (Pages 213-219)

* An example of NOSENKO's inaccuracy on events during his later

in the Tourist Department

related to his

arrest of American Professor Frederick BARGEJORN :

According to

the approval for this KGB action in which he had a per-

sonal part was obtained from BREZHNEV in KHRUSHCHEV's absence

from Moscow, and the arrest was made a few hours later: BARG-

HOORN was arrested on 31 October 1963, and on that day and the

day before KHRUSHCHEV made public appearances in Moscow. (BREZH

In addition, a number of Americans--e.g., Walter RASK, Adam

BROCHES, Henry APISSON, Herbert HO. ARD,

Vasiliy VOLKOV, Milliam

WALLACE, Thomas Whitney, and Stanley ZIRING--denied having been

recruited by the KGB, as NOSEYKO said they had been.

The only noteworthy internal inconsistencies in NOSEYKO's

reporting on KGB operations involving Americans appear in the

HARISTONE case, where he has given conflicting information on the

KGB's ability to obtain photographic evidence of his homosexuality,

and in his advice on how to identify "ANDREY"--that he was the only

witness to testify in Roy RHCDS' trial and that he did not testify

at Roy RHODES! trial but was only interviewed in the pre-trial in-

vestigation once.

Part VIII.U. covers the extent of his knowledge

about American cases in which he took part personally or as a

supervisor.

Regarding

others to which his official positions did

not give him access, NOSENKO has indicated that it was his per-

sonal contact with KGB colleagues which

enabled him to report on

nine recruitments (Herbert HONARD,

Sam jAFFE, the KGS agent in

rrance.

the YOUNGER couple, "SASHA"; and two unnamed agents in.

Geneval, three development

cases (George VAY LAETHEM,

Attorney

General Robert KENNEDY,

and Stephen HOFFM): three unsuccessful

recruitment approaches (Richard HARNSTONE, Peter BINDER, and

Collette SCHWARZENBACT); and three investigations (Thomas BARTHE-

LEMY, LEwiS BO.DSN, and George WINTERS).

NOSENKO'S alleged asso-

ciates in the ka thus gave him the names of four recruited agents

and gufficient details for one more to be identified by subsequent

investigation, JOISON.

All of the NOSENKO leads to developmental

operations, unsuccessful recruitment approaches, and investigations

have been identified.

(11) Damage to the Soviets

Three criteria can be used in assessing the harm to Soviet

interests caused

by NOSENKO's operational leads to Americans:

First, the originality of his information on recruited

agents and

unsuccessful recruitment approaches;

Second, the agents' access to classified information

at the time

he reported on then; and

Third, the possibility of identifying them on the

basis of the details provided or in croii:. ion viti details

=eceivad from other sources.

There is no reason to believe that NOSENKO's information on 22

Americans under investigation while in the USSR could have damaged

the KGB, especially since all of them had left the Soviet Union

before the NOSENKO leads were received (Pages 402-410).

-other-category, -NOSENKO's leads. to.35 Americans under development

(Pages 379-397), there is no means for evaluating their impor-

tance

to the KGB because i: is impossible to estimate with con-

fidence the likelihood of the KGB recruiting some or any of these

targeta, vulnerability and assessment data, wher coupled with

spasmodie or even continuing KGB access to

the target, would be

no quarantee that he is recruitable.

Nevertheless,

the criteria listed above, NOSE.K0'g statements on KGB operation-

al interest sterming from their homosexuality did bring about the

recall of Robert ARMSTRONG and Stephen HOFFMAN from the U.S.

Embassy in Moscow.

NOSENKO was the first source to report on the KGS recruit-

ments of 22 tourists inone with access to classified meterials

four correspondents lone said by NOSiKO to have become inactive

of whom there was previous derogatory information):

the American Express Company representative in Mosco: a contrari.

employee of USIA who had earlier declared his intent to marry a

Soviet national; and two agents whose names were not known to

NOSENKO but who were identiflable.

The latter two agents were:

- Doyle W. SMITH (XGB cryptonym "ANDREY"), a cipher

machine mechanic at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow recruited in

Despite NOSENKO'g statement that "AYDREY" was current-

ly supplying valuable information in June 1962, SMITH 105t

his access to classified information through retirement from

the U.S. Army on 30 November 1961, or about six months before

NOSENKO first reported on him (Pages 413-426).

- U.S. Army Sergeant Robert Lee JOHNSO, who with his

Wife Hedwig began collaborating with the KGB in 1952 and

who made James MINTKENBAUGH an agent of the KGB in 1953

(Pages 427-462) .

Hedwig JOINSCY discontinued her role in

the operation in 1953, although thereafter remaining know

ledgeable of the KGB activities of her husband and MINTKEN

BAUGH, according to MINTKENBAUGH, who lost access to classi-

fied information in 1954, he had no direct contact with the

KGB after the late summer or early autumn of 1953 (about

three to five months before NOSENKO first gave the lead on

JOHNSON): JOHNSON was still on active duty with the U.s.

Army and in contact with the KGB when NOSEIKO reported in

January 1964 about the existence of this agent.

Thus from a total of 30 original and identifiable leads, only one

agent had access to classified information as of the date when

NOSENKO's reporting on him began.

By the criteria given in the

preceeding paragraph, the single

operational lead from NOSENKO

which could have damaged Soviet interests was that which un

covered JOHNSON.

It is debatable, however, whether the JOH'SO! lead consti-

tuted a serious loss to the KGB.

In the first place, if JOHNSON

can be believed, he gave the Soviets but one classified document

while in charge of the "C'assified Control Center" at Camp Des

Loges between August 1963 and May 1964.

His KGB case officer

later told him, JOHNSO:! said, that the information he could pro-

vide was not worth the risk involved and that no future attempts

of this sort should be made.

JOHNSON also stated that he felt

his espionage work at Camp Des Loges had not been very profitable

for the Soviets,

adding that his case officer had shown dis

interest in his proposal to obtain for the KGP a top secret

document he (JOHNSON) thought of greater importance than any

other to which he had access.

(NOSENKO indicated that JOHNSON

lost his access in the spring of 1963, while at the Orly Courier

Station.

In the second place, as the KGB knew, the

of liedwig JOHNSON, a mental case, was unpredictable.

threesome as difficult handling problems. Given these apparent

factors, the NOSENKO lead may have been

considered expencable by

the KGB, without jung-lasting adverse effect on che luifillrest

of its overall intelligence requirements.

ROSENKO was the first source to identify James STORSBEFG, a

U.S. military code clerk stationed at the Mosco: Embassy, as a

target who had rejected the KGB's recruitment offer (Pages 165-

The information was received from NOSENKO after STORSBERG

the U.S. Army,

and when interviewed on the

of this infortation,

STORSBERG generally confirzed NCSENKO'g

GOLITSYN had

earlier seportes on what may

have been the same KGB operation,

but coLIrsy.i believed the mili-

tary code clerk had been recruited; from what GOLITSYN had pre-

viously told CIA and from later investigations,

it seems possible

that the KGB recruited either STOKSBERG or Wilitar HURLEY (who

NOSENKO said was rut recruited or approached by trè kG3). If it

is assumed that STORSBERG was not recruited in the approach de

scribed by NOSENKO and in the operation discussed by GOLITSYN,

suffered no loss in the American services learning of

is assumed on the other hand that STORSBERG Or

HURLEY was recruited,

the reporting by Nosauro assisied the KGB--

not the Aterican

services--by

deflecting security investigations

from a recruited agent of che KGB.

•(iii) Importance or Usefulness

The American leads from NOSENKO enabled U.S. security author-

ities to:

- Confirm previous information on the recruitments of

13 tourists and three correspondeats;

- Verify previous derogatory information on ll tourists,

two correspondents, and perhaps ore military code clerk.

STORSBERG:

- Remove two homosexuals from the U.S. Embassy in

Moscow; and

- Identify 32 KGB agents including Hedwig JOHNSON and

MINTKENBAUGH.*

One or possibly two of these 32 agents (SMITH and possibly HOARD)

past had been in a position to pass classified information

to the KGB, and a third (JOHNSON) had current access to classified

information and current contact with the KGB; the two honosexuals

at the Moscow Embassy

(APMSTRONG and HOFFMAN) presurably also had

access to classified infornation.

From the standpoint of pro-.

tecting_the_security of the U.S:

Government, NOSENKO brought to

an end the JOiNSON operation and the KGB's potential for récruit

ing ARMSTRONG and HOFFMAN.

Against this product of NOSENKO's reporting must be balanced

of money and manpower that were needed for U.S. secu

rity authorities

to exhaust and investigate NOSENKOg information

49 recruitments, 35 developmental targets, seven unsuccessful

recruitment approaches, ard 33 investigations by the KGB-a total

of 113 operational leads.

and interrogation of NOSEKO on these cases, but the investigative

work in the United States was accomplished mostly by other

agencies.

It would seem, however, that the JOHNSON operation

was the only NOSEKO lead to be important or useful.

(2V) Remarks

Judged by his major inaccuracies and by the demonstrable in-

completeress in some

of his reporting, NOSENKO is not an authori-

rative or reliable

source of information on operationg against

Americans by the U.S. invassy Section and the imerican Tourist

Section.

Proven

untrustwortny in other categories of operational

leads, there is no reason to accept at face

value NOSENKO's state-

ment that smiTh was the only loscow enoassy enployee workiry with

the KGS from

1953 through 1063; indeed, evicence to the contrary

exists.

The

sane may be true

regarding Anericar tourists and

correspondents

in Moscow, i.e., other recruitments not mentioned

by NOSENKO could have occurred.

Purchermore,

with the question-

able exception

of the JOHNSGY case, the KGB lost nothing of great

value in consequence of NOSENKO's leads but garred an advantage

by occupyirg the

attention and facilities of Auerican security

authorities.

It is therefore concluded that NOSENKO has withhold infor-

mation on recruitrents of Americans in !loscow,

or he is unable to

provide a comprehensive review of such activities because he did

not hold the claired positions in the U.S. Encassy and American

Tourist Sections.

Either explanation forces strong reservations

about the bona fides of NOSENKO as a genuine source, and these

reservations

reinforced by the relative costs to the KGB and

U.S. security authorities

of the NOSENKO leads.. By itself, this

evaluation of his production on American cases

suggests the possi

bility that the KGB dispatched NOSENKO to report to CIA, and that

the KGB did so for the parpose of misleading the U.S. security

less were well en their way to identifying the source of the

Admiralty documents identifled bu GOLITSYN.

When they received the fragment of NOSENKO information which

focused on the British Embassy in Moscow, the number was reduced

to VASSALI and one other.

Although the NOSENKO information

apparently confined the already solid suspicions of VASSALL,

there is reason to belleve that the identification would have

been accomplished without this information.

The lead was there-

fore not nev or exclusive information, and NOSENKO himself ad-

mitted in 1964 that he krew that GOLITSYN had know of the case

trary evidence.

In the case of foreign tourists his leads show

ard he himself has cormented--that

such recruitments were of no

particular value; assuming that NUSEVKO was Deputy

Chiet of th:

Tourist Department, he should be able to make such a statement

without challenge.

To date no independent

evidence of foreign

tourist recruitments has emerged which contradicts him.

Opera-

tions against other western

embassies in Moscow are a slightly

different matter.

NOSENKO's information, or lack thereof,

can-

not be evaluated on the basis of completeness because he has made

no claim to full

access to such information or to positiong

which

would have given

him better access. Except for tiose he said he

was informed of in connection with possibie use

against U.S.

embassy targets, he has usually sourced such third-national

leads

as he did have to particularly close relationg with the

responsible case officer.

It would not be valid to argue that

« source of

one lead should have told him of others, or that he

should have had more close friends in the KGB.

Thus on all

applicable criteria,

the NOSENKO leads to operationg

against

third-rationals must be excluded as a factor weighing for or

against his bona fides.

able to explain why he would need this list to know the locations

flarly, it was never clear why NOSENKO did not remember in 1962

NOSE*O's account of how the product from the microphones was

Americans might take on the basis of NOSENKO's statements could

reflect dangerously ca him as the source.*

Accepting at face value NOSENKO's claimed lack of aptitude

and interest in technical matters, and therefore nis inability

to provide

specific technical details concerning electronic oper-

ations against the American Embassy, it is seill noteworthy that:

- NOSENKO did not know the purpose of the so-called

"Moscow bear, "

sometimes saying it was to jam Embassy

communications and at other times that it was used to

- Although he claimed to have personally pa-ticipated

istence or the purpose of the coaxial cables and grill

insisted that there

were no audio devices installed in the

North Wing at the time of its, renovation for occupancy

by Americans.)

• NOSENKO knew nothing of the general lines of research

and development to substitute for or improve the fading

microphone coverage of the U.S. Embassy.

These three points relate to aspects of the KGE's audio-technical

attack on the U.S. Embassy in which the reporting of a source in

NOSENKO's claimed position, no matter what his technical aptitude.

could have been detrimental to Soviet interests.

That they both knew of the micro-

phones suggests that NOSENKO exaggerated the sensitivity o

the microphone eperation, which had moreover always been

assumed by the Embassy to be active.

Remarka

NOSENKO's sourcing of his information on electronie opera-

tions against the U.S. Embassy in Noscow was unclear and unlikely.

His knowledge of the location and production of these microphones.

as well as the existence,

nature, and purpose of other electronic

operationg directed against the Enbassy, was not commensurate with

his alleged position in the U.S. Embassy Section ard his particu-

lar responsibility for audio perations.

Significartly, the

as an outgrowth of action on

GOLITSYN's information, would have led to all the others.

Thus

the Embassy microphones must have beer cor.sidered by the

KCB to

have been compromised kefore NOSENKO first spoke of them in 1962.

idle to this is the fact (supported by NOSENKO hlmself) that

1':. efficiency of the Embassy microphone installation as a whole

had seriously diminished by late 1961 or early 1962 due to, first,

normal deterioration of equiprent and wiring and, second.

the

installation of

secure rooms and the impletentation of more

stringent security precautions at the Embassy.

For these reasons

and in the absence of any information concerring other forms of

electronic

attack against the U.S. Embassy in Moscod, it cannot

be considered that the information provided by lOSEiKO in 1962

and 1964 was harmful to the interests of the KGB nor helpful to

American authorities.

NOSENKO's denial of any installations

in

the north wing, in the light of the later discovery there of

coaxial cables, the purpose of which appears serious and is as

yet unclarified, and in the light of NOSSNKO's specific claim to

have been responsible for the operational plarning for the north

wing at the time it was being prepared for Aterican occupancy,

would appear to be purposeful deception.

he wanted to sell) that he of its agents, the Soviet interpreter

BELITSKIY, was in fact a KGB double agent who had been planted on

CIA (Pages 517-529) •

NOSENKO said that this was a case run by the

Second

("'Active Line") Section, but that he personally had a role

in the management of the case in May 1962 in Geneva. NOSENKO was

able to give certain

inside information on this case; for example,

NOSENKO's information, at least in its general outlines, was

CIA had been running BELITSKIY as an agent, and the CIA

case officers (alias "Bob" and "Henry," the latter from Washington

as NOSENKO said nad just completed a series of meetings with

BELITSKIY in Geneva.

inaccurate:

BELITSKIY had been recruited a year before NOSENKO'g

and in Brussels, not Lordon.

Also, NOSEVKO's claim

that this was a Second Chief Directorate operation aimed at en-

ticing CIA into meetings in the USSR was not borne out by the

history of the case

or by EELITSKIY'5 conduct, although it cannot

be excluded that this was a long-term objective which the KGB

still sought without appearing to.

NOSENKO ' S

account of the case

thus is not as accurate as could be expected if his own role in

it had been as claimed.

NOSENKO's description of his own involvement is not consis-

tent with observed Soviet practice or with operational logic.

NOSENKO said in both 1962 and 1964 that he had had orders to

supervise the handling of this case in Geneva in the spring of

The reason was that the case officer for BELITSKIY in

Ger.eva (ARTEMEV) was young and inexperienced and had not even

worked on the BELITSKIY case before.

NOSENKO was sayirg in

effect--with the authority of direct knowledge and official re-

sponsibility--that BELITSKIY, a prominent Soviet citizen having

personal contacts

with well placed menbers of the Soviet Govern

ment, a man who had beer under the ostensible control of a hos

tile intelligence service (CIA) for four years, was sent by the

KGB to Geneva for the purpose of recontacting CIA, with pre-

pared information, but that the KOB did not send with him the

responsible case officer or any member of the section responsible

for the operation.

Instead, the KGB turned over the responsi-

bility to a young

inexperienced KGB officer who happened to

be in Geneva to protect the

security of a delegation and who

had had no prior connection with

the BELITSKIY case nor ever

local knowledge of Geneva conditions; then,

after BELITSKIY was

already in Geneva,

the KGB had cabled instructiong that NOSENKO,

no need to know of the case and had learned of it only

unofficially from conversations in 1960-1961 with the Section

Chief responsible, who had

no experience or training in handl-

ing double agent operations, ard who was similarly in Geneva

by chance with delegation security functions, should quide the

other "less experienced" case officer.*

As NOSENKO showed

under questioning, he did not know the contents of any of the

positive intelligence BELITSKlY was to pass to CIA

mation; he did not know BELITSKIY'& Moscow or Geneva pattern

of movement or contacts; he did not know in detail hos or when

the operation

started; he did not krow the nature of degree o

British involvement, nos the operational details and contact

arrangements.

NOSE!iKO said that BELITSKIY had been placed on a

Geneva delegation in the hope that CIA might be able to "find"

and recontact him."*

C. Remarks

The circumstances above not only cast doubt on NOSENKO's

version of the case and his own accesg but also suggest that

NOSENKO did not have a theoretical appreciation of hoi double

agentg are handled.

The examples he gave of his "guidance" to

ARTEMEV are few in number.

NOSENKO also stated in 196÷ that he

had arranged the actual introduction to iSI.ITSKIY of XISLOV, the

TASS man, to provide for BELITSKIY's need of a notioral subsource

for some of his disinformation; NOSENKO by October 1966 had appar-

ently forgotten this event, for he stated unequivocally that kis

LOV had had no

connection whatever with the BELITSKIY case. NOS-

ENKO claimed to have met RELITSKIY, but did not recognize his

photo when shown it in 1966.

Did NOSENKO's report to CIA on the BELITSKIY case harm the

doubts of BELITSKIY & bona fides, CIA was handling

" NOSENKO has reported that he handled only one American agent

ARTEMEV had had extended contact

as early as August 1958, a role in other opera

tions against American tourists in 1959-including clandestine

search (see Page 148), and continuous American Department

service since then.

NOSENKO did not know of the 1353-1959

operational activities of ARTEMEV, although they feil in the

operational area NOSENKO claimed to have supervised at the

time as Deputy Chief of the American Tourist Section.

of the dangers inherent in having disinformation recognized as

The meetings in Geneva in May 1962 would have made it

clear to the KGB that CIA had no intentiong of meeting BELITSKIY

Inside the USSR, and, in KGB eyes, the case may have reached the

point of dininishing returns.

It is perhaps significant that

NOSENKO did not contact CIA and report on the BELITSKIY case until

10 days after BELITSKIY's series of meetings with CIA in Geneva

nad been completed, which would have given the KGB time for final

appraisad of the operation's potential.

NOSENKO's account of his own role in this operation appears

to have been false,

and nothing in the available evidence would

preclude Sovict sacrifice of this already tired operation.

Since

NOSENKO provided some inside details of a sensitive KCB operation

which could have been known to only a few, it is difficult to

find any other explanation of NOSENKO's access to.this information

except that the KGB briefed him about it.

The only other evidence available is analytical. POPOV was

transferred to the Illegals handling unit in Berlin on 28 June

1957, an assignment of high sensitivity. Urtil mid-August he

handled five illegals, thereafter only one, TAIROVA, in October

1957. • Following home leave from 12 December 1957 to 19 January

1958, he was again transferred, this time to à position where

Illegals and productive GRU sources of intelligence were not ex

posed to him.

between March and November 1958 there were signg

of a KGB investigation of the Illegals handling. unit where POPOV

formerly served, and he was recalled to Moscow in November of that

year.

These facts can be interpreted as follows::

- POPOV's status as a CIA source was not compromised before

his transfer to the Illegals handling unit.

POPOV'g status was compromised before his recall to roscod

in November 1958, probably before his reassigment from the

Illegals handling unit in January 1958, and possibly some time

earlier.

The latter possibility is apparent from the Soviets®

knowledge that the TAIROVA couple was

under surveillance in

December 1957 (and until March 1958); it is also noteworthy

that, after having met five Illegals in less than one and one-

half months prior to 13 August 1957, POPOV subsequently was

involved personally with only one other. TAIROVA, in October

1957.

- The KGB, realizing that POPOV was a CIA source, chose to

keep him in Berlin

until November 1958 in order to

investigate

the possibility of his operating in conjunction with other

CIA SOUrCES.

This line of reasoning, if accepted, would confirm COLITSYN's in-

formation that a KGB agent compromised POPOV prior to the arrival

of ZHUKOV in Berlin, an arrival date falling some time before

23 November 1957.

(Footnotes from preceding page.)

*****Since such orientation papers are written for general circula-

tion within the KGB, it is doubtful that KGB security prac-

tices would permit their conterts to reveal sensitive infor-

mation; other sources have indicated that orientation papers

sometimes are sanitized; this particular paper, however,

reportedly did

state that the KGB learned from

an agent

in

about 1957 (GOLITSYN's estimate) that American Intelligence

had a source which had provided GRU information.

#This date, which is consistent with that cited in the final

sentence

of the preceeding footnote, was derived from the

time when

POPOV reported the presence of the KGB officer

ZHUKOV in Berlin: according to GOLITSYN,

ZHUKOV was sent to

Berlin after POPOV had been identified by a KGB agent as

being a source of CIA.

c. COMprOriSe of CHEREPANIOV

(1) Introduction

NOSENKC®& stories on the compromises of POPOV and PENKOV..

SKIY were examined for their accuracy as to tiring and cause. In

the case of CHEREPANOV (Pages 548-558), there is no question

about

when the so-called CHEREPANOV papers were passed, nor how the KGB

openly learned of the U.S. Embassy's possession

of the papers.

The chief question is the

authenticity of the cocuments

themselves,

with the subsidiary implications, if they are not authentic, that

the passage of the papers was instigated by the KGB, and that

there could have been neither a compromise of nor a search for

CHEREPAYOY, as described by NOSENKO

and attested to by his travel

authorization (see

also Part VIII.D.8.).

(11) The Operational Plan in Draft

Examiration of oné draft document--the operational plan

against the CIA officer WINTERS--reveals the following points

related to for:

- Although only a draft, the title of the case officer.

the designation of his office, the title of his supervisor

as approving authority, and the designation of his office

component as well as the title of the confirming authority

(the head of the department) are spelled out in full, even

including the subordination of the KGB to the Council of

Ministers of the USSR.

KGB practice, as reported by

other sources and as logic would dictate, does not require

that this be done, cumbersome as these desigrations are,

and the typist routinely fills them in as the official

copy is typed from the draft.

- Although only a draft, this document has been signed

by KOVSHUK as being approved, which is against common

sense and KGB practice.

NOSENKO himself noted this dis

crepancy, asking himself aloud why KOVSHUK had done this.

- Although only a draft, the name of the target of

the plan appears several times, but earlier KGB defectors

have stated and NOSENKO himself has confirmed that the

name is left out of drafts

so the typist in the typing

pool will not krow the identity of the

subject of the

report; a blank line is used wherever the name is to

appear to be filled in by hand by the case officer after

the document comes back from the typist.

- On the basis of references to LANGELLE and POPOV,

this

plan (which

is not dated) would have to have been

drafted sometime

after October 1959.

WINTERS by this

time had been in

Moscow since August 1958, had been de-

tected in operational letter-mailing, and hai been

associating wich KGB officers, etc.

and

he 16 always referred to in true name, but this 1s contrary

to the usage in the other operational plans in the package.

It is also contrary

to KGB practice, as described by NOSeY-

KO and other sources.

- The draft cited several technical aids to be used in

the clandestine study of INTERS.

It not only gives the KGB

cryptonym of metra and "iéptun-80" for two of these techni-

ques, but irmediately thereafter explains for what purpose

each one uf them is used. In the other operational plans

from CHEREPANOV, and in conformance wich the established

KGB practice of

inserting cryptonvms for such devices.

these preparations are not only not descrihed. but the

blank Line typed by the typist has been filled in by hand

after typing.

In addition to the above points of form, this same dociment

contains statements which run counter to rigid KGB practice and

which

are internally contradictory, espacially noteworthy in an

approved draft. One of the objectives arnourced in the plan 1s

to investigate two Soviet citizens who were detected in contact

with

in Moscow; one of the two is identified parenthetic-

ally as having gone abroad.

This document, if genuine, would be

an admission

on the part of the case officer.

and an approval

thereof by his supervisor, that a Soviet citizen who had been

observed in contact with an identified officer of American Intel-

ligence had been cleared by the KGB for travel abroad before the

nature of that contact had been satisfactorily determined by the

in contradiction to all available information con-

cerning KGB travel clearances, which are denied on the basis of

unauthorized contacts between

soviet citizens and foreigners in

the Soviet Union, not to mention Nesterr. Intelligence officers.

The draft, which corsists of only three paragraphs, can be su-

marized briefly by paragraph to demonstrate the intenal contra-

dictions:

- To establish the nature of MINTERS: intelligence

activities in the USSR, six speciäl tasks will be carried

including round-the-clock surveillance, metka.

"Neptun-80," hijden microphones, other audio-devices.

and investigation of already identified Soviet citizens.

- Because he already been identified

and he has a hostile attitude tovard the

USSR, there is no basis for recruitment: therefore the

actions outlined in the first paragraph will not be

carried out because they might alarm him and cause him

to leave the USSR prematurely.

- Despite the statements of the second paragraph,

which indicate that recruitment is out of the question

and which precludes putting into effect the measures

outlined in the first paragraph, this third paragraph

sets forth the expectation that just before wIlTERs.

tion of materials on NINTERS and the prevailing polit-

of a draft which had been or was about to be made a matter of

official KGB record.

corsiderations in preparstion constitutes

alse is pertinent

to the authenticity of the papers and of NOSENKO's accourt on

CHEREPANOV.

is a short summary of the operational activity

of the CIA officer LANGELLE,

covering the compromise of POFOV.

The document says do part:

"Ir. January 1959 a letter with secret

writing mailed by a co-worker of the Embassy of the USA 11 Moscow,

WINTERS, was intercepted and was addressed to a Soviet citizen.

POPOV, a worker of the General Staff of the Soviet Army.

ing to the cortents of the letter, it was clearly established

that FOFOV was an American agert..."

This coincides precisely with NOSENKO's accourt of POPOV's

compromise (see Pages 532 and 653).

Unlike COLITSYN's recollec-

tion of the official report which he read, there is no reference

in this document to the report of about 1957 from ar agent source

that there was a leak of GRU irformation; nor is there reference

to the indication that the KGS knew that LANGELLE had been posted

to Moscow in order to handle a special agent, for this reason

placing LAIGELLE under heavy surveillance.

If both of these

items were in the official report which CoLITSYli read, their

omission from the sumary report in what purports to be CHERE-

The document further stated that the dead

ligence who had recently been arrested by the Mosco. KGB. Two

errors of fact in this passago belie KGB practice as known from

many sources!

cases in the same general area of the Lenin Hills park.

Since it is a fact that LANGELLE did not pur down a dead

arop on either occasion. KGB gurveillance could not have

seen him do so.

If the KGS nad reason to suspect that he

had done so, but could not locate it

in the case of ABIDIAN and the Pushkin Street drop--to put

24-hour surveillance on the area for a reasonable length

of time, in order to apprehend the agent for whom it was

intended.

The dead drop was not actually put down until

7 June 1958 (during twilight), ten days after the second

casing.

Assuming the KGB had not stopped its coverage

of the area after only ten days, the CIA agent who did

put down the dead drop must have been observed doing this.

CHEREPANOV's note thus erred by attributing to LANGELLE

an action which the KGB knew he had not taken and which

the KGB almost certainly kned someore else had taken.

- At the time the dead drop

was out down, it had not

been designated for any agent, REPNIKOV ircluded. It

was a contingency dead drop, to be activated at some

time in the future as necessary; the agent for whom it

might have been designated could conceivably not even

be recruited until long after the dead drop was loaded.

REPNIKOV, identified in the document as the person in-

tended to unload it, was not a recruited agent of Ameri-

can Intelligence either at the time of the drop-loading ,

or at any cine thereafter: neither was any dead drop

(iv) Remarks

That at least two of the documenta were not authentic is

evidence that the CHEREPANOV papers were designed by the KGB

for American Intelligence consumption.

There is no sensitive information contained in any of the

documents; that is, they are not worth the risk of stealing

either in helping the west or damaging the KgB.

It is further

questionable how CHEREPAVOV was able to steal drafts destined

for destruction which are dated August 1958, March 1959, and so

on, if he had not acquired his motivation of bitterness

the KGB until 1961, as indicated by NOSENKO and other sources.

It is also possible to question numerous other aspects of the

CHEREFANOV case, some dating from the eariiest known history of

the man and others nore recent..

This seems unnecessary in view

of the analysis of the WINTERS document and the LANGELLS summary.

It follows that the CHEREPANOV incident was a provocative

plan of the KGB.

ROSENKO's story about CHEREPANOV, a mutually

confirming source on KGB affairs, must be interpreted as an

indication that he has deliberately lied in reporting

CHEREPANOV case and his part in the investigation, now shown

to have been spurious.

He has also lied in attesting to the

validity of the CHEREPANOV documents and thereby to the validity

own information on the same topics which those documents

also covered.

In the case of Edward Ellis SMITil (Pages 458-469) , the U.S.

of the objective facts of the case led him into statements con-

cerning his own knowledge of the case which

cannot be true.

to recruit S:ITH, but he admitted after the defection. that these

Remarks

NOSENIO's errors concerning "ANDREY" /particularly his early

insistence that "ANUREY" had loft Moscca years before NOSENiO en-

tered the KGB) make i. impossible that NOSESKO could have learned

of the case in the say he lates said he did.

NOSENIO's accounts of how he learned of the "Paris agent"-are

vague and vary with each telliag; chey

also depend hearily on coin-

cidence.

It is noteworthy too that he clained to have been told of

this one operation by no less than four individuals, thereas the

rest of what he learned of First Chief Directorate operations in

eleven years of KGB service came from only two

other individuals.

Furthernore, his krowledge of "SASHA" stembed fron elaborate and

apparently contrived sourcing which he himself vas

unable to recon-

struct when pressed for exact details.

SOSENKO's inbility

give any clear and consistent account of hor he heard of either the

"Paris agen:" or "SAShA" must be judged in ine likir of the face that

he first heard of both cases only just after promisite to collect

such inforcation

for CIA.

because these here arcig ine rost lapor-

tant and the nost fortuitous items he ever picked up, it could

reasonably be expected that he sould remember how he

did so, espe-

cially since only a little over a year elapsed until his next

reeting with ClA.

NOSENKO's sourcing for there

illogical and fabricated.

It also appears that sU:ENiO has given an

inaccurate version

of the way in which he would have learned or

D. Ernaination of HOSENKO's Intelligence Carcer

1. Introduction

What follows

is an examination of NOSEYKO's accounts of his

Soviet Intelligence career, beginning with

the yearg 1951 and

1952, 1D the naval GRU and continuing with his ll sears in the

U.s.

Embassy Section and the Tourist Department of the KGB Sec-

ond Chief Directorate.

SOSENKO's naval service opens the dis

cussion primarily because, according to his story, it provided

a springboard for bis entrance into the KGB in 1953 with the

rank of lieutenant.

The discussion of each

period in his career has two con

tral topics:

First.

NOSENKO'g own description of his positions,

responsibilities,

and access: and second, ar assessment of this

description

fron the point of view of internal consistency,

accuracy, and the commensurability of his knowledge, operational

activities, and performance with his claimed senior and respon

sible posts with the KGB and his rise to these posts. This

assessment is based on a corparison of the inforsation supplied

by NOSENKO with

collateral

information from a variety of overt,

official, defector, and clandestine sources.

NOSENKO's accounts of the various periods in his career are.

of course, cumulative in that his claimed positiors and activi-

tles during one stage necessarily affect those of succeeding

periods.

as possible, each period is evaluated wittin

itself and independently of conclusions earlier reacted.

2. Naval GRU Service

a. Introduction

NOSENXO'g accountg* of his naval GRU service (Pages: 64-77)

have been revieved for their internal consistency and credibility,

and examined for accuracy against information from other sources.

b. Discussion

Briefly, the outlines of NOSENKO's account of his military

service are about as

follows:

_ He studied for the equivalent of 7th, 8th, gth and

part of 10th

school years in naval schools

in Kuibyshev, Baku

and Leningrad.

This would normally have nothing to do with

military service, except that NOSENKO says he took the mili-

cary oath at the

Baku School in the fall of 1943, at the

Also, he shot hinself in the hand only about two months

Relations in Moscow.

branch of the service he was in, except that it was not the

twice and this went on his record.

by a mandate connission at the Institute.

However, he

the service-until succesgful re-examination later that

to a Stale criminal's daughter, rejectior. for iGB employ-

ment, And a bad academic record including failure of a

course in Harrism-leninism just at thie-tine.

- He was called to active duty as a senior lieutenant

and without any indoctrination or train

ng, he doparted four or five days later in civilian clothes

for his flage duty station, Sovietskaya Gavan in the Soviet

Far East.

NOSENKO claims to have chosen this post, con-

sidered generally to be the least desirable of all naval

assignnents, on his own initiative, to prove to hig father

that ne wor a man.

(Tre above was his account in 1966, in

all carlier accounts he said he went to the Soviet Far

on the fall of 1950, and in fact said that he had two months

leave in 1952, one for each of two jears there.

However,

according

40 the 1956 account, his

service there lasted only

one year.)

- In covetskaya Gavan'hOStlikO's job was to extract ir-

formation iron Inerican publications reporting naval de-

velopments.

Asked in April 1964 for any personal account

of his own work, HOSENKO was able to think of oniy "four or

five trips" on

small ships to the coast of Sakhalin,* and

three

to Mutikaido, to drop or pick up agents. His own role,

he said,

wis as a trainee; he was taken along only "to iearn

how it was done;" he himself never trained or dispatched any

agents, nor did

he know the identities cor missions ce any

others.

Is also could not descrike the ships he had travelled

Questioned on

the location of Sovetskaya Gavan' in 1965,

NOSENKO insisted that this

city is Iccated

in Primorskiy

ing to other accounts, because of having contracted tubercu-

losis) in April 1952.

lie then spent two months either in

his parents' Moscow hone of, according to other accounts, in

a sanitorius near Moscow under treatment for tuberculosis.

He said he was coughing up "half a glass of biood at a time."

(X-rays and medical

examinations from February 1964 have

detected no indications that NOSENKO ever suffered from

tuberculosts.)

- At this time, the summer of 1952, NOSENKO said he was

offered in Moscod ar opportunity to attend the GRU strategic

intelligence school, the Military-Diplonatic Avademy, but

turned it down because he had already studied most of the

course matter in the Institute of International Affairs: ba-

sides, NOSEiKO said in October 1966, he failed the physical

examination when sugar was discovered in hig faeces.

• NOSEIKO was then transferred--without returning to

the Far East--to the Intelligence Staff of the Baltic Fleet

at Baltiyss. He irverted a story in 1964 about going there

In October T156 NOSENKO was asked whether he had ever been

to Sakhalin; his anster was no.

nitz, but then said this was a lie he told because he felt

his interrogators would not believe hit if se had said he

successfully turned down an assignment to these points,

then closing down, and had travelled directly to Baltiyak.

- He could not remerber the nane of the place he aerved

He had named it as Primorsk in 1962 (which

fitted his description of its size and location) but from

1964 on insisted it was Sovetsk.

There is no such village

in the area, but there is in the region a well-known city

by that name (the former Tilsit) far inland ard far away.

Under interrogation in 1964 he changed his description

of his functions, saying he merely prepared training mater-

ials and delivered supplies, never

having direct contact with

or knowledge of the agent work.

His service there was

limited to about six months,

since he said he left there at

the beginning of 1953. He either had had cne or two leaves

from there,

depending

on which telling is accepted:

NOSENKO said that in August or September 1952 he was given

a special leave fron his duties in Sovetsk to travel to M0g-

cow in order to formalize his divorce from his first wife;

in April 1956 he wrote that he was divorced during his leave

befoze going to Sovetsk.

tive and against the wishes of his commanding officer at the

end of 1952 and began steps to get out of the GRU.

It was during this period, he said, that

conversation with KOBULOV led him to shift to the KGB.

- In April 1966 NOSENKO wrote that he was promoted to

the rank of lieutenant of the Administrative Services while

stationed in Sovetsk.

In earlier accounts he said that he

was promoted to the rank of lieutenant while stationed

the Soviet Far East.

NOSE: KO's description of his naval GPU service cannot be

accepted as true.

On the basis

of his statements, it appears

moreover that he was never a naval officur, nor an officer of any

other regular military service.

Since NOSENKO clains that his GIU status and service provided

him the platform for a transfer into the KGB (without guch for-

malities as medical examination, personnel interviews or question-

naires), this conclusion

is relevant to his claim of KGB staff

status from

1952 or 1953.

NOSENKO has

separate occasiong that his illness was a matter

of record with the Gru,

and that the reason he did not have to

take a physical examination for entry into the KGB was the avail

ability of GRU records.

According to DERYABIN, however, KGB

regulations at that time would have preciuded admission to KGB

ranks if there was a recent history of tuberculosis even though

already arrested.

b. Date of Entry

NOSENKO has given a variety of dates for his entry on duty

with the KGB

and has provided severa! reasons for his changes of

story (Pages 36-89).

During nis

first reeting with ClA, when

NOSENKO gave a brief personal and professional autobiography, he

said that he had joined the KGB i?. February or March 1953.

1964, however, first while scill attached to the Soviet Disarma

ment

Delegation and later when reviewing and signing a bio-

graphic history prepared by CIA on the basis of his own account,

NOSENKO set this date back a year, to early 1952.

During the

interrogations of April 1964, after naming several other dates?

NOSENKO returned to the original one, March 1953,

and has remained

with this version since that time.

NOSENKO has given two adE

ferent reasons for this change of dates (which,

he said in Octo

ber 1966, was conscious deception).

In the April 1964 interrogations,

he explained that he had failed his examination in Marxism-leninism

at the Institute of International iffairs, which forced him to

exams over again and delayed his career: This was

"unpleasant, * NOSENKO said,

and he was attempting to conceal it

1966 interrogations, NOSENKO

gave a new

and different reason.

He described hod he had been rejected for

employment by State

Security while at the Institute and was trying

to cover up for this because he thought CIA would not believe

that he had first been rejected and then, later, accepted by the KGB.

NOSENRO's change of story tock place in 1964 while still in the

relatively relaxed circumstances of an operational meeting in

Geneva; he came back to his original account only during the

April 1964 interrogations.

NOSENKO's explanations of why he re-

vised the story have been

inconsistent and have forced him into

further inconsistencies.

Because of this and, in the absence of

any pressure of any kind (including any apparent psychological

pressurel to lie about his date of entry, the most logical explana

tion for this change is that HOSENKO forgot in early 1964 either

when he joined the KGB and/or what he had told CIA in 1952.

DERYAEIN has commerted on the significarce which the date of entry

holds for a KGB officer.

He expressed the opinion that it would

be unusual for a KGB officer to forget this date.

NOSENKO waS GUeStioned at length by DERYABIN

(Pages 616-619)

concerring the tiring of his entry on duty with the kge.

As a

result of this irterrogation it was determined that NOSENKO wag

unavare that at the time he said he joined the KGB, the present

First Chief Directorate was designated the Secord Chief Direc-

torate and vice versa.

Therefore, NOSENSO would have joined a

component entitled the First Chief Directorate in March 1953,

not the Second Chief Directorate as he says.

NOSENKO did not

know or had forgotten various other facts,

including the date

that the MVD was redesignated the KCB, and migstated the loca-

tiors and existence of various buiidings and offices

in

the

vicinity of the KGB Headguarters buildirg in early 1953.

Ir. June 1962 NOSENKO said several times, in different meet-

ings, that the kGB agent "ANDREY" (Pages 413-414) had been re-

cruited and had left Moscow before he,

le estimated the date as 1949-1950.

NOSENKO knew that

was associated in Moscow with RiODIS and when told that RHODES

was trere from 1951 to 1953, admitted that the date he gave might

be wrong.

NOSENKO continued to say, however, that "ANDREY" was

recruited before he

(NOSENKO) became a KGB officer, and later

reverted again to his estimate that "ANDRE;" was recruited in

1949-1950.

Wher he returned to Geneva

ir. 1964, NOSENKO changed

this story and said that during his 1953-1955 tour in the U.s.

Embassy Section he saw cipher specialist SELEZNOV, who had come

so consult on the then-active

"ANDREY" case.

NOSENKO was

unable to explain how he could have been sure in 1962 that the

"ANDREY" case was before his time; when ne said in 1964 that

this was not so.

Dayle SMITH confessed that he was -ecruited by

the KGB in late

1953, and records show that he left Moscow in

early 1954.

c. Circustances of Entry

NOSENKO has consistently related his entrance into the KGB

to discussions he had with General KOBULOV in early 1953 in MCs-

cow, after returnirg from the Baltic.

However, he has changed the

date of these discussions with KOBULOV virtually every time he

has told this story.

In June 1962, NOSENKO said he talked with

KOBULOV at the NOSENKO dacha while on leave in March 1953; during

the April 1964 interrogations he changed the date to February

1953; in April 1965 NOSENKO said he spoke to KOBULOV at the

KOBULOY dacha in January 1953 while on leave and that he lived

at home and was at the

"disposal of GRU personnel" during Febru

ary and March.

Finally, in April 1966, NOSENKO said he first

spoke to KOBULOV at KOBULOV's dacha on

New Years Day 1953, that

he was subsequently "resting" at a sanitorium connected with his

tuberculosis of the year before, and that he spoke

KOBULOV or. the day of STALIN's funeral, while home

few days

from the sanitorium.

It was at this second encounter with KOBULOV

that the latter promised to concern himself with NOSENKO's entry

Into the KGB.

685:

In 1962 NOSENKO described the simple procedure by which he

entered the KGS, volunteering that there was no need to fill out

a questionnaire

(arxeta) as the KGB already had his files fron

the GRU.

In April 1964 when asked if he had not been required

to fill out any questionnaires or other docurents, NOSENKO des-

cribed the anketa and other forns he completed (saying he took

them home to do sol and his various interviews with. KGB per-

sonnel officers.

He was interrogated in detail on these claims

by DERYABIN in 1965,

to whom he gave descriptions, albeit in-

accurate,

of the various forms and of his visits to KGB Personnel.

In 1966

NOSENKO wrote in his autobiography that there were no

talkg with KGB Personnel before or after his acceptance and im

plied that there were no forms to fill out.

d. Remarka

According to all of NOSENKO's stories, his GRU service was

the springboard for his acceptance into the KGB.

while home in Moscow from Primorsk/Sovetsk, he entered the KG3

as a lieutenant since this was his naval tank, his admission

according

to the early version was facilitated by the availability

of his GRU personnel file; yet CIA has concluded that NOSENKO

was never a GRU officer

and it appears highly improbable that he

ever in Primorsk under any circumstances.

On the basis of gererally available information concerning

Soviet realities at the time of NOSENKO's claimed entry into the

YGB, supported by the expert testimony of DERYABIN (who was in

then MVD, in Moscow at the time and h.d been himself a

KGB personnel officer until less than a year earlier), a person

with the background NOSENKO has given could rot be accepted into

the KGB in the marner he claims.

to have precluded this, but in addition, NOSENKO descrited a

series of incidents in his life equally likely to cause rejection.

NOSENKO'g mistakes,

changes of story, and apparent fabrications

add to the unlikelihood of his account.

It is concluded that,

as in the case of NOSENKO'S GRU ser-

vice, either NOSENKO and those who have supported aspects of

his story have seriously distorted his past life, or he did not

enter the KGB.

4. Initial Service in the U.S. Embassy Section

a. Introduction

NOSENKO claims to have served in the U.S. Fribassy Section of

the American Department,

Second Chief Directorate, during the

period.from his entry on duty with the KGB until June 1955.

targets during these two years were at first American correspond-

ents in loscow and later American Army Attaches at the Embassy.

NOSENKO sought to avoid discussion of his own or other KGB

activity during this period and

occasion he has tried to di5-

miss the whole period as

"not Iclevant" and "of no

conseauence."

NOSENKO has repeatedly said that he "found hinself" only after

his

initial service in the U.S. Embassy Section.

(He variously dated

his self-discovery as occurring in 1955, when he transited to

ticipation in and award for the BURGI

when the death of his father forced him to pull hinsci

together.)

Before this, NOSENKO said, he was a tastrel and "did not pay

attention to the work."

b. Work Against Anerican Correspondents

MOSENKO exempted himself from reporting details of KGB work

against any specific American correspondent in Moscow in 1953-

1954 (Pages 93-96) by saying that,

as a new, very junior employee

he had no access to operational files and did not participate

personally in the handling of any of the currespondents.

Although

able to identify four correspondents in Moscow ino were

then re

cruited KGB agents, NOSENKO learned this information either in

conversations with

his superior KOZLOV or at some point and in

some undefined way

after he no longer was working against these

targets.

NOSENKO's early months in the job were spent reading

personality (not operational)

files on a number of the corres

pondents

in Moscow

(none of which indicated the individual's de-

velopmental or agent status) and familiarizing himself with KGB

methods.

Later NOSENKO was assigned the "agent network" of

drivers, clerical personnel,

and domestics surrounding four. of

the correspondents (two of whom were recruited "GS agents at

the time; he met with them periodicaily to determine whether

they had. devaloped any important information.

however,

NOSENKO appears to have beer given very little responsibility:

His superior KOZLOV often went along to the meetings with NOSENKO,

first to

show him how to handle the agents and afterward when-

ever something interesting would begin to develop.

according to NOSENKO, KOZLOV would accompany him to meetings

with these Soviet citizens-agents even when there was a "hint"

that something of interest might develop.

NOSENKO has been able

to identify some of these agents, but for all but a few he re-

called neither their names nor personalia concerning them.

c. Work Against Army Attaches

Regarding

NOSENKO's work against American Army Attaches ne

claimed a specific area of KGB responsibility, one for which

alone was accountable and one about which something was previously

known fron U.S: records. Only 20 months at the longest, it is

TOP SECRET

## Page 87

687.

the last period in which NOSENKO had no supervisory responsibility

to divert his attention fro personal operational duties.

NOSENKO could not resember when he tous over responsibility

for the Army Attaches, and he named two other KGB officers bofore

settling

upon BUDYLDIN

as the person from whon he received the

Attaches' files.

Then belittling his earlier responsibilities

for correspondents, he has said several times that he had been o

that job "only about six monthg."

Assuming that NOSENKO entered

tbe KGB in the middle of March 1953, this would date his transfer

to work

againgt the Attaches in the fall of that year.

In dig=

cussing this transfer itself, however, NOSENKO has congistently

said that it took place in 1954.

Asked when

in 1954, NOSENKO

bas varlously replied "at the beginning of 1954," January 1954,

and 40% 1954.

Under Interrogation in early 1905, NOSENKO rE-

fused to estimate when he took over this responsibility. He has

always said that he turned over these duties and transferred from

tbe U.S. Embassy Section in June 1955, when the Tourist Department

WaS

established within the Scoond Chief Directorate.

NOSENKO has said in different contoxts that as the American

Department case officer responsible for cperations against the

U.S. Arny Attaches he received and was responsible for assimilat-

ing the product of a wide variety of sources on the individuals

who were his targets.

He has mentioned information received from

the KGB First Chief (Foreigo Intelligence) Directorate; the

Archives of the HGB/MVD/KGB; microphones which were en placed

about a year before NOSEYKO entered the

American Departnent; a

network of Soviet chauffeurs, cooks, language instructors, and

other agents in the Eubassy who together provided little uscul

Information; permarent and roving surveillance patrois outside

the Embassy; fixed observation posts next to, across frog and

near the Embassy; advance notification of intent to travel by

itineraries; and reports from outside Mos-

cow, including surveillance, agent networks,

the Militia, and the

military.

The point of collecting and assimilating this infor-

mation, NOSESKO said, was to be able to know what the Attaches

vere doing in Moscow

ard thereby to control their intelligence

collection activities.

Far less important was the goal of re-

cruiting Military Attaches; SOSENKO knew of only several 10-

stances when this was attempted, and all of these efforts failed.

The KGB's priscipal interest in control rather than recruit-

went has been NOSENKO's explanation for knowing little about the

backgrounds ard personal lives of his targets--such information,

he stated, simply was not pertinent to the primary mission of

*On some occasions NOSENKO has said that the microphones in the

Army Attache offices were his most valuable source of informa

tion on his

targets of 1954-1955; at other times he

has said

that he knew nothing of these microphones until he

U.S. Embassy Section in 1960;

and at still other times he clained

to have known only of their existence during 1953-1955 but not

where any were located.

control.*

He has also used this explanation to support his claim

that there were no recruitments of silitary attaches during this

period.

An exception, wherein the koa did careíully compiie a great

deal of vulnerability data on ar. Army Attache, las described by

NOSENKO in connection with the approach to walter MULE (Page 104).

On the basig of these expianations, NOSENKO's knowledge of the

official and unofficial activities of his alleged targets in this

period deserves atrention.

NOSENKO knew almost nothing about the personal backgrounds

and families of the eight members of the Army Attache Office

whom he identified as his targets (Pagus 99-106). Although he was

able to identify each by rant and position in the rabassy-some

times inaccurately--and

3 Eow cases to describe certain of

their operational activities, he was unaware of or had forgotten

such facts as:

- Colonel Earl L. MICKELSON, the Army Attache in 1954

and 1955, was arrested twice ! the Militia outsice of vos-

in 1954.

- Assistant Army Attache Ira RICHARDS was a language

student of GROMOKOVA (identified by NOSENKO as a KGB agent) :

by RICHARDS' account she sought to elicit biographic data

from him during the lessong.

- William STROUD, the assistant Ary Attache, travelled

to Kharkov in May 1955 to interivew an American defector.

(NOSENKO has identified Frank SISCOE, sho accompanied STROUD;

as a suspected CIA officer; he has coopted by CIA.)

NOSENKO, furthermore, was ignorant of important events, known

independently

to CIA, which were within the sphere of what he

claimed was his cirect, personal responsibility:

- NOSENKO claimed direct personal jesponsibility for

the file of and operational activity agains: Lieutenant

Colonel Howard FELCHLIN (Pages 191-103).

He claimed to be

receiving agent infornation on him but could not recall the

names or crjptoryms of

any such agents.

Gie said, Eor

exarple:

"I think FELCHLIN must have had a maid, and she

would have been a KGB agent.")

NOSE:KO described FELCHLIN

as by far the most aggressive of his targets and hence the

object of special interest: yet he did not know or remember

NOSENKO himself, when giving the reason why he did not know

more details about the U.S. Embassy Section's targets while

he was its Deputy Chief in 1960-1961, said that as a supervisor

he was too busy oversceing subordinates; hence,. NOSENKO con-

tinued, he could not be expected to remember as many such de-

tails as would be possible had he been a case officer working

daily with only four or five files.

explained why he was unable to supply the details of planning

and organizing operations

against tourists in the period 1955-

1959; he contrasted operations

anything about FELCHLIN'a background, presurably well docu-

mented by the

KGB becauge FELCHIli had been to the USSR in

two different capacities, merchant seaman and diplomatic

cOUrier, prior to arriving in Moscow as the Assistant Army

Attache: also FELCHLIN had had prior official association

with. GRU officers in Austria, Gemany, and the United States,

and he continued to be ir. liaison with one of them in Moscor.

NOSEYKO could recall nothing about FELCHLIN'e intelligence

activities in

the USSR or his trips about the country, or

what had been done about them by the KGB. In speaking of

FELCHLIN's expulsion from the Soviet Union, NOSENKO reforted

the KGB file noted that FELCHLIN had been caught taking

photographs on

some occasion, but he did not know that fEr

CHLIN in June 1954 was arrested in Kiev with another Assist-

ant Army Attache, F.J. YENGER.

(Erroneously identificd by

NOSENKO as an Air Force Attache, YEAGER likewise should have

been NOSENKO's target. NOSENtO also did not know that

FELCHLIN, with another Aimy Attacne and iwo Air. Force Attaches,

in September 1953 had rade an urprecedented train trip through-

out Siberia and that six months later, at the end of March

1954, had been the subject of a rewspaper article which

charged that they had lost

NOSENKO was unable to provide a date

for FELCHLIN's expul-

sion from the soviet Unior., and he inew nothing of the un-

NOSENKO said that he could not be expected to

now the details because this incident occurred after he

transferred from the U.S. Embassy Section to the Tourist

Department in June 1955.

NOSENKO was then told the recorded

date

of the expulsion, 3 July 1954, and he Irplied that this

was not true.

- Discrepancies appeared in NOSENKO's account of one

of the best known incidents in the history of KGB operations

against the American officials in the Soviet Union, the

subject of reports by GOLITSYN and other CIA sources and the

subject of training caterials. This was the seizure of

sensitive technical coilection equipment on 5 May 1955 in

Stalingrad from three Assistant Military Attaches from the

U.S. Embassy--Major John S. BENSON, Captain STROUD, and

Captain MULE--and their expulsion

days later.

NOSENKO claimed direct responsibility for KGB

work against these officers (Pages 103-105): he described

an earlier attempt to defect MULE, his own plans for seizing

this equipment at a railroad station outside Moscow, and his

role in developing plans for the successful operation in

Stalingrad.

- NOSENKO identified George VAN LAËTHEY as an Assistant

Air Attache in 1953 or 1954: he was a target of another U.S.

Embassy Section officer, and an unsuccessful KGB development

operation was carried out against him.

NOSENKO did not krow

chat VAN LASTHEy was actually

an Assistant Army Attache, who

left Moscow in March 1953 and was succeeded by NOSENKO'S OW

target halter MULE (ste above).

What NCSENKO additionally

did not know is that In Moscow VAN LAETHEy was the Attache

cryptographic security officer, the supersor of Dayle SMITH

(the subject of NOSE:KO'& "ANDREY" lead--see below) and a

friend of the motor pool sergeant Roy RHODES,

a KGB agent.

NOSENKO furthermore did not know that on 19 March 1955,

again as an Army Attache, and only two years after being

transferred from Moscow,

VAN LAETHEM was again sent to Mos-

con, ostensibly on a PCS assignment but actually on tempor-

ary duty.

Moscow involved the planned use of the electronic equipment.

which was seized in Stalingrad while VAN LAETHEM was still

in Moscow.)

d. Additional Reporting

His information on two other operatiors involving Anericans

was said by NOSENKO to stem from his 1953-1955 service in the U.S.

Embassy Section

One was the recruitment of the military cipher

machine mechanie having the KGB cryptonym

"ANDREY" (Dayle SMITH,

see Pages 413-426

and further comments in Part VIII.B. 3. and

VIII.C.).

NOSENKO in 1962 was sure not only that this

recruit-

ment

took place before he joined the KGB but that "ANDREY" had

left the USSR by then as well: he repeatedly estimated "ANDREY'S"

recruitrent date as "1949-1950. At all times he has claimed

certainty that

"ANDREY" was the last KGB recruitment in the

Embassy until the time of NOSENKO's defection in January 1964•

In 1964, however, NOSE:KO changed his

story and said "ANDREY"

was active while NOSENKO was in the U.s. Embassy Section ii. 1954-

1955.

with KGB officers.

e. Remarks

NOSENKO's accounts of the 1953-1955 period are confused,

contradictory.

and, when compared with collateral information,

incomplete and inaccurate.

He has been inconsistent in dating

his shift of responsibilities withir. the U.S. Embassy Section,

in dating his departure from the Section (vsz., the timing of

the Stalingrad incident and the approach to SMITil), and in dating

his first knowledge of the microphones in the embassy.

new

detaile of inportance on the American correspondents,

NOSENKO has proven unreliable regarding his work against Army

Attaches:

He misidentified two (YEAGER and VAl LAETHEM), he

clained to have almost no information on the backgroundo and acti

vities of the otheres and he lacked even the most important de

talls on security affairs involving the majority of his eight

alleged targets.

In addition, NOSENKO has told CIA almost noth

Ing about the work of his colleagues in the U.S. Embassy Section.

The atatements by NOSENKO about this period therefore hold

so dittle substance

and the manner of his reporting was so

vincing, that his claim to have been an officer of the U.s.

Section in the years 1953-1955 cannot be true.

in June 1958 to the position of Deputy Chief of the Merican-

Canadian-British Tourist Section, hereafter referred to as the

Arcrican Tourist Section.

The oniy case of the june 1955-Jure 1958 period resulting

in agent contacts abroad, and the one to which NCSENKO ascribed

the greatest importance, was the recruitment if BUrGI. For this

reason, the BURGI operation is discussed in detail below, with

particular attention being given to those aspects of the case

which reflect upon NOSENiO's own personal role.

(ii) The BURGI Case

NOSENKO's statements of this operation generally agreed with

that BURGI proviced to the Fal in 1957.

The part NOSENKO played

in the case.

both in his bries initial presence with the two

homosexuals in the Moscow restaurant on the evening of BURG's

compromise (20 Jure 1956) and in the riev events (23-28 June 1956)

would appear to be one normally tarra by a KGB staff officer.

The identities of the other to KGs participants in the Kiev

recruitment, KOZLOV and PETRENKO, seem clearly

established.

There

were discrepancies between NOSINKO's and BURGi's versions, but

most of these could stem from NOSINKO's faulty norory nine years

after the events.

(Such discrepancies include "OSaNKO's ¿ailure

to remember his first Moscow meetings with BURGI: the identity,

role, or even existence of the person "Anatoliy" whom BURGI says

introduced him to HOSENKO and participated in the homosexual

compromise; whether NCSENKO was at the Kiev airport to meet BURGI;

the location of NOSENKO's bedroom in

the Kiev Hotel as

compared

tO BURGI'S; NOSENKO'& reference to BURGI'g "interpreter" when in

fact BURGI neither had nor needed one: and NOSENKO's failure to

remember the unusual circunstances of BURGIg departure from

Kiev.)

Other contradictions and omissiong in NOSENKO'& reporting

relate to matters of greater operational consequence:

• NOSENKO was unable to say when or how the KGS first

learned that BURGI, tas a homosexual, nor could he remember

who flat proposed an operation against him.

- NOSENKO gave a confused and evasive account of his

dealings with the Pirst Chief Directorate on this case.

- ROSENKO insisted that there was no official file on

BURGI, and that none was opened as a result of this opera-

tione

The initiative for the operation came, he said, from

the Second Chief Directorate, and when NOSENKO traced

BURGI

in the First Chief Directorate, there was no information on

him there.*

The KGB's only information on

BURGI at the

time of the compromise came from BURGI's visa application

(which showed him to be a professor of Russian)

and a few

agent reports from the preceding days in Moscow:

on the other hand, reported that during the recruiturnt:

KOZLOV, the

senior soviet present, shoned knowledge of the

names of BURGI's sister, nother and father and knew the

sister's occupation; details of BURGI's background, work, and

military service, BURG!'s relations with the Russicum in

Rome, which BURGI

said he had never mentioned in the USSR:

and BURGI's acquaintance in the U.S. with Alexander KERENSKY.

one of the main reasons for his rapid rise in the kGB.

NOSENKO has named wich clarity and consistency the other

officers of the American Tourist Section during this period.

The

Soviet agents of his section whom NOSENKO has identified were

mostly his own; he said that the agents were corstantly shifted

from case officer to case officer and hence it was "difficult to

say just who handled which agents."

NOSENKO said he had approxi

mately eight soviet agents in 1958 ard about 12 or 14 in 1959,-

most of them employed by inturist (Pages 109-112) •

Knculedge of Section's Activities

As of Jure 1958,

according to NGSENKO, the work of the

section of which he was deputy chief was

"just getting going."

Its mission was, first of ail, to detect western Intelligence

officers and agents anong the

increasing flow of tourists visit

ing the Soviet

Union; only secondarily was the section directed

toward the recruitment of

agents from among these tourists.

In his new position NOSENKO was responsible for supervising

other officers in the section in efforts along these lires.

cause of this and because at GRIBANOV's request he personally

reviewed KGB information on the use of tourist cover by western

services and KGB counteraction through 1958 (Pages

• 145-146), NOSENKO made

statements concerning these

subjects during the 1955-1959 period.

over, thanks to collateral holdings, what NOSENKO did and did not

know can be compared with information from other sources. These

facts are reviewed below.

(1) BLAKE

A valuable source of information for the KGB in its planning

for the operational activity of its Tourist Department in the

late 1950'g and early 1960's was the Englishman, George BLAKE

(Pages 146-147) •

BLÄKE has confessed that in the sumer of 1959

he passed the KGB a 19-page summary of the results of a three-day

meeting during the first week of June 1959, between representa

tives of CIA and MI-6;

not appear to be aware of who BLAke was, much less of his lm-

portance to the KGE.

NOSENKO never volunteered the name of

BLAKE in his debriefings,

when specifically asked in

about BLAKE, the KGB agent in British Intelligence, he said

that he had read the dossier and that BLAKE had been "an agent

which was held

in the Tourist Department at the time the latter report was

received by the KG3,

sald that he reviered all important ma-

terials of the American Tourist Section

when he became its Chief

in January 1962.

Asked whether the Tourist Departrent had re-

ceived documentary information from any agent source while

NOSENKO was away

fron the department in the years 1960-1961.

he replied that none had and that he knew of no agent who could

have provided such documentary irformation.

(i1) GOLITSYN Document

NOSENKO in 1964 reported knowing that GOLITSYN at the cine

of his defection in December 1961 took with him an official

top secret KGB documert

He

did not mention this fact in the Jure 1962 meetings.

NOSENKO also stated that this document had been prepared by

the Tourist Department, he has not been able to describe che

document in detail and specifically did not mention that this

particular document was in large part based, as subsequent

analysis has shown, upon the above-mentioned reports submitted

According to NOSE:RO's account of his direct involvement

in the case of Lee Karvey OSWALD (Pages 136-114), his partici-

pation seemed to sten solely from his supervisory role as

Deputy Chief of the Arerican Section.

In this capacity, NOSENRO

said, he was the one wno made the decision that OSWALD was

"not normal" and of no interest to the KGB.

On other occasions

NOSENKO has reported that he made this cecision together with

his subordinate KRUPNOV, or that "they decided," or

"it was

decided.*

NOSENKO's information or the handling of OSWALD in

1959 is unique, and there is no collateral information against

which it can be reliably measured.

The reguits of the poly-

examination in October 1966, hcwever, indicated that

Likewise, NOSENKO was unable

(iv) The Agent PRIPPEL

FRIPPEL (Pages 129-135) is the only American citizen with

Whom NOSENHO ever had more than fleeting operational contac

in his whole KGB career and is the only foreign agent he claims

to have run for more

than two meetings at any

time in his car-

eer (with the exception of at, Pages 201-212, and "PROXHOR,"

Pages 173-181) •

The Anerican ExpIesE Company representative

in Moscow, FRIPPEL has not recruited so that he could report

on American tourists visiting the Soviet Union, or on official

and unofficial Americans living there, but in hopes of learn

ing about approaches being made to members of Soviet delegationg

visiting the United States.

With a weaith of reporting assets

in Moscow, NOSENKO said, the KGB did not need him there.

When

FRIPPEL was reassigned to New York City, however, there

were

no plans to contact hin through the local KGB Legal Residency.

FRIPPEL is identified by KGB cryptonym in the CHEREPANOV pagers

as a suspected American Intelligence agent.

That FRIPPEL was

considered

such by the KGS is confirmed by statements of a self-

admitted KGB agent in contact with the Anerican tourist ROBERTS

in 1962.

NOSENTO said PRIPPEL was his agent and said, repeatedly:

"I recruited him.myself."

In 1962 no other KGB officer was

mentioned by NOSENKO, who quoted from a number of his conver

sations with FRIPPEL.

In 1964 NOSENKO said he and CHELNOKOV

"had carried

out the recruitment together," but NOSENKO was the

case officer.

According to PRIPPEL'& account, CHELNCKOV 5a8

when PRIPPEL returned to the USSR, and these consisted o a briet

visit to FRIPPEL's hotel room during FRIPZEL'& Visit to Mosco

In the sumer of 1962 and a short meeting in Odessa where FRIP

PEs was on a cruise in February 1963.

(Both of these meetings

took place

after NOSENKO, in his 1962 contacts with CIA, had

exposed FRIPPEL as a XGB

agent.)

According to FRIPPEL,

February 1963 meeting. NOSENKO phoned someone to ask whetter.

he could accept FRIPPEl's invitation to board the ship; tre

answer was evidently no.

NOSENKO denied this, insisting that

there was no one in Odessa superior to nim, and as a Deputy ve

partnent Chief, he would not have to ask anyone anyway.

NOSENKO, CHELNUKOV, and their wives dined at FRIPPEL'S

house in Moscow some time after FRIPPEL's recruitment.

NOS ENKO

acknowledaed this to have been a most unusual procedure ard

could name no parallel in KGB agent handling.

Asked why it

happened,

"Because he invited me,"

and when asted

why CHELNOKOV ard his wife went alung, NOSENKO said: "Because

he was also involved in the recruitment."

NOSENKO said he retained operational control of FRIPPEL,

then still Moscow representative of a tourist firm, when NOSENKO

shifted in June 1960 from the Tourist Departrent to the Areri

PCS departure from Moscow in January 1961 and after his own re-

turn to the Tourist Department. According to FRIPPEL, who saw

no sign of change in NOSENKO's reponsibilities during his rela-

tionship with hin, he recalled neeting CHELNOKOV (who had

stayed in the Tourist Department) alone, without NOSENKO, prOb

ably in 1960.

in fact, they met socially several times.

NOSENKO could re-

call nothing which FRIPPEL ever reported to or did for the KGB,

dismissing

the aubject on several occasions with:

"He never

gave anything of value."

The only question NOSENKO posed

when he care to FRIPPEL in August 1952, FRIPPEL said, was

whether the agent krew "what the newspaper editors he was es-

corting were going to ask KHRUSYCHEV in an interview. Accord-

as an operation of greatest importance to the American Tour

has admitted lying about his having received an award for

his role in the recruitwent of BURgI.

From January 1960 until January 1902 NOSENt claims

to have been

Deputy Chief of the U.S. Erbassy Section of

the American Department,

under KOVSHUK.

This period (described in Pages 152-285)

is the nost significant in NOSENKO's account of his KGB

careor for a nunder of reasons:

- The section is the specific unit working against

the b.s. Erbassy, by dosalid's own staterents the KGB's

most important courterintelligence targe:

b. Entry into the Section

NOSENKO haR given a detailed account of how he cane to

be transferred into the U.S. Embassy Section, but he hag

never given & precise date, usually saying "January 1960"

"at the beginning of 1960."

As described on Pages 153-154, the shift was made at

GRIBAYOY'g Insistence and against NOSL"KO's own persona.

GRIBANOY told NOSENKO during a personal interview,

at which HOSENKO voiced his objections, that the transfer

was part of Als (GRIBANOV's) plans and

was pricarily to put

new iite into operations agalost American code clerks, the

primary target of the Second Chief Directorate.

did not tell

him why he, instead of another, had been

sclected for this job, although NOSENKO had the impression

it was because of his

achievements in the Tourist Depart-

ment. (see Part VIII.D.5.).

NOSENKO's transfer could not

have been a result of his close personal relationship with

GRIRANOV or because his father was a friend of GRIBANOV'S:

NOSENKO has admitted that he exaggerated the closeness of

his relationship with the Chief of the Second Chief Directo-

rate and nost recently (February 1965) said that he had few

personal contacts with him outside of work; NOSENKO has also

said that his father never met GRIBANOV.

NOSENKO Initially said that he relieved nobody on

coming into the scction.

He eventually recalled, however,

that BAKHVALOV was his predecessor but left the scction

before he (NOSENKO) arrived.

NOSENKO's confusion on this

point, his description of how he assumed custody of certain

from BAKHVAIUV although the latter had transferred to

another department, and the opportunities NOSENiO had to

name BAKHVALOV as his predecessor before he eventually did

so are described on Pages 154156.

c. Functions as Deputy Chief

In NOSENKO's view the transfer to become Deputy Chief

of the section from the same position in another section

was definitely an important promotion:

He now became

second-in-charge of the most important operational section

of the entire Sccond Chief Directorate. As KOVSHUK's

deputy, NOSENKO had the right and obligation to be aware of

all activities in order to exercise his general supervisory

functions and so as to be prepared to become the Acting

Chief of the section when necessary.

NOSEAKO said that consequently nothing was hidden from

him for the two years 1960 and 1961. He claimed to have

had complete knowledge of the U.S. Embassy Section e activi-

ties during the relatively recent years of 1960 ard 1961

and to know of all significaut operational successes achieved

in the years before and after this period.

was able to say in 1965:

"Tell Sr. BcCone

that there were no recruitments. I was there."

When NOSENKO reported for duty, he and KOVSHlK agreed

on a division of supervisory duties within the section.

KOVSHUK was, in addition to his over-all responsibility for

the section's operations, to supervise in particular opera-

tional activity against American diplomatic personnel assigned

to the U.S. Fmbassy.

NOSENKO had been specifically instructed

by GRIBANOV and American Department Chief KLYPIK to concentrate

the supervision of operations against the

most importabt American recruitment target, the code clerks

at the Enbassy, with the aim of revitalizing these actl

vities and making recruitments.

(NOSENKO said there had

none since

the early 1950's.)

According to the agreed

upon division of labor, NOSENKO also assumed cese officer

Additionally, he was responsible for maintaining

the section's file on factors pertaining to the physical

security of the Embassy and for receiving and disseminating

materials fron the microphones concealed in varlous U.S.

Embassy offices.

These were functions held, JOSENKO said,

by his predecessor BAKHVALOY and were turned over by NOSEYKO

at the end of 1961 to his successor GRYAZNOV: Apart from

these duties, which apparently were routinely assumed by

the Deputy Chief, NOSENKO supervised, during the early part

of 1960 (ag NOSENKO first said in 1965), the work of the

officera responsiblo for operations agalnat: the Amorican

ArMed FUsCON Allachos In MusCow; lu Uctober 1966, YOSENKO

reported that he was personally responsible during this

period for the operatioal activity against aval and Marine

officers in the Naval Attache's office.

d. Knowledgcability as Deputy and Acting Chief

As deputy to KOVSHUK, NOSENKO said, he was aware of

all the operations being conducted by the section during

this two-year period; by his own

statenent,

nothing was

kept from him.

There were in these two years a total of

over three pontlis when KOVSHUK was ill or on leave, and at

these times NOSENKO was acting chief of the section.

the latter capacity, NOSENKO was responsible for supervising

the administrative work and operational activity of the en-

tire section and,

in particular, assumed KOVSHUK's work in

directing operations against diplomatic personnel assigned to

the U.S.

in Moscow.

Therefore, périnent to his

claims are the facts presented in the following paragraphs.

that he made as acting chief, or any specific or unusual

occurrences during these times.

In answer to a question,

NOSENKO said that the only specific responsibility of KOVSHUK'S

which he handled in the Chief's absence was reporting to the

Chief of the First Department about all correspondence going

out of the U.S. Embassy Section.

NOSENKO did not meet any of KOVSHUK's agents during his

absences.

He could not remember any of KOVSHUK's agents.

NOSENKO said that he carefully directed the work of GRYAZiOV

• and KOSOLAPOV during these two years, discussing their cases

with them, taking part in operational planning,

and approvirg

or disapproving all operational measures. NOSENKO originally

asserted that he had also read and studied all the files

kept on the derican code clerks; under questioning on indivi-

dual cases, however, he retracted these statuents and said

that ho ray tave skimmed some of the files,

that he did not

study any of then, but that in any event he read all the

current inconirg materials on the code clerks from nicrophones,

and the like and then routed them to the case officer

concerned.

CIA has two types of information against which the re-

ports from NOSENKO can be compared.

The first consists of

the detalled debriefings of code clerks returning frcm

Moscow, addinistered routinely by the Department of State

and the military services; it also includes the special de-

briefings and interrogations of the Department of State,

the FBI, and CIA as a follow-up

to KGB opcrational activity

from various sources.

accumulated a considerable amount of collateral

infornation on the activities

of the U.S. Erbassy section

involving United States code clerks during the period NOSEN

The second type of infor

from contacts with U.S. Embassy Section officers in Moscow

and Helyinki, was able

to provide several leads to what he

Information on a number of other cases,

his opinion, is described in the tabulation of American

case leads giver on

Pages 364-410.

Certain of these cases

examined below to determine whether NOSEYKO'g

knowledge equates with details which the deputy and acting

chief of the U.S. Embassy Section could reasonably be

expected to know and retain.

(1) The STORSBERG Case

The operation against STORSBERG (Pages 166-185) was,

the nust important case he had as supervisor

of code clork operations.

The KGB, while able to break

certain State

Department ciphers, had had

no success with

military cryptographic systems:

and therefore NOSENKO

"dropped everything for a year" to involve himself with the

development of James STORSBERG, the military code clerk at

The following facts are pertinent to an

evaluation of YOSENKO's story of this case.

NOSENKO originally raised the STORSBERG case indirectly

at his first meeting with CIA on 9 June 1962.

He

told how

GOLITSYN, during a visit to the American Department in 1960,

at a time NOSENKO was on leave, had requested permission

to use a U.S. Enbassy Section agent, a Finn. in his orn opera-

in Helsinki.

During his discussions

in the American

Department, GOLITSYN learned that this Finnish agent was

being used

in operations against Embassy employees living in

America House.

NOSENKO said that the KGB realized that

GOLITSIN had passed

this information on to the Americans

following his

defection, for the regulations goverring

visits to America

House by third

nationals had been tightened.

At this necting NOSENKO did not name the Finnish

agent or

his involvement in any particular operational acti

vity nor did he date the visit by GOLIlSYN.

Later in the 1962 meetings NOSENKO gave a detailed

summary of the Finnish agent's involvement in the unsuccess-

ful recruitment attempt against an Amcricar military code

NOSENKO, without naming the Finn or the American,

said that he personally conducted the recruitment confron

tation with GRIBANOV present.

These early accounts mere full

of quotes of that NOSENKO said to the American and vice

versa, descriptions of the American's reaction to the confron-

tation, and statements of NOSENKO's admiration

for the Ameri

can despite his refusal to work.

Following his defection,

NOSENKO recounted the case in even greater detail, in fact,

in more detail than he gave for any other case.

fied the Finn as PREISFREUND and the American as STORSBERG

and described and referred to the case whenever possible

(over 50 times).

When asked for details of other code clerk

for example, he repeatedly diverted to discussion of

the STORSBERG case

to illustrate how the KCB operated against

code clerks in general.

After defecting NOSENKO denied that he personally con-

fronted STORSBERG.

He said that his personal

role was linited

to directing STORSBERG into the hotel room where the approach

was made; after first saying that he had never

clained any

other role, he admitted that he may have been "painting"

statesents had been played to him and he had successively

said that (a) it was not bis voice,

(b) he was druik in

1962, (c) the CIA case officer in Genera had made him

nervous, and (d) CIA probably spliced various pieces of

tape together to make this false one. Still, NOSENKO

said, he directed the entire operation from beginning to end,

and it was his most important case.

Interrogated further

concerning his role in the STORSBERG operation in October

JOSEYKO said that he had never read the KGB file on

STORSBERG, which was held by GRYAZNOV.

GOLITSYN, as NOSENKO reported, didvisit the American

Department, did request permission

to use PREISFREUND opera

tionally in Helsinki, and did report this to CIA in late

his defection.

GOLITSY also reported that,

in denying his request, KOVSHUK told him that PREISFREUND

had recently been used in the successful recruitment of an.

American Embassy employce, possibly a military man and pos

sibly a code clerk or diplomat; therefore, KOVSHLK said,

PREISFREUND could rot be used for six months or so in other

optrations, for otherwise the Americans might becone suspi

NOSENKO has not reported these details, but has

only that GOLITSIN ras instructed to drop interest in PREIS-

FREIND because PREISFREUND belonged to the American Department

of the Second Chief Directorate.

NOSENKO volunteered at his first meeting with CIA that

he was on leave outside of Moscow on the uccasion of COLITSY''g

visit to the American Department.

Since defrcting he has

insisted with

absolute certainty that this visti took place

in the late spring or carly summer of 1961 and has described

his leave, where

he went and with whom. GOLlTSIT's passport

and CIA travel

data show that GOLITSIN was on TDY in Moscow

in anuary 1961.*

Told this, NOSESKO said that it is untrue,

that he recalled being told of COLITSIN's visit after his

return fron leavo in July 1961, and that he was certain that

ke (SOSENKO) was in Moscow in January 1961.

JOSENKO has indirectly confirmed that the oppration of

which GOLITSYN learned during this visit to the Ancrican

Department was the operation against STORSBEG. He did so by

bis assertion that PREISFREUND, his own agent, was used in

operation, that against STORSBERG.

Thus, as to the

outcome of this operation, there is a conflict between NOSEN-

KO's information and that earlier provided by COLITSYN.

There is also a conflict between NOSENKO's statements that

the recruitment approach took place some time after day 1961

(NOSINKO's dates have varied from

June to October 1961,

STORSBERG. said it was in October 1961) and GOLITSIN's state

ment that this approach had already been made in January 1961

he learned of it.

COLITSIN provided a second lead which YOSENKO appears

to confirm and which may be related to the STORSBERG case.

as STORSBEPG) asserted that the STORSBFEG

opration was just under way at this time and was long and

drawn-out.

Apart from the STORSBERG operation, NOSENKO has been

able to supply the greatest amount of detail concerning the

operation

pouch clerk Paul JENNER

This case developed

as a result of an idea originated by NOSESKO himself shortly

the inaccessibility of American code clerks to the RGB in

Moscow, it was JOSENKO's plan to send a KGB officer to liel-

Siaki In order to strike up an acquaintance with & code

clork entering the Soviet Union aboard the Helsinki-loscow

The first (ard last) time this was attempted, NO-

SFIXO related, was in March 1960, when the KCB learned that

JENNER, listed as a "secretary-archivist" and thus assumed

KGB to be a code clerk,

was scheduled to transit

Hulsinki en routr. to his assigngent at the l.S. Embassy in

Under NOSENKOs supervision KOSOLAPON therefore

travr lled to Helsinki and boarded the same train as JENNER!'

Additionally, GRYNINOV took a KGB female agert to the town,

of Tyborg, on the Finno-Soviet border, and placed her on the

Botin KOSOLAPOV and the female agent met and

spoke with JENNER

en route to loscow,

and the girl gave him

her telephone number, asking hi

After JENNER's

arrival in Moscow,

both KOSOLAPOV and GRYAZNOV submitted

written reports to JOSENKO describing the contacts on the

train.

Although the KGB later found out that JENYER was only

& pouch clerk; not a cryptographer, he was considered of

interest and when JENNER failed to telephone the female

the two wore brought together in a "chance meeting"

at the Moscow airport.

JaNER would have no part of the

agent's invitations, however, and the operation therefore

went no further.

*When NOSENKO was told of the GOLITSYN visit in lay or June

1960, he denled that it took place, saying that he reces-

sarily would know if it had.

JENTER reported in the Security Officer at the U.S.

Embassy upon his arri:al that he had been contacted by two

Soviet studeuts from Vyborg, a young mai! and a sonar, on

the Holgink1-10sc0n era10.

He also reported having boen

given a tolephone nuther by the girl and later reported

having been recontacted by her at the Moscow airport.

NOSENKO identified KOLOSOV's photograph as that

of his subordinate KOSOLAPO!®

(NOSENKO earlier said that

he did not know whether KOSOLAPOV used an alias for this

trip, what that alias might have been, or whether KOSOLAPOV

an alias passport; he agreed that

he would have had to

authorize such a passport.)

When he was told _

that KOSOLAPOV did not travel on the same train as JENNER

and therefore could not have met and talked with him as

SOSENKO had reorted, JOSENKO refused to believe it: he in-

sistnd that he had read the reports of both KOSUL IPOV and

GRYAZNOY, and that the events were exactly is he described

them.

(111) The GARLAID Case

116:

GOLITSYN told CIA after his defection that while he was

stationed in Helsinki, probably in November--not March --1960,

KOSOLAPOV travelled to Finland under alias and commercial

cover in order to make the acquaintance of an American code

clerk on the l'elsinki loscow train.

KOSOLAPOV's arrival had

beca announced by a cable from KGR Headquarters to the

Helsinki Legal Residercy.

According to

GOLITST:, the Legal

Residency learned which train this American was to board and

succecded in placing NOSOLAPOV in the same compartment with

GOLITSYN saw KOSOLAPOV board the train with this Ameri

Later, when another American Department officer visited

Helsirki, GOLITSYN asked him how KOSOLAFOV's operation with

the code clerk had gone;

fron the officer's refusal to answer,

assumed that it had been a success.

KOSOLAPUV made a second

KOSOLAPOV left

Helsinki by train on 16 Novenber 1960 and that one

travelling companions on this train was GARLAND, who was

en route to Moscow to assume his duties as chief of the

State Department code room at the American Embassy (Page

198). There were no other Americans on this train.

Told that KOSOLAPOV had made a trip to llelsinki in

November 1960 and had travelled to Moscow on the same train

of KOSOLAPOV's trip to meet JENNER, he rould necessarily

have been involved in the planning of such a second trip

and would have had to approve arrangements and correspondence

in connection with it.

Even if such a trip took place when

NOSENKO was out of Moscow, he sald, the details of it would

that KOSOLAPOV arrived in Helsinki on 12 soycaber 1960 and

that JOSENKO left Moscow for Ansterdam, en route to Cuba,

on 15 Yovember.) NOSENKO has not changed his position that

there was no such trip.

(1v) The MORO'E Caso

• Like the STORSBERG operation, the MORONE Case was men

tioned at NOSENKO's first meeting with CIA; he cited 1t ag

an example of a technique which JOSENKO Introduced for using

third nationals to obtain access to American code cleri:s who

were reluctant to establish contacts with Soviet citizens.

Accordirg to JOSENKO's most recent version, given in early

1965, the KGB learned that MORONE and a Marine Guard (BEGGS)

planned to travel to Marsaw on leave.

KOSOLAPOV thereupon

drew up an operational plan, edited by NOSEKO and KOISHUY

and approved by GRIBANOV, proposing that a ferale agent of

the Polish UB be introduced

to MOROSE on the voscow to War-

saw train for the purpose of obtaining comprorising materials.

KOSOLAPOV arranged with Polish liaison officials in Moscow

to have such an agent sent to Muscow, met her when she

arrived, and briefed her

on the operation.

She was then

placed

on MORONE's train together with & KGB techniciar

whose task it was to obtain tape recordings of the compro

nise.

Events went according to plan:

MOROSE. ct the girl

and

was intinate with her on the train, but when the tech

niciar reported to NOSENKO the day after the train

arrived

in Warsaw, he said

that the tape recordings were of low

quality and unsuitable for their intended purpose.

In a

further attempt to acquire conproaking naterial on MOROSE,

KOSOLAPOV later brought the UB agent

to Moscow, and on this

occasion photographs were obtained of thoir intimacies in

a Moscow

hotel

rOOm.

Still, the KGB felt, there was not

enough blackmail material to ensure recruitment, and it was

further planned to have the America House maid IVANOVA

attempt to lure MORONE to a room in Moscow were truly

comprodising photographs of intimacies with a Soviet citi

zen could be obtained.

Possibly because they noticed MORONE'S

interest in IVAYOVA,

NOSENKO said, the Americans ordered

NORONE out of Moscow before further steps could be taken.

Although NOSENKO provided a considerable amount of

detail on MORONE's trip to Warsaw,

there were numerous

variationg In his different accounts.

In 1962 he said

that he had handled the entire operation himself, including

telephoning Warsaw with the request for the girl; be also

said that the UB obtained compromising photographs in Warsaw

and that several months late: the female agent was brought

to Moscow expressly

for the purpose of introducing MOROSE to

• Suviet girlfriend.

This, NOSENKO said, was successful and

MORONE was soon having intercourse with a KGB agent.

still in place in Geneva on 1 February 1964 NOSEN KO gave a

different version:

"He," he said,

arranged for the girl by

a dispatch pouched to the KGB advisor in Warsaw; moreover,

the Poles,

who had obtained compromising photographs in Var

Saw, sent

the KGB only pictures of the two kissing, keeping

the best ones for themselves, and this is why she

had to be

brought to Moscow.

NOSENKO told the FBI later in February

1964 that compromising photographs had been obtained in Var-

saw but no recruitment was attempted because KHRUSHCHEV had

When in February 1965 it was pointed out that MORONE

arrived in Warsad on 14 December 1960 and that NOSENKO left

for Cuba on 15 Nevember 1960, NOSENKO revised his story of

receiving

the peisonal report of the technician to say that

he had perhaps read the technician's report after returning

from Cuba in december

1960.

NOSEIXO also mentioned IVANOVA, a Maid

face-tu-lace encounter he could recall; and,

on another,

that it was possible that SIURSEFRG--the onl; other possibility-

KEYSERS therefore is the only independent

American source sho could confirm that SOSE KO was involved

in operations against Ascrican Enbassy porsonnel in 1960 or

NOSESKO hinself pollited out, horever, that this cor

was of very short duration, and that it was possible

that KEYSERS would not recognize him.

This was the case:

KEYSERS falled to identiiy NOSENKO's photograph and described

the officer no approached hi as a san considerably older,

and probably of a much heavier build than NOSENKO

Although YOSESKO was able to provide a description of

this incident, he did not know much about the overall KGB

case against KEYSERS and a number of discrepancies have been

In 1962 NOSESKO first reported the approach to KEYSERS,

NOSENKO did not know correctly where or how the KGB

approach which NOSENKO claimed to have made.

(vi). Other Code Clerk Cases

Frark DAY: NOSESKO identified DAY as a State Departent

clerk and the target of either KOSCLAPOV or GRYAZNOV.

As with all other code clerks, NOSENKO was asked whether he

knew of any interesting infornation about DAY, whether be

knew of aDy of DAY's friends in Moscow, or of his travels

inside and outside the

Soviet Union, etc.

NCSENKO answered

"no" to all these questions.

He said that the KGB had no

derogatory information on

DAY, was unarare of any vulner-

abilities he night have had, and that no operational mes

sures were taken against him.

placed in their train compartment.

John TAYLOR: JOSENKO Said TAYLOR was a State Department

code clerk ard the target of KOSOLAPOY.

NOSENKO did not

know of TAILOR's previous service abroad or of any back-

ground information the KGB might have had about hin.

He

an operation against TAYLOR nich centered around

big intinacy with a Russian maid (a KGB agent) and his sy

pathy towards the Soviet Union and its people.

No compro

mising photographs were obtained of TAYLOR and the maid,

however, and no approach was made to hin, possibly because

the KGB did not want to jeopardize the more important STORS-

"flap." According to TAYLOR, he was

intimate with his maid from about September 1960 until the

beginning of 1961.

On one occasion they were intimate 1o &

Á• Reporting or ABIDIA!'s Visit to the Pushkin Street Dead

Drop

NOSESKO's account of the visit by ABIDIAY to the

PENKOVSKIY dead drop site un Pushkin Street in Nosoch 1s

described in detail on Pages 231-235.

In summary, SCSENKO

reported that at the end of 1960 or early 1961 KGB surveil

lance followed ABIDIAY from the U.S. Embassy to Pushkin

Street, where AbIDIAY was noted to enter a residential building.

Upor examination it was decided that this was a likely

dead drop

site, and a stationary surveillance post was 85-

signed to watch it.

After three months, since nothing sug

picious had been noted, this post was renoved.

The true

significance of the location did not become known to the

KGB until after the arrest of PENXOVSKIY in 1962.

case officer when this event took place.

J. Responsibility öf Supervising Military Attache Operationg

On 29 January 1965 NOSEXO told his interrogator that

for the f1rst five or six montha of 1960, Immediatoly after

transferriog to the U.S. Embassy Section and as part of hig

responsibilitles as itg Deputy Chio!, he supervised Second

Chie! Directorate activities against

American service at-

taches in Moscow.

Ey this he meant, NOSE:KO said,

that when

GAVRILENKO (the case officer for Air Force Attaches),

KURILENKO (Army Attaches), or BELOGUAZOV (Naval Attaches and

Marines) had any questions or reports to submit, they would

After about six months he was relieved of this duty because

his other dutieg did not allow gufficient time for this

function and because it was considered more suitable that

ALESHIN, recently assigned to the American Department as

Deputy Chief, be given this responsibility.

NOSENKO had previously been questioned in detail on

his resposibilities in the U.S. Embassy Section, and had never

bofore mentioned this one.

SOSENKO told CI. In June 1964

that when he reported for duty in the U.S, Eabassy Section

in January 1960,

DR.1'OY was the responsible case officer for

the Naval Attaches and Marines.

Soon after his own arrival,

NOSENKO said, DRANOV was transferred from the section and

responsibilities were

taken over by BELOGLAZOV, who had

earlier been as-üting DRANOV agalnst these targets.

NOSENKO said on 20 October 1966 that inmediately upon.

"I took the files only on the Navy, but I was working

k. IDY to Bulgaria and the LUNT Case

In the spring of 1261, NOSENKO said, four months after

returning

from Cuba, he was told unexpectedly that in about.

a week's time he would leave for bulgaria to consult with

the Arerican Departuent of the Bulgarian MVR corcerning

operations against the Anerican Legation in Sofia (Pages

279-283).

NOSENKO flew to Sofia in early April 1961, where

he was met by A.S. HOLLOY,

an advisor there and a forrer

employee of the Second Chief Directorate whom NOSENKO had

known at KGB Headquarters.

NOSEYKO remained in Bulgaria

until about the middle cf May:

While there he discussed

both general

matters and particular

cases with the Bul-

garians,

gave

several lectures on operations against Aneri-

can installations and personnel

as well as against tourists,.

and finally

directed the successful homosexual operation

against the American Professor LUST.

Aside from being told that he would be advising :he

Bulgarian service on

• operations against Americans at the

Legation in

Sofia, NOSENKO

apparently received no prepara

tion for this trip.

He said in answer to specific questions

that nobody told him what he was sumposed to discuss with

the Bulgarians,

that he did not meet with the Bulgarian

liaison representatives in Moscol before leaving, and that

he knew nothing of the organization, personnel, area of

responsibility, or problems of

American Department of

the Bulgarian service before arriving in Sofia.

NOSENKO was selected for this mission despite the fact

he was extremely busy with his duties in the U.S. Erbassy

Section (see above discussion of his responsibilities for

code clerks, ABIDIAN, and the military attaches) and despite

the fact that KOLOV was permanently assigned as an advisor

in Sofia.

NOSEYIO described KOZLOV in another context as a

"very experienced officer"

and has said that KOZLOY was. Chief

of the American Departrent until 1953 and then from June 1955

until sometime in 1958 was Deputy Chief of the Tourist De:

partment,

(KOZLOV, assisted by

NOSENKO, had recruited BUPGI in June 1956.)

Asked why kOlLO

could not have advised the Bulgarians, NOSENKO said that he

from active operations in Moscow too long.

•. Transfer to the Tourist Department

Some time in the fall of 1961, YOSENKO said, he heard

of GRIBANOV's decision to promote hinto the position of

Deputy Chief of the eatire

American Department.

JOSENKO. - -

however, knew that his chief and friend KOVSHUK ranted the

Job. and that FEDOSEYEV (Chief of the Department) also favored

KOVSHUK for this position.

Realizing that his own appoint

ment sould therefore place him in a difficult position ard

wishing to avoid this, NOSENKO spoke to the Chiel of the

Tourist Department, CHELYOKOV, about returning there.

At

CHELSOKOV'S sUggestion. NOSENKO went to GRIBANOV with the

request to be returned to the Tourist Department as Chief

of the American Tourist Section, with the understanding that

he would be sade Deputy Chief of the fourist Department

upon the retirement of the incumbent. BALDIN, in July 1962.

To this GRIBANOY agreed.

NOSENKO said that GRIBINOV did

not discuss with himhis reasons for wanting to appoint him

Deputy Chief of the American Department or for appointing

him Chief of the American Tourist Section, nor did ne discuss

with NOSENKO his personal requirements for these positions.

in early 1965, XOSENKO said that it wag

because GRIBANOV "thought I was a tough guy, a good case

officer.

In 1959 I saw him often and was involved in a lot.

of questiors which were reported to him."

According to

his most recent version, NOSENKO was officially transferred

from the American Department at the end of December 1961

and reported

for duty in the Tourist Department on about

3 January 1962.

KOVSHLK, who was also a candidate for the job as Deputy

Chief of the

American Department, had earlier held

this po-

sition, according to NOSENKO and COLITSYN.

sonally involved in many of the nore significant American

Department operations

during the previous decade.

Tbese in-

cluded the recruitments of RIODES

and SMITH (the latter one

01 NOSENKO's most important leads, according to NOSENKO):

the handling of SHAPIRO; the attempts to recruit STORSBERG,

HARISTONE, and HANNHEIM; the development of the ClA officer

MINTERS ard the interrogation of LANGELLE in connection Eith

The POPOV arrest.

By contrast, GRIBANOV's original candidate for the job,

NOSENKO, was present when KOZLO recruited BURGl, and himself

recruited HARRIS and five homosexual tourists tho visited

the Soviet Union in 1959:

Furthermore, NOSENKO's perfor-

mance as Deputy Chief of

the U.s. Embassy Section. as he

admitted under interrogation, was "not good."

NOSENKO has given many contradictory dates for his

transfer to the Tourist Department.

In 1962 NOSEYKO said

at various times that this took place in January 1962 and

in February 1962: in 1964 he timed the transfer as falling

some time between 15 and 20 January 1962; and in February

1965 he arrived at the date of 2 or 3 January 1962, after

It was pointed out that he appeared in the approach to w.E.

JOHNSON on 5 January.

(On this basis, he said that the

official order was issued about 25 December 1961 and that

he turned over his files to his

successor GRYAZNOV several

days later.)

JOSENKO contradicted this latter estimate.

however, by saying that he was in the U.S. Embassy Section

Departent by the time COLITSYN defectud; ha placed this on

15 January 1962 and refused to belleve the correct date of

15 December 1961.

D. Remarks

For no single responsibility has NOSENKO substantiated

his alleged service as Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy

Section in the years 1960-1961.

His statements about the

appointment to and transter from this position have been

Inconsistent; his comparatively narrow experience and hig

ackoowledged falsehoods about a personal relationship with

the Chief of the KGB Second Chief Directorate, GRIBAYOV,

dispel the likelihood that these porsonnel aseignments were

made in the way be claims.

Repoatedly he has been contra

dictory about his activities during this two-year period,

shifting his story to suit the occasion and ignoring bow

each

7. Tourist velartment (1962-1964)

a. Introduction

NOSLNKO agreed during the interrogationg at the beginning

of 1965 that ho must have reported for duty as Chief of the

American Tourist Section on about 3 January 1962.*

In tris

job he was responsible for planning and supervising KGB acti-

vities against all tourists of American, British, and Caradian

nationalities arriving in the USSR, and his duties also encom-

passed preparationg fur the coming tourist season (Pages 295-

287).

In July 1962, in conformity with GRIbANUV's intenciong,

NOSENKO was promoted to the position of Deputy Chief of the

entire Tourist Department; it had a taule of organization o!

close to 100 staff officers, was responsible for handling opera

tions ayainst all tourists to the Soviet Union, and mairtained

the facilities

used in these operations.

A year later NOSENKO

received the title of first Deputy Chief of the Departnert, a

"paper" pronotion as there was no other deputy.

During this

pericd in the Tourist Department, in addition to his supervi-

iconcerning which he has not been questioned in

detail), NOSEriKO

took personal part in approaches to several

tourists, organized and directed the arrest of an American

tourist on homosexual charges, and met wich a number of agents.

It was his sorior supervisory position that involved him in two

of the most widely publicized cases

of this period, the arrest

Of BARGHOORN and the case of OSWALi.

b. ibse:ces from Moscow

During his two years in the Tourist Department, NOSENKO

was available to perform his assigned duties only part of the

time. After arriving in the American Tourist Section and after

the approach to JOHNSON on 5 January 1962, NOSENKO spent seve

eral weeks

"getting the feel" of things by talking to case offi-

cers, reviewing reports of the section's activities during the

previous

tro years,

and discussing plans for the up-coning tour-

ist season.

In mid-February he began preparations

ment to Geneva with the Disarmament Delegation.

NOSENKO has

said that this involved discussions with the Eleventh Depart

ment of the Second Chief Directorate, responsible for arranging

for security coverage of Soviet delegations going abroad, as

well as with the case officers responsible

for the investigation

of suspected American agent SIlAKHOV.

NOSENKO said that

this on a part-time basis in addition to his regular duties,

but has loied in another context that these preparations required

sufficient time to make it impossible for him to take a personal

part in the recruitment of BIENSTOCK ir February 1962.

15 March 1962, NOSENKO arrived in Geneva, remaining there with

the delegation

until 15 June, when he left Geneva by train to

return to Moscow to reassume his duties as Chief of Section.

(He said that he had no deputy chief in this position, and

is unclear who performed these functions in his absence.

according to NOSENKO's account, of the six months he was Chief

* This date was settled upon after he acknowledged that his

approach to the American tourist W.E. JOHNSON must have

occurred on 5 January.

a decision

made that he was not worth the effort

as he had no access to classifies

materiuls and lived too tar

Several days after this deci-

made, postal intercepts showed that SCINSON was writing

to be done to stop him.

to entrap him on this basis and surce him to promise not to

The compromise was effected

by use of NOSENKo's homosexual agents,

and NOSENKO was able to

describe the confrortation scene, his second meeting with JOHN-:

SON, and JOHNSON's frightened telephore call to the U.S. Embassy

reporting that NOSENKO had recortacted him.

NOSENKO told CIA in June 1962 that he had taken part in

this operation

"an January."

When he contacted CIA in Geneva

in 1964 he had

a scrap of paper on which was noted JOHNSON a

name and the date "5 January 1962."

This was the actual date

of the approach, but NOSENKO insisted that the date bore no

relationship to the name, and that the approach to JOHNSON took

place in the sumer of 1962, a fact he recalled distinctly be-

cause he wore no overcoat.

It was only when confronted with

official U.S. records that NOSENKO agreed in early 1965 that

the apprcach was in January and recalled that it was made

Immediately aftor NOSENKO returned to the Tourist Department.*

NOSENRO said that when JOHNSON first arrived in Moscow

there was consideration of recruiting him, but that there was

a decision against this as he was of little intelligence value.

Then JOHNSON mailed insulting letters which were picked up

through postal

intecept. About the same time there were indi

cations of homosexuality.

Then the operation wag mounted

• against him.

This imples a very tight time schedule. JOHNSON

arrived in Moscow on 31 December 1961; NOSENKO said he reported

for duty as Section Chief on 3 January 19628 JOHNSON reported

his first contact with NOSENKO'& homosexual agent VOLKOV the

evening of 4 January; and the approach by NOSENKO was on 5 Janu-

Although NOSENKO implied in 1962 that his homosexual agents

VOLKOV and YEFREMOV were the ones who originally determined

NOSENKO did not know what these indications were or

where

they came

fron.

JOHNSON reported that he first met the

agent VOLKOV on

the

evening of 4 January when the latter sat

down at his restaurant table; on this same occasion VOLKOV in-

vited JOHNSON to his hotel room ihe next day.

The fact that

VOLKOV joined JOHNSON uninvited and set him up for the approach

without

leaving the table suggests that there had,

in fact,

been signs of his homosexuality beforehand and that operational

plans had been laid by this time.

NOSENKO has described the caution taken in other homosexual

entrapment cases and has named several which were called off

because

of a risk of

scardal.

It is, therefore, unusual that

the KGB would take this risk merely to force JOHNSON,

an

American and a Baptist minister, to stop writing insulting let-

ters and articles.

NOSENKO did not know why he became involved in this opera-

tion the day after he reported for duty in the senior position

of Section Chief.

He said only that BOBKOV, a Deputy Chief of

the Second Chief Directorate, told him to do it.

During his

talks with JOHNSON, NOSENKO introduced himself to JOHNSON as

"Georgiy

Ivanovich NIKOLAYEV," (rendered by JOHNSON as NIKOLOV)

the Chief of Police."

(11) The BARGHOORN Provocation-Arrest

place at the end of October 1963,

at the time NOSENKO said he

was First Deputy Chief of the Tourist Department.

JOHNSO!:

It was an operation

in which there was no thought of recruitment, and BARGHOOS was

able to identify NOSENKO as a participant.

BARGHOOR' reported that the day after his arrest he was

questioned by the same officer who had interrogated him the

evening before about the "compromising materials" which had

been planted on him.

With this officer on this one occasion

was his "chief," whom PARGHOORN subsequently identified by photo-

graph as NOSENKO.

NOSENKO has sald that he was told by the

Chief of the Tourist Departnent that GRIPANOV wanted him (SOSENKO)

present in the interrogation room it the time when BARGHOOP:

admitted that he had the compromising information in his posses-

sioh at the tire of aercot.

NOSENKO did not linow why his par-

ticular presence was needed or denirca, but he complied despite

that he did not want to reveal his face to BARG::OOPY

as he knew BARGHOORN would be relcased.

NoSeiro said that he

officer secured this admission and then he left.

officer until 1964, when he defected.

(1) PRIPPEL

Having left his assignment in Moscow in early 1961, FRIPPEL

(Pages 129-133' and Part VIII.D.5.) returned several times to

the soviet Union in 1962 and 1963.

NOSENKO, who remained his

case officer although PRIPIEL now lived and worked in New York

City, met him each time.

FRIPPEL said there were three guch

occasions, in February 1962 when he net once with NOSEiKO and

CHELNOKOV

in Odessa, and two later times in Moscow and Odessa,

when NOSENKO came alone.

NOSENKO denied that he met FRIPPEL

in Odessa in February 1962 with CHELNOKOV, but said that he met

twice with him alone after returning to Moscow from Geneva.

The first of these meetings was in the surmer of 1962 when

PEL was accompanying

a group of American newspaper editors tour-

ing the Soviet Union.

FRIPPEL said NOSENKO called briefly at

his hotel room to enquire what questiong the editors planned

to ask KHRUSHCHEV during a planned interview.

said he did not know, NOSENKO departed and FRIPPEL later re-

ported that he did not see NOSENKO again on this trip:

said he called again after the interview to learn the

"reactions"

of the editors.)

The second meeting was in Odessa, when FRIPPEL,

visited the Soviet Union as a guide on a tour ship. According

to FRIPPEL,

it was on this occasion that NOSENKO apparently made

a phone call to ask permission to go aboard FRIPPEL's ship, and

it might have been at this meeting or the eurlier one that

ROSENKO told him something of his personal background. (FRIPPEL

knew a considerable amount of information about NOSENKO's father

and family.) NOSENKO denied the possibility that he would have

to request permission to board the vessel and

said that if he

had told FRIPPEL anything about himself, it was when! he was

drunk.

Both FRIPPEL and NOSENKO agreed that FRIPPEL provided

no information of value during any of these meetirgs..

(11) SVENCHANSKIY

NOSENKO has cited SVENCHANSKIY, KGB cryptonym "ANOD,* as

an example of the Second Chief Directorate's use of foreign

travel agents to signal the KGB when an interesting tourist is

about to visit the Soviet Union (Pages 295-298) .

SVENCHANSKIY

was recruited for this purpose, NOSENKO said, in 1961 and used

to send open-code signals to the Tourist Department by marking

visa applications whenever he spotted anything significant.

Some of SVENCHANSKIY's signals had been, considered, NOSENKO

said, "of definite operational interest."

In September 1963,

NOSENKO took the case over from the previous handling officer.

NOSKOV,

and his name was listed in SVENCHANSKIY's file as the

responsible officer.

occasions, NOSKOV was present.

NOSENTO said that at the tine SVENCHANSKIY as recruited

that, because

SVENCHANSKIY was known to have had con

tacts with AUTORS in New York,

there was some suspicion that

he might be an FBI agent. NOSENKO was unable to be more pre-

cise as to the basis for these auspicions and, when asked how

NOSKOV had resolved them, was able to say only tha: NOSKOV

"felt" that SVENCHANSKIY

was not an Anerican agent.

NOSENKO knew little about SVENCHANSKIY's background from

the one-volume file kept on him in the Tourist Department:

He

did know that SVENCHANSKIY was recruited in 1961 on the promise

of commercial favors, that he had at one tine been detected

in blackmarket trangactions in the USSR,

and that in addition

to his travel agency, SVENCHANSKIY ran a Russian-language book-

store in Chicago.

FBI and CIA records show that SVENCHANSKIY

has becn employed by a series of registered Soviet Goverment

organizations in the United States since the early 1930's,

that he was released from his position as a United Mations radio

officer broadcasting to the Soviet Union in 1952 when he failed

to answer questions of the Senate Interral Security Committee

concerning

alleged subversive activity, and that both his travel

agency and his book store are affiliated with registered sov-

let agencies.

Inturist and Mechkniga.

Allegations on file of

SVENCHANSKIY'S Communist sympathies and probable Soviet espion-

age activities date back to the Second World War.

In August

1950,

Harry GOLD linked SVENCHANSKIY to the Soviet espionage

network in the United

gates during the war.

The FBI

has re-

ported

GOLOS, the "director of Soviet espion-

age in the

United States."

(NOSENKO knew that someone called

Sonya worked for SVENCHANSKIY in New York, but said that she

is not a KGB agent and was not the one who marked the visa

applications.)

e. The OSWALD Investigation

As First Deputy Chief of the Tourist Department, NOSENKO

said, he was directiy irvolved in the investigation

of OSWAlD's

activities in Minsk which was ordered after the assassination

of President KENNEDY (2ages 136-144 and Part VIII.D.5.).

is from his role at this

time and his reading of the Minsk KGB

file on

OSWAID that NCSEiKO derived his authority to state

the KGB

"washed its hands of OSWALD" after his attempted sui-

cide in the USSR, that there was no attempt to recruit either

SWALD or his wife, and that KGB interest in OSWALD while he

lived in Minsk was restricted to passive observation.

g. Remarks

Leaving

aside NOSCHKO's unsubstantiated clains to super-

visory jobs in

the Tourist Department in 1962-1953, when he

indicated he was absent from KGB Headquarters nearly half of

the time, his persorgl roe in operatiors and investigations

of the period

appears artificial in sone instances and in-

plausible i. others.

NOSENKO E knowleuge of the origins of

the JOHNSON case is incomplete, the timing conflicts with other

activities attributed to himself, the erpressed purpose of

the compronise in

unique, and the outcons seems to have little

consequence beyord enabling JOHNSON to confirm

that NOSENNO

appeared in it.

Although BRAUNS may have been

in a position

to corioborate NOSE:R0's appearance

rot done so and his staterents contradice NOSENKO on the part

At various tines since contacting CIA in 1962, NOSENKO

described a series of awards and decorations which

he received

over

the years

for his performance of duties in the Second Chief

Directorate

lle claimed to have received the

Order of Lenin, the Order of the Red Star, and the Order of the

said he received a special

commendation from

KGB Chairman SEROV for nis role in the BURGI recruitment and

the same award in 1959 for his recruitment of all of the Ameri..

can or British tourists recruited that year by

the KGB (three

British and three

American homosexuals).

NOSENKO told of a

number of other conmendations which he received-almost one

year--for his

"general good work."

In October 1966 NOSENKO

said that he never received any awards for his KGB operational

performance, only a medal for satisfactory completion of 10

years of KGB service and a Red Army anniversary medal.

b. Ranks

NOSENKO's descriptions of his various rank promotions fol

low a similar but more complicated pattern (Pages 322-326).

He has given tro

separate sets of circumstances for his first

promotion, from junior lieutenant to lieutenant.

According to

the first

of these,

the one NOSENKO adhered to during 1964 and

1965,

he was promoted to che rank of lieutenant while serving

in the Far East with the naval GRU at the beginning of 1951.

NOSENKO explained

that the required time in grade is sometimes

cut in half

for officers serving at this undesirable post, and

that thig is why he

was

pronoted after only six months of

active duty.

In 1966 NCSENKO gaid for the first time that he

did rot enter on active duty until March 1951 and that his

promotion to lieutenant was in mid-1952, while stationed in

Sovetsk, on the Baltic.

In all his accounts, NOSENKO has said

that he entered the KGB with the zank of lieutenant as this

had been his rank ir the naval GRU.*

During his first meetings with CIA in Geneva during 1962

claimed then to be a KGB major and said that he had

already completed the necessary time in grade for a lieutenant

colonelcy.

of the structure of his salary as a major (so much for rank,

so much for longevity, etc.) and pointed out that he was fill-

GRISKiOV himself and testifled to it by his signalure on the

"official biographical statement" prepared in Frankfurt.

The first major change in NOSENKO's story of his promo-

tions cane durirg the interrogations of januar! 1965 when he

volunteered out of context and for no cloor reason that he had

never held the rank of major but rather, because of a scries

of administrative slip-ups and GRIBANOV's alvis: and help, had

jumped cirecily from the rank of captain, which h received

in 1956, to the rank of lieutenant colonel in lito 1963.

NOSENKO was later to claim that he had never said

in 1962 tha:

he was a major."

In an unsolicited statenent given to cIA in April 1966,

NOSENKO wrole that he was only a captain and thuc the Tly autori

2. Affiliation with Communist Parti Organs

1944 without giving the step any thoight whatsoever.

Section of the American Depart

ment in 1953, NOSENKO told CIA, he was appointed Secretary of

the amall Komsomol Organization of the Second Chief Director-

ate, & group of about 17 members.

b. Discussion

NOSENIO was questioned by DERYABIN on his duties as Kom

somol Secretary (Pages 623) and, although able to give a super-

ficial account of these functions, was

found to be unaware of

certain basic information which DERYABIN felt

a person

in this

positior

should have.

Thus, for example, NOSLiKO provided a

of levying dues on Konsomol members

which was substantlally incorrect and was unaware that a kom-

sonol Congress (the first in sany years and therefore a major

event) had been held during his claimed tenure

as Secretary.

NOSENKO said that he held the position of komosmol Organi-

zation Secretary

until the late spring of early summer of 1954,

when he got into

trouble for naving used official KGB alias

documentation to

conceal the

fact that he received treatent

for venereal disease contracted from a prostitute.

Immediately

aîter this incident, said NOSENKO, he was removed

from nis

position

and a

"strict reprimand"

was placed in his Kom-

somel file.

Several months thereafter, on the eve of his 27ch

birthday, NOSENKO was forced out of the Komsomol because he was

too old.

For over a year, until

January 1956 when NOSE:KO was

admitted as a candidate member of the Communist Party of the

Soviet Union!

he was the orly officer in the KGB who was neither

Komsonol nor a

Party member.

POSINKO's account of his expul-

sion

tradicted by the official Statutes of the Komsomol in effect

at that time.

c. Remarks

The fact that NOSENKO is incorrect regarding the age limi-

tation makes it doubtful that his account of the venereal

disease incident and his removal from the Komsomol Secretary-

ship is true.

The date which he gives to this incident is

after that on which he should have been expelled from the Kon

(Additionally, NOSENKO's descriptions of the veneral

disease incident, his

use of false documents, and his subsequent

punishment by the KGB and the Komsomol have been inconsistent:

3. SchooLing

a. Introduction

There is relatively little reliable collateral irformation

concerning NOSEIKO's schooling up until 1950.

Other than what

he himself has reported, available information consists of over:!

press releases pertaining to the Minister NOSEYKO's career land

giving his location at vardous times) and comments by one KGB

officer and one defector.

NOSENKO's own ascount, together with

references to these other sources, is surnarized below.

With the exception of minor variations in dates, attribut-

able to memory, NOSENKO's. story of his early years until the

• beginning of World War II, shen he had just completed the sixth

grade in Moscow, has been generally consistent in its various

cellings.

Moreover, his accourts of having studied in Lenin-

grad and

Moscow agree with information concerning the positions

and movements of the elder NOSENKO during these years.

trast,

the pericd immediately following, during which

allegedly received his early training in naval matters is char-

acterized with freyuent changes of story, contradictions, and

admitted falsehood.

b. Discussion

In 1964 and 1965 NOSEIKO recalled that he enrolled in the

Moscow special naval school in the summer of 1941, immediately

after the Germans attacked the Soviet Union, and was evacuiled

with the entire school from Moscow to Kuybyshev in September

to begin studies in the seventh grade.

(An artiele in the sov-

let Army newspaper Kragnaya Zvezda (Red Star) on 14 January 1967

confirmed that seven special naval schools were established in

the Soviet Union in April 1940.

Ore of these was in Moscow.

However, to be eligible for admission,

one had to have completed!

the seventh grade. The article did not indicate that the Moscow

school was evacusted.) In April 1966, NOSENKO remembered that

he did no= go to Kuybyshey at this time but rather had been

evacuated so Chelyabinsk with his mother and entered the seventh

grade of a regular school.

In keeping with his respective accounts, NOSENKO said in

1964 and 1965 that he returned from Kuybyshev in the sumer of

secured amission to the Leningrad Naval Preparatory

School,

with which he was evacuated by train to Paxu in

the fall of that year.

In April 1966,

after inserting the year

spent at Chelyabinsk with his mother, NOSENKO moved all events

up a year and wote in his autobiography that he entered the

Kuybyshev school in the fall of 1942 rather than the fall of

NOSENKO also wrote at this time that he transferred to

the Leningrad preparatory school and travelled to Baku in the

fall of 1943, not 1942."

* Describing the reasons for his transfer to the Leningrad Naval

Preparatory School, POSENKO explained that the Moscow special

school was evasuated further to Achinsk in Siberia and

that this was farther from home than he wished to go.

Red Star article menticned above said that the special naval

schools were all closed in 1943, however.

The spectal school

admitted thet thig was a lic.

By cutting the time he was in

plicitly that his accounts of the basic trainirg he received

in the preparatory school, of the summer he spert working at

the school rather than returning to Moscow on vacatica, ard of

his "certainty" that he colebrated his 15th birthday in Baku

were also false.

NOSENKO has been relatively consistent in recounting the

events of 1944.

In 1964, 1965 and again in 1966 he told of

studying as an "external"

student in Mosco's to complete his

ninth year of schooling and of rejoining his classmates from

Baku when the naval preparatory school returned to Lenirgrad

in the autumn of 1÷44.

On

several occasions during 1964 and

1965, NOSENKO described how he and his classmates spent Detober

and November 1944 working in the woods near Leringrad before

beginning

their terth grade studies late in the

year; he omitted

this account from his April 1966 autobiography.

NOSENKO's account of the next years is similarly marked

with a number of inconsistencies and falsehoods.

(In the

latter category he has clained and later admitted as untrue that

he attended

the Frunze Naval Academy from 1943

to 1944, that

he was on active military duty until being demobilized

in 1915,

and that he was shot ir the hand by a jealous young

naval offi

cer in 1945.

According to the account given under

interroga"

tion in April 1964, NOSENKO was shot in

the hand at a party in

the end of april 1945, was hospitalized, resigned from

the

preparatory school, and received a certificate of satisfactory

completion of the

tenth

grade, although he had been in school

only since November 1944.

In 1965 and 1966 NOSENKO said, re-

pectively, that he was shot by a nava. officer in februar

or March

1945

and that he shot himself in

"early" 1945: since

the 1964 interrogations he has claimed only that he received

a statement of the courses he had attended at the preparatory

school and that he completed the tenth grade at the Shipbuild-

ing Tekhnikun in Leningrad.

F. Appraisals of NOSEYKO, his Motivation, and Other Opera-

Fional Circuastaaces

1. Introduction

Appraisals of NOSENKO the man and of his motivationg

must be founded, as with any source, on factors which are

often immeasureable, but fever reservations need be attached

to an appraisal of the other circumstances affecting the

course of events in Geneva in 1962 and 1964.

These opera

tional circumstances can be analyzed and evaluated in much

the same manner as were NOSENKO's production,

sourcing,

and

blography for they are tangible pleces of evidence.

In the

next portions of this paper are presented these appraisals.

which draw chiefly upon Pages 603-641 (for NOSENKO the man),

Pages 20-29 (for his motivations), and Pazes 11-19 and 30-

2. NOSENKO

The CIA specialists who assessed NOSENKO foubd him to

be of above-average intelligence,

one of them saylog that

"his effective intelligence 18 more cleverness than intel

lectuality, more shrewduess than efficlency, " He is capable

of good memory and, ag illustrated by bis repeating certain

details.

On the other hand, there were

nurerous internal

contradictious in NOSENKO's recountings

of various events, he himself claimed an odd or poor menory,

and

he

was the oxceptioral defector by having been totally

debriefed within a relatively short period.

Parts VIM. D. and VIII.E. discuss NOSENKO's truthfulness

with reference to his Soviet

Intelligence ard

personal

backgrounds.

Here nay be added other observations by the

CIA specialists:

NOSENKO can exercise deception cleverly,

he improvised

and

was evasive under interrogation, and he

has a "remarkable" disregard for te truth where it serves

his purposes.

The results of the polygraph examination "ere

that NOSENKO "attempted deliberate deception."

The gaps and errors in, NOSENKO's testimony therefore

do not seem attributable to

low intelligence or to consis-

tently poor memory, but to a conscious attempt to mislead

American Intelligence.

Independently, then,

this conclusion

raiseg the questions of whether NOSENKO was dispatched by

the KGB and If so, why he was chosen.

3. Motivation

Part of onc's motivation for such a drastic act as

treason or defection may not be wholly cooscious, and there

may be underlying causes which any source night not want

or be able to adait even to hinself.

Thus, what rOSENKO

said about motivation need not be taken at face value, and

for this reason the whole question of his motivation must

remain a minor weight in the overall assessent of bona fides.

NOSENKO has tried to present a meaningful explacation

has changed or adjusted his story to this end.

initially insisted

that he had no ideological motives but

simply wanted to

"make a deal" in order

to get out of

trouble; yet this claim is open to question:

The snouat of

operational money which NOSENKO needed to replace was hardly

enough to have driven him to treason, especially sirce

there were friends

The discre-

pancy between the degree of the neud and the scriousness of

of the act was so evident that the CIA case officer commented

to NOSENKO at the outset that there rust be some deeper

explanation for his act. Thereupon YOSEYKO added new

reasons:

His distaste for certain aspects of the regine,

his resentment of KHRUSHCHEY, aad his liking for imericans.

abroad any more.

(This contradicts YOSENKO's 1962 state-

anticipating innirent prosotion to Deputy Department

Chief, he said that he would leave the ISSR at least once

a year in the future.)

For no visible reason NOSE'KO seems

to have abandoned a purportedly successful and promising

career, an undisturbed jamily life and children of shom

he was

fond, cast shane on his father's menory ud his re-

maining relatives, and departed forever from his of country.

His own unease concerning his motivation evidently con-

tinued until, in 1965,

he wrote one cohesive expla-ation.

No part of this statement was ever borne out by his conduct,

attitudes, remarks or reactions.

He appeared, wherever his

reactions

seemed spontaneous,

to dislike the United States,

to have no interest in it politically, culturally. or

scenically, and to preserve a preference for the USSE.

A

CIA graphologist comnented on NOSEYKO's "strong emotional

traditional background," while & CIA psycholo-

gist reported:

"Emotionally

he has not deiccted in spite

of his attempt to intellectually rationalize that he bag."

The psychologist also said that it is

"almost impossible to

determine his

true loyaltics and true beliefs."

there) until six weeks after arrival: GRISANOV played s

b. Fresence in Geneva (1964)

SESENKO said on one occasion that GE!BAYOY was che of

those who allored him to come to Geneva in January 1964,

as a personal favor;* he later not only dealed this tut said

in 1965 that GRIBAYOV knew nothing about the ILY.

le re-

ported the 19G: TDY night, because of his ner positio!,

be his last trip to the desi,

hence the "favor" of his

superiors to perait his this last trip; in 1962 YOSENKO

said he had the assurance that as Deputy Upartrent Chief

(which he knew be was about to becore) he sould in the future

cone to the rest at least once a year.

Also, NOSENKO could

not explain why a First Deputy Departuent Chief, if allowed

out of the USSR as a "treat," would Ro abroad for a conference

which could be expected to

last sany secis, probably sonths.

This question is compounded

by the fact that NOSEiRO would

be necded in Moscow:

He said that a KiS conference to plan

the handling of the tourist season was to be held at about

this tire, and he stuck to this story even aiter admitting

that the telegras recalling him for this Moscow conference

was an invention (see below).

c. Access to KGB Residency and Availability to CIA

NOSENKO in 1962 routinely visited the KGB Legal Resi-

dency in Geneva every weekday mornirg, although he claimed

that he had no reason and that it is

did so in Geneva, YOSENKO has given differect angers at

different times.

His stories of simply "dropping to and

hanging arourd" for lack of anything better to do are

unacceptable in terms of know or likely Sovlet practice.

His explanation that it was due to TSYABAL's auspices or

or intervention sere contradicted by:

First, his or con-

fused accounts of bis relationship with TSYNBAL; and second,

his own statements at other tines that it was GUK who ras

primarily responsible for NOSENXO's visits to the Residency.

NOSENKO had a full day free for metings on ll June

1962, although thereafter he limited meeting tines to shortes

and

shorter periods until his departure.

This seemed

natural at the time since he would presumably have his own

responsibilities and would need to be seen by his Soviet

colleagues in his proper surroundings.

However, in 1964

he seemed not to save any official responsibilities or any

calls on his time:

He was willing to spend all his

time in

meetings with CIA. Although this could be explained by the

fact that he plained to defect anyway, it nevertheless vould

have

lovolved undecessary risks to a geruine source about

to becone a defector.

Ho showed no concern at the time,

but later (in 1966),

he said that he had been in fact afraid:

it was for this reason that he invented the Moscow recall

telegram,

in order to hasten nis defection and put an end

to his fears of getting caught.

It is, of course,

impossible

to sake conclusive judgments on Soviet practice, but one

would expect,

1f NOSENKO were not engaged in security duties,

that he would be required to participate for cover reasons

in more of the Soviet delegation's official activity.

said that any absence could be explained as "security dutles,"

since everyone on the Soviet Delegation knew or suspected

that he was a KGB officer.

This unconcern for the suspicions

of other Soviets conforms neither with observed Soviet

practice nor with reports from other sources that Soviet

intelligence and security officers under cover go to some

pains to hide their true affiliation.

NOSENKO explained the contrast between his freedom

in 1964 and his limited free tine in 1962

by the fact that in 1964 be had no personal friends in

Geneva; in 1962 both GUK and KISLOV expected to see bia to

his free time.

(This story does not explain his ability in

1964 to get away during conference working hours; neitter

GUK nOr KISLOV affected this in 1962.)

d. Timing of 1962 Contact

NOSENKO had been in Geneva for three months in 1962

hen the incident which brought him to CIA occurred; it

was only tro weeks before his departure.

He came to Dauld

MARK only

10 days before leaving.

This bad tze effect of

laiting CIA's time with him.

NOSES*O's contact came only

about 10 days after CIA had completed, in the same city, a

series of meetings with BELITSKIY, a Soviet interpreter

who

bad been recruited and handled as

an agent by CIA during

NOSE:KO, as one of the tro

e. Willing.ess to Meet CIA

Although in 1962 NOSENKO claimed that te banted 2o

sell only two specific items for the noncy he had lost, and

cher. disappear e

there were indicationg from the outset

that

he exoccted and

planned to core back for further meetings

With CIA.

At this first meeting he called attention

to

certain information in his

possession about POPOV, hinting

that he would tell it later; even as he protested his unwilling

ness

to continue meeting with cla,

he was giving ample

details about himself which would inevitably have compro

mised him to ClA and forced his future collaboration.

Befora

he finally agreed to return for more incetings,

he said:

"Mayte I'll reet you again Monday" (tro days after the

first

Beeting) .

NOSENKO refused, despite

repcated inducerents,

to ncet

on the intervening

Sunday.

fact, when he did

return on Monday, he said that he had spent Surday with

friends, drinking and discussing

recent ussk foreign policy

roves and speeches by KliRUSiCkEY."

f. Tice Recall Telegran

NOSENKO's confession that he labricated the story of

his havira been urgent!: recaiind te

leaves only two

possaule arterpretations:

- There was a telegran, but NOSENiO's mind has

slipped and he is no longer able

to distinguish between

fact and fancy.

his, horever, is not borne out by

cis general conduct nor his performance under interro

gation in

19€6.

- There was, in fact, no telegrat. (This is borne

out by Special

Intellicorce.)

Thus, the irvention was

thE KGU DrIeled SENKO to report to CIA that a

telegram was sent; and HOSENKO made an crror in later

admitting that it was not.

Remarks

The operational circumstances so far reviewed point

out the facts that:

- NOSENKO was inconsistent if not contradictory in

stating his reasons for being in Geneva in 1962 and

1964;

- He had unusual access to the KGD Legal Residency

and an availabilily for meeting CIA that seemed to

impinge upon his security:

- He was willing to return to meetings with CIA al

though having at first said that there were but two

items of information for sale:

20.33

- He was "in place" as a CIA source for the last

six of his 100 or so days in Geneva in 1962, thus

restricting the anount of time he could provide continu-

ing reporting on the local Legal Residency: and

- After 12 days in the same status in 1964,

he

forced the defection by the KGB recall telegram, which

appears to have been a fabrication.

Taken

together,

these facts suggest the possibilities

tbat the KGB sent NOSENKO to Geneva on both orcegions for

the purpose of contacting CIA, that the KCB wanted the

opportunity to gauge ClA's reactiong to the walk-in in 1962

and to the defection plang in 1964, and that the KGB gutrd

NOSENKO after contact was established in both years.

A further examination of the operational circumstances

Geneva lends credence to these possibilitles.

visited the Legal Residency.

In 1964 there were other

exasples of what may have been backstage guidance by the

-He called for an urgent special meeting to cor-

rect sunething he had said in an earlier needing.

Initially NOSENKO had named ZUJUS instead of KEYSERS

as the U.S. Embassy code clerk

whom he had personally

approached in 1961:

This seened remarkably urgent and

important to him at the time, and in retrospect this

case gains special importance:

It was the only time

he claimed to have had direct contact with a U.S.

Embassy staff employee during his alleged tour in the

American Department in 1960-1961.

If he could not

remember this one name, it might call his entire story

into question.

It is hard to find snother explanation;

had he simply made a careless mistake, with his cus

tomary indifference to names and dates. NOSENKO would

be unlikely to mull over what he had said at the meeting

nor to bother about correcting a minor misstatement.

Much less would he feel compelled to coll an erergency

meeting to do so.

-He came to meetings with "chance" items picked

up at the Legal Residency, each of which would require

quick action and the commitment of assets on the part

of CIA iD Geneva.

Also, NOSESKO originally said in

January 1964 that he wanted to defect right away, but

various steps taken or planned by his ClA handlers

kept him in place for a time.

Each step, however. was

quickly negated-usually at the next meeting-by some

information NOSPNKO had picked up by chance.

-He asked, out of context and without any explana

tion, whether

GOLITSYN had told CIA that the President

of Finland was a Soviet agent, and later could not

coherently explain

where he had heard this,

whr he had

not told CIA about it in

1962, and why he had asked.

In addition, the Soviet reactions to the defection were

unprecedented and contrasted sharply with, for example, the

Soviets' avoidance of

publicity concerning GOLITSYN's defec-

t lon in 1961.

The post-defection actions by the Soviet

Government created publicity

which had the superficial effect

of underlining NOSENKO's authenticity, establishing him as

H. Alternative Explanations

1. Introduction

•Parts VIII.B, through VIII.f. have discussed the

inaccuracies,

self-admitted contradictions, inconsistencies,

and incompleteness of NOSENKO'& reporting about himself and

these irportant flaws in the story

of and by NOSENKO make

it necessary to choose an explanation

for his actions and the nature of his information.

There

are three alternatives:

Pirst, NOSENKO was a KGB officer but (a) has

a faulty or

selective mesosy, has embellished or

boasted, or his reporting has been influenced by a

combination thereof; or (b) he is insane.

Second, NOSENKO lied about himself in order to

Bave

face.

Third, NOSEIKO has misrepresented himself, either

on his own

or at the instigation. of the KGB.

Each of these mutually exclusive alternatives is discussed

below.

2. First Alternative

According to one postulate, NOSElYU was an officer in

the KGB but has a faulty memory,

has a selective memory.

and/or has embellished or boasted:

a. Faulty Memory

NOSENKO himself has repeatedly appealed for understanding

that "different pecple have different memories"

and that

his own is "funny,"

and this is supported by hig forgetful-

ness and errors concerning events he is known indesendently

to have lived through, such as

the BURGI and athl cases.

But it

cannot be gaid that he is, in general.

"very bad with

names " because he nas almost total recall of names and

positions of hundreds of KGB officers in the merican and

Tourist Departments•

He has a good memory for leces and

rarely failed to recognize photographs of people he claimed

to know.

He remembered consistently details about certain

operations (the compromise and investigation of PENKOVSKIY,

the surveillance of ABIDIAN to Pushkin Street, the JENNER:

case, the arrest of BARGHOORN, and the search for CHEREPANOV,

to cite a

few examples).

NOSENKO was precisely accurate in

his recollection of

most of his dealings with CIA personnel

from June 1962 onward.

b. Selective Memory

Although having a selective nemory is probably true of

nearly everyone, a CIA psychologist has described NOSENKO as

a psychopath who would register each passing event only in

relation to its effect on himielf at that moment.

This

would inevitably make him indifferent to the characteristics

of other people, for example, and to the

sequence in which

events transpired; the aspects important to him might rot

appear so to a more objective observer. Such a person would

> SECRET,

---

## Page 160

760₽

suppress unpleasant memories and would have no real appro

clation of or respoct for an "objective truth."

His re-

porting, like his perception and his memory, might therefore

seen distorted.

He right recount events according to bie

mood of the moment.

Thus, fo example, 1f real attachrents

to family or friends da Irpossible for a psychopath, there

be an explanation as to why NOSENKO cannot easily remember

his childrens' birthdays, why in 1962 (or 1965) he appears

to have lled-or been indifferent to the truth about hig

older daughter's schooling, and why he cannot recall when

be first married.

In theory this bypothesis can explain

any aberration, sinco it involves the unknowable.

most extreme form, by describing NOSENKO as one unable to

discriminate

between fact and fancy, it would encompass and

explain away

the facts that his story is obviously untrue

and contradictory in

major ways; that his account of his

personal and professional life and his rendition of the.

information he knows are so vague and unsubstantial; that

be cannot (and/or does not care to) remenber or recount

how he did the things he did.

Most important, it would

disniss any conclusions based on NOSENKO's testimony siace

nothing NOSENKO said

could be taken seriously.

This hypo-

thesis

however, is unsupportable because of several

factors.

First, NOSENKO claims

that

he quickly rose to high supervisory

responsibility in a

counterintelligence organization which

is known to require

attention to detail.

He would have risen in the KGB while

overcoming the black marks in his file:

scandal, indiscip-

line,

negative background factors, and bad Party

record.

NOSENKO

admits that his performance was not good; he was

inattentive and inactive and almost none of his

operational

activity was carried

out unaccompanied.

That his rise re

sulted from his father's influence or GRIBANOV's is unten

able, for his father died in 1956 and GRIBANOV's patronage

(itself open to the strongest doubt) would not and could not

be dispensed upon such a mental case.

Mental aberration to

the degree which would explain his poor performance under

CIA interrogation would necessarily have hindered his per

formance of KGB duties, denied him special privileges, and

and hence cost him the carcer which NOSENKO has claimed for

himself.

A second factor negating this hypothesis of a psycho-

pathic personality is that such a person could be induced

to recall certain details

with the help of discussion,

questioning, and reminders, whereas NOSENKO's vague and hazy

reports seem to represent the absolute limits of his memory

or knowledge.

Years of questioning have not succeeded in

dredging up any new details or incidents.

when reminded,

be could not recall, for example, one of KOSOLAPOV'S IDYs to

Helsinki, the details of the seizure of electronic equipment

from the U.S. Army Attaches at Stalingrad, the correct date

of GOLITSYN's defection, or the presence

of KHRUSHCHEY ID

Moscow at the time of the decision to arrest BARGHOORN.

Another factor is the impossibility of applying this

hypothesis to the totality of NOSENKO's reporting.

hypothests holds that some things are important to him and

are not,

and that he therefore remenhers the former

and forgets the latter, it 15 refuted by the inability to

TOP SECRET

## Page 161

761•

find a catogory of information about himself which he con

fistently remembered nor has that he consistently forgot.

if what is important is his con direct experiences,

for

example, it is odd that he recitled the operations of others

better than his on; he remembered the dames of hundreds of

KGB officers,

but could not recall nanes of his own agents

and people

involved in his own carrer; he could recount

details of the PENNOVSKIY Investigation, in which he did

not participate, but not of the discovery of American spies

among tourists, such

as MCGOWAY, for which he was responsible;

be remembered details of the 1953 MALIA case in which he

did not meet the target personally but forgot details of the

1961 KEYSERS case in which he did. If it is the importance

to him of recruitment operations against U.S. Embassy em-

ployees which permitted him to recall some details of the

STORSBERG and MULE operations, it is not leportant enough

to help hin recall some of the other details which were

equally pertinent to nim personally; and it is not selective

memory which made hin forget almost every detail about CIA

selectio

personnel in Moscow and KCB action against them.

If it is

said that his parental famiiy is importart to him ( hence

his memory of his father's funeral and the names of his

urcles and aunts), it is odd that he cannot recall details

about his childhood.

If drinking with important people is

meaningful to him, it would explain why he remembers one

GRIBANOV evening with sharp clarity, but it does not explain

why he cannot remember the other two times, not even

in what

scason of the year or in what restaurant they took place.

Finally, with reference to the "selective menory" bypo-

thesis, it is precisely in natters NOSENKO

said he remenbers

best and which be told most confidently that the majority of.

inexplicable contradictions arise.

Nothing could shake him

from his claim to have been directly responsible for ABiDIAN

or on his story of the Pushkin Street dead drop, among

numerous exanples.

c. Embellishment

The third possibility is that he has simply embellished

and boasted, while underlying his story

is a core of truth

somewhere near

what he has reported.

NOSENKO has, after all,

admitted many "white lies" and boasts ("painting"

binself, as

he called it). Also, in the interrogations there were

repeated signs that he was fabricating and improvising, often

in ways which led bim into more contradictions and further

admissions of white lies.

Perhaps then, according to this

hypothesis, he simply invented, on his on, various aspects

of his career.

Perhaps he dated his entry

into the KGB

earlier to make himself seen more experienced,

and invented

his service in the American Department to make himself more

interesting to American Intelligence. Perhaps he was only

a principal agent, not a staff officer, but learned enough

from his operations and

fron his handlers to think be could

pose as one.

This hypothesis would certainly explain sany

of the dubious aspects:

the story of his career, bis lack

of information

KGB staff procedures, his ignorance of

major KGB events and scurces, the degree of his relationship

with GRIBANOV, etc.

This theory, however, founders on a

number of points:

• TOP SECRET

The only other postulate is that NOSENKO is not what

he claims to be,

in which case his misrepresentation

done either on his own or as part of a KGB operation.

If he is uisrepresenting hirself on his own, there are

in theory) only two possibilities:

He Is ecrols exag

gerating (discussed above, under the "First Alternative") or

he is a fabricator®

He cannot be a fabricator, however, since

the Soviets have cortified him in many ways; includirg his

diplonatic status at the Goneva Conference, Soviet o*ficial

protests and Sorict Embassy confrontation

in Washington,

Soviet officials' roaris in various ereas of the

world, and

Tor his KGB status and

Inportance.

764.

There remains the possibility that NOSENKO has misrep-

resented himself and is a witting part of a KGB operation.

This

hypothesis could accormodate the argument that the KGB would

not dispatch. a KGB staff officer as a double agert against a

hostile service because, whether or not the argument is valid.

NOSENKO (as indicated in Part VIII.D. above) has not proven his

clain to having

served as an officer of the KGS. If he has

been and is now under iGB control, it would cypear that he was

being built up

for years to look like an officer and was shown

to lesterners in certain recruitment oferationg.*

This could

explain NOSENKO's revelations to FRIPPEL and others about his

family and background; the otherwise pointless W.E. JOHNSON

case, and NOSENKO's appearance in

the BARGHOORN interrogation.

It could explain NOStliKo's uneven memory

and performance under

detailed questionirg: Much of what he should have known by

personal experience

could have been mercly memorized as part

of his KGB briefing.

Nothing in NOSEN:O's production (see

Part VIII.B.

would preclude his being a KGS-dispatched

agent.

That he was a KGB-dispatched agent was the conclusion

independently arrived

at by the CIs specialist who administered

examination to NCSENKO in April 196%.

4. Remarks

The first alterrative above has been rejecied while the

possibility that HOSE:KO or. his own misrepresented himself

is unacceptable.

The remaining possibility is that NOSENKO

has been manipulated by the iG9 in an operation directed

against American Intelligence.

His American

Department service in 1960-1961 was not supported

by any such "show"

appearances--he did not insist on the

truth of his claim to participation in the KEYSERS case:

2. Resume and Discussion of Infcimation*

American Department - 1953

NUSIZIKO has said that he entered the KGB in jarch 1953**

and was first assigned to the U.S. Embaasy Section of the American

Department of whit

1g now the Second Chief Directorate, KGB. He

steted that his duttes from 113 entry until sometime in 1954, por-

haps about June, were to work on files of inerican correspondents

on permanent assignment to "oscod and to meet with the soviet

citizens who were agents of informants reporting on the corres-

pondents to the koB.

COLIISY stated that he met NOSENKO ir the imerican Depart-

ment of the Internal Counterintelligence Directorate*** a couple

of times in 1753 when he, CULITSYN, was there on other matters.

GOLITSAY had earlier identified his own job between Becember

1952 and April 1953 as Chief of the imerican Sector, Counter-

intelligence (Ninth) Department, Foreign Directorate, under the

Chief Intelligence Directorate (formed in December 1952 and re-

organized in April 1953). From April 1953 until his departure

for Vienna in Uctober 1953 Gullaini was Deputy chief of the

Emigre jector, Counterintollioner department, torelgn Intelligene:

Dopartment, Foreign Intelligence Directorate. CULITSYN has not

indicated the nature of his rosponsibilities in either of these

positions which would have necessitsted his visiting the American

Department of the Internal Counterintelligence Directorate, although

certain activities of cormon interest with the latter would appear

logical. NUSEKO's description of his alleged duties with corres-

pondents, however, did not encompass his having official contacts

with representatives of any component of the Courterintelligence

departrent of the foreign Directorate. According to HOSENKO'e

description of the location of his claimed office in the irerican

Department, and his description of the duties of the co-worrers

he said shared it with lin, chance contacts there with such a

representative would have been precluded. Even by NOSENKOg account.

then, an encounter between GOLITSYN and himself could not have

been in the course of interdepartmental liaison between their

respective units, nor could it have occurred in MOSSiO's office.

GOLITSY's lack of reporting on KCB operations against American

• correspondents (other than his conversation with KOVSHUK in 1956

or 1957 about Henry SHAPIRO) is further evidence that his business

In the Merican Department was unrelated to NOSENKO"s claimed

activities at that time, and GOLITSYN's on staterent on the 1953

encounters implied that his meetings with MOJENKO were accidental.

Fleeting as their contacts would therefore have been, it could

have led GULITSIN to make the unfounded assumption that NOSENKO

was a member of the staff within the anerican Department.

imerican Lepartment/Tourist separtment - 1955-1960

NOSENKO stated that he transferred from the American Depart

ment to the tourfat Department in June 1955, and remained in the

Touriat Departmant until 1960, becoming a deputy chief of section

there in 1958.

GOLITSAl, however, insisted that NOSDIKO remained in the

American Department until at feast 1957, or possibly as late aa

1958.

3. Comment's On GOLITSYN

Several factors influence the evaluation of COLlIST's Etatea

ments on rosenio!

- First, as stotal in Part VIII.I.. It 15 concluded

that NOSENKO did not serve in the diGa positions ho elaimed.

COLITSY!!'s testimony verified this conclusion Insofar as

NOSEIKO's claims about service in the U.5. Embassy Section

of the American Department in 1960-1961 are concerned liore-

over. In 1962 COLlISIll concluded that the KGB "letter-writer"

(actually NOSENKO) was under XGa control in subaltting infor-

mation to imerican Intelligence. At issue, therefore, 19 the

evidence from COLITSYN to the effect that lOSENKO was an

officer in the imerican Department (until 1357 or 1958, Whereas

3. Parallels with liOSENKO's Reporting

a. The CHEREPAVOV Case

(1) Sunmary

One of the two ways

in which

on the authenticity of ClEREPANOV

has corroborated NOSENKO

as a geruine solice of American

Intelligerce has to cite information

0344-027

CHERESANON

torrorly served in

the KGB: CHEREPAHOV

cave

some papers to the U.S. Embassy in Mosco.

which returned them to che Soriet Minisery of Foreign Mifairs

(MFA).; the MFA turned the papers over to the iGB, which traced

them by analysis to CHEREPANOV: nearinnile, CHEREFANOV had tried

to flee the USSR, but he was captured near the Turkisi border and

executed.

In every major respect, therefore @elE agrees with

NOSEiKO's version of the case.

When asked whether the CHEREPANOV

incident might

have been

"a trick" by the kGS to encarrass the

U.S. Embassy,

replied that it was definitely not.

The second way in whiche

ax mont has certified that CHER SPANOV

was a genuine source is ircirect.

Like NOSAKO and enorof the

CHEREPANOV documents, Walter had indicated that KGB sury: llance

of a U.S. Embassy officer brought about the compromise of POFOV.
