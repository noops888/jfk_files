18 sas remarkad, appears to be largely the came as the old E'RD budgot.

All prosent foit that thie budgot appeared to be well-padded and largely

for salaries. R. was remarked by Colonel Johnson that there seemed

2, Ms. Coors saloed the question of what was the cover to bo

uned by Colonel Johnson In his contacts with Dr. MIRO. Colonel Johnson

sald that the covor question had not yet been renolved, that it was

questionable how long any cover would hold up, particularly with the

press, that the covor of publie relationa consultant, the cover of a

research man of teacher in Mlaml, and various other possibilities were

under consideration.

Mr. Coere commented that the setute press repo

resentatives might soon learn the Identity of the ClA representalive

With MIRO, particularly ll opposition leadere like PRIC, wbo, he re-

masked, already seems to know, ehould become angry and report in

the preas what hoy know. Mr. Hurwitch stated that MIRC had told him

tha: PRIO, or a sepresentative ol PRIO, had sald to MIRC, "I under-

Mr.

dald that there was noed so clarify Juas who

Colonel Jobneon represented to Dr. MIRO, that MIRO had beon sold

ho would have a ropresentative who would havo froquent contact with

Mr. Goodwin in the White Hound and Mir. Voodward and others at

the Department of State and would aloo be in contact with the Agency.

and that it was accordingly the understanding of the Agency Shat

Colonel Johnson would therefore represent or be the list between

Dr. MIRO and the U. S, Government, at least in the Miami area.

He romarked that thie certainly had some bearing on the cover matter

and ita socurity nepocta. Me. Coers remarked that it seemed

Colonel Johnson was simply an overt representative of the Agency.

M8.

remarked that this was hardly possible and etill bave

any security or dentability. Il he was overt, he was automatically

a reprosentative of the U. S. Governmont. Mr. Hurwitch Interposed

that be comsidered Colonal Johneon to be solely the representative of

the Agency.. Ho nald that Mr. Goodwin had aald that be, Goodwin,

only wanted to be consulted on tha most Important lenues and that MIRO's

normal contact in Washington for policy guidance should be with the

Cuban dook in the Department of State. la Mlaml, Colonal Jobason

would then work our with MIRO the Agancy support of these policiee.

Mr. Hurwitch continued, expressing his view that

Colonel Johnson should have the authority from the Agency to diocues

and approve Dr. MIRO's operational plane ouch as tours to Lalia

Ameriça, support of laternal gruups and the like and, lí certain plana

wore approvod by them, to ait down with MIRO, the military advleore

and reprosentalives of the Intornal groups, and work out final details

for actually running operatione in support of there elemento.

Nás.

counterod, "It de by no means as simple as that.

This

le a lot more complicated than just having two or a dosen peoplo sit

down in Miaml and agree on something. Take, for Instance, the

simple matter, relatively speaking, of sending to Latin America a

persos on a speaking tour.

Did you know that the Immigration and

Nasuralisation Service and the FIl require all requests for support

from them to be sent back here to Washington and then their poople

In Miard have to be Instructed by their Headquarters here in Washing-

ton to facilitate such traval, thus, in effect, the final control on travel

le up here Ia Washington and it doesn't oven reside in the Arancy.

Each individual has to bo so handled." Mr. Hurwitch said be thought

that this could do worked out ao that ll could be done entirely locally

In Miami. Mr.

expressed some doubt and said that somehow

he had the impression that MIRO had little assete but thought that

Il ho could acquire all the facilitica of ClA an a governmont ontity

placod at hia disposal, he could do something. Of course these

facilities and the authority of ClA simply could not be turned over to

Dr. MINO.

3.. Colonel Johnson sald that be felt there was a considerable

area in which we could support Dr. MIRC and he referred to the

Stato Department'a propaganda plan, "Operacion Griota, " which

Dr. MIRO wald he had recelved during hid visit to Mr. Hurwitch and

Mr. Morales Carrion. Mr, Hurwitch explained that this was in no

senso & Department of Stars plan but rather a suggested draft by

Moralea Carrion and passod to MIRO ao meroly an indication el the

Dors of propaganda oporation in Lalin America that mighi be elloctive.

6. On the subject of propaganda and the activitlos of the

"collateral groups" like the FORD, the DRE, ole, outaldo the CRC.

both Mr. Wollim and Mr. Hurlich sald they bolleved it would be

possible to transfer these groups and thoir activities in thair entiresy

to DI. MIRO In accordance with his desires.

Mr. L

bald

he sympathized with MIRO's position kut doubted that lt would work.

is. Hurwitch aald that if we had some doubts on thie matter, he won-

dared why theas doubta had not been brought up by Mr. Blosell in the

discussions with Mr. Goodwin. Mr. Hurwitch then elalmed he had a

Coodwin memo saying tho DRE, FORD, and all Internal groupe must

Do financed through MIRG. M?. Hurwiich wondered when thin new

position had developed in the Agency. Mr.

stated that tho

Agency had bad long experience durlog the past tin years in dealing

with the various Cuban elemente both in and outaide Cuba, and that

these types of probleme had exiated from the beginning and although

lhoy may seem new to Mr. Hurwitch and Me. Wollam, who had recent-

ly come on the desk, they cortalnly were not new to Mir. Coerr, who

readily agreed. Ir. I

pointed out that, In the early stages of

1960, attempta were made to form vome sort of coalition of the

miscollaneous Cuban groups. Elsally the FRD was burn and much

Ister the CRC, responsibilily for wilch was then transferred to the

White House and the State Department after the Invasion, In the firat

form miocellaneous groupe, political and collateral, and then try to

shove thorn one way or the other under the umbrella of the FRD.

He pointed our that the most telling criticloin made by the prees and

by mombers of the State Department, 10o, at that time was that

wa were forcing those vatlous groups through monetary control into

Joining the FRI: He elated furthor that this had been diocussed la

Dalimore last month in dötall with Ds. MIRO, who at that time

mooned to agree that ll Dr. MIRO and the CRC were to succeed in

controlling the other groupe, both collateral and political, is Ideally

should be by leadership rather than by exorcising linnacial control.

т.

Mr.

then brought up the quastion of just how far

should we go in oupport of MIRO and the Council, and how are we going

8o justily some of these expenses. Considerable discusalon followed,

at the conclusion of which Mr.

said he would ilke to throw out

on the table some specifie pointo simply so an indication al somo ol...

the problem areas which he felt had been at lose! touched upon by tho

docussion and to which in the coming woeke come consideration would

bavo to be givon, although certally this meeting should not try to :

arrivo it any dolinitive answero:

It should be clarified whethor-or nut, in fact, sorne of

those persona lioted as receiving salaried fron the FRD are aleo re-

colving economie ald from the HEW.

D. Is should bo noted that Dr. MIRO's requeet to engago in

activitloo are somotired very unrealistice. For example, at one point

Dr. MIRO wanted to lake over the Swan leland operation and wanted

to pul up a $2, 000, 000 raddo atstion al Koy leat to beam propaganda

to Cuba and'álso to Jam Cuban broadcaote.

The proposal to have round table discussions including

DE. MIRO, his military commisalon, and representalives of the internal

groups to decide on sabotage and commando-lypo raído is rather un-

realistie for a variety of reasone, Including security factora and the

question of whether or not thie would be accoptable to any or all of

the Internal groups.

d. De. MIRO has apparenily the idoa that ho can use his

million dollars for whatever he desires with little or no advance sp

proval, and above thia figure he may ask for unlimited funde for

operatione. This area certainly needs clearing up.

stared that ho had discused this

matter very thoroughly with Ur. MIRO, and it appeared from that

convorsation that MikO had had only one indirect contact with this

group.

Dr. MIRO had merely a plece of paper eignod by RAMIREZ

and soveral othoro allogodly in the Escambray, staling that there

were doino 30 of them in desperate straite and in nood of support and

that, If weapons were aiven to thom, they could mueter 100.

Dr. MIRO was at lhat point not even sure how the paper had got to

him and had no means whatsooves of communicating with RAMIREZ.

Ho proposed the une of a boat to get the suppllen to the North coast

of Craba, but had no Idoa how to got thom from the North coast to the

Iscombasy. As an alternative, he suggeated an ale drop by a plano

from Florida.

With regard to the financial ald that MIRO had epokea

to both Mr. Hurwitch and Colonel Johnaon about, 1.0., the $70, 000

monthly to be sent into Caba vla tho
