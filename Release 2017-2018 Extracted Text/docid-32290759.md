THEIR NAMES, AND FRIENDS OF ALEX AND OTHER CHICAGO HOODLUMS,

KRUSE AS WELL AS ALEX, MAY HAVE A FINANCIAL INTEREST IN

THESE TWO AUTO AGENCIES.

INFORMANT ADVISED THAT BOTH EPSTEEN AND SUSK WERE

LOOKING FOR A FIX IN THE STATE AUDITOR'S OR A CONTACT WHICH

AMOUNT OF SALES TAX FORWARDED THE STATE OF ILLINOIS IN

CONNECTION WITH THEIR NEW CAR SALES. INFORMANT SAID THAT IN

ORDER FOR THEM TO OPERATE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME, THEY WOULD

HAVE TO MAKE A CONTACT IN THE ILLINOIS REVENUE DEPARTMENT AND

PUT IN A FIX WITH EITHER TED ISSACS,
