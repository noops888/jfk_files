RE: ALDO VERA SERAFIN

On November 11, 1963, Aldo Vera Serafin, 1382 North-

west 34th Street, Miami, advised that about three weeks ago

Sierra left Miami for Chicago; he has not seen him since that

time and it is unknown if Sierra has returned to Miami.

Vera said Sierra wanted to participate in sowe

military action against Cuba, the "Soresma" was going to be used

as a mother ship for attack boats, but Sierra ran out of money

and Aguilar's boat was confiscated. Vera stated his organization

has no plans to engage in any raids, sabotage or infiltration

missions against Cuba at the present time.
