Asses nation of President Kennedy--Reported

Anoaymous Telephone Message

The following cable fron the CIA Station in London was reported

orally to Mr. Samuel Papich at 0930 on 23 November:

The British Security Service (MI-5) has reported that at

1805 GMI On 22 November an anonymous telephone call was made in

Cambridge, England, to the senior reporter of the Cambridge News.

caller said only that the Cambridge News reporter should call the

American Embassy in London for some big news and then hung up. S

3. After the word of the President's death was received the re-

porter informed the Cambridge police of the anonymous call and the

police inforned MI-S. The Important point is that the call was made,

accordirg to MI-5 calculations, about 25 minutes before the President

was shot. The Cambridge reporter had never received a call of this

kind before and MI-5 state that he 1s known to them as a sound and loyal /

person with no security record. S

MI-5 noted that similar anonymous phone calls of a strangely

coincidental nature have been received by persons in the U. K. over the

past year, particularly. In connection with the case of Dr. Ward. S

The British Security Service stated its desire to assist in

every possible way on any follow-up Investigations required within

the United Kingdom.
