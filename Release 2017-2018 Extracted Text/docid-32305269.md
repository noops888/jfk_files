For the information of the Bureau, 201 535-S

has advised HERMINIO DIAZ is cesponsible for saving

the Life of My 635-S.

This occurred a number of

yaers ago, while MM 635-S was seiving In the Cubar.

evolutionary Police (while still an active informant

DiE thi office, ai which time DiAZ notified MM 635-S he was

to be idled up and arrested on the following day on a

chaige of counterrevolutionary activities.

MM 635-S

went into hiding immeciately and on the following day

Cuban investigators came to his residence in Havana,

seeking him. After remaining in hiding several months,

MM 635-S escaped to the U.S.

Ic is felt that an incerview at this particular

time of HERMINIO DIAz by this office might possibly

jeopardize the security of MM 535-S and as the same time

would accompiish little specific resulis concerning the

immediate plans of DiAz, who is believed unlikely to

divulge information which might shwart his own plans.

MM 635-S has been instructed to continue to

mairtain contact with DIAz, Wheneves possible, in an

attempt to obtain more specific facts. The Miami Office

will keep the Bureau advised of any further pertinent

developments.
