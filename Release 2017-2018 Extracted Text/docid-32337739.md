show that Pedro Luis Gutierrez sought asylum in the Dominican Republic

during 1933, returned so Cuba in 1936, and again took asylun in the

Dominican Republic in September, 1944.

It is known that he latex

returned to Cuba but our files do not indicate when.

One of oux sources who formerly worked closely with

Pedro Luis Cutlercez has received information Indicating that as of

May, 1963, Gutierrez was a lieutenant in the Department of Information

Of the Cuban G-2 and that his wife was at that time a member of the

Cuben Militia.

In view of the foregoing, It la suggested charledro luis

Gutierrer night possibly be identioal with "albarto " Cy ll)

NOTE:

Classified "Secret" since information from a previous

CIA letter so classified is repeated herein and since we refer

to specific activities in a foreign country of one of our

representatives.

CIA has brought a defected Cuban official from

Brazil to the U. S. and he has been attempting to give CIA the

exact picture of the Cuban intelligence organization as it exists

under Castro.

He described "Alberto" as a key intelligence

official and said employees under "Alberto" did not know is true

name but knew him as the person who claimed to have been responsible

fos the erraat of a Garan master spy in Hevena during 1942. (lU)

Section Chief D. J. Brennan recalled Luning's identity

and review of his file shows that SA Edwin L. Sweet of Miami

Office and MM 492-S, who was then a high Cuben Police official,

were responsible for

tuning' starrest and they also obtained a

full confession from Luning.

Checks with SA Sweet and MM 492-S

show Gutierrez was present at the arrest and MM 492-S, who served

as Gutierrez's superior for many years,.

now believes Gutierrer

was a fanatical communist throughout their association.
