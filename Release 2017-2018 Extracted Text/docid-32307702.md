is associated with some members of the MIRR, reported

that BOSCH had recently contacted DI. DENTO/ONSICA and

GUILLERMO MORAZES, leaders of the MOVIMIENIO REVOLUCION-

ARIO FRANK PAIS (MRFP), an anti-CASTRO group of Cuban

exiles in Miaml. He appealed to them to support an

MIRR plan to picket in Miami as a protest against the

arrest and prosecution of JOSE RODRIGUES PERIS. BOCh

commit the MRFP because such action might be interpreted

as a protest against the United States government, and

the MRFP did not want to become involved in such acti-

vity. They pointed out to BOSCH that the guilt or inno-

court. They also advised BOSCH to forget about the

picketing since he is in enough trouble already.

On January 18, 1966, MM T-3, a former Cuban

It was observed this

picketing did occur as planned during the morning and

afternoon at the courthouse.

About 50 Cubans partici-

bond and ordered him returned to Puerto Rico for trial.

On January 13, 1966, MM I-2 advised that BOSCH

and MARCELINO GARCIA disclosed that they were going to

attempt to form a unity of Cuban exile groups.

BOSCH

explained that this would make it more difficult for
