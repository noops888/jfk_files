Head of

as d

Rand Disability System

1.

As you may

know, we are in the proced

reviewing the employment

history and

current carcer field of all employees in the Agency to identify

those who are eligible

for designation as a participant in the new CIA

Retirement and Disability System.

In this process, che initial review of

each case lo made by the indiridual's Career Service, If. the Head of hle

Career Service nominates him for participation in the System, this nomina

tion da reviewed by the ClA freirement Board ahich recommends final action

to me. However, If the Head t

the Career Service aduises that the employee

does not meet the basic

requirtments of HR 20-50 for participation,

I have

accepted this finding withoug further review by the lA Retirement Board.

This practice has been adopte: in the interest of expediting this screening

process so chat those employces ano are eligible to participate in the Syg

tem may be designated participants as soon as possible.

2, In your case, the Hesi of your Career Service has advised me that

you do not meet the requiremen's of HR 20-50 for designation as a particl

pant and I have accordingly mair the formal determination required by the

regulation chat you are not eligible for designation.

From a revlew of your

record it appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon

che fact chat you have 15 jears or more of Agency service, but have not as

yet performed 60 months of qualifying service as required by regulation. My

determination that you are not eligible at this time for designation in no

way affects your current status under the Civil Service Retirement System,

nor does it preclude reconsideration of your eligibility

to participate in

the ClA System if you should met the requirements for designation in the

future.

3.

Should you desire

further information concerning the requirements

for designation

as a participare in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that

you read paragraph. e of HR 20-30 and paragraph 5 of the Employee Bulletin

dated 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Law 88-643. The Central Intelligence

Agency Retirement Act of 1904 for Certain Emplovees."

4.

It is always possible that the records upon which the determination

made in your case may have bore incomplete or inaccurate regarding your actual

employment history with the forney.

If, after studying the matertals cited

above, you have questions regarding the determination that you are not el gi-

ble to participate in the

CiA frtirement System, please feel free to contact

officials of your Career

They are familiar with the details of your

case and will gladly discuss them with you.

In addition, you may wish to die-

cuss your case with

the ClA frsirement Stal: located in Room 205, Magazine

Building (extension 2847).

18 such discussions do not resolve any questions

you have regarding your eligilility, you may request that your case be formally

considered by the ClA Retiren at Board.

Hostver, this request must be made wich-

in 30 days of the

date of this nemorandum.

SUBJECT:

Reference to your memorandum concerning return to duty of Subject

sometime prior to 1 December 1951, this office will endeavor to comply

with your proposals. I might say that_

Jhas done a supertor job

as Alien Affairs Officer fur the Agency. There has been some thought

given to transferring the Alien Affairs Branch from I&S to the immediate

office of Mr. Dulles, and it is impossible to give a positive guarantee of

his availability, which in that case would be dependent upon Mr. Dulles'

decision.

Ifeel, however, that OSO could at least tentatively plan along the

line of your proposal.

The cooperation of the ADSO and Chief, FDT, in

making

Tavailable has been sincerely appreciated.
