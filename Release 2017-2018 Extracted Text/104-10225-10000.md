debate boorite

The following in from a dispaich written dy Mr. William Tylor, dated

22 June 1953.

1. After a recent conversation with Jean Paul David, al which time he

outlined hle activities and ideas in connoction with the mission with which

ho la charged by Georgos Bidaull, I received a lettor from him.

2. It will be seon from this letter that David is most anxioua that the

roport which he will nake on his curvey should reprosent, without committing

any one country, a syaliosia of the viawa and the resourced of the Western

powora allied under NATO, in the broad field of propaganda and paychological

warfare designod to build support for Vestern defenso policy and to promote

she achlevemen of te objoclives of these policies.

3. It occura to me tial a difficulty which we have to face, and which we

are probably unique in karing to face, is due so the organisational otructure

within which we oporate officially in the general field under diocuasion. In

a country like Ilaly, lor axample, il is possible for David to have exchangea

of views with high officials of the government and to foel reasonably suro

that even though such riems are not to be laten ad a commitment, they do in fact

represent the disposition of the governmeat in question, or any goverament

likaly to succeed it, toward these problems. In our case, homover, lt seemo

to me that it will reguiro careful preparation to determine with whom David

should consule and lo work out a conatructive position which will influence

his report and his recommendations in a direction which we approve.

4. It is particularly difficull for mo to make specific recommendations,

since devolopmenta iu f'ashingion in the last few months ara difficult to

keep up with from oversoad. I would, therefore, be particularly helpful

to have headquarters' viowa at this stage on the following points, assuming

that David will go to the States in late September os the last leg of his survey:

a. With whoin should he meet for badc discussions. (I occura to

me that a suitable body. il at ill in exiatonce, would so the Peychological

Operationa Coordinating Committee.)

b. Within mhai limita al this time aro me prepared to discusa the

problem of concerted action for the psychological strength of the North

Atlantic Community.

3. As beadquarters is aware, C. D. Jackson knows David personally,

and it would perhapa be uselul to arrange for conversations with him and

any group ho might have in mind. It is true that the position of David

in anomalous, since the curvey on which be le

engaged,

is of the most official

Memorandum for the Record

Subject:

Conversation with Congressman Kerates

1. On 6 May Congresamon Korsten addressed a letter to the

Stale Department, enclosing a letter dared d May 1959, which he had

received from Mr. Creighton Scott, a former employee of Radi, Free

Europe al Munich, Germany.

This letter was highly critical of cer-

tain personnel in RFE, particularly as regarde allegations of pro-com-

munist attitudes. On 6 July I discussed these criticisms with Cungress-

man Keraten in detail, conveying lo him orally the materinl contained

in the memorandum of 17 June 1953 from the Director of Security; Subject:

Inquiry by Cungressman Keraten; which the Director ol Security had noted

should be utilired in this meeting with Congressinan Kersten.

2. The Congreseman noted the difficulty in evaluating the sype of

criticiams which dr. seott hod made but appeared willing so accept our

explanation.

3. Cungresenian

defaten then turned do certain crincisins which

he had heard expressed regarding RFI: from several sources, including

Scull. One such erilielsm ia that AFE is nt doing the best it sbould on

religious programs.

He feela that this aspect uf the broadcasts sould

probably be considerably strengthened, particularly amung Catholic

elements.

4. Mr. Kersien cited the opinion of Count Tarnuwski (sp. ?). a well

known Pole, who told le Congressman that any fourteen year old Suriet

citizen would be as well briefed on Soviet philosophy as lu bara up their

nosea at the RFF material. The Count (and fersion appears to agree)

feels loal le Soviel population has more sophisticaied philosophical

material thrown at them by their own Government, and that it should be an.

important function of RFt: lo counter with an allept to destros the Soviet

philosophical material and shake the Soviet faith in their theoreticians.

Congreasman Keraten realized that it is difficult to capture a

wide audience wilh philosophical arguinents, but he feels that if these

arguments reached a segment of important leaders behind the Iron Curtain,

it would help so destroy and counter the philosophica! teachings of Mars,

Lenio, et al. The Cungressmen feels that many of vur broadcasts deal

with econimie inaliers, and, while these are important, AFE should go

Secu

## Page 275

deeper and hit harder on religion and philosophy.

6. While Cungresoman Kersten is aware that many of the

captive population are not interested in righteal movementa. it do

bia opinion that RFE cannot beat communiam with aocialiam. In

particular, he lelt (and Scott bore this out in their conversation)

that we were making for much use of Czech socialiate, and we were

using sociallets from the Eence Government which had sought tu

compromise with the communisto.

While be recognizes the popu

larity of Benca and Masary In Czechia, he feels they are not el-

lective in Slovakia, where there is a hoavy Catholic pupulation.

7.

Congressman Yersten plans to go to Europe, probably

in September.

While he did not say su, l belleve he would welcome

an invitation to vialt RFE, Munich,

Furthermore, do the author of

the Keraten Amendment and uf several resoluttons on the enslaved

peoples; at leadt one of which may receive Congressional approval

at this session, conalderation sight be given as to whether it would

be advisable lo request the Congressman lo

utilize RFE facilities

lo broadcast while he la abrad.

1957 CALPALON

Tho 1951 Crusade Campaign was begun by the launching uf balloons into

Csechoalovakia and Poland containing pamphlets of ericouragement to the peoplo

i these countries. Copies of the message and samples of the balloong were

used to aoliale contributiins in the United States. Publloity doalt largoly

with Radio Frue Europe. Free magazine advertising was widoly used for the

first time. A coast to coast telethon was used.

Inadvurtently, through mistakes of the stalf and the fallure to adequately

brief comunity leadors, the Crusade mistakenly laplled that the Volce of

Amertoa was Ineffective - that only Radio Free

trope, the privatoly supported

radio broadosating statlon, could do an effeative job.
