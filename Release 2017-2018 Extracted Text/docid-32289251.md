The following contacts have been made in

On February 27, 1958, GEORGE HIRSCHEL, the

garage attendant who works

days at the garage where the

subject keeps cars which he uses, advised that "RYAN",

the alias used by ALEX at his residence, does not keep

his car in the garage where HIRSCHEL works (at subject's

there, HIRSCHEL would not advise about it.

He was

very belligerent and non-cooperative.

subject's residence, 4300

However,

They continue

to point out that they are not in a position to know

of ALEX's comings or goings, his activities, his

associates, or anything else which may be of assistance

The only information they havé ever

furnished has been that ALEX, as RYAN, continues to pay

rent for an apartment there.

When ALEX was being sought

by this office as a missing witness of the Senate

Rackets Committee, they advised only that someone,

unknown to them and in their absence, paid ALEX's rent

every month by dropping cash in an envelope on their

desk.

They have advised that they are unable to find

ALEXis application for the apartment which he executed

when he moved in.

They have also advised that they do

not know whether ALEX keeps a car in the garage stall

which he pays rent on. In summation, they profess

cooperation but have never gone out of their way to

obtain any information and it is suspected that they

could furnish more if so inclined.
