During the past year Mr. Christ has attempted to consolidate the large

arcas of responsibility in his Applied Physics Division which now encompasses

effort in positive audio surveillance, countermeasures, micropower and micro-

technology, und emplacement: He continues to be conscientious, responsive,

and aggressive in the management and development of these technical programs.

Further, during the past year giant strides have buen taken in the coordination

of many of these efforts with their eventual consumers. This coordination has

been above and beyond that required by existing Agency regulations.

Mis managerial talents encompass a wide range of activities and it must

be acknowledged that they are responsible in large measure for many of the

forward-looking, highly productive programs under his direction. On occasion

his enthusiasm for some of the Division efforts tends to lead to over-accelcration

in some cases where perhaps careful reassessment would be in order. However,

his generally cooperative and thoughtful exercise of initiative has resulted in

truly large steps forward in technical arcas where the cost effectiveness cannot

During the past year, Mr. Christ has expanded his responsibilities

for his Applied Physica Division, which now encompasses effort in positive

audiosurveillance, countermeasures, micropowcr-microldehnnlogs, and

emplacement problems.

He continues to be conscientious, responsive, and

aggressive in the management and development of the technical programs

linder his direction and supervision.

His managerial talents encompass a wide range of activities, and it

must be acknowledged that they are responsible, in large measure, for the

forward-looking, highly productive programs under his direction.

His cost consciousness is best exemplified by his detailed planning and

charting of cost, time, and technical details in a variety of complex areas.

He has taken the lead in solving many involved, detailed and intricate interface

and coordination problems with virtually all other technical groups within the

Agency.

I expect a high degree of intelligence pay-off as a result of programs

under his supervision.

growth problems of the Audio Physica IIvision, which encompasses effort in positive

audiosurveillance, countermeasures, and emplacement problems.

Mr. Christ continues to be conscientious, responsive, and alert to the needs of

the Agency in terms of the substantive content of technical programs under his direc

encompasses the recruiting, programming, coordination, and other factors necessary

to implement these programa in an offective manner. His coat-consciousness is a

continuing effort throughout the year and is best exemplified by his carful over all

planning and charting of total program efforts in order that projecte lead directly

to productive intelligence efforts.

Mr. Christ has had an unusually difficult position in one respect, in that his

technical surveillance effort was a major interface area with the DD/ I in a realm

where political and burcaucratic considerations could have deleteriously affected the

content of his programs. He handled these problema in a manner that was favorable

for the over-all good of the Agency in terms of technical progress in numerous areas

Nr. Christ has been under my direct supervision for about six months, during

a difficult period of growth, expansion, and change in the Office of Research and

Development. During the process of reorgnization of the Office, Mr. Christ has

emerged as acting group leader of both the Radio-Physics and Audio Physics arcas

of eifort, which comprise about 40% of the eifort in the Physical Sciences portion of

the Offico.

Considering his geographical location for the previous three jears, Mr. Christ.

has done a remarkable job in orgaitizing the Radio- Physics effort and in developing a

new effort in Audio-Physics which promises to be one of the major programs in the

Office. All of this required that he exercise considerable initiative and judgment in

the delegation of responsibility for existing projects and in the formulation and

organization of new projects with an extremely under-manned staff.

Mr. Christ was extremely imaginative, vigorous, enthusiastic, and responsive

in the performance of these difficult assignments, and demonstrated very clear

ability to manage programs and develop teamwork against these continuing and new

objectives. In the development of the organizations necessary to implement these

programs, Mr. Christ has demonstrated a high degrec of cost consciousness by.

organizing personnel of the two groups so that with a limited staff they could upcrate

in both programs, and by vigorously combing the country to locate the best contrac

tors to implement the program and to seek advace as to appropriate sources for such

procurement.

SUBJECT:

Deputy Director for Science and Technology

Recommendation for Quality Step Increase -

David Le Christ

1. It is recommended that Mr. David L. Christ, Chiet of the

Applied Physics Division, Office of Research and Development, be

granted a Quality Step Increase from GS-16, step 6, to GS-16, step 7.

2. Mr. Christ entored on cluty with the Agency on 16 November

1950. He transferred to OlD foom the DD/P as & GS-16 in September,

1963€

During the past four and one half years he has assumed

increasing responsibilities and kis expertly implemented and fulfilled

the objectives for which his Division was formed in the carly growth

period of the Office. Although he has porformed equally as well, and

perhaps better than, many of his equivalent Division chiefs within the

Office, the supergrade 'f. O. limitation within the Office has prevented

a raise other than the Legialative pay raises.

3u Mr. Christ is connidered to be a kes individual in OND.

His energy, initiative, and enthuniasm in developing concepts and

applying managerial talents make his services to this Orfice envaluable..

In particular, his development of audio surveillance,

micropower-

PERSONNEL QUALIFICATION QUESTIONNAIRE

LARAR

Middle

1. The Agency is currently revising the system for machine coding

employee qualifications, thereby permitting more complete and accurate

data on all personnel.

The new system will aid in implementing Agency

policies on promotion from within by facilitating the selection of personnel

with desired education and

experience for vacancies which may occur. It

is also expected that the new system will provide readily accessible statistica

for planning and management purposes.

The attached questionnaire is designed to cover adequately those

factors in which the Agency is interested.

Although the information is, in

a large measure,

already reilected in previous forms submitted by you, it

is felt that your time within the organization may enable you to emphasize

those qualifications pertinent to its needs. The questionnaire also serves

to bring your education and qualifications record up to date.

3. Your cooperation is requested in completing the questionnaire as

thoroughly and accurately as possible and returning it to your Administrative

Officer within the time allotted.
