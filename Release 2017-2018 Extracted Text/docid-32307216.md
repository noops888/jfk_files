Re:

EMANUEL

CELLER

N

Informant advised that he spoke to Representative

EMANUEL CELLER last week and asked him if the House Judiciary

Committee was pushing their inquiry into the Justice Department

methods of handling the HOFFA investigations.. CELLER told the

informant that he had no intention of conducting any inquiries

until after ROBERT KENNEDY leaves office as Attorney General.

The informant then said,

"If Kennedy is nominated and becomes

vice president, we probably will never get the hearings"

CELLER indicated that this would probably be true.

Informant also advised he was in Chicago when HOFFA

was discussing CELLER's committee with SIDNEY ZAGRI, legislative

representative of the Teamsters.

ZAGRI was attempting to

convince HOFFA that CELLER's committee would shortly commence

an inquiry into the Justice Department, but HOFFA cut him short

and indicated that this talk makes for publicity, but he knew,

infact,

that CELLER would not conduct any hearings as long

as KENNEDY was in a position to "hit back at Celler"
