in the Mitch Community north of Bogalusa. LEE is believed

to live in the Mitch Community and is a white male, 65 years

of age, 5' 10", 200 pounds with a florid complexion. LEE's

wife, whose first name is unknown, is also a member of the

women's auxiliary of the klan.

BILLY C. MORRIS, who is a member of the OKKKK is

in the procese of adopting a child and has allegedly made a

recent statement that for the next few months he is not going
