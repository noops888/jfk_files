PH 714-C* has been intermittent in the past and

is not now functioning at all.

In order for this source to be put back in

operation, it will be necessary to examine

the unit.

To insure more reliable performance without excessive

current drain, it is requested that it be replaced with a

transistorized unit as soon as possible.

The car can be made available at any time by

PH 614-C-TE with a few hours' notice.

It is requested that the Electronic Section

furnish the Phila. Division with a transistorized unit.
