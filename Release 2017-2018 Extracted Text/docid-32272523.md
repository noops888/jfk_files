located Silvia Duran, Horacio Duran, Ruben Duran and

Pedro Gutierrez Valencia and that each person was willing

to be interviewed by the HSCA representatives. Proce-

dure for conduct of the interviews was also discussed

at this meeting.

The Mexican government decided that the initial

to describe the Committee's objectives. The witnesses'

statements would be formalized at a later, taped inter-

view. The Mexican officials informed the HSCA staff mem-

Elena Garro de Paz, Elenita Garro. de Paz and Oscar

Molina. The Mexican Government had not had contact with

the Garros since 1968. The HSCA staff members provided

additional information on Oscar Rodriguez Molina. The

Mexicans said that they were trying to locate the Garros

through the Foreign Ministry since Elena's ex-husband,

Octavio Paz, was an important person in that ministry.

7) Deba Garro de Guerrero Galvan; 8) Eunice Odio;

9) Emilio Carballido; and 10) Victor Rico Galan. The

HSCA also asked to be shown the Cuban Consulate.

The Mexican representatives informed the HSCA

staff that Victor Rico Galan had, at one time, been

arrested on political charges but that he was subse-

quently pardoned by either Diaz Ordaz or Luis Echevarria.

The Mexicans said that they were searching for all files

and newspaper articles requested by the HSCA..

The Mexican officials also offered. their observa-

tions on the preliminary interviews conducted the pre-

vious day. They pointed out that they found it strange

that Silvia had told Oswald he could not travel while

in Cuba. They wondered what she was trying to tell

him and whether she thought that Oswald had some objec-

tive in going to Cuba other than that ascribed by the

popular version. They considered the manner in which

Silvia obtained employment at the Cuban Consulate unusual.

Generally they noted that Silvia and her brothers seemed

to have almost programed responses and a defensive demea-

nor. They pointed out, however, that all the

Durans had

opinion, Ruben Duran was the most credible of those

interviewed by the HSCA the previous day.

At this point, a Mexican official who had been

checking the computer records informed us that Victor

Rico Galan was dead.

HSCA staff members provided the Mexican authori-

ties with the names of the Mexican officials who had

been involved in the investigation in 1963.

HSCA staff members met again with the Mexican po-

lice authorities at 10:00 .a.m. on June 2, 1978. At this

time, the Mexican police provided the copies of the news-.

paper clippings on the assassination from the Excelsior.

HSCA staff members asked if the Mexicans could persuade

the newspapers to reveal the sources of their stories

about Oswald and Silvia Duran. The Mexican officials'

response was negative. The Mexican officials informed

the HSCA staff members. that most of the data we wanted

from the files was in their Security Service files. The

Mexican officials working at the HSCA explained that

they were the Mexican equivalent of the FBI and that

the Security Service was the Mexican equivalent of the

CIA; hence there was the usual bureaucratic problem

cans informed the HSCA representatives that Emilio Car-

billido had been located; that Victor Rico Galan was

dead; that Deba Garro could not be located; and that

there was no record of anyone

named Eunice Odio. HSCA

representatives told the Mexican officials. that odio,

who was either Costa Rican or Guatemalan, had been the

mistress of Emilio Carballido..: The assassination and

the reaction of the Mexican people to this event was

discussed.

At 1:00 p.m., HSCA staff members

conducted an

interview at the United States Embassy in connection

with the CIA aspects of the Mexico City investigation.

At 2:30, Gary Cornwell discussed problems with

the Chief of the Mexico City CIA Station. He requested

that the COS cable Headquarters regarding restrictions

placed on the HSCA staff in Mexico.

At 6:00 p.m., the HSCA staff members, accompanied

by Jesus Meixueiro Kanty and his assistant, Honorio

Escondon, met with the assistant chief of the Mexican

Security Service Nazar. Mr. Nazar gave an oral resume

of the interviews with Mexican officials conducted in

1963 of Silvia,. Horatio. and Ruben Duran and Betty Serratas.

Mr. Nazar

said that the files had to be formally requested

before he could consider releasing them. He suggested

that we secure statements admissible in United States

courts from the witnesses whom we wished to interview.

Mr. Nazar suggested that our best investigatory avenue

would be to concentrate on Oswald's interrogation after

his arrest on November 22nd. Mr. Nazar had a very low

opinion of Elena Garro de Paz's credibility.

June 3 and 4, 1978, were spent on CIA-related

aspects of the Mexico City investigation. Two interviews

were conducted.

At 11:00 a.m. on June 5, 1978, the HSCA staff

try to get a room at either the Hotel Regis or Hotel

San Francisco. Mrs. Contreras explained that since

there were a few conventions scheduled in Mexico City

that weekend she could not assure that he would be at

either. Mrs. Contreras told Agent Martinez that she

would notify him if her husband should call.

Mr. Martinez called both hotels and niquired whether

Oscar Contreras Lartigue was registered. He was not

registered at either; they were completely booked up.

Appendix 4: HSCA Procedural Write-up

Cuba Trip 2

On August 25, 1978, Congressman Richardson Preyer

and HSCA staff members G. Robert Blakey and Edwin Juan

Lopez Soto traveled

to Cuba from Miami at 8:25 a.m. on

an Air-Taxi Service charter plane.

The Committee repre-

sentatives arrived in Cuba at 10:15 a.m. They were met

by the Minister of Justice, Armondo Torres Snatrayll;

Washington Consul Ricardo Escartin; American Department

official, Senen Buergo; and translator, Nellie Ruiz de

Zarade. The Committee representatives were escorted to

their suite, room number 2003, at the Hotel Riviera at

11:00 a.m.

At 12:15 p.m., the Committee representatives met

with Ricardo Escartin, Felipe Villa, Senen Buergo and

translators Juanita Vera and Nellie Ruiz de Zarade. Also

present were two Cuban stenographers. Senen Buergo,

the spokesperson, welcomed the Committee representatives

to Cuba and thanked the Committee for its correspondence.

Mr. Buergo apologized on behalf of the Cuban government

for the postponement of previously scheduled trips of

May 24th and 25th, 1978.

Mr. Buergo stressed that in his

opinion there was

a conspiracy to link Cuba to the assassina-

tion of John F. Kennedy.

At that point, he haded four files

to Congressman Richardson Preyer. The files consisted of:

a) material concerning Santo Trafficante, b) a letter

dated 25 November 1963 from Hernandez Armas: to Raul Roa;

c) the results of the Cuban government's research into

mis-information linking the Cuban Government to the assas-

sination of President John F. Kennedy; and d) the report

of the Investigative Committee of the International Tri-

bunal of the Eleventh Festival reporting on the defamation

campaign to link Cuba to the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

Mr. Buergo stated that both Eusebio Azcue Lopez

and Alfredo Mirabal Diaz would that day be made available

for interviews. Mr. Buergo stated that Nilo Otero would

be made available for interview the following day, 26 August

197,8. Mr. Buergo stated that Rogelio Rodriguez was pre-

sently stationed in West Germany. Bruego stated that Ricardo

Escartin previously interviewed Mr. Rodriguez and was

told by Rodriguez that he had had no contact with Lee Har-

vey Oswald. Mr. Buergo stated that if the Committee still

desired to interview

Rodriguez, he would be made available

to the Committee. Mr. Buergo stated that an interview with

Rolando Cubela Secades would be arranged.

Mr. Buergo asked if the Committee was still inter-

ested in interviewing Orestes Guillermo Ruiz Perez. Mr.

Buergo stated that the Cuban government

had no record

of a citizen named Griselle Rubio. Mr. Buergo inquired

whether the Committee representatives were interested in

watching the videotaped statements of James Wilcott and

Phillip Agee at the Tribunal. Congressman Preyer

responded that the Commitee's representatives would want

to view the Wilcott and Agee videotaped statements.

Mr. Buergo stated that our schedule included dinner

with the Minister of Justice at 8:00 p.m. on 25 August

1978, fishing on 27 August 1978 (Sundad), and a farewell

dinner on 28 August 1978.

Congressman Preyer thanked the Cuban officials for

making both the documents and witnesses available to the

Select Committee.

Professor Blakey stated that the Committee was no

longer interested in interviewing Rolando Cuebela.

Mr.

Blakey stated that Griselle Rubio had been found and inter-

viewed by a Committee investigator. Mr. Blakey stated

that the Committee wanted to interview Oreste Guillermo

Ruiz Perez for two reasons: he worked at the Cuban Embassy

in September 1963 when Oswald allegedly visited the Cuban

compound in Mexico City; and, he is married to the cousin

of a counter-revolutionary, Antonio Veciana Blanch. Mr.

Blakey stated that Rogelio Rodriguez need not be interviewed.

Captain Felipe Villa stated that the Cuban govern-

ment, relying on the seriousness and honesty of the Commit-

tee's work, thought that the Committee should have know-

ledge of Cubela's statements. Mr. Villa stated that the

Commitee still needed to provide the Cuban government

with the following: a) a workable formula on counter-revolu-

tionaries that could be used by the Cuban government to

aid the Committee in its investigation of such organiza-

tions; b) copies of Lee Harvey Oswald's signatures that

the. Cuban government could use to perform its own hand-

writing comparison test; c) E. Howard Hunt's aliases;

and d) public information of interest to the Cuban govern-

ment that the Committee could provide without violating

its rules.

Mr. Blakey stated that examples of Lee Harvey Os-

wald's handwriting would be forthcoming. Mr. Blakey stated

that the Committee had not yet developed a formula for

identifying counter-revolutionary groups active against

the Cuban government in 1963 or a method for providing

E. Howard Hunt's aliases. Mr. Blakey stressed that both

these areas would be discussed in

the Committee's final

report.

VII. Analysis of Lee Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico

City

A. Introduction

After-the Warren Commission investigation published

its report two very important allegations related to Lee

Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico. City have come to

the attention of the United States investigative agencies.

In 1964, Elena Garro de Paz reported that she had seen Lee

Harvey Oswald, accompanied by two other men, at a party

at the home of Ruben Duran Navarro, the brother-in-law of

Silvia Duran. (See Section VI, C.) In 1967, Oscar Con-

treras Lartigue reported that he met Lee Harvey Oswald on

the campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico.

(UNAM)

(See Section VI, D, above.)

In addition, the testimony of the Warren Commission's

primary witness related to Mexico City, Silvia Tirado Duran,

has been called into question. (See Warren Report pp. 299-

304, 733-736; and Sections I, B, V, C, and VI, A, above.)

Some of the information that is inconsistent with Ms. Duran's

original story, that Oswald visited the Cuban Consulate on

two occasions, which were the only times she saw him, was

available at the time of the Warren Commission's inquiry

although it was ignored; some of the information has developed

after the publication of the Warren Report. (See Sections

•V, C and VI, A and B respectively for details.)

The Garro and Contreras allegations in conjunction

with the weakening. of Ms. Duran's story raise three major

questions: did Lee Harvey Oswald or an imposter visit the

Cuban Consulate in Mexico City?; other than his visits

to the Cuban Consulate, what

were Lee Harvey Oswald's acti-

vities in Mexico City?; and, was Lee Harvey Oswald travel-

ling alone in Mexico? (These three questions do, of course,

overlap somewhat in detail. For example, if Oswald was

not tarveling alone, did one of his companions impersonate

him at the Cuban Consulate? Each of the three questions

will be dealt with in separate sections below. If the dis-

cussion at times seems

slightly redundent it is because

that

is an unavoidable side-effect of the interrelatedness

of the questions.)

In an attempt to answer the questions posed above

the House Select Committee on Assassinations has: 1) inter-

viewed Mexican and Cuban citizens who could have knowledge

of Oswald's visits to the Cuban Consulate; 2) Interviewed

Mexican citizens who could have knowledge of Oswald's ac=

tivities and associations in Mexico City; 3) Conducted an

extensive review of the files of the Central Intelligence

Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that pertain

to Oswald's sojourn in Mexico City.

B. Did Lee Harvey Oswald or an Imposter Contact

the Cuban and Soviet Consulates in Mexico City?

Lee Harvey Oswald himself probably visited the Cuban

Consulate at least once since his application for a Cuban

intransit visa bears his signature. (Cite to Handwriting

analysis.) Though the Cuban Consulate allowed visa appli-

cants to take blank. applications out of the Consulate to

be returned when completed, Silvia Duran was certain that

Oswald signed the application in her presence. (HSCA Inter-

view of Silvia Duran, 6/6/78, JFK Document #311681, pp. 31-

33.) Oswald's signature on the Cuban visa application,

however, does not by itself rule out the possibility

that someone impersonated Oswald. in contacts with the

Cuban and Soviet Embassies.

An analysis of the telephone conversations which

the CIA's Mexico City Station intercepted by…tapping the

Soviet Consulate and the Soviet Military Attache's tele-

phone reveals that someone, later identified as Oswald,

visited the Cuban Consulate at least two times and the

Soviet Consulate at least thress times. (See Sections II,

c, III, A, 1, and III, B, 2, above.) On September 27,

1963, at 4:05 p.m. Silvia Duran called the Soviet Consulate.

In this conversation she refers to an American seeking an

intransit visa to Cuba. The substantive information given›

indicates that she is discussing Oswald. (See Section III,

B, 2, above.) At this time the individual using Oswald's

name has been at the Soviet Embassy

at least once already

since Silvia requests the name of the Soviet Embassy offi-

cial who dealt with the American. (CIA Transcript from

the Russian Embassy, 9/27/63.) Silvia also stated that

the American is, at that time, in the Cuban Consulate.

(Ibid.) At 4:26 p.m. a Soviet Consular official returned

Silvia Duran's call. This official states specifically

that Oswald had visited the Soviet Consulate. (Ibid.)

On September 28, 1963, at 11:51 a.m. Silvia Duran

called the Soviet Consulate. (Ibid.) She put the Ameri-

can, later identified as Oswald, on the telephone. (Ibid.)

The American, who was at the Cuban Consulate at the time,

said that he had just been at the Soviet Consulate. (Ibid.)

The conversation ends with the American stating that he

was returning to the Soviet Consulate. (CIA Transcript

from the Russian Embassy, 9/28/63.)

stories would tend to indicate that Oswald, or someone

impersonating him, visited the Cuban Consulate at least

one and possibly two additional times on September 27,

1963.

Silvia Duran says that Oswald first visited the

Cuban Consulate at approximately 11:00 a.m. requesting

an intransit visa to Cuba with Russia as the final de-

stination. (Duran Interview, 6/6/78, JFK Document #011681.)

Ms. Duran sent Oswald to obtain photographs that he needed

for the visa application. (Ibid., p. 20-23.) Eusebio

Azcue recalls that this visit probably occured on the

date on the visa application, 9/27/63. (Public testimony

of Eusebio Azcue, 9/18/78, p. 36.)

Although unlikely, if

someone impersonated Oswald

in Mexico, it is possible that the individual's first

visit occured before Oswald's arrival. It is unlikely

because such actions would have been poor tradecraft.)

Ms. Duran also stated that Oswald returned at ap-

proximately 1:00 p.m. with four photographs. (Duran In-

terview, 6/6/78, JFK Document #011681, p. 23.) Eusebio

Azcue also stated that the individual later identified

as Oswald returned to the Cuban Consulate about 1:00 p.m.

with the photographs probably on "the date that appears

on the application, that is to say on the 27th." (Public

Testimony of Eusebio Azcue, 9/18/78, p. 32-33) The argu-

ment between Azcue and the individual probably occured

during this visit. (See Sections V, C, and VI, B, above.)

Ms. Duran stated that Oswald's third, and last visit,

occured in the late afternoon after working hours on the

27th. (Duran Interview, 6/6/78, JFK DoC.

#011681, p. 37.)

This visit is confirmed by the CIA's tap on the Soviet

Consulate. (See above.) '

IN addition to the alleged Oswald visits to the Con-

sulates, there were other telephonic contacts that may

have been between Oswald, or an imposter, and the Consulates.

(See Sections III, A, 1, and III, B, above.)

Several details about Oswald's visits to the Cuban

Consulate, and telephonic contacts with both Consulates

indicate that the individual involved was not Oswald.

Sivlia Duran's description of Oswald did not

resemble Oswald's true physical appearance. (HSCA Inter-

view of Silvia Duran, 6/6/78, JFK DOC. #01668; Cite also

early report. See Section V, C for details.)

This

description, which appeared early in the reporting of in-

formation obtained from Ms. Duran was deleted from subse-

quent reports and was not at all mentioned in the Warren

Report. See Sections V, C, for details.) Eusebio Azcue's

description of Oswald was similar to Silvia Duran's, but

Elena Garra de Paz' description of one of Oswald's alleged

companions.

(See Section VI, C, above and VII, B, below.)

(NOTE: add blond man on Knoll if found.)

Another possible indication that an imposter, as

well as Oswald, visited the Consulate is the 9/28/63 inter-

cepted conversation. Silvia Duran adamantly denies that

Oswald visited the Cuban. Consulate on Saturday, September

28, 1963. In light of the CIA intercept of that date,

Ms. Duran has either lied to the Committee or the individual

who visited the Consulate on September I8 was not Oswald.

(Note: the CIA's classification of the transcript. of this

conversation prevented the HSCA from directly confronting

Ms. Duran with the information.) Ms. Duran, in light of

the inconsistencies detailed in Sections V, C and VI, A

above, may not be the most credible witness but there are

indications that she was truthful when she stated that Os-

wald did not visit the Consulate on September 28. The

September 28, 1963 conversation was linked to Oswald be-

cause of the marginal notations made by the CIA translator

on the transcript. (See Sections II, C, 4 3 and III, A, 1

above.) The translator noted on the transcript that the

caller spoke "terrible, hardly recognizable Russian."

(Cite transcript.) On October 1, 1963, a man called

the Soviet Consulate and identified himself as "Lee Os-

wald." (Cite transcript.) This man also stated that he

had been at the Consulate on Saturday, the 28th. (Ibid.)

The translator noted that this was the same man who had

called the Consulate "a day or so ago" and had spoken

in broken Russian. From this information, and possibly

a voice comparison (see

Section IV, B, above) the 9/28

caller was identified as Oswald. The problem with assum-

ing that the caller on 9/28 and 10/9 was Oswald is that

Oswald spoke fluent Russian. (Cites.) Granted, Ms.

Duran's denial of the Saturday visit and the proficiency

of the caller's Russian is not sufficient evidence to

conclude that the person who visited the Cuban Consulate

on Saturday and who called the Soviet Consulate on Satur-

day and on October Ist was an imposter:. Yet the informa-

tion is sufficient to seriously question the assumption

that it was Oswald, especially in light of Azcue's: and Duran's

descriptions and Elena Garro de Paz's story.

Three calls that also occured early on September

27, 1963, may have been made by an imposter. At approxi-

mately 10:30 a.m. a man called the Soviet Military Attache

looking for a visa to Odessa and was referred to the So-

viet Consulate. At 10:37 a.m. a man called the Soviet

Consulate and asked for a visa to Odessa. He was told

to call back at 11:00. At 1:25 p.m. a man called the

Consul between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m. that day.

while only the callers' requests for a visa to

Russia (Odessa) connect these calls to Oswald, the HSCA

believes that they do fit logically into a time sequence

created by what is known from testimony and the electronic

intercepts about his actions on that day. The following

is a reasonable possible chronology of Oswald's actions

on 9/27/63 based on analysis of the available evidence.

Oswald probably arrived in Mexico around 10:00 a.m. on

September 27. (Cite WR.) By 10:30 Oswald had time to

arrive at the Hotel del Comercio and to place a

call to

the Soviet Military Attache. who. referred him to the Consul.

The military attache also gave the caller directions to

the Consuläte.

durina the 10:37 a.m. call to the Con-

sulate the caller learned that he could contact the Consul

at 11:00 a.m. This done, Oswald then went to the Cuban

Consulate where he arrived around 11:00 a.m. (HSCA Inter-

view with Silvia Duran, 6/6/78. JFK Doc. #011681, p. 31.)

This meeting only lasted approximately fifteen minutes i

and sent Oswald to obtain photographs and to the Russian

Embassy to get the necessary Russian visa. (HSCA Inter=

view of Silvia Duran, 6/6/78, JFK Doc. #11681, p. 23.)

Oswald returned to the Cuban Consulate around 1:00 p.m.

(Ibid., p. 31.) At this point he had his encounter with

Azcue and completed this VISA application. (Ibid.) Oswald

probably realized at this point that he would have prob-

lems obtaining the visas. After this visit to the Cuban

Consulate, which lasted approximately Fifteen minutes

(Public testimony of Alfredo Mirabal Diaz, 9/18/78, p. 119)

Oswald tried to contact the Soviet Consul whom Oswald

claimed had assured him that he would have no problems

obtaining a visa. (Cite.) Hence, the 1:25 call. During

this conversation Oswald learned that the Consul would

be in that evening between 4:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m.

Os-

wald returned to the Cuban Consulate at 4:00 and persuaded

Silvia Duran to intercede with the Soviet Consul on his

behalf. (HSCA Interview of Silvia Duran, 6/6/78, JFK DOC.

#01168, p. 37.)

Hence, the 4:05 and 4:26 p.m. calls in-

volving Duran.

But there is a problem with attributing the first

three calls on September 27, 1963 to Oswald. The conversa-

tions are all in Spanish. With the exception of Delgado

the evidence indicates that Oswald did not speak Spanish.

(Cites.)

Hence, either the above-detailed calls were not

made by Oswald or Oswald could speak English.

There is not enough evidence to firmly conclude

that some one did impersonate Oswald in Mexico. On the..

other hand, the evidence is

of such a nature that the pos-

sibility cannot be dismissed.
