A.

... ((If)) you had it.

And when we come to your education we will add it to what I have said

((about parents, background, etc.)) - your education in high school,

the Navy school, and the Institute of International Relations.

B. I do not know what you want to say.

A. I want to say that ((since)) you have found the ((in English)) excuse

of "taking into account my higher education," we will return to this

question; I just want to remind you so that you will not forget.

I will put this all together....

B. (*Please? or ?too bad?)

A. ...In time....

B. Of course, of course.

A. I would like you to find something better....

B. I cannot find anything better, because I did not decide the question

about myself; I do not know how the question was decided....

A. I am asking you, from the point of view

of a counterintelligence

officer, how do you ('revaluate?) ((this))?

B. And I do not intend to resolve the question of my life on ((to conform

with)) one date.

A. Place yourself in the place of SHUBNYAKOV Or FEDOTOV, having in mind

the position of ((some)) IVANOV as if it were yours

—- what would be

your decision?

B. I do not know; if I were in his place, then it would be another thing

(XG) .

A. Because you told us at one time that you were a worthy counter-

intelligence officer.

But now you modestly say that you were such a simple, little....

B.

In 1953, in 1954....

A. ...A little case officer.

B. Now, why are you turning things around?

That is not right.

In 1953, 1954, 1955 and 1956, I really was nothing; I was only a case

officer.

If you are talking about 1954, you are right.

A. Yes.

B. Right; what do you want me to tell you -- that in 1954 they valued me

and liked me and respected me?

A. Oh, do you remember, in

the beginning, in

the beginning, when you

had just established contact with us, how ((you said)) you had worked

against the journalists, against military attaches, and that you had

recruited dozens of Americans, and so forth.

B. Not at all, not at all; you do not have to... you do not have to paint

things

that way....

A. I can simply remind you of that which you said earlier; nothing more.

B. You do not have to paint things that way.

A. Anyway let us think about where the bones lie hidden.

B. ((Long pause)) I do not know, I do not know.

What kind of bones?

Where'?

I do not know.

((Long pause)) I do not know.

What kind of bones?

I do not know anything.

I never said that I was an ideal and outstanding worker.

I worked as I could and as I had to.

I never said that I had recruited dozens.

If I participated, I participated.

I have told how they treated me.

A. As if you were the best man, they sent you to Geneva... as the best

counterintelligence officer.

B. How "as the best"?

In 1962, it was necessary for them to send not a senior case officer,

nor a case officer, but someone higher.

A. Well, that you were bigger does not fit - I do not see it.

You understand -- if you somewhere somewhat....

B. ((Interrupts)) You know, this will not kill me, because I already have

heard this 482 ((times)) -- I have heard that I was not a good employee

that I am nothing.

I have heard this more than once; please continue in the same spirit.

A. I do not think that anyone told you that you are nothing.

B. Well, they did not say "nothing" - that is right; it would be rude....

It is right that I have exaggerted; absolutely right.

How many times has it been said, "Well, what kind offa worker were you?

What kind?"

A. We still do not have the KGB here - we have not come to that yet.

B.

Right, right; yes - you have not come to that but... somewhat...

something I did not expect from American intelligence or counterintelli-

gence.

A .

What, for example?

B. Let us not talk about it - this is a

stage that already has been

passed; it is behind.

A.

Well, I am interested in knowing.

B. You know everything very well.

You know every letter, every stage; you know everything

A. If I knew everything, then we would not have to be talking.

B. No, I say, what was, was; you know.

A. I do not know what you have in mind; I do not think that we did

anything unusual; I do not think there was anything out of the

ordinary; it was just everyday life.

B. That is not life; it was a sad existence.

A. Well, let us see, let us talk about it - whose fault is it?

B. Well, how is it my fault?

I am doing time.

You tell me, "We do not believe you" ((but)) this is not a reason for

• a man to do time.

A. Do not look for the entire fault in yourself; I am not blaming only you..

B. No, I understand - that over there ((the KGB))....

A. Yes, "over there"....

B.

...Excuse me, they are crapping on me.....

A. ...Yes, "over there", "over there".

B.

I understand that, over

there, they.

A. What -- "over there"?

B.

Well... that they - through the agent network and through trusted

persons, etc. -- they are "giving it to"me.

I know how it is done, how a man can be turned into nothing, into

nothing!

I know this.

Whether you want it or not, there is something coming from over there;

I know about this very well.

A. We will talk about what is coming ((from over there)) and what is not

coming.

Of course, you are interested in knowing what is coming; but I would

like to know what you think is going on there.

B. What do I think?

What do I think?

I think, I know, that, of course, a decision already has been made

about me, and they have sentenced me

to death;

and some kind

of case

has been opened against me, just as a case was opened against GOLITSYN,

But why control them?

B. Well, perhaps a letter might go through.

A. Well, anyway ((it is said that)) the KGB has changed; they

B. Who told you that.

A.

That is what they write.

B. "They

A. They simply are so kind that they are kissing the Soviet people's asses.

B.

Oh, yes.

A. Well, if they are not so good, in your opinion, then....

...What is holding you back from opening your heart and forgetting your

past?

They ((the KGB)) are entirely to blame, etc.;. why do you not make up

your mind to say, "Screw them", and begin from the very beginning and

tell the truth.

B. Iran telling you only the truth, absolutely.

((XG; A and B speak at the same time))

A. Well, you are forgetting that we have just finished talking for the

last hour about the anketa, and you could not answer the simplest things.

B. I am telling you what I remember.

A. One cannot believe that you worked there; I to not know what keeps you

from talking sense, as they

say.

B.

Well, why do you say that?

A. ((Pause)) Well, one more question - what do you know about the

Personnel record sheet (lichnyy listok po uchetu kadrov).

B. What Personnel record sheet?

A. What is the Personnel record sheet?

What kind of document is it?

B. I do not know; I do not know the Personnel record sheet, I do not know.

A. Well, on every Party member and every Komsomol member working in the

organs of the MVD or in government work, or even a non-Party member

having some higher education or qualifications and on whom there is a

personnel file in the KGB or the Council of Ministers or the CC CPSU

and so forth... the CPSU Central Committee issues this Personnel record

sheet; it is some sort of anketa.

B. I do not know it.

A. It is completed by everyone.

B. I never completed it; I do not know what it is; I do not know.

A. It is not very important to the MVD, but - in accordance with a CC CPSU

decision - every employee fills it out.

B. I do not know, I do not know

A. It represents a true picture of the educated employees.

B. What goes into it?

A. There is the usual information in it, but I do not want to explain

what there is.

B. I do not know, I do not know.

A. It begins with the questions - surname, first name, patronymic; date

and place of birth; social background; duration of Party membership;

Party identification card number.

This sheet is, as they say, a Party-Komsomol record; it is completed

by each employee; it is included in the Personnel file before the

anketa.

B. I absolutely do not remember this sheet or its completion, absolutely.

A. This, again, is one of the proofs that forces the conclusion that....

B. Honest, I absolutely do not remember this sheet or its completion inithe

Personal

files into which I looked.

I looked

into Personnel

files.

Because in 1962, 1963, we hired for the Third Section, restaurants and

hotels, a large number

of

former KGB employees as non-staffers; only

former employees.

And I do not remember this ((sheet)) .

A. You probably saw their fersonnel files, because -- when a man is

released - his file is sent to the Archives; then anyone can take the

file if he wants to make use of this employee.

((XG; A and B speak at the same time))

B. I absolutely do not remember this sheet.

A. How do you explain that you do not remember your Party card number?

B. I do not remember it, I do not remember.

((XG; A and B speak at the same time))

Look -- hear me out, please; you asked me why I do not remember it --

I will tell you: you pay your dues; you go to a meeting

and you know

you have to show your card, so you take it with you; I did not have to

give the number; I take it along; you keep it in the safe.....

A. I am not asking because anyone wants to know this number; but there

is a procedure in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union -- every

member öf the Party is obliged to know the number of his Party card.

((XG; A and B speak at the same time))

It is not written ((in the Regulations)), but there is a procedure and

the Party Secretary always asks.

A. I do not want to exaggerate, but I simply want to say that the

Secretary always asks when a man pays his dues -- particularly new

members, if they remember the number of their Party card.

B.

Well, they could ask; absolutely right.

((XG; A and B speak at the same time))

A. It is, as they say, in the blood stream

except, of course, some stupid person who does not have any memory at

all; he does not remember - but all the rest remember.

B. ((In English)) Thank you very much.

A. Well, I did not have ((you)) in mind....

B.

No, no, no, I understand, I understand.

A. But it is logical to remember.

I was a member of the Party but long ago.

B. And do you remember the number?

A. I remember the number quite well; it has stayed in my memory, and I

still remember it.

I do not recall my Komsomol card number.

I do not know whether I knew it well; probably I did.

But I remember my Party card number -- tand that was more than 20 years

ago.

B. Look -- just a minute; there is another number - every employee has

a serial number (lichnyy nomer); it is a metal plate.

You keep it in the safe.

This number is indicated in the identification card which you carry

with you every day, day and night.

I do not remember it, but I know it had four digits:

"Yeo"', and then

the number.

A. Of course, no one ever asked you to remember the number of your

identification card.

B. No, this is not the identification card number; this is a serial number.

A. What kind of a serial number?

For what purpose is it?

B. It is for use in case of war, if you should die.

A. When did they introduce this serial number?

B. I do not remember; I do not remember.

A. Well, you see, you contradict yourself - on one hand, you try to

prove that you were there, that you worked, but you cannot answer the

simplest question about the number, and you do not know it.

Well, very well; let us take this line -- how many Party cards have you

had altogether?

B. A candidate membership card in 1956;

when I was accepted in

A. When was the Party card exchange?

B. That was before I was accepted, in 1955 or 1954.

A. At that time, did you receive a new Party card?

B. Well, this was before my time.

In 1956, I received a candidate membership card and in 1957, a member-

ship card; it was before my acceptance into the Party, in 1955 or 1954.

A. Were there any other circumstances under which you exchanged....?

B. The card?

No.

A. Where did you leave your card when you left?

B. In the safe... no, no; I lied - I left it with the Secretary of the

Party organization.

A. What - does every one have to turn them in when going abroad?

B. Not only when going abroad.

You

see, I went abroad on TDY; I knew that I would be gone a month or

two; the rule was to give it to the Secretary, and I left. it with the

Secretary.

I entrust the receipt of pay for February and March to an employee --

SHINGAREV -- to take out the dues, and pay the loan cashier;

the rest

of

it - to my wife.

And the Party card goes to the Secretary.

If you go on a trip, and you know that you will be gone for 15 days and

you will be paid in the meantime, you leave the money and also the

Party card with the Secretary.

We will stop for today; we will continue our talk another time.

A. Well, what is new today?

B. The old day has passed; a new day - the 483rd -- has begun.

A.

483rd?

B. 483rd.

May I have a cigarette:

A. You still have not forgotten how to count the days?

B. I count on my fingers;

besides that,

I take threads from my blanket and

make numbers.

For instance, the first of July; the next day is the second of July;

From the preceding number, I make

a new number every day;

that

is how

I count.

A. What other means of counting do you have?

You can lose yourself that way.

B.

No; there is a whole number of ways.

I save every day, every month.

The guard detail changes every Friday - that is exactly a week; new

guards come.

I am telling you -- I do not count: one, two, etc.

When I get to 365, it makes a year, and I begin again.

When I get to 400 -- it was on the 8th of May - and I began again,

because on the 8th of May it was exactly 400 days.

And, besides that, there are these numbers that I make from the threads.

A. But do you not make any other marks?

B. No; well, I did one time - I put scratches on the door: the lst of

1/65 equals 272 days; and then, there was another date: 3/4/65 -- it

equals 65 days.

That is how.

A .

Well, perhaps we should return to our discussion about the Komsomol.

I do not think that we have covered everything;

we did not agree with

each other everywhere.

Do you still insist that you were Secretary of the Komsomol organization

of the Second Chief Division?

Tell me, as a friend to friend,

where you were.

B. What would I get out of it ((to tell lies))?

Neither a minus, nor a plus.

A. I would not get anything out of it.

B. No, me, not you -- I am talking about myself, about my biography, my

activities; this would give me neither a plus, nor a minus.

A. You know, we have spoken about the Komsomol - we have spoken about

this matter twice; and I want to talk about this subject for the last

time.

The Komsomol does not operate the way you described it.

If a person were Secretary of a Komsomol organization, he would know

more than the rank-and-file Komsomol member; ((but)) I am not asking

to answer as a Secretary of a ((Komsomol)) Committee.

B. I do not remember the name of the Committee Secretary.

A. Well, let us say, the Secretary of a Komsomol organization in the most

important directorate in the MVD -- in counterintelligence, or the

Second Directorate, as you want to call it -- if

he were the Secretary,

as you say, for approximately a year, he would have had some kind of

contact with the Secretary of the ((Komsomol)) Committee of the MVD,

simply because of his Komsomol work.

B. I tell you contact is maintained with the Second Directorate by KOZMIN

and SOKOLOV -- those two men.

A. During the time you were Secretary of the Komsomol organization, how

many Komsomol conferences were held in the MVD?

There probably were at least one during the year.

B. There was, there was, there was... because I....

A. You probably selected delegates from your Komsomol organization, and

you yourself as Secretary should have attended it.

B. Of course, of course.

A. Well, tell me about this conference; you probably saw the Secretary and

gave him documents on those whom you had selected to be delegates to

this conference, and so forth; a great deal of preparatory work had to

be carried out.

B. I do not remember; I do not even remember what was discussed at the

conferences; of course, there were conferences or meetings of the aktiv,:

something…..

A. Well, I am not asking what was discussed; I am just asking about the

procedure.

You say you do not remember the name of the Secretary of the MVD

Komsomol Committee; in my opinion, you should know; if you were the

Secretary of the Komsomol organization of the Second Chief Directorate

you had to know.

B. I do not know; why do not I know?

Because, after all, he was not a star in the sky.

I simply fulfilled social obligation; I just had to....

B. I do not remember his name; I do not remember.

A. For this reason alone, it is difficult for me to believe that you were

a Secretary.

Very

well, I will help you; we will begin with this -- what important

event -- which you could

in no way forget or overlook -- took place in

the Komsomol in 1953-1954 at the time you were Secretary?

B.

I do not remember.

A. I ask you again; if you were the Secretary, you must remember this

great event.

B.

I do not remember it.

A. Well, I will remind you about this great event - it was just at the

time when you were Secretary, and it was quite important - it was the

Moscow City Komsomol Conference in February 1954, when delegates were

elected from all Komsomol organizations, including the MiD or the KGB,

whatever you want to call it; and you, of course, as a Secretary had

to take an active part in it -- to be at the aktiv meetings of the NVD

Komsomol, to

select candidates, and perhaps even to make a speech.

Even

if you did not deliver a speech at least you had to be there and

to vote, etc.

B. I do not remember.

A. This was your last Komsomol position while you were working, in the

MVD or anywhere else, and I think you should remember it.

Well, as you told me last time, a Komsomol member can be any person

of

what age?

B. I will tell you right now - from the age of 14 they can be taken into

the Komsomol.

A. And to the age of?...

B. To the age of 27.

A. Are you sure of this?

B. Yes.

A. Well, you can imagine that a Secretary must know.

B. Until the age of 27.

A. 27?

((Pause)) I will read you a paragraph from the Komsomol Regulations

for 1949.

B.

Why 19492

This

was

in 1953-1954.... 1949.

hat

A. Just before this, I asked you want important event took place in

March 1954.

B. I do not remember this.

A. There was a Komsomol Congress....

B. There were such... it was not the only one.

A.

...At which new regulations were adopted.

It was not the only one, but it was the next one after 1949, the next

one.

From 1949 until this Congress, they lived according to these regulations

but from 1954 they began to live differently.

None of the regulations before 1949, after 1949, or after 1954 said

anything about "up to 27 years of age".

From Komsomol'skaya Pravda, 7 April 1949:

"Anyone from the age

to 26 can be a member of the VLKSM...."

Another Congress took place, 30 March 1954: "Anyone from the age of 14

- 18 -

to 26 can be a member of the VLKSM...." -- this was in 1954.

Further, here are other Regulations, published in Moscow in 1958:

"Anyone from the age of 15 to 28 can be a member of the VLKSM...."

this was when they changed the Regulations.

Never in the history of the Komsomol, beginning in 1919, have the

Regulations anywhere said anything about "up to 27 years of age"; it

always was "up to 26" and then they changed it to "up to 28".

B. (3G) I left for reason of age in 1956. (54?)

A. I do not want to argue.

You could have left for reason of age when you were 27 years old; I

do not at all deny this - I only am reminding you that yesterday you

insisted that the Regulations say "up to 27, and that is all"

I did not argue with you then; I simply told you that it never was "up

to 27"; it was "up to 26".

And now... I do not know what reason you had, etc.; I have only one

question - did they make some sort of exception for you?

B. They did not make-any kind of exception for me.

A. Then what is the matter?

A secretary has to know - right?

What do you think -- the Secretary of the Komsomol Organization of the

Second Chief Directorate; all of Soviet counterintelligence was working

there, and he does not know that, at the time when he was Secretary,

a Komsomol Congress took place, and new Regulations were adopted?

B. I do not remember.

A. It was a big event; a Congress does not take place every year.

By the way, how often are Komsomol Congresses held?

B. I do not remember.

A. Well, just between us, do you think there is basis for me to believe

that you were a Secretary?'

B. I cannot tell you anything more about this; I simply do not remember.

A. "I do not remember" - this is not the answer of a counterintelligence

officer; one can answer "I do not remember" to all questions.

B. A counterintelligence officer is not God.

He is just like any other man -- IVANOV, PETROV, SIDOROV -- working in

shop or somewhere else; the only difference is that he is working in

counterintelligence, and the other, in a shop.

A. You know,

if you were a Secretary of the Komsomol organization of a

crutch factory, I would not ask you such questions, because the

Secretary of the Komsomol organization of a crutch factory could forget

but an employee of counterintelligence, of the Second Chief Directorate,

could not forget this, not because he was Secretary or a Komsomol

member, but because this is the daily work of a counterintelligence

officer: to know all of the Regulations, because he is working with

people; he recruits, he develops, he arrests, etc.; he has business with

the Komsomol and with the Party every day.

B. Right.

A. Well, he comes in contact with the Regulations and with other documents

and instructions -- this is why I told you, "This is not the answer

of a counterintelligence officer"; he should know more than a simple

kolkhoz worker or a member of a feather shop.

B. Ah, ah. ...

A. The same thing goes for the matter of membership dues.

On what basis did you say, "Two percent, and that is all"?

B. Just as I remember it.

I am telling you and answering you just as I remember.

A. Let us talk as friend to friend; today you are saying, "Just as I

remember it"; yesterday you did not say, "Just as I remember

it";

yesterday you said, "I know ((it was)) two percent exactly".

B. I said, "Two percent for the highest paid"; there was no one who paid

20 kopecks.

A. This is not true; there never was a single scale.

The Komsomol ((member)) always pays the same as the Party, with the

exception that in the latest new komsomol Regulations,

a new scale is

provided.

I will read it to you now.

B. This, again, is since

1958.

In 1958, I was not in the Komsomol; I was nowhere.

A. Before this, the scale was not written up in the Komsomol Regulations;

they paid the same way they paid

in the Party - the same percentage,

regardless of how much ((pay)) they received, the same percentage, but

they did not "cut their hair with the same comb" ((i.e., the percentages.

varied within the scale, although the scales were the same for both

Komsomol and Party)).

B. Do you have the pre-1958 ((Komsomol)) Regulations?

Do you have the Regulations for 1954?

A. A scale is written out there.

B. No scale was written out there.

Without a scale, how much do they take?

A. Only the entrance dues are written up there.

What is the difference between entrance and membership dues?

Explain it to me.

B. The very same amount; absolutely the same amount for both entrance and

The entrance ((dues)) - these are the first dues ((paid)); you pay

this when you enter ((the organization)).

A. ((Reads:)) "The financial resources of the Komsomol consist of member-

ship dues and other income.

A Komsomol member who is at the same time a candidate Party member is

excused from payment of the dues...."

B.

They pay to the Party.

A. ((Continues to read:)) "...Entrance dues in the amount of

B.

so....

A. "...Of his monthly pay."

B. Two percent from the others also.

A. ((In English)) No, no.

B. Two percent a month... honestly... one minute....

Why entrance dues?

As soon as I was accepted in the Komsomol, my first dues -- not for

the month, but for entrance - was two percent, just as I would pay per

month.

A. Now I will show you were the scale is written.

B. The scale?

two percent.

Maybe, in the new ((Regulations)), but I am telling you — two percent,

A. New currency.

In the old Regulations, they took ((dues)) the

same as for Party members

B. This is new currency; before that, they paid two percent - the same as

for the entrance dues; please believe me.

A. Why are you declaring something that is untrue.

((XG; A and B speak at the same time))

Do you want me to find the booklet ((Regulations)) and bring it to you?

B. No; the entrance dues were the same as the monthly dues -- two percent

of the pay.

A. What are entrance dues?

The first dues you pay upon entering the Komsomol.

You pay it once; the usual you pay every month.

A. There were special instruction of the CC VLKSM on the collection of

membership dues, which were sent to all Komsomol organizations, and

until the most

recent Regulations the scale was not given, except the

entrance

dues -- two

percent.

Here, in one ((set of)) Regulations, it is written: "Entrance dues are

taken upon entrance into the Komsomol - two percent of the monthly

salary.

From Komsomol members

who do not receive a monthly salary, entrance dues

are taken in accordance with the instructions of the CC VLKSM."

A. (IG) .

B. Just as the entrance dues, the membership dues -- two percent.

A. I even would not want to insist on ((I should not have to press)) this

question, becuase the Secretary of a Komsomol organization should know

this

as he knows his five fingers.

Of course, he could forget something, but it

is nonsense to insist upon

"27 years of age" and some other things ((such as this)).

You know that even the lowest Komsomol member knows such things.

((Pause)) Let us go back and talk further about the Komsomol.

How and where were you actually removed from the Komsomol rolls before

you were enrolled in the Konsomol in the MVD?

B. I did not get off the Komsomol rolls anywhere, because I was on leave;

I was on the rolls of the Komsomol organization of the MRP, in Sovetsk.

A. What was the Komsomol organization of the MRP in the city of Sovetsk

called?

B.

I told you that I do not remember exactly, but it should have been

called the primary Komsomol organization of such-and-such a military

unit.

A. To whom was the organization subordinate?

((Pause)) Perhaps I should give you some leading questions so that you

can better remember.

Let us start with this

-- you came to the Baltic area

or Sovetsk; as

you said before, when did you get there?

Tell me why.

B. Because the train does not go there, on that spot.

A. Then why do you have to wait until I tell you that you did not arrive

in Baltiysk, but in Kaliningrad:

B.

I arrived at Baltiysk; Kaliningrad is a transfer point.

Very well, I have arrived in the Far East... just a minute... in the

Far East, I made a stop at Khabarovsk, then

at Komsomolsk-na-Amur, then

I had to take the train to kaliningrad, and then from there it was

only several kilometers to Baltiysk.

From Kaliningrad to Baltiysk - you got there by hitchhiking.

To whom did you turn when you arrived at the Headquarters of the Baltic

How did you find the Intelligence Headquarters?

B. I was not at the Headquarters of the Baltic Fleet, the Headquarters of

the Fourth Baltic Fleet.

I got to Baltiysk, found the First Commandant's Office, and asked how

I could get to Military Unit such-and-such; I was told on what street

it was: After all, it is not a large town.

B. Well, perhaps it took an hour while they arranged for transportation;

the auto took me to the MRP; this is several kilometers away - from

Baltiysk to Sovetsk.

A. Approximately how many kilometers?

B. Well, look; Baltiysk is on a spit, at the center of the spit.

You come down from the spit to the mainland, where Sovetsk is located.

B. I do not remember, I do not remember.

A. What address did you give them?'

B. City, then military unit; it is possible to write just "Military Unit

so-and-so", then to so-and-so.

A. Well, we have come to the question that I wanted

to ask you - the

Far East.

B. And the same goes for Sovetskaya Gavan' -- "Sovetskaya Gavan', or just

"military Unit 90176".

A. There is a certain rule - there is no "either... or".

((Which was it --)) Both the city and the military unit were indicated,

or only the military unit without the city?

B. I received letters addressed both to the city and the military unit, and

simply to the military unit.

A. And what regulations were in force?

B. During the war, during the war....

A. We are not talking about war time, but....

B. Oh, no....

A.

We are talking about 1952, when you were in the Baltic area.

If you want to talk about the war, we can go back to the war at anoter

the war.

A.

...In this instance, I am simply talking without any particular sense of

anger or offense.

B. Well, why be angry?

You are doing your job; you are working.

It is another thing that you are putting out hooks; that is another

A. I do not think there are any hooks.

B. Oh, yes; my God! =

Look at your questions.

A. Just a minute; for two days, I have been listening to you, and you

always insist upon "Sovetsk, Primorskiy Kray."

I think that one of us is crazy.

B. I am not crazy, but maybe I soon will be; I have been imprisoned for

483 days....

I have read nothing; the brain needs training, exercise.

B: But when I do not remember, I try to remember (XG).

A. You said earlier that the distance from Baltiysk to Sovetsk is 10-15

kilometers, right?

But when Sovetsk is not near Baltiysk at all...

B. Well, Primorsk, Primorsk!

A. How can one believe you'?

What is the matter?

B.

Well, look -- if you are going to count 10-15 kilometers, and if it is

25... you will ask, "how

is that?"

A. I have not the slightest intention of arguing about two, ten or five

kilometers, absolutely none.

This

is not my problem, because I...

B. I understand; you are looking at it from the point of view that I said

Sovetsk, and you look for Sovetsk, but there is no Sovetsk; so, you

say, "What is he saying?"

A. I do not have to look - I know where Sovetsk is.

This is my

next question - there is a Sovetsk in Kalingrad Oblast; now,

you tell me where it is; you should know and there was an intelligence

point there.

Tell me about it. ((Pause))

B. I do not know.

A. A man who has worked in the Intelligence of the Fleet, in Kalingradsk

A. I am not confusing you; you are confusing yourself.

B. I do not know, I do not know.

((XG; A and B speak at the same time.))

A. ...There

is

a Sovetsk; if you worked there, then you must know; now,

explain to me where it

is.

B. I do not know.

I am telling you that, in my memory... Sovetsk, Primorskiy Kray.

Why do not I see Sovetsk there?

Well, I had Primorsk in mind.

There... there... this place... here it is - not on the spit, but

before the spit....

A. If we consider that you were working... or that you held the position

of senior translator-interpreter of the Navy Intelligence Point... well,

I even will imagine for a moment that you were in Primorsk... then you

should know precisely that there is a Sovetsk and there was also a Navy

Intelligence Point there.

Even if you were not there, you should know this through correspondence-

because these points are connected somehow.

B. You do not have to tell memy fairy tales; please do not tell me tales.

Intelligence of the Fourth Navy Fleet, in August 1952 -- when I arrived,

had only one single point; if there were any others before that, then

they were eliminated.

There was one in Rostock, Sassnith, Sv inemunde

-- all of them were

shut down.

A. We will talk about Svinemunde and Sassnite -- you were there and then

you said that you had not been there.

If we have to, we can return to that question, also.

I cannot understand why you should be nervous.

B. Why nervous?

Because I am in prison; because all I can see is hooks, hooks, hooks,

hooks, hooks, hooks, and a great desire to make me out as guilty; Lord

knows, great accusations are being levied against me.

A. I do not want to make you out guilty; no one wants to -- you yourself

do this.

B. Only that way, only that way....

A. Well, how can it be believed, when for two years you were saying --

Sovetsk, Sovetsk, Sovetsk; 10 or 15 kilometers from Baltiysk; that is

all.

B. Very well; show me that map once more.

A.

I do not see any reason to do so; I do not want to show you Sovetsk.

We will come to it, and I will show you; I will bring you a large map.

Your statement that these intelligence points were eliminated -- even if

they had been eliminated, they were there, and it is an established

fact, and no one makes a secret of it.

B. What was there?

Where were they?

They had only one point.

A.

You tell me where.

If you say that there was one point, then you were not there - that is

what the question is about.

B. I have nothing to say to you, because I am telling you the way I

remember it, the way it was left in my head.

A. Well, you see, perhaps again you will say that I am putting out hooks

for you -- today you say, ... "The way I remember"; yesterday, you

insisted, that. "It was Sovetsk! that

is final!"

, and that you received

letters, "Sovetsk, Primorskiy Kray".

B.

Right, right.

A.

Today, we know that there is no Primorskiy Kray, and you were not in

Sovetsk.

Then, how am I to....

B. For me, for me... even though you showed me the map... for me --

"Sovetsk, Primorskiy Kray"; why?

I do not know, I do not know.

A. You know very well that in Moscow Oblast - ((there is)) Moscow City,

in Leningrad Oblast -- Leningrad, in Krasnodar Kray -- Krasnodar, in

Ryzan' Oblast - Ryazan', in Kaliningrad Oblast -- Kaliningrad;

there

never was a Primorskiy Kray there.

B. And maybe you are confusing me on purpose?

A. How?

How for example?

B. Well, give me that map; I will show you now -- because Sovetsk is near,

close to the sea.

A. ((Close)) to what?

B. Well, Sovetsk... well, where our MRP was situated, on the shore of the

B. I am applying all of the strength that I have left, although there is

only a little left.

B. Well, yes, here I have lost 30, 40, 50 pounds at a

time.

A. Well, I do not think that you think that I am to blame.

B. No, no, no; in no case do. I blame you personally.

A. Then, one of the reasons you have lost ((weight)) -- ((although)) you

((may)) have not lost - is that you have been saying that you were in

places where you were not:

B.

This is one of the wonderful reasons -- ((in English)) attitude.

A. I think it is much better than there,

B. I have not done time there; of course ((it is worse there)).... ((laughs)

A. Are you sure that you have not done time?

B. And to remember... as you wish... oh... I do not remember anything --

neither the Regulations, nor the Party.

I do not want to remember any Regulations.

A. I told you the last time that, if you do not remember your Party card

number, I would question where you were a Party member -- that is true;

I am telling you openly, and I am not hiding it.

B. Right, right -- becuase I have no proof; I cannot show my Party card.

If I showed you my

Party card, you would say, "Oh, you can write

whatever

you need" - that is why I never can prove anything to you,

if you do not want to believe...

A. I want to believe, but I cannot.

B. I never can prove it to you.

A. I want to believe...

Listen; do you really think that I only brought the Bol'shovt sovetside

Intsiklopediya to put you in a difficult position - for example, with

Sovetsk or Baltiysk?

I brought it for one purpose, and that was - to show you that you were

making an error; it is not the way you are saying it is.

If you had been in Primorskiy Kray, then my question would have been --

in the Far East, or somewhere else:

((XG; A and B speak at the Same time))

There was never a Primorskiy Kray in the Baltic area.

If you had made an error about some village (("Shory-Yery" -- i.e., an

imaginary "somewhere")), then I would not question it; but when it

comes to talking about a whole oblast -- which everyone knows about,

which was German territory, wich since 1946 after the death of KALININ

has been called Kaliningrad Oblast, but you call it Primorskiy Kray --

then,

for this reason alone, I have returned to this question three

times, and I brought the encyclopedia to show it to you; I did not

compile it ((the encyclopedia)).

B. One minute, one minute... maybe -- I do not remember - well, maybe

the letters were addressed, "Sovetsk By the Sea (Sovetsk primorskiy)"

or the devil knows what.

A. I do not know; you were there; I was not; but, wherever I was, I know

how I received letters.

B. I do not remember, I do not remember, I do not remember; think what

you will - I do not remember, as I told you.

A. It cannot be

so.

Again, you... perhaps you tried -- I do not know - perhaps you really

think that that is the way you wrote it -- "Sovetsk By the Sea"

like that; but if you look at the map, there is another Sovetsk.

Near Arkhlangelsk there is another Sovetsk, also, by the sea.

If you write "Sovetsk By the Sea", the post office will never find it;

there has to be something other ((than that)).

B.

I do not remember, I do not remember.

I do not know why I remember,

as I told you,

"Sovetsk, Primorskiy Kray"

I do not know.

A. One more little question - I want you to tell me more or less precisely

if you really were in the Baltic area, and for how long.

B.

I told you that I arrived there in August, and at

I went on leave.

A. Do you remember what you said earlier -- how long were you there, and

how you were there?

How do you explain the discrepancies.

B. I do not remember how much I said, what I said -- I do not remember.

A. Earlier, at one time, you said you were there more than a year; then,

you said you were there almost a year; then, 6 months; now, you say

you were there four and half months.

I want you to tell me for the last time whether you were there or not.

I was there, in the summer; I arrived approximately in August and was

there until the end of December; at the end of December, to my thinking,

I left for Moscow, in 1952... at the end of December 1952.

A. Well, what was interesting there, when you were in Kaliningrad?

What do you remember about Kaliningrad?

What kind of life was there at that time in 1952?

B. Well, I did not live there.

A. Surely you were there?

B.

Well, I passed through.

Perhaps one time I went there with the fellows for a drink on Sunday...

and when I was leaving.

A. Well, if you went for a drink, what particular thing might you remember?

What do the sailors usually recommend to drink in Kaliningrad?

B. I do not know, I do not know, I do not know, I do not know.

A. What is there?...

B. I drank vodka.

A. Did you ever go to the movies?

B. What -- do you think I was there in Sovetsk for years?

A. Well, if one is to believe that you were there for four and a half

months, you could not have spent all of your time at the base.

B. Well, I did spend all of my time there.

A. You were there day and night:

B. Yes, that is where we lived.

A. I understand that you lived there; on your days off, you must have

gone somewhere,

right?

You

just cannot

sit around like that all the time.

B. I do not remember; well, maybe... it seems we went to Zelenogradsk,

a resort town on

the coast.

We. stayed there ((at the base)) all the time.

Buy, anyway, you know - I think that I was right when I said Sovetsk.

Why?

Because this little town could not even be on the map, on that map; it

could not be; it is too small for this - there is no population there;

there is a little settlement.

I do not know why it was called "the city of Sovetsk,"

a settlement.

A. For your information - of course, there is in Kalingrad Oblast a city

called Sovetsk, but it is not a settlement and it is not a small town;

there are no other settlements by the name, Sovetsk.

B. I have in mind that Sovetsk which lies on the approach to the spit.

There is none -- that is my answer to that question, without even

thinking it over.

B. May I see that map once again?

for example, today you said, "Oh, not Sovetsk, ((but))

Primorsk."

B. No;

one minute -- do not say that, do not say that.

A.

Well, if I show you the map, you will say, "Ah, that was it; I made

mistake again -- it was not Primorsk", but you will say it is something

else.

Let us leave it just as it is.

B. You see... you see how you approach this question.

A. Well, how else can I approach this question?

You are smart enough!

As soon as I showed you; you immediately said, "I am sorry; I do not

know how I made the mistake. Primorsk."

When I told you that there is a Sovetsk and a Primorsk in Kaliningrad

Oblast, then later -- after 15 minutes -- you begin to think: "Neverthe-

less, this place is Sovetsk.

Such a little place -- I do not know why it is called a city.

Not another."

B. You show me a map; on this may this Sovetsk is not to be found; I

point out - here, here is the spit... Baltiysk; right there...

this

is Primorsk; if it is not Sovetsk; it means I was mistaken, that is all.

A. There is a Sovetsk.

I did not ask you to look at the map and say, "I am sorry; it was not

Sovetsk, but Primorsk."

I did not ask you about that.

If you were there, you should know; you should know Sovetsk, Primorsk,

Baltiysk, and Zelenogradsk.

B. As if, for the four months that I was there, I was traveling all over

the place, studying the map!...

It absolutely was not that kind of work.

A. Just for that reason alone, you should know that... if one is to

believe what you said, you were in Intelligence of the Fourth Navy

Fleet... for this reason alone, you must know.

If you had said another reason - that you were doing something else --

I would not even ask; perhaps you might not even have heard of these

towns.

But if you worked there, you must know - because all of these cities

had and have a direct relation to Navy Intelligence.

B. Why do you say that?

Intelligence is not counterintelligence; it isn't counterintelligence;

is not concerned with questions....

i

A. This is daily work, daily work; you do not necessarily have to be there

((to know about these places))... because you are sitting and working...

today, someone or other comes from a Navy unit; tomorrow, someone comes

from some other place... you go some other place for a couple of days,

and so on and so on..:

B. The fellows did not go anywhere except to Baltiysk; they did not go

anywhere.

B. But the tasks were changed, absolutely; there was only one task --

the preparation of agent-manned observation posts against the event

of war; that is all; there was nothing more; there was no agent work

at all.

A .

Well, if you are talking about work, I think we will return to it

in

little while.

If we are to believe what you said before, then you did not even say

anything about what you did in Intelligence there,

that you were

occupied with entirely different matters there.

Well, and it was because I was occupied with this, that I decided to

get out of the GRU.

A. Let us take a little break.

B. May I smoke!

A. Well, think it over a little... after our rather loud talk of today.

B. I only ask that you forgive me; maybe I... you must understand me as

man to man... maybe sometimes I get aroused, perhaps raise the tone of

my voice; well, please, do not pay any attention to it....

A. As I told you -- I am not angry at all.

A. I am not asking when KALININ died.

It is not necessary to remember, I would not ask another man this

question.

Inasmuch as you said that your father was a Minister, who held a high

position, etc., apparently he respected "grandfather" KALININ.

As you said, your father had many awards, etc.

You know that all people in high places in the Soviet Union, especially

in Moscow, and especially Ministers, receive their awards from the

hands of the President.

And before KALININ, Mikhail Ivanovich, died he, of course, shook hands

with your father.

And probably, when KALININ dies, your father said: "I am sorry etc...

the man died... He was President for a long time;

he was respected by

all, by those who like the Soviet Union and by those who do not like

the Soviet Union."

B. He was from peasant stock, a simple worker.

A. Well, if we look at it even from this point of view, it is possible

that there was a family conversation: "Thanks, that at least one thing

was done -- they named Kaliningrad Oblast in memory of KALININ".

B. I do not remember.

A. Well, I do not insist that it was that way, but it might have been.

B. I can tell you more - I knew his niece very well.

You told us that you traveled over the Soviet Union extensively, going

B. There was no reason -- only when I was at that MP.

A.

...Kaliningrad Oblast and so forth...

But everything adds up to ((the conclusion)) that your knowledge is so

small and you cannot confirm in any way that you had worked there.

You know absolutely nothing about it, even about the existence of

of Kaliningrad Oblast; I cannot understand this at all.

I can only say, speaking with a man who lived all of his life in the

Soviet Union, in Moscow and in other cities... and the ((Kaliningrad))

Oblast has been in existence since 1946... he makes such a mistake --

Primorskiy Kray - when it never was called that.

B. I do not know why in my memory...

I tell you that I remember:

Sovetsk, Primorskiy Kray.

But why?

The devil knows.

But I have in mind that little place at the very

beginning of the

spit, at the very beginning of the spit.

A. Of course, the spit is there; it has

not wandered off anywhere.

It still has not washed away; it was there, and it is still there.

But, of course, you must understand, it is difficult, quite difficult,

to believe that you were there, when you cannot say for sure where you

were.

B.

Well, I am

telling you where I

was.

A. You remember, of course, that you mentioned to me that Baltiysk formerly

was called Pillau....

B. Pillau - "this is the former Pillau."

A.

..And Sovetsk; you did not say exactly how....

B. I even do not know what it was called.

It was a German name.

A. Well, you did not tell me exactly what this was called.

You thought that formerly it was called so and so;

this means you have

in mind some town.

B. This Sovetsk had a German name.

It was a small, small fishing settlement, nothing more, aithough there

were several buildings.

The ton itself was ravaged.

Judging by everything, it was a large fishing settlement.

A. Well, after the death of Mikhail Ivanovich KALININ, the city of

Konigsberg was renamed Kaliningrad, on 4 July 1946.

The city, of course, is quite large.

But, of course, in 1945, there was almost nothing there.

B. It was wrecked - I remember the city

well - but the plant remained.

A. Do you remember - when you were there, what kind of newspapers

were

published there, and what kind of newspapers did you read

there?

B. Well, we read

our own paper, which was the Fleet newspaper.

A. What was it called?

B. I do not even remember the name.

In the Far last, it was called Na Strazha Rodiny (On Guard of the

Fatherland), but I do not know what it was called here.

A .

That, too, is quite strange.

B.

Well, I do not remember the name; I do not remember.

A. Well, what kind of newspapers did the Oblast Party Committee and the

Oblast Soviet publish?

A. I did not say that you lived there.

It is not necessary to live in Kaliningrad.

They send the newspaper all over the oblast,

B. We received the military newspaper.

We did not have to subscribe in order to receive the newspaper.

A.

Even if you go to the "Lenin Room", it could be there, on the tables;

B. Pravda, Izvestiya, laying there... and the Fleet newspaper.

A. Who was the Chief of Intelligence:

B. I do not remember; a colonel... I do not remember his name.

A. Whom do you remember from when you were there, from among the counter-

intelligence officers?

B. I did not know any of the counterintelligence officers; I did not know

one of them.

A. But you knew that they existed... or did you?

B. Well, in general, I knew -- there has to be a Special Department

A .

When you were there, did you ever have occasion to meet counterintelli-

B. No.

A. You know that most of the employees of the organs of the KGB... ((they

Komsomol members or Communists....

They have been, frankly, put on the hook — that is to say, recruited

into work for or cooperation with the organs - and then, many of them

he brought his wife.

DEMCHENKO was a bachelor, and lived at the base, as I did; then, there

was a lieutenant, a dark fellow -- he looked like a gypsy -- I do not

I remember no other names.

A. Did you live alone, or with someone?"

B. The lieutenant, also; I do not remember his name.

A. Well, then, it is as if to say you had no special friends.

B. I did not have any, because it was for a

A. Well, did not they give the son of a Minister a separate room?

B. Senior translator-interpreter of the Navy Intelligence Point.

B. Sovetsk, Sovetsk; it is Sovetsk.

A. You should think of something else, because there is no Sovetsk.

B. Well, I cannot tell you the name, but I remember it was Sovetsk, right

there at the end of the spit.

A. There is no Sovetsk at the end of the spit.

No Sovetsk is written near Baltiysk, or anywhere else there.

The old name could not be Sovetsk; and as its new name, it was never

called that.

B. The new name was Sovetsk.

A. I understand that it could be Sovetsk only under the new name -- because

it could not have been Sovetsk under the Germans.

But now I am faced with a dilemma, and there is a great question - let

us say that you came to this place, that you were assigned as a senior

intelligence officer....

B. A senior translator-interpreter.

A.

...Translator-interpreter at the MRP in the city of Sovetsk, several

B.

Well, maybe I am not telling you the truth; perhaps I am in error here -

but I tell you again that I remember "Sovetsk", and --. for some reason -

"Primorskiy Kray".

A. "Military Unit number so-and-so", then, probably the mail went through

the military field post office.

B. Well, because ((it was a)) military unit.

A. I suspect that it could not have been addressed to give the city, the.

street number, etc....

B. No street, nothing; no, no, no.

A .

If, let us say, there were other circumstances....

If you were an intelligence officer under civilian cover there, you

could have received

mail at a civilian address.

But, if ((you were)) at the MRP, I do not think ((the mail)) would

show. "City of Sovetsk, such-and-such a kray".

Probably there was only "Military

Unit..." and nothing

else.

B. I do not know why this is "Sovetsk" in my memory; I do not know.

A. Well, what were your duties?

You

arrived there as

a senior translator-interpreter of the MRP.

Imagine that

it was located somewhere on the spit, and you were there.

What was your job?

B. The point was set up just before I got there, before my arrival...

literally.

Before this, they were in Germany.

A. So.

B. I arrived, and the work here was purely of such... for everyone, officer

and all the soldiers….. the work was. simply outfitting the living

everything taken together....

We were concerned with purely housekeeping problems.

A. How much time did this take?

B. I do not know; I cannot answer outright; I do not know.

From the beginning, the point was faced with the usual problems.

In German, the permit was concerned with agent work; that is, they had

agents on commercial ships -- they had Soviet agents and also agents

from among the foreigners.

But here, there was absolutely no agent work; it was a new mission.

The point, Intelligence of the Fourth Navy Fleet, and probably the GRU

was changed with the creation, the preparation... rather, you could

say... the preparation of ANPS - Agent((-manned)) Observation Posts

(Agenturno-Nablyudatel'nyyeposty) against the event of war.

What was it, and how was it organized?

I personally did not do this kind of work, because I never had done

that kind of work; I had had no experience.

Furthermore, I had had no experience with agents.

I will tell you now, briefly, what it is and what I did.

Well, the officers -- BULAKH, YELISEYEV, and the others....

A .

Tell me only what you did; do not tell me what the other officers were

doing.

Tell only about your self, because we do not want to lose time talking

about other persons.

B.

But it was connected with what I did.

A.

Well, if it is connected with you, that is alright.

B. They selected people, from among the NCOs, the officers, sailors,

specialists, radiomen; then they organized groups of two and three men;

they checked the men who were ready to be discharged within six months

from the Navy.

B. ((Nervously:)) My tasks were, my tasks were; I held lectures about

the foreign policy of the Soviet State... about the fundamentals of

Marxism....

Besides that, when the mail was delivered to the military unit...

then,

the litters were delivered to our point....

I was, so to say, an administrative officer; I had such additional

functions - I brought the letters over, and asked what was needed --

razors, shaving cream,

etc.

So, so, so, so, so... I mean, supply.... because they were housed in

what

you might call safehouses.

A. And where were these apartments located?

B.

There were a couple in Sovetsk; there were... on the approach to

Baltiysk, in Baltiysk, in several places.

A. How were the men whom you supported dressed?

You brought them their letters, their personal effects, such as socks,

smoker's supplies...

B. They were dressed in civilian clothes; and they did not go anywhere -

they lived there for two or three months at a time without leaving.

A. And what were they doing there?

B. The officers - let us say, BULAKH -- ah... trained them in explosives.

YELISEYEV taught them how to collect intelligence data.

That lieutenant who was with me -- the tall, dark fellow who lived

with me - taught radio.

These were short 2-3 month courses.

was not ((i.e., could not have been)) your task.

B. This is the work they gave me; that is why I was disenchanted with the

What could I do there?

A. In the first instance, you seem to have been a political worker, but

when you say you delivered letters it looks as if you were Assistant

Chief of the Intelligence Point for Supply.

trained.

group,

there was

how many

hours,

including

mine - in foreign policy and Marxism.

Besides

that, there were

aids (posobiye)... just a minute...

there were

aids... these were supplied by the GRU;

they were

printed - not on a

the description of the cities, what there is in the cities, what

sights there are there, the streets, stores, etc., because each group...

each group was trained there precisely for dispatch to Denmark, Sweden,

Norway, in case of war.

A. Of course, the conclusion can be made that these groups were very

important and that the MRP was very important, inasmuch as they were

preparing agents.

they said that, as work, this was a joke.

This was absolutely new work; they had never done such work before.

As work, it was

a joke.

Why?

They trained these fellows for two or three months -- they do not

know anyone else - only these three.

One was the chief of the group; one was the radioman; and the other

was the explosives man.

After two or three months they returned to their military units.

The commander does not know where they

were.

The impression is

given that they have

been on

trip, and the

commander does not know

where they have

been for two or three months.

Then, they

return and

complete their service

two

or three months.

And thus

they already

have been trained;

then

they are demobilized

this is their regular

been trained, and they send him in some military unit.

Now, how and where can they find him?

This is a joke.

Of course not, absolutely not.
