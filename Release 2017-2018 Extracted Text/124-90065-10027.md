advised be is not acquainted with BOUZa,

MORALES, CORNILLOT of any of their associates and was

simply reporting information overheard by him on the above

occasion.

Although

claimed he was able to recall

without notes the names of all persons mentioned in this

conversation,

he was unable to recall these nanes at the

time of this interview and found it necessary to refer to

a copy of his written report to CIA for these names.

attention was directed to the fact he had furnished a bank

account number of RICARDO MORALES and he was specifically

asked if he had also been able to recall this number without

benefit of notes,

at which time he admitted this number had

been furnished by a "confidential connection" whom he refused

to identify.. He was obviously upset at being pinned down

as to the source of his information and attempted to explain

his refusal to identify his source by vaguely stating he was

a friend in the bank where MORALES had maintained his account,

which is not belleved to be true.

He denied his source was

OVIDIO KABA ACOSTA, stating he had never met abA.

In connection with the above, during previous

interviews with RICARDO MORALES, it was determined MORALES

had loaned his car to KABA while MORALES was in jail. In

the trunk of his car was a box of papers containing a passport

of BOUZA, erroneously issued under the name tamina Bout,

and in the locked glove compartment was a bank book showing

MORALES? bank account number which was known only to him.

MORALES also indicated during these interviews that he

had placed sports-type hub caps on this car just prior

to his arrest on 2/14/68, when the car was loaned to KABA

(note reference to sports wheels in enclosure). The car

Is & brown Pontiac sedan, purchased by MORALES in September,

1967, in the name of liMINA BOUts, his mistress. Although

the car is in her name, she has no driver's license and has

never driven it (note reference to her having transported

explosives and Cuban Power papers in this car). Since she

was unable to drive the car, it was loaned to KABA upon

MORALES® arrest.

During a subsequent interview with MORALES, he

advised he had obtained a confession from KABA to the effect

he had been

collecting and reporting information to a Cuban

exile, MARlO sIr, and it is now felt MASIP is probably

source.

stated he was positive of the date of the

above conversation as 3/16/68, a Saturday.

Regarding the

identification of the "tall and thin" female as IRMINIA

BOUZA, it is noted inquiry by Bureau Agents at the apartment

of BOUZA on the night of 3/14/68, in an attempt to locate

MORALES for interview, determined

MORALES had taken BOUZA-

to Mt. Sinai Hospital, Miami Beach, to have her baby.

was subsequently determined that she had a baby on the night

of 3/14/68 and remained in the hospital over the weekend.

on 3/16/68, as claimed by

she could not have been in the Camaguey Restaurant

This fact, along with

the 11logicalness of

story that he was able to

overhear and retain all names

and facts set forth in this

report and his subsequent evasiveness during interview,

leads to the conclusion his story was fabricated.

It would

appear this conclusion should have been reached by CIA also, (5) u)

report contains enough accurate information,

such as names

and account number of MORALES, to give it the

appearance of authenticity when the source or method of

in their memorandum the fact this information was hearsay

It would appear

En fact, advised ClAJof his method of obtaining(u)

this information, CIA deliberately omitted this point of

evaluation from their memorandun to the liani office, conveying lu)

the erroneous

impression the fatts emanated from a knowledgeable

source.

. A great deal of information sent to Miami by CIA

is attributed to "a group of Cuban emigres trained in the

techniques of information collection, " with no attempt at

identifying the origin of the information.

Apparently, CIA;

Miami, operates several such groups, some of which are more

reliable than others. In most instances, it is apparent no

U)

effort has been made

to evaluate the source or to determine

the identity of the original source of the information, causing

the Miami office to expend investigative effort in determining

the true facts... All such information furnished by CIA is (

given official character and weight by its being placed in

(u)

written inter-agency communication. It is felt street gossip

should be identified as such when included

in this type of

communication, particularly when this fact is readily known.

All other facts which would have a bearing on the veracity of

the source or truthfulness of the information should be ob

tained and reported by ClA, Jalong with the information being a 4)

It is recognized this is a delicate issue and as

stated in, retel of 3/26/68, this matter was discussed in-

formallywith CIA liaison, AUSTIN HORN, on 3/25/68, at which

time he agreed with these observations, stating he would

discuss the matter with appropriate personnel and attempt to

correct this situation in the future.:

И)

This matter was again brought up

oh. 4/2/68/when

the SAC met with PAUL HINZE, Chief of Station,

CIA, Miami.

HENZE stated his organization is not now operating

any

agents or informants, as such, in exile groups, and is not

engaging in any counterintelligence activities in the United:

States:

He stated his station is, in fact, cutting back its

operations, and many of the exiles they have previously used
