Twenty-three personnel files on people

named Roy Gibson were located. Without further identifying information

on the person of interest to the Committee it is impossible to tell

whether any of the files are responsive to the committee's inquiry.

other files were located. This letter also asked about logs of flights

by military aircraft at Camp Smith, Hawaii. Army records indicate that

during the time period of interest to the Committee the only aircraft

stationed at Camp Smith were helicopters, which lack the capacity to

travel any significant distances.

The logs of these local flights are

unlikely to be of interest to the Committee, but they can be made avail-

able if the Committee so requests.

General Wn. Westmoreland

Washington, D. C.

Dear General Westmoreland

Please forgive me for taking up your valuable time with

a matter that may be trivial.

However, I do not know

whether or not the matter should be investigated and.

hope that you can help me to decide.

This summer Hobert H. Doty, an ex green baret, stayed in

our home while he worked as a roofer here in Lubbock.

He mentioned you many times

so i felt that you might know

him well enough to evaluate this matter for me.

One evening on the news they reported the investigation

of the Kennedy assasination. Kobert seemed uneasy.

asked him what difference it made and ne said because

"I'm the man."

I was afraid to ask any questions. I could never tell

whether he das testing my reaction to a wild statement

or actually telling me the truth. I hope that you know

him well enough to decide whether or not this intormation

or statement should be given to the committee.

Thank you Ior your time.

Sincerely

Betty doe

A. REPORT OF FINDINGS

(C) During the period 28 January 1977 through 10 February 1977, George

C. Bloodworth, SSG, Plans and Training Division (P&T), Directorate of Operations,

66th Military Intelligence Group (MIG), Munich (PU9135), Federal Republic of

Germany (FRG), McGraw Kaserne (Barracks), APO New York 09108, was interviewed

on eight separate occasions, at his own request, concerning Helga Tismer, an

FRG citizen born 14 May 1946 in Wuerzburg (NA6817), FRG, the principal of

Subject investigation, and provided substantially the following information:

(C) At approximately 1800 hours, 27 January 1977, Tismer met Bloodworth

at his Bachelor Enlisted Quarters (BEQ), Apartment 4, Building 370, US Forces

Housing Area (USHA), Perlacher Forst (PF), Munich. Tismer remained at Blood-

worth's apartment until 0700 hours the following morning when she departed.

Source and Tismer planned to visit Austria for a skiing trip, but Tismer changed

her mind and tried to convince Source to accompany her to a commercial sauna

facility, not further identified (nfi), in Bad Toelz (PT9293), FRG. She commented

that she had friends in Bad Toelz whom Source would enjoy meeting but did not

mention the names of these persons.

Source agreed to accompany Tismer to the

sauna

the following evening, 29 January 1977.

(C) Tismer returned to Source's apartment at approximately 2030 hours, 28

January 1977 and again remained overnight.

She had previously agreed to meet

with Source at 1900 hours, at which time they would depart for the sauna in

Bad Toelz; however, her late arrival precluded their travel to. Bad Toelz that

They therefore made plans to go to the sauna the following night, 29

January 1977. Tismer apologized for being late, explaining that she had met

"someone important" after work (nfi) and this prevented her meeting Bloodworth

at the pre-arranged time.

Tismer changed the conversation from her tardiness. to

questions concerning Bloodworth's job.

The questions posed by Tismer were general

in nature and basically referred to Source's duty day, such as, "Did you have a

hard day?" to which Source responded that he had been required to attend several

meetings which prevented him from accomplishing much work. Tismer then asked

several questions concerning the meetings such as the type of meeting and who had

attended.

Source answered by stating that the meetings were job-related and the

personnel were essentially the same people with whom he worked. Tismer did not

ask anymore questions concerning Bloodworth's work at this time. She did, however,

reiterate an earlier request for a photograph of Source, preferably a picture of

him when he was younger.

Bloodworth considered this request to be especially

significant because of an incident which occurred in 1968.

A. REPORT OF FINDINGS

(C) Between August and October 1968, Source was a flight student at the

Us Army Flight Center (USAFC), Fort Wolters, Texas.

On one occasion during this

period (nfi), Source and his wife, Vivianne, visited a casual acquaintance at

this individual's apartment in Dallas, Texas, address not remembered. Source

initially met this individual at a Jewish seminar held at Fort Wolters and was

subsequently invited to visit him at his apartment in Dallas. Bloodworth

commented that although he knew that this individual was French he could not

remember any further identifying data concerning him at this time. During the

cited visit, Source and his wife accompanied the Frenchman to another apartment,

address unknown, of an unidentified elderly Russian couple (nfi) and introduced

Later in the evening, the Frenchman and Source's wife left the apartment

to purchase some items at a

local delicatessen (nfi), leaving Source alone with

the Russian couple. The Russian male prepared Source two cocktails mixed from

a powder which Source was told was 'Tom Collins mix. Source felt no effect from

the first drink; however, shortly after consuming the second, he became semi-

conscious and mentally confused as though he had been drugged. He recalled that

during this time the Russian couple asked him several questions concerning the

performance capabilities of US Army tactical aircraft. Source does not recall

the specific questions and in his confused state could not recall his responses.

When Bloodworth's wife and the Frenchman returned from the delicatessen, Source

insisted that they leave immediately. Because of his physical

tion, Source's wife was forced to drive from Dallas to Fort Wolters..

following morning Source related the incident to US Army Intelligence (USAI)

officials at Fort Wolters.

Approximately one week after reporting the incident

to USAI, Source was questioned by an unidentified special agent of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and once again provided the details of the incident

at the Russian couple's apartment. Several days later, Source was again contacted

by the special agent, who assured Source that he had nothing to worry about

because the individuals were already under investigation by the FBI. The agent

mentioned that the Russian couple was known to be acquainted with the wife of Lee

Harvey Oswald, the accused assassin of former President John F. Kennedy.

felt that this incident and Tismer's request for a photograph of him when he was

younger may have been related.

(C) Since 29 January 1977 was a Saturday, Tismer stayed with Source at his

quarters throughout the day until 1700 hours, when they departed Munich in his

privately owned vehicle (POV) enroute to the sauna in Bad Toelz. They arrived

at approximately 1800 hours.

The sauna facility was a health spa located in the

resort area of Bad Toelz called the Alpenmarle.

Source and Tismer stayed at the

sauna until approximately 2100 hours, then drove to the US Army Flint Kaserne

in Bad Toelz and went to the Non-Commissioned Officers' (NCO) club on post.

They

remained at the NCO club until approximately 2300 hours, then drove back to

A. REPORT OF FINDINGS

Source's quarters in Munich, arriving at about midnight. Tismer again remained

overnight.

At no time during the evening did. Tismer introduce Source to anyone

in the Bad Toelz or Munich area, nor did she pursue her previous line of

questioning concerning Source's job. At one point in the evening, Tismer casually

inquired what kind of work Source actually performed but Source ignored the

question and changed the subject.

Also while they were together that night Tismer

mentioned that when she was working in the US Army Hospital in Nuernberg (PV5079),

FRG, she had met a "marine" who was assigned to the US Consulate in Prague, CSSR.

At the marine's invitation she had traveled to Prague to visit him and he; in:

turn, had made trips to the FRG to visit her. Tismer did not identify this

individual or the period of time involved.

At 1200 hours on 30 January 1977,

Source drove Tismer to the Wienerwald restaurant located on Emerson Strasse, PF,

and left her there with the understanding that he would meet her again the

following day.

(C) During the evening of 30 January 1977, Tismer was confronted at her

apartment in the USHA by Source's wife, who threatened her with bodily harm if

she did not stop seeing her husband. Fearing for her safety, Tismer ran to the

residence of CPT Joan F. Sibrava, Building 302/B-2, USHA, PF, to seek refuge and

assistance. Sibrava is Tismer's sponsor, which authorizes Tismer to occupy

government quarters in the USHA. Tismer and Sibrava then went to the US Army

Military Police Station (MPS) on McGraw Kaserne, and requested assistance in

insuring Tismer's safety. Source, who was out of town with his children when

incident occurred, returned to his quarters later in the evening and found a

note from Tismer requesting him to contact her (EXHIBIT.

Source made no

attempt to contact Tismer that evening, intending to wait until the following day,

31 January 1977, when he had arranged already to meet Tismer for dinner.

However,

the following day Tismer telephoned Source at his office and related the incident

and asked him if there was anything he could do to keep his wife away from her or

if it was possible to have his wife transferred out of Munich. Tismer offered

that if Source's wife were out of Munich she and Bloodworth could meet each other

undisturbed. Source replied that there was really nothing he could do to prevent

his wife from going to her.

Tismer stated that she might be forced to go to LTC

Richard L. Scott, Äcting Deputy Community Commander, Munich Military Community,

to seek his help.

Tismer said that Scott was a personal friend and that she had

been a guest in his home in Bad Toelz and in his Bachelor Officer Quarters (BOQ)

in Munich.

(C) At 1800 hours on 31 January 1977, Tismer again met Bloodworth at his

BEQ:

Shortly after her arrival they drove

in Source's POV to the Gaststaette am

Perlacher Forst (Tavern in Perlacher Forst) located on Holtzendorffstrasse, Munich.

This establishment is also referred to as the "Flagpole" by US military personnel

in the Munich area. During their dinner at the tavern, Tismer revealed that

she might be pregnant, that she did not intend to have the baby but would

instead have an abortion. She told Source that she was telling him about

her possible pregnancy as a matter of personal interest to him, not because

of her intention to cause him any embarrassment or trouble. Source apologized

for having to cut their date short, stating that he had to return to his office

to finish a project which must be completed by 4 February 1977. This prompted

Tismer to state that if the project were that important the Army should grant

him an extension of his tour of duty for him to complete his portion of the

project were

project. The desire for Source to seek a three-month extension has been a

recurring topic of Tismer, who apparently hopes that Source will remain in

Munich for that additional time.

Source remarked that he might be able to do

some work on the project in his quarters.

This interested Tismer, who quickly

replied that she would be glad to help with the typing if Source wished. Blood-

worth said that this would be unnecessary because they had salaried secretaries

to do that work in the office.

The fact that Tismer is able to type did not

seem unusual to Source due to the various jobs she claims. to have held in the

In addition to having been a nurse

in Nuernberg (PV5079), FRG, and a

medical assistant in her present position, Tismer has mentioned that she once

was employed as an airline stewardess with an unidentified Greek airline.

(C) On 1 February 1977 at approximately 1800 hours, Tismer again met

Source at his BEQ. They had planned to meet at the Flagpole but Tismer said

that it was more convenient to meet Source at his apartment. Prior to Tismer's

arrival, Source had placed a copy of his most recent Officer Efficiency Report

(OER), DA Form 67-7 (EXHIBIT

), and a copy of US Army Administrative Survey

Detachment (USAASD) TECHINS 690-300 (EXHIBIT ) on top of a chest of drawers in

his bedroom.

He had then placed his hat on top of the documents in such a way

that he would be able to determine if the papers had been moved. Source had on

his own initiative taken these extraordinary steps in an attempt to determine how

inquisitive Tismer really was concerning his background. The OER described in

detail Source's current duties with the 66th MIG to include the fact that he was

a principal instructor of the 66th MIG Tactical Intelligence/Security Awareness

Team (TISAT) and that he had represented the 66th MIG at a major planning con-

ference at USAREUR Headquarters in Heidelberg (MV7773), FRG.

The OER praised

his job performance and

mentioned

his valuable assistance in the preparation of

the 66th MIG Readiness Test Standing Operating Procedures. Source's excellent

record as the principal instructor for the 66th MIG TISAT was also mentioned in

the OER, which described TISAT as an organization designed to provide presentations

to USAREUR tactical units. The USAASD TECHINS 690-300 concerned the application

procedures for personnel

seeking employment with USAASD. Although neither document

and duties with the 66th MIG and gave some insight into his aspirations to

remain in the employ of the US Government after his retirement from the Army.

During the course of the evening Source left the room to take a shower and

returning noticed that the documents had been moved. Tismer remarked that

Source seemed to be in a very good mood and asked why.

Source said that it

was because of an OER that he had received that day. Tismer pointed to the

DER on the chest of drawers and inquired if that was the report that he had

Source acknowledged that this was the report.

Tismer seemed

very interested in the OER and commented that Source had a very important job.

She asked Source what was TISAT; Source replied that TISAT was an organization

which presented briefings to US. combat troops. concerning the hostile threat to

Us Forces.

Tismer asked if TISAT was the unit to which SFC Gene Allen and CW2

Darryl Fallis were assigned. Source replied negatively.

Tismer next asked if

TISAT taught soldiers about the danger of loose talk to "bar girls, who might be

spies. "

Source acknowledged that this was a TISAT function, which prompted

Tismer to comment, "You must know all about how girls or spies get information."

"Not really" was Source's response.

Source mentioned to Tismer that the TECHINS

information on his bureau concerned the possibility of his finding a job with

USAASD upon his retirement from the Army. Tismer inquired about USAASD's function

and Source replied, "liaison work."

Tismer responded, "You mean like Van Buskirk?"

Source replied that he did not know the nature of Van Buskirk's work.

(C) Source told Tismer that when he and his wife separated she took most

of his savings, and, because of his present financial position, he would accept

any good-paying part-time job.

He mentioned having worked part-time as an

Assistant Club Manager in an NCo Club (nf1) in Belgium, where he became acquainted

with the practice of "skimming" profits from slot machines.

Source told Tismer

that although he had never been involved in these activities. himselt, he had

been approached by those who were involved and had been offered money for remaining

silent.

Here, Source hinted to Tismer that when not confronted by personal danger

he would enjoy making a little extra money.

(C) Tismer said that she wanted to visit a Gasthaus (nfi) in the Gruenwald

district of Munich in the near future. She told Source that "there were nice

people there," and they made plans to go there the following day, 2 February 1977.

Tismer told Source that he had been working too hard and needed a vacation and

should get out of Munich for a few days. Source replied that he must first

complete the project on which he was currently working, then

"the colonel" would

give him a few days off. Tismer remained overnight in Source's quarters, leaving

the following morning at 0700 hours with Source, who drove her to the vicinity of

her apartment in USFHA, PF.

A. REPORT OF FINDINGS

(C) At 1800 hours, 2 February 1977, Tismer again visited Source in his

quarters and remained overnight. During the course of the evening, Tismer asked

Source if his supervisor, Major

Ralph I. Ebener, P&T, 66th MIG, was an alcoholic.

Source replied that Ebener, who had joined Source and Tismer at the McGraw

Kaserne Rod and Gun Club (RGC) on several occasions, was "just like the rest of

Some like to drink more than others; and as long as you can do your job

there's nothing wrong with drinking." Tismer asked what would happen if drinking

did interfere with one's job, to which Source responded, "The Army has ways of

taking care of those kind of

people."

(C) Source mentioned to Tismer that a project on which he was working had

a suspense date of 7 February 1977, after which it would be delivered to Heidel-

berg. Tismer remarked that once the project was at Heidelberg, Source would not

have to be concerned about it.

Source rejoined, "No, that's just for their use.

Once I get back I'll have to polish it up for our use.

" Tismer queried Source

if he were planning to attend the local Fasching (carnival) party to be given by

the Bundeswehr Feldjaeger Battalion (FRG Armed Forces Military Police Battalion).

Source said that he did want to go but would have to work late on 4 February and

would not be able to get to the party until after 2200 hours. Tismer disclosed

that CPT Joan F. Sibrava, her sponsor for government quarters, would also attend

the party.

(C) Source mentioned that upon his retirement from active duty on 22

February 1977, there was a possibility that he would return to work for the US

Army in Europe as a civilian.

Because of his fluency in the French language,

Source speculated that he would be assigned to Brussels (nca), Belgium.

Tismer

said that she would like to join Source in Belgium and thought that she would be

able to find employment at any number of Belgian hospitals.

(C) On 4 February 1977, Bloodworth and Tismer attended the Feldjaeger

Battalion Fasching party held on Kronprinz Ruprecht Kaserne, Schliesheimer Strasse

in Munich.

Afterwards, they returned to Source's apartment.

As they entered

Source's BEQ building, Source saw two unidentified men in the lobby. After

entering Bloodworth's apartment, Tismer immediately returned to the lobby to

speak to the men seen on the way in. After a five minute conversation, she

returned to Bloodworth's quarters.

Source inquired about the identity of the

men and learned that one of the men was a Bundeswehr soldier.

Tismer said that

she did not know the other individual.

Source asked what Tismer had discussed

with the men in the lobby. She ignored the question and changed the subject.

Tismer spent the night in Source's quarters. The following morning as Source was

taking out the garbage he again observed the two unidentified men standing in the

lobby of his BEQ. On this occasion as soon as the men observed Source they

immediately walked down the first floor hallway and entered a room (nfi).

Source later noticed them drive from the parking lot in front of his quarters

in a yellow Fiat automobile with unidentifiable markings on both doors and a

ski rack mounted on the roof.

Source was unable to provide further identifying

data either on the two individuals or the car.

(C) On the evening of 5 February 1977, Source and Tismerate dinner together

at the Gasthaus Killer in Munich's Gruenwald district. After dinner Bloodworth

drove Tismer to her residence, where she remained while Source went to the RGC

on McGraw Kaserne.

(C) Tismer visited Source at his quarters on the evening of 6 February

1977 and told him that his wife had come to her (Tismer's) apartment. Wishing

to avoid a confrontation with Mrs. Bloodworth, Tismer spent the night in

Source's apartment. As they were leaving the building the following morning,

Source and Tismer were attacked by Source's wife. Source was able to subdue

his wife and allow Tismer, the primary target. of Mrs. Bloodworth's attack, to

flee the area.

In the struggle to control his wife, Source sustained superficial

cuts on his neck and hands.

Source noticed that his wife carried a weapon,

believed to be a can opener, wrapped in a piece of cloth. Once released by her

husband, Source's wife ran from the building, entered her car, and rammed Source's

POV twice before driving from the parking lot.

(C) Later Source learned from Tismer that following the fracas at Source's

apartment, Source's wife had driven to Tismer's residence and had physically

attacked her in the parking lot outside her quarters. The Military Police were

summoned and apprehended Mrs. Bloodworth, charging her with assault. Tismer

pressed charges against Source's wife with the German police, who contacted Source

on 7 February 1977 by telephone in order to ascertain his knowledgeability of

the incident.

(C) In a conversation that transpired sometime between 4 and 6 February

1977, exact date and time unrecalled by Source, Tismer again indicated that she

was hopeful source would extend his tour of active duty in the FRG or find employ-

ment at SHAPE Headquarters in Belgium. She reiterated an earlier comment that if

Source were to move to SHAPE Headquarters, she would be able to find a job in a

Belgian hospital.

Tismer also asked Source if he could cause the Army to return

his wife to the United States. Tismer mentioned that she had a sexual relation-

ship with an unidentified US Army Major at the time she was employed in Von

Steuben Hall on McGraw Kaserne. According to Tismer, the Major was a bachelor

Tismer and terminated their relationship, and, on the last occasion that Tismer

saw the Major, time unknown to source, the Major allegedly threw her down a

flight of stairs. Tismer stated that this individual was now in the United

States.

(C) Source recalled the following dialogue of a conversation between him-

self and Tismer which also transpired sometime during the period of 4-6 February

1977:

Tismer: Who are the guys that are doing the real action work in Munich?

Source: There are very few here. That probably goes on in Bonn or Brussels.

Tismer: What kind of action is that?

Source: Most countries have their own agents abroad.

Tismer: You mean Eastern countries have agents at SHAPE in Brussels?

Source: There may be as many as 2,000 in Brussels, Berlin, or places like

that. It's not my field.

Tismer: You mean you really don't know anything about this? Do you know

where those Eastern agents hang out in Munich?

Source: I have no idea.

(C) Tismer asked Source how his project was progressing and if it had been

completed. Source explained that only a few finishing touches were required and

that he had another two weeks to work on it. After completing the project, Source

said he would like to take a two or three day vacation.

Tismer suggested they

spend a three-day weekend together in Berchtesgaden (UN4977), FRG.

(C) Source voiced the opinion that after his departure from Munich, Tismer

may try to develop a relationship with his supervisor, Major Ralph 1. Ebener.

Tismer has asked Source questions concerning Ebener's personal. life and is aware

that Ebener is Source's supervisor and may, therefore, be knowledgeable of the

project on which Source has been working.

Tismer has herself met Ebener on

several occasions at the Munich RGC on McGraw Kaserne.

information concerning Tismer or related personalities. His cooperation has been

entirely voluntary in this Detachment's pursuance of the SAEDA investigation.

Also, Bloodworth has never received instructions to pass any kind of information

to Tismer or other individuals.

Because of the nature of Bloodworth's cooperation,

lack of detail in his reporting have been necessarily accepted. Chuck is believed

to be 2LT Charles Mckee, assigned to the Command Section, 66th MIG.

4. REPORT OF FINDINGS

1/5. (5) On 2 May 1977, a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) report, dated

(MIG, McGraw Kaserne (Barracks), Munich (PU9135),. Federal Republic of Germany

(FRG), APO New York 09108, which occurred in October 1958 while he was assigned

to Fort Wolters, Texas. The review of the FBI report revealed substantially

the following pertinent information:

(S) On 3 December 1968, George C. Bloodworth and his wife, Viviang Astrid

Bloodworth, nee: Hayoun, who resided at 516 Southwest 17th Street, Mineral Wells,

Texas, were interviewed by a Special Agent of the fBI. Bloodworth, then a

Warrant Officer Candidate, was assigned to the l0th Warrant Officer Candidate

Company, US Army Primary Helicopter School, Fort Wolters..

(S) Bloodworth stated that on 5 October 1968, he and his wife met Alexander

Kleinlereraat an unidentified Jewish Synagogue in Fort Worth. Bloodworth and his

wife accompanied Kleinlerer to his apartment located at 3542 Kent Street, Fort

Worth to give Kleinlerer various unidentified articles, which he was to deliver

to Mrs.: Bloodworth's mother who resided in Paris (nca), France, while on a

business trip (nfi).

(S) Upon their arrival at Kleinlerer's residence, Bloodworth and his wife

met George Bouhe and Lydia Dymitruk.

Bouhe allegedly resided in Dallas, Texas

and Dymitruk resided in the apartment next door to Kleinlerer's apartment. Later

that evening, as Bloodworth and his wife were preparing to depart Kleinlerer's

apartment, Kleinterer told Mrs. Bloodworth that a good delicatessen was located

near his apartment and Mrs. Bloodworth would be able to purchase food items which

she would not ordinarily be able to find in "this country"

....At Kleinlerer's

suggestion, he and Mrs. Bloodworth went to the delicatessen to purchase some of

the food prior to Mrs. Bloodworth and her husband's return to Fort Wolters.

George Bloodworth, who was having a drink, remained at the apartment with Bouhe

and Dymitruk.

(S) Bloodworth became engaged in general conversation with Bouhe and Dymitruk

Bouhe asked Bloodworth about his duty in the Republic of Vietnam. Bouhe further

asked Bloodworth his opinion concerning the US commitmentato Vietnam. During the

conversation with Bouhe, Bloodworth stated that he had served in Vietnam as a

"gunner" on helicopters. Bouhe then asked Bloodworth questions concerning the

types of helicopters used by the Us and the armament capabilities of these

helicopters.

Bloodworth initially thought Bouhe might have been an Army Intelli-

gence Officer, and was testing Bloodworth's security consciousness, and therefore

Bloodworth was very careful in answering Bouhe's questions. However, Bloodworth

also believed that Bouhe was possibly a foreign intelligence officer, although

Bouhe gave Bloodworth no indication of this, either by action or word.

Only

Boune asked Bloodworth questions. During lulls in the conversation, Bouhe and

Dymitruk conversed in the Russian language.

(S) Kleinlerer and Mrs. Bloodworth returned to the apartment approximately

30 minutes after they had departed. Upon their return to the apartment, the

conversation drifted off to normal conversation.

Bouhe observed a radio in the

apartment and asked Dymitruk why Kleinlerer had to purchase a new radio when the

lone that he had given Kleinterar would receive Moscow.

Because of the conversa-

tion, Bloodworth became suspicious of Bouhe, and as such felt that the conversa-

tion should be reported. Bloodworth believed that the answers to the questions

asked by Bouhe could have been obtained through the news media

and aviation

magazines, and may have been used as a lead-in for later questions. Bloodworth

and his wife were invited to visit Bouhe in Dallas, but had not done so at the

time of their interview by the FBI.

(S) Based on information provided by Bloodworth, the FBI conducted investi-

gations concerning Dymitruk, Bouhe and Kleinlerer. The results of the FBI

investigation are summarized below:

(S) A coded government agency which conducted security type investigations

revealed to the FBI that Lydia Dymitruk was born on 3 April 1926 in Rostov (nca),

JUSSR.

In approximately 1942, she was deported by the Germans to a work camp in

When the war ended, she entered a camp for displaced persons in

Duesseldorf (L84577), Germany, where she met and married Karel Lodwijk Verhelst,

a Belgian citizen (nf1): On an unknown date, she entered Belgium with her husband

and resided in Antwerp (nca), Belgium.

She was alleged to be a member of the

Union of Soviet Patriots in Belgium from 1948 to 1952.

In 1952, while still

married to Verhelst, she began living with Vasiliy Gavrilovich, also known as

Pavel Kostenko, in Brussels (nca), Belgium. She was divorced by Verhelst in

and continued living with Gavrilovich until late 1954 or 1955.

Gavrilovich was allegedly born on 5 September 1922 in Tula (nca), USSR. He served

in the Soviet Army in World War II prior to joining the "Vlassov Forces" in

fighting on the side of the Germans against the Soviets.

a large beard which covered most of his face, 35 years of age, approximately 70

inches in height, 180 pounds, and very friendly toward everyone at the congrega-

tion. The unidentified man seemed to know almost everyone in the congregation.

Bloodworth could provide no further information concerning this individual.

Kleinlerer was immediately attracted to Bloodworth and his wife when he learned

that Mrs. Bloodworth's mother resided in Paris.

A. REPORT OF FINDINGS

Kleinlerer and Mrs. Bloodworth then went to a delicatessen to purchase some

items, and were absent from the apartment approximately 45 minutes.

this time Bouhe and Lydia asked Bloodworth numerous questions concerning the

types of helicopters in use by the US and about the armament capabilities of

these helicopters.

During the questioning, Bouhe and Lydia also engaged in

conversations between themselves in a language other than English. In response

to Bloodworth's questions, they informed him that they were speaking in the

Russian language. Bouhe asked Bloodworth what he thought about the Vietnam War

and how long he thought it would take before the war ended. Bloodworth thought

it strange that two civilians would be asking questions about helicopter armament

and only answered their questions when he knew the information was unclassified

and could be read in any aviation magazine or newspaper. Bloodworth was not

questioned about his background. Bloodworth overheard Bouhe and Lydia talking

about two radios that were located in the apartment. Lydia stated that Kleinlerer

had bought another radio and Bouhe immediately asked why, because he (Bouhe) had

given Kleinlerer a radio that would receive "Moscow." Bloodworth noticed two

radios located on a table in the rear of Kleinlerer's apartment, however could

provide no positive identifying data on the radios because they were encased.

When Kleinlerer and Mrs. Bloodworth returned to the apartment, Bouhe stated

that he knew some French and Tunisian people residing in Dallas whom he would

like Bloodworth and his wife to meet. Bouhe wrote his name and the phone number

TAl-3244 on a piece of paper and gave it to Bloodworth, stating that Bloodworth

and his wife should visit him in Dallas.

the FBI received an inquiry from the Immi-

gration and Naturalization Service

shortly thereafte" (INS), to determine if Bouhe was in any way

connected with subversive elements.

The results of the INS investigation were

not indicated.

The INS inquiry indicated that Bouhe was born on 24 February

1904 in St. Petersburg (nca), Russia, and was naturalized as a US citizen in

and Marina Oswald.

Bouhe stated that he had read of Oswald's return from the

Soviet Union in 1962, in a Fort Worth newspaper, and expressed an interest in

meeting Marina Oswald because she might have been from his area of Russia. A

man named Gregory, not further identified (nfi), had invited Bouhe to a dinner

for Oswald, where Bouhe became acquainted with the Oswalds.

the Oswald's apartment and found that they were almost destitute. Bouhe pro-

vided the Oswalds with groceries, baby clothes and a baby crib.

Bouhe did not

see Oswald after December 1962.

Bouhe's name appeared many times in the files

of the Oswald case because he was an

acquaintance of Marina and Lee Harvey Oswald

and because of his having been born in Russia.

1963 to determine the reason for his recent trip to Mexico. He explained the

trip as a vacation to the satisfaction of the FBI.
