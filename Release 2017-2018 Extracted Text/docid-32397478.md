So, jou con sea that Davis, even though his theioric may be & bit

as thites, and so one oi the positions of the Communist Party mem-

bers tres to support nagons in the black causus and anywhere else in

the convention who wanted to change that numerical system: I, my-

self, did not get to go to the final meeting at which the black caucus

voted, you hoow, on the spacides, but I was there when they came bach

to the convention, baccusa they hed lein and there was some siange.
