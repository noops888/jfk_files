CONTACT REPORT:

PARTICIPANTS

PETUNIA; CHALEMSKY

PLACE & TIME:

Metro Dupleix; 8 July 1445; Cafe Batavia, 1445-1730

NEXT MEETING : Cale Batavia, 1730, 9 July

KEYPUNCHED

1. Contact established, eventho PETUNIA was standing on the wrong side of the

metro station and got his

part of the recogition phrases wrong.

Explained that he

had been busy on the 3rd and thought it better to stay where he was than to leave

to meet CHALEMSKY.

Had prepared notes on his contacts (had had initial difficulty

in finding anyone, finally called Susan George and get reintroduced into the circie).

Lary coX:

Cox runs a hang out in Pantin fox deserters, SDS activists,

resisters and casuals passing through Paris, address is 3, r. Gabrielle Jasseranc

In Pantin [Paris suburb - this address figured in an UNDERBID report on the

arrest of some desarters for possession of drugs].

Did not know how long this

house has been in operation; rent is 1200 frs/mo [$240.]. Cox spends a lot of

time making the contributions circuit to raise money to pay for the house - mentioned

having got $100 from Sartre, some money from de Beauvoir (no figure mentioned) and

1500 frs from Gatherine Deneuva [movie actress]. Cox also gets support from Resist

in the States and is now negotiating with Resist to get them to pick up the montily

rent as a form of support.

(No names mentioned in this context.) Also gets some

very nodest support from the Monthly Review, most of it in the form of books and

periodicals for their political use (and presumably, sales - 1f possible). Mike

Spiegel of National SDS was in town this lest year, Cox said (no date.)

and said he

would try to get them support from the States.

Cox himself first came to Paris to take French lessons prior to

assigument somewnere in Africa with one of the church-identified international

voluntary service organizations. After 6 mos of language, he decided that he wanted

to remain in Paris and proposed to his sponsors that he be allowedto work here

anong deserters and draft resisters %the letter of proposal described this in social

work terms,. but Cox said he didn't hide what he planned

to do and in fact let his

sponsors know; he didn't expect them to approve it):

The group in effect turned

their heads to the political implications of cox' work, and agreed to let him stay

in Paris on salary ($240, nonth); they asked for monthly reports, which he has not

sent them.

Of his $240, he contiibutes $40 to the

food budget of the house.

There are 20 deserters/resisters who live in the house, and

PETUNIA described them as a bunch of apolitical bums..

Most of the good, politically

minded deserters work in France to save money to buy false documentation

and passage

to Canada, then leave.

Those who remain behind aren't interested in politics and

aren't capable of nuch.' From one sirl who hangs out with this group he got various

anecdotes of life among the deserters:

one sends letters to Mao Ise-tung informing

him that 1000 men in Canada, 15,000 in Alaska and others in France who are preparing

to take over the US and are

In training at the moment ("math class from 9=10

mooning") and asking Mao to send some divisions to help the invasion;

on a starvation diet and saved every penny he could find (to buy his way

France), then tent off and bought a monkey ($40); another always pulls a knife on

impression that this was undez false documentation (which can be bought for $300.):

(No names or hinüs of where one can get this documentation.)

Everyone désplays the usual paranoia on

the subject of CIA.

and others are positive that there is an agent in the house; they are very suspicious

of each other and play games tuying to trip each other up.

They claim that within

24 hours after a deserter has arrived in France, the Embassy knows everything

Cox has a Swiss fiancee who plans to Join him soon in Paris; she

is studying educational psychology in Geneva with an i/i professor there who Cox

about to set off. a revolution in this field.

They both want to go to the

States, and Cox talked about going there when she finishs in Geneva.

He wants to

work in a factory and get Involved in organizing within the movement.

Since he has

refused induction 3 times, he expects legal

action to be taken against him when he

returas (and wondered whether'they' would also get him for aiding and

desertion within the army). He described his major work here as dealing with

deserters and resisters, trying to educate them and get them involved in

and in working with GIs in Germany, encouraging them to desert.

A few GI's on R&R

have stayed at the house in Pantin

Cox made a trip to Sweden last winter (by microbus), and

Said nobody likes Sweden (lousy weather, no work, lousy

people eventho they get a warm reception).

2. Ed DUBINSKY:

Former nath prof at Tulane (got fired for taking part in some

protest - on the racial issue?).

Was in Warsaw earlier this summer for an

nternational mathenatician".

abridge and then to Canada weze he has a job offer (in Sontreal

FAM LINES

in Harsaw, met a Polish woman (age 32, Andreajea B; married, three children;

former funcationacy of the PZPR but forced out because of Jewish origins), and

he is considering marrying her.

She has asked him to come back to Warsaw

and

He mentioned a strong possibility that he would be invited to teach

do research at the Univ of Warsaw (apparently something of a center for higher

math), and said for personal and professional reasons he'd love to go - this

would be sometime around 1970/71.

Thinks of living

in the UK or Israel with

Dubinsky was quasi-invited to

a meeting here with the Viets, which is why he was in Paris.

Before leaving

the States he got letters of Introduction from Robert Greenblatt and Mel seek

Rothenberg to Mme Than Van Phaw.

Dubinsky had been contacted by Dubinsky

about a meeting of nathematicians with the Viets "to discuss the state of

higher math in Vietnam and life in general" [this apparently said with a straight

face!], which he billed to PETUNIA as an apolitical meeting "to prepare for

American-Viet relations after the war".

Dubinsky was supposed to meet Greenblatt

in Paris, but he can't find himad can't find anyone who knows him...so he's

taken to sitting in cafes in hopes Greenblatt with walk past!

If Greenblatt

and the meeting don't show up soon, he's going to leave for Cambridge.

reluctant to contact the Viets directly despite the two letters of introduction

since he says he'd not give the time of day to anyone who just appeared at his

door - wich or without letters.

[His position was reinforced by Susan George,

Who agreed; George added that she didn't know Than Van Pham.]

3: Martha BULIMAN:

Met on 20 June (address: 4, ave. Hoche; tel CAR 42-84).

her father John. Hess had just written a book on De Gaulle and his foreign policy;

was rather proud of his father.

Said "ny. father would be considered to be

extreme leit in the US, but actually he is cautious if even a conservative in

many ways."

Said her parents were zuzily very suspicious and had always told

always to be careful since you never could tell when someone works for the CIA.

Described her father as having a tremendous amount of knowledge about a great

many things, wnich is reflected in his writing.

he can easily argue an opposing

viewpoint, and does in social conversations for the fun of it.

They travel a

good deal,

using Paris as note.

Last year, her parents went to Amsterdam and

Switzerland and are planaing to go to Amsterdam again.

Hess started out in

Latin America,

twenty or so years ago. At one time he worked in Cuba making

cigars or something (PETUNIA:

Martha commented:

that's a direct quote!); speaks Spanish perfectly.

"of course he is very sympathetic toward radical youth and the

revolutionary noverent in general, but has a critical spttit."

He supposed to

be very strict about not Imposins on people he knows, and would never send one

friend to contact another.

Had dinner one night (apparently recently); with

Mary McCarthy and husband

(chez Hess). Coumeated McCarthy Is very bourgeoise;

her husband is quiet and looks like Clay Shaw.

McCarthy feels that the NVNese

have handled their propaganda rather badly on the war, and Hese agreed

Martha 1s syspathetic towerds the deserters and resisters

In Paris, says there are 13 or 14 who are the real cormitted ones, but

60 who are in the Paris

"novement group'.

McCarthy apparently has pretty

good contact with the novement,

said that she'd mentioned Cox's nane once.

and is at least in contact with some resisters;

Martha works for SDS in New Orleans, but is tired of their

rhetoric; she can't stand PIP peopie. Mentioned Sue Munaker (another PETUNIA

contact) had written a 40 page essay on the lomen's Liberation Novement to

be published in some forthconius bock on the student left.

Martha knows

Dublasky.

Susan GEORGE:

Net Susan George on 24 Jure (address 42 I. du Cherche-lidi;

phoze Lumber LIT 48-01)• Discussed banning of PACS last October:

she

said the

leader of the MDPL, (Claude Bourder) suggested that PACS members joined the MORe;

theor had been no little hesitation after the French had tossed Croyell out but

people were now gravitating coward the MiPhwhich is composed of individuals

from almost every political grouping. The MPL's basic issue is of course

Vietnam, though at base the movement is colmitted to an anti-imperialist, anti-

capitalist position.

George described it as a very flexible organization with

no structused leaders or administrative comittees so ha it can avoid the

bureaucratic indecision of old PACS leadership groups.,

MDPL members are

developing "political consciousness" and have passed the point of regarding

the Vietzam war as just a 'mistake'.

George, herself, was working at the American College it in

the Registrar's office; said there were about a half dozen radicals in the

College, she knows them and is sympathetic toward their efforts. Claims the

schools administrator is a "paranoic dictator".

She resigned after the

principal of the school accused hez of "conspiratorial counsellag".

done translating work, but paû prefers more

"active" and less "confining"

jobs. She has received an advance from Beacon Press to write a book on

Americans deserters in France.

When PETUNIA asked her where he income really

came from, she replied thit she lives off her husband!

The tone of the conversation with her, PETUNIA commented, was

very pro-wese; she said they have offered "magnanimous gestures to work with

the Añerican people after the was is over".... Feels that they are handling

the war and the negotiations brilliantly.

She frequently sees

"her Vietnamese

friends", and they have told her they are very satisfied with the progress of

the struggle and its certain ouscome.

Mentioned that she would see her friends

the next day to get their reactions/approval to a circular prepared for

distribution advertising the 4 July neetisg.

Also said she had just talked

with her friends last night about the meeting. and was sure that they would

approve the circular.

she made a tape for Pacifica Corp on "the war and

resistance, you know...'

• said that a Paris law student nic is giving legal

help and draft counselling to resisters in Paris (!); same not mentioned.

said that last year she was mostly tied up with PACS and didn't work with

"Marxist Studuy Groups"... Plans to go to the US in August to visit her mother.

Whize in France, he has been living

off cich old women. Was living in the ADC house in Pantin but got thrown

out because he was an acid-head and was bringlag pot home.

the money for the deserters' house and contributes to their funds.

to stay in Paris and is thinking about going south for a while; mentioned

that "we" have a couple of colonies in Toulouse.

6. Maria FOLAS:

Met on 2 July.

Jolas asked about the movement in the States

and concluded that the radicals can't afford to bicker like children (with

reference to the SDS/PLP split.

Said she thought the Ph position with respect to

the NVNese and the war was ridiculous - made no other comments on the American

Said that what happened to "Max" was regrettable, but that

his tactics were deplorable.

He virtually snubbed his nose at the French

Said that she felt the Americari novement had largely forgotten

the war and that more work against the war was being done in Paris than in

Mentioned the Paris movement was pretty well coordinated and ready

to go with coordinated demonstrations to tine with those held in the US, last

fall, but the MOB simply failed to keep in touch with them. Said that this

was no fault of Dave Beillinger's, whose credentials were impeccable, but he

does need an orgenizational secretary behind hin.

Nevertheless, she lamented the

fect that mony people from the old PACS were frightened away after the French

bzaned it (afzaid of losing passports or being rossed out), and not everyone had

joised Bourdet's dutfic.

7. Anti-Vietnam Neetzags:

Os 24 juae,

a group collected at Claude Bourdet's home to use his

address file to send out invitations to the 4 July meeting.

Bourdet's address

file comprises approximately 1,500 naues and addresses; Bourdet commented that he

had a separate file for French communist pacty members.

Working at the meeting

were Susan George, Dean Savage, Ralph Fischer and Elizabeth INU [Adler?]. Fischer

Sarage is a physics teacher at * JI. College in Brooklyn; visiting Paris.

is married to a Yugoslav girl; he writes for the Guardian, about 25 years old,

clean shaven, bright but cold.

On others, see above.

On 3 July, another group collected to work up posters for the

maetingo

Involved then were: Cox, Dubiasky,

Elizabeth INU, Susan George, Jolas,

a deserter, a resister and 2 girls. No sames

for the latter four. PETUNIA

picked up the info that the deserter was fron Vietnam, he held a factory job,

his father is a good friend of Westmoreland's.

On 4 July, the meeting took place: it alternated

speakers and

texts: one hour, someone

read the names of American war dead; second hour,

someone read fron texts provided by the Vietnamese.

On the latter point,

was a last minute change of tactics by the Viets.

The original idea had been

a political wake for the American dead and for those in Vietnamese villages

bombed by the Americans.

Thus:

the names of the war dead and the names of

bombed villages would be zead out.

At the last moment, the Viets told Susan

George that the nanes of bombed villages had non "political significance"

instead they'd rather the meeting read aloud from material marked in red by

the Viets.

George want along with the idea, though Jolas anong others didn't

like it since it altered the purpose and impact of the meeting.

the Viet alteration was accepted.

Very few people attended the 4 July meeting;

PETUNIA wasn't impressed at

all.

Everyone signed two books open in the back

of the room:

one called for an

end to the war; a second was a piedge of support

to the Viets. Evezyone signed, and the Viets took this book back with then.

Three Viets appeared during the day, sat quietly in the back of the room and

said little to anyone other than themselves, and left not long after they'd

arrived.

One of the three returned that evening to collect the signature book.

After the meeting was over at midnight, everyone went their separate ways.

8. Julla Herve-latgat

Anecdote from Dublasky.

Later he heard

frou baigbtcherve that his friend had been the one who killed Richard Wright.

Dubinsky dia not mention the name, but said the episode is described in the

béography on Wright.

He at first refused to belleve Julla Herve's

assertion

but later became convinced of it.

His friend never denied the guilt, and

did admit to being a CIA agent.

Wright was killed by the CIA because he had

just finished a manuscript on the use of American blacks abroad by the

goveriment.
