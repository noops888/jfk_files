Reference is made to your memorandum of September 2*, 1960,

in which you requested to be advised whether the facts developed

warrant prosecution.

The report enclosed with your memorandum reflects that

Julio Fernandez Trevejo, who described himself as a very close

associate and confidant of Masferrer, furnished the following per-

tinent information concerning the twenty seven man invasion force

which landed in Cuba in October 1960, under the leadership of

Armentino Feria Perez.

Masferrer acted as counsel and adviser in

the preparations of this

group and was in charge of handling the men

who were to go on the expedition.

Four boats were utilized in the

operation. The "Aladino," piloted by Horacio Canizares Padron, was

scheduled to rendevous with the "Sunsport," piloted by Frank Joseph

Williams, at Mira Por Vos, about sixty miles north of Cuba. At this

point, the "Aladino" was to pick up the men, supplies, arms and nec-

essary equipment for the expedition to invade Cuba.

The "Sunspoit"

was to transport the fuel for the "Aladino" to make the trip from Mira

Por Vos to Cuba and return. The "Mary Ann" piloted by Santiago Alvarez,

was to transport the men from Miami-to an island in the Bahamas about

one-half way to Mira Por Vos. A fourth boat, piloted by an individual

known only as Cartaya, was to transport the arms, uniforms and equip-

ment to an island somewhere in the Bahamas, approximately midway between

Miami and Mira Por Yos.

Masferrer knew that arms and ammunition were

to be transported on one of the boats and all the persons involved knew

they were to embark on a military expedition. At this point, Fernandez'

statement is non-specific concerning details but apparently all four

boats did participate to some extent in the invasion. Fernandez made

available a book which reflected the contributions received and monies

disbursed for this expedition.

Masferrer advised on December 6, 1960, that he was partially

responsible for this expedition.

He stated that the members thereof

were organized in the United States with the knowledge they were to

embark on a military expedition against Cuba. He explained that Santiago

Alvarez transported the arms on his boat the "Mary Ann" to a location

in the vicinity of Gun Key in the Bahamas for this expedition. It is

noted that Alvarez, upon being interviewed on October 10, 1960, advised

that he did not possess any pertinent information concerning the in-

vasion force which departed from Miami on September 26, 1960.

It is our present intention to send two Departmentar attorneys

to Miami to present this entire matter before a grand jury the early

hpart of next week. It is anticipated that these attorneys will arrive

determine whether

In the meantime, it is requested that you

Williams, Jullo Tamandez and Evello Alpizar

would be willing to testify in the event prosecution were undertaken

against Masferrer under the neutrality statutes. It is also requested

that you attempt to interviewthe individuals identified by Fernandez

and listed above concerning their own and Masferrer's participation in

the organization of the expedition of September 26, 1960, as well as

their willingness to testify.

We noted that the report of Special Agent James D. Hayes dated

November 17, 1960, set forth information concerning the establishment

at No Name Key, Florida. We noted that seventeen of

the individuals on No Name Key were interviewed and each advised they

had gone there voluntarily and without compensation.

They explained that

for the most part they were in dire financial straits, and in addition to

getting into good physical condition, they were able to live without any

expenses. All expenses were presumably paid by Masferrer or his associ-

ates and these individuals advised that they were not presently aware of

the existence of any plans for the formation of an invasion or expedition

against Cuba.

A physical inspection of No Name Key by Bureau agents

failed to disclose any firearms.

However, we also noted that an article which appeared in the

"Washington Post and Times Herald" on December 26, 1960, indicated that

23 Americans and 200 Cubans from Miami and New York, commanded by

Masferrer, were making final preparations to invade Cuba.. If this in-

formation can be established by competent available evidence, a prosecution

for violation of 18 U.S.C. 960 may be warranted. Accordingly, it

Is requested that investigation be continued in

this regard.

In the interest of expediting this matter before the

grand jury it would be appreciated if the Bureau would furnish the

results of their additional investigation to the Departmental

attorneys in Miami as it becomes available.
