existence from 1966 to 1909, one of its chief sources of

income was

the proceeds fron criminal acts perpetrated by

indivioual menners who split with the Party.

More recently,

the chies source of

funds

for the BPP has been numerous and

regular contributions from individuals, radical groups and

sympathizers in the United States and overseas.

These

individual contributions have increased greatly since

UNDERGROUND PUBLICATIONS

The lew Leit relies heavily on printed propaganda.

The New Left has an enormous propaganda mill churning out

publications doneaning the "Establishment" and glamorizing

the "rebols." There are over 200 New Left underground

newspapers publishedon a regular basis in the United States.

The contral theme which pervades these papers is a

morbidly

curicus who may be intrigued by the activities of the

in be at tea

New Left. Also featured are obscene photographs and

psychedelic drarings.as well as announcements of interest to

sex deviates and

hallucinatory drug users.

Youth, particularly

students, are the main target of these publications, which are

effective vehicles for agitation and recruitment in that they

reach a lnrge portion of the student population.

For the most part, the underground

papers are in

poor financin), condition and often miss publication dates due

to a lack of funds.

Papers circulated in large urban areas

are usually solvent, while those in university communities

are struggiing to keep in business.

Generally, funds are

received son advertising, subscriptions, donations, and

benefits. Volvuteer labor is used in most instances.

Attanpis by New Left leaders to unite these

underground payers into some type of network have been unsuccess

ful to date, sinos there are no concrete political philosophies

agreeable to =3?.

While the edisors share similar goals, they

diverge widely as to the means.

However,

over 100 underground

papers are affiliated with the

radical Liberation News Service

which provides nous packets concerning New Left activities.

In a few instances, authorities

have prosecuted

publishers for printing obscene material. However, minor fines

or probation have been the general result and have

been

offset by an increase in the paper's circulation.

VENCEREROS BRIGADE

The Vencerenos Erigade (VB) was organized in

by assisting in the current sugar one harvest. It is head-

quartered in New York City and is composed of the National

Executive Connitice, regioual rocruiters and the brigade members

who travel to Cuba.

The Executive Conmittee is composed of

individuals representing a variety of New Left groups, which

groups have also provided arganizational support. To date a

total of 782 individuals have been identified as

having

traveled to Cuba under VB auspices.

With regard to finances, the VB Ixecutive Committee

instructed the regionni secruiters that each region would be

responsible for raising travel funds for transportation of

participants to

, at which points

the Cuban Government would assume financial responsibility.

All excess funds were to be sent to the national office.

Money to support travel expenses was obtained through

various fund raising sifairs sponsored by the organizations

lending support to the VB.

These projects included bazaars,

filn showings,

and coffees.

In addition, information has been

developed disclosing that each traveler provided his own funds

for transportation and incidental expenses, and in some instances

they were arbitrarily assossed a proportionate amount to cover

the travel espenses for those mithout funds.
