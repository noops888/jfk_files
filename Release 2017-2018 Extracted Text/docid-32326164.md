MISCELLANEOUS - INFORMATION CONCERNING

(ACCOUNTING & FRAUD SECTION)

00: Los Angeles

Re Los Angeles airtel to Bureau 1/2/62.

Enclosed are four copies of a letterhead memo

concerning information furnished by LA 4350-c on 1/10/62.

Due to other matters that had to be discussed with informant

and frequency of out-of-town trips made by informant since

9/29/61, it has been administratively impossible to

discuss

this case in detail with informant at an earlier

date.

In view of information furnished by the informant,

it does not appear that at this time STEIN is associated

to at close degree with the Las Vegas operators.

Angeles will immediately conduct an investigation in an

attempt to develop a substantive violation of the anti-

racketeering statute relating to STEIN's reported activities

with respect to the La Scala Restaurant.

Upon completion of that phase of investigation,

Los Angeles will determine if complete investigation

STEIN's activities regarding HOFFA are warranted or if a

direct approach to STEIN would

appear

to be more

productive. J-LUM-AAG-Criminal Division
