Re Bureau letter to Philadelphia dated 11/25/68.

on 12/13/68 PH 872-C-TE furnished the following

information:

On 12/13/68 informant advised it is his opinion

that RUSSELL A. BUFALINO of Kingston, ra.s

is the "Boss"

of his own "Family" in the Upstate Pennsylvania

formerly of Pittston, Pa., was a very cruel and vicious

leader of the Mafia and he died sometime during the late

1940 's or early 1950's.

JOHN SCIANDRE allegedly received

his power in the Mafia from deceased LCN leader SANTO VOLPE

of West Pittston, Pa.

The informant further remarked that when he was

traveling with ICN member JOSEPH PAGANO, who 1s currently

a subject of the New York office, came in contact with

individuals who always asked about BUFALINO whenever they

learned that he, the informant, was from Pittston, Pa.

said he always received the impression from talking to the

people from New York City that BUFALINO was a very

important man.
