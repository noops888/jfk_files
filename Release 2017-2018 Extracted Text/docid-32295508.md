Philadelphia, Pa.

operates Cabana Steaks, 2152 South Dorrance Street, Philadelphia,

Pa., and YOYO's

Bar, 15th and Dickinson Streets, Philadelphia.

According to this informant, a "queer" by the name of NORMAN

works for "YOYO" at Cabana Steaks, 2152 South Dorrance Street,

Philadelphia.

On 10/4/63 PAUL RUST, Radio Station WIP, Philadelphia,

advised that WIP has not had any additional contacts from

anonymous letter writer or anonymous telephone caller.

is of the opinion that the anonymous telephone call he received

on 9/28/63 was a "prank" and not made by same person who wrote

the anonymous letter.

It appears that the presence of the vehicle bearing

Pennsylvania license

704-65P at Independence Square at 5:30

a.M.,

10/1/63, had no bearing on instant matter.

This area is known

to have

some "queer"

activity, which

would account for this

vehicle being in the area.

RUST of WIP will advise this office if any additional

contacts are made at WIP.

The Bureau will be advised of any

additional developments if and when they occur.
