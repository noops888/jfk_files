SUBJECT:

REQUEST TO SECURE TELEPHONE COMPANY

RECORDS ON JACK WASSERMAN

Assistant Attorney General Miller, of Criminal Division,

telephoned and advised that the Attorney General desired we obtain

telephone company records with reference to Jack, Wasserman, a

Washington, D. C., attorney. Wasserman is counsel for Carlos Marcello,

the notorious hoodlum, who was deported to Guatemala by the Immigration

and Naturalization Service earlier this month.

It was pointed out to Miller that while we desired to comply

with the Attorney General's desires in this connection the deportation

case had been handled by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

Miller was also informed, according to newspaper dispatches Wasserman

had threatened to bring suit against the Attorney General in connection

with the Marcello deportation. The reason for securing these telephone

company records is unknown to the FBI but tit it might be the Department

would want to consider this possible law suit in connection with any

reugests they might make of the FBI. It was also pointed out to Miller

there could be no guarantee that any requests that might be made of the

telephone company might not become known to Wasserman. Miller said

he appreciated having these matters brought to his attention and under the

circumstances no action should be taken by the FBI as he wanted to discuss

this further with the Attorney General in light of the ramifications that

existed. Accordingly, we are taking no further action pending further

advice from the Department.
