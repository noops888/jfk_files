(Commissioner J.P.R. R. Murray ](5)

your agency's review of the enclosed assassination records and consideration of whether the

information can be released

If your agency has no objection to the release of its information in the enclosed records, please

notify the FBI so that we may take steps to release the records to the Archives your agency

determines that the information cannot be released, please provide an explanation that the FBI may

present the evidence to the Board for their approval. The Act requires the FBI to present "clear and

convincing evidence" of a harm that would outweigh the need for public disclosure to the Board for any

information that we request to protect from disclosure. Such evidence to protect information is explained

in the Act as, "the public disclosure of the assassination record would compromise the existence of an

understanding of confidentiality currently requiring protection between a Government agent and a

cooperating individual or a foreign government, and public disclosure would be so harmful that it

outweighs the public interest." Upon receipt of your instructions and explanation for the protection from

disclosure, the FBI will provide the information to the Board and request that they sustain the request for

withholding the information from disclosure.

Please be aware that the Act requires that all information in the assassination collection at

Archives (even in the closed section) be released to the public in the year 2017, including information

that the Board agrees to protect. The Act has provisions to extend postponements (protection of

information from disclosure) past 2017 with the certification of the President of the United States that the

information continues to meet the requirements for postponement. The FBI will periodically review the

postponed material for the need of this certification.

As you know, the FBI normally protects information from your agency pursuant to applicable

Executive Orders and the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts exemptions. However, the Act is a

unique Federal law that applies only to JFK assassination records. Please note, it is our opinion that

release of information in the JFK assassination records should not in the future affect the FBI's standard

policy of protecting your agency's information in other investigations or in other contexts.

The FBI is committed to the opening of all information related to the assassination to the United

States public, but appreciates that certain information is sensitive and not proper for release. Therefore,

the FBI requests your consideration and understanding of this matter and the continuance of your

outstanding association with our agency.

Thank you, in advance, for your cooperation. Please direct any questions to our Legat Office

representative or to Carol L. Keeley, Acting Unit Chief of the Historical and Executive Review Unit of

the FBI, 935 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20535, (202) 324-0671.

Sincerely yours,

Louis J. Freeh

Director
