as well as other law enforcement agencies, not to

reveal the identity of Bureau informants to those

agencies, even though the information furnished by

"receives all information but does not share information"

with other law enforcement agencies, Federal,

state, and

local.

the committee at this point

was unequivocally

advised that this has not and is not the case of the FBI,

and that information obtained by the FBI which is of an

At one point during the questioning,

when

SA Sammon was being questioned as to squad assignment

classifications,

and identities of Agents of the Miami,

Florida,

FBI Office from 1961-1964, SA Sammon advised

the committee that as that period of time was from

14-11 years in the past, sA Sammon would try to be as

accurate as

possible as to months and years involved;

however, the committee was reminded SA Sammon's

recollection of the events may be six months to perhaps .

a year off. Mark Speiser advised SA Sammon that the

committee would only allow a four month leeway. This

statement that events occurring 14-17 years ago would be

there would be no

on SA Sammon, unless the committee intended to furnish

him documentary verification.

his interrogation, with the exception of SA Sammon

being furnished a

lengthy article from what appeared

article was furnished SA Sammon briefly in an effort

to identify Somerset by photograph as it appeared in

Somerset, due to the length of time involved, and the

fact that the photograph was not a good likeness, or

thoughts concerning KING and the black civil rights movement, in.

that his father, who was a pastor of the Central Baptist Church at

Grenada, Mississippl, died of a heart attack which he, WILsON,

thought was caused as a result of racial tensions at Grenada brought

on by the forceful integration of his father's church.

WILSON stated that approximately five or six months before

KING's murder, he started gathering information on the movements,

habits, and whereabouts of KING.

WILSON advised that he had a red and white Bonanza airplane,

Register Number 34L, and a Cessna 310 twin-engine aircraft, which was

blue and white, which planes he used to fly to different places

where KING, was supposed to be.

1975, he had it reworked at a

gunshop in Columbus, Mississippi, on

Fourth Street across from a bank..

rifle and a shotgun but had told him that he had sold it.

Mr. WILSON advised that there was a garbage strike in

progress at Memphis, Tennessee, and that MITCH called him at his

store in Grandview, Missouri, and told him that KING was coming to

to thoroughly interview GLADEN.

to meet with GLADDEN there. GLADDEN advised he is employed as

Manager of the Social Security Office in Gulfport, Miss. (tel#

896-3221), but lives in the Gulf Park Estates area of Ocean

Springs. His house is the lst house on the left on Meadowlark

Dr, which is the second street to the right after passing the

golf course in Gulf Park Estates.

Thewriter and SA ROYCE D. HIGNIGHT were enroute to GLADDEN'S

residence when instructions were received from Gulfport SRA BEN

GRAVIS to discontinue.

Telephonic inquiry of SRA GRAVES determined FBI HQS had

instructed that no action be taken regarding the foregoing.

was aware of information in WILSON'S possession and that no

interview of GLADDEN tould be conducted.

he (WILSON) had killed DR. KING rather than JAMES EARL RAY.

No further details were asked of GLADDEN by thew riter and

he was advised he would

be recontacted in the event further

information was required.

GLADDEN advised he will probably terminate WILSON'S employment

as a result of this matter.

Per instructions of ASAC MURRAY, no further action being

taken.

On August 17, 1978, at around 11:45 p.I.

WILSON telephoned ALICE GLADDEN at the GLADDEN residence

in Ocean Springs.

He asked to speak to WILLIAM D. GLADDEN

who at that time was asleep. GLÄDDEN answered the immediately

WILSON arrived at the gift shop at the appointed

time driving his old model blue Chevrolet with a white top

and unrecalled Louisiana license tags. He had been drinking

because his breath smelled of alcohol and his eyes were

extremely red; however, he did not talk like an intoxicated

person. He appeared very depressed according to GLADDEN.

When questioned by GLADDEN as to what

he meant by this remark WILSON said,

"I am the man that

murdered Martin Luther King•

" GLADDEN advised that WILSON

then talked with him for the next hour and 15 minutes about

how he had grown up in Grenada, Mississippi, where his father

was a Baptist preacher.

WILSON described how his father's

church was open for local blacks to worship in and they were

treated like neighbors.

When the racial unrest was running

rampant in the State of Mississippi in 1967 some "northern

blacks came to the church escorted by FBI Agents. WILSON's

father welcomed them to the church only if they were not there

"for trouble"

However, according to WIlson, they did come

for trouble and his father subsequently died of a heart attack

as a result of the racial unrest.

WILSON then stated

again that, "I am the one that

pulled the trigger."

He stated that the KING killing was

a conspiracy and that he was the logical one to pull the

trigger. WILSON told the GLADDENs that he had been with the

Government (not further described) and had been involved in

undeclared wars (not further described).

WILSON also said that

he knew MARTIN LUTHER KING's father anc

right next door to KING's cousin and knew the entire family.

(WILSON did not furnish the name of KING's cousin to the

GLADDENS.)

WILSON told GLADDEN that JAMES EARL RAY was the

"fall guy"

• He said that RAY only saw him twice but WILSON

knew who RAY was.

RAY was supposed to have gotten away clean.

WILSON said that he was surprised that RAY has brought it

all back up again inasmuch as he (RAY) is probably due for

parole in about two years.

WILSON told GLÄDDEN's son that he

could tell he did not approve of what he had done but that

he had better keep his nose out of it.

WILSON, who apparently had served in the U. S.

Air Force, indicated that he had worked in some type of

investigative work while in the military service.

WILSON kept bringing up the fact that he was

going to meet with the Sheriff of Memphis, Tennessee

norning of August 18, 1978, and even offered to furnist

GLADDEN this individual's name and telephone number if he

wanted it for verification. GLADDEN declined.

WILSON said that he had gone through 10 years of

hell because he killed KING. He said that it had ruined

26 years of a good marriage and now his conscience was bothering

him more than ever in the last few years.

WILSON referred to a sketch of the KING murder

suspect which apparently had been recently shown on television

and told GLADDEN that the sketch was almost an exact likeness

of him (WILSON).

WILSON said that he has a sister in Fulton,

Mississippi, who telephoned him in Ocean Springs after the

sketch was shown on television saying that the sketch looked

About three hours after this conversation WILSON walked into

GLADDEN's gift shop.

He was clean and neat and told GLADDEN

that he apparently

had been in touch with the FBI and that

the FBI was not going to do anything to him.

According

to GLADDEN, WILSON indicated that he had worked out some

"bargain" with the FBI and now WILSON wanted to live a normal

routine life. He asked GLADDEN if he could continue working

in the watch

According to CHILDRESS, she believes that WILSON was in the

United States Army during 1968, and WILSON has stated that

he was a Prisoner Of War (POW)

during the Vietnam conflict.

She is aware that WILSON visited the Veterans Administration

(VA) Hospital in San Antonio, Texas on several occasions, but

she possesses no knowledge of him suffering from any psychiatric

problems. By previous marriage, WILSON has three children, two

Dear Don,

On October. 12, 1978, I recieved a letter from James Earl Ray requesting that

this Department try to locate a motel that he stayed in or April 1, 1968. The

motel is supposed to be on Highway 72 in Corinth. I checked with the Southern

Motel and they have no record. I also checked with the Corona Plaza. They have

no record but the ownership has changed hands several times since 1968 and the

present owner is trying to locate the old records.

Enclosed you will find a copy of the letter and diagram of the location of

the motel. Also enclosed is a message from the National Sheriff's Association

addressed to Mr. Ray.

Do you think there is any reason why we should check any further into this matter

since you checked all the motels in 1968?

If we can be of any assistance to you in the future, please feel free to call

on us.

With kindness and best regards,
