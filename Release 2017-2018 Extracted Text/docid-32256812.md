Select Committee on Assassinations

U.S. House of Representatives

3331 HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING, ANNEX 2

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20515

June 26, 1978

009506

The Honorable Harold Brown

Secretary of Defense

Washington, D. C. 20201

Dear Mr. Secretary:

On December 16, 1977, I wrote to Vice Admiral Inman of

the National Security Agency, requesting that certain members

of the Committee staff be allowed access to data, if any, re-

lating to the assassination of President Kennedy, but particu-

larly relating to the Cuban Intelligence network of Premier

Castro, with emphasis on operations by Cuban Intelligence

operatives.

A copy of that letter is enclosed for your informa-

tion.

Subsequent to this request, Professor G. Robert Blakey,

Chief Counsel to the Select Committee, had a number of conver-

sations with your Special Assistant John Kester, in an effort

to set up a briefing by appropriate staff people from NSA... We

had hoped that this briefing could have taken place prior to

the end of March when Committee members and staff personnel

were to be out of the country on matters relating to this re-

quest.

Nevertheless, a briefing was not arranged until May 15,

1978 at 1:00 p.m., over a month ago.

The briefing was held,

as scheduled, but the content of it had nothing whatsoever to

do with our initial request.

We have been waiting since that

time for another briefing to be set up.

What we have received

is one short, hardly adequate, letter saying essentially that

no information is possessed relative to the President's

assassination.

It is the Committee's feeling that to pursue this matter

in the future as we have in the past would be a futile effort

on our part.

Consequently, I respectfully request that you look into

this matter personally, and advise me of the status of our

request and the reason why we have not received any compliance.
