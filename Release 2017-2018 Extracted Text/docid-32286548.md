INFORMANTS (continued):

from out of town had stopped by the motel looking for

JUNIOR, not realizing that he no longer operated same.

They-

told BARNES that they did not want to meet JUNIOR in public,

and wanted to know where he was "sleeping." PC did not know

the significance of this information.

On 1/17/70 former SA WILLIAM F. DUKES, Gulfport,

Miss., attorney, furnished the following information to

SA DAVID P. HURLEY:

On the day that DONALD LESTER JAMES was buried,

he was telephonically contacted by former JN 14-C. During

the conversation, this former source advised that prior to

the date that JAMES was shot, she was visited by a former

acquaintance, INU KRAMER Or CRAEMER. KRAMER informed the

source that JAMES and two other men had pulled a "score"

on MIKE MAROON (phonetic), a Gulfport attorney and

close personal friend of CARLOS-MARCELLO., It appears that

the two men were in the room with MAROON and JAMES was in

an adjoining room.

After MAROON found that he had been taken,

he was able to identify one of the men involved in the

"score," and after this man received a severe beating,

he allegedly identified JAMES as being the third man.

DUKES advised that it is the former source's

opinion that possibly this was the motive for the

shooting of JAMES.

It is to be noted that the MIKE MAROON mentioned

above is probably identical with the MIKE MAROON who is an

attorney for CARLOS MARCELLO and who lives and works in

Shreveport, Louisiana. No additional information has been

obtained from other sources regarding the above mentioned

incident.

JN 424-C advised SA BENJAMIN F. CRAVES on

1/15/70, he had no suspects as to who might have shot

Caesar's Palace, which is located on U.S. Highway 90 in

Biloxi, Mississippi. Informant stated

that JAMES appeared

to have

been walking or running, and he appeared frightened,

and he made the commerit, "i'm going to have to make up my

mind to kill those two S.O.B.'s, or they are going to kill

me."

as "Frits" and "Big John Tech" (phonetic), who is an

associate of MORRIS. He stated that the story is on

the street that. JAMES supposedly told MORRIS and TECH

about DIANE WHITEMIRE, an associate of DUEY D'ANGELO,^

who is employed at the Sinbad Club in Biloxi, Miss.,

who had some jewelry at her Southern Ave. residence in

Biloxi. MORRIS and TECH supposedly would burglarize

WHITEMIRE's residence and then JAMES would fence the

items taken.

Supposedly something happened in connection

with this deal'

and the shooting resulted.

On the night of 1/6/70 or the morning of 1/7/70,

DIANE WHITEMIRE's residence was burglarized and she lost

between $8,000 and $9,000 worth of various items.

that he had heard about an associate of GERALD GUTHRIE

being killed at Biloxi, Miss. RONNIE JENKINS, Cairo, Ga.,

is employed as a truck driver and hauls produce out of

South Florida. JENKINS told informant that he was recently

at the service station operated by HOLLIS LAFAYETTE GUTHRIE,

U.S. Hwy. 84 East, Thomasville, Ca. HOLLIS LAFAYETTE GUTHRIE,

aka

"SHORTY," received a telephone call from JIMMY ALBRITTON,

Jackson County, Fla. ALBRITTON told GUTHRIE about someone

getting shot..

GERALD GUTHRIE was present when his father

received the above telephone call. GERALD GUTHRIE immediately

wanted to leave to go to the place where this person had been

shot. His father, HOLLIS LAFAYETTE GUTHRIE, told him that

he could not go.

AT 2025-C had also heard through RONNIE JENKINS

hat someone had taken an automobile belonging t

BRALD GUTHRIE at Fort Walton Beach, Fla.

poker game operated by THILBERT ROGERS in the vicinity of

Pavo, Ga. "GUTHRIE and PAYNE allegedly had a large number of

$50 bills. Between them, they lost approximately $600 at ..

this poker game. THILBERT ROGERS operates a grocery store

on the Ione Road approximately two miles out of Pavo, Ga.

He occasionally holds poker games in a wooded area in the

vicinity of Pavo.

Prior investigation by the Atlanta. Office has

shown GERALD GUTHRIE to be the son of HOLLIS LAFAYETTE GUTHRIE,

aka "SHORTY" GUTHRIE.

Prior to the fall of 1963,

HOLLIS LAFAYETTE GUTHRIE operated a numbers racket in the

vicinity of Thomasville, Ga.

This numbers racket was

broken up and HOLLIS LAFAYETTE GUTHRIE was subsequently

sent to prison. He now operates a service station on

U.S. Hwy. 84 East, Thomasville, Ga. Prior investigation

has shown his son GERALD GUTHRIE to be a gambler.

GERALD GUTHRIE is primarily a poker player. He has been

an associate of JIMMY ALBRITTON, Jackson County, Fla..

AT 2025-C has previously advised that

GERALD GUTHRIE is a crooked poker player and is not too

clever in concealing his manipulation of the cards. Informant

feels that GERALD GUTHRIE will someday get into serious

trouble because of his crooked card playing.

On 3/17/70 NO 1283-PC advised SA HAROLD V. HUGHES

that he had learned that as of yesterday ELDON LEGAN is

currently living in a trailer somewhere in the West Bank

area of

suburban New Orleans. Although he did not know the

name of the specific trailer park, it was his opinion that

a surveillance of PROVENZANO could readily determine this

information.
