Background on Mexico Station Support Assets

(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies)

1. (Unilaterall coverage. From the time the Mexico Station was opened in

(Aprtl 1947 (by Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1955, Charles

Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to Fa

exploit leads from the Seviet Finbassy. This unbrella type project (LIFEAT)

consisted of multi line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance

team and a mail intercept operation.

Phone taps

were placed by an employee of

who was handled by David WILSTED (pseudo).

The number of lines

tapped was limted

by availability of a listening post nearby

(since the taps were not made in the main central) and English/

Spanish (Soviet, Polish, Czech, etc) transcribers. Generally

these agents (mostly Mexican or Mexican American) were related

(which the station at that time felt was good security in that

if they talked about shop, they would talk to each other.)

Three photo sites were handled by Anderson with the kelp

of Harry Mahoney (retired, living in Chicago) and IDY TSD

people checking the best type of camera, film, and concealment

devices. These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LIMITED, LILYRIC,

and LICALIA). LIMITED was a fixed site bang opposite across

the street from the front gate of the Soviet Embassy which had

both a vehicle and foot entrance. The Soviet gate was on the

NorthWest corner of their compound and LIMITED was diagonally

across a double barrelled street on the Southeast anner of

that block.: LIMITSD was the first base and it operated strictly on an

ex erimental basis in the early stages. I think the Mexi Station bought

one storey

this property (a/Spanish Colonial stone house) through LIMOUSINE (check to

be sure). Later this house began to fall apart. This base was closed when

the Station got word that the photo of "uniden man" was

being released to the

public by the Warren Commission. The photo operators were moved

to

another apt

nearby. The property was sold (under an operational agreement with LIMOUSINE

for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment blding. to be built

on this site)..

LILYRIC was planned as an alternate photo base to LIMITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the same side of the street

as LIMITED but in the middle of the block South. It had a slanted view of

the front gate of the Soviet Enbassy. The agents in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both

Mexican families) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.

LILYRIC was a rented apartment. LICALIA, the third photo site, was located

in one of a row of four houses on the South side of the Soviet Embassy compound

which the Mexico Station purchased in about 1958 (check date), also using

LIMOUSINE as the purchaser (check). This site overlooked the back garden of

the Soviet Embassy compound. The purpose of this operation was

dozen or so agents who used three to for late model cars and a

when one of the surveillance agents got too close to his target and

was arrested by the. Mexican transit

think the staff first developed from a pro-Castro group celebrating on New

Years eve 1959. As I recall, it was a makeshift arrangement of volunteers

through most of 1960 and 61 with Tom Hazlitt producing voluminous reports on

their activities and recruiting agents right and left anong Cuban nationals in

Mexico City.

4. Personnel assignments. Of interest to us now is who was in Mexico during

the period prior to Oswald's visit and the subsequent investigation by the

Warren Commission. To deternine who was there and what they were doing I

have grouped persons together chronologically with areas of their

assignment

With this forewarning, LIFEAT (unilateral coverage) was disconnected. However

as I recall,

connected 5 Cuban lines, 5 Soviet lines, 3 Czech,

2 Polish, and 1 Yugoslav line. The basehouse listening post had a live

monitor who made short summaries of interesting conversations for a daily

resume which was received each day around 8 a.m. (passed by(flick) to Goodpasture

to get to Scott before 9.a.m.): Later (when the reel was completely recorded)

full transcripts were typed and passed to the station in the same way, however,

there was usually a time lag of a day or so.: Those transcripts which had

Russian or another language besides Spanish of English went out of the listening

post the day. after the transcript (of other conversations on the reel)was

typed. These reels were taken to another location where they were translated

and typed.: In the case of the Russian translations, Boris Tarasoff usually ran

about a week behind the date of

the conversation because of the volume of

Russian conversations among the embers of the Soviet Embassy. During this

period (fall of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the station

and carried to. Boris by one of the people from the Soviet Section or they may
