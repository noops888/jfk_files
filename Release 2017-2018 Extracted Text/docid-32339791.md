(originally referred to by the Cubans

OSCar TuS ACEVEDO. The FBI points

out speltane nould be Oscars mate

ACEREDO...

. Cuban añd FBI DOB's match.

Therefore it is felt that all are

talking about the same person.

This

individual has been identifiedi

(Originally referred to by the Cubans

• as Carlos DE VARONA.

The FBI had no

Iecord of a DE VARONA)

(The Cubans referred to a Israel

DEL PINO originally.

The FBI believed

DEL PINO to be the same person as

IsIael PINO-RAMOS, DOB:

29 Aug 36.

Obviously they are

not the same person)

(The thiee PINO's mentioned are not the

same person and it is impossible. to

match the correct one to the

photograph

without further particulars)

(Cannot establish which Israel PINO

matches the photograph.

Therefore he

cannot identify subject accurately)

(It has now been established that the

orlando BOSCH previously referred to by

the Cubans and identified as Orlando

BOSCH AVILA are not one and the same

persons.

We

also cannot establish

whether or not Orlando BOSCH

and Orlando

BOSCH MELUSA are one and the same person)

(The FABIAN previously mentioned by the

Cubans arid the Luis M. FABIAN PENDAS

mentioned here are probably the same

person and the name, DOB and photograph

represent one and the same person)

(RUIZ has been identified)

(Not previously referred to by the Cubans)

(BENITEZ has been identified)

(Cannot identify OROSCO RODRIGUEZ

definitly.

He could also be identical to

the original name referred to by the

Cuban

and could match the photo.
