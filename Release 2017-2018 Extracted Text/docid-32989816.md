COST OF RESPONDING TO INQUIRIES FROM

OTHER AGENCIES, CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES

AND REQUESTS UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION

AND PRIVACY ACTS (FOIPA)

By communication dated 1/14/76, the Bureau advised

as follows:

As you are aware, the FBI is currently responding to

inquiries from various Congressional committees and agencies such

as the General Accounting Office.

In addition, we are having to

devote ever larger amounts of resources to the

handling of requests

under provisions of the FOIPA.

While much of the effort required to process these

matters is expended at FBIHQ, the field offices are increasingly

being called on to give responses.

From time to time in the past,

the cost of responding to the inquiry of a particular committee or

agency has been monitored when this was deemed appropriate.

Since it appears the high volume of inquiries will

continue for the foreseeable future, it is necessary to provide

for an efficient, standardized mechanism of collecting cost data

and reporting the

time spent servicing requests from all oversight

groups which will be instituted immediately. The time spent on

FOIPA matters will also be reported through this centralized

system.

As major inquiries from new groups are received, the

time spent servicing these requests should also be reported.

Under this system, each field office will submit

an appropriate communication monthly reporting the time spent

responding to the requests of various groups and handling

FOIPA matters. This information must be received by the

fifteenth of the month following the month being reported on

and should be directed to the attention of the Budget and

Accounting Section.

Field offices are not expected to keep detailed

time records. Reliable estimates are acceptable and time

should be reported to the nearest whole hour.

at the present time are as follows:

IS 66-2579

For accountability purposes a report should be

submitted by each field office each month, even if there is little

or no time to be reported. The first report is to be submitted

by February 15, 1976, for

the month of January.

This data will be maintained in a cantrol file

(66-2579, and each Agent will be responsible to submit a copy

f any outgoing communication setting forth results of any surve:

requested by any of the aforementioned agencies with an addendur

setting forth the amount of Agent hours expended as well as

clerical hours.

In the event the outgoing communication is lengthy,

it would be more appropriate that a memorandum be submitted

to the control file with a copy to the pertinent substantive

file.

This cost data must reach louisville no later than the

13th of each month in order that the report to FBIHQ can be

prepared on a monthly basis.

Each Supervisor and SRA will thoroughly discuss this

matter with the Agents assigned in their respective areas to

insure that the necessary cost data is obtained.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER SECTION CHIEF

FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

BACKGROUND

I was first contacted by Mike Epstein, SSC Staff

Member, in April, 1975.

Tentative arrangements were made for

Epstein to come to Louisville, Kentucky, to conduct the

interview. I contacted the Bureau and was advised that a

current Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

(FBI) would be made available to sit in on the interview if

I requested it. Such a request was made and the Bureau so

advised Epstein. Subsequently, Epstein called me and asked

Whether I had requested someone from the Bureau to sit in

on the interview.

I replied that I had, and Epstein hung up

the phone.

No further contact was made with me until late

in September, 1975. At that time, Martha Talley, SSC Staff

Member, called me requesting that

I testify in Washington,

D. C.

After I

discussed this matter with the Bureau, I made

arrangements with Martha Talley to appear before Staff Members

of the Committee in Washington, D. C., on October 8, 1975.

The next day, after these arrangements were completed,

Martha Talley called and advised me that I would be testifying

under oath and that I could request to be represented by an

attorney.

No such request was made.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER SECTION CHIEF

FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

At approximately 10:00 a.m., October 8, 1975, I

was interviewed by the following named SSC Staff

• Members:

Mike Epstein, Mark Gitenstein, Mary De Oreo, Martha Talley,

and one other Staff Member whose name I cannot recall. Epstein

began the interview by handing me a typed sheet captioned

"Advice of Rights"

He asked me to read and sign that sheet.

Alter reading it, I declined to sign it. Epstein stated he

didn't understand my reluctance to sign the "Advice of Rights"

form inasmuch as the FBI always did this when they conducted

interviews.

Epstein was corrected on this statement and was

told that the FBI did not require every interviewee to sign

an "Advice of Rights" statement unless the interview involved

a possible violation of the law on the part of the person

being interviewed.

Thousands of interviews are conducted by

the FBI where it would be completely out of place to advise

people that statements they might make could be used against

them in a court of law.

Epstein then indicated that unless

the "Advice of Rights"

form was signed, no interview would be

conducted. I replied that I had come to Washington at the

insistence of the Committee, I was present, was available and

willing to go through with the interview but I would not sign

the "Advice of Rights" form. One point in the form stated

that the interviewee had appeared voluntarily for interview.

I made the point the I had not come voluntarily but had come

At the beginning of the interview, Epstein handed

me two or three memoranda. During the course of the interview,

ne let me read several other memoranda.

In all, he made

available to me a total of 12 memorandums, the captions and

dates of which are set out as follows:

1) F. J. Baumgardner to W. C. Sullivan, dated

August 22, 1963, "March on Washington".

2) F. J. Baumgardner to V: C. Sullivan, dated

cannot set forth the questions and answers in the order in

which they were asked.

However, I will set out as many of

the questions,

together with my

answers, as I can recall.

Practically all of the questions were asked by Mike Epstein.

I am unable to quote the exact questions and my exact answers;

however, I will set out the gist of the questions and my

answers

as best I can recall them.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER SECTION CHIEF

FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

Q. Why did the FBI open a case on Martin Luther King and

the SCLC?

A.

To the best of my recollection, some Communists were ir

the headquarters of the SCLC.

In addition, a secret

Communist Party member was exerting influence on King.

Since King made policy decisions for the SCLC, the FBI

had the responsibility to determine whether this important

organization was being used by the Communist Party for

its own purposes.

Q. When and why did the Bureau change from a Communist

infiltration investigation to an effort to expose King?

A. We had developed information concerning King's moral conduct

which indicated a vulnerability on his part and since the

Communists were exerting influence on him, it appeared to

be in the best interest of the country from a security

standpoint.

Q. Did

you know a tape of activity concerning King and others,

which took place at the Washington Hotel, was sent to

Mrs. King?

A.

I don't recall any such incident

and the first I can recall

about it was a news item which appeared a few weeks ago

in a Louisville newspaper.

That item indicated that a

•Special Agent of the Atlanta Office of the FBI was quoted

as saying he had made available,such a tape to Mrs. King.

Epstein said that story was wrong; the tape was sent from

Washington, D. C., by someone else. I asked him if he knew

who had taken

tape and he said he did.

I asked him

for the name of the person but he refused

to give it to

me. In answer to a question, I told Epstein I was aware

of the existence of the tape.

The only discussion I could

recall concerning the use of

the tape to expose King's

immoral activity was one I had with W. C. Sullivan when he

raised the question of whether it could somehow be made

public through the news media. I objected to this approach

and the matter was dropped.

FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS .

Q.

Epstein asked me about a conference at the Seat of

Government with two Special Agents from the FBI Office

in Atlanta for the purpose of discussing ways to expose

A. I didn't recall any such conference.

However, Lpsteir

then showed me a memorandum which set out the details of

such a conference, together with a list of possible ways

in which King could be exposed.

Q.

Epstein then showed me an undated, uncaptioned page of

typing on plain bond

paper.

He asked me to read it.

It was a diatribe against King and was full of dirty words

and bad language. Epstein asked me if I was familiar with

it.

A. I told him I did not recall having seen it before. I

asked him where he got it. He said it came from Bureau

files. I asked him if he

knew who wrote it. He smilingly

indicated that he did but he refused to tell me the name

of the person.

Q. Epstein asked the procedure we used in opening a Communist

infiltration case.

A. I couln't recall the exact criteria used to open such cases

but told him it would be necessary for us to have information

that the Communist Party had infiltrated an organization

before we would open such a case.

Q.

Epstein asked why was the FBI interested in the March on

Washington.

A. I replied that the FBI had information that Stanley

a Communist, had consulted with King about the

meyin and had advised him further, that there was a great

deal of Communist Party activity throughout the country

in organizing and urging people to participate in the march..

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER SECTION CHIEF

FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

In addition, Communist Party leaders and members planned

and did participate in the march and actually came to

Washington, D. C.

Q. At that point, Mark Gitenstein asked why did the FBI feel

that 200 Communists could come to Washington, D. C., and

take over the Government.

A. I replied that no one in the FBI thought the Communist

Party would take over the United States Government during

the March on

Washington.

I told him I thought he knew

that no one in the FBI had any such idea and I wanted

to know why he had

asked me such a question. Mr. Epstein

knew that I was quite annoyed and he mumbled some half

apologetic answer.

Q. Epstein showed me a copy of a note from Director Hoover

on a memorandum, in which the Domestic Intelligence

Division was recommending the sending of instructions to

the field to make careful checks and open Communist

infiltration cases where warranted.

In effect, the

Director's note said since the Domestic Intelligence

Division had informed him there was no material Communist

Party activity in the March on Washington, he was not

going to expend time and money on such matters.

A. I told Epstein it appeared

that the Director was upset

about something

but that I had no independent recollection

of what it was.

Q. Epstein asked whether there was at that time a deep

division of opinion in the Bureau with the Domestic

Intelligence Division taking the position there was no

significant Communist activity in connection with the

March on Washington and the Director taking the position

A. I replied that there was no deep division of opinion in the

Bureau on this subject to my knowledge. I made the point

that the Domestic Intelligence Division had not been

ordered to change its mind by the Director and that in

instance, as always, we reported factually on information

developed.

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER SECTION CHIEF

FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

@. Epstein continued to refer to the Bureau's efforts to

expose King and indicated he thought we had gone rather

far when we had furnished information about King to the

Pope.

I replied I never thought we had furnished any information

to the Pope.

Epstein then showed me a memorandum which

instructed SAC Malone of the New York Office to contact

Cardinal Cushing or Cardinal Spellman and brief them on

King in order that they could in turn get the information

to the Pope. This action grew out of a trip King was

making to Europe and it was thought that he would see the

Pope at that time. I pointed out to Epstein that although

the memorandum in question had been sent up over my name,

I had in fact not seen the memorandum inasmuch as someone

had initialled it for me. He looked at the memorandum and

agreed and then asked who had initialled it.

I replied

it appeared to be either James Bland or Charles Brennan.

Q. Epstein asked how the FBI knew Levinson was a Communist.

A. The FBI had reliable information that Levinson was a

secret member of the Communist

Party and was advising

King on important matters involving the activities of the

SCLC.

Q. Epstein wanted to get into a detailed discussion concerning

Levinson and his connection with the Communist Party.

A.

I declined to be drawn into any such discussion on the basis

it might compromise Bureau sources.

Q. Epstein persisted in discussing the Levinson matter.

A. I asked him if he was going to show me a memorandum or a

case file on Levinson as he had on other matters he had

asked me about.

such a situation, there would be a case file but I had

no independent recollection of the Levinson case.

INTERVIEW RE THE SECURITY INDEX

At 1:30 p.m. on October 8, 1975, Staff Members

John T. Elliff, Mark Gitenstein, Martha Talley, a recording

secretary whose name I didn't

get, and I went

to the office

of Senator Robert Morgan (NC), where I was sworn by the

Senator.

The Senator appeared to be somewhat ill at ease

and commented to me that "Times change."

He explained that

if he or some other Senator was not present,

I would not be

required to testify under oath unless I wished to.

He then

explained that he had to get back to the Capitol and he left.

The Staff Members, the recorder and I then went to the interview

room.

Epstein asked me to read a lengthy memorandum which

compared the Department's criteria for Security Index subjects

with the FBI's criteria for Security Index subjects. During

the course of the questioning, Epstein made available to me

five or six memoranda which ranged in time from 1949 to 1956

or 1957. All of these memoranda had to do with Security Index

matters.

Martha Talley opened the session by reading into the

record the "Advice of Rights"

She did not ask me to sign the

"Advice of Rights".

When she had finished reading; I put into

the record an objection concerning

the statement that I was

voluntarily before the Committee. I wanted the record to

clearly show that I was appearing at the insistence of the

Elliff commented he couldn't see what difference

it made. I told him it made a difference to me.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER SECTION CHIEF

FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

A. I replied that I entered the service in 1939, was transferred

into the Seat of Government in 1942 or 1943, that I

supervised War Labor Disputes Act cases; that at or near

the end of World War II, I was transferred to the Internal

Security Section.

In 1946 or 1947, I was promoted to the

position of Number I Man in that section.

In 1948 or 1949.

I was made Chief of the Internal Security Section and remained

in that position until I retired in 1966. I called attention

to the fact that the dates were to the best of my recollection

but that my service record would speak for itself concerning

the accurate dates.

Q. Talley asked me to explain the origin of the Security Index.

A. I told her it was in operation when I first came to the

Seat of Government and I could not furnish any information

concerning the history of the Security Index.

Q. Elliff asked whether I approved the inclusion of names

in the Security Index.

A. I replied I thought I had done so. Gitenstein then remarked

something to the effect, "I think we had better show him

this memo." He was referring to a memorandum he was holding

in his hands.

He then showed me the memorandum which

revealed that individual supervisors initialled forms

for including subjects'

names in the Security Index.

The

case Agent's initials were countersigned by an experienced

Supervisor.

I then

I stated that apparently I had been wrong

when I recalled that I had approved the inclusion of

subjects'

names in the Security Index.

They then showed

me another memorandum to the effect that I should personally

approve certain Security Index subjects before their names

could beincluded in the Security Index. I pointed out that

this was what I must have had in mind when I thought I

had approved cases for the inclusion of the subject's name

in the Security Index.

FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

Q. With respect to the memorandum which compared Department

Bureau concerning the criteria.

A. I told Elliff I had no independent recollection of such

a dispute although there could have been one.

Q. Talley asked why the FBI had made a list of names of United

States citizens.

A. The purpose of the Security Index, to the best of my memory,

was so there would be available the names and addresses of

Communist Party members who were considered dangerous to

the internal security of the country in order that they

could be apprehended if such action became necessary during

a national emergency.

Q. How did the FBI decide what names to put in the Security

Index?

A. Members of the Communist Party were included in the Security

Index but I couldn't recall other breakdowns in the Index.

Q. How did you open Communist infiltration cases?

A. I couldn't recall the criteria but if the Communist Party

had infiltrated an organization and were influencing the

activities of the organization, we would open a Communist

infiltration

Q. Did the FBI use the Security Index to open cases? If a:

Security Index subject attend the meeting of an organization,

would a Communist infiltration case be opened?

A. As far as I know, the FBI did not set up the Security Index

in order to use it to open other cases. The mere attendance

of a Security Index subject at a meeting would not be

FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

sufficient to cause the FBI to open a Communist infiltration

As I recall it, there would have to be information

that the Communist Party had infiltrated the organization.

In addition, the aims and purposes of the organization

itself might reflect Communist influences.

Q. If one Security Index subject attended a meeting, would

a Communist infiltration case be opened?

A. It wasn't a question of one or six Security Index subjects

attending a meeting. The FBI utilized its experience in

applying the criteria we had for opening such cases.

From time to time, Gitenstein and Elliff would go off

the record for a discussion of matters of which I had no

independent recollection.

I tried to make it clear that the

main thrust of the Security Index was to have available the

names and addresses of people who would be dangerous to the

internal security of the country in order that they could be

detained in the event of a national emergency.

Q. Talley asked if the apprehension program would be initiated

on the basis of a memorandum prepared by a Special Agent

of the FBI.

A. I told her that the program of apprehension would not be

initiated in that way. I explained that the FBI would

receive orders from the Attorney General in this regard.

I told her that there was a prepared set of rules called

a Portfolio which outlined the steps to be taken in order

to put the program into operation.

Q. Elliff asked if consideration had ever been given to

putting the Security Index into operation.

A. I replied that on one occasion, Carl Hinnrich, Assistant

to A. H. Belmont, had asked me to come to his office to

discuss putting the program into operation.

Q. When did this occur?

A. I don't remember the year.

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER SECTION CHIEF

FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

Q.

Talley asked if any review was ever made of the Security

Index.

A.

Yes. The cases were under constant review and great care

was exercised to make certain that names were deleted from

the Security Index when such action was warranted.

Near the end of the questioning, Elliff showed me

a memorandum dated in 1955 which Mr. Tolson had sent to the

Director.

In this memorandum, Mr. Tolson commented that the

FBI had tried to get the Department to review all Security

Index cases without success.

He pointed out that we were

including names of people who would be apprehended in the event

the program was ever made operational. He was concerned about

this because in every other type of case, Departmental Attorneys

or United States Attorneys in the field

made the determination

concerning apprehension.

He felt it was a heavy burden for the

Bureau to carry this responsibility with respect to the Security

Index. Mr. Tolson recommended that the cases, or at least

INTERVIEWS OF FBI EMPLOYEES

BY CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES

Bureau advised on 10/9/75, as £01lows:

By memorandum to all employees dated 5/28/75,

prior to submitting to interviews by representatives of Con-

gressional committees. The necessity of securing this

approval is prompted by the empioyment agreement all em-

ployees have signed.

You were advised that Congressional staff members

were conducting interviews of former and/or current employees

and that this Bureau had pledged its cooperation with Congress.

Our cooperative efforts, of course, must be consistent with

Bureau procedures.

Recently, we have had attempts by Congressional

committee staff members to interview current employees without

prior contact with FBI headquarters. You are again reminded

that if a representative of a Congressional committee should

contact a Bureau employee, that employee should decline to

respond to questions posed to him and advise the Congressional

staff member of the necessity of receiving FBI headquarters

approval before responding to questions..

the Attorney General advised that legal representation for

matters.

However, should the Department subsequently conclude that

Czarnecki was not advised of any constitutional

Mr. Smith stated that while he was in his

Washington, D. C. office earlier this week, members of

the SSC staff, identities not mentioned,

nor had he read it. He stated it dealt with requesting

•of Federal Income

Tax returns of certain Key Activists

from the U. S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Czarnecki

advised he could not recall this specific memorandum nor

its contents.

Czarnecki advised Mr. Smith that he doubts

that he had "signed out" a memorandum and then explained

all of his correspondence was approved or "signed out" by

a Unit Chief to which Czarnecki was assigned at any

given time. It was further explained that Czarnecki had

• U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEY OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT IN

' CHARGE (SAC) STANLEY S. CZARNECKI

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Mr. Smith asked Czarnecki if he had ever requested

IRS to furnish the FBI any income tax returns on Key Activists

and what procedure was followed in requesting same.

Czarnecki

explained he could have, however, could not recall if he

personally had ever requested such tax returns; however, he

does recall such requests were made on a selective basis.

These requests were made only after careful review of the

request and approval obtained by officials within the

Domestic Intelligence Division.

Smith asked Czarnecki if he had ever seen any of

the tax returns and what type of security was afforded them.

Czarnecki advised he had seen some tax returns of Key

Activists and believes the number was small.

These returns

as well as all documents located in the Domestic Intelligence

'Division were afforded top security and most all such material

was reviewed on a need to know basis.

Smith also asked whether the Bureau supervisor handling

Key Activists

had direct live contact with Internal Revenue

Service Agents.

Czarnecki stated he recalls no direct contact

was ever had with IRs people by the regular Bureau supervisors.

Smith asked Czarnecki's opinion whether or not the

Federal Income Tax returns should be made available to all law

enforcement agencies to aid them in certain types of investi-

gations.

Czarnecki advised he could not speak for all of

law enforcement, however, depending upon the type of investigative

matter any and all information that could be developed on a key

subject or suspect would be helpful.

Mr. Smith advised Czarnecki that he may be back in

touch with him in approximately three weeks and, if necessary,

will have & copy of the memorandum which Czarnecki

allegedly

"signed out."

WASHINGTON

Atty: Gen. Edward

H. Levi said yesterday that the president

does not have legal authority to order

assassinations.

Appearing on ABC's "Issues and An-

swers,

"Levi was questioned

about

charges that the Central

Intelligence

Agency was involved in assassinations of

foreign leaders.

Levi said the president "does not have

a reserve, constitutional power

to go

around ordering assassinations."

, How-

ever, he said, a President might discuss

assassination

the same thing as ordering the violation,*

he said.

if the Rockefeller Commission report,

which Levi said he has not seen, contains

information about

possible crimes,

"we

will take it seriously" and determine if

prosecution is warranted, Levi said.

The eight-member: Rockefeller Commis-

sion,

appointed six months ago by Presi-

dent Ford to investigate charges that the

, CIA was involved in widespread domestic

spying; has

decided to delete

trom

its

final report information about assassina-

Levi said such material could not be

sought under the

Freedom of Informa-

tion Act "'if we're preparing a case on it."

Bureau official now retired, of

He had been previously contacted by Investigator

Committee. He told EPSTEIN that he preferred to be interviewed

here and EPSTEIN agreed to this arrangement. He later called

SAC. KITCHENS who talked with Supv. PAUL DAILEY at FBIHQ and

arrangements at that time were made to have an agent from

FBIHQ,with BAUMGARDNER during interview.

According to BAUMGARDNER at 6:00 PM on 4/28/75, he

received a call from Supv. DAILEY who advised him that no

agent would be available to assist him at this time as such policy

was being worked out and DAILEY suggested that BAUMGARDNER

wait to be interviewed until such policy was formulated.

BAUMGARDNER said that at approximately 6:30 - 6:45 PM,

1/28/75, he received another call from Investigator EPSTEIN who

asked him if he had requested the fBl to have someone present

during interview and he answered in the affirmative.

then told him goodbye and hung up. BAUMGARDNER now feels that

he will be subpoenaed to Washington to appear before the Committee.

BAUMGARDNER wants to talk 'to somebody at FBIHQ and

requested to speak with the Assistant Director of appropriate

division, who can help him with some guidance in his testifying

before, as he said "the situation gets out of hand".

BAUMGARDNER stated he was very proud of his role

in the FBI and he is willing to combat any criticism of the

EBl during that period, however, wants some guidance prior

to receiving a subpoena as he "does not want, to put the Bureau
