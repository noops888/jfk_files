VIA

: Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT

Tentative Plans of Senator Robert Kennedy

to Visit West Berlin on 1 May

REFERENCE

: EGBA-86312, dated 12: April 1968

1. This memorandum is for your information.

2. We have just been advised by

Senator Robert Kennedy may plan to speak at the

that

May rally

in West Berlin.

The Press Chief of the West Berlin Senate, Peter

told a CIA staff officer that Dr. Martin Luther King,

JI. had originally

been scheduled to appear at the 1 May

rally.

After King's assassination the Berlin Senate authorized

the Roy Bernard Public Relations Agency of New York to invite

Senator Kennedy as a replacement speaker. According to Herz,

Senator Kennedy informed the Bernard Agency that he wanted a

written invitation, which has been issued.

4. Herz also mentioned that the U.S. Mission to Berlin

had been informed of these plans but

has seen

no mention of the matter in Mission traffic.

5.

The

annual May. Day Tally in Berlin has become a

tradition.

It takes place

in

a large field in front

of the

restored Reichstag building,

which is immediately adjacent to

the sector border

between East and West Berlin near the

Brandenburg Gate.
