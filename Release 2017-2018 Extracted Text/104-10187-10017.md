the fomer LNITED property was sold to LISts, who as per forral acree

sent with the station, demoliched the off structuro and cona-ructed a now

edifice.

While 1t was Initlally cente-pleted to place the ILITED

An Increace in the hours of both the photographic ad physical curvolllance

hours durini the weekdaya and to have the LDITED base provide

photographic and plysical curveillance coverage froe 160<- 1030 hourg

on weekdays and fron 0900-1300 hours on weekends. Inese chances were

dictated by the followin considerations:

The new LIMOUSIN building offers a auch better vantage point

for both photographic and physical surveillance then does the

present complex which houses the LILITIC and LaJico bases,

Therefore, tho Station felt that the personnel occupjino thia

new base should be those posuessin the highest tecralcel skille

and aloo those able to provide the eost thorough and couplete

covereite

Since the LIMITED base now hes only one trcired

operator while the LITRIC basehouse has three, the LIHuC aroug

and a revision of working hours wes inuicated.

secause it was apparent that the covernie of the LIslICK

Installation would be a lon, ranse eud' continuinz requireant,

the station desired to ntal? the now bese with personal of lon

rarte potential.

LIMPIY-S, now alnost 60 yeers old, does not

possess this potential; horever, the LILVRIC agent complex
