has been residing at his Los Angeles apartment April 10,

ROSSELLI, may have accepted employment in a public relations

capacity with a bank in Las Vegas.

Source indicated that

ROSSELLI had assisted BREEN in obtaining this position.

The name "HOLLY" was mentioned and this may refer to HARLEY E.

and who in the past has been mentioned by LA 4396-C* as

a possible employer of BREEN.

LA 4268-C advised that ROSSELLI and MAURICE H.

were at the Friar's Club, Beverly Hills, California,

during the afternoons of

April 10 and 11, 1963.

checked out of the Beverly Crest Hotel on 4/11/63 and presumably

On the evening of 4/11/63 ROSSELLI picked up a

girl at the Grosvenor Apartments in Beverly Hills,

California

lowers, westwood Village, Los Angeles, California.
