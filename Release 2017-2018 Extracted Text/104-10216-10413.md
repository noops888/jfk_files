I contacted the

Batista supporters.

We carried out the killing of one of the

A lot of things the

anti-BATISTA students did were not effective but we did more

than talk and this old assassination is proof that people

like Rolando and myself act.

3.

After CASTRO took over I left Cuba and engaged in

anti-Castro activities.

I got shot in

the process,

I was

betrayed by some of the Cuban exiles when I was going to bomb

Cuba, I saw how the CIA bungled and I became bitter.

I was

bitter about Rolando too.

I thought that he had turned

communist.

I sent him a

message a long time ago, telling him

that he was a traitor and no friend of mine.

That was when a

Pan American stewardess whom he liked came

to me with a message

from him about how he was still a friend of mine

and things

were not like they seemed:

I got mad and told her to tell him

off for me and I showed her the bullet wound in my leg that I

had because I was fighting CASTRO and those with him like

Rolando.

Afterwards I did not hear from Rolando until just a

little while ago. flsriRin-s

It was in lay when I got a letter from an old friend,

(Lude FERNANDEZ"He had written to me before to let me know

that he is working for the CIA in Paris.

This letter in May

was pretty confusing but luis made it clear that there was.

something very important, that it involved Rolando CUBELAS;

that Rolando wanted me to go to Paris on an urgent matteabout

and that another friend, Luis TRASANCOS, knew something

it.

The letter said that the CIA knew about this and that

Luis FERNANDEZ thought maybe the CIA already had told me to

go to Paris, although he was not sure.

5.

I decided to go to Paris because of the mention of

Rolando.

The CIA had taken my old Cuban passport when I was

in training in Guatemala and never returned it.

Also, because

I got caught when I tried to bomb Cuba,

the INS had warned me

not to travel outside the U.S. saying I could go to jail for

five years and I could not get a re-entry permit and all that.

However, I checked with an INS officer who knew me.

He said

that probably the INS was not so interested in me anymore and

I probably could get re-entry.

Because the letter was so

pressing in my travelling at once,

I decided not to go through

• lot of red tape.

I went to Florida to see my brother,

Rene,

residing at 5000 SW 69th Avenue, Miami. He arranged through

some friends whom I don't know to get me a false Cuban passport.

(Note:

The pp has number 423335, is dated 19 November 1964,

bears the true

name of the source, and has entry and departure

cachets for London on 4, 7, 10 and 21 May

1965; for Le Bourget

on 7 and 21 May; and for Orly on 29 May

1965.)

I• bought a

ticket and left for Paris without having any

trouble.

I am

not sure about the dates and the sequence of travel because

everything was so hurried.

I went to London as well as to

Paris and I tried to go to Spain but had to turn back. Anyway

I remember the important things.

6. At Paris I telephoned Luis TRASANCOS who invited

When I got

there, I found Alberto

I called Luis aside to tell him

7. Rolando CUBELAS had been in Paris a couple of months

earlier and, according to El loco, had left a letter instructing

El Loco did not have

the letter with him but I believe it.

I know that Cubans are

liars and exaggerate and are insecure and all that is wrong

about them, but I know what is good about them and how to check

on things.

So I cross-questioned El Loco and others until I

was sure that they told me the truth.

What I an telling you

is what I found out from El loco, confirmed later through'El

Mago ROBRENO, and confirmed in part through questioning others

who know parts of the story but not all of it.

Rolando CUBELAS plans to kill Fidel and Raul CASTRO

and other key men in the regine.

Rolando has a house at

Veradero Beach adjacent to the house of Fidel, so it is easy

for Rolando to get Fidel any time.

The idea is not just to

kiIl Fidel but to change everything in Cuba. so Rolando has the

cooperation of other people whose names I do not know except

for El Loco BLANCO and El Mago ROBRENO and ALMEIDA.

Rolando is

very security conscious so he does not want people

to know any more than is necessary.

You must understand the

danger to these people.

What I can tell you now is that El Loco

has his faults and so

does ROBRENO but both worship Rolando and

are trustworthy insofar as he is concerned. El Loco is back

inside Cuba now.

El Mago Robreno is in Madrid and can get

messages in and out. He is responsible for killing many of

my friends and he kicked their dead bodies afterwards, so I

do not like him and maybe later I shall kill him;but for now I

believe that he is useful and can be trusted for the matters

which involve Rolando and the plot against Fidel CASTRO.

Some of the CIA people are not trustworthy. This is

what bothers Rolando CUBELA$ and El Loco and El Mago and me too.

This is why Rolando wants me to get his message through. He

wants an answer fast.

The message is that CUBELAS and the

others with him are

able to kill Fidel and others in the regime,

but they need some help and they need to know whether the CrA

and the U.S. Government are with them and willing to support

them or not.

If the answer is affirmative, Rolando will send

El Loco and El Mago said that on 5 or 6 June someone

that this person could carry the answer to Rolando.

I can fly to Madrid to give it in person and, if you want, one

move earlier than in two or three months.

26 July is a good date because all the chief targets will be

asserbled so it will be easier to get them all fast, but Rolando

did not send me this as his plan.

El Loco and El lago have access to ary Cuban Embassy

in Europe and these embassies are engaged in contacts with

communists and in subversion.

The same applies to embassies in

Yet your people play security games and

risky people.

El Loco was in Europe as an officer of Cuban Security.

them to one of your people in Madrid. What better proof. do you

want? What did you do about it?

Yet this man, a

member of the Cuban Security, offered to work as a double for

you and he tried to tell you about Rolando's plot.

Now he is

back in Cuba.

As the result of his frustration over your

attitude, he was in terrible mental state when I saw him. Had

This is why Fidel wanted ROBRENO out of Cuba.
