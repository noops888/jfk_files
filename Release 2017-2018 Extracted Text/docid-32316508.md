On November 20, 1964, NK T-2 advised that he

had been fired by his employer in November, 1964, for al-

logedly drinking on the job. NK T-2 denied the charge

and the matter is now in arbitration.

NK T-2 stated that he went to PROVENZANO in 2n

attempt to got his job back and PROVENZANO, in no uncertain

torms, told him he would not help him. Shortly thereafter

on November 19, 1964, the IntOrment receIved an anonymous

tolephone call offering to help him keep his case out of

arbitration and get him his job back for $50.00. The uaknown

individual attemptod to set up a moet towwhich the informant

was to come alone. NK T-? felt that this was an attempt to

get him alone and work him over becauso of his dispute with

al a and one hit

PROVENZANO.

Informant stated that PROVENZANO has lost con-

siderablo weight and complains that he is suffering from

sclerosis of the liver., according to the intormant.

the

rank and file faoling in Local 560 is that if PROVENZANO's.

appeal is denied by the Unital Statos Supreme Court and he

thereafter goes to jail he will be succeeded by SALVATORE

BRIGUGLIO, & Business Agent for Local 560, rather than by

his brother, SALVATORE PROVENZANO; aka, Sammy, who has, until

this time, been considered his logical successor.

On December 14, 1964, NK T-2 advised that: PROVENZANO

recently held a meting of his shop stewards and proposed

that the terms of the elected officers of the local be

increased from two to three years.: Informant stated that no

official notice of this has been given to the rank and file

of the local and as a matter of fact PROVENZANO has apparently

suspended the regular

membership meetings and they will,

hereafter, be held only when he desires to have them,

On December 8, 1964, NK T-3 advised that he con-

tinues to meet with PROVENZANO on cortain union affairs at

rogular intervals.

PROVENZANO is obviously concerned about

his case which is before the supreme Court and does not

appear to be a well man physically. It is the informant's

opinion that PROVENZANO will do nothing in his union of

personal activities which might endanger this appeal.

In tho opposition faction in Local 560, it 1s noted

they are bocoming nore powerful and more vocal and there is

apparently the goneral

leoling that they could boat: PRoVENZANO
