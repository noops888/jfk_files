It would appear from this that SELLI probably

resided at the apartment of BETSY DUNCAN while in town

during the week of 8/29 to 9/2/60.

on 9/13/60 through surveillance of LEDERER when

he left the apartment on North Crescent Heights Blva., 1t

It was later ascertained that this was a car belonging
