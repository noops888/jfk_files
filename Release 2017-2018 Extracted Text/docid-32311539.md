MR. BELMONT:

Miss Holm

With reference to my conversation with the Directo

last evening, concerning the ramifications arising out of

the Journal-American newspaper article, SAC Simon telephoned

from Los Angeles this afternoon and furnished the following

information:

BET

Los Angeles has recently develoned a new notential

"criminal informant by the name of

Sh oTHER

claims to be a sister-in-law of the seventry aeceasea motion

picture actor Dick Powell. Actually she is a high priced

prostitute.

in turn

has a contact by the name of Kathy Brown, who

has dealings with a man by the name of Irving Mink.

We have no information as to the identities of either Brown

or. Mink, and none has as yet been supplied by our new informant.

She alleges, however, that in connection with West Coast trips,

Irving Mink

is responsible for lining up two or three girls.

In connection with one trip the informant alleges she was

selected as one of the girls, but had to cancei out because

she was in the hospital. Three girls are presented on each

occasion and one is selected. No money is passed at the time,

but subsequently Mink pays the girl chosen $500.

The in-

formant named, as other girls haying been involved in the

past,

Angie Dickerson and Judy McCarthy.

Our informant is maintaining contact with Brown

and may be able to secure for us information which will

identify Brown and Mink.
