Dear Mr. Hatfield:

1.

Under a contract between this company and the United States

Government, five U.S. citizen employees of this company work full time

on a joint Australian-United States Government installation in Australia..

The installation is in a remote location approximately 1,000 miles from

the nearest city of any size, except for Alice Springs, which has a popu-

lation of approximately 9,000. Alice Springs is 15 miles from the instal-

lation and is the only town within commuting distance.

Because the installation operates on a 24-hour basis and these

employees must be available for duty at any time, it is necessary that

they live in quarters assigned to them by the U. S. Government.

Bachelors

are assigned rooms in BOQ's on the installation and married employees are

assigned specific houses in Alice Springs.

The need for immediate avail-

ability of all employees is such that all quarters, including those for

married employees, would be on the base except that security regulations

do not permit family members uf the company's employees to live on the

installation. It is a condition of employment that employees live in the

quarters assigned to them. They are given no choice in selection of

quarters, may not elect a cash allowance in lieu of quarters, and are not

allowed to lease, purchase or build houses or apartments on

their own.

The installation is a joint Australian-United States facility.

The bachelor quarters were constructed by the United States Government

and the houses by the Australian Government for occupancy by both American

and Australian employees.

Bachelor quarters on the base and the houses in

Alice Springs are rent free to the company's American employees, utilities

and furnishings included. In accordance with Australian Government policy,

the company's Australian employees are charged $A17.50 per week for the

houses including furnishings and utilities, which houses are comparable to

those supplied rent free to American

employees. Similar houses in

rent for about $A35.00 per week not including furnishings and utilities.

We are advised that the Australian Government subsidy to Australians of

about one-half of the rental value, like the U. S. Government's provision

of free housing, is paid in recognition of the housing shortage and the

requirement to live in assigned housing. It is our understanding that the

January 22, 1971

Australian Tax Department does not require Australian employees to report

as income the difference between the value of quarters and the rent paid,

although Australian income tax law provides that the value of lodging

supplied by an employer is taxable income.

We request your ruling as to whether the value of the bachelor

quarters on base or houses in town supplied to our American employees

under these circumstances must be considered income for tax purposes.

We understand that the Australian Government has advised that for purposes

of Australian taxation of American employees, it would treat the value of

the quarters in the same manner as the United States Internal Revenue

Service does.

If your tentative ruling is that the value of quarters is tax-

able income, we request a conference prior to the issuance of the final

ruling.

Australians of about one-half the rental value, like the U.S. Goverrmert's

Andrew J. Percival

Assistant General Counsel

Project SPACE Funding

At 4 p.m., 9 December 1976, the General Counsel informed the

undersigned that he was reviewing the legality of the funding for

project SPACE with the profits from TOMINERVA. Project SPACE

proprietary TOSHIELD is currently negotiating a contract with Collins

Radio involving $222,500.00. This sum is derived from the profits of

TOMINERVA. In view of the reconsideration of the legality of the funding

it was determined that the most prudent course of action would be to

delay implementation of the Collins contract until a final legal deter-

mination has been made. DC/Div D/SPB was immediately informed that

the contract with Collins Radio should not be concluded until a legal

decision has been reached on the funding. He was advised to take the

steps that he deems necessary to implement this decision. The General

Counsel states that his review will be concluded by approximately

15 December 1976.

Anthony E. Goldin

Assistant

General Counsel (DDO)

SUBJECT

Memorandum of 25 July 1977 Concerning

Collins Radio Company Activities in Morocco

1. This memorandum is in response to your question as

to whether the Subject documents can be disseminated to

the National Security Agency (NSA) .

2.

It is

understood that an acquaintance of yours,

employed by Collins Radio, gave the Subject documents to

you without your asking him for them and without your either

offering to pay or paying him for his voluntary act. It is

also understood that your acquaintance is witting of your

CIA employment.

The Subject documents are: (1) a Collins

proposal, already presented to the Government of Morocco

(GOM), for a high frequency communications system;

and, (2) an internal Collins memorandum proposing

a Collins

response to a GOM request for a foreign broadcast monitoring

system.

Collins did not specifically authorize its employee

to pass Subject documents to this Agency and is not aware

that they have been given to us.

CIA From

3. Section 5(b) (7) of Executive Order 11905 prohibits

CIA from the collection of information, however acquired,

concerning

the domestic activities of United States (U.S.)

persons.

"Collection" is defined at Section

• 5(a) (1) to

mean

any one or more of the gathering, analyzing,.

disseminating

ind storing of non-publicly available information without

the informed express

consent of the

subject of the information.

A U.S. person is defined

at Section

5(b) (9) to be a U.S.

citizen, a permanent resident alien or

a corporation or

organization incorporated or organized in the U.S.

4.

Based upon the above

facts,

I see no issue of

legality or propriety in your having received these documents

from the Collins employee. This is an example of what is

referred to as the "silver platter" doctrine - you did nothing

to solicit,

encourage or reward the Collins employee; you did

not intentionally or purposefully "gather" the documents.

5. CIA cannot, however, disseminate the documents, which

apparently constitute non-publicly available intormation,

unless authorized by Executive Order 11905.

Section 5(b) (b)(7)(1)

of the Order is an exception to the Section 5(b)(7) restriction,

and it authorizes us to "collect" information concerning

corporations which constitutes foreign intelligence or counter-

intelligence.

Foreign intelligence is defined at Section 5(a) (5)

to mean information concerning the capabilities, intentions

activities of any foreign power, or of any

non-u.s. person,

whether within or outside the u.s.,

or concerning

areas outside

he U.S. It is as much a substantive decision as it is a

legal determination whether these documents constitute foreign

intelligence.

6.

recommend that

a decision whether the documents

constitute foreign intelligence be made by Chief, Near East

Division (C/NE), or another,

appropriate senior officer in NE

Division.

I think C/NE could properly determine that they

constitute foreign intelligence based upon my understanding

that they describe the communications system a foreign power

is acquiring or seeks to acquire.

I am not, however, "au

courant" in the fine points of such matters. . If C/NE determines

the documents constitute- foreign

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SC 03537-77

Copy 1 of 2

8 April 1977

FROM:

Andrew J. Percival

Assistant General Counsel

SUBJECT:

TOTIGER - Collins Arrangement and a New Era in

Cipher Equipment Control

1. The prospective arrangement between the Collins Division of

Rockwell International and TOTIGER, a European manufacturer of cipher

machines, is nearer conclusion. TOTIGER has in the past and is presently

producing cipher machines that NSA finds defiant of analysis. D/DS&T/OSO

has tentatively devised a method of dealing with the problem that is

satisfactory to TOTIGER, NSA, Collins and OSO.

2. OSO has introduced TOTIGER management to representatives of

Collins and its parent Rockwell with a view of fostering a commercial arrange-

ment. It is hoped that TOTIGER will purchase from Collins micro-processor

designs for its new lines of equipment and eventually for all its equipment.

A micro-processor is a solid state mini-computer which is the heart of many

modern cipher devices. Collins would also manufacture and sell the micro-

processors to ICTIGER. The fact that the micro-processors are manufactured

in the United States guarantees that the level of cryptology is acceptable to

NSA. Any such devices exported from the United States must have a license

from the Office of Munitions Control. That license is contingent upon NSA

approval of the cryptology. This fact is known by those in the cipher machine

trade and would seem self-defeating. NSA states, however, that the level of

cryptology that is acceptable to them for export is of such a high level (as

high as 10?0) that expert mathematicians who are not aware of NSA's capabilities

are at loss to understand how useful and timely analysis may be accomplished.

It is true that this applies only to determinate systems. The most secure of

systems, random generated key, is not susceptible to analysis except in cases

of error in usage. Random key is not conducive in practice to volume traffic

and is a logistics problem. Most users have opted for determinate systems of

sophisticated cryptologic algorithm.

3. Collins, one of the worlds largest producers of telecommunications systems,

has no cipher equipment of its own manufacture. Collins is interested in offering

complete equipment packages to its customers including cipher devices. An

arrangement may be reached between Collins and TOTIGER to include the

latter's equipment in Collins systems packages. This will work to the benefit

of United States SIGINT collection efforts.

4. Should TOTIGER find the price of Collins micro-processors to be

too high based on the small volume of units required, several methods of

fostering the relationship have been proposed. One method would be a

classified contract between NSA and Collins for additional identical micro-

processor units to be delivered to NSA thus effectively raising the volume

and reducing the unit cost to TOTIGER. This contract would be entirely

separate and without reference to TOTIGER. NSA would be purchasing the

units for its own undisclosed classified purposes as it does with other contracters.

Another method would be a direct subsidy to TOTIGER through a CIA funding

mechanism. Other methods may suggest themselves as discussions progress

and the arrangements made between Collins and TOTIGER. come into sharper

focus.

5.. The governments of West Germany and Great Britian are aware on a

classified basis that arrangements are in progress to eliminate TOTIGER as a

SIGINT problem. The government of Switzerland is peripherally aware that

CIA is dealing with TOTIGER and Collins and has interposed no objection.

Indeed, for reasons that are unclear, the Swiss have encouraged the relation-

ship.

6. With the addition of TOTIGER to the stable of the TOARIEL and the

TOMINERVA operations as well as the inherent constraints on U.S. produced

equipment through the Office of Munitions Control, the large majority of cipher

equipment available in the market place to all but a few world powers will be

susceptible to analysis and intelligence collection efforts.

7. A NSA representative has informally stated to the undersigned that these

three projects will account for 90% of the intelligence "take" from diplomatic

third world communications. That "take" is estimated at 90,000,000 words

annually.

8. D/DS&T/OSO/SPB has stated that they will make every effort to keep

this Office informed of developments on a current basis.
