typewritten note dated May 5, 1972, prepared by Mrs. Erma Metcalf,

Mr. Hoover's Administrative Assistant, which includes information

indicating that the "Official - Confidential" files had been turned over

. **

to Mi. Felt on May 4, 1072, to days afler the death of Mr. Hoover.

Mr. Felt has contirmed receipt of these files.

Also located was a "List Ol Official - Confidential Files In

...

Director's Office, " dated October 20, 1971, which was prepared by

Mrs. Melcall. When the "Official - Confidential" files were inventoried

by the Inspection Staff in January, 1975, all of the lolders listed on the

October 20, 1971, inventory prepared by Mrs. Motcall were physically.

localed with the exceplion of three folders captioned with the names of

three present or former FBi officials. We have been unable to account

for the disposition of these three folders. It can be speculated that these

• folder's may have contained copies of communications, the originals of

which were maintained in the normal personnel files of these individuals,

and which may have been of particular interest to Mr. Hoover. The

reason these folders were removed from the "Official - Confidential!

files could not be determined.

The "Official - Confidential" files listed on the October 20, 1971,

inventory with the exception of the three folders, mentioned above, con-

• tinue to be maintained at fBI Headquarters.

Since their inception, the maintenance of the "Official = Confi-

dential" files was the responsibility of either Miss Gandy or Mrs. Metcalf.

_Mrs, Metcall has staled that these files were "very inactive" and it was

"very very seldom" that anyone needed anything from them. Miss Gandy

¡described these files as "not aclive" and stated they were referred to

in. only on rare occasions. Both slated that to their knowledge these files

• were never used' for other than,official purposes.

i..

Miss Gandy advised that Mi. Hoover lold her the "Official -

Confidential" files should be turned over to whoever was running the

. Bureau when he left.

She staled that she along was responsible for designating material

to be removed [rom Mi. Hoover's office aller his death and nothing of an

official nature, Bureau files or otherwise, was sent to Mr. Hoover's house

or elscwhere outside the Bureau. To emphasize this she said, "not

even his badge."

According to Miss Gandy, there were about 35 file cabinet

drawers of Mr. Hoover's personal correspondence which were packed il

cardboard buxes and moved to his home shortly afler his death. Afler

her relirement Miss Gandy spent about to months reviewing this per-

sonal correspondence for subsequent destruction.

She reviewed each

item and said she found nothing of an official Bureau nalure conlained

therein.

In addition to the personal correspondence, two 3-drawer and

two 2-draver file cabinets containing folders of material pertaining to

Mr. Hoover's personal business affairs were removed from his office

and moved in the recrcation room in the basement of his home.

The

material in these file cabinets included such things as copies of every

income las return filed by Mr. Hoover and separate folder's on each of

his slock and oil well investments. These file cabinets, with their cou-

lenis, are still at Mir. Hoover's residence, plus livo olher file cabinels

containing similar material relative lo the personal business affairs of

Clyde A. Tolson, which vere also brought to Mi. Hoover's residence

shortly aiter Mr. Hoover's death.

;.

Mr. John P. Mohr slaled, "There were never any Bure au files

Laken lo Mr. Hoover's house alter Hoover's death. " He participaled

in an inventory for tax purposes of the entire contents of Mr. Hoover's

home in July, 1972, and poinled oul that if there had been such files

there he would have seen them and he observed none.

During this inquiry we interviewed over 20 persons who had

bech at Mr. Hoor's house within a short lime aller his death. None

of the persons could furnish any information indicating the presence of

any official Bureau files al his residence.

It was the recollection of Raymond Smith,In Burcau truck driver, that

shortly after Mr. Hoovar's death

Ic delivered a lotal of 20 lo 25 file

cabinets lo Mr. Hoover's home and placed them in the recreation room

in the bascment. He said these cabinets were full and that during the

moving a drawer came open on one of the cabinets and he observed light

colored folders inside with the contents of each folder roughly one inch

thick. lie is umble to say where these file cabinets came from as they

were already on his truck when he received his instructions to lake

them to Mi. Hoover's residence. Inasmuch as no other persons inter-

viewed could corroborale that such a large number of ile cabinels were

stantialing or disproving that this occurred. At this point Smith remains

adamant that he did, in fact, bring 20 to 25 file cabinets lo the house.

•Of more than 20 persons interviewed who were at Mr. Hoover's

house subscquent to his death none ever recall seeing such a large nu-

ber of file cabinets. James Crawford, the careliker at Mr. Hoover's

house for many years, and füss Annie Fields, his cook and maid, wiio

were at the house daily are emphatic that there were never more than:

six file cabinets in the recreation room of Mr. Hoover's house alany

time and that Smith has to be wrong.

Il is the feeling of those who have interviewed Smith that he

believes he actually did deliver as many file cabinets as he has indicaled,

bul he is in fact confusing a number of instances. We have delermined

that a large number of cardboard boxes containing Mr. Hoover's per-

sonal effecls and memorabilia were taken lo Mr. Hoover's residence

from his office within about one week after his doath. Smith parlicipaled

a number of occasions in hauling this material to the house and into

the recreation room where most of it was stored. We have also delei-

mined that he was present and assisted in moving some of the six file

cabinels, previously mentioned, and have determined that at the time they

were moved some of these cabincts did contain light colored folders, the

contenls of which are approximalely one inch thick

Of the nearly 40 persons interviewed who were involved in moving

malerind, none. has any recollection of participating in the movement of

20 Lo 25 file cabinets lo Mr. Hoover's residence or ol seeing such a

number there.

We can only conclude that while honest in his belet

Tiguiry into Disposition of Files Maintained in

the Office of Former Director M. Edgar Hoover

Part of the request of the Altorney General was to determine

whether any official files had been removed from Mr. Hoover's resi-

dence following the death of Mr. Tolson. Inasmuch as cur inquiry has

shown that there were no such files at Mr. Hoover's home it follows

make inquiry into the movement of anything which might be construed

April 14, 1975, and found no such evidence.

It was determined, however, that shortly after Mr.: Tolson's

deith a number of empty cardboard boxes. were taken to Mr. Hoover's

residence by a Bureau employec. These boxes. were utilized by James

Crawford, the caretaker, to pack pictures which had been laying loose

in the attic and also to dispose of some oid canned goods. The boxes

with the canned goods were placed in the garbage outside.

In connection with the removal of material from Mr. Hoover's

home, it was determined that during the period of approximately the

middle of May to the middle of July, 1972, carchoard boxes containing

the personal correspondence of My. Hoover, which had been reviewed

by Miss Gandy at his residence, were picked up at the house on several

occasions and destroyed by personnel of the Washington Field Office.

•Also in connection with the removal of material from Mr. Hoover's

house, it was determined that on two occasions in 1974 numerous card-

board boxes containing books were removed from Mi. Hoover's home,

loaded onto trucks and delivered to the library at the FBI Academy,

Quantico, Virginia. These books hac been purchased by the J. Edgar

Hoover Foundation and donated to the library.

"WOMEN: A JOURNAL OF LIGRATION

3011 Guilford

Baltimore, Md. 21218.

SCRIPTIDA: WOMEN: A JOURNAL OF LiBERATION is a quarteriy magazine

Chrished by a gruup of women in Baltimore, Maryland. Subscription is.55 per year.

The newsstand price is S1.25. The journal is intended to be of use to women engagen

in struggle: strüggle for greater awareness and struggle to change conditions. The

journal seives as a iourt oí opinion and expression vital to a growing vomen's

liberation movement.

The magazine attem pis to push beneath the generalizations

and to foster the cication of an idcology.

Each issue centers on a soccific theme

relevant to the movement. No solicit aricles as well as poetry, short stories ard

art which iclates lo the spocific theme.

In moving beyond the general descriptions

of probleins, we dare tried to establish new approaches to the many intellestual

disciplines and to find now approaches to action.

7 Subscription io WOMEN: A JOURNAL OF LIBERATION is slightly different from

most magazines. Subscriptions are for the full year. This means that you ili

receive back issues if jou subscribe in the middle-of the year. This is necessary

because vie canno: eiford lo handle subscriptions by a subscription fulfillment house.

This makes il possile to serve our readers without going bankrupt

THEMES: We are past uf a movement of women who have become aware of our

oppression el lie some time time inai ve have, as americans, becoise corscious

through the ver in vietnam of the rcaiities of Amcrican power at home and abroad.

We find our gorcrument and its economic system guilty of exploitinz us at home and

and desecrating tas peopies of the third world for the economic berefit of the jew.

We know that in tis tainted contest we. can never be free.

Harrise shows rov an

aloitive ecouric system aïises out of the family siruciure: the suppression vi

bon is necessary to lie maintenance of such a system. As women, we are a key

Lasup in the crisos oi exploited peoples.

* Through tic lise of a separate theme for each issue of the magazine, a deeper

cxploration 0f lin ideag within the vomon's moveront has been cossihle.

rall 1969 "Women: Inherent dalure cr. Cuiturai Concitioning" Through an excleration

of biological dals, the magazine shows there is no basis in fact for a theory about thr

"inherent natare" of women.

The issue then goes on in explore bow women have been

conditioned lo acccat a secondary solc by schools, books and socicty.

Winter 1970 "What is Libcration?" Through a consideration oi the issues of birth

control, caucatioi, day care, jobs and family, the question of what women's liberation

involves is discussed.

Spring 1970 woren in, listory? & Recrention of Oui Past" Through a consideration

should be answered by roference to the Rogistration lot requiring agents of forciza

principals to register with the slave Department.

It is poinücd out, horerer, ihat

the classification "Registration Act" still exisis and investigations cónducied

under thai classification should not be confused with those conducted under the

classification "Internal Security."

It is believed that most of the information necessary about caci

You should ascertain the present home and business address of the subjeci

list referred to, such as current or past activilies, irfiliation with

organizations

engaged in activities in behalf of a foreign nation, participation in dangercus

subversive novements, advocacy of the overthrow of Government by force and viclenca.

It is deemed inadrisable to set forth specific vulos as lo the inrestig.-

being conducted, it is velieved. that little difficulty should do experienced in

J. EDGAR HOOVER, DIRECTOR

FECERAL, BURANJ DE LIVESTIGATTONI

I refer to lir. Tuneasts neaorandur to neidated June 28,

1943, which reviers the history, dovelopment, and meaning of the Special

Case rork and of the danger classifications that rere made as a part of

that vork.

After full re-consideration of these individual danger classifica-

tions, I am satisfied that they serve no useful? purpose.

The detention

of alien enemies is being dealt miti under tho procedures establissed

by the alien Enemy Control Unit.

The Special Case procedure has been

found to be valueless and is not use in thet connection.

There is no

statatory authorization or oter present justification for keeping a

"custodial detention" list oî citisens.

The Departuent fulfills its

proper functions by investigating ine activities of persons tho may bate

violated the lazi. It is not aided in this nork by classifying persons

as to dangerousness.

Apart fron these general considerations, it is nor clear to ze that

this cinssification sister is innerently unreliabie.

The evidence used

for the purpose of making the classifications vas insdequate; the stand-

ards applica to tire evidence for the purpose of mling the classifica-

tions vere defective; and finally, the notion that it is possible to

make a valia determination as to hoir dangerous a person is in the ab

stract and fithout reference to tine, environment,

and other relevant

circunstances, is impractical, unmise,

and dangerous.

EIVED: FROM

the forezoin reasons I an satisfied that the adoption of this

classification systen as a mistaié that sboulá be rectified for the

iccorangly, I direct that the classifications heretofore nace

Misa Candy-

CONFIDENITAL,

This is in reply to your memorandum to the Attorney General

dated September 9, 1960, inquiring about the possibility of pro-

secutive action against the leaders or designation of the captloned

organization under provisions of Exccutive Urder No. 10450.

The avillable

evidence concerning the activities of the

leaders and nembers of this organization falls

short of the

evidentiary requirements sufficient to meet the standarus"set forth

in the Jatos & cisivar Thile the leaders of the not at cimes re-

sort to the use of virulent and vicious language which would incite

the members to individual acts of violence 'against the white racc,

It is more calculated and designed to arouse hatred and antipathy.

against the white race as a race, rather than against the Government.

There is evidence of langage which speaks of the destruction of

America, but is couched more in teims of prophecy and

prediction,

often referring to the "far of Armageddon," than in terms of incite-

ment to action, Moreover, the First Amendment would require

something more than lunguage of prophecy and prediction and implied

threats against the Government to establish the existence of a

clear and present danger to the nation and its citizens.

Regarding designation of the WOI pursuant to the provisions

of Executive Order 10450, it is our opinion that hate-language em

plojed by the organization's leaders is not probativeof the criteria

of "subversive" nor is it sufficient to establish the 10I to be an

oiganization "... secking to alter the forn of government by

unconstitutional means.!'. Although there' is substantial evidence of

NOI's advocacy of futurc violent reprisals-for alleged wrongs com-

mitted against one or more of its nombers, the cvidence is

Insufficient at this time to meet the criterion that it has adopted

a policy of advocating or approving,the commission of such acts

of violence to deny. others their constitutional rishts

Agent cashes the check at a local bank and then pays the

informant the authorized anount in cash for which a receipt

is received from the informant and maintained in FBI

files.

Although there is no ovcrall memorandum of instruction

or document dealing with cost effectiveness as it relates to

informants, this factor is considered by the Special Agent

handling the informant, his supervisor, and the Spccial Agent

in Charge, Paynents to informants for

scrvices are inde

commensurate with the value of information furnished and

for actual expenses incurred in connection with obtaining

information for the FBI. Recommendations concerning

payments to informants on a regular basis receive careful

consideration at Headquarters level.

informants operated

under similar circumstances and providing

similar-type infornation, authority is extended at leadquartcis

to pay informants for services and expenses within prescribed

U.S. SENATE SLLECT COMITTEE TO STUDY GOVERIMENTAL

OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITILS (SSC)

Concerning warrants, a varrant requirement for

the use of informants appears impractical and may be

unconstitutional.

It is impractical because probable cause

usually is not available when the informant technique is

initiated and the submission of an affidavit in application

for a warrant vould incrense the hazard of exposurc of the

informant's identity.

Such a limitation night be unconstitutional

because it would limit the rirst Amendment rights o1 the

informant to communicate with the Governent. Existing legal

restrictions ifquire guided informants to recognize the same

Icgal limitations as would be applicable, in the sanc circum-

stances, to those directing the informants.

An informant can

legally do no more than an Agent is permitted to do.

The Bureau in the domestic intelligence aren has undoi

investigation organizations, most of which have numerous districts,

regions, offices, sections,

chapters and clubs.

These organiza-

tions and their subdivisions total over 1100, which receive

investigative attention to some extent.

These investigations

are afforded coverage by less than 1100 internal security

informants.

It must be recognized, however, that there are

other individuals who are in various singos of development in

this field.

Concernine payments:

one-half of one percent (.5%)

of the Bureau's budret (fiscal 1975) was utilized to pay all

types of security informants including those in the foreisn

counterintelligence field.

As noted, the Bureau's utilization of informants

involves a high dogree of care and supervision.

It is a

specific bureau policy that an informant nay only be

targeted

against individuals or organizations of investigative

interest to the rbI.

It must be recognized, however,

informants furnish a wealth of related information which

comes to their attention during the course of their assigned

duties.

While operating against assigned targets,

the

associations necessary to mintain credibility may lead to

information concerning proposed or nctual bombings, aisons,

violent demonstrations, assassination plots, a variety of

criminal activitics and even location of fugitives.

They

also. serve as listening posts in high crime and violence-

prone areas

and have contributed information directly

responsible for the arrests of 170 persons during fiscal

year 1975. Of this number, ll individuals were arrested

by IBI Agents and 17 IBI fugitives were located and

apprehended. Additionally tie FBI located 442 persons

and other federal agencics located 21 individuals.

Local and state law enforccent authoritics located 94

persons.

During the same time fraine,

internal security

informants provided information which led directly to

the recovery of property valued at approximately one-half

nillion dollars.

It must be further rccognized that a

warrant requirement for use of informants would virtually

climinate access of law enforcement to this collateral

information rosulting in many crimes going unsolved or

not prevented.

The IDI believes the clements of close

supervision, restraint, latitude and judgment are

essential in an informant program and it is further

believed that the proper balance of these elements is

being utilized by the FBI successfully in the operation

of informants in the security field.

1A

ATTACHMENT NO. 2

3.

1llcgal Activities.

Illegal activilies on the part of any employee, in addition to being

unlawful, refle-t on the integrity

of the FBI

and betray the trust and

confidence placed in

it by the American people.

Furthermore, unlawful

activities can disqualify him for employment by the Government of

the

United

States.

It 1s, therefore,

expected that employees will obey not only

the letter

the

law

but

the spirit of the law as well whether they be

engaged in

transactions of a personal or official nature.

With respect to

investigative activities, this admonition particularly applies to

entrap-

ment or the use of

any other improper, illegal, or unethical tactics in the

procurenent of evidence.

In this regard; it should be especially noter that,

in securing information concerning mail matter, the burcau will not

tolerate a violation of law (Title 15, USC, $§ 1702, 1703, 1708, and 1709).

Furthermore, employees must not tamper with, interiere with, or

open paii

in violation of law nor aid, abet or condone the opening of mail illegally

by-any employee of the U. S. Postal Service.

As members of a Federal investigative agency, FBI employces must at all

times zealously guard and defend the rights and liberties guaranteed to

all individuals by the Constitution.

Therefore, IBI employees must not

engage in any investigative activity which could abridge in any way the

rights guaranteed to a citizen of the lnited States by the Constitution

and under no circumstances shall employees of the FBI engage in any con-

duct which may result in defaming the character,

reputation, integrity,

oI dignity of any citizen or organization of citizens of the United States.

Employees must not install secret telephone systems os microphones without

Bureau authority.

No brutality, physical violence,

duress or intimidation of individuals by

our employees will ve countenanced nor will fort: be used greater than

that necessary to effuct arrest or for

self-defense.

I wanted to inform the President and you of the following information

i received from a reliable source concerning a meeting held by the Philadelphia

Chaoter of the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Pro-

fessions and the philadelphia Citizens Political Action Committee at the Academy

of lusic in Philadelphia on lay 26, 1940.

It is reported that Benjamin Papell, Executive Secretary of the

Philadelphia Chapter. of the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences

and Professions, originally desired to have &. I.. Whitney as speaker for this

meeting but that Serator Claude Peoper was subsequently chosen as the speaker.

=...

• Papall is alleged to have edited the speech of Senator Peoper made at the

meeting:

Papell is alleged to be closely alfiliated with the communist Party.

At the meeting in question, it is Isported that Senator Pepper stated

that the stubborn attitude of management and of the Gorerment was at fault in

I the railroad strike crises ard lurther that the Goverment had not net the union

half way. He daclared, according to the report, that the pricosed legislation

..gave the porer of life or death over everyone in the United States and that

under it business, the union or the union leaders could be ruined. He. called

""the proposed legislation not only an anti-strike, but an anti-liberal, anti-

labor and anti-civil rights type of bill.

He alleged it is part of a pattern

of raction and intolerance which is reaping the country and he reportedly

" expressed the hope that if the Senate could hold up the bill until the middle

i.of the week way 26 - June 1, 1946, it would be defeated by. the assertion of

J. the people's desires. He said that labor was the greatest organized militant

movement in existence and be expressed great approval of it.

Vita regard to foreign policy, Senator Pepper is said to have declared

that the United states is drifting toward far and that the United States and

Britisa coalition against the Soviet Union has resulted in Fussia not being

given access to the rest of the world and in being given improper consideration.

Ee clained there will be a war sooner than the time which elapsed between Morld

Honorable George I. Allen

Senator Pepper is said to have claimed that the foreign policy of this country

Is not expressive of American leeling and the present battle for power in

Germany 1s strengthening that country's position until it will again be a

(dangerous power in furope.. He advocated a division of Germany.

Senator Pepper is reported to have stated that the soviet union

should have a $2,000,000, 000 loan regardless of the type of goverment in that

country so long as there is a probability of repaynent and peaceful purpose.

He said that this country must erdeavor to see the soviet point of tier and

shot the soviet union we are its friend and not its enemy and, further, not

to operate diplomacy as if it were a chess gane.

Representative Rugh Delacy of Mashington also spoke at the above

described neeting, discussing the proposed labor legislation and the present

Coverent attitude, claiming it comparable to the attitude in Germany, Italy

• and Spain at the time of the ascension of "Fascists" to power. He said the

present bill is the longest step taken in any country toward militant Fascism

since the era of Hitler.

Liberals, he claimed, must organize and fight on a

national scale.

He said, according to the report, that the present united

states policy is being dictated by Hoover,

Tandenberg, Bymes ard Churchill.

arson Hells also spoke, declaring that strike breaking is the

begianing of the road to fascism and the only defense against it is to organize

around labor. He stated that the meeting in question was an anti-Fascist

meeting and that "Fascisn" may cone to merica, not. because reaction is so..

strong buú because progressives are so weak..

The meeting is said to have been endorsed by Sanator Joseph Gulley

and Congressman Milliam Green of Philadelphia.

¿notion was

passed that each

person presant wire or write their Congressman and Senators tö wipe out ithe

plot against Democracy."

It was also recommended that viras be sent to the

President expressing such sentiments concerning him as would be permitted by

the telegraph office.

I thought the foregoing information rould be of interest in vier of

the reliable report to the effect that the Independent Citizens Committee of.

the arts, Sciences and Professions is looked upon by the Coumunist Party as

one of its successiul organizational attempts.

garding this threatened strike.

ролойсіі"

On November 4, 1946 at a meeting. of the NFTW in Denver, Colorado,.

all affiliated unions agreed to a national bargaining program which would

embrace the majority of telephone workers presently operating under thirty-

three separate contracts, mainly in the Bell Telephone system. This national.

bargaining program purportedly will be inaugurated about January 1, 1947,

with the submission of written demands by member unions of the NFIN addressed

to the maragement.of telephone companies throughout the United States.

Actual negotiations are scheduled to begin approximately February 1,

1947, with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and large independent

telephone groups, such as the General Telephone System.

These negotiations

vill be undertaken on benalf of the NET by a newly created seven-member

Coordinated Bargaining Conmittee.: The demands, which will inclade ten national.

bargaining items, are:

-..

.. "

1. Union shop and check-off of union dues.

2.

Ceneral wage increases, which will depend on the vage-price

relationship existing next spring when the contracts expire

and how far out of line telephone workers' wages are with

wages in other industries.

3.

Area differentials, disparities in wages in different regions

Leaves of absence for union officers.

those with longer service.

In the event the union fails in its negotiations to effectuate the

above program, its leaders will call upon member unions approximately the

first of March, 1947 to file strike intent notices with the Labor Department

in compliance with the War Labor Disputes "Act's 30-day "cooling-off" period.

At this point a referendum will be taken through the entire embership of the

NFTH unions which have filed such notices with the Labor. Departrent and if a

vote favorable to a walkout is returned, the NITW has already appointed a

fifty-member policy committee to have full and sole power to call a natior-

wide strike at 6:00 All on April 7, 1947, or at a later date if deemed more

desirable. This policy committee is composed of one representative from each

• member union.

The informant stated that in the event this contemplated strike

actually takes place it would, in his opinion, cause a nation-wide tie-up of

all communication facilities.

He based his statement on the fact that practically

all telephone unions have affiliated with the NFTH. He indicated that the

.. notable exceptions are the United Telephone Operators of New Iork, an independent

the Chicago-Loop Telephone Workers, an affiliate of the International

Hothead as lette a tete terma tele Brotherer tre state os

Woriers, AfT; and about 10,000 telephone workers on the fest coast wao have

"is received concerning this situation.

POLITICAL ABUSE AND THE FBI:

STAFF REPORT

NO TAB

Ellifts crepierr)

Ta/з

P. 1874

Introduction

The political abuse of the FBI did not begin in the 1960's.

Although this Committee has concentrated its investigations on

the events of the 60's and 70's, the story cannot be fully

understood by. looking at just the last fifteen years.. Therefore,

the first objective of this report is to lay out some of the

historical context for more recent political abuses of the Bureau.

The

second objective is to describe some of the results of

our investigation which

show the various types of political

abuse to which the FBI is susceptible. Some have been in response

to the desires/ the Bureau's superiors.. Others have been generated

by the Bureau itself. And there is the added possibility, suggested

by some of the documents we have seen and

some of the witnesses we

have interviewed, that certain political abuses resulted from

the

inexorable dynamics of the FBI's intelligence gathering

process itself. In other words, that the FBI intelligence system

developed to a point where no one inside or outside the Bureau

was willing or able to tell the difference between legitimate

national security or law enforcement information and purely

political intelligence.

Whether any particular abuse resulted from outside demands.

from the FBI's own desires, or from the nature of the intelligence

process is a question for the Committee to answer when all the

evidence is in.

NO EXCISIONS

Historical Background

The historical background of political abuse of the FBI

involves at least three

dimensions. The first is the Bureau's

subsurvience to the Presidency, its willingness to carry out.

White House requests without question. When I. Patrick Gray

as Acting FBI Director destroyed documents and gave FBI reports

to Presidential aides whom the FBI should have been investigating

after the Watergate break-in, he just carried to the extreme

an established practice of service to the White House. The other

side of this practice was the Bureau's volunteering political

intelligence to its superiors, not in response to any specific

request. And the third historical dimension was

the FBI's

concerted effort to promote its public image and discredit its

critics.

Early examples of the Bureau's willingness to do the

President's bidding occur under Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1940

it complied with a request to run name checks, open files, and

make reports on hundreds of persons who sent telegrams to the

President that were - to quote the letter from the President's

secretary to J. Edgar Hoover - "all more or less in opposition

to national defense," or that expressed approval of Colonel

Charles Lindbergh's criticism of the President.

Another example came to light in recent years when Major

General Harry Vaughn, who was President Truman's military aide,

disclosed that President Roosevelt had ordered wiretaps on the

---

## Page 167

-I-

home telephones of his closest aides.

Shortly after MI.

Truman had taken office, someone had presented General Vaughn

with transcripts of the wiretaps.

He took them to President

Truman who said, according to General Vaughn, "I don't have

time. for that foolishness." This story is generally confirmed

by the Committee staff's inquiry into J. Edgar Hoover's

"Official and Confidential Files," where an index to the logs

of these wiretaps was located.

Historical illustrations of the FBI's practice of volun-

teering political intelligence to its superiors appear in

virtually every Administration. President Roosevelt's Attorney

General Francis Biadle recalled in his autobiography.how J.

Edgar Hoover shared with him some of the "intimate details"

of what his fellow Cabinet members did and said, "their likes

and dislikes, their weaknesses and their associations."

Attorney General Biddle confessed that he enjoyed hearing these

derogatory and sometimes "embarrassing" stories and that Director

Hoover "knew how to flatter his superior."

President Truman and his aides received regular letters

from Hoover labeled "Personal and Confidential" and containing

tid-bits of political intelligence. Sometimes they reported

on possible Communist influence behind various lobbying efforts,

such as activities in support of

civil rights legislation.

On other occasions they reported allegations that a Communist

sympathizer had helped write a Senator's speech and inside

sir:

16. 1162 D0014:32989584

Page 167

---

## Page 168

information about the negotiating position of a non-communist

labor union. Some of the letters were undoubtedly of political

value to the President. One related the activities of a

former

Roosevelt aide who was trying to influence the Truman Administration's

appointments. Another advised that the FBI. had learned from

confidential source that a "scandal" was brewing and that it

would be "very embarrassing to the Democratic Administration."

A third contained the report of a "very confidential source"

about a meeting of newspaper representatives in Chicago to plan

publication of a series of stories exposing organized crime and

corrupt politicians. The stories were going to be critical of the

• Attorney General and the President. The

Truman White House also

received a copy of an FBI memorandum reporting the contents of

an in-house communication from Newsweek magazine renorters to

their editors about a story they had obtained from the State

Department.

An example from the Eisenhower Administration shows how

White House requests and FBI initiative were sometimes mixed

Director

together. President Eisenhower asked/loover to brief the Cabinet

on racial tensions in early 1956. What the Cabinet reccived

was a report not only on

incidents of violence, but also on

the activities of Southern Governors and Congressmen in groups

opposing integration,

as well as the role of Communists in

civil rights lobbying efforts and the NAACP's plans to push for

legislation. No one appears to have questioned the propriety

IN 10162 D00T4:32989584 Pare 168

---

## Page 169

-5-

•w.

of the FBI reporting such political intelligence, or Director

Hoover's competence to do so.

The third source of abuse throughout the Burcau's history

was its concern for its image and hostility to any critics.

One example each from the Truman and Eisenhower years shows

how the Bureau checked and reported on its critics. In 1949

the National Lawyers Guild planned to issue a report denouncing

FBI surveillance activities revealed in a court case. The FBI

provided the Attorney General

advance information from its

sources about the Lawyers Guild plans, as well as a full report

on everything about the group in Bureau files.

Attorney General

Howard McGrath passed the reports on to the President, and

J. Edgar Hoover advised the White House directly about last-

minute changes in the Guild's plans. The FBI's inside infor-

mation gave the Attorney General the opportunity to prepare a

rebuttal well in advance of the expected criticism.

The second instance took place in 1960, when the Tennessee

Advisory Committee to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission announced

it would investigate charges by the Knoxville Area Human

Relations Council that federal agencies, including the FBI,

were practicing racial discrimination.. The FBI conducted name

checks on the eleven members of the council's board of directors.

The results were

sent to Attorney General William Rogers,

Deputy Attorney General Lavrence Walsh, and Special Assistant

to the Attorney General Harold R. Tyler, Ir. Derogatory

DasId-37989581 Paue 169

information on four of these individuals included allegations

of subversive connections from as far back as the late 30's

and early 40's, an allegation that one board member had "corrupt

political associates" in 1946, and the characterization of

another as having "unorthodox attitudes" and sending flowers.

and "mash" notes

to a woman in his church. The FBI's report

also made the flat statement, "As you know, this Bureau does

not practice facial segregation or discrimination." (The

Committee will recall that it has previously received information

as to the number of black FBI agents in the early 1960's.)

• Thus, the Bureau's more distant history shows the develop-

ment of its political services for higher authorities and its

concern for its own political position.

2.

"Name. Check" Abuses

The staff's investigation of alleged abuses in the 1960's

and 70's discloses a wide variety of questionable "name

checks", sonetimes for Presidents anä sometimes

in the Bureau's own interest.

An examination of these "name check" reports shows the

peculiarly damaging nature of the Bureau's practice. No new

investigation was done to verify the allegations stored away

for years in FBI files. Anything anyone ever told the rBI

about the individual was pulled together, including charges

that the Bureau may never have substantiated. FBI files

inevitably include misinformation because people bear grudges

HH 55162

DocId: 32989584

## Page 171

--1-

or make mistakes. Sometimes the Bureau verifies the charge;

but frequently there is no reason to do so, and it is just

recorded in

the files. Such charges can be retrieved by a

"name check" and reported without further substantiation.

The request by

the Nixon White House for a "name check"

on CBS

correspondent Daniel Schorr, which the FBI turned into

a full field investigation, has been examined extensively

elsewhere. The staff has determined that President Johnson

asked for "name check" reports on at least seven other journalists,

including NBC commentator David Brinkley, Associated Press

reporter Peter Arnett, and columnist Joseph Kraft..

Another political abuse of FBI "name checks" occurred in

the closing days of the 1964 Presidential election campaign,

when Johnson aide Bill Moyers asked the Bureau to report on all

person's employed in Senator Goldwater's office. Moyers has

publicly recounted his role in the incident, and his account is

confirmed by FBI documents.

Some of President Johnson's requests parallel those of

President Roosevelt twenty-five years earlier. The FBI complied

with White House requests for name checks on dozens of persons

who signed telegrams critical of U.S. Vietnam policy in 1965.

The names of other Presidential critios were also

sent to the

Bureau to be checked and reported on, as were the names of

---

## Page 172

critics of the Warren Commission. The FBI also volunteered

reports on Presidential critics.

The White House requests for "name checks" are episodic

in comparison to the "name checks" conducted as a matter of

systematic Bureau policy for the use of FBI Director Hoover.

The Crime Records Division prepared "name check" memoranda

Director

for/Hoover regularly on Congressmen, othei public officials,

and prominentipersons of interest to the Director. Many of

these

special memoranda were filed by the Crime Records Division.

Director

Others

found their way into/Hoover's "Official and Confidential.

Files."

The Committee staff has located in these "O and C

files" such special memoranda on the author of a critical book

about the FBI, and on all the members of the Senate Subcommittee

chaired by Senator Long which threatened to investigate the

FBI in the mid-1960's. Some of these "name check" reports and

special memoranda contained derogatory. information, and in the

case of the author, information from his income tax returns and

personal information about his wife. The reports on members of

the Long Committee were compiled in a briefing book, with tabs

on each Senator.

Therefore, these incidents demonstrate the potential for

abuse inherent in the Bureau's unregulated "name check" procedure.

White House requests by-passed the Attorney General, and the

FBI Director's own requests took place totally within the Bureau.

The real meaning of the long-standing fear that the FBI had

so-called "dossiers" on Congressmen and other prominent persons

was that FBI officials could have "name check" reports pre-

pared for his use on anyone he desired to know more about.

3. Abuse of FBI Investigative Powers

The next category is abuse of the

FBI's investigative powers. There is a vivia example under the

Kennedy Administration involving the FBI's late night and early

morning interviews of a Steel Company executive and several

reporters who had written stories about the Steel executive.

Former Assistant FBI Director Courtney Evans, who was informal

liaison with Attorney General Kennedy, has told the Committee

that he was given no reason for the request.

Another example arises out of the Bobby Baker case.

In 1765 the FBI declined a request of the Justice Department

Criminal Division to "wire" a witness in the investigation of

former Johnson Senate

aide Bobby Baker. Although the FBI

refused on grounds that there was not adequate security, the

Criminal Division had the Bureau of Narcotics in the Treasury

Department "wire" the witness as a legitimate alternative.

When the Baker trial began in 1967 this became known. Presi-

dential aide Marvin Watson told the FBI that President Johnson

was quite "exercised", and the FBI was ordered to conduct a

discrete "run-down" on the head of the Criminal Division in

1965 and four persons in Treasury and the Narcotics Bureau,

including specifically

any associations with former Attorney

General Robert Kennedy.

Another incident occurred in 1966 when Mr. Watson re-

DocId: 32989584

## Page 174

-111-

quested that the FBI monitor the televised hearings of the

Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Vietnam and prepare a

memorandum comparing statements of Senators Fulbright and

Morse with "the Communist Party Line."

At the request of President Johnson made directly to

FBI executive Cartha DeLoach, the FBI passed purely political

intelligence about

United States Senators to the white House

which was obtained as a by-product of otherwise legitimate

national security electronic surveillance of foreign intel-

ligence targets. This practice also continued under the Nixon

Administration at the request of Mr. H. R. Haldeman.

It is more difficult to

place the label "abuse" auto-

matically on Presidential requests for electronic surveillance

to investigate leaks of classified information. Attorney

General Kennedy authorized wiretaps in 1962 on New York Times

reporter Hanson Baldwin and his secretary, and they lasted for

about one month. The wiretaps under the Nixon Administration

of journalists and current or former White House and other

Executive officials have been widely publicized. The staff's

inquiry into this matter has determined that, according to

available records, at least one of these wiretaps had nothing

•to do with "leaks" and was conducted solely for personal infor-

mation about the target. Nevertheless, the wiretapping to

and KATZENBACH

investigate "leaks" under. Attorneys General Kennedy/and of

President Roosevelt's aides were undoubtedly precedents J. Edgar

HH 55162

## Page 175

-11-

Hoover had in mind when he told President Nixon and Dr..

Kissinger in 1969 that wiretaps had been used for these

purposes in the past.

Another abuse of FBI investigative powers under the

Johnson Administration was the surveillance conducted at th

1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City. L The

most sensitive details of the plans and tactics of persons

supporting the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party delegate

challenge went to the White House from the FBI's wiretap

on Dr. King, and other types of FBI surveillance: The re-

sponsible White House official at the time, Mr. Walter Jenkins,

has told the Committee that he can recall no political use

made of these reports. Nevertheless, an unsigned document has

been located at the Johnson Library recording at least one

political use of Mr. DeLoach's phone

reports.

As Theodore H. White's account of the 1964 campaign makes

clear,

the most important single issue that might have disturbed

President Johnson at the Atlantic City Convention. was the

Mississippi challenge. And the FBI's own inquiry into the

Atlantic City events reports several FBI agents' recollection

that one purpose of the Bureau operation was to help avoid

"embarrassment to the President." The Committee must weigh all

the evidence in deciding whether this abuse of the FBI resulted

from a White House request, from FBI officials volunteering in-

formation to serve and please the President, or from a legitimate

civil disorders intelligence operation which got out of hand

Pani

because no one was

willing to shut off the political intel-

ligence by-product.

It should also be noted that an aide to Vice President

Hubert Humphrey contacted the FBI to

request assistance at the

1968 Chicago convention. Nothing appears to have come of this

request, largely because Attorney General Ramsey Clark turned

down FBI requests

for authorization to wiretap protest demon-

stration leaders at the Chicago convention.

Finally, there are two additional examples of political

abuse of the FBI or by the FBI in the 1970's. In July 1971,.

three months after the supposed end of FBI COINTELPRO operations,

the FBI leaked to a newsman derogatory public record informa-

tion about Daniel Ellsberg's lawyer.

Copies of the article

were sent to the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General,

and Presidential aide H. R. Haldeman, with the specific

approval of

Director Hoover, with no indication it was generated

by the FBI. In May 1970, the FBI provided Vice President

Agnew at his request with derogatory public record information

and other allegations about Rev. Ralph David Abernathy,

the President of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

This occurred following a telephone conversation.

between Director Hoover and Mr. Agnew during which, according

to FBI records, the Vice President "said he thought he was, going

to have to

start destroying Abernathy's credibility."

Thus, in sunmary, political abuse of the FBI and by the

FBI has extended over the years through Administrations.of

both parties.

ADDENDUM TO STAFF REPORT ON POLITICAL ABUSE AND THE FBI: The

Johnson Administration and Mrs. Anna Chennault

According to materials provided to the. Committee by the

• FBI, President Johnson asked the FBI to conduct physical

LEADER

surveillance of Mrs. Anna Chennault/on October 30, 1968 in

the final days of the election campaign. The FBI instituted

this surveillance to cover her activities in Washington, -D.C.,

and New York City. The results of this physical surveillance

dissèminated to J. Bromley Smith, Executive Secretary of

the National Security Council, who had conveyed Johnson's

request to Cartha DeLoach of the FBI. On November 7; 1968,

Smith called DeLoach and stated that President Johnson wanted

the FBI to abandor. its physical surveillance of Mrs. Chennault.

Or November 13, 1968, at the instruction of President

Johnson, the FBI checked the toll call telephone records in

Albuquerque, New Mexico, to determine if Vice Presidential

candidate Spiro Agnew had called Mrs. Chennault or the South

Vietnamese Embassy on November 2, 1968, when he was

in Albuquerque.

No such

records were located. President Johnson was furnished

with this information on November 13, 1968. Also, the arrival

and departure times of Agnew in and out of Albuquerque on

November 2, 1968, were verified at the request of the White

• House.

The FBI has reviewed its files on this matter and has

advised that the apparent reason the White House was inter-

ested in the activities of Mrs. Chennault and Spiro Agnew was

to determine whether the South Vietnamese had secretly been

in touch with supporters of Presidential candidate Nixon,

possibly through Mrs. Chennault, as President Johnson was

apparently suspicious that the South Vietnamese were trying

to sabotage his peace negotiations in the hope that Nixon

would win the election and then take a harder line towards

North Vietnam.

The FBI also states that physical surveillance of Mrs.

Chennault was consistent with FBI responsibilities to determine

if her activities were in violation of certain provisions of

the Foreign Agents

Registration Act (Section 601, et seq.,

Title 22, USC) and of the Neutrality Act (Section 953,

Title 18, USC).

Further details of these events involving electronic

surveillance remain classified "Top Secret".)

SECOND ADDENDUM TO STAFF REPORT ON POLITICAL ABUSE AND THE FBI:

Additional Electronic Surveillance

In addition to the wiretap on New York Times

reporter Halson Baldwin in 1962, the Committee has

received materials from the FBI reflecting authorization

by Attorney General

Robert Kennedy of a wiretap on a

reporter for Newsweek magazine in 1961 during the investi-

gation of another, leak of classified information.

Further

materials reflect authorization by Attorney

General Nicholas Katzenbach of a wiretap on the editor

of an anti-Communist newsletter in 1965, also during the

investigation of a leak of classified information.

The Committee has received materials from the

FBI reflecting authorization by Attorney General Robert

F. Kennedy of wiretaps on at least six American citizens,

including three Executive Branch officials, a Congressional

staff member, and two registered lobbying agents for

foreign interests. The materials also reflect that these

wiretaps related to an investigation of efforts by

foreign interests

to influence United States economic

policies.

During the period when the Convention was actually in progiess, we

established a secondary command post at the Convention Hall Rotunda opcrated by an

civil rights workers in Mississippi. Furthermore, information was received

that the parents of one of these individuals would appear at a rally during the

DNC.

On 8/25/64 Assistant Director Cartha DeLoach telephoned a memorandum

to Mr. Mohr from Atlantic City to the effect information from Waller Jenkins

and informants indicated the question of seating the MEDY delegates was expected

to reach the floor of the INC the evening of 8/25/64. He said "The crucial point

of the convention in so far as possible violence is concerned will occur hetween

4:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. this afternoon.. If the Mississippi Freedom Democratic

Party is not seated then the unruly elements within the Negro group will possibly

attempt to demonstrate. " Deloach indicated that every effort was being extended

to cover developments pertinent to this possible violent situation.

There follows under appropriate caption in summary form information

relative to our coverage at ine DNC.

COVERAGE RELATIVE TO POTENTIAL CIVIL UNREST,

DEMONSTRATIONS AND LOSSIBLE VIOLENCE

A review of the summaries furnished to Walter Jenkins by Mr. DeLoach

during the DNC indicales over 25 separate entries dealing with demonstrations

insofar as their times, places, groups involved, number of participants, and

general nature thereof were concerned. A great majority of the Bureau person-

nel still on active duty who were assigned to this specialsquad in Atlantic City

have indicated that the attaining of intelligence information relative to possible

violent civil disorders was the primary purpose of their efforts during the DNC.

.....

Our coverage in this regard was handled through extensive informant

coverage at Atlantic Cily and as a result of information icceived from informants

in other parts of the country as well. Additionally, we utilized Agents in various

undercover capacities to develop such information.

Furthermore, a great deal

of information in this regard was, in fact, recried as a result of the technical

coverage utilized. Where appropriale, the information obtained was disseminated

• to the U.S. Secret Service and other interester law enforcement agencies as

assignment in part was related to the augmenting of the.U. S. Secret Service in-

sofar as the prolection of the President was concerned.. One Agent indicated

that Bureau personnel did, in fact, actively assist in the protection of the

President and his family while they were at the DNC.

A review of Burcau file [00-412527captioned "Disruption of Democratic

National Convention, Information Concerning (Internal Security)" did not reveal

any information directly rclating to the prolaction of the President.

A review of the DeLoach summaries to Mr. Jenkins indicaled one•

instance where a demonstration was planned to take place upon the President's

arrival at convention hall and another incident which revealed a breach of

security which allowed an individual to enter the convention hall and proceed

directly to the podium area. This information was furnished immediately to

the U.S. Secret Service.

Information is contained in the interviews of the former special squad

personnel that FBI Agents were utilized in supplementing U. S. Secret Service

personnel on the convention hall floor.

INFORMATION DEVELOPED OF POSSIBLE POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE

A further review of the DeLoach summaries revealed approximately

20 separate items which do not appear to relate directly with possible civil

unrest - demonstrations or with the protection of the President. These items

were developed as a result of the various types of coverage we had at the DNC

but a great number thereof were obtained through our lechnical coverage. A

sampling of these items includes the following:

--

'2. Informant information reccived that Congressman Acam Clayton

Powell was carrying i revolver.

3. Informant information relative to National Association for the

Advancement of Colored People Dlanning a mecting at a church.

4..

Informant relative to King's speaking before various state delegations.

Allegations in the press that the coverage of the FBI was used to

in any way by file reviews.

A review of the statements furnished by the special squad persomel

includes various instances where they relate a portion of their overall purpose

was to insure that there was nothing which would "embarrass the President."

to be gathered which would assure that there would be no such embarrassment.

! The only information localed in Bureau files concerning

the special squad in Atlantic Cily was an eight-page memorandum (copy allached)

with enclosure located in the file of DeLoach. This is a memorandum fron

DeLoach to Mohr dated 8/29/04 which sets forth that in connection with the

assignment of the special squad in Atlantic City at the direction of the President,

De Loach wished to report the successful completion of this assignment. He

Istates that by means of informant coverage, use of various confidential tech-

iniques, infiltration of key groups through use of undercover agents and through

utilization of Agents using appropriate cover as reporters, ve were able lo

Keep the White flouse fully apprised of all major developments. DeLoach also

advised that immediate liaison was established in Atlantic City with secret

Service as well as state and local police.

This memorandum refers to highly confidential coverage of Martin Luther

/ King and Bayard Kustin, along with similar coverage established on the leac-

quarter's of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) - Student Nonviolent

Coordinating Committee (SNCC). DeLoach states he was able to advise the

Jenkins at the While House and to his memorandum he attached a copy of these

daily summaries dated 8/24, 25, 26, 27/61, Those Summaries are in effect

a running log of developments which took place at the convention. DeLoach also

states he arranged for a lease line between the control post at Allantic City and

KU KLUX KLAN INVESTIGATIONS

FBI ACCOMPLISHMENTS

BACKGROUND

Historically, the problem of the Ku Klux Klan in

the United States has existed since the days of Reconstruction

lollowing the Civil far.

The Invisible Empire 1s well known

for its

terrorist, nighttiding activities and has been respon-

sible since Its Inception for numerous racial atrocities

throughout the country.

The Klan reached its peal. during the

1920s when it claimed millions of members and it became almost

defunct during

¡ Forld War IT.,

. In 19.54, with the historic

Supreme Court decision regarding desegregation of public

schools, it became revitalized. In 1964, with the passage of

civil rights legislation by the Congress, the Klan recruited

thousands of persons who feared the rise of. the Negro and

the threat to the "Southern way of life."

The Klan has usually been located in the South al-

though there have been attempts to organize it in the North;

Midwest, and far West. The Klan attracts individuals in the

rural areas who are poorly educated with limited incomes.

The Klan exploits the fears, hatred, and ignorance of people

who feel they are threatened by the Negro, the Jew, the

Catholic, and the fumigrant.

PRESENT STATUS

Presently there are 14 Klan organizations under

Investigation with a membership of approximately 14,000. The

largest of

these groups, the United Klans of Anerica, Inc.,

Knights of the Ku Klus Klan, with Headquarters In Tuscaloosa, -

ALabana, has an estimated membershid of about 10,000.!'

FBI RESPONSIBILITY

This Burcau has a three-fold purpose in investigating

the ku Klu: Klan and individuals associated with Klan organi-

zations: First, we investigate violations of Federal law

committed by the Klan with the view toward prosecution in

Federal court. Second, we conduct intelligence investigations

with the view tovard infiltrating the Ku Klus klan with infoi-

mants, neutralizing it as a terrorist organization, and deterring

violence. Third, 'we provide the Department with the results

of our investigations for possible designation of. Klan organi-

zations under Executive Order 10450.

were convicted in Federal court in Meridian, Mississippi, for

violation of the victims' civil rights.

An. 8th deferdant

Klan informants vere used as witnesses in this trial and

they unfolded a story of klan violence and terrorism rarely

Murder of Vernon Dahmer

In Januacy, 1966, Vernon E. Dahmer, a leader of

the National Association for the Advancement of Colored.

People in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, died as a result of

wounds received when his home was burned and shot into by

the Ku Klix Klan.

Iwelve klansmen have been indicted by

the Federal Grand Jury and the case is presently pending in

United Stätes District Court at Hattiesburg. FBI informants

were instrumental in determining in the early stages of the

investigation that

and the members of the

'White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi were

• responsible for Dahmer's death.

Murder' of Lemuel Penn

In July, 1904, Lemuel Penn, an Army Reserve

Lieutenant Colonel and Negro educator from Washington, D. C.,

was killed by shotgun blasts near Colbert, Georgia. An exhaus-

tive investigation by this Bureau resulted in the arrest of

four mambers of the Ku Klux Klan, Informants also played a

major role in this case.

In October, 1954, a Federal Grand

Jury returned an indictment charging six men, including the

four arrested for Penn's murder, with conspiracy to injure,

oppress, and threaten to intimidate Negro citizens in the free

were convicted and four were acquitted.

dramatically emphasized our penetration of the Klan when it

was publically disclosed that Rowe was an FBI Informant. The.

three defendants were indicted by a federal Grand Jury and

convicted in Federal court for conspiracy.

McComb, Mississippi, Bombings

From June through September, 1964, a series of

bonbings. occurred in McComb, Mississippi.

After intensive

FBI investigation; nine members of the Ku Klux Klan were

arrested and charged with bombing homes and churches at McComb.

These nine klansmen entered pleas of guilty. and nolo contendere

'in local court: FBI informants were instrumehtal in uncovering:?

the plot and identifying suspects.

New Bern, North Carolina, Bombings

In early 1965, a strategically placed informant: i

'enabled us to identify klansmen responsible for the bombing

of two automobiles and a Negro mortuary. in New. Bern,

North Carolina. This information was turned over to

local

authorities. Three defendants were convicted in State court.

Bogalusa Injunction

In Bogalusa, Louisiana, during the height of the

racial disorder in that conmunity in 1965, FBI investigation

led. to the obtaining of an injunction against the Anti-

; comnunist Christian Association also known as Original Knights

of the Ku Klux Klan.

This was a major, deterrent to further

Klan violence in that community.

Klan Terrorism, Rowan and Cabarrus Counties, North Carolina

In July, 1967, FBI investigations led to the arrest

and indictment of 12 nen in Rowan County, North Carolina.

KLAN INFILTRATION OF LAW ENFORCEEM

Law enforcement agencies have always been a prime

In 1964, wa lurnished information let of

were members of the Mississippi Highway Patrol. These men

were subscquently fired. Since that time rclations have

greatly Inproved rendering more eficctive the fair excrcise

It has been part of our established policy to notify

the head of the law enforcement agency involved

of any nem-

ber of his organization tho has been sworn into the lu klux

INTERVTERS OF KLANSMEN

One of the greatest attractions for lansmen is

the alleged cloal: of secrecy which surrounds their Klan

membership. Te have found that e program of selective inter-

viers of klansmen, where they are made aware of our knowledge

of their Klan affiliation, has done much to cause disillusion-

ment of the nembers and dismiption of the organization." In

some instances klansmen volunteer Information about the

organization and its activities. These Interviews also put

us in a position to assess eachumember with regard to his

potential as on informant. Although our Agents in conducting

their interviers are frcquently.met with hostility and threats

by militant klansmen, our Klan interview program has been most

effective in deterring violence and developifs informants.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

On Decenber 7, 1967, an Informant of our Mobile

Division learned of Klan plans to burn crosses in Montgomery,.

SUBJECT: Creation of Interdivision Information Unit

After consideration of the report of December 6, 1967, submitted

by Kevin I. Maroney, Thomas J. iNcTiernan, Hugh Nugent and James P. •

Iurner pursuant to my memorandum of November 9, 1967, I have deter-.

mined to establish a permanent unit, staffed with full-time personnel,

to take over and extend the activities of the so-called Summer Project

of the past iwo years. The new organization shall be known as the

Interdivision Information Unit.

The Unit shall function for the purposes and within the guidelines

• expressed in my memorandum of November 9 and the report of December 6,

1967. It is enough to state here that, in the main, it shall be responsible

for reviewing and reducing to quickly retrievable form all information

that may come to this Department relating to organizations and individuals

throughout the country who may play a role, whether purposefully or not,

either in instigating or spreading civil disorders, or in preventing or

checking them.

The Director of the Community Relations Service and the

Assistant Attorneys General in charge of the Civil Rights, Criminal and

Internal Socurity Divisions, with the last named acting as chairman and

principal overseer, shall constitute a Supervisory Committee to guide

the Unit in carrying out its functions.

Pending the selection of a head of the Unit, Kevin I. Maroney

shall serve as acting head and, with the assistance of the Supervisory

Committce and Messrs. McTiernan, Nugent and Turner, take action.

to bring it into operation as soon as possible. Necessary personnel.

SULLIVAN MEMORANDA TO JOHN DEAN

(SENATOR BARRY GOLDWATER)

Reference is made to my letter of January 30, 1975, setting

forth information in the "Sullivan memoranda." Your attention is invited.

to specifically Item 3 of this letter. This item is made up of two paragraphs.

The first paragraph states that President Johnson asked the FBI to loon

into members of Senator Goldwater's staff and give him the results. A reriev.'

was made and r'esults furnished some of which contains derogatory information.

We have located a work copy of a memorandum to Mi. De Loach dated

October 26, 1964, captioned "NAME CHECK REQUEST FOR WHITE HOUSE."

This copy states that Bill Moyers, Special Assistant to the President, requested

a special check ot the Burepu's files concerning percons employed in Sonate:

Goldwater's office.

Using the United States Senate telephone directory, 15

individuals were listed and a memorandum was attached reflecting the resuits

of the check. The recommendation was that Mr. De Loach furnish the mema-

randum to Mr. Moyers.

We are unable to locate a record copy of the above-describec

memoranda.

A record copy of a

letter to Mr. Moyers-dated October 27,

1964, is in file and was hand delivered by Mr. DeLoach on October 28, 1961.

This letter advised that there was no derogatory information in our files on

13 of the individuals mentioned. •

AN ANALYSIS OF FBI DOMESTIC SECURITY

INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS: AUTHORITY,

OFFICIAL ATTITUDES, AND ACTIVITIES IN HISTORIC PERSPECTIVE

Many persons who are currently examining the FRI's doniestic

security intelligence authority and the parameters of this jurisdiction began

their analysis at a mid-point in the history of this Nation's struggle against

the forces of subversion. This approach tends to result in a nechanical

examination of the subject without the benefit of an understanding of the

historical forces and necessities which brought about the need to conduct

domestic security intelligence investigations. In an eifor to clarify the role

the fill has played in this field, il is decmed appicpriate lo submit,this

concise review of historic events illustrating the evolution of the problem

of domestic subversion, attitudes of Government officials townics the probiem,

and how, against this historic backdrop, the FEI, came lo be assigned domestic

security intelligence responsibilities.

On September 24, 1789, the Office of Attorney General of the

•United States was created by Act of Congress. Not until March 3, 1871, Was

• there an effort to creale an investigative foree for the use of the Allorney General

in fulfilling his duties. In that year. Concress appropriated $50.000 for the

. use of the Autorney General "in the detection and prosecution of crimes against

the United Stales." From 1871 to 1909, the various Allorneys (eneral aypointed

"Special Apents," "Grueral Agents" and "Framinars" to assist him in the

detection of crimes. In some instances, investigative personnel from othei

ederal agencies were borrowed for this purpose. Their numbers were fei,

•d administration of their efforts was primilive. In an effort lo create án

¿effective investigative force, Attorneys General Charles 1. Bonaparte and

i George W. Wickersham, in 1908 and 1909, issued orders which resulted in

: the creation of the. "Burcau of Investigation," a division of the Department,

which, in March, 1909, was ordered lo be a separate unit of the Department

under the control and supervision of the "Chief of the Rureau of Investipalion."

. This Burcau, by 1910, was being referred for investigation all Federal crimes

not specifically assigned lo other Federal agencies.

Many today assume incorreclly that the FBI commenced domestic

sccurity intelligence investigations within the last several years. In fact,

the Burcau of Investigation, the predecessor of the modern FBl, was siven

foreign and domestic security responsibilities during World War I (WW I),

1917-1918. li will be made more apparent on revic of the following material

that many probirins and questions concerning domestic security investigations

of that cra parallel the problems and questions of loday.

!.:,

With the outbreak of hostilities in Europe in 1911, and this

Nation's participation commencing in 1917, a flood of ner responsibilities

faced the 300 or so Arents ot the Burenu of Investigation. Previously, their

responsibilities were limited to investigations of crimes on Government lands,

; bank and bankruptcy frauds, forgery. matters, bribery, and kindred oftenses.

With the coming of var, concein over potential sabotage aclivities and alien

propaganda few within the diation, and the Bureay was assirned aneir role.

No longer v'ere the Burchu's interests limited to the traditional areas ci criminal

investigation bur were now broadened to encompass matters concei ning internal

security and national diciense. In 1917, Congress enacted the Selecuve

Service and Training de, the Espionage Act, and the Trading with the

Enciny act, followed in 1918, by the Sabotage and Deportation Acts.

inforceinent responsibilities for the most part fell on the Bureau of

Investigation. To mect the added burdens, the Bureau was increased

10 approximaicly 100 Agonis, but, nonetheless, these were insullicient lo

handle the task.

To respond to the problem, Attorney General Thomas W. Gregory

and then Bureau Chief, A. Bruce Bielaski, conceived what they felt might

suffice lo answer the problem. The American Protective League (API,),

composed of well-menning private individuals, was formed as a citizens

auxiliary to "assist" the Bureau of Investigation. In addition lo the nuthorized

nuxiliary, ad hoc groups took it upon themselves to "investignte" whai they

fell wore un-American netivities. Though the intentions of hoth groups yere

undoubtedly patrintic and in some instances beneficinl, the overall result

was the denial of constitutional safeguarris anci administrative confusion.

To see the problem, one need only consider the mass deprivation of rigits

incident to the deserter and sclective service violator raids in New York

and Nei Jersey in J919, wherein 35 Agents assisier! by 2.000 APL operatives,

2,350 military personnel, and several hundred police rounded up some 50.000

men without warrants or sufficient probable cause for arrest. Of the 50,000

arresices, approximately 1,500 were inducted inlo the military service and

15,000 were reierred to draft boards.

It became clear that using citizen nuxiliary personnel was not

the answer lo national defense manpower problems.

Secondly, it was renlized that there was no central control of

nuthorized ngencies for coordinating, such investigations and correlating

the resultant prosecutive and intelligence intormation. An Agent when

asked in 1338, what probleirs were experienced during investigations in

WWI, stated:

"Ilow did we function with relation to other agencies,

both federal and state? In answering this query, i

might say that while our relationship with the Ariny.

ond Navy Departments, uns extremely cordial nt all

limes, nevertheless there was at all times an enormous

overlapping of investigative activities among the

various agencies charged with the winning of the

war. There were probably seven of cirht such active

o'ennications operating al lull force during var day's

and il was nol an uncommon experience for an Agent

of this Burcau to call noon an individual in the

course of his investigation, to find out thai six or

seven other Government agents rapresenting as many

other investigative agencies had been around in interview.

the party about the same matter. ... The experience

had in those days was so convincing in the lesson it

taught, as to make it certain that in the crent of

another World War, some central control should exist

to correct the old evils."

Two primary lessons were thus learned concerning investigations

of internal security mallers which would play a great part in considerations

'for such investigatons when the threat or potential of lorld liar loomed in the

1930's. It was evident that unprofessional and untrained citizens groups,

authorized or vigilante, could not be used as an officinl, functioning auxiliary

1o established investigative agencies. Secondly, even among trained,

•established agencies there was a necessity for centralized assionment and

control of investigation and correlation of the investigative product.

The preat "Red-Radical Scare" followed closely on the hecks of

• 1'781, apparently the social reaction to the aftermath of the War and the Russian

Revolution of 1917. The violence and anarchism associaler with the activities

of such "radients" were of concern to the Government and public alike. In

an effort to counter the radicals and anarchists, the Department and Burcau,

in conjunction with the Department of Labor, which had primary jurisdiction

over imnigrallon mallers, used the provisions of the "Deportation Statule"

as an answer. The following excerpes are from a confidentini letter to."all

Special Agents and Employees" from Director l. J. Flynn, daled August 12,

'.

"The Bureau requires a vigorous and comprchensive

• investigation of Anarchistic and similar classes,

Bolshevism, and kindred agitations advocating change

in the present form of Government by forçe si violence,

• the promotion.of serlition and revolution, bomb throwing,:

and similar activities. In the present stale di lhe federal

law this investication should be particularly directed

to persons nol citizens di the U'nited Stales, with a

view of obtaining deportation

cases.

"While you are required lo investiente particularly

with regard to aliens, you should also make iull

investigation of similar activities of citizens of the

Uniled Stales with a view lo securing eridence which

may be of use in prosecutions under the present

existing state or federal laws or under legislation

of that nature which may icreinafter be enacied.

..."

These investigations resulted in the much criticired "Paimer Red

Raids" of 1919 and 1020.

In 1912, J. Fdgar Hoover, a Departmental Attorney since 1917,

was placed in charge of the General Intelligence Division, Department of

Justice. The Division had the responsibility vi correlating information -

obtained by the Burcau for the purpose of preparing material for deportation

proceerings. As a Departmental.attorney, dir. Hoover not only observea

the wartime problens out experienced the difficulties associated with

intelligence-typc investigations while with the Division.

On Oclober 5, 1920, he prepared a report on the Cencral

Intelligence Division, which read in part:

:. :

"Following the mailing of bombs to prominent

rovernment officers in May, 1919, and the bomb

outrages of June 2, 1919, it became apparent that

i there must be established a systematic and thorough

supervision

over the unlawful activities of certain

persons and organizations in the United Stales whose

sole purposus were lo conmit nots of terrorism and lo

• advocale by word of mouth and by the circulation of .

liternture the overthrow of the Government of the

United States by force and violence. On August 1,

1919, there was forined as a part of the Department of

Justice, a GENERAL INTELLIGINCE DIVISION 10 handle

the investintions connecled with the radical activities

¡in the United States: :.. While the work of the

General Intelligence Division was at first confined

solely lo the investigations of the radical movement,

it has now expanded to cover more reneral intelligence

work, including not only the radical netivities in the

United States and abrond, but also the studiving of

. matters of an international nature, as well as cronomic

and industrial disturbances incident thereio.

...it was soon found that the jederal statutes were

inadequale to properly handle the radical situation

from a criminal prosecution standpoint. As is arcady

mentioned in this report, there is need in the absence

of legislation to enable the federal government adequatel;

to defend and protect itseif and its institutions of not

only aliens within the borders of the linited Stales, but

also of American citizens who are engaged in unlawíul

agitation. Consequently, the efforts of the Bureau became

contered upon the activities of alien agitators, with the

• objeel of securing deportation of such of these persons as

were violnting the provisions of the Act of Oclober 16,=..

. 1918, familiarly known as the "deportation statute."

Mir. Hoover further reported that within the overall operation an

indexing system as established for the retrieval of information, that anarchist

• socicties other than pure communist were investigated for "revolutionary

character," thai evidence was discovered linking radicals lo the steel and Conl

Strikes of 1919, and Railroad Strikes, 1920, that Their proparanda had been

infiltrated into the labor moveinent, that radical propaganda sas directed at

the Negro to foster racini unrest, that there were anarchists of various

Ideologies practicing within the linited States, that various states hnd grained

convictions under loeal criminal syndicalism statutes and others, and that the

Genernl Intelligenee Division, of necessily, had generated a library of radical

publications lo sludy the various overall theories and histories of the radicals

and anarchists.

In summarizing, Mr. Hoover noted in the report:w...

"Much of the work of the General Intelligence

Division has been cumulntive in nature; and the

collection of information has enabled this department

not only to achiev resulls in the more practical

application of the federal statutes to the unlawful

activities of the radicals in the U'nited States, but

has enabled the goverment to study the situation

from a more intelligent and broader vich -point."

Mr. Hoover', in his summation, stated very clearly that information

which the Burcau was collecting was being used by lie General Intelligener

Division as pure and valuable intelligence information i assess internal domestic

radical activity as carly as 1919.

The "lied Raids" generated a storm of criticism from such legal

scholar's as Penn Roscoe lound of Harvard, Felix Frankfurter, later Associate

: Justice of the Suprene Court, Charles Evans Hughes and liarian Fiske Stone,

both subsequently Chief Justices.

In addition, the Senate ludiciary Committee

launched an investigation of such prastices.

In 1924, Marlan Fiske Stone was appointed Attorney General of

the United Siales, and his concept as to the Bureau's roic, was quite clear:

"The Bureau of Investigation is not concerned with

political or other opinions of indivicuais. It is concerned

only with such conduct as is forbidden by the laws of

the United Stales. When a police system goes beyond -

these limits it is dangerous to the proper administration

of justice and lo human liberty...."

J. Edgar Hoover, who was appointed Director of the Rurcau of

Investigation by Allorney General Stone in 1024, followed this policy from its

inception. In a letter of May 14, 1925, he responded to an inquiry in point

by staling:

.!.

.!.

ROM

"...you are advised that from time lo time infor

ination concerning communist nctivities in the Uniled Stales

is voluntarily furnished lo field offices of the Burenu

by parties not connected therewith, the information

is forwarded to this office. However, the Bureau is

making no investigations of such activities, innsmuch

as il does not appear that there is any violalion of n

Federnl Penal Statute involved."

E.

Again, on Oclober 7, 1925, he responded to Colonel James l1.

Rcoves, General Staff, War Department, as follows:

"in reply therelo l beg to state that general

investigations into radical sclivities by our various

field offices were discontinued some time ago by reason

• of certain changes in policy, program procodure, elc..

instituted-upon instructions from the Department. Such

investigations as are now made are only inaugurated

upon specific instructions lon the burcau and are

dirceled upon definite reports of activitics which may

involve violations ol Federal laws or stalutes."

To compicle the picture of official FBI policy and attitude regarding

investigation of radical activities during the 1920's and carly 1930's, il mus.

he noted that intelligence-lype investigations wer? conducted on a very limited

basis and for specific purposes when requested by the ditorney General and

Sccretary of Sinie under the provisions of the Appropriations Act, 28 U.S.C.

533(3).

For example, on December 31, 1931, James G. Rogers, Assistant

Secretary of Sinie, telephonically contacled an Assistant Direclor io inquire as

1o whether the FBl had entered the investigation of the Clevcland, Ohio, and

• Easton, Pennsylvania, bomb "outrages" as an inquiry had been direcled io

State from the Italian Ambassador regarding prolection of the lalian Consuls.

He was advised the matler violated postal laws and no investigation was underway

by the Bureau. By letter of the same day, the Assistant Sceretry formally

requested the Department to direct the FiBl to "cooperate to the fullest possible

extent with the Post Offce Department" as the "occurrence so soon alter the

outrages in Faston indicates the possibilily that a widespread plot against

Italian officials and subicels may cxist." Ry January 2, 1932, after conierring

with the Assistant Quorney General, Mr. Hoover had directed the iniuation of

such investigation.

It is-opparent that the FBI from 1921 lo 1931, conducted general

domestic radical investications where the aclivity indicaled a violation of

rederal laws, where investigntions were specifically requested by State Mapart-

ment through the morney General, and otherwise obtained such intelligence-

type information only when volunteered by some nutside source.

of 1924, the Burenu had been changed. from a small force of criminal investigators

and, bechuse of duties periormed regarding radical notivities during and

shorlly after Wl 1, had become the recognized instruinent of the Federal

Government for the investigation of such malters.

Even though general domestic security intellisenee investications

were not being conducted during this period, other developments occurred with-

in the organization which made the later assignment of that responsibilily logical.

Between 1923 and 1935, ne FBI became the repository for identi-

fication records and fingerprints, thus creating on Identification Division. A.

compact was formed to exchange fingerprints with major nations, wuiform reporting

rules were made applicable to all personnel in FBl field offices which weir

strategically placed across the country, an organized program was initiated

1o train new Agent personnel and was thereaiter extended lo other law officers,

and the FBl Laboratory was created.

These and othor growth factors greatly

broadened the FRl's inhercht epability to perform future intelligence assignments.

of equal significance was the passage by Congress in tIny and

June, 1931, of numerous federn crime bills which chlarred the FRI's responsi-

bilities in the criminal field to incluce among other things investinations of

bank robberies. extortions, kidnapping matters, Furitive Felon act cases,

Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property cases, and assaults on Federal

officers.

These Saclors, of course, crented no explicil authority in the FRI

do conduct domestic security intelligenee investigations but they most reinitciy

crealed an organization with all the assels, composition, and capabilities

for' conducting such investigations it so directed.

: Though the Departmental and Bureau policy from 1924 lo 1934

was to not engage in general domestic security intelligence investigations,

the communist-anarchist problem was ever present and of freat concern to the

public, the Exccutive, and Congress. The "red radicals" and anarchists

were no longer alone in the field; however, for in the carly 1930's, National

Socialism, the Nazi parly idcology of Adolf Miller, grew to power in Germany

and anti-Semitic, anti-racial propaganda was being peddica by dazi opcratives,

alichs and pro-German Americans' in the United Stales.

During the carly 1930's, various elements in Congress were

anxious for the Fill to chle domestic intelligence investigations against both

communist radicals and the Nazi movenient.

Commencing in 1930, Hamilton Fish, Jr., then Chairman of a

House Committee investinting communist and radical activities, contacted

and corresponded with the Department and the Bureau regarding proposed

legislation which would allow the FBI blanket nuthority to investigate

"Communist and revolutionary netivily." On December 17, 1931, House

Bill 5659, was introduced which read in part,

"(The FBI) is herchy authorized. and empowered

to investigate the revolutionary propaganda and activities

of communists in the United States, and of all entities,

groups or individuals who teach. or advocate the

overtios by force and violence the republican form

of government (the Fll) is hereby hiso huthorized

lo cooporate in its investigation with the other depart-

ments of the Government and with various state and

municipal authorities."

The Burenu's position in response lo all inquiries and requests

through this period, hourver, can be summarized in dr. Hoover's comments

made Janunry 19, 1031, wnerein he advised the Congressman that he "thought

it beller not to expand the power of the (FRI), since the Bureau has never

been established by legislation, but operates solely on an appropriation bill" and

further, that "it would be better to made it a crime lo participale in such activities."

He continued, "the Burenu operates under an appropriation act, 'Detection and

Prosecution of Crime,' and all the Rureau would need would he legislation

making it a crime lo participate in certain activilies." He staled, "if the

Burcau is given special power to investignte (activities not subject to the •

penal las:) il would be in the position of having a mass of material with which

nothing could he done, because there is no legislation to take care of it." On.

January 2, 1032, Mr. Inover direcied a menorandum to the Attorney General

in regard to the proposed legislation and noted:

"The conditions (relative to investigations for the

purpose of prosecution) will materially differ were

the Mureau lo emhark upon a poliey of investigative

•activily imto conditions which, from a Federal stanci-

point, have not been declared illegal and in connection

with shich no prosccution might be instituted. The

Department and the Bureau would undoubtedly he

subject lo charges in the maller of allosed secrel and

undesirable methods in connection with investigative

netivitios, is well as to allegations involving charges

of the use of 'Agents Provocaleur.'"

In Delober, 1933, Director Hoover submitted a memorandum lo

William Stanley; Assistant lo the Attorney General, lo advise of a meeting with

Immigration Scrvice personnel representing the Commissioner Genern) of

Immigration wherein Hoover was told by these persons that "the President

had indiented a desire that a joint investication be made by the Immipration

nuthorities and by this Division of the Nari propagand in this country."

Hoover advised that he responded:.

"I informed (the morting) that we had received

in this Department a number of requests for investi-

Rations of this character from outside parties, but that

lo dale no violations of a liederal criminal statute

had bech submitted, and consequently no investigation

had been initiated. I stated further that I had not

icceived ony word from the Attorney General indicating

that any action should be taken in this malter."

On Oclober 7, 1933, Congressman Samuel Nickstein called a

subcommittre of tie Committee on Immigration lo investigale the Mazi movement

and requested Agents from the Bureau lo assist in the investication. The

request was denied through the Attorney Cieneral. On the other hand, when

a warrant was issued for Heing Spanknochel, a German operative, for violation

of Section 233 of Tille 22, and Congressman Dickstein requested assistanee

in locating the fugitive, the Direcior's nole on a memorandum of November 20,

1933, leads, "See that rurry difont is made to alreet Spanknonbel's arrest if

he is still in U.S., 12/5/33, J.F.H." Where laws were violnted, there was

no hesitancy to enter an investigation of Nasi or communist activily.

On March 28, 1934, Mr. Hoover atlended an executive mecting

with the House Committee on Accounts, Conpressman Warren, Chairman,

wherein he was gucried as lo what investigation the Pureau had conducted

regarding "Nari activities, Communist netivities, and other subversive

movements, and further, whether the carrving on of in investication by the

Congressional Committee under the Dickstein Resolution (rould interfere)."

•He reported to the Atorney General that his response was that no such investi-

fations were being conducted as no lows had been violated, save in the

Spanknochel cass. He further reported to the Altorney Cieneral that a request

had also been made by the Commitlee for Agent assistance in the congressional

investigation and he had spoken aminst this procedure as it was not a "fact-

finding investigation" for the purpose of prosccution.

Il would appear that the policy of the Department and the Kureau

would preclude entry into any goneral or intelligence-type investigations of

vere to cause a departure from previous policy restricting investigations lo

polential violations of laws reinting lo domestic security. Direct instructions

from the President former the basis for limited intelligence-lype investiration

of the Nazi movement in 1934 and, in 1936, for broader investigation of sub-

versive activities in the United States, particularly Fascism and communism.

• The following material will explain this departure from previous policy,

predicatod upon the issuance of Presidentini instructions direclly relating to

the Chief Executive's constitutional responsibilities.

On May 8, 1931, Mr. Hoover appeared al a conference at The

White House attended by President Franilin N. Roosevelt, the Attorney

General, the secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Inbor, and the

Chich of the Secret Service. The topic'of concern was the Nazi morement in

the United States. As a resull of the conference, floovei recorded on May 1u.

1934:

"...il is desired that a very careful and searching

investigation be made of this movement, with particular

attention lo be given lo activitins indicating that either

• the German Embassy or the German Consultes through-:

out the t'nited States may have connection with this

movement. "

Mr. Hoover continued,

"It was agreed that it would he desirable lo have

one clearing house for information upon this activily,

and since the only federal law that might be applicable

1o it at the present time would he the Immigention law,

it was decided by the President that Colonel MacCermack,

Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization, would

confor with Mr. Moran, Chier of the Secrel Service,

and myself at an carly dale, for the purpose of sorking

out the details of this investigative activily.

' "f on desirous that you irmedialely prepare

confidential instructions to all of our field offices,

directing them to initiate an intensive investigation

• of activities of the Nazi promp, with particular

reference to the anti-racinl notivities and any anti-

American activilies having any possible connection

with official representatives of the German rovern-

ment in the Uniled Stiles :

•"!.

"The investigation should be considered as a so-

called intelligence investipation, that is lo. say, the

reports should be prepared in one general summary

at specified intervals in order that the Altorncy

General may have them inade available, and in turn

make them available to the President."

On May 10. 1931, instructions went lo all field offices to conduct an.

intensive investigation of the Nazi movement with particular i'clerence lo anti-

• racial and anti-American activities having any possible connection with official

representatives of the German Government in the United Stales.

It is readily reconnized that this Presidentin instruction was not

a sweeping and general assignment to conduct de nestic security iniellicence

• investigations, but rather lo conduct an intelligence investigation vithin

specified guideiines. Nonetheless, here, based upon a Presidential Directive,

the Bureau departed from past statutory policy and immediately initiated an

intelligence investigation, which by necessity, involved aliens and United States

citizens and was conducted for the primary purpose oi informing the Aitorney'

General and the President as to the general activitics of the movement.

This investigation of the Nazi movement, conducter along the

specifico guidelines .set by the President, was not expanded to include investi-

gation of such communist or radical movements whose purpose it was to over-.

throw the Government. In a memorandum dated Oclober 2, 1935, for the

Acting Attorney General, the Director notcci in his response to a Stale

Department inquiry as to the feasibility of exchanging radical information:

with foreign police, sources:

"At the presint time the investigative nctivity

of this Bureau is restrialed, in matiers of this kind

(communist and radical matters) to those activities

which constitute a violation of some Federal stalute.

The only Federal sintutes generally considered as

applicable lo such matters are these relating to

t'cason, sabolage, espionage, and the transportation

of munitions of warfare lo those nations which are

the subject of a Presciential proclamation prohibiting.

such shipment of munitions of war. In the absence

of any Federal statule specifically pchalizing the

$ 1915

- 12, -

"...

HH 55162

DocId: 32989584 Page 255

---

## Page 256

Communistic or other radical activities aimed at

the overthrow of the Government, no investigation

is conducled into such matters, in view of thie

absence of the necessary clements to establish a

violation of the Treason statule.

"Very little information is obtained by this Rurcau

, relating lo the activities of these radical niganizations,

which advocate the overthros of the l'nited States

Govermment. Il follows, of course, that information

of this kind is of no value when existing laws do not

permit a prosecution of the peisons engaged in

advocating the overthrow oi the Government, and

consequently, if information is received in foreisn

countries concening organisations. having for their

purpose the overthrow of the Federal Government and

this information is transmilled in this Bureau, the

Burcau would, of course, be powerless lo act upon

the information furnished, unless it constituled some

violation of a Federal statule within the Burcan's

jurisdiction. Twill, however, he flad in receive

at any time, information from any forcion police

department, which pertains to organizations established

for the purpose of attempting lo overthrow this

Governmchl, and will in the event the Pureau can

lalie no action upon the information furnished transmit

the information to those Governmental agencies who.

may be interested in the material obtained."

As Jate as July 13, 1936, correspondence with various parties

reveals that the Rureau was conducting no general intelligence investigations

concerning communism and radicals.

Once again, however, as in 1934, a specific Direclive from the

President changed the investigative policy towards conducting intelligence

investigations of communist and radical activities. On Aupast 21, 1936,

Direclor Hoover, representing the Department in the Altorney General's

nosenee, was summoned lo The White House by President Koosevoll. As

reflected in to memoranda by air. Hoover, dated August 21 and August 25.

1936, the President "was desirous of discussing the question of the subversive

-

activities in the United Stales, particularly Fascism and Communism." Hoover

recorded that the bresident slated he had been concerned about the communist

a 111?18:

• and fascist movements and "what he was interesled in was obtining a broad

picture of the veneral movement and its activities as may affect the cconomic

and political life of the country as a whole." Hoover continued, "I told him

that there is at the present time no rovernmental orranization which is fetting

any so-called 'general intellirence information upon this subject. He inquired

what suggestions I might offer relative to this maltei." Hoover recorded that

he responded lo the President as follows:

"I told him that the appropriation of the Federal

i! Burcau of Investigation contains a provision that it

might investigaie any matters referred lo it by the.

Department of State and that if the Sinie Deparument

should ask for us to conduct such an investication we

could do so under our prescht authority in the

appropriation abroady sranteci." (Emphasis Acided)

Many who have quichly read through this sentence and compared

it lo the overall subject matter of the conference draw the immediale conclusion

that since the provisions of the appropriations det were relind on, and since

the Scerctary of State made the request, it naturally followed that State and

the President were interested in only foreign or foreim-controlled subversion..

On caraful reading, and canmination in licht of the historic setting, it is

apparent that the President and Hoover were calkit shout noncy, not

jurisdictional limits. The President wanted a broad intellicence investigation

conducted not for purposes of prosecution and inquired of Hoover if the FBI

could supply the product. Hoover responded by informing the President that

money had been appropriated by Congress under the Appropriations Act and

1o netivate the provisions for justifiably using the funds would require a

request from the Secretary of State. The Fil could, of cours?, conduct no

investigations for which Congress had not provided appropriations. The

final topic discussed at the dumust 24, 1936, meeting was the Presidenl's

desire that Hoover coorcinaic the investigation with the "Military and Naval

Intelligence Services. "

On August 25, the President, Secretary of Sinte and the Director

met at The While House. The President rolated his concern over communist

and inscist activities and, according In Hoover, stated that he was "very.

desirous of having a survey made of these conditions and infoined the

Scerelary of State that this survey could be made by the Department of

Justice if the Secrelary of State requested the Department to conduct the

inquiry under the FBl Appropriations Act." He further recorded that such a

:.'

request from Stale would be fully justifinbir and logical ns these movements,

@particularly communism, were international in scope and, therefore, fell

within the interests of forcion affairs "over which the State Repartment would

‚have a right to request an inquiry to be made."

It is clear that the involvement of the State Department in the initial

arrangemunt did not serve in some way to limit the scope of the investigation

lo foreign or foreign-controlled activities to the exclusion of domestic. The

President desirod "a broad picture of the general movement and its activities

as may alicci the economic and political life of lhe country as. a whole," and

there is nothing contained in his request to suggesi the intent lo exclude

domestic security intelligence coverage. .

Mr. lioover's understanding of his assignment is illustrated in

o memorancum lo one of his assistants dated Soplember 10, 1936, wherein he

sinted he discussed the President's orders "lo have investigation made of the

subversive activities in this country, including Communism and Fascism"

with the Attorney General and was given his concurrence. The former

-Director's understanding as to the scope of the President's instruction is

further reflected in a memorandum to FBI field offices, dated September 5,

1936, which states in part:

• "The Burcau desires to obtain from all possible

sources information concerning subversive activities

being conducted in the United States by Communists,

Fascisti, and representalives or advocates of other

organizations or groups adrocating the overthrow

or replacement of the Government of the l'nited States

by illegal methods. No investigation should be initiated

into cases of this kind in the absence of specific

nuthorization from the Bureau, but you should forward

lo the Burcau information obtained from all sources,

and in those cases in which investigation is desired

the Burcau will issue appropriate instructions to

you. It is desired, accordingly, that you immediately

transmit lo the Bureau any information relating to

subversive retivities on the part of any individual

or organization, regardless of the source from which

this information is reccived."

The entry of the Bureau into the new field of domestic scurity

intelligence investigations necessitated the creation of noministrative procedures

lo handle the incoming information. By memorandum dnied August 28, 1936,

an assistant submitled a tentative outlind for the manner in which it was

iccommended information concerning suliversive activities be maintained

at Headguarters. He outlined the following "peneral classifications":

Maritime Industry, Governent alfairs, stecl industry, conl industry,

newspaper field, clothing, garmer. and fui industry, general strike

nctivities, Armed Forces, educational instilutions, general activities--

•Communist and Affiliated Organizations, Fascisti, Anti-Fascisti movements,

..and activities in Organized Labor organizations. Alr. Hoover noled on the

memorandum that this was a good beginning.

duddin this manner then, the Bureau entered fully into. the field of

domestic security intelligence investigations.

By Jolter of Oclober 20, 1936, Altorney General Homer Cummings

• forwarded to the President a memorandu from Ditcor l'oover wherein licorer

....

outlinee for the P'resident the general scope of the FBI intelligence effort anci

the arcas of coverage being afiorded. This memorandum reads in part:

"The purpose of this memorandum will he to

Prescht the present purposes and scope of the three

phases of domestic intelligence handled by the three

intelligenec services of the l'nited States Coreinmen!,

namely, the Military Intelligence Division: the Difice

of Naval intelligence; and the Federal Bureau of

Investigation, toRether with suggestions for expansion

and such further coordination as may be effected

for rcarly rcferenee information dealing with various

forms of aclivities of either a subversive or a so-

called intelligence type. In addition lo the limited

personnel of the Purenu riving their full time lo this

work, each of the forty-five field divisions has

..

developed contact with various persons in proiessional,

business, and law enforcement fields for the purpose

of obtaining information along the lines above indicaled.

"In order that there may be a clear view of the

detailed information covered, there is set forth the

following break-up of the various subjects that

• appear in the files of the Intelligence Section;

Maritime; government: industry (sieel, automobile,

coal mining, and miscellancous); general strike;

armed forces; equentional institutions; Fiscisti; '

Nazi; organised labor: Negroes, youth; strikes;

nelspaper field; and miscellaneous. Any infor-

mintion of a subversive or general intelligence

character pertaining to any of the acore is received

at the FBi headgunrters at tie Seat of Covernment and

is reviewed, summarized, and placed upon editorial

cards which are filed by name of the subject matter...

as woll as by name o! the individual, so that it is

entirely possile lo find in the incio: the collection

of names of individuals engaged in any particular

activity, either in any section of the country or in

a particular industry or movement. Indicative of the

present size of this index, there are approximately

2,500 names now in the index of the various types

of individuals engaged in activities of Communism,

Nazism, and various types of foreign espionage.

MIn addition to the above information that has been

collecled, the FBI has developed a rather extensive

Jibrary of fencral intelligence matters, including

sixty-five daily, cekly, and monthly publications,

as well as many pamphlets and volumes dealing with

general inielligence activilies. All of these have been

indexed not only as to tille and author, but have been

classifica as lo name and subject, and supply a fertile

ficld of information on the subject of general intelligence

netivities in this country.

"Al the present time the three intelligence services,

namely, the Military Intelligence, Office of Naval,,

Intelligence, and the Fll, lave develoned a close

and coordinated plan of cooperation, not only si the

headqunters in Kashingion, but in many of their

Corps areas, Naval Pistricts, and Field Divisions

available. ... Likewise, information that is reccived

by any one of the three branches of the intelligence

service of interest to any of the other branches, is

made immeriiately available, so that there does exist

today a structure of coordination and cooperation that

has been in operation for many jears and has been

working as satisfactorily as could he copected under

•subversive activities. Consequently, this pro-

vision is believed lo be sufficiently broid to cover

any expansion of the present intelligence and counter-

espionage work which it may he deemed necessary

to carry on.

MIn considering the steps to be taken for the

ris expansion of the present structure of intelligener

work, it is believed imperative thni it be proceeded

with the utmost degree of secreey in ordor to

avoid criticism or objections which might he

rnised to such an expansion by either ill informed

persons or indiricials having some allerior moive. i

The word 'espionnge' has long been a word that

has been repuenant lo the American people and il

is believed that the structure which is already in

existence is much broarer than espionage or counter-

espionage, but covers in a true sense real intelligence

values to the three sarvices interested, namely, the

Navy, the army, and the civilian branch nf the

Governinent--the ilepartment of Justice. Consequently.

il sould seem undesirable to seel only specini legislation

which sould draw attention to the fact that it was

proposed lo develop a special counter-espionage arive

of any great magnitudo."

Hoover thus confirmed in clotailed and ostensive manner not only

the mechanics and procedures establisied to comply with the President's

instructions, but also revealed in his memorandum a clear insight into his

understanding of the scoor of the investiration ordered hy. the Chiot Executive.

President Roosevell, on November 2, 1935, personally advised the former

Director that he approved of lover's plan, thus confirming that there was a

mecting of the minds amond the primary participants. dir. Moover recorried

on November 7, 1935, that on lovember 1, 1938, he was called hy Mr. Early,

Secretary lo the President: who told Hoover that the President desirer that he

board the Presidential Special Trnin on November 2, 1938, for a conference

with President Koosevell. Mr. Early was unaware of the lopic to be discussed

o1 whether Mr. Hoover sins lo accompany the President to llyde Park.

Mir, lioover's memorandum recording this conference reads in port:

"Secondly, the Presidont advised me that he had

that day communicated with the Director of the Rudget,

Mr. Nell, and instructed him in include in the

Appropriation estimates 550, 000 for Military Intel-

lipenee, 850,000 fo, aval Intelligence, and

$150,000 for the Federal Burcau of Investipation

lo handle counter-espionage activities. He stated

that he had approved the plan which I had propared

and which had been sent to him by the Morney

General, except that he had not been able to grant

the entire amount of money indicated as necessary

for cach of the three agencies, but lind authorized,

the amount which he stated r advised fly. Boll lo

... The special train was held until the

conference with the President was concluded and y

left the train at New York. "

The world situation steadily worsened during the 1930's. Adolf

Hitler' rose lo power in Ciermany; Haly turned to Fascisin: Russian communism

was threatening: and inpan made overtures of imperinlistic expansion.

Austrin joined the Third Keich in March, 1938, and Cacchoslovakia was

occupied on Sepiember sû. The dioscow-Berlin Non-Aggression Pact oi

August 23, 1939, aligned both the Nazi and communist forces and on September 1:

1939, Poland was attacked by Germany. Britain and France, allied against

Germany, declared war and on September 17, Russia also invaded Polish soil.

Border nations loppled lo either Russin or Germany in succession. Amid this

• chotic world situation the United States attempled to sland neutral; neverthe-

less, the danger of potential espionage, sabolage, and subversion was of paramount

concern.

As the intelligence and law enforeement agencies, both Federal

and stale, geared to mect the anticipated sabolage and subversive threats, it

soon became apparent that the lessons of World War Iwere not well learned by

most. Various federal investigative agencies commenced uncoordinated and

decentralized investipation of reports of subversion. Some even prompled

lochl citizens' groups to assist their efforts, much reminiscent of the American

Proloctive Longue ind various ad hoe troups formed for that sune purpose

during World War 1. In response to this growing problem, the lureau

recommended remedial action through the Attorney Cieneral which resulted

in a loller dated february 1, 1030, being diceled lo various Pederal

department houds from Joscph B. Keenan, Assistanl to the Attorncy Gencral,

which stated in part:

"I lake pleasure in informing you that in cooperation

with the Military Intelligenee Division of the War Depart-

ment, the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the Department

of Justice has undertaken lo investifate mallers relating lo

espionage and subversive activities.

"in order that such matlers he handled expeditiously,

il will be appreciated if you will instruct your personnel

that in case any inforination is recrived concerning the

above-mentioned matters such inforination should be

promplly forwarded to the nearest field oftice of the

Federnl Bureau of Investigation."

Here is the fst effort of the Tepartment and the FRil lo prevent the

confusion, delays, and violation of personal rights incident to such investigations

during the previous war. The Department and the Bureau saw cold logic in

this appronch as, since Wl! 1, the FBl had been the prime mechanism for the

investigation of espionage, sabotage, and related statutory violations and,

since 1936, in conjunclion with the military and naval intelligence services,

had been conducting domestic intellipenee investipations, Ercondly, the

Department as responsible for prosecutions of such statutory violntions and

the diorney General hnd been working closely in the field of intelligence

investigations. Thirdly, the Fill's internal composition, administrative

structure, and capabilities were such as lo make il the logical agency lo

conduct nationwide, effective, centralized investigation of such matters.

Nevertheless, the letter of February 7, 1939, Was virtually ignored

by other agencies, and a cumbersome commitlee system, under the direction of

the Undersceretary of State, was inaugurated. The committee was composed of

representatives of the War, Navy, Treasury, Post Office, and Justice Hopartments,

in addition to the State Department, whose function it was to recrive information of

a subversive nature, make an analysis, ad then forward the matler to the agency

deemed most suited to handle the investipation. The bulk of the matters were

referred lo the Pal and the military and naval intelligence services.

The

previous arrangement, based on the President's desires of 1936, was completely

ignored, causing a waste of prior efforts and accumulated information, delays

in referral of cases, und general confusion.

The Department and Bureau prepared a memorandum dated

June 5, 1930, containing ideas and recommondations in he presented to the

President in an effort lo resolve the controversy.

order on the pari of the President would harrily be

needed in order to accomplish this result. All that

would be required from him would be a letter to each

"If the above outlined plan is viewed with favor, it

will mean that all intelligence work within the armed

The overall probiem was not, however, totally resolved with the

Directive of June 26, 1939. Reports were frequently received in linshington

indicting that various local police authorities were forming "sabotage squads".

and the like and, therefore, further clarification was deemed necessary.

The Department and FBI again went to the President to resolve the

question. By memorandum in the Attorney General dated September G, 1939,

former Director Hoover stated:

Mir. F. A. Tamm, Assistant Direclor, and adrised him as is reflecled in Mr. Tamm's

"The Attorney General called and stated that the

very plad to hear this. Mr. surphy staleri he

prepared this on the basis of the nemorandum. t

which the Director forwarded io him."

The Presidential Directives of June 26 and September 6, 1939, were

apparently not issued for the sole purpose of fully describing the scope of

FRI domestic and foreign security intelligence investigative jurisdiction, but

rather were issued to place and finalize investientive authority in the Fill end

the military intelligence services over those areas of jurisdiction where conflicts

were developing. It should he noted, however, the subject malter of the

President's instructions regarding domestic security intelligence investientions

of 1930, as reaffirined in 1938, is also addressed in the Directive of Seplember 6,

1939, thus tending to confirm the President's intent that the Fill and military

scrvices. handle all matters relating to foreign and domestic security intolligence

investigations. In coordinate their efforts, the Fill and the military intel-

ligence services formed the Interdepartmental Intelligence Confrence (IIC.) .

Regular mectings vrre held to discuss and resolve administrative problems,

disseminate information, and formulate plans both on headquarters and

operational levels.

The manner in which the FMI and the military intelligence services

delineated their respective responsibilities is reflecied in a series of Dolimitation

Agicements of June 5. 10.0, February 9, 1942, and February 23, 1919. Fach

of these relimitations Aprecments penerally cites in the preamble that in

conformily with the Presidential Directive of June 26, 1939, as augmented by

the Direclive of September 6, 1939, investigntion of all "espionage, counter-

espionage, sabotage, and subversive activities (or subversion) will be delimiled"!

as therein described.

• T'he Delimitations Agreements of 1910, 1942, and 1949, stale

that the FBl shall investigate those mallers involving citizens and foreign

nationals or foreign-direcied activily in certain geographic arcas, including

the United Stales, and, among other duties, shall advise the military of "cases

of actual or strongly presumptive espionage or sabolage, including the names

of individunts definitely known to be connected with subversive activities"

(1910 and 1912) 01 "developmants concerning the strength, composition, and

intentions of civilian groups within its comizance which air classed as

subversive and whose activities are a potential danger to the security of the

United States" (i949) distr

The IC as in independent committer ceased lo exist., as

pursuant lo the National Security Act of 1919, which formed the National

Security Council (NSC), it was absorbed and chartered by the ase, presiced

ed in partresident helle charter issued by. Asc dated July. 16.2949.

"Pursuant to the provisions of Section 101 of the

National Sccurity Act and NSC 17/ as approved by

the President, the National Security Council hereby.

authorizes and direcis that the interdepartmental

Intelligence Conference effect the coordination of all

investigation oi domestic espionage, counterespionage,

sabotage, subversion, and other related intelligence

maller's affecting internal securily.

"(1) The Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference

shall be constituted as set forth in the Presidential

Dircotive of June 26, 1939, that is, the Direcior

of the lodernl Bureau of Investiration, the Mirccior

of the Intelligence Division of the Army, the hircclor

of Naval Intelligence, and in addition, the Director,

Öffice of Special Investigations, U.S. Air Force,

which office has been created since the issuance of

the origing Presidential Directive.

"I). Nothing herein shall be construed as modifying

or affecting the Presidentiul Directives issued to the

members of the lIC relating to their individunl responsi-

among the members of the HIC relating lo the investi-

• Entive responsibilities and duties of the individual

menbers and other agrecents among these members

relating to the same matters shall remain in full force

and effeci and shall continue to be amended, changed,

and supplemented at the discretion of the !lC."

Thus, it was reaffirmed on Presidential authority through the

charter of the HIC that the Presiciential Directives of June 26, 1939, as mentioned

in the charter and the Delimitations Agreement, and the Directive of September 6,

1039, as contained in the Delimitations Agreement, were not lo he'modified or

affraled and, through the agrecment, were lo remain in full force and effect.

The Presidential intent has also been manifested and reaffirmed

through the issuanor of subseguent Directives by President Rcosevelt on

January 8, 1943, President Truman on July 24, 1950, and President Fisenhower

on December 15, 1953. Such reissuances appear to occur lo reinforce and

remind interested parties of this intent during times of national peril--1943,

during the heicht of Wl' ll; 1950, during the Korenn conflict: and 1953,

during the Cold War cra and cnactment of the Atomic Inergy Art.

On June 9, 1962, President John F. Kennedy executed National

Security Action Memorandum 161, wherein he stated in part:

"2. Accordingly, I have direcled that the two

interdepartmental commitlers concerned with internal

security--the Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference

(UC) and the Interdepartmental Committee on Internal

Security (ICIS) --which have been under the supervision

of the National Security Council, will be transferred

to the supervision of the Aloney General, The

continuing need for these committees and their

relationship lo the Attorney General will be matters

for the Attorney General lo determine."

On March 5, 1904, a time in conjunction with the expiration of

the HIC charter issued by the NSC, the Atorney General directed a charter lo

the MIC which is identichl lo the charter issued by the NSC in 1949, save for

the issuing nuthorily being the Autorney General in place of the NSC. Since that

• time, the Fl! has operaled in the field of foreign counterintchligence and domestic

security, iNstigations under the overall supervision of the Altorney General.

In addition to the lenffirmation of the Presidential intent, the

Attorney Concral has codified his instructions that the FBl handle such

mallers in 28 CFR, Section 0.85(d):

"Carry out the Presidentini directive of

September 6, 1939, as reaffirined by Presidentinl

dircetives of ranunry 8, 1913, July 24, 1950, and

December 15, 1953, designating the (FBI) to take

charge of investigative work in matters relating lo

espionage, sabolage, subversive activities, and

r'claled matiers."

The FBI, in addition, is responsible foi the investigation of

: numerous l'ederal statutory violations, many inherently addressing the field

• of domesic subversion and extremist activities, as well as for retaining

material and conducting such investigations as aru necessary and proper

under the Foderal Imployce Loyalty Program.

As has been illustrated, the FBI, since World War 1, has been

the recognized Feieral agency to conduct investigations of a national security

nature, and, since 1936, has been authorized lo engage in domestic securily

intolligance investigatione through a series of Presidential Directives, as

scaffirmed. Executive Branch charters, and through the parallel interest

generaled in the duty to investigate statutory violations in the ficld.

APPENDIX

STUDENTS FOR A DEIICCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the Students for a

Democratic Societv (SDS), as presently regarded, came into

• being at a founding convention held June, 1962, at Port Huron,

Michigan.

From an initial posture of "participatory' democracy"

the line of the national leadership has revealed a growing

Marxist-Leninist adherence which currentlv calls for the

building of a revolutionary vouth novement.

Concurrently,

the program of SDS has evolved from civil rights struggles to

an anti-Vietnam war stance to an advocacv of a militant anti-

imperialist position. China, Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as the

leaders of worldwide struggles agäinst United States imperialism

whereas the Soviet Union is held to be revisionist and also

imperialist.

At the June, 1969, SDS National Convention, Progressive

Labor Party (PLP) forces in

the organization were expelled..

As a result, the lational Orface (No) group maintained its

National Headnuarters at 1608 West Madison Street, Chicago,

the PLP faction set up headnuarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

This headquarters subsenuentlv moved to Boston.

elected its own

secretaries and a National Interim Committee of eight.

the NO forces and the PLP forces claim to be the true

groups also print their versions of "New Left Notes" which sets

forth the line and the program of the particular faction.

NO version of "New Left Notes" was recently printed under the

title "The. Fire Next Time" to achieve a broader mass appeal.

Two major factions have develoned internally within

the NO groUp, namely,

the weatherman or Revolutionary Youth

Movement (RYM) I faction, and the RYM II faction.

Weatherman

is' action-oriented upholding Castro's position that the duty

of revolutionaries is to make revolution.

Weatherman is re-

garded by RYM! Il'as an adventuristic, elitist faction which

denies the historical role of the working class as the base for

revolution.

RYM II maintains that revolution, although desired,

is not possible under present conditions, hence emphasizes

organizing and raising the political consciousness of the work-

ing class upon whom tliev feel successful revolution depends.

Although disclaining

control and domination by the Communist

Party, USA, leaders in these two factions have in the past pro-

,claimed themselves to be communists and to follow the precents

•of a Marxist-Leninist philosophy, along pro-Chinese communist

lines.

APPENDIX

A second source has advised that the PLP faction

which is more commonlv known as the Worker Student Alliance

is dominated and controlled by members of the PLP, who are

required to identifv themselve, with the pro-Chinese Marxist-

Leninist philosophy of the PLP.

They advocate that an alliance

between

workers and

students is vital to the bringing about

of. a revolution

in

the United States:

SDS regions and university and college chapters,

although operating under the outlines of the SDS National

Constitution, are autononous in

nature and free to carry out

independent nolicy reflective of local conditions, Because

of this autonomy internal struggles reflecting the major

factional interests of SDS have

occurred at the chapter level

since the beginning of the 1959-70 school year.

ADMINISTRATIVE MATTER

SYNOPSIS

In June, 19G1, a new special Desk was created in the Interna

Security Section,

Domestic Intelligence Division; as a result of my

memorandum to you 5/20/61, to concentrate on the investagation into

the comnunist influence in racial matters.

This investigation was to

be handled by two supervisors, one being separated from the Communist

Party Unit and one from the Comuunist Front Unit.

To assimilate the

other work beinf loft by those supcrvisors, it was necessary to obtain

an additional Supervisor. This matter was looked into by the Inspecti

Division which rccomnendeduand it was approved, that an additional

supervisor,

Special Agent L

_is acciened on a temporary

basis, with the thought that as soon as we could saicly do so, the two.

Supervisors would be sent back to their respoctive Units., The neces-

sity for our intensification of the investigation of communist influen•

In racial natteis has not abated, but has incicased.

There is no-sign

of a.lctup.

The Communist Front

Unit, there the temporary Supervisor

•assigned,

has also shown an incrense in its case load.

The "temporary

nature of the situation 1s now belicved to be "pernanent."

The necessity for the temporary supervisor whom we obtained

in early Junc,

1961, is more than ever present.. Our work load in the

communist influence in racial matters which senerated the necessity

for a temporary Supervisor has boch steadily increasing, with no sign

of a letup; the work in the Communist front Unit where

the temporary

Supervisor has heen assigned has also increased.

RECOLENDATION:

That the one Spilahid Agent,

Due 11/1/01 are comprehensive investigativo reports

from all 11cld offices which will provido centralized reporting on this

mattci.

The Communist front Unit, which is where the temporary super-

visor is assirned,

has also shown an increase in its case load. As of

10/1/01 the Communist Front Unit had 392 ponding investigations as com-

pared to 375 ponding investigations as of 7/1/61. The rocont Supreme

court decisións farvianie iu int Faily undér virious facots of tho

Internal Socurity Act ol 2950 have breathed new life into the Party.

The Party is now taking bolder stops to carry on its work 'in

organizations, as well as cicating now front orfanizations. One casc

In point is that denling with the l. E. B. Dubois Clubs of

Anerica,

Inc., the new national Inity youth organization.

The formation of

this youth group was finalized at a National Convention in June, 1961,

1 which was held in San Francisco, California, and was attended by

approximately 150 youths.

Since that time soveral affiliatos of this

group have comc into existence.

One of the plans for action decided

upon by the group was to have affiliates of the group formed on college

campuses throughout the united States; therciorc, it can be expected

that in the immedinte future after these various youths have returned

to their college campuses, they will form such campus froups.

M1ll represent not only an incrcase in case load,

incrense the worl: of the field in penetrating and folloring the

activities of such kroups.

This will call for close supcivision of

these groups due to the nature of the make-up of the

fact that they are located on college campuses in order to avoid any

embarrassment to the Bureau.

It is also anticipated that with the

advent of the fall and winter seasons, the larty will step up its

activitics in attempting to penctrate

legitimate miss orranizations

and in establishing now fiont groups to carry on the Party's work on

Issues in which

that the parents of one of these individuals woul appear at a rally during the

DNC.

On 8/25/64 Assistant Dircctor Cartha DeLoach elephoned a memorandum

..to Mr. Moir from Atlantic City to the effect information from Walter Jenkins

and informants indicated the question of seating the MFDP delegates was expected

to reach the floor of the DNC the evening of 8/25/64. He said "The crucial point.

of the convention in so far as possible violence is concerned will occur helween

4:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. this afternoon. If the Mississippi Freedom Democratic

Party is not seated then the unruly elements within the Negro group will possibly

attempt to demonstrate." DeLoach indicated that every effort was being extended

to cover developments pertinent to this possible violent siluation.

There follows under appropriate capiion in summary form information

• relative to our coverage at the DNC.

COVERAGE RELATIVE TO POTENTIAL CIVIL UNREST,

DENONSTRATIONS AND P'OSSIBLE VIOLENCE

A review of the summaries furnished.to Walter Jenkins by Mi. DeLoach

during the DNC indicates over 25 separate entries dealing with demonstrations

insofar as their times, places, groups involved, number of participants, and

general nature thereof were concerned. A great majority of the Bureau person-

nel still on active duly who were assigned to this special squad in Atlantic City

have indicated that the altaining of intelligence information relative to possible

violent civil disorders was the primary purpose of their efforts during the DNC.

mise Our" coverage in mis regard was hanhed trough extensive informant

coverage at Atlantic Cily and as a,result of information roceived from informants

in other parts of the country as well. Additionally, we utilized Agents in various

undercover capacities to develop such informiion.

Furthermore, a great deal

of information in this regard was, in fact, recched as a resull of the technical

coverage tilized. Where appropriale, the information obtained was disseminated

" to the U. S. Secret Service, and other interester law, enforecment agencies as

assignment in part was related to the augmenting of the U.S. Secret.Service in- •

sofar as the prolection of the President was concerned. One Agent indicated

that Bureau personnel did, in fact, actively assist in the protection of the

" Precident and his fumily while they were at the DNC.

A review of Bureau file? 100-412527/captioned "Disruption of Democratic

National Convention, Information Concerning (Internal Securily)" did not reveal

any information directly relating to the prolaction of the President.

A review of the DeLoach summaries to Mr. Jenkins indicaled one

instance where a demonstration was planned to take place upon the President's

arrival at convention hall and another incident which revealed a breach of

security which allowed an individual to enter the convention hall and proceed

directly to the podium area. This information was furnished immediately to

the U. S. Secret Service.

Information is contained in the interviews of the former special squad

personnel that FBI Agents were utilized in supplementing U. S. Secret Service

personnel on the convention hall floor.

IN FORMATION DEVELOPED OF POSSIBLE POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE

A further review of the DeLoach summaries revealed approximately

20 sparate items which do not appear to relate directly with possible civil

unrest - demonstrations or with the prolection of the President. These items

were developed as a result of the various types of coverage we had at the DNC

but a great number thereof were obtained through our technical coverage. A

sampling of these items includes the following:

-juanger.

•2. Informant information received that Congressman Adam Clayton

Powell was carrying i revolver.

3.

Informant information relative to Nalional Association for the

Advancement of Colored People planning i meeting at a church.

The only information located in Bureau files concerning

the special squad in Atlantic City was an eight-page memorandum (copy attached)

with enclosure located in the file of DeLoach. This is a memorandum from

DeLoach to Mohr dated 8/29/64 which sets forth that in connection with the

assignment of the special squad in Atlantic City at the direction of the President,

Deboach wished to report the successful completion of this assignment. He

Istates that by means of informant coverage, use of various confidential tech-

niques, intiltration of key groups through use of undercover agents and through

utilization of Agents using appropriate cover as reporters. We were able lo

Jeep the White House fully apprised of all major developments. De Loach also

advised that immediate liaison was established in Atlantic City with Secret

/Service as well as state and local police.

This memorandum refers to highly confidential coverage of Martin Luther

King and Bayard Kustin, along with similar coverage established on the lead-

quarters of the Congress of R.cial Equality (CORE) - Student Nonviolent

Jenkins at the White House and to his memorandum he attached a copy of these

daily summaries dated 8/24, 25, 26, 27/61. These summaries are in effect.

that the t'bt alford speciti coverage at the convention. It should be noted that

at this time DeLoach was responsible for liaison with the White House and iad

a direct line at his residence to the President so it weil may be that this request

was made directly to DeLoach who in turn discussed it orally with Mr. Hoover

aust me: On 1/20/75 the Inspection Division directed a telelype incorporating

12 questions to the 19 Agents and one radio maintenance technician who are

still on active duty and were with DeLoach at Ailantic Cily. These questions

were designed to have the participating personnel furnish us with their recol-

lection as to their duties and involvement at Atlantic City. Detailed responses

were promptly received and all personnel acknowledged their participation on

the specil squad under DeLoach's leadership at the convention. All responded

there was no question in their mind at the time but that they were in Atlantic

captioned "Fiscal Year 1971 Budget Policy Guidance, "referred

to the fact that ie have been conducting a seven-month's analysis

of the Bureau's Administrative Index (ADEX) and that it appears

that by implenenting certain streamlining measures and

altcring

requirements for reporting and periodic verification of informa-

tion, sone manpower might be available for reassignnent to onc

of the other critical arcas of our work. In this connection the

memorandum pointed out that the Domestic Intelligence Division

has an urgent need for in excess of 500 Spocial Agents to handle

several arcas of national security work which are not receivir;

attention descrved.

BACKGROUND

By way of background, the doEx. is an

outgrowth of the old

security Index program which in itself vas

an integral part of

the Emergency Detention Program.

The Emergency Detention Program

in latter years derived its

authority from Title II of the Internal

Socurity Act of 1950 (better known. as

the Emergency Detention Met).

Fall of 1971 the Emergency Detention Act was repealed b!

Congress and we, of course, immediately discontinued the Emergency

Detention Program.

since the Security Index was in actuality it

an extension of an intogral part of the Energency Detention

Progran, it was believed that the security Index as..it was

structured should also be discontinued 10 Kie:..-

an administrative standpoint, however, it las

believed

that the Bureau

should be able to imnediately identity

individuals who constitute

threat to the national socurity,

particularly during time of national emergency:

The Security

Index chabled us to rotriove information pinpointing such

individuals. Representatives of the Department, during a meting

folloving repeal of the Emergency Dotention Act, pointed out that

, even though congross has now prohibited a program for emergency

prehension and detention, circumstances might someday be suci

Re: Administrative Index

Streamlining Mcasurcs

-that the Government might have to defond itself from attack and

that it would be necessary at such time to quickly identify

persons lho vero a

threat to the national security so tht

investigation could be

intensificd and if necessary the President

could go to a joint session of Congress

and ask for encrgency

lcgislation

permitting apprehension and detention of persons

who threaten existence of the Government.

The Department advised after consultation that the FBi's

authority to investigate individuals engaged in subversive

activity had not been croded by repeal of the imergency Detention

Act, ald that further iepeal of this Act did not in

any way

prohibit the FBI fron maintaining an administrative

inder of

individuals who were undor investigation for subversive activity.

Accordingly, we devised the Administrative Index for the purpose

of being able to quickly identify persons representing a threat

to the national security.

since we alrcady had the identities.

of such persons contained in the security Inder, le used the

security Index as a basis

for setting up the Administrative Index.

The major difference: of course, was

that whorcas persons listed

in Sccurity Index had been listed with a vich of possible

apprehension

and detention, the persons being listed in neX

"would not be subject to

detention, but would be listed for ready

identification purposes.

Since persons listed in ADEX would not be subject to

apprchension and detention, the requirement for Departmental

concurrence in listing no longer existed.

Also, since the

detention factor was no longer a major

issue, persons could

listed irrespective of degree

ithe national securaty.

Criteria for listing in ADEX were broken down into four

categories.

Each category, beginning with Category I, contained

a listing

of persons

and Category I listed those considered

dangerous

to the national security,

thile Category IV listed

those

least dangerous.

As of July 15, 1972, there were 15,259

individuals listed

in ADEX.

Of this total 1,354 were Category I;

Re:

ASSESSMENT OF ADEX

ADEX has now been in operation about: 8 months and we

have had a chance

to evaluate its operation and offoctiveness.

Based

on

discussions

with

field

personnel as well as our olin

observations, no boliove that several major changes should be

made at this

time.

(1) While ADEX has not been intended as an invostigative m

program, it is somcwhat of an extension of security Index which

was

an integral

part of an investigative program,

and there are

vestiges of the investigative program apparent in our operation

Of ADEX. ADEX must bo clearly scparated from invostigativo

criteria and policy so that'it reprosents a mere by-product or

administrative supplement to our invostigations and not as a

The dance controlling factor in the investigation descle

nature of the criteria for inclusion

of individuals in

ADEX are such to goncrate invostigative activity which may not

be necessary were it not foi adex.

Reporting procedures for a

• gIcat bull of our security cases are based on the category of

Abex or the fact that the subject is lisied in AdEx.

A great

deal of invostigative activity is created because of the requirement

of poriodic vorification of residence and employment addresses..

In other words,

existence of ADEX creates investigative and

• ÷i

reporting activity which might not be necessary otherwise.

(2)

It is believed that ADEX is needlessly complex,

• particularly from the standpoint of criteria for inclusion

of an individual in the ADEX, and is administratively cumbersome.

(3) Most important, it is believed that in light of the

conditions existing today, particularly with respect to emphasis

on invasion of privacy and other First and Fourth Amendment

rights,

the current criteria

for designating individuals for ADEX

arc too broad

and all-encompassing.

As a result, there are some

individuals now included in ADEX even though they do not realis-

tically pose a threat to the national security.

For campie,

present ADEX guidelines cover individuals who arc not members

of

subversive or rcvolutionary groups but who have "exhibited a

revolutionary idcology" and are litoly to seize upon the oppor-

tunity presented by a national emergency to commit acts of

espionage, " etc.

. Re:

Administrative

Index

Streamlining Measures

beloved that such broad terminology would leave us in a vulner-

able position if our guidelines

were to be scrutinized by

interested Congressional committees, which has boon threatened.

PROPOSED NEW ADEX CRITERIA

If for no other roason but practicality, it. is believed

•that ADEx should be a list of individuals who realistically represait

an immediate threat to the national scucrity, as opposed to

individuals who might theorctically pose a threat in the future

under

a givon set of circumstances.

We-recognize that anyone

who has embraced a philosophy that includes an overthrow of the

American

form of government is a potential enemy of the Government.

However, in many such

instances, an individual may believe in some

other form of government but would be unwilling to engage in

170F.

activity more violent than philosophical discussions.

On the other side. of the coin is an individual sho nui

only embraces the philosophy of overthrow of the Government, but is

actually engaged in some form of activity designed to bring

about

that ovoithrow by force of violence or other unconstitutional means.

It is this latter individual who would seize upon any type of

national emergency to exploit a weakness in Governmental

functions

in an effort

to wrest control, or who would commit violent acts

such as bombings of public buildings which are symbolic of our

national institutions; ambush killings of police officers tho

arc the visiblo symbol of our democratic system; attack vater

supplies, power systems,

or transportation facilities in an

effort to croate a chaotic void into which a revolutionary force

might he able to supplant the Government.

This is the type of

individual who should be listed in the AdEX.

....

categorics

It is therefore proposed that the existing ADEX with four

representing an unrealistic concept of individuals

constituting a threat to the national security be revised so that

it will include only; one category.

This would

be a list of

individuals who represent an actual danger nor to the national

socurity.

It is belioved that such a list would embrace mosi of

the individuals currently listed in Categories I and Il of ADEX,

or a

total

as of 7/15/72 of 4,780 individuals..

Re:

Administrativc.Index

• Streamlining Measures

To do this the criteria would be changed to read as

follows:

isti

"ADEX should be limited to those individuals whose

actions or statements have

clearly established that they represent

a current threat to the national security.

"Included are individuals, whether affiliated with organ-

ized groups of not, who have snown a willingness and capability

for engaging in trcason, reboilion or insurrection, seditious

conspiracy, sabotage, espionage, terrorism, gucrrilla varfare,

assassination of Government officials of loaders,

or other such

acts which would result in interference

with or a

threat to the

survival and eftective operation of national, state, or local

government.

"The foregoing would include leaders of organization.

whose aims include the overthrow or destruction of the United States

or the government of any State, Territory, district, or possession

thercof,

or the government of any political subdivision therein,

by unlawful means.

Individuals affiliated with

such organizations

ho have demonstrated a willingness and capability of activity

set forth under critoria set forth above would be included, but

• mere membership in such organization is not sufficient to justify

inclusion in ADEX.

"Individuals should be considered

a 'current threat? to:

the national security when reliable information has been

developed that they have engaged in activity falling within

•the above-described

criteria

during the past two years and

there is no indication that they have given up of ceased to

engage in such activity."

Adoption of these new critoria will probably rosult

in deletion

from ADEX of numerous individuals who are connected

with subversive organizations.

For example, there were 4501

Communists in Categories

III and IV Of ADEX

as of 7/15/72.

Additionally there :are members of Socialist Workers Party,

Progressive Labor Party,

otc. who will not meet the revised

criteria of being dangerous now.

'It is believed that the

•Burcau should maintain a list of such individuals aside from

ADEX in the event we had to quickly identify known

subversives

throughout the country.

We will therefore submit a separite

proposal to establish a "Communist Index" which vill require a

Elmodicum of effort on the part of the field and Bureau déadquarters.

Such

a list would

also be advantagcous in quickly

identifying extremists, who though not posing a threat to the

national

socurity, do sock to dony constitutional rights of

others, or are white or black chauvinists

or nationalists tho

thrive

on race hatreds and

ethnic discord.

We will also

propose that a counterpart to the "Communist Index" be established

to be known as the "Extremist Indox."

Neither of these indexes

will constitute a program but will merely be a listing which will

be computeriied

for ready retrioval at any time ve nued to quickly

identify persons of this type who were involved in

activity inimical

to the national interest.

Details concerning these indexes will

be included in the separate proposal.

MANPOWER SAVINGS

It is difficult if not impossiblo to estimate a manpover

savings as result of redefining ADEX and streamlining its operation.

However, based on the premise that the revised adex would contain

primarily what is now Categories I & II, this would mean that about

10,473 individuals would be

dropped.

these remained on AdeX,

this many cases would be opened during a treive-month period due

-to necessity to verify employment and residence addresses

and to

report any pertinent data developed to date.

These

cases would be

in a closed status in the field and would be reopened on a

rogular staggered basis.

1 canvass of ten field offices including New York,

Newark, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, San Francisco. o.

"Los Angeles,

Chicago and Philadelphia resulted in an

roughly 89% of the

ibove-described total of 10,473 cases

would .be affected.

These offices could not give any realistic

estimato of manpowcr involved. However, using purcly a cascioad

average of 40 cases

as a guide; using the 89% estinate

of the offices canvassed; there would be 9,311 cases opened over

a 12-month period of about: 776 cases por month.

When revision of

ADEX has been approved and

the new critoria have been

furnished

to the fiold, Domestic Intelligence Division will canvass cach

Special Agont in Charge to deternine specifically, on the basis

of the revised critoria, the manpower savings which can be

dirocted to higher priority security work.

The Inspection

Division, of course, will be in the best position

to evaluate

the impact of the revisions in their field audits of alex.

Re :

¡Streamlining Mcasures

It is important to note that there will

be no innediate

manpower savings icalized since it is anticipated

that necessary

review of ADEX

cases will not be completed for at least 12 months.

To avoid creating a

sudden

increase in workload in the field,

instructions are boing issued to review existing ADEX cases as the

would normally come up on tickler during the next 12 months under

the old ADEX rules.

In this manner all cases now listed in ADEX

can be reviered without creating

an undue buiden on the field.

We will know on a month-to-month basis at leadquarters from

computer print-outs as to progress being made.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) Attached for approval are detailed instructions

in mcmorandum for all Special Agents in Charge.

Revisions will

be made in Manual of Instructions and submitted separately.:

• (2) If proposed rovision is approved, investigative

The dangerousness of a member or affiliate of a subversive

organizition does not nucessarily depend entirely upon his

personal characteristios,

such as addressiveness or a dis-

position to violence.

determination.

(F) SECURITY INDEX -- In connection with all sccurity investigations

in the case of individual subjects: the essential question for determination

is whether the subject's activities are such as lo depict him 1o be a

potential danger to the national security oi the Unucd Stales in lime

of an emergency. In the erent such a determination is made, his name

should be included in the Security Index.

The Security Index criteria have been found to afford

practical and vorkable guidelines in arriring at a conclusion as lo •

whelher a subjectrepresents a potential danger and are suificiently

• clastic so that when applied with the necessary judgment, the complex

questions which may arise in connection with those cases can be

resolved.

,C) SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS - The emergence

of the new left movement as a subversive force dedicated to the compiete

destruction of the traditional values of our democratic society presents

the Bureau with an unprecedented challenge in the security fie!d.

Although the new leit has no definable ideology oi ils own, it does

have strong Marsist, cristentialist, nihilist and anarchist orestones.

While mere membership in a new lef group is not suiticient to establish

that an individual is a pocential threat lo the internal sceurity of the

-United States, it must he recognized that many indiviäuals affilialed

with the new ieit movement do, in fact, engage in violence or unlal

activities, ani their potential dangerousness is cicariy demonstraled

by their statements, conduct and actions.

The Bureau has recently, noted that in many instinces

security investigations of these individuals are not being initialed.

In some cases: subjects are not being recommended ior inclusion on

the security Index merely because no membership in a basic revolutionary

organization could be established. Since the new left is basically

anarchist, many of the leading activists in it are not members oi any

basic revolutionary group. It should be borne in mind that even if a

subject's membership in a subversive organization cannot be proven,

his inclusion on the Security Index may often be justified because of

activities which establish his anarchistic tendencies.

In this regard,

you should constantly vear in mind that the public sitements. tie

writings and the loadership activilies oi subjecis of securitr investi-

• gations which establish them as anarchisis are proper areas oi

inquiry. Such activity should be actively pursued through investigation

with the ultimate view of including them on the Securily index. It is

entirely possible. therefore, that a subject without any organizational

affiliation can quality for the Security Index by virte of his public pronounce-

ments and activities which establish his rejection of law and order and

• reveal him to be a potential threat to the security of the Uniled States.

It is equally important to understand that mere dissent and

opposition to Governmental policies pursued in a legal constitutional

manner are not suiticient to

warrant inclusion in the Security Inder.

You

are reminded that one of the four criteria in Section STD, Manual of

Instructions, must-apply. Further, in those cases requiring Burcau

suthority to initiale investigations, your requests must summarize

show anti-Victnam or peace group sentiments without also revealing

(C) INVESTIGATION OF UNAFFILIATED WINTE RACIAI, EXTREMISTS -

RACIAL MATTERS -- Under existing instructions, investigation of white

extremists is restricted to those individuals who are associated with the

Klan or other wnite hat - type organizations. In view of the recent marked

increase in violent acts throughout the United States on the part of indi-

viduals who are not affiliated with the ilan or other white hate-lype

organizations, it is necessary to modily existing instructions to broaden

the scope of our investigative responsibilities to include these unaffiliated

individuals.

Investigation has established that many of the inclividuals

involved in these iccent acts of violence, aithough not currenily members

of the Klan or otner white hate-type groups, did have precious aifiliation

with such groups and still maintain their extremist

tendencies.

Hereafter, investigation must be promptly instituteci on these

unaffiliated white racial extremists and their activities closely followed.

In conducting these investigations; you should be guided by instrúc-

tions set out in Section 1224, Volume IV: Manual oi instructions: which

apply to investisations oi the Klan and white hale-lype orcanizations anci

associalcd indiviciuals. Appropriate manual and handbook revisions wiil

be forthcoming.

(B) WHITE MILITANT GROUPS - RACIAL MATTERS

(ORGANIZATION) - In view of incrousing militancy in tie racial

field, neighborhood groups whose members are of the while, race,

have been sprinuing up throughout the United States. Somd of these

groups appear to be militant in nature and some urge the white man to

arm himseli as i means of protection against racial violence. Some of

= these groups are known lo sponsor demonstrations auainst iricaration

and against the bussins of ivegro students lo while schools. Oiners

appoar lo advocate more violent methods of opposition to integration.

The appearance of these groups is noted mostiy in the white theiro

arcas of the large cities which border on minority group living areas.

In order to fulfill our responsibilities in the racial

intelligence field we must be cognizant of the groups and leir aims

and purposes. Upon receipt of information as lo the formation or

existence of such a group: i preliminary investigation snould be

immediately initiated io determine the aims and purposes of the organ-

ization, its leaders, approximate memiurship. as well as any pertinent

background dal which will assist in determining the militancy of the

grOUp.

From information presently available, it appears that

many of these organizations have veen founded on principies of lear

rather than hate and as such, they cannot ie classited as hate grouns.

Your investigations should, thereiore, be discreet and most circumspect.

You should limit your inquiries to a review of Bureau files, contacts with

Burenu informants, and established sources, and the use oi public

source information.

of while ghollo areas to the recent wave of rcial disorders resulting

from the assassination of Martin Luther King. Jr. You should remain

alert to this possibility. Informant coverage of lne Klan. white hate

(F) COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF THE CONGRESS OF MACIAL

of Floyd Mckissick has steadily moved away from a legitimate civil

condoning acis of violence as a means of attainine Negro rights. It is

moving toward the exclusion of members of tie white race from its

the above, this orcanization should be investigated in the future under

the Racial Mallers character rather than under the Communist

(B) REPORTING OF PROTEST DEMONSTILATIONS - The BICaU

has noled a trond loward incomploie and nonspecific reporting of

disruptive, anti-Government demonstrations and prolest mllies. It.

is often nccessary lo go back to the reporting office for pertinent

details concerning these disorders, which resulls in delayed

--

dissemination. Details which have been neglected include inilure to

report number of prolesters present, identities of organizations,

and identities of speaker's and leading actirisis.

The necessity for full and complole reporting must be

impressed on all personnel handling those mallers.

Existing

instructions require that communications reperting such incidents

are to be submilled under a substantive case caption wilh a brief,

accurate description of the event: for crample. Students for a

Democratic Socioly - Demonstration Against ROTC. University of

Wisconsin, 4/25/72. Where multiple organizations are involved.

the group primarily responsible for organizing the demonstration

should be utilized in the caption.

When your original communication concerning a disruptive

demonstration does not contzin all pertinent details. you should set

forth what stops you are laking lo obtain this information.

Make

cerlain that you suomit recommendations for imtinuing investigation

of sponsoring orcanizations, ií warranied, undei criteria set 1orth

in Section 8713, Alanual oi Instructions.

For proper rouling of

information at the Bureau continue lo use code words "VIDE!"

(Vietnam Demonstration) and "STAG" (Student Agilation). Persons

arrested should be identified, since circumstances of an arrest, in

some cases, maj indicate a propersily for violence.

In considering

whether a security investigation of an individual is warranted, it

should be noted that a mere arrest in connection with a demonstration

is insufficient basis in jiself for investigation. The arrest must be

coupled with a demonstraied propensity for violence or with

subversive or revolutionary activity on the part of the individual

The above guidelines are intended lo reilerale and clarity

existing instructions ind you must insure that in reporting these

matters you adhere lo Bureau rcuiremenls.

(I1) INVESTIGATION OF THE NEW LEFT -- There has been a marled

increase in recent months of bombings and burnines of public buildings

and other acts of ierror.sm which could logically have been perccirated

by extremist elements of the New Leit. New Left loaders have constancy

exhorted their followers to abandon their traditional role of "passive -..

dissent" and resort to acts of violence and terrorism as a means ot

disrupting the diciense ciort and opposing esublished autiority. Publi-

cations of the New Leit are replete with articles proposing te bombings

of draft boards and other Government installations, anci literature con-

taining detailed diagrams and instructions lor making incentiary devices

nas been widely disseminated among New Leit groups.

Thave been appalled by the reaction of some of our field offices

to some of the acts of violeice and terrorism which have occurred, such

as those which have recently taken piace in certain coliege towns and in

some instances on college campuses. While it is recognized that many

of these acts do not constitute violations of law within the primary

investigative jurisdiction of the Burcau, it is essential, Where te strong

presumption crisis ihat acts of violence have been perpetrated by New

Leftists or other subsersive elements under investiation by the Bureau.

that every logical ciiort should ve maic lo resolve througn contact wiih

established sources whether these elements are in fact responsible lor

such acts. Of course. good judgment and extreme caution must ve

utilized in this connection so as not to convey the impression to the

public or other investigave agencies that we are assuming jurisdiction

in those instances where there are not laels which would establish FBI

jurisdiction.

It cannot be too strongly emphasized that posilive resulls can

be achieyed only through the development of adequate high quality iniormants

who are in a position io obtain detailed information regarding the activities

and future plans of individuals and organizations alfiliated with the New

Left movement. i'

When torroristic acts occur which by reason of the tiget

of the net or by reason of the locale would appear lo ll into the objeclives

of or could have been molivaied by subversive elements. particularly

in the form of alerting and directing all logical sources and informants

into activity lo determine if subversive groups could have been responsible.

I have remindad you time and again that the militancy of the

Now Left is escalating daily.

Unless you recognize this and movr in a

more positive manner lo icentify subversive elemenis responsible so

that appropriate prosecutive action, whether federally or locally

initiated, can be laken, this type of activity can be expectec lo mount

in intensity and to sprcad lo coliege campuses across the country. This

must not be allowed to happen and I am going to hold each Special Agent

in Charge personaily responsible lo insure that the Bureau's responsi-

bilities in this area are completely met and fulfilled.

(B) SECURITY AND EXTREMIST INFORMANT PAYMENTS - SUB-

MISSION OF JUSTIFICATION LETTERS -- As you are avare, all

security and extremist informants receiving compensation froin the

Bureau are paid on the basis of the value of information furnished

-services renderca, and expenses incurred.

It is the responsibility of each Special Agent in Charge to

insure all espenditures for information are on a strict c.o.d. basis

commensurate with the value of the information furnished. In this

regard, it has recently been noled that some justification lelters do not

contain a complete detailed justification for monies paid to informants.

In the luture, assure that these lellers contain a complete delalled

justificalion in order that FBlll can make a reasonable determination

as to whether or not full value is being received for all monies ex-

pended for payments lo informants.

In submitting your justification, avoid using gencralilies

and in each instance set out, under the summary of normation fur-

nished, spccific details of significant information furnished, includ-

ing examples. In other words, in addition lo setting forth such infor-

mation as the number of meetings allended and/or the number of

individuais reported on, you must set forth specific information being

reported by the informant regarding activities of the organizalion

and /or individual which would warrant the payments recommended.

This matter will continue lo receive careful allention at

FBIHQ and you will be held personally accountable to insure that all

payments are fully justified.

These instructions should be called lo

the attention of all Special Agents in your ollice handling informants

and sources.

• (B) INFORMANTS AND SOURCES - PAYMENTS - As you are alrie

Informanto and sources receiving compensation from the Burcau are

reimbursed on the basis of lie value of the information reported,

-services porformed and expenses incurred. An increasing tendency

has been observed in lield submissions to request special paymenls or

justify regular payments for informants or sources seemingly based

on personal needs of the informant as isiinct from the value of infor-

mation furnished and legitimate and related expenses incurred. The

personal needs of an informant, such as repair of a vehicle, illness

or other presaing necessity for funds: do not meet the basic criteria

of information furnished or related expenses. iniormants shouid not

be influcnecd lo believe we will pay for such personal nercis. 'The

basic concent that ihe informant is selling information of value on a

c.o.a. basis, nich as an independent contractor, and is not an

emplojee must be adheres to and understood by contacting Agents and

the informanls.

This does not, however, proclude use of imagination and in-

novation when a source of considerable potential vaiue needs financial

Inducement lo cogase in gathering of information under conditions which

hardship. In such inslances you slould fuily develop lie facts and

This matter will continue to receive carcful attention'at FBIlle

and you will be held accountable to insure that payments are for value

received. These instructions should be called lo the atiention of all

Spocial Agents in your office handling intormants and sources.

(D) SECURITY INFORALANTS AND SOURCES - PAYMENTS -- AS YOU

are aware, all security iniormants and sources receiving compensation

from the Bureau are paid on the basis oi the value of iniormation

furnished, services rendered and incurred expenses. Recently, it has

been noted that some iniormants and sources have veen paid consistently .-

the same amount cach month with no variation in payments during

periods when the iniormants or sources were less productive, which

leads to the illogical implicacion that inormation iurnished or expenses

incurred or both scidom, if ever, vary. This practice must be

discontinued. Your iniormants and sources must understand they are

never be led to believe they are recipients of a fixed salary.

on the other hand,

the FBI should not roport every minor local disturhance where

there is no appaiont interest to the President, the Attorncy

DeLoach called me this morning to say that his, informa-

morning's meeting you were not going to let the group discuss

seating-of the "freedom party" delegation, but would take the

tiative. iKing was, last night, pondering on whether to re-

fuse to come to the meeting on the grounds of short notice.

(Hardly a tenable position in view of the attached telegram of

the day before yesterday).

Another interesting fact is that Rustin called me yesterday to

ask whether he was to attend the meeting. I told him that so

"speak up to the President"'.

SULLIVAN MEMORANDA TO JOHN DEAN

(COVERAGE OF TELEVISION PRESENTATION,

SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE

Reference is made to my letter of January 30, 1975, setting

forth information in the "Sullivan memoranda." Your attention is specifically

invited to the allegation that on February 19, 1966, Marvin Watson called

from the White House advising the President wanted the FBI to cover Senate

Foreign Relations Committee television presentation with a view toward

determining whether Senator Fullbright and the other Senators were receiving

information from Communists.

We are unable to locate a memorandum of the telephone call

referred to; nowever, there is a memoranaum on recora Irom vir. William C.

Sullivan to Mr. Cartha D. De Loach which refers to a memorandum from

Mr. De Loach to Mr. Tolson on February 18, 1966. In this memorandum

of Mr. Sullivan's dated February 26, 1966, he advised that the Senate Foreign

Relations televised presentation of February 18, 1966, was monitored. He

attaches a memorandum drawing parallels between the statements made by

Senators Fullbright and Morse and statements which the Communists have

been making. He points out that we have received no indication that any

members of the Communist Party, USA, or any other subversive groups have

furnished either of the Senators with material which prompted their statements.

Mr. Sullivan recommended that this attachment be delivered to Marvin Watson.

Mr. Hoover stated, "No. I want letter to Watson transmitting it." •

By letter dated February 24. 1966, Marvin Watson vas advised

Er In positio just request is encosed a memor andum Which sets out

the Communist Party line concerning some of the issues raised during the

Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings on U: S. policy on Vietnam."

In this memorandum dated February 24, 1966, which had

originally keen dated February 21, 1966, which was the memorandum

accompanying the above-described Sullivan to De Loach memorandum,

parallels are drawn between the television presentation and documented

Communist Party publications or statements of Communist leaders.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION CONCERNING

DEPARTMENT'S REQUEST FOR BODY RECORDER

IN BOBBY BAKER INVESTIGATION IN 1965

In response to the réquest made by

Deputy Attorney

General Laurence H.. Silberman for a complete report on the

Bobby Baker investigation, in which it was mentioned that the

FBI turned down requests

for a body recorder and also for the

contents of a communication from Mr. Hoover to President Johnson

regarding this matter, the following is submitted.

By memorandum dated 3/25/65, Assistant Attorney General,

(AAG) Criminal Division, requested that the FBI take necessary

steps to place a body recorder on the person of Wayne L. Bromley

to record the conversations of Bromley with Clifford L. Jones and

Bobby Baker.

This would have necessitated placing à recorder on

the person of Bromley prior to the time he left Washington, D. C.,

as he was being met in Los Angeles by Jones upon his arrival.

BIomley, a Washington, D. C., Attorney and close associate of

Baker, was. cooperating with the FBI and had testified before

the Baker Grand Jury.

Jones is a former Lieutenant Governor

of the State of Nevada and is an Attorney as well as a member

• of one of the corporations which

was furnishing cash to Baker

for his assistance.

By letter dated 3/26/65 from the Director to Mr. Herbert

J. Miller, MAG, he was informed the Department's request for

the use of the

body recorder on the person of Bromley was.

inadvisable in view of the fact that the maximum security for

the equipment and Bromley's person could not be accomplished, as

well as adequate security could not be accomplighed at the hotels.

aCt "Coby letter dated 1,22/64 lo the donorable Malvin Watson,

Special Assistant to the President, The White House, the President

was advised of the circumstances regarding the request of 'the

Criminal Division of the Department to place a body recorder on

Bromley and the Bureau's declination to honor this request.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION CONCERNING

DEPARTMENT'S REQUESI FOR BODY RECORDER

IN BOBBY BAKER INVESTIGATION IN 1965

Included in the letter to Mr. Matson was the fact

that Acting Attorney General Clark had

advised

an official of

this Bureau on 12/23/66 that after the FBI's refusal to monitor

the meeting in Los Angeles, the Immigration and Naturalization

Service or the Bureau of Marcotics was contacted, and that he

was certain it was the. Bureau of Narcotics that handled the

monitoring.

No documentation of this conversation located.

A note added on page three of the letter dated

1/12/67 sets forth information that the letter was submitted

to "advise the white House as to circumstances under which

• this Bureau tape recoräed, on 3/25/65, two telephone calls

: (deemed to be legal by Department) involving Baker, but

refused to electronically monitor a meeting in Los Angeles

• on 3/26/65 between Baker and two of his associates. These

calls and the meeting were referred to in a 1/l1/67 news

article in the "Washington Evening Star" and undoubtedly

• will receive much publicity when results are introduced as

evidence in present trial of Baker.'

On 1/17/67 Assistant to the Director Cartha D. DeLoach

was called to the khite House by Marvin Watson and Watson

referred to the Director's memorandum to the President setting •

forth the information that the FBI had refused

a request to

utilize a recording device in the Baker case. . Watson furnished .

information that inasmuch as the Bureau of Narcotics had later

handled this matter for the Department of Justice, the President

had demanded a summary memorandum from the Secretary of Treasury

concerning the matter. Watson also indicated the President was

quite exercised about the fact the FBI had properly refused only

to have the Treasury honor the request of the Department of Justice.

The Crime RecordS Division will handle the

coordination of this matter.

The Liaison section of

the Domestic Intelligence Division (particularly the

liaison agent assigned to Treasury and Narcotics) -

should discreetly ascertain as much information as

possible and furnish such information to Crime Records

so that a complete background memorandum can be prepared.

It may be that ve already have considerable information

in Bureau files.

The memoranda, being prepared should clearly

reflect that Jack Miller was formerly an Assistant AG

under Bobby Kennedy and is now a law partner of former

Kennedy is concerned.

These memoranda will be prepared on an expeditious

Criswell I felt certain these men would

do an excellent job and the Vice Fresident's

and stated he did not know Connell had

already made the request in question."

Sullivan Memoranda to John Dean

According to this memorandum, Mr. Connell told

Mr. De Loach that the fresident had, some time ago, advised

the Vice President that the FBI had sent a "special team"

to Atlantic City during the last Denocratic National

Convention.

The President allegedly told the Vice President

that the FBI had been of great service to him and he had

been given considerable information on a timely basis

throughout the entire convention.

Mr. Connell stated, according to the memorandum,

that while ho rosired to discuss this with the Director,

the Vice President hoped the Director would. extend to him

the same service during the forthcoming Democratic National.

Convention in Chicago.

The memorandum further states that Me. Connell

was told that, while he desired to discuss this matter

with the Director, he should know that our Chicago Office

is very well prepared to gather intelligence and pass such

intelligence onto appropriate authorities during the

convention.. Mr. Connell stated he presumed this to be

true; however, he would call again next week and mention

this matter to the Director. À handwritten notation by

fir. Hoover at the end of this memorandum stated "I talked

to Connell, also I talked, to SAC Joinson and issued

appropriate instructions."

A memorandum prepared by Mr. Hoover for Mr. Tolson,

Mo. De Loach, ir. Bishop, and iir. Sullivan dated August 15,

BIshn, 09

1968, reflects that at 10:09 a.m. Mr. Hoover talked to

MI. William Connell, Executive Assistant to the Vice President.

In connection with the Chicago Convention

because of the advanced information developed that

of disrupting the Convention and forcing the Government to

• utilize Federal troops to contain the cemonstrators.

exanple, the "fashington Post" issue of March 20, 196S,

quoted regro entertainer Dick Gregory as saying that so

many antivar. denonstrators will be put on the streets of

Chicago before the Convention that

"the Government will be

forced to uring the Any in."

Gregory indicated that

anti-Convention marchos vill begin at the end of day on a

12-hour basis and will later be conducted on a 24-hour basis.

Organizations planning to participate in these

demonstrations include the Students ior a Denocratic

Society,

the National Mobilization Comnittac to End the

Memorandum C.D. Brennan to Y.C. Sullivan

RE:

DEMONSTRATIONS AT THE NATIONAL

DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION, AUGUST, 1968

157-8589

OBSERVATIONS:

The assassinations of hartin Luther King; Jr.,

and Robert F. Kennedy serve, to illustrate the ugly atmosphere

of discontent which pervades the American political scene

today.

It is reasonable to expect that the extremist

elements planning to

disrupt the Democratic National

Convention may resort to violent. acts to draw attention to

their causes and achieve their objectives at the Convention.

We are making every effort to develop adequate

Informant coverage to enable us. to keep the intelligence

community advised of the day-to-day plans and activities of

the leaders of the dissident groups planning to disrupt the

Convention.

We cannot hope to fulfill our responsibilities

as an intelligence agency, however, unless we

take full

advantogo se all roans at our disposal to develop

necessary information.

The delay on the part of the Attorney General in.

acting on the request for a telephone surveillance in this

case is inexcusable.

We have, therefore, prepared a lollow-up

- memorandum to the Attorney General expressing concern over

the delay and again requesting a decision in this matter.

RECO.MENDATION:

That the attached memorandum to the Attorney

General be approved.

the entire convention.

Connell stated that, while he desired to discuss

this with the Director personally, the Vice President hope

the Director would extend to hin

the same service during

the forthcoming Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

I told Connell the Director would be back in his

office during the first part of the coming weck.

All-out Support to the Poor Peonle's March

The Poor People's March ori lashington has begun. Evidence of its grcat

poiver to mobilice ior the light against poverty is energing. The evidence should

be recognized and subliclacd..

Directed by Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy, leaders of the Southern Christian

Leadership Council, local progressive black leaders and far-sighica slute sup-

porters have hold meetings with President Juhnson's Cabinet and Congressional

leaders.

These meetings expose the hypocrisy of official governmental leadership and

the role of govemment in maintaining millions, especially black citizens, in pov

erty and misery.

What becomes obvious is that if poverty is to be abolished the people must

become abolitionists.

The Poor People's March can become an Instrument for mobilizing and acti

Izing millions against poverty.

Every phase of its development makes for the chlargement of struggle, the

• unification of the peopie and the loosing of creative ideas oi struggle.

II. Political Sionificance Vital

Ill. Impact of warch and the Folios Through

Reaction fears tie impact of the March on labor, black citizenry; youth,

the popularization of the jarch evarywhere, schoois, churches, labor bodies,

among sudents - everywhere. That cosularization should take the form of mos-

Ization In support. Constructive support demands discussion of the iallouua..

Chis is the essenco of the case since the varch is noi an end in itselí.

IV. Our Tasks.

The Negro Work. Depariment calls on all district leadership to recognize and

through action acknowledge possibilities for deepening and shamening the struggle

against poverty. This can lead logically to the question oi tha organiautior. or the

south, of the unorgenized and the unemployed. This step is not only vitally in-

portant in rolation to a successful light against poverty but in relation to evory

The logic of tits step as a follow-up flows out of the association of the

Narch with the strike of diemphis garbage workers and the unity of wiite-biuck

Correat steps in publicizing the march and lis massive ramifications can helo

THE WIDENING RIFT

i:

From all appearances,

the.honeymoon.between.the

black militants and

the New Leftists is about over.

An indication of this state

of affairs is the

recent disclosurc in "Now Left Notes," the Students for a

Domocratic Society (SDS) organ, nud

"The Black Panther,"

the official publication of the Black Panther Party (BPP),

that these two organizations have fallen out over the issue

of community control of the police. A decision to call jor

such control, reached at a recent United Front Afainst

Fascisn Conicrence hold in Oniland, California, and

sponsored by the BPP, was more at a hurdle than SDS could

SDS balked at white cormunity control of police.

In

a subscquent stätement by David Hilliard, a BPP official,

printed in the Party's newspaper, the rift between these

orsanizations was brought into the oven.

Hilliard charged

SDS with slogan haviting and not boing revolutionaries.

In

the usual gutter verracular, he bernted SUS as nationally

nationally socialistic.

what it could be considered) in a wishy-washy staterent

charactgrized itsolf as being dedicated to building a

revolutionary youth novenent anong white youth of the

"mother country."

This latter statement

has not set vell

with black militants.

More reccht evidence of this rift is indicated by

demands recently made by the Black United Front (BUF) in

Hashington, D. C., on the New Mobilization Comnittee (UNC).

This latter group, under the name of ilational lobilization

DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING U.S. PARTICIPATIONL

IN THE WAR IN VIETNAM

On O cober 15, 1969, an organization known as the

Vietnam liorate ium Committee

sponsored nation-wide demonstra-

S, to protest U.S. participation in the war

ine predominant theme of these demonstrations

was to remov

all U.S, troops fron Vietnam immediately.

Demonstratio; occurred in every stato and at a majority of

the colleges in the u.s.

There have been conflicting claims

as to the number of individuals who participated in these

demonstrations.

In view of t'e fact that these claims vary

greatly

depending upon the paitical viewpoint of the individual

making them, some analysis is necessary.

• To begin with, figures used by

individuals involved

For example, at

Hashington, D. C.,

the figure of 50,000 demonstrators is

claimed.

Actually: individuals capable ot estimaiin cione

size placed the number at not over 25,000.

In addition, at

many of the demonstrations it was difficult to separate the

demonstrators from spectators in estimating numbers.

•absonteeism ran high in colleges and high schools throughout

the coultry, the number of demonstrators on the campuses was

Obviously many of the students took the

opportunity to take the day off as most of the schools excused

anyone absent so they could take part in the Moratorium if

they desired.

It is also well to note that

many of the demonstrators

were pacifists based upon their religious belief and had as

their objective peace, not che withdrawal of U,s, troops from

Vietnam.

Reliable sources in the news media in the u.s..

estimate the total number of demonstrators as 500,000, the

majority of which were of high school and college age.

much as the population of the u.s.

exceeds 200,000, 000,

8, 000,000 of which are college students, it is obvious that

a very small part of the population took part in these

demonstrations. Even utilizing the Vietnam Moratorium Committee's

claims of 1,000,000 demonstrators, this would amount to only

1/200 of the population.

Utilizing the more reliable estimate

of 500,000, it would only amount to 1/100 of the population.

Even if the

entire 500,000 demonstrators were college students

they would only. amount to 1/1g of the youth presently

attending colleges in the U.S.

Viewed in this light, it is obvious that the

demonstrations were not a mass cry for inmediate withdrawal :

•Of U,S. troops from Vietnam but rather an indication that

of the individuals who are obviously next in line for

military service in Vietnam object to having their lives

disrupted by participating in a war which they cannot understand.

Documents Pertaining to the "Huston Plan, "

Cointelpro, and Other Practices and Programs

Subsequent publication of the Klan's activities resulted in a number

of Klan officials ceasing their activities, and no information was

developed indicating the Klan was able to expose informants through

the use of the polygraph.

2. On February 29, 1972, FBIHQ responded to a

request of the Louisville Field Office, authorizing an anonymous

letter be forwarded to a Black Panther Party (BPP) office in

New Yor' City. This anonymous letter contained a newspaper clip-

ping discrediting one Benjamin Franklin Simmons, a black extremist

endeavoring to affiliate with the Cleaver Faction of the BPP. Subse-

quently it was determined that "seeds of doubt"' concerning Simmons'

leadership qualities had been planted at the Cleaver Faction

Headquarter's.

Information relating to the above proposals and

authorizations did not appear in any Cointelpro-type file of this

Bureau. The proposals and authorizations were handled in substan-

tive organizational and individual files, and,no copies were placed

into a Cointelpro file.

The FBI communications approving the two

actions were reviewed by various officials at FBIHQ. Office proce-

dures in effect in Director J. Edgar Hoover's office at the time

indicate both proposals were approved by Mr. Hoover.

SUBJECT:

THE LONG COMMITTEE

The Attorney General called

on

the morning of

February 27, 1965, to advise he vanted to consult with the

Burciu on certain problems raised by the long Conmittee,

F.B

1s exploring the use of mail covers, et cetera. - He notéd there

was a possible problem concerning (Chief Inspector Montague's

testimonyand whether it was necessary for Montaguelto change

his testimony. Also, he felt that Internal Revenue Service had '

been using inv stigative techniques which they should not use

and this could pose a problem.

He said that the President had

asked him to coordinate with all executive agencies concerning

the problems raised by the.Long Committee.

Inspector Moore and I met with the

Attorney General in

his office this afternoon.

Mr. Courtney. Evans was present.

I

told the Attorney General that in Montague's testimony it was.

in the negative when asked questions touching on national

security.

With this interpretation, it was questionable whether

n attempt should be macie to change or explain Montague'

estimony 37

made it clear to the Attorney. General that from our dealings

with Montague,

he was a man of integrity and sacrificed

his

personal desires for the welfare of the country and, had cooperated

fully with us.

The Attorney General said he had

no intention

of changing one word of Montague's testimony, but he was

considering advising Iong and Fonsterwald that there were

dextome delicate national security matters touching on the areas

beiiig covered by the committee and. there could "be exceptions to

the answers given in the testimony whon they touched on such

sensitive security matters.

He said further that 'he.contemplates

seeing Senator long and impressing on him

that the comnittee

would not want to stumble by mistake into an area of extreme

interest to the national security as they nearly did in a matter

nficctin

Katzenbach contemplates

asking for a list of the witnesses who will appear before the

conmittee together with a brief summary of the expected testimony.

On the basis of this, he will be able to advise Senator Long.

I told hir. Katzerbach that I certainly agree that this

matter should be controlled.at the committee level but that

I felt pressure would have to be applied so that the personal

interest of Senator Long became involved rather than on any

ideological basis.

Mr. Katzenbach said that he had already

talked to Vice President Humphrey about Fensterwald, fa

amanterns was, and that Humphrey had promised to talk

to Long concerning Fensterwald.

Katzenbach said that in

addition to the Vice President he might have to resort to

pressure Irom the President himself, although he would prefer..

to work It out without resorting to the President.

He indicaled

there

no one on the committee itself no could be helpfu)..

Katzenbach said that he expected troublefrom the

possible activities of IRS and the military in the investigative

field; that if some of these matters are uncovered belore the

committee they will tend to undermine the restricted and

tightly controlled operations oi the Bureal.

I told him that

lour operations are tightly controlled and particularly in the

delicate areas of concexh, we restrict ourselves to important

security matters.

Hir. Katzenbach said he was going to see Senator Long.

on Monday and

wanted to know if the Bureau would like someone

to go along with him.

Itold, him no.

ACTION:

Hr. Katzenbach said he would advise us of the results

of his conversation with Long.

He also asked

that I advise

the

aCC:

EXCERPTS FROM THE TESTIMONY OF FORIER FBI INSPECTOR DONALD MOORE

WHETHER MR. KATZENBACH WAS INFORMED THAT THE FBI OPERATED

PROGRAIS

INVOLVING DIRECT ACCESS TO MAIL BY BUREAU AGENTS

27. Moore also testified that he informed

Attorney General Katzenbach in 1965 of the

fact

that the fBI did have on-going programs which,

at a minimum, involved direct access

bY FBI

agents to the mail

At 30: Mr. Moore.

One Saturday morning I

received a call from Mr. Belmont who asked

me to come to his office and see him.

I

don't remember whether he mentioned on the

phone, but I believe he did, that this

involved our mail coverage.

After meeting Mr. Belmont in his office,

he advised

me that

• on the previous

day the Chief Postal inspector, Mr. Montague

had testified before a subcommittee in

Congress.

Mr. Dick: Was this the Long Conmittee?

Mir. Moore.

Yes, it was before Senator

Long of Missouri. Mi. Montague had been

asked not to give any answers which would

in any way relate to national security

matters..

Mr. Dick. Who had asked him that?

1r. Moore. I presume it was the subcom-

mittee or the staff.

MI. Dick. I see.

I mean, this wasn't

something he was told by the Postmaster

General or. Attorney General prior to going

MI. MOOrC.

No,

no, 25 I understand it,

one of the questions asked Mr.. Montague

was whether mail ever left.-.

Mr. Moore. The hands of the Post Office:

Mr. Montague felt he could not give a

question or no answer without revealing

certain relationships with the FBI and he

answered. no, and apparently thereafter,

either immediately contacted Mi. Belmont,

or. the Attorney General, or both, and was

to make certain that he had answered cor-

rectly.

a. end!

Mr. Katzenbach does not

recall this meeting, although

he does not deny that it

occurred.

He testifiod that

he cannot remember ever being

informed by anyone in the

FBI, including 11r. belmont

and Mr. Moorc, that

the FBI. had direct

access to mail or that

the FBI ever oponed mail.

Mr. Belmont wanted me to go with him to

see the Attorney General.

ile talked to

Mr. Tolson, and thercafter Mi. Belmont

and I went to see Attorney General

Katzenbach.

I believe Mr. Katzenbach was awaru nf the

problem, but I don't know whether this had

been from a discussion with him by Mr.

Belmont or Mi. Montague.

le discussed the

problem of Mr. Montague's answer, because

he certainly did not want to respond in-

correctly to the subcommittee.

It was pointed out that we do receive mail

from the Post Office in certain sensitive

areas, and at the meeting I believe Nr.

Katzenbach agreed that he would talk to

senator long on this issue.

* * *

At 32: II. Moore.

•and Mr. Katzenbach did

not ask us for details of our arrangements

with the Post Office.

Ile just was told

that on some occasions we do obtain mail.

* **

Mr. Dick.

But he was made aware of the

fact that the Bureau would receive direct

access to mail --

Mr. Moore. Yes.

Mr. Dick. In its project?

Was he also made aware of the fact that

mail was actually, at least some mail,

was actually being opened by the Bureau?

Mr. Moore.

I can't say that we covered

the matter to that extent.

we did - the

problem concerned Mr. Montague's answer.

We wanted to let the Attorney General know

what the problem area was, and the fact

that we did receive some mail fron the post

office, it left the custody of the Post

Office.

And I do not believe we discussed

it further.

Mr. Dick. Do you recall whether he asked

why the Bureau wanted direct access to

mail?

AE 18:

Mr. Moore.

No, I do not. I had the

impression that there was no thought of us

discontinuing what we were doing.

Mr. Dick.

lle didn't ask whether mail was ..

being opened by the Bureau?

Mr. Moore. I don't believe so.

Mr. Dick: And he wasn't told this volun-

tarily by either yourself or Mr. Belmont?

Mr. Moore. I don't believe so.

I can't

be certain of that.

But I don't want to

say that he was specifically told that the

mail we reccived from the Post Office was

being opened.

***

Mr. Dick. Was he aware that these were

on-going projects, rather than isolated

instances? I am referring to Mr. Katzenbach.

MI. Moore. Yes, I believe he was.

* * *

Mr. Dick.

When you spoke to Mr. Katzenbach,

did you feel any need to hold back the

of the mail openings as opposed to the

that Bureau agents were getting direct

access to mail. Do you understand my ques-

tion?

Yes, I understand

your ques-

It is perhaps difficult to ansver.

Perhaps I could liken it to if you have a

defector in place in the KGB, you don't

want to tell anybody about the name, the

location, the title or anything like that.

• Not that you don't trust them completely,

• but the fact is anytime one additional

person becomes aware of it, there is a

potential for the information to be, to go

And I am sure if Mr. Katzenbach

asked any questions, he asked

meeting, I am

sure they were answered

fully, and truthfully.

Mr. Dick.

But you can't recall him asking

whether mail was opened?

MI.. Moore.

I can't . . ..
