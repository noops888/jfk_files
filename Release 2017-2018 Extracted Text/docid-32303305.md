The RCMP did not have any further particulars regarding

this meeting, however, assumed it was connected with union

activities in view of

the previous STERNMAN - ZAPAS connection.

It should be noted that the RCMP previously advised

that HYMAN STERNMAN is a prominent figure in the gambling

fraternity and was once engaged in "gray" steel marketing

in Chicago where he obtained steel in tight markets.

It should further be noted that numerous telephone

calls have been made from the offices of Local 46 to DAVIS

CG T-2 advised that "BARNEYY/BAKER,

a very good

friend of GUS ZAPAS, is selling steg as a

side line and

is also working at the Palmer House in a capacity unknown

to him. BAKER has been exhibiting paintings and telling

people the paintings are his work, however, he confided to

CG T-I that the paintings were actually the work of a fellow

inmate at Sandstone Penitentiary who did not want the paintings

and gave them to BAKER.
