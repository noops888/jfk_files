Buairtel 10/18/62 set out the original request for

investigation in this matter, whose primary objective, as the

Bureau has noted, 1s to determine if any commissions resulting

from captioned operations are being received by the DORMANs,

HOFFA or others close to HOFFA and the Teamsters.

From the

information made

available by Departmental

Memo 10/15/62, It Is obvious that certain investigation has

been conducted at Republic National Lile (inL of dallas, Texas,

probably by CARL SCHULTZ, Bureau of Labor Management Reports,

interview with FRANK WRIGHT of United Bonding Company,

Indianapolis, Indiana, which was performed on 10/23/62 and

reported in report of SA KENNETH P. PETTIJOHN dated 10/25/62

at Indianapolis, under this section's caption.

Chicago is of

the opinion that results of interview of WRIGHT which had

previously been conducted by WALTER SHERIDAN of the Department

and Mr. SCEWARTZ (probably CARL SCHULTZ) should have been

made available to the Bureau by the Department prior to interview.

It is also observed that among other things an

with CHARLES BRAY was requested in the Teamster

Bonding Program, hereinafter discussed.

For the Bureau's

confidential information, during the course of the Federal

Grand Jury investigation

into the Teamsters Union Pension

Fund Loans in Chicago during August-October, 1962, one of

the Departmental Attorneys was overheard to remark that

WALTER SHERIDAN of the Department has been in contact with

CHARLES BRAY and apparently has received information from

BRAY and is attempting to develop BRAY as an informant. Chicago

is of the opinion that if such is the case,

the results of

SHERIDAN's contacts with BRAY should be made available to

Chicago prtor to any attempt at lurther interview of BraY.

It is also obvious that other investigation and/or

interviews have been conducted by others prior to the Bureau's

entrance into these cases.

References to these prior

Investigations are scattered throughout the various Departmental

Memoranda submitted; Chicago is of the opinion that results of

any investigation by whomsoever conducted should be made

available in its original form, or by copies thereof, to the

Bureau offices for information, evaluation and guidance.

With respect to captioned subject matter, Chicago,

for the present, contemplates limiting its investigation to

the Teamsters Union Pension Fund Loans which were the subject

of Federal Grand Jury Inquiry In Chicago. Reviews of files

and certain subpoenaed material are being made and appropriate

leads will be set out shortly.
