-, understand that upon enter-

ing on duty with the Central Intelligence Agency I am undertaking a posi-

tion of trust in that Agency of the Government responsible to the Presi-

dent and the National Security Council for intelligence relating to the

security of the United States of America. I understand that in the

course of my employment I will acquire information about the Agency and

its activities and about intelligence acquired or produced by the Agency.

2. I have read and understand the provisions of the Espionage Act, Title

18, USC, secs. 793 and 794, and I am aware that unauthorized disclosure

of classified information relating to the national defense may subject

me to prosecution for violation of that Act, whether such disclosure be

made while I am an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency or at any.

time thereafter.

3. In addition, however, as I am undertaking a position of trust, I have

a responsibility to the Central Intelligence Agency not to disclose any

classified information relating to the Agency without proper authoriza-

tion. I undertake, therefore, not to discuss with or disclose to any

person not authorized to hear it such information relating to the Central

Intelligence Agency, Its activities, or to intelligence material under

the control of the Agency. I further understand that this undertaking

1s & condition of my employment with the Central Intelligence Agency, that

its violation may subject me to immediate dismissal for cause or other

appropriate disciplinary action, and that this undertaking shall be equally

binding upon me after my employment with the Agency as during it.

4. I understand that the burden is upon me to ascertain whether or not

Information 1s classified and If so, who is authorized to receive 1t,

and, therefore, I will obtain the decision of authorized officials of

the Agency on these points prior to disclosing information relating to

the Agency, and failure to obtain such a decision will be grounds for my

dismissal.

5. I understand that my unauthorized action or utterance in the nature

of a publication or which would reasonably be expected to result in pub-

licity on intelligence or intelligence activities would be in violation

of Government and Agency regulations and would be grounds for my dismissal.

paragraph 3. Il the appeal procedures are inadequate in any situation,

I am aware that the Inspector General 1s at all times available to any

telligence Agency is conditioned upon my understanding of and strict

compliance with CIA Security Regulations, and the appendices thereto.

nection with my official duties with the Central Intelligence Agency

and intelligence in my possession.

reservations or purpose of evasion. I
