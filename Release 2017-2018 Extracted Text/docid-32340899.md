Association in Miami. ROSADO and GONZALEZ are not friends

and are on different

sides politically speaking, GONZALEZ

being "more liberal".

ROSADO was in contact with him in Miami

in connection with Cuban exile activities until late 1969,

when ROSADO came to California. He is not 'considered to be

the type to engage in any such activities

as bombing. There

is no ill feeling between him and ROSADO.

(3) DI. HUMBERIO FONTANA is not known to ROSADO.

(4) LUIS TORNES was president, (if not president

at least a member), of the Veterans of Brigade 2506 in Miami

for one year shortly after the brigade was organized. ROSADO

may have seen him occasionally at Cuban exile functions in

Miami after TORNES ceased being an official of the brigade,

until 1968 at the latest: ROSADO has not met him or corresponded

with him or heard from him through anyone else since 1968.

There is no ill feeling between him and ROSADO.

(5) The idea of anyone transporting a "bomb"

lof the sort used in connection with the captioned bombing), Fron

Miami to California, particularly to deliver it to ROSADO, is

ridiculous and laughable.

Whoever might make such an allegation

against ROSADO is not known.

However, its falseness is manifest

as is an allegation ROSADO was connected with a letter signed

"EZEQUIEL" which was sent to the Cuban Chamber of Commerce in

Los Angeles, not long after the assassination. of TORRIENTE in

Miami, threatening a dozen or so local Cubans.

"EZEQUIEL" waS

an underground name for ROSADO in Cuba, which

fact is fairly

well known, and ROSADO would never use a name

easily traceable

to himself.

It is recalled that MM 974-S furnished information

EGUES CASILIONO NeWarK, IGNACIO NOVO of Union City, (NJ, and

PEDROYDRUZ of costa Rica to play a series of bombings.

information, attributed to "rumor", has been invalidated so

far as ROSADO is concerned, his employer having confirmed that

Le was it work on hit thore specifiod days. (dU)
