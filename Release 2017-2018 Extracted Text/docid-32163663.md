A report was

under reference 175A-DL-109 from the Office

of Legal Attache, US Embassy, London

wherein it was requested that

further enquiries

be made in

the UK to assist a current investi-

subject and previous UK enquiries had tentatively identified the

She initially considered

informing the authorities but decided against it as she didn't

wish to bring herself to attention.

She denied ever being

interviewed by the New Orleans Police Department during the Clay

SHAW trial.

She was aware of the nature of this trial and was

aware of the name Clay SHAW within the attorneys office but she

cannot now remember in what context.

She cannot remember the attorney's name but agreed

that it could

She described him as being 30 io 40 years

old, thickset, 5 feet 10 inches tall, dark hair and swarthy

From conversations with the wife, described as dark
