BLACK PANTHER PARTY, aleo known as

Black Panther Party

According to the offluial newspaper of the

Black Panther Party (BPP), the BPP was started during

December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to organize

black people so they can take control of the life,

politics and the destiny of the black community.

It was

organized by Bobby G. Seale, BPP Chairman, and Huey P.

Newton, Minister of Defense, BPP.

The official newspaper, called "The Black Panther,"

regularly states that the BPp advocates the use of guns :

and guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary progiam to end

oppression of the black people. Residents of the black

community are urged to arm thenselves against the police

who are consistently referred to as "pigs" who should be

killed.

The newspaper, in its issue of September 7,

1968, had an article by

• the then Minister of Education

George Murray.

This article ended with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored pelsons of .

America, revolt everywhere!

Arm yoursclves.

The only

culture worth keeping is revolutionary culture. Change.

Ercedon everywhere.

Dynamite! Black power. Use the gun.

Kill the pigs everyvhere."

The Bpp newspaper, issue of October 5, 1968,

had an article introduced with the following

statement:

"We will not dissent from Anerican government.

We will

overthrow it."

David Hilliard, Chief of Staff, BPP, in a speech

at the San Francisco Polo Field on

said, "We will kill. Richard Nixon, „ovember 15, 1969,

David Hilliard, in tha

"New York Times," issue

of December 13, 1969, was quoted as follows:

"We advocato.

the very direct overthrow of the government by way of force

•and violence."

In the issue of april 25, 1970, the BPP

newspaper had an

article by Minister-of Culture Enory

Douglas as follows:

"The only. way to make this racist U. S.

Government administoi justice to the people it is

oppressing, is

•. by taking up arms against this

government, killing the officials, until the reactionary

forces

are dead, and those that are left turn their

weapons on their superiors, thercby passing revolutionary

judgement against the number one enemy of all mankind,

the racist U. S. Government."

The BPP headquarters is located at 1016 Poralta

Street, Oakland, California.

Branches of the BPP, and

Committees to Combat Fascism, under control of the BPP,

have been established in various locations in the U.s.

arrested following an unsuccessful attempt to rob the Chase

On October 16, 1972, WF I-5 obtained a pocket-sized

booklet titled "Look and See"

, which identifies the author as

Hamaas Abdul Khaalis, and is documented as published for the

'Hanafi Madh-.habCenter, Islam Faith, United States of America

American Mussulmans Headquarters, A.S.F.M.I., 7700 16th

Street, Horthwest, WDC."

The 113 page booklet describes the Hanafi Mussulmans

as a "Standard of Mankind; a standard in practice and in living

an upright life." It states In part that "Hanafi has many

meanings"; that Hanafi means "the pure, the clean through,

upright, those who fear to the death only Allah; It is unswerving,

not deviating, not innovating from the Way of the Prophets Side."

Review of the booklet by a representative of the FBI

discloses it continues throughout in a religious vein, including

phrases and verse, in a rambling style, referring frequently

to "Mussulman" synonymously with "Muslim." The booklet appears

to be directed for the benefit of Asian, African and Arabian

people, but it calls upon the betterment of America as its goal,

and proclaims its alleglance to the United States. The booklet

makes no reference to the collection or maintenance of weapons,

nor any call for violent activity.

With regard to "A.S.F.M.I.", which appears in the

WE I-5 advised on November 17, 1972, that meetings

The meetings appear to be limited to members of the organization

and those attending by invitation of a member.

WE T-5 was

In a position to state that one such meeting was attended by •

approximately ten males and seven females; another meeting by

approximately six males and three females. The following

additional information was obtained by WF I-5 concerning

the Hanafi American Mussulmans Urganization.

Ramaas Abdul Khaalis is the leader of the Mussulmans

• Organization and appears to the above source to be mentally

unstable.

He claims to have known personally all presidents

of the United States since Harry S. Truman, and states he was

able to forsee, in 1963, the death of President John f. Kennedy;

that he had

conversationswith the mother of Kennedy's

assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, and believes the Kennedy assassination

was a Jewish plot. WE I-S had once heard Khalis state the

Hanafi Mussulman organization is anti-semetic, but no specific

reference

to indicate the basis for the anti-semetic position.

Khaalls has been known to state a 'true Muslim" can

forsee certain things; claiming he had been foretold that Sonny

Liston would die prior to the death of the former heavyweight

boxer.

Khaalls claims the Islam advanced by the Mussulmans

Organization is the true Islam, which came originally from

India, and although not a prophet of Allah, he has been chosen

to teach the true Islam. According to Khaalis, the true

Mussulman teaches love and not the ideology of other black

groups such as Elijah Muhammed, leader of the Nation of Islam,

or Malcolm X. Khaelis has been known to state in the past

his organization disdains the civil rights movement, and he

has been heard to refer to prominent past civil rights

proponents as 'Martin Luther Coon" and "Ralph Abernasty",

and to classify blacks who preach the Pan-African concept as

"bushy hairs''. Khaalis in his writings and oral statements has

proclaimed the United States as the home of the Mussulman, not

Africa.

Concerning

; the Hanafi Rifle and Pistol Club, WF T-5

learned the club has been in the formative stage for several

months and recently obtalned some sort of charter. Khaalis

has been heard to state classes in karate

weze also going to be taught, and this was all necessey to

be able to'deal" with the "bushy hairs" if the occasion should

arise. He claims plans to recruit 20,000 members for the

rifle and pistol club.

WE T-5 advised people use the Juniper Street side

door to enter and exit the premises at 7700 16th Street,

Northwest. A sign is on display in the hallway ordering no

smoking, no narcotics, nor dangerous weapons. Individuals

entering are usually searched. The living room on the ground

floor facing 16th Street is used for prayer and other meetings,

those entering being required to remove their shoes. Small

mattresses are on the floor and are utilized for sitting during

the meetings.

The living room wall is decorated with several

diffexent kinds of machetes and swords. There is no indication

of any target or storage area for weapons on the first floor.

Khaalls has never been heard to advorate any acts of

violence except for self defense. He has never urged for

confrontation with police, and to the contrary has instructed

that no true Muslim would violate the law.

Contact with the MPI has disclosed no applications

for additional gun permits since August, 1972, from individuals

who appear to be affiliated with the Hanafi Mussulmas

Urganization. MiD investigation, according to the MPD

representative mentioned earlier in this memorandum, has

disclosed that on August 17, 1972, Alfonso Spencer James

purchased three "Marksman"

pistols, a common target shooting weapon for which gun permit

1s not required for purchase, and on September 13, 1972, a

Bureau notes that on two occasions in the IM, para-

graph 4 on page 1 and paragraph 3 on page 2, you set forth

results of investigation without accounting for how the informa-

tion was obtained. This is an undesirable practice and should

be avoided in future subnissions.

A rereading of paragraph 6, page 2 of the LiM, will

reveal to you that it gives the erroneous impression that

subject was "incarcerated for the purpose of preparing a pre-

sentence report."

Because there has been no other communication sub-

mitted for disseminative purposes, containing information set

forth in the referenced LIM, another I'M should be submitted,

prepared in accordance with above-mentioned items. Insure

your cover communication accounts for local dissemination to

Secret Service and to U. S. Marshal.

NOTE:

LHM submitted with WFO airtel 7/25/74 does not set

forth background information regarding the Hanafi murders in

Washington, D. C., in 1/73. Seven persons were murdered at

the Hanafi

American Mussulman's Rifle Club, an orthodox

Islamic group on 1/18/73 and seven males associated with the

Nation of Islam in Philadelphia were charged with the murders.

The presiding judge in the trial of the seven men charged

with the mass murders, Judge Braman, has two sons, one attending

East Carolina State University, Greenville, North Carolina,

and the other attending Vanderbilt University, Nashville,

Tennessee. Results of investigation concerning possible

harassment of the Judge's sons were set forth in the LHM and

need

to be reported in form suitable for dissemination

because of possible 001 aspects.

WASHINGTON, D. C.

On July 9, 1974, convicted defendants Theodore

Moody, William Christian and John Clark were sentenced

to seven consecutive life terms each.

The conviction

of John Griffin, however, was set aside.

On March 31, 1974, Judge Leonard Braman advised

through the United States Marshal's Service, Washington,

D. Co, that his son, Barrett Breman, who attends East :

Carolina State University in Greenville, North Carolina,

had been recently harassed by several Negro males driving

& late model Cadillac bearing District of Columbia (D.G.)

License 933-350 or 933-530.

Barrett Breman advised a representative of the

FBI on March 31, 1974, that he was walking alone in

downtown Greenville, North Carolina, on the early morning

of that date when he observed the above vehicle.

HANAFI AMERICAN MUSSULMAN'S

RIFLE AND PISTOL CLUB

On April 10, 1974, a representative of the

MPD advised that he had received the following information

regarding an incident in Nashville, Tennessee,

where

Judge Breman's second son, David Breman, attends Vanderbilt

University in that city:

At approximately 3:00 a.M. on April 7, 1974,

a Negro male appeared at the residence of one Steve

Bonner, a personal friend of David Breman, 2113A Acklan

Avenue, Nashville, Tennessee, and inquired whether a

Dave lived there.

Bonner then told this individual

that no one by the name of Dave lived there and this

individual then departed. The individual was described

by Bonner as a Negro male, age 25-30.

Investigation at Nashville determined that the

above

individual who visited Bonner was one Roger Parnel

Oden, who was looking for the home of one David Graham,

a friend who resided in the neighborhood. Oden reportedly

had been drinking and was seeking a night's lodging with

his friend.

Records of the Nashville, Tennessee, Police

Department, reflect six drunk and disorderly arrests

since 1970, and one narcotics possession arrest in 1971.

On June 24, 1974, a representative of the

United States Marshal's Service advised that his office

and Judge Braman had just received a pre-sentence report

from the District of Columbia Probation Office (DCPO)

which reflected the following information:

On June 19, 1974, Probation Officer Donald

Pryor, DCPO, interviewed convicted defendant William

Christian at the Baltimore City Jail, Baltimore, Maryland,

where he is currently incarcerated for the purpose of

preparing a pre-sentence report.

RIFLE AND PISTOL CLUB

During the course of the interview, while

discussing concurrent and consecutive sentences; Christian

stated "The Judge won't live that long". When pressed

about what he had meant by that statement, Christian

stated that with the long sentence which he was facing,

he would outlivé the Judge and that in general the

fate of everyone responsible for the prosecution of the

Hanafi case, including the police, the prosecutors and

the Judge was in Allah's hands.

Continuous contact with Judge Braman has

been maintained, and he has been furnished, on a continuous

basis, information regarding the Nation of Islam.

On July 19, 1974, Judge Braman was interviewed

in his chambers, at which time he advised that neither

he nor his family had received any additional information

of a threatening nature. Judge Braman stated that he

still had United States

Marshal protection and would

have this protection until defendants Harvey and James

Price stand trial, which is tentatively set for September 9,

1974.

The memorandum referred to above, identified

Hamaas

Abdul Khaalls, also known as Ernest Timothy McGhee, as the

leader of the

Hanafi Mussulmans Organization, and reported the D,d,

captioned Rifle and Pistol Club was apparently in the forma-

tive stages. Khaalis was described by a confidential

informant in this memorandum as being an apparently unstable

individual who displayed anti-Semitic feelings and spoke

unfavorably of certain black civil rights proponents as well

as those blacks currently advocating a Pan-Africanist or black

nationalist concept.

Khaalis was reported to have never been

known to advocate any acts of violence except for self-defense,

and has been heard to instruct that no true Muslim (Mussulman)

would violate the law.

A confidential source who has furnished reliable

information in the past advised on November 27, 1972, that

weekly classes in Islam continued to be held at the Hanafi

Mussulmans' Headquarters, 7700 16th Street, N.W., nearly every

Sunday afternoon during November. Hamaas Abdul Khaalis is in

charge of these classes which consist mainly of Khaalis'

ramblings about the Islamic faith.

Khaalis has indicated

there are other Mussulman organizations, mentioning he had

recently visited one such group in New York. He has stated

he hopes the organization will expand to include their own

lawyers, dentists, and doctors, and announced plans to

eventually open up a bakery.

The above source noted no indications of planned

acts of violence on the part of the Hanafi Mussulman Organi-

zation, but observed a pre-occupation with the subject of

self-defense on the part of Khaalis. In this connection,

• Khaalis has announced the establishment of a karate school,

scheduled to be opened in late December, 1972, in the 4800

Block of Georgia Avenue, N.W., and he has been heard to

remark that although the Mussulmans organization is a peace-

ful one, they are vicious fighters when called upon to fight.

This source

further observed previously noted

indications that Khaalis was anti-Senetic, citing as an

example a recent remark by Khaalis that "Hitler was a friend

of the Mussulmans, having ordered the killing of six million

Jews. "

Khaalis was also observed by the above source to

remark recently concerning Kareem Abdul Jabbar, alleging he

had spoken with the Milwaukee Bucks basketball star recently

by telephone. Khaalis gave the impression Jabbar had been a

former member of the Mussulmans Organization, and that he

may seek to rejoin. Khaalis was critical of

Jabbar for con-

tacting him by telephone, stating Jabbar should know the

phone is "tapped", and further criticized Jabbar for greeting™

him in the Arabic language, claiming Arabic should only be

used for prayers and not as a telephonic greeting.

It was determined by a Special Agent of the FBI

through visual observation of the premises located at 4803

Georgia Avenue, N.W., Washington, D. C., on December 1, 1972,

that this store-front property was at that time vacant, but

appearing in lettered form on the front door is the wording,

"Chung Do Kwon Karate Dojo, Hanafi Madh-hab Training Center,

USA Headquarters."

On December 1, 1972, a second confidential source,

who has furnished reliable information in the past, advised

the Hanafi Mussulmans organization at 7700 16th Street,

Washington, D. C., is a very small group, which also is

organized in Chicago and New York. Source did not believe

the organization to be well organized. This- source, as well

as other confidential informants, contacted during November-

December, 1972, advised no information had been developed to

indicate the Hanafi group was a violent group or likely to

engage in black extremist activity.

Une of three individuals arrested with Abdul Aziz

in the April 1, 1966 attempted bank robbery referred to above

was identified

according to Detective Schaetzle, supra, as

Abdul Latif, true name Carl koper. Records of the Identification

Division, FBI indicate this individual was born April 30, 1943

at New Rochelle, New York. He was sentenced to an indefinite

term at the New York City Penitentiary by the Supreme Court

of New York,

on November 22, 1966.

On October 16, 1972, WY I-S obtained a pocket-sized

booklet titled "Look and See"

, which identifies the author as

Hamaas Abdul Khaalis, and is documented as published for the

"Hanaft Madh-. hab Center, Islam Faith, United States of America-

American Mussulmans Headquarters, A.S.I.M.I., 7700 16th

Street, ilorthwest, WDC."

The 113 page booklet described the Hanafi Mussulmans

as a

"Standard of Mankind; a standard in practice and in living

an upright life." It states in part that "Hanafi has many

meanings"; that Hanafi means "the pure, the clean through,

upright, those who fear to the death only Allah; it is uriswerving,

not deviating, not innovating from the Way of the Prophets Side."

Review of the booklet by a representative of the FBI

discloses it continues throughout in a religious vein, including

phrases and verse, in a rambling style, referring frequently

to "Mussulman" synonymously with "Muslim." The booklet appears

to be directed for the benefit of Asian, African and Arabian

people, but it calls upon the betterment of America as its goal,

and proclalms its allegiance to the United States. The booklet

makesno reference to the collection or maintenance of weapons,

nor any call for violent activity.

publishing docuentation of the booklet, "Look and See"

that he had conversationswith the mother of Kennedy's

assassin, Lee llarvey Uswald, and believes the Kennedy assassination

was a Jewish plot. WE I.5 had once heard Khaalis state the

Hanafi Mussulman organization is anti-semetic, but no specific

reference to indicate

the basis for the anti-semetic position.

Khaalis has been known to state a "true Muslim" can

forsee certain things; claiming he had been foretold that Sonny

proponents as "Martin Luther Coon" and "Ralph Abernasty",

and to classify blacks who preach the Pan-African concept as

"bushy hairs". Khaalis in his writings and oral statements has

proclaimed the United States as the home of the Mussulman, not

Africa.

Concerning the Hanafi Rifle and Pistol Club, WE T-5

learned the club has been in the formative stage for several

has been heard to state classes in karate and

self-defense

was all necessary to

be able to"deal" with the "bushy hairs" if the occasion should

be utilized by Evans and/or his attorney to attempt to show harassment.

This was discussed with the Department and the Department concurred

that no interview should be conducted with Evans at this time. This has

been comirmed in writing.

Evans is the leader of the so-called "New Libya Group" which

is being investigated as an intelligence matter. This organization is

reportedly opposed to integration of the races. The members state that

the stars and heavens are foretelling the doom of the "beast" (white man)

and the victory of the black man. Evans has stated his followers owe

no allegiance to the white man's laws and has counseled children not to

attend public schools. Most, if not all the members, drink wine and liquor

to excess, smoke pot and engage in sexual promiscuity. The members

reportedly do not work and obtain their money through the commission

of burglaries and other criminal activities. There has been no evidence

to indicate the "New Libya Group" is part of a national organization.

Members have mentioned visiting "brothers" in Detroit and Columbus,

Ohio, but there is no known contact between the "New Libya Group" members

and similar organizations in other cities.

The Department is being kept advised of the developments in the

Cleveland situation on a current basis.

On January 25, 1972, SA MORTON C. NICKELL reviewed

the file of Assistant United States Altorney WILLIAM C.

IBERSHOF, Detroit, and there appeared to be no further

developments concerning the prosecution of any of the

subjects.

Contained in the file was & letter from

DI: DAVID G. HUBBARD, Psichiatry,

713 Noel Page Building,

Dallas, Texas, to the

effect he wished to examine PLISKON

for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and at the

request of JIN MURPHY,

Chief of Security for FAA.

The

conditions of the examination was that no one would know of

the examination and he would not be called as a witness by

either side.

On Octobex 12, 1971, Mr. IBERSHOE wrote him saying

these conditions were not acceptable. He went on to say

this dia

not prevent Dr. HUBBARD from examining her as a

defense witness and to testily.

On October 15, 1972, there appeared a letter

from

Mr. IBERSHOE tO

the Wayne County Sheriff to the effect

DI. HUBBARD WaS in to examine PLISKOY and he had no objection

to the examination.

There was nothing in the file to show if

an examination had

been made, or if one was made, or the

results thereof.

The attorney for PLISKOW iS HAROLD E. LEITHAUSER,

3400 Guardian Building, Detroit.

The attorney

for JACKSON

iS GERALD M, KAMINSKI,

2919 Lemans, Hantranck, Michigan,

telephone TR 2-5370.

On March 22, 1972, SA NICKEiL discussed

this case

with hir. IBERSHOE, who stated that he did not see where an

interview of Dr. HUBBARD would contribute anything to this

case since it was understood he was not to testify and,

therefore, his

testimony would be privileged. Defense

attornies

have indicated they will

have their cun psychiatrist

examiue PLISKOW, and if this is done, the government will have

her examined subsequent to receiving

the report of any

psychiatric examination made by the defense.

The attornies

for PLISKON have indicated they wish to use the defense of

irisanity but from information received by fir. IBERSHOF,

PLISKOY does not desire to use this defense in

any trial.

It was believed that the potential hijacker was

a woman.

A detective from the Detroit Police Department,

DOKENDORE, saw a suspicious woman and followed her to Gate

16. The woman and other passengers at Gate 16 were about

to board a bus, which would take them out to an airplane.

As the woman and other passengers walked down a

stairway toward the bus, PERMAN approached the

woman from the

left rear and tapped her on the left shoulder. PERMAN said, '

"Just a minute lady"

, but the woman continued down the stairs.

At this point, the woman turned back and looked at PERMAN

who was holding his credentials in view to identity himself.

The woman quickly went for her bag, saying, "I've got a

: Loaded gun and dynamite in here, ané we're all going to be

blown up"

ADMINISTRATIVE

On September 24, 1971, the Detroit Police Department,

Special Investigation Division, telephonically advised the FBI

that a confidential informant provided information that BARBARA

PLISKOW was to board American Airlines Flight 124 on September

24, 1971, and hijack the plane by means of a gun and bomk in an

effort to obtain the release of MICHAEL D. HILL and RONNIE IRWIN.

INFoRMAthis information substantiated information furnished

bY DE 1330-E on September 22, 1971, to the effect that BARBARA

PLISKO, and BRINDA JACKSON appeared to be involved in some type

known specifically what the incident would be. Subsequently

Pen vas dare told:

At this time it was not

der of a suspected informant; an explosion to embarrass

President RICHART) M. NIXON during his visit to Detroit on

September 23, 1971; and to hijack an airplane for purposes

of extorting

the release of MICHAEL D. HILL and RONNIE IRWIN.

As a result of this information, it was felt probable

cause existed to arrest BRENDA JACKSON as a part of the con-

spiracy to hijack American Airlines Flight 124. At the time

of the arrest. of JACKSON at her apartment, the following persons

were also taken into custody:.

CASSAndrA ParKER, MARY FORD,

DAVID REEDUS, ROBERT/SMITH, and PATRICIADUNCAN.

These

individuals were taken into custody primarily because they

refused to identify themselves and because source information

also indicated they attended a meeting in which the hijacking

plan was formulated. Subsequently, PARKER, FORD, SMITH, and

DUNCAN were released from Federal custody but FORD was turned

over to Detroit Police Department on local charges.

On September 29, 1971, Detective Sergeant IVOR

WILLIAMS, Saventh Precinct, Detroit Police Department, ad-

vised that he had positivaly identified FORD, SMITH, and

REEDUS as the individuals who committed a robbery, armed,

in Detroit on September 19, 1971. He obtained warrants

for REEDUS and SMITH but since FORD is a juvenile, he is

seeking a waiver from the Juvenile Court in order

to try

her

as an adult.

He advised that he was informed by the

'Homicide Bureau that FORD has been tentatively identified

as one of the individuals responsible for a mass murder in

Detroit involving eight people.

In regards to the murder of the suspected informant,

source information indicated that DAVID REEDUS, in company

with others, killed WILLIAM JAMES FLOYD, 2125 Garland, during

the early morning hours of September 24, 1971. After killing

FLOYD, they took from him a .25 caliber

automatic which was

subsequently used by PLISKOW

in the hijacking attempt.

Deputy MARTIN STRESS, Wayne County Sheriff's Office,

Metropolitan Airport, Romulus, Michigan, furnished the following

information:

At approximately 7:35 AM, September 24, 1971, he

received a radio message to report to MI. PATTERSON Of Americán

Airlines at their boarding area.

advised by Mr. PATTERSON that a woman on board Flight 124 was

possibly carrying explosives and that all passengers had been

asked to deplane.

He was furnished a description of this woman

and as the passengers deplaned, he observed a

woman fitting this description leaving the plane.

This woman did

not proceed with the other passengers but rather left the boarding

area and began walking through the terminal.

He followed her

to an area in front of the Northwest Orient Airlines ticket

counter where he observed Deputy United States Marshal GERALD

PERMAN.

At this time, he requested Deputy PERMAN to continue

following the woman as she

appeared nervous and he feared she

would recognize he was following her.. He then observed Deputy

PERMAN fOllow her to the gift shop in the terminal which he

entered.

At this time, he observed Detective CAL LAPIEN, Michigan

State Police; and Detective LAWRENCE DOKENDORE of the Detroit

Police Department and pointed the woman out to them.

He next

observed the woman proceeding down the concourse leading to the

American Airlines satellite and thereafter lost sight of her

and Deputy PERMAN.

When he arrived at the satellite, he observed the

same woman struggling with officers who were attempting to

subdue her.

He observed her brown pocketbook at the top of

the stairwell leading to the lower concourse and what he

believed to be sticks of dynamite, one on a chair and another

at the bottom of the stairwell.

Aiter the woman was removed,

he assisted Captain BÉRRY of the Wayne County Sheriff's Office

in removing the dynamite and placing it in a tank in the bomb

truck which had arrived at the boarding gate. He last saw the

woman at the Wayne County Sheriff's Office, Metropolitan Airport,

where she was taken following her arrest.

Mile and Grand River, was interviewed by SA PETER D. MC CANN,

Federal Bureau of Investigation, Detroit, Michigan, at the

Metropolitan Detroit - Wayne County Airport, concerning the

attempted hijacking

of an American Airlines

flight from Detroit

to New York.

HURLEY advised that he was called at 7:40 AM at his

and together they proceeded to the main lobby candy counter area,

whereupon the white female suoject exited the

candy area and

entered the Gate 16 area.

HURLEY advised that when next viewed,

the woman

was sitcing next to the Gate 16 exit. Everybody at the

gate area started to move down the stairs to the aircrait ramp

area.

At this point JAMES PERMAN requested her identification and

a fight started immediately. HURLAY grabbed the woman's legs and

helped to hold her down.

He saw her hand reach for her handbag

at which time DORKENDORF (Phonetic) shouted "She's got a gun",

at the scene.

Her luggage was one-half way down the stairs and

she was inmediately removed physically from the area of her luggage.
