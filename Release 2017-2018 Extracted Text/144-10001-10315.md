After 23 hours of flying, I arrived in Washington Saturday

at about 0200 hours in the night. The welcoming formalities were

carried out by RUSK and the top officials of the State Department.

Mr. RUSK was assigned to meet all foreign representatives;

even the heads of state.

Two kings and the Queen of Greece, eight presidents, three

crown princes, and four members of royal families, thirty prime

ministers and foreign ministers attended these ceremónies;: but :with-

out any doubt at all the outstanding personality at this gathering

was General DE GAULLE, and the next most outstanding was ERHARD,

despite the fact that the German. Président was present too:

The funeral ceremonies

were splendid and magnificent, and it is

said that Washington has

seen nothing like them since the burial of

the Unknown Soldier.

After the internment ceremonies, all the representatives went

to the White House so that Mrs. KENNEDY might thank them: While

talking with

p. Mrs, KENNEDY said, "I thank the great l

very, much for sending

to Washington

on his behalf to,'attend my husband's funeral."

Moreover she men-

tioned her pleasant memories of the days when

were here.

Then the new president received all the representatives in

the White House and thanked them. In this reception: Mr. JOHNSON

of days there he will go to New York, and on Saturday he will leave

from New York. All the representatives left, in the course of last

possible to arrange a meeting with him. However, Mr. TALBOT 1s

embassy.
