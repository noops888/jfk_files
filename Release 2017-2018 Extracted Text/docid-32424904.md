At "en Lansdale's request, fir. Harvey opened the meeting by

ElVIng a general operational status report. Fe discussed tears,

ete., In some detall, Indicating thatthe aissions of tre teams

was Intelligence collection, controls and the development of

latent resistant areas. The quallty of the Opa Locka Interrogatic

Center - reports have been good. 150 are coming in per week on

an average

of possible intelligence reports. Very little of high

level political intelligence has been avallable. However, tremen-

dous amounts of counter-intelligence 1s being received. Informa-

tion on 300 Cuban agents per week, for example. ligthing so far

uncovered in the intelligence area changes the basic conclusions

nade originally by cis; at the outset of this task. However,

con

for the most part, conclusions häio been firned by further 1nform

tion. Generally sabotage 1s decreasing in Cubà. The operational

problems of putting in agents are getting tougher and tougher.

The controls by the Communists in Cuba are getting tighter and

tighter and will slow down the operation. Agents must have

documents, to get docurents you must register, wten you register

the Bloc Informer checks on you periodically. Inis makes 1t

tough to get ration cards. Some few cuban agenis have been comin

In through the Opalocka Center. Mir. Kennedy asled hoir abut the

backlog of refugees - sore 75,000 peopie coning in through Opa

Locha in the Miami area prior to beginning of this operations

intelligence center there. How about a progran to assure that

these 75,000 sourses are exploited. Is. Harvey indicated CiA

had a plan to est this don, to date they have been unable to hit

a bia part or the bachloe, but in cortain spocial cases tave beer.

Ecttino information fron then, that they have a plan for this

that this was correct, that it was the responsibllity of the JCS

to make recommendations oi this nature.

Mr. Goodwin did not pursue the matter further at this tire.

Mr. Goodwin then queried me in regard to the reactions capabiliti

of the US forces in other countries of iatin Aerica, that if such.

a requirement occurred while we were enzaged in Cuba, this seemed

to be the general tarust of his queries. I indicated to hin that

Gen @'liara was currently comfing up with estirates based on US

reaction for 2 countries to be selected by him in the Caribbean

area. Each one to have plans for a company size unit and a batti

group size unit. fir. Gilpatric then profased to say at this time

that it was the intent of defens

temporarily played in the leir key that CIA 100 had trouble 11

turring up positive evidence since 1t had been unable to do 8o

to date. ir. Goodiln added that sany allegations had been sade

against Castro but no proof of Cuban asgression had been proven

as yet. He indicated the proof of 1t would be a distinet asset

to us at this time. He then said the US should probe harder for

splitting the leadership 1n Cuba. Raul Castro, for example, 13 a

good possibility. We need a way to set next to this man. Ir.

Goodirin then said that there were overtones throughout the us that

the US was planning an invasion of Cubs, that this vas detrimental

,to our relationships world-wide. Mr. Gilpatric and ir. lenredy

Indicated that no natter what was being done, there would be rumors

to this effect and such overtones would be voiced

about the country

that 1t was possibly because we were nearing the anniversary of the

Burpy Road operation. It. Goodrin said the cuban Revolutionary Cou

regaresentative was in lashington and wanted reassurance that the

US planned Eir .help Cuba. Mr. Goodwin indicated that sympathy for

Cuba 1s gaining ground, •ha mentioned Guaterala and Argentina as

examples there Cubans had succeeded & temporary gain in public

opinion and propaganda. Mr. Kennedy then

asked Mr. vrzirin what

the prospects were for the future and Mr. Goodwin said that the

prospects for the next 2 or 3 years are terrible.

Mr. Goodwin Indicated that one of the items on tonorrow's

agenda for the Special Group would be discussion of tractors for

prisoners in Cuba, Ir. Helms brought out the fact that cambero

of congress had been opposed to this and before anything has done

In regard to speriding US noney in this was, congress must be

checked, since they had expressed a desire to be brought into the

picture before such a project was laid on.

Indicated to castro that they would provide his with tro tractors

Idea 1s the fact that the Communists have taken over the Pavana
