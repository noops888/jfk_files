Mr. Moss Lee Innes,

c/o U.S. Embassy,

Ottawa, Ontario.

Re: Ilando CAPOLINO; Guido CAPOLINO;

Samuel (Sam) MANNARINO.

In our correspondence of 23-Nov-65, para. 7,

mention is made that the CAPOLINOs had issued

a cheque

for $2, 200.00, drawn on a Canadian bank in Toronto.

Subsequent enquiries now indicate that the

CAPOLINOs have an account with the Royal Bank of Canada,

Montreal Branch, Place Ville Marie, Montreal, P.Q, rather

than with a Bank in Toronto.

Enquiries conducted in Montreal indicate that

this bank has a customer's account under name of CAPOLINO,

however, bank officials would not divulge the number of

this account nor the first name of the person who has same.

It was learned, however, that one of the CAPOLINOs had

opened this account with the Royal Bank of Canada prior to

July 1965, with a deposit of $5,406.28.

Bank officials were

reluctant to supply any additional details with regard to

this account, without a court order.

Therefore, under the

circumstances the matter was not pursued further.

4.

Confidential information received from another

source indicates that the account in question may be under

the name of llando CAPULINo and that there have been a large

number of cheques drawn to this account.

The last cheque

known to have been issued by Ilando CAPOLINO was on 10-Dec-65

in the amount of $49.49, payable to Northern Mountain Airlines

Limited in Bol Inquiries indicate that this was cheque

#505 and that the CAPOLINOs have a Current Account with

the Royal Bank in Montreal.
