on 19 Sept 60, but that the effective date had been

changed by Payroll to show 16 Oct 60. Reason for

the chango 1s presumed to be due to LOP. Form 560

shows 225 hours of lop during the walting period..

If those fijuras are correct, then there was no

1.

ful consideration of all the factors involved.

2.

represents the Agency well in his area. His con

servatian is to a degree an asset in New Orleans; it could conceivably
