take a load of

coal to Cuba.

A Greek crewman stated that a Cuban ship located

further up the dock planned to take a large shipment of Soviet

trucks to Cuba. He, Father McFadden, took photographs of these

trucks.

up the wharf. He observed the sugar being loaded into boxcars.

SS "Argentine" he ascertained that several members of a Cuban

ship further up the dock had attempted to make contact with

members of the American crew. of the SS "Argentine" but were

stopped from doing so by the Russion security forces at the

dock.

The above-mentioned photographs taken by Father

McFadden have been made into twelve 35 millimeter
