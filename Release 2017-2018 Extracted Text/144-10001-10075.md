REPORTS REACTION TO KENNEDY'S

25 Nov 63

Priority

Pursuant to my preceding 'telegram (A)) .

- The President's death was given official notice only by the

lowering of a black flag to half-staff at the government head-

quarters and by the visit of a' deputy, minister of Foreign Affairs

and an assistant deputy trade minister to my American colleague.

The people remain distayed, but their anxiety of the first few

hours seems to have died.

The press, on'. the other hand, did

not deviate from its harsh custom Ã¶f. anti-American manifestatior

and sought; with a touch of irritability, to reject any

suggestion of Communist implication in the attempt.

((A)) Not available.
