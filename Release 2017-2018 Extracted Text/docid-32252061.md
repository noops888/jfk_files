On November 18, 1976, information was received by the

Atlanta Field Office that Roland (Bud) Bernard Culligan, JI.

was in possession of information dealing with National

Security. More specifically, Mr. Culligan was alleged to

be in possession of a "hidden journal" relating his past

twenty years

as a CIA agent who had carried out numerous

assassinations for the Agency. It was further alleged that

Mr. Culligan could offer proof as to by whom and why former

President John F. Kennedy was

assassinated in Dallas; and

that there was a danger to President Elect Carter should he

show any dislike toward, or attempt to disband, the Central

Intelligence Agency.

On November 24, 1976, Mr. Culligan was interviewed by agents

of this Service at Leavenworth Prison, Leavenworth, Kansas.

Mr. Culligan claimed to have hidden a journal dealing with

his past twenty years as a CIA agent and assassin, and

requested that he be taken from Leavenworth Prison and

escorted to the hiding place of the journal. Mr. Culligan

refused to turn over a copy of the alleged journal without

being escorted out of Leavenworth Prison to personally pick

up said journal.

Subsequent investigation conducted by this Service has failed

to verify any information provided by Mr. Culligan and no

Culligan has an extensive criminal history dating

back to 1954 with arrests for fraudulent checks, forgery

and uttering, defrauding an innkeeper, bigamy, impersonating

an Army officer, auto theft, misuse of FAA airline transport

license, vagrancy, resisting arrest, worthless check on a

Government reservation, theft by check. Culligan is currently

serving a sentence in Leavenworth (KS) Prison for parole

violation. He was discharged from the USAF in 1951 under

less than

honorable conditions (in lieu of court martial)

for breaking into an officer's club.

According to FBI records,

be a former CIA agent in an attempt to alleviate the conse-

quences for crimes he has committed. CIA has advised this

Service that Culligan has never been employed by them in

any capacity.
