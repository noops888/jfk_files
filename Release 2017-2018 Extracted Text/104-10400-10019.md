The Fresident of the United Stutes di Auerica, John i Ternedy was

assassirated by lee H Oswald iy direct order os the government o1

the Peoples Republic of China. Lee H Oswald executed the act elore

but there ras helpers and reserv. "Now all is over" was password

to his customers. Oswald was a fully convinced Commnist but he

must assassinate Kennedy. We etablised contact with Oswald already

when he was in Sowiet but then to try to get him as a

spy for China.

Later he ras spy for us. When Lee E Osvald had returned fo USA we

conzsureu run anen and iresheied up his minù "you have beed a spy

for us" and told him what could happen to him if FBI got informed.

Sow we had him. He got his last intormation in lexico. /It was not

good to assassinate Kennedy in sexico/ "Fair Play for Cuba" was

started only to confuse and throw the blame on Castro zor the as-

ssassinated. Our government thought that USA should attack Cuba

when Kennedy was mrded as the orginaztion was behind the assassin-

ation. Then Caba was attacked by US: Soviet must helf Castro defend

himself. I: that was so it would burden Sowiet that Oswald had visi-

ted. He should be allieted with Sowiet then we would ask them for A-

bombs and they should not be able to refuse us. "e and Sowiet should

win this wet and whole the world should be Communistic. Then we should

assassinate Krustjer and other Soriet leaders and we would be leader

of the NEY 2. When this letter wiil reach you they have maked

amay with me and all that knowed the planes. This letter is outsmuggled

from our Embassy in Stookholm where the Embassy is achinese spy-shool.

My name is 3y0 Llang Tian. Officer in the department for State-secret.

If you do not bolive this letter explein our hate to use.
