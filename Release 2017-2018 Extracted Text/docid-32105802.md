OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

WASHINGTON 25, D.C.

31 October 1962

FOR THE RECORD

By Brig. Gen. LansdaleSt

Subject: Outline of Covert Operations !

Last night, Deputy Secretary Gilpatric asked me to give him a

brief outline, by this morning, of Operation Mongoose in the light

of current US-USSR negotiations re Cuba. I was to cover present

status of operations, resources, and sketch in future possibilities.

I wrote the outline, based on current reports from the Mongoose

operations team and my staff. Only two copies were typed.

I showed the outline to Mr. Gilpatric this morning as he rode

out to the airport, to catch his flight to New York.. I noted the

exceptional sensitivity of the information in the outline. He acknowl-

edged its sensitivity, said the outline was precisely what he had in

mind, and that I should hold the paper rather than his taking it. He

then asked me to show it to Secretary McNamara and to the Attorney

General. I did so, today.

The outline was read by Mr. Frank Hand, Mra'Bruce Cheever,

and by Lt-Col Patchell. I gave its general information to General

Johnson, Cheever said that the figures were the same he had given

me, for CIA operations; he noted that CIA intelligence reporting

was spotty now, due to lack of mail deliveries from Cuba.
