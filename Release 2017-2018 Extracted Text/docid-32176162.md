CONEINENTAL

Memorandum D. J. Clark

to Mr. Bailey

House Select Committee on Assassinations

FBI Objection: The specificity of the information

tended to compromise FBI sources.

Published Language: Page 589, supra, now states

"...The FBI learned that the July 26 Movement was planning a

raid on Cuba from Texas. In connection with this

raid,

armaments shipments were sent to McKeown. (1704)..."

Note: The substantive objection is removed by the

published language which sets forth the identital wording

recommended by the FBI.

RE ASSASSINATION OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. (MLK)

ITEM (1) :

Original Language: "

...the committee was able only

to review the files of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)...

FBI Objection:

Such language gives rise to the inference

that the HSCA may have obtained RCMP files directly from the

FBI in violation of the rule prohibiting the disclosure of foreign

agency information, absent specific foreign agency authorization.

Published Language: "...the committee was able only to

review the files of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) ,

which were attained by committee subpena from local authorities..."

(Report, page 328, paragraph 4)

Note: The objection is removed by the published

language.

ITEM (2) :

Original Language: "he"Fe conversation with a female

reported

Jerry's response to a

general question concerning

his brother's involvement in the

assassination was:..."

CONTUEINIAL

Memorandum D. J. Clark to Mr. Bailey:

House Select Committee on Assassinations

Published Language: Remains the same as above (Report,

page 441, paragraph 3).

Note: Mr. Blakey declined to modify this statement of

HSCA opinion when the issue was raised with him on 6/15/79.

should also be noted that this objection cannot be construed as

a permissible objection under the MU.

ITEM. (9) :

Original Language: "

...Washington instructed the FBI

legal attache in Ottawa to conduct a similar review of Canadian

passports, with the assistance of the Royal Canadian Mounted

Police. (127) ..."' (%)(W

FBI Objection:

Such language referred to the FBI's

relationship with a foreign intelligence service. (* u

...Washington requested Canadian

records. (127)..."

Note: The objection is removed by the published

language.

ITEM (10) :

Original Language: "...In addition, the panel deter-

mined that the previously unidentified photograph 115, developed

FBI Objection:

The above language is incorrect since

the FBI originally identified photograph 115 as an impression

of Ray's left thumb and, therefore, the HSCA only confirmed this

identification.

Published Version (MLK Appendix, Volume XIII): (1) On

page 116, under photograph 115,

the Q number of 326 is added in

on these te dentification of photograph lis is listed in

"Bookstore"; (2) on page 117, informa-
