Title: JOHN F. KENNEDY RECORDS COLLECTION

ACT OF 1992 (THE ACT)

Synopsis: Kansas City was requested to forward serials to JFK

Task Force.

Enclosures: Enclosed for FBIHQ are 13 original serials.

Details: The enclosed thirteen serials were located on a special

search among the numerous volumes of file 92-116.

The enclosed

original serials were filed with the enclosed charge out dating

back to May of 1966.

The majority of the original serials of 92-116 Sub A

were charged out to FBIHQ on May 9, 1966. Copies of these were

However,

for an unknown

reason, a new 92-116 Sub A file was created for the duplicates.

As a result, two 92-116 Sub A files were in the Kansas City

Office: one

with the forwarded copies; the other with the

retained originals.

627-HB-1019205-3738

The file containing the copied serials

was

correctly

placed in numerical order in closed files.

Unfortunately, as the

file containing the few retained originals was extremely thin, it

was misfiled in another volume of the file.

As a result, when

the initial searches for the missing serials were conducted, the

file containing the copied serials was quickly located, leading

to the assumption that Kansas City no longer had the missing

original serials. Only through the instant complete and

exhaustive search of the entire file were the misplaced original

serials located.
