3/7/65 without the approval of CIA and supposed that CIA

would approve ol the action which he took. (@(4)

ARAGON advised that it was his personal belief that

if anyone paid the total expenses of the trip to washington

an the tines, it 1s possible that MANUELGARCIA DE, was the MY

a wealthy Cuban who has worked with CIA in the past,

individual to whom ESTRADA might have gone for the money (& yU(

MANUEL GARCIA DEL BUSTO, Atlantic lank service:

Greenwich Street, NYC, advised on

7/21/65 that he had not

given ENRIQUE ESTRADA

any money for the trip of Cuban exiles

to Washington, D.C. on 3/7/65, nor had he given ESTRADA $500

to pay the fines for the exiles arrested in Washington, D.C.

on 3/7/65.

The NYO contemplates no further contact with ENRIQUE

ESTRADA on this matter as he has in the past clearly indicated

that he did not want to further discuss this matter.
