Re:

January 15, 1997 Meeting Regarding FBI Compliance

With the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act

Dear Carol:

I write to memorialize the discussions between the Review Board staff Jeremy Gunn,

Ronald Haron, and myself) and Frank Campbell, Joe lazetta, and yourself at our

January 15 meeting.

We have received Director Freeh's letter dated January 13, 1997, designating you as the

FBI's compliance official. We look forward to cooperating with you on this crucial part

of the FBI's work under the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act ("JFK Act"). The

Review Board believes that creating for the public a comprehensive and self-contained

record of how each agency - and especially the FBI - complied with the JFK Act will

greatly further the purposes of that statute.

We discussed the following points at the meeting:

1) Methodology of Records Searches: We unc

ded: We understand a 2 0 7 ant dee?

the FBI's searches both for assassination records and for additional information

or records requested by the ARRB involves searches of general indices at

Headquarters and in each appropriate field office (or Legat). Accordingly, we

request that, to the extent practical, the compliance statement: (a) describe how

each index was searched; (b) explain the purpose and structure of each index

searched (e.g., what types of documents were entered into the index' and what

'For example, to what extent were the following categories of documents

recorded in the searched indices: records handled under "Do Not File" procedures;

records maintained in the office areas of the Director and other high-ranking officials;
