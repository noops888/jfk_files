Estudiantil Universitario) activitles on separate sheets inclusive

his whole career as President FEU.

29 November 1956: Batista's SIM agents picked up Dr. Armando de

Cardenas y Aranguren, a pathologist at University of Havana, and

interrogated him with regard to Cubela and Juan Pedro Carbo Servia,

in connection

with the slaying of Lt. Col. Antonio Blanco Rico of

Servicio de Inteligine a belodotus

SIM (Batista's Security Force). Cardenas admitted that Carbo Servia

had arrived carrying a nachine gun and that he hid both for 4 days.

He also admitted under pressure that he was a homosexual and that

Cubela was his intimate friend. Source: Ours, fron Cuban govern-

ment official. Also reported that Carlos Prio Socarras, former

President of Cuba, had helped Carbo and Cubele to escape from Cuba.

This was reported by Avance (newspaper) on 30 November 1956.

1959: "Raul CASTRO Ruz is a known homosexual, and in 1959 in Raul's

home in the Camp Columbia Hgs, Raul and Cubela were surprieed while

making obvious homosexual advances toward one another. Cubela later

fell into disgrace with the regime.

It is not kuown whether this was

due to his unsatisfactory performance as a student leauer or whether

he had had a "Lover's Quarrel" with Raul. Source: Latin American

revolutionary who lived in Cuba until August 1962 and personally met

high Cuban officials. (Ed Note: Perhaps his performance as one-half

of the honosexual teas was unsatisfactory!!?)

homosexual relations with Cubela during an interrogation by SIl after

the killing of Lt. Col. Antonio BLANCO Rico. However, there is no

doubt that Cardenas still considered himself a friend to Cubela and

as late as 1961 was trying to help get Cubela out of Cuba; this would

hardly be true 1f Cubela had been blackmailing him for jears. There

are other indications that they appear to be good friends. In any case,

this type of blackmail could work both ways - the individusls con-
