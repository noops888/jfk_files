APPENDIX

Details Of Proposed Installation

Pursuant to Bureau instructions to survey all possibilities

for technical coverage on the subject, investigation disclosed

that subject frequents The Pines Motel, 4199 Leechburg Road,

New Kensington, Pa., on two or three evenings each week, usually

during the latter part of the week, where he occupies room-unit

#6 and stays for four to five hours with his paramour-secretary

of many years standing.

Informants advise that his paramour-

secretary handles many' of his affairs; that they themselves

engage in illicit relations; and that he indulges in "sniffing"

cocaine. It is believed that when together in the motel they

converse relative to his racketeering and gambling affairs

as well as the affairs of his associates, including those of

his brother, GABRIEL MANNARINO.

Both the subject and his

brother have

been selected by the Department of Justice as two

of their top "forty" subjects.

Investigation reflects no indication that the owner of this

motel is uncooperative or loyal to the subject. He has advised

that during the previous year he has had several semi-permanent

residents in various units which cause no concern to the subject.

It is proposed that misur coverage be afforded room-unit #6

triea in connection with the Bureau's case

entitled "BERNARD

J. EZHAYA; ET AL. ITSP-MT."

Due to the fact that the location of this motel is approximately

23 wire miles from the Pittsburgh Office control plant and

it would be a major job to provide an additional drop line into

the motel from the existing aerial cable, it is believed that

the monitoring operation at another room-unit in the motel is

the most feasible means and will, of course, afford maximum

security.

The Pines Motel, owned and operated by CLIFFORD HUTCHINSON,

is located at 4199 Leechburg Road, New Kensington, la.

This

orick motel is located on a one acre tract of land facine

Leechburg Road and is set back from the road at an approximate

distance of 200 feet.

three.room-units (Nos. 1, 2 and 3) on the left and three

additional room-units (Nos. 4, 5 and 6) on the right.

The

private livine quarters are occupied by the owner and his wife.

The motel has private business service, telephone numbers

EDison 9-6611 and EDison 9-6612, which

feed into a console

switchboard in his office.

All incoming and outgoing calls

from the room-units are handled through this console as are

individual calls made from one room-unit to another room-unit.

The two drop lines servicing the motel are fed onto the

premises from an aerial cable located

on Leechburg Road.

There

are three telephone poles on the premises supporting the

incoming lines to the motel.

The two drop lines are located

on the last pole, number 961/3, and enter an outside terminal

box located

on the rear exterior wall of the motel where they

are fed into the console.

Individual room-unit connections to

the room-units are egressed into this terminal box from the

console where they are fed by individual beige JKT wire into

the respective room-units.

These individual wires are strung

along the rear wall of the motel under the eave and each

enters a room-unit by way of an individual metal duct where

they emerge individually in a wall box which houses a beige, 42A

block.

The wall box has a face plate concealing the 42A block

and the instrument

cord emerges through this face plate.

It is proposed that

two pair beige JKT wire be used to replace

the existing one pair beige JKT wire egressed from the outside

terminal box to room-units 1 and 6.

In each instance one pair

of

the two existing pairs will be utilized for the respective

instrument's service while the second pair will be bridged and

monitoring will be effected in room-unit #1. The 42A block

in room-unit #6 will be replaced by the Mate unit.

In this

regard the monitoring agent will utilize a suitable pretext

when registering at the motel as an out-of-state salesman.

This installation can be made any day between the hours of

9:00

and 11:30 under full security measures.

Bureau authority is requested to immediately effect this

installation, and to rent room-unit #I at The Pines Motel at the

rate of $35 per week from the date of installation through 1/15/62.

At the conclusion of each night's monitoring operations the

recording equipment will be removed from room-unit #1.
