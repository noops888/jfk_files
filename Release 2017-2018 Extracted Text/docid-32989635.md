Special Agent Joseph E. Battle, currently assigned to the

Washington Field Office, Federal Bureau of Investigation, furnished the

following information:

Approximately two weeks subsequent to the death of former

Director J. Edgar Hoover on 5/2/72, SA Battle accompaniea Robert G.

Kunkel, former Special Agent in Charge of the Washington Field Citice,

to Mr. Hoover's icrmer residence. When they arrived at the residence

they went into the . asement area and obtained approximately eight card-

board boxes which were sealed and which they loaded in a Bureau station-

wagon. This material was then transported to the loading dock at the

rear of the Washington Field Office and he does not know what happened

to the material except that it was picked up by either Kenneth Shaffer,

Assistant Chief Clerk, or Thomas Barden Dudney, Chief Clerk,

Washington Field Office.

He estimated that at least two trips an gussibly three were

made to Mr. Hcover's residence with Mr. Kunkel and on each occasion

approximately eight cardboard boxes were returned to the Washington

Field Office in the manner described above. He believed the above

described events took place over a period of approximately two weeks

and stated that the third trip could possibly have been by himself. He

thought possibly that he may have gotten a radio call while in the Bureau

car to pick up the material to return to Washington Field Office. He does

not know whe'; the cardboard boxes contained and can't recall that he was

ever tola what they contained by Mr. Kunkel.

During the removal of the cardboard boxes from the base-

ment of Mr. Hoover's residence he does not recall ever seeing any file

cabinets locatea in the basement area.

He has no recollection of picking up any material from the

office of Mr. Hoover subsequent to his death for delivery anywhere.

James E. Crawford; 9727 Mt. Piscah, Apartment 604, Silver Spring,

Maryland, telephone mimber 439-3664, furnished the following information:

Crawford was the former chauffeur of Director Hoover. Shortly after

the death of former Associate Director Clyde A. Tolson, Crawford mentioned to

former Assistant to the Director John P. Mohr that he would like to have some card-

board boxes in which to pack pictures. At the time of Mr. Hoover's death there were

numerous pictures in the recreation room of his residence which were later placed in

the attic of the residence. On several occasions he had broken giasses in some of these

pictures and desired the cardboard boxes to store these pictures to prevent this type

of thing from happening. He believes Mir. Mohr contacted someone at FBI Headquarters

and Ralph Windear, employed by the FBI in the Mechanical Section, brought about a

dozen smail cardboard boxes to Mir. Hoover's former residence about two days after

Mir. Tolson died. He utilized about ten of these boxes to store the aforementioned

pictures and these boxes including the pictures are still in the attic. of Mr. Hoover's

residence..

He believes he used three of these cardboard boxes to dispose of old

canned goods and several jars of honey which had turned black. These three boxes

were later pickea up uy the garage cullectors.. He said that Windoor delivered the

empty cartons to the house in a van-type vehicle and that no one else was with Windear.

He has never seen anyone take anything out of Mr. Hoover's former residence and

that he has never done so:

He has heard all kinds of rumors to the effect that files were located in

the house and ever/the garage but that these rumors are without foundation.

June 18, 1975

James E. Crawford, 9727 Mount Piscah, Apartment 604, Silver

Spring, Maryland, was interviewed at the former residence of J. Edgar Hoover by

SA J.E. Henehan and SA Ered B. Griffith, and he furnished the following information:

He has acted as a caretaker for Vr. Hoover's house and took care of

the property at the time of Mr. Hoover's death. He was a former chauffeur for

Mir. Hoover. Since Mr. Hoover's death he has been at the residence on almost a

daily basis. During the period of time immediately after the death he is certain

that a large number of tile cabinets were not brought into the house. Any file

cabinets brought into the house at that time are still present. He asked the inter-

viewing Agents to accompany him to the recreation room and he counted six file

cabinets present which consisted of two 3-drawer, three 2-drawer and one 6-drawer

cabinets.

He pointed out that he believes two of these cabinets belong to Mr. Tolson,

with the other four storing personal papers of Mir. Hoover. Fle is absolutely certain

that 20 file cabinets were not brought to the house from the Justice Building at any

time after the death of Mr. Hoover as he would have had to be aware of same. He

pointer nut that the size of the recreation room was such that 20 file cabinets would

almost fill the room and he could not help but be aware of their presence.

He

airived that he is extremely tired of the continued claims of "secret files" at Mr.

Hoover's house. in the past a claim was made that there were "secret files" in the

garage. The garage is filled with miscellaneous items but there has never been

any files of any kind stored there. In fact, he is not aware of any files ever being

in Mr. Hoover's garage or house except for those items he considered to be Mr. Hoove:

personal papers which, for the most part, are still there.

He I called that he was present in Mir. Hover's house the day that

books were removed from the attic for shipment to Quantico. He believed these

books were boxed and he could not estimate the number of boxes but recalled that

they were shipped to Quantico to the Federal Bureau of Investigation library there.

June 25, 1975

James E. Crawford, 9724 Mt. Piscah, Apartment 604, Silver

Spring, Maryland, was interviewed at the residence of former FBI

Director J. Edgar Hoover and furnished the following information:

He was the chauffeur for Mr. Hoover and also acted as care -

taker at Mr. Hoover's residence. He recalled that he has been at

Mr. Hoover's house on almost a daily basis since Mr. Hoover moved

there in 1942.

Following the death of Mr. Hoover on 5/2/72 he was at the

residence daily. He was present when much of the material was moved

into the house or when anything was moved within the house and it was in

fact his general responsibility to take care of matters at the house. As

such, he was quite familiar with all things that came into the house in

the way of boxes, cabinets, etc., and where that material was located

in the house.

The only file cabinets that were brought into Mr. Hoover's house

after his death were the six file cabinets currently located in the base-

ment of the residence. They consist of two 3-drawer brown cabinets with

, two 2-drawer brown cabinets on top of them in one corner of the

recreation room plus one 2-drawer brown file cabinet and one f-drawer

brown cabinet in what was formerly the bar area of the basement. The

two cabinets in the bar area contain material of Mr. Clyde A. Tolson,

former Associate Director, and the remaining four contain Mr. Hoover's

material. These are the only file cabinets that have been brought to the

house since Mr. Hoover's death. It would have been impossible that

there were 20 to 25 file cabinets stored in the recreation room for any

length of time without his knowledge and there were none.

He does not recall specifically when or how the existing six file

cabinets came into the house but has the recollection that the four cabinets

now containing Hoover material came to the house shortly after Mr.

Hoover's death, that is within several days, and the two file cabinets

now contai ning Mr. Tolson's material came out separately at a later date.

He has a recollection of Ray Smith, a Mechanical Section employee,

being at the house on several occasions subsequent to Mr. Hoover's death

in connection with the movement of material from former Director Hoover's

office to the house. He has no recollection of Smith delivering any filing

cabinets to the residence. He recalls that on one occasion Smith was there

unloading a number of cardboard boxes which were brought into the recrea-

tion room. He believes, but cannot be certain, that Tom reyton, employed

in the Exhibits Section, and a young unidentified white boy whorn he took to

be a messenger helped Smith carry these boxes into the recreation room.

He has no recollection any time subsequent to Mr. Hoover's death

of Miss Helen W. Gandy, Mr. Hoover's Executive Assistant, and two other

white females being in the recreation room. He has no recollection of

Miss Gandy being present and issuing instructions as to where material

being brought into the recreation room should be placed. As pointed out

earlier, the storage of material at the house was his general responsi-

bility and ordinarily he would receive a call from Miss Gandy saying that

material was being delivered to the house with instructions as iu the

general area where this material should be placed.

He recalls that on at least one occasion Clyde Carey, a Bureau

driver, was at the house helping to move boxes from the recreation room

to the attic of the house.. These boxes contained all the photographs and

mementos which had been taken from the walls and elsewhere in the

recreation room immediately after the death of Mr. Hoover to make room

for the other boxes coming out to the house from Mr. Hoover's office.

It is his recollection that Mr. Tolson moved into Mr. Hoover's

residence sometime in June or July, 1972.

following information:

Sometime shortly after the death of J. Edgar Hoover on

5/2/72 he went to Hoover's home in the company of then Special Agent

in Charge Robert G. Kunkel of the Washington Field Office. They

drove in a Bureau car and parked in the alley in the rear of Hoover's

residence. They went to the basement of the residence where he noticed

about 10 to 12 cardboard boxes in a utility room which he said was an

area containing laundry tubs and a washer.. The boxes were about 14"

by 14'' by 14" and were sealed. He believes Miss Helen W. Gandy came

to the door of the utility room and said hello to him. Kunkel went into

the recreation room of the residence but Dowling did not. They took

the boxes described above, placed them in the trunk of the Bureau car,

transported them to the leading dock at the rear of the Washington Field

* Office, where à cierival Empugee took the boses tu an undisclused

location. He does not know what was in the boxes and Kunkel did not

tell him. He does not know what happened to the boxes or their contents.

This was the only occasion subsequent to the death of Mr. Hoover that

he has been at Mr. Hoover's house.

At no time did he narticipate in picking up any boxes in the

office of Mr. Hoover for deliver, elsewhere and he never delivered any

material from Mr. Hoover's of ce to the oifice of Associate Director

Clyde Tolson or Assistant Director - Deputy Associate Director W. Mark

Felt subsequent to Mr. Hoover's death.

Thomas Barden Duaney, currently employed as Chiet Clerk, washington

Field Office, Federal Bureau of Investigation, furnished the following intormation:

. A month or so following former Director Hoover's death on 5/2/72, he

received instructions from Robert G. Kunkel, then Special Agent in Charge,

Washington Field Office, that he, Kunkel, would be picking up some boxes at Mr.

Hoover's former residence and bringing them to the Washington Field Office where

the contents were to be destroyed. He recalled thai during about a two-week period

after being informed of the above by Kunkel, on approximately four or five occasions

Kunkel and SA Joseph Battle delivered sealed cardboard boxes to the loading dock

at the Washington Field Office. On each occasion he or Kenneth Shatfer would meet

Kunkel at the loading dock and take the boxes into the Washington Field Office. As he

recalled on each occasion the boxes were delivered during regular working hours and

on Kunkel's instructions were placed in the vault. Due to the noise of the disintegrator

the material contained in the boxes was destroyed before or after regular working

hours. On one or two occasions he assisted Shaffer in the destruction of the material

and on one or two occasions Shaffer alone destroyed the material. In destroying the

material the contents of tne coxes were piated on a plaiurn and feu grauually into

the disintegrator. He had occasion to look at some of the material which consisted

solely of personal correspondence of former Director Hoover. All of the material

was destroyed.

He estimated that there werea total of four or five cardboard boxes of

this material measured about 14"' by 16" by 10".

He recalls no instance where any material other than that mentioned above

was brought to the Washington Field Office either from Vir. Hoover's former residence

or FBI Headquarters for destruction.

John P. Dunphy, Section Chief,

Exhibits Section, Administrative Division,

was interviewed by Special Agents Robert P. Keehan and Joseph E. Henehan on

6/11/75 and he furnished the following information:

He was Chief of the Exhibits Section on 5/2/72, the day Director Hoover

died, and he assisted in the handling of funeral arrangements at the request of

Assistant to the Director J. P. Mohr. He believes that he was out of his office

most of that week making contacts with the National Presbyterian Church,

Congressional Cemetery and Government agencies. George Cheesman, now retired,

would have relieved Dunphy on his desk.

He knows that employees from his Section went to the Director's Office

to remove items from the office as requested by personnel in the Director's Office.

He is not aware of the movement of anything from the Director's Office to former

Assistant Director - Deputy Associate Director W. Mark Felt's office.

Dunphy presumes that he was told by Tom Peyton or Brent Hughes from

his Section about the plaques and other items of historicai inieresi which were

" removed trom the Director's Office and as he recalls these items were placed in

supply storage at that time and subsequently moved to the Old Post Office Builling

Where these items are presently lorted. The thought was that these items could

be considered for use on the tour reute in the /fBI Building.

He has no knowledge of the removal of files, records or documents from the

Director's Office and while he has Lien to Mr. Hoover's house since his death, he

has never taken any items to the house or removed any i.ems from the house.

On 6/13/75 Mr. Dunphy was telephonically contacted by Special Agent Keehan

and advised that one of the employees believes that Dunphy took some employees to

Mr. Hoover's house in a car in cor, rection with the movement of boxes from the

Director's Office. Dunphy said thai he had no recollection of taking anyone out to

Mr. Hoover's house in a car in connection with any movement of hoxes from the

Director's Office.

He does not know of any inventory listing of items in the boxes of material

presently located in the Old Post Office Building. He checked with Tom Peyton and

Date of transcription.

On 6/12/75 W. Mark Felt, former Acting Associate Director of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation, 3216 Wynford Drive, Fairfax, Virginia,

telephone 573-3216 furnished the following information concerning the movement

of material from the Office of former Director J. Edgar Hoover to Felt's office

subsequent to the death of Roover on 5/2/72:

He believes that sométime shortly after Hoover's death Miss Helen W.

Gandy, who was then Hoover's Executive Assistant, called him and said she was

sending some things to him. She may have said files or material. He does not

recall receiving any instructions regarding the retention of the material or what

to do with it. He had the impression that Miss Gandy was telling him in effect,

"It's your problem now."

It was his impression that it was at least five or six days after Hoover's

death before the material referred to by Miss Gandy was first brought to his office.

He recalled that it came to him in "dribs and drabs." He cannot identify the

individual or individuals who may have brought this material to his office.

Concerning the material described as "official - confidential" files of

Hoover's, Felt recalled the following:

About six or seven days after Hoover died, a young, good-looking white

boy whom he assumed to be from the Director's Office came into Felt's office at

about 6:30 p.m. with a four-wheel "dolly" which had on it an estimated six or seven

cardboard boxes. These were not sealed. The cartons were placed in a closet

back of the desk in the office occupied by then Associate Director Clyde A. Tolson.

He described this closet as "just a little cranny, " triangular in shape. He does

not know the identity of the boy who brought them in and he does not recall whether

anyone besides himself was in the office at that time. He suggested that possibly

Wason Campbell or Bill Soyars may have been there but has no specific recollection

that they were.

Concerning the material in the boxes he said that these were folders with

loose material in the folders. He does not recall any file jackets and said it was

his impression that it was "a bunch of junk." He does not recall any official Bureau

files in this material. He felt that what Miss Gandy had sent to him was "what was

left after she sorted out personal stuff and regular files."

He thinks the material stayed in the closet several days and thereafter

was "spread around" in various existing cabinets in the office. He recalled that

five or six 2-drawer combination safe-type cabinets had been ordered and placed in

Tolson's office. When these cabinets arrived the material was taken from the

cabinets where it had originally-been placed and transferred to the safe-type

cabinets. Approximately two months later these safe-type cabinets were moved

into another room in the suite of ottices. He described this room as the first

room off the reception room to the left. He cannot recall who transferred the

material to these cabinets but believes he may have assisted others in this task.

He never physically reviewed this material but did glance through it.

He could recall seeing a "real old folder" dealing with Eleanor Roosevelt.

Sometime after the arrival of this material Neil Sullivan, a Bureau

supervicer, care over and made a complete inventory of all the material and

he does recall reviewing the completed inventory. He does not think this inventorv

included anything other than the material from Mr. Hoover's Office. Other than

Neil Sullivan he knows of no one who made a systematic review of this material.

He has no recollection of Tom Smith, another Bureau supervisor, reviewing any

of this material but said it was entirely possible that he had.

He does not recall seeing any inventory or list of the material accompanying

this material from the Director's Office.

He has no recollection of removing anything from this material and

sending it elsewhere. He pointed out that he was concerned with the so-called

"secret dossiers" and wanted to maintain all of it so that then Acting Director

I.. Patrick Gray III could review it. In that connection he stated that to his

knowledge Gray did not review this material.

Based on his review of the inventory prepared by Neil Sullivan, he has

no recollection of any folders on Charles W. Bates, Leland V. Boardman or Alex

Rosen. Since these were former or present Bureau officials he feels certain he

would have noted this and probably would have looked at the folders to see what

they contained. He has no recollection of any official files contained in this material

and specifically did not recall seeing anything on Lyndon Johnson or John F. Kennedy.

• He stated that he and his Administrative Assistant Miss Carol Tschudy were the

only two persons with the combination to the file cabinets where this material

was maintained. When specifically asked he said it was possible that the material

had been stored temporily after its arrival in some gray cabinets in his office. That

would be after it was removed from the closet and before it was placed in the safe-

type cabinets. He had a vague recollection of some gray cabinets which were later

turned over to some other office and whoever received them had a problem with the

combination on one of these cabinets.

Other than the material sent to his office from the office of Mr. Hoover

he had the impression that Hoover's "personal papers" were taken to Vir. Hoover's

house after Hoover's death for review by Miss Gandy. He has no personal know -

ledge, however, of anything that went to Vir. Hoover's house and said that Miss

Gandy sent nothing back to him after reviewing this personal correspondence.

On 6/13/75 he telephonically advised as follows:

He is certain that the material contained in the six or seven cardboard

boxes placed in the closet in Mr. Tolson's office was the material from Mr. Hoover's

Oifice.. He recalled that upon the resignation of L. Patrick Gray III, Acting Director

of the FBI, material from Gray's Office was also sent down to Felt; however, this

consisted of no more than two cardboard boxes. He could not specifically recall

whether the Gray material was placed in the closet but said it was quite possible

that it may have been. fle is certain he is not confusing the two incidents.

Annie Fields was interviewed at the former residence of J. Edar

Hoover by SA Joseph I. Henehan and Fred B. Griffith and she furnished the

following information:

She has been employed as the housekeeper for Mr. Hoover since

April 29, 1952, some twenty-three years. She has living quarters in the basement

of the home and was living there at the time of Mr. Hoover's death. She recalled

that she has probably been at the house almost every day during the period immediately

after Mr. Hoover's death and is not aware of any large number of file cabinets

being brought into the house and any file cabinets that were brought in are stll

there. The six file cabinets currently in the basement she believed were brought

in during the period shortly after Mir. Hover's death. These cabinets are still there

and she is not aware of any others.

She would have to be aware of 20 file cabinets

being brought into the basement recreation room as her room is only a short

distance away. At no time did she ever see a large number of file cabinets in the

recreation room. When advised that the cabinets were alleged to have been brought

in through the upstairs kitchen, she advised that this was "impossible." If file

cabinets were brought into the house she would never permit them to be brougni

in through the upstairs as the back basement door would be much more convenient

au wüuld avoid having people track through the kitchen and upstairs hall, This

proves to her that the claim 20 file abinets were brought into the house is without

foundation because they woald wever have been brought in through the upstairs,

in addition to the fact she never saw them.

She had no information of any files being maintained in Mr. Hoover's

house.

Miss Helen W. Gandy, Apartment 915; 4801 Connecticut Avenue,

Northwest, Washington, D. C., telephone number Emerson 2-6909, former

Executive Assistant to then Director J. Edgar Hoover, Federal Bureau of Investigation,

furnished the following information:

There was maintained in the Office of Mr. Hoover certain material

which was referred to as "official - confidential files" or "OC files." At the time of

Mr. Hoover's death Miss Gandy estimated that these OC files comprised about 1 1/2

file drawers. She does not recall when the maintenance of these files commenced but

speculated it was sometime during the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt. She

does not recall Mr. Hoover ever specifically saying why he wanted these files main-

tained in his office but she assumed they were maintained in such fashion for "secrecy"

and explained she meant by this they were maintained in this fashion so that Bureau

personnel would not have unrestricted access to the contents. She pointed out that

these files contained information which if made public might adversely ettect the best

interests of the United States. She pointed out that some of the contents pertained to

high Government officials and if such information was disclosed it might seriously

namper the efevivsess i these officials.

These files were physically maintained by Miss Gandy or in her absence

* by Mrs. Erma Metcali who was also assigned to Mr. Hoover's Office. Mr. Hoover

designated the material to be placed in these files, generally by marking "OC" on the

communications he desired placed therein.

She said these were "not active files" and referred to only on rare

occasions. She knew of no instance where any of the material contained in these

files was used for anything but official purposes. Miss Gandy stated that no Bureau

officials had random access to the OC files and if it was necessary to review these

• files for official purposes Mr. Hoover was notified and if he felt such a review was

necessary, the person desiring to review the files was required to do so in her office.

The material contained in the OC files was indexed. This indices was

maintained by Miss Gandy utilizing 3x5 salmon-colored cards for this purpose and

pertained only to the OC files.

There was no provision made for a periodic review of these files for

destruction of material.

Sometimes copies of communications located elsewhere in official

Bureau files were placed in the OC files if the information in the communications

pertained to the subject of that OC file. This was done so that the information would

be more readily available if needed and time would be saved in locating the material.

Mr. Hoover had told Miss Gandy that the official - confidential files should

ba turned over to whoever was running the Bureau 'when he left."

In addition to the above-described oiticial - confidential files, there

was also maintained in the Office of Mr. Hoover certain regular official Bureau files.

These filled approximately two itle drawers accoraing to Miss Gandy. These files

were also maintained in Mr. Hoover's Office to prevent random access by other FBI

personnel and included the official files on such persons as Lyndon B. Johnson,

Richard M. Nixon and former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.

a sit anno

Iu audition to the above-described files there was also maintained in

Mr. Hoover's Office a large number of personal correspondence files. These files

contained correspondence of a strictly personal naturebeween former Director Hoover

and other individuals and did not contain official Burezu communications. These

personal correspondence files were contained in an estimated 10 - 12 five-drawer

filing cabinets. There wes a separate indices for the personai correspondence files,

also maintained by Miss Candy, utilizing white 3x5 index cards.

Immediately after Mr. Hoover's death Miss Gandy called Mr. JOhn P.

Mohr, then Assistant to the Director, concerning the disposition of the OC files at

which time it was decided they should be moved to the office of W. Mark Felt,

Assistant Director - Deputy Associate Director. She cannot recall specifically but

either she or Mr. Mohr then called Vir. Felt to make the necessary arrangements.

She and Mrs. Erma Metcali then placed the OC files in boxes and they were thereafter

moved to Vir. Felt's office. She recalls this was done either on the day of Mr. Hoover's

death or the day following. She does not recall who physically moved the files to

Mr. Felt's office.

In addition to the oificial - confidential files, Bureau monographs and

bound interesting case write-ups were also moved from Mr. Hoover's Office to Mr.

Felt's office. The index cards relating to the OC files were also sent to Mr. Felt's

office.

Nothing of an official nature, Bureau files or property, was sent to

Mr. Hoover's house or elsewhere outside the Bureau after Mr. Hoover's death. To

emphasize this Miss Gandy said, "Not even his badge."

With regard to Mr. Hoover's personal correspondence files, Miss Gandy

said she had been instructed by Mr. Hoover sometime prior to his death, exact date

not recalled, to start a review and the destruction of these files. As she recalled

approximately one-third of these files had been reviewed and destroyed at the time

of Mr. Hoover's death. Immediately aîter Mr. Hoover's death Miss Gandy assisted

by Virs. Metcalf continued the review and destruction of the personal correspondence

files. Each file was reviewed to insure it contained nothing of an official nature and

the communications were disposed of by placing in the confidential trash and picked

up by the security patrol clerks for ultimate destruction.

Miss Candy's last day at work was 5/12/72. She had not completed the

review and destruction of the personal correspondence files at this time. Mr. Felt

offered to make available to her a room on the fifth floor of the Justice Building where

she could continue her review and destruction of these files. She declined and stated

she preferred to complete this at Mr. Hoover's residence.

The remaining personal

correspondence files estimated by her to consist of seven five-drawer filing cabinets

were then placed in boxes and transported to Mr. Hoover's residence. She does not

recall who handled the move of these files.

Based on written notations on a calendar currently in her possession

Miss Gandy continued her review of these files at Mr. Hoover's residence on 5/13/72

and with the exception of Saturdays and Sundays she worked each day at Mr. Hoover's

house coupleting her review and destruction on 7/14/72. As the material was

reviewed she placed it in cardboard kuses/Jealed these boxes which were subseguently

ricked up by personnel in the Washington Field Office for final destruction.

She also destroyed the

dex cards pertaining to the personal correspon-

dence files.

During her review of these files she found nothing of a official Bureau

nature contained therein. No one assisted her during the review of these files at

Mr. Hoover's home. Mrs. Metcalf "ad assisted her while at Bureau Headquarters but

did not assist at Mr. Hoover's home.:

After Mr. Hoover's death quite a large amount of material was taken to

Mr. Hoover's house which consisted of gifts he had received, gifts he had purchased for

others and various personal memer.os. She does not specifically recall the persons who

packed or moved the personal effects to Mr. Hoover's house.

Each item in Mir. Hoover's house was inventoried by the District of

Columbia Tax Assessor's Office and according to notations made on a calendar in the

possession of Miss Gandy this inventory was conducted on 7/11-13/72.

Miss Helen W. Gandy, Apartment 915, 4801 Connecticut Avenue,

Northwest, Washington, D. C., former Executive Assistant to J. Edgar Hoover,

Director,

Federal Bureau of Investigation, furnished the following information:

The first time she was at the residence of Mr. Hoover after his death

was the day she arrived there to commence reviewing material from his personal

correspondence file which according to records kept by her was on 5/18/72.

At that time the recreation room in the basement of his home contained

two tables, two 4-drawer filing cabinets which contained Mr. Hoover's personal

investment papers and which had previously been maintained in his office in the

Justice Building, and a large number of cardboard boxes.

These boxes contained

a variety of material, mainly the mementos and such that had been packed at his

office and brought to the home. There was one stack of cardboard boxes at the

end of the room in front of the fire place which reached nearly to the ceiling. There

were other such cardboard boxes scattered throughout the recreation room area.

There were no other file cabinets in the recreation room other than the two safe-

type cabinets mentioned above.

In the basement of Hoover's home there was a small area immediately

off the recreation room which was rsed as a bar. In this room she observed when

she first came to the house a number of file cabinets. She could not describe

them but recalled that they were lined up on the back wall which was immediately

adjacent to the maid's room. She cannot recall the number of file cabinets but

indicated in her own apartment the tall which she felt was the same length as the

wall she had reference to in the ba. It was pointed out o her that roughly 6 to 8

file cabinets would fit in the space indicated and she agreed that this was probably

correct. In addition, she recalled that there was one file cabinet located in a

corner just before entry into the recreation room. She could not recall how she

knew this but was of the distinct in pression that these ille cabinets contained material

belonging to Clyde A. Tolson. She based this on the fact thai the material belonging

to Mr. Tolson and Mr. Ecover was carefully segregated in the hoise and it was also

her recollection that she had seen Dorothy Skillman, Tolson's Administrative

Assistant, working on these file cabinets at sometime in Mr. Hoover's home. She

did not go into these tile cabinets to determine their contents as she knew they : were

not Mr. Hoover's.

She knows Raymond Smith and does not recall ever being at Mr. Hoover's

house when Smith was there subsequent to the death of Mr. Hoover. She specifically

has no recollection whatsoever of Smith delivering a large number of file cabinets,

approximately 20 or more, to the recreation room of Mir. Hoover's house. She

is positive there were no other file cabinets in Mr. Hoover's house other than

those she has described above during the time she was at the house.

There was no material including records, files or any other communica-

tions belonging to Mr. Hoover maintained anywhere in FBI space other than his office

suite. She pointed out that there was no dead storage space in any other area for

out-of-date records noting that such out-of-date material in his office was destroyed

when no longer needed.

She knew of no one other than herself who subsequent to Mr. Hoover's

death would have issued any instructions concerning the disposition of material

from Mr. Hoover's Office including instructions regarding delivery of any such

material to his home or anywhere else. The only other females that were ever

• in Mir. Honver's house with her subsequent to his death were Dorothy Skillman

and Annie Fields, Mr, Hoover's maid. Mrs. Skillman came to Mr. Hoover's

house the first time after his death after Mrs. Skillman's retirement on 6/12/72.

At that time Mrs. Skillman utilized the recreation room to work on matters

pertaining to Mr. Tolson's affairs.

mation telephonically:

After further reflection she now believes that she may have

been at the residence of former birector J. Lagar Hoover, Federal

Bureau of Investigation, subsequent to his death on one or two occasions

prior to 5/13/72 which she had earlier stated was the first time she

had been at his residence subsequent to his death.

She said it is her recollection that "when the bank took over

the estate" within a few days after Mr. Hoover's death she met at Mr.

Hoover's home with Mr. Richard E. Brewer and a Mr. Sabitini of the

Riggs National Bank, Mr. Clyde A. Tolson and possibly Mr. J. P.

Mohr. She recalled they sat around the dining room table in Mr.

Hoover's house going uver matters pertaining to Mr. Hoover's estate.

She recalled that it was necessary for her to go down to the recreation

"room and bring up all the "stock folders" which filled one file drawer

in a cabinet in the recreation room. She also recalled that either Annie

Fields or James Crawford obtained Mr. Hoover's jewel box from up-

stairs and the contents of this w re listed by the people from the bank.

She thought the entire procedure took about two hours.

She also now recalls ti it the four file cabinets currently in the

corner of the recreation room * Mr. Hoover's house (two 2-drawer

and two 3-drawer) were those cabinets which she had immediately behind

her desk in her oftice at the Justice Building. At the time the material

was being moved from Mr. Hoover's office to his home she arranged to

have these cabinets together with their contents moved to the house.

These four cabinets contained a personal papers of Mr. Hoover which

required retention for estate purposes. She said that included in the

material were copies of all income tax returns ever filed by Mr. Hoover,

separate folders on each of his stock investments and separate folders

on each of his oil well investra nts.

Albert P. Gunsser, 401 Sligo Avenue, Silver Spring, Maryland, telephone

JU 9-6069, was interviewed by Special Agents Joseph E. Henehan and Fred B.

Griffith and furnished the following information:

He is a former Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

having retired on 6/30/72. In approximately August, 1972, he volunteered to handle

former Associate Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Clyde Tolson's

personal income tax returns and related records. He has been so engaged since

August, 19%z, and except for some vacation trips to florida, normally worked a hali

day every day, Monday 'through Friday, at Mr. Tolson's home which is the jormer

residence of J. Edgar Hoover.

He set up an office in the basement recreation room of Mr. Tolson's house

and at no time has there ever been 20 file cabinets in that room since he began working

there in August, 1972. Any file cabinets brought to the house as far as he knows are

still present and he is not aware of one being moved. There are presently two three-

drawer file cabinets and two two-drawer file cabinets with personal papers including

tax information of Mr.. Hoover and one six-drawer file cabinet and one two-drawer

file cabinet with similar personal papers of Mr. Tolson. There were never any ther

file cabinets present in the house since August, 1972, and the aforementioned six

cabinets are still there.

He is completely familiar with official FBI files and has never been aware

nor has he ever seen any present in Mr. Tolson's house. He feels it would be

utterly impossible for 20 file cabinets to be placed in the recreation room as the

room is too small and is made even smaller by the desk and working area he set up

as well as other desks that were utilized in this room by other individuals. There is

absolutely no foundation to the claim that there were 20 file cabinets in this room or

even to say that there were more file cabinets in the room than are presently on hand.

Robert G. Kunkel furnished the following information:

He is currently the Special Agent in Charge of the Alexandria, Virginia,

Office, Federal Bureau of Investigation. He served as Special Agent in Charge

of the Washington Field Office from August 1, 1970, to October 22, 1972.

Shortly after the death of fir. Hoover on 5/2/72, exact date unrecalled,

he was telephonically contacted by Miss Helen W. Candy, Executive Assistant to

former Director Hoover. She requested him to transport a number of boxes which

she had packed in her office with personal correspondence belonging to Mr. Hoover to

Mr. Hoover's residence. He, accompanied by an Agent from WEO, believed to be

either SA Joseph Battle or SA Joseph Dowling, aid on a few occasions go to her oifice,

picked up the boxes and delivered them to Vir. Hoover's residence. He recalled that

on each occasion they would stop by the Courier Service office at FBI Headquarters,

pick up a four-wheel flat cart to transport the boxes from the office on the fifth floor

to the place where they were loaded into a station wagon assigned to the Washington

Field Office. The boxes were then transported to the residence of Mr. Hoover where

they were taken into the basement entrance and placed in the basement arez. He const

recall if Miss Gandy was at Mr. Hoover's residence each time the boxes were

delivered.

Also at about thiss me time, through arrangements made with Miss Gandy,

sealed boxes were picked up from the basement area of Mr. Hoover's residence which,

according to Miss Gandy, contained the personal correspondence she had reviewed and

discarded. These were taken to the Washington Field Office where they were destroyed

by having the contents of the boxes i 'n through a disintegrator. The individual per-

forming the destruction was Assista. t Chief Clerk Kennel Shaffer. He pointed out

that Miss Gandy was concerned about the discarded correspondence falling into the

hands of individuals who had previously gone through the trash at Mr. Hoover's

residence and to preclude this possibility wanted the discarded correspondence des-

troyed in the method described abov .

He has no personal knowledge of the contents transported to or from the

residence of Mr. Hoover as the contents were sealed.

He has no knowledge whatsoever of any files being moved from the Office of Mr.

Hoover to the office of Assistant Director - Deputy Associate Director W. M. Felt,

or any other place.

Mrs. Erma Metcalf, Administrative Assistant to Director

•Clarence M. Kelley and former Administrative Assistant to J. Edgar

Hoover, Federal Bureau of Investigation, furnished the following

information:

On 5/2/72, the date of Vir. Hoover's death, she was employed

as his Administrative Assistant and was at work in the Director's office.

As part of her duties she took care of the filing and indexing

of' material maintained in the "official - confidential" files. Material

filled about two file drawers. She estimates that she commenced such

duties no sooner than 1965. Prior to that time these files had been

maintained by Miss Helen W. Gandy, Executive Assistant to former

Director Hoover. She described these files as "very inactive" and it

was "very very seldom" that anyone needed anything from these files.

It she received a request for anyone to examine any material in these

ilies she wouid veir the request to Miss Gandy to determine whothor

the request should be granted. She stated that to her knowledge these

files wers never used for other than official purposes.

She started working in the Director's office in 1956 and became

aware that the official confidential files existed in about 1963 when she

was promoted to Administrative Assistant. She does not recall ever

being advised as to the reason these files and folders were maintained

in Mr. Hoover's office but she had always understood that the official-

confidential files were to go into the regular Bureau files "whenever

Mr. Hoover left."

'In addition to the official- confidential files there were about

one or one and one-half file drawers which contained official Bureau

files.

She recalled that Mr. Hoover died on Tuesday, 5/2/72. Shortly

thereafter and she cannot remember specifically, it may have been on

5/2/72 or subsequently during that week she received instructions that

these ofticial-contidential files were to be sent to the oftice of W. Mark

Felt, then Assistant Director - Deputy Associate Director. She does

• not recall who issued those instructions but presumed it would have

been Miss Gandy as she would have been the logical person to do so.

Since it had been her understanding that these files were to go into

the regular Bureau files whenever Mr. Hoover left she assumed that

they were being sent to Mr.. Felt's office so that he would put them into

the regular Bureau files. She recalls that she took the official-confidential

files from the file drawers, put them in cardboard boxes and sent them

to Mr. Felt's office. The boxes were not sealed.

She does not recall who physically transported them to Mr. Felt's

office but felt certain it had to have been someone from the Director's

office. She said that normally one of the clerical employees from the

Director's reception room would have been the person to handle some-

thing like that. She does not think it was handled by anyone outside the

Direcior's uffice. The doscribed the cardboard boxes utilized as about

three feet, by twenty inches, by twelve inches. She has no recollection

of the number of boxes utilized.

She believed that the official - confidential

files,were delivered to Mr. Felt's office by Wednesday of the week of

Mr. Hoover's death and she knows it was definitely within that week.

There was an index for these official confidential files consisting

of three by five cards. It is her recollection, but she cannot be certain,

that these index cards were pulled at a later date and sent to Mr. Felt's

office.

The official Bureau files, previously mentioned, were also sent

to Mr. Felt's office as well as a number of "Bureau monographs that

were scattered through various file drawers" which were also sent to

Mr. Felt's office. She cannot recall whether this material all went down

at one time or whether it was sent on separate occasions.

Nirs. Metcalf was shown a Xerox copy of an eight-page document

captioned, "List of Official-Confidential Files in Director's Office." In

the upper right hand corner of this document are the words "Typed

October 20, 1971." That notation was lined through and handwritten

above it was "4-3-72." She stated that she had prepared this document

and identified the notation "4-3-72" as her handwriting. She cannot

recall specifically why this list was prepared but she does recall going

through the folders in the official-confidential files and typing the

captions of the folders on the list. It was noted that the list was

generally double spaced with the exception of the first page wherein

there was a number of single spaced listings. Specifically, the second

entry is listed as, "Alsop, Joseph Wright, Jr," which is single spaced,

immediately after the first entry and immediately before the third

entry.

She recalled that prior to his death Mr. Hoover had instituted

a review of his personal correspondence files. During his review of the

file pertaining to Joseph Wright Alsop, Jr., he apparently designated

that the material placed therein should be placed in the official -

confidential files; therefore, the folder on Alsop would have been placed

in the official-confidential files. She believes that the original list dated

10/20/71 was probably reviewed by her on 4/3/72 and any folders which

had been added since the original preparation of the list would have

been inserted in proper alphabetical order on the list. She pointed out

that there were a number of single spaced entries on the "B" section of

the list and surmised that Mr. Hoover may have completed a review of

his personal correspondence files through the "Bs" and as in the case

of Alsop indicated that the material on a certain individual should be

inclued in the official-confidential files in which case folders would

have been placed therein which resulted in her adding these to the list

of "Bs" when she checked the list again on 4/3/72. She cannot recall

this specifically but fee's it is a plausible explanation.

It was pointed out to her that the list dated 10/20/71 included

the following captions:

Bates, Charles W.

Boardman, Leland V.

Jaffe, Philip Jacob, was, et al, Espionage - C

Rosen, Al

It was pointed out to her that the above four folders had not been

located during a review of the official-confidential files in early 1975.

She stated that she had no recollection of removing these folders from the

HH 55140 DocId: 32989635 Page 38

## Page 39

official-confidential files and had no information concerning their

absence from the official-confidential files when reviewed in early

1975.

There is a

check mark immediately to the left of each entry on

the above-described list and two check marks to the immediate left of

all entries on the first page and the first six entries on page two. She

does not recall specifically the significance of these check marks but

thinks she may have checked them off as she removed them from the

file drawers when placing them in the boxes to be taken to Mr. Felt's

office. She was unable to explain the significance of the double check

marks on pages one and two.

She thinks, but cannot be sure, that this list was sent with the

official-confidential files to Mr. Felt's office.

Mrs. Erma Metcalf, Administrative Assistant to the Director, Federal

Bureau of Investigation, was shown the contents of a folder captioned 'Index -

Cabinets 1 - 8." She was unable to identify all the material in the folder;

however, she furnished the following information concerning that material with

which she was familiar:

Document captioned "List of Official Confidential Files in Director's

Office" with "Typed October 20, 1971, " in the upper right-hand corner, scratche

through in pencil and penciled above "4/3/72" was originally typed-by her or

10/21/71. She made up this list based on a review she made of the folders in.

Mr. Hoover's Official Confidential files. She believes but cannot be certain that

• when she packed the Official Confidential files in boxes to be sent to the office of

. W. Mark Felt after the death of Mr. Hoover, she may have sent this list to

Mr. Felt with the Official Confidential files. Concerning the penciled date of

4/3/72 Mrs. Metcalf'said it was entirely possible that this should have been

5/3/72 rather than 4/3/72 inasmuch as 5/3/72 would have been the approximate

date she was getting these files ready to go to Vr. Felt. Stapled to this document

is a pink Director's routing slip dated January 21, 1974, which has the following

typed on it: "You wanted to be reminded about the material being held in Mr.

Callanan's office for review. Mr. Callahan's office subsequently located a list

of Official Confidential files turned over to Mr. Felt immediately following

Vir. Hoover's death." Mrs. Metcalf stated she had typed this routing slip and

forwarded it to Mr. Kelley. She recalled that in January, 1974, there was some

inquiry made by the Director conc rning this material and it was her recollection

that Ruth McCord from the Directo«'s Office obtained from Mr. Callahan's office

the original inventory prepared by weil Sullivan describing this material. She

speculated that after Miss McCord's inquiry the list which she had prepared

10/20/71 had come to someone's atiention in Mr. Callahan's office and they in turn

had sent it up to the Director's Oifice for whatever use they might have for it.

The typed paper captioned "Material Turned Over to Mr. Felt, May 5, 1972,"

dated in the upper corner May 5, 1972, was prepared by Mrs. Metcalf. It lists

the material sent to Mir. Felt on May 5, 1972, and included on this list is the

following:

number KE 8-5249, former Assistant to the Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation,

furnished the following information:

Mr. Mohr was on duty at FBI Headquarters on 5/2/72, the date of former

Director Hoover's death. Sometime during that day he had a conversation with Miss

Helen Candy who indicated to him that prior to Vir. Hoover's death Vir. Hoover had

told her to start destroying his personal correspondence files. As he recalled Miss

Gandy indicated she had completed destruction of approximately one-third of these

files at the time of Mr. Hoover's death. Miss Gandy indicated to Mr. Mohr that she

had talked with Clyde A. Tolson, then Associate Director of the FBI, as to whether

she should continue destruction of these files and was informed by Mr. Tolson that

she should continue. Mr. Mohr stated that Miss Gandy subsequently informed him

that when L. Patrick Gray Ill, who had been appointed Acting Director, came through

on a tour of the Director's Office, Miss Gandy told him that she was destroying Mr.

Hoover's personal? correspondence files and that Mr. Gray told her to continue with

that destruction. Miss Gandy told Mr. Mohr that W. Mark Felt, former Assistant

Directos, - Deputy Associate Director hau vifered to make available to Miss Candy «

room on the fifth floor of the Justice Building where she could continue review and

destruction of the personal correspondence files; however, Miss Gandy declined this

offer. He said Miss Gandy preferred to have these files taken out to Mr. Hoover's

house and he thinks arrangements were made whereby personnel from the Mechanical

Section of FBI Headquarters brought these files to Mr. Hoover's house.

He was also

of the impression that Mrs. Erma Metcalf, then assigned to the Director's Office,

assisted Miss Gandy in the review of these files at Mr. Hoover's residence prior to

their destruction.

Mr. Mohr stated that following Mr. Hoover's death a large number of

boxes containing gifts Mr. Hoover had received plus gifts he had purchased to give

to friends were taken from Mr. Hoover's Office to his residence. He had no specific

information as to who transported this material to Mr. Hoover's residence.

Sometime after Mr. Hoover's death, dates not recalled, personnel from

the District of Columbia Tax Assessor's Office came to Mr. Hoover's residence and

in the company of Mir. Mohr inventoried the entire contents of Mr. Hoover's home for

tax purposes. It is his understanding the complete inventory is maintained in the

District of Columbia Tax Assessor's Office.

Mr. Mohr advised he knows of no official - confidential files taken

to Mr. Hoover's house subsequent to his death and stated "there were never any

Bureau files taken to Mr. Hoover's house." He pointed out during the inventory of the

contents of Mr. Hoover's house mentioned above he would have seen such files had

they been there and observed none.

Concerning the official - confidential files maintained in the Office of

Mr. Hoover, Mr. Mohr stated that while he was aware certain files were maintained

by Miss Candy in Mr. Hoover's Office he was not aware of the nature or the contents

of these files with the exception of a file on then President Richard M. Nixon. Mx.

Mohr stated these files were maintained in Mr. Hoover's Office "so that clerks

wouldn't go browsing through them."

At no time did he issue any instructions concerning the disposition of

thése files after Mr. Hoover's death. He recalled a conversation with Miss Gandy

very shortly aiter Mr. Hoover's death wherein she either told him that these files

were being transferred to Mr. Felt's office or asked him if these files should be

transferred to Mr. Felt's office.

In either case, he would have agreed that they

should ba transferred to Mir. Felt's office and it was his understanding that this was

- . done: however, he has no specific recollection as to who performed this function.

As he recalls Miss Gandy indicated that the volume of official - confidential files

which were to be taken to Mr. Felt's office consisted of approximately 1 1/2 file

dkawers. Miss Gandy subsequently told Mr. Mohr that she had also sent to Mr. Felt's

office a number of Bureau monographs together with bound "interesting case" write-ups.

At this point Mir. Mohr observed that prior to Mr. Hoover's death, exact

dates unrecalled, information had been received that former Assistant to the Director

William C. Sullivan had turned over to Robert Mardian of the Justice Department

the files on "17 Wrie House wiretaps" and at that time Mr. Hoover ordered all

Assistant Directors to turn over to Mr. Felt any files maintained by them in their

offices. He recalled that "quite a bit" was turned over to Felt. Mr. Mohr made

this observation by way of explaining that Felt would have had the above-mentioned

files in his office prior to the time the oificial - confidential files were brought to

his office from the office of Mr. Hoover. Mr. Mohr advised that currently there are

two four-drawer filing cabinets at Mir. Hoover's former residence which contain

"mainly investment data." He has gone through this material and there are no Bureau

files or property whatsoever included.

Mr. Mohr was specifically asked if he knew of any files taken from

Mr. Hoover's Office to the apartment of Associate Director Clyde A. Tolson after

Mr. Hoover's death and he stated he had no information whatsoever that such had

occurred.

Approximately two days after the death of Mr. Tolson on 4/12/75

Mr. Mohr stated that James Crawford, former chauffeur for Mr. Hoover, asked

him if he could obtain some cardboard boxes to pack some stuff in at Mr. Hoover's

house. Mr. Iohr recalls contacting someone, identity not recalled, at FBI

Headquarters and made arrangements to have some empty cardboard boxes brought

to Mr. Hoover's house. He recalled that Ralph Windear, a Bureau employee,

subsequently brought some empty boxes to Mr. Hoover's residence and gave them

to James Crawford. Mr. Mohr does not know what Crawford utilized these boxes for

but thinks he may have put trash in them.

Mr. Mohr has no information whatsoever to indicate that any files were

removed from Mir. Hoover's residence subsequent to the death of Clyde Tolson.

Vir. Mohr stated that he has gone through Mr. Tolson's effects since his death and

no official Bureau files are included therein.

following information telephonically:

His first recollection of being at the residence of former FBI

Director J. Edgar Hoover iollowing Hoover's death on 5/2/72 was

around July, 1972, when people from the District of Columbia Tax

Assessor's office were there. He is positive he was not at Mr. Hoover's

residence when oficials from the Riggs National Bank, Washington,

D. C., were there in connection with Mr. Hoover's estate shortly after

Mr. Hoover's death. He does know that someone from the bank was

there shortly after Mr. Hoover's death through conversations he has

had with Miss Helen Gandy, former Executive Assistant to Mr. Hoover.

On this first visit to Mr. Hoover's residence the recreation

room was "over half full of cardboard boxes," which he estimated to

be over 250 in number.

He has no knowledge whatsoever of 20 to 25 file cabinets being

delivered to Mr. Hoover's former residence, does not think that this

could have occurred and has no idea where such a large number of file

cabinets could have originated. He made no arrangements with anyone

to take any file cabinets to Mr. Hoover's residence subsequent to

Mr. Hoover's death.

He has no knowledge of anything being moved out of Vir. Hoover's

former residence subsequent to the death of Mr. Tolson in April, 1975.

F. Thomas Peyton, Visual Information Specialist, Exhibits Section,

Federal Bureau of Investigation, residence 5604 Buckingham Palace Court,

Alexandria, Virginia, telephone 971-5486, furnished the following informa-

tion:

He entered on duty in August, 1945, and was employed in the

Exhibits Section on May 2, 1972, the day Mr. Hoover died. He believes

he received a telephone call from Miss Helen Gandy, Executive Assistant

to former Director Hoover, on May 3, 1972, and was asked to come to

the Director's office. In the Director's oifice he was told by Miss Gandy

that "We have to pack everything." She asked Peyton to have all of the

plaques, pictures, and other items in the Director's office packed. Miss

Gandy packed many of the personal items in boxes and sealed the boxes.

Miss Gandy or Mrs. Metcalf packed the three dimensional items which

were in locked bookcases in the telephone room. Brent Hughes from the

Exhibits Section hanaled the packing of many of the plaques. Miss Gandy

told Brent Hughes and Peyton which items were Bureau property and

could be taken from the Director's office for possible later use by the

Exhibits Section. Peyton believed he could use some of these items in

the new FBI building which was under construction.

Peyton had some of his helpers take the packed boxes from the

Director's office to the loading do ck in the basement of the Justice Building

where they were placed on a truck. He believes he used both a stake-body

truck and a panel truck. The boxes were taken to Mr. Hoover's residence

and placed in the recreation room. The furniture which had been in the

recreation room was moveto the attic of the house.

The movement of boxes from the Director's office took several

days and boxes were piled so high in the recreation room that some of the

boxes that were only three-quarters filled began to collapse and it was

necessary to restack the boxes. He would estimate that the total number

of boxes moved into the recreation room was about one hundred.

Peyton did not pack any files, documents or any other records

in the Director's office and does not know that any such files or records

were taken to the recreation room in Mr. Hoover's house. He believes

Miss Gandy had an inventory and a photograph of the items that were

taken from the Director's office.

The plaques that were packed by Brent Hughes were taken to FBI

storage space at either Taylor Street or the General Accounting Office

Building and these boxes were later moved to the Old Post Office Building

where they are presently located.

Peyton does not recall removing anything from Mr. Hoover's

house after the boxes were delivered there. Mr. Crawford was the care -

taker of the house.

About this same time, Peyton recalls that he was asked by Miss

Gandy or virs. Skiliman to take some boxes irom iir. Toison's uffict.

There were about twenty-five to thirty boxes of items taken from Mr.

Tolson's office to Mr. Hoover's home and these boxes were placed in

an alcove near the stairway.

He has no recollection of moving any filing cabinets to Mr. Hoover's

house or seeing any tile cabinets in the recreation room. The last time he

was at Mr. Hoover's house was shorty after the death of Mr. Hoover and

after the boxes were moved in.

He moved nothing from the Director's office to Mr. Felt's office.

He does recall that Mr. Felt brought in about six - eight 2-drawer, safe-

type cabinets for his office as Peyton had to make a base for these cabinets.

F. Thomas Peyton, Visual Information Specialist, Exhibits

Section, Administrative Division, Federal Bureau of Investigation,

furnished the following information:

He believes the day following former Director J: Edgar Hoover's

death on 5/2/72 he was confacted by Miss Helen W. Gandy, Vir. Hoover's

Executive Assistant, wherein she requested help in packing certain items

in Mr. Hoover's office. Shortly thereafter he met Miss Gandy in the

conference room of the Director's suite. She pointed out items to him

which were to be packed in cardboard boxes. These items could be

described as memorabilia and when asked for examples he said he

recalled a black pearl inlaid pen desk set and ashtray which were on the

large conference table. He did not receive any instructions from her

on how this material was to be packed but believes she did instruct him

to list the contents of each box packed. She then went back to her own

office and he called his office to arrange for personnel to assist in the

packing. Shortly thereafter three or four individuals from the Fishibits

Section came up and the packing commenced.

He cannot recall specific identities of individuals involved; how-

ever, stated that the following forsons, to the best of his recollection,

He recalled that everything in the conference room was packed

• with the exception of 60 to 80 law books that were in bookcases. Personnel

from the library of the FBI Academy at Quantico, Virginia, probably

removed these books and he assumed they went to Quantico.

As the boxes were packed they were taped shut and stacked in

the conference room. In addition to packing material in the conference

room, personnel from the Exhibits Section also packed plaques, certifi-

cates, awards,' etc., which were located on the walls of the hallway

leading from the reception room to the conference room. These personnel

also assisted Mechanical Section personnel in packing material in the

reception room such as trophies, plaques showing the names of Agents

killed in the line of duty and FBI personnel killed during World War II.

They also assisted in packing material maintained in a room adjoining

the telephone room of the Director's suite which consisted of editorials,

newspaper clippings, etc.

Approximately one day after they had commenced parking Miss

Gandy asked him to see if he could arrange to get these boxes out to

Mr. Hoover's house and they then started moving some of the boxes out

to the house while the packing was still in progress. fe is unable to recall

whether personnel from the Exhibits Section or the Mechanical Section or

a combination of both hauled the boxes from the Director's suite to the

truck at the loading dock in the Justice Department Building. He recalls

that they used "whatever trucks the Mechanical Section had" to haul the

boxes and also may have utilized a stationwagon assigned to the Exhibits

Section for hauling. He estimated that three to four trips were made to

Hoover's house over roughly a week's time with the material. He is

unable to recall if there were any times when more than one trip a day

to the house was made.

The first time he was at Hoover's house after 5/2/72 was probably

within the week of Mr. Hoover's death; however, he can't fix the specific

time. He recalled that either. Miss Gandy or Jack Dunpry, the Section

Chief of the Exhibits Section, told him that furniture needed to be moved

out of the recreation room in Hoover's house and into the attic. He does

not recall being told the reason why it was necessary to move this

furniture. He went to the house with three or four employees of the

Mechanical Section and they moved the furniture, including a sofa, matching

chair, possibly a couple of tables and a coffee table from the recreation

room into the attic. He recalled that Miss Annie Fields, Mr. Hoover's

maid, told them where to place the furniture in the attic. He does not

recall that James Crawford, the caretaker at the house, was there. He

has no recollection of moving any caraboard boxes into the attic nor

does he recall whether or not there were any cardboard boxes in the

recreation room at the time. He did remember that the many pictures

which had been on the walls of the recreation room were already removed

from the walls. He has no recollection of any file cabinets being in the

recreation room at this time. He said it is possible they may have taken..

boxes previously packed in the office of Mr. Hoover out with them on

this occasion and placed them in the recreation room; however, he is

not sure of this. He can't be positive but thinks that Ray Smith was among

the Mechanical Section employees at the house on this occasion. He did

not recall seeing Miss Gandy or Mr. Clyde A. Tolson, former Associate

Director.

He has no specific recollection of the sequence of trips out io

the house, hauling material, but recalled that when they started bringing

the poxes into the recreation room they stacked them against the wall which

would have been at the back of t house. They were stacked almost to

the ceiling but he did not think they covered the entire length of the wall.

He believed Miss Gandy had instructed these boxes be placed in that

particular location. He recallt i that they had taken some boxes from

the room in back of the telephore room in the Director's suite which

Miss Gandy had instructed be staded in front of the fireplace in the

recreation room. He recalled these were boxes containing such things

as newspaper clippings and were in boxes larger than the ones normally

used by the Exhibits Section in sacking the material. Inasmuch as the

boxes were heavy they were no completely filled and as a result when

they stacked them tiey had a tendency to sag. He remembers telling

Miss Gandy about this either at the house or in her office and he told

him to continue stacking them in that manner. He remembered that the

next time he went to the house James Crawford told him that these boxes

had tipped over and broken a floor lamp in the recreation room. He

believes that this conversation with Crawford regarding the lamp was the

last time that he was at Mr. Hoover's house in connection with moving

material.

He has a recollection of bringing office supplies out to Miss Gandy

.. at the house at some time but can recall no further specifics in that regard.

He does recall Miss Gandy being present at some time while he

was at the house in connection with moving material into it but cannot

specify when this was.

He has no recollection of participating in the transportation of

any filing cabinets to Mr. Hoover's house; however, he does recall moving.

some "heavy stuff"" other than boxes into the house or of seeing this done.

He has a definite recollection of having to place one filing cabinet on top

of another in the corner of the recreation room. He believes four file

cabinets were involved, two on top of the other two. He does not know

where these file cabinets came from but to the best of his recollection

he did not see them the first time he was in the recreation room after

Mr. Hoover's death. He recalls a conversation with Miss Gandy at the

house regarding these file cabinets. He thinks these file cabinets had

come irom Miss Gandy's office where they hau been chulosed in u wooden

cabinet with sliding doors. It was his recollection Miss Gandy wanted

this wooden cabinet put over the filing cabinets in the same fashion as it

was in her office; however, Peyton determined this was not feasible

because of the manner in which the wooden cabinet was constructed and

secured to the wall. He has a recollection this conversation with Miss

Gandy took place while she was standing on the stairs leading from the

inside of the house to the recreation room.

He said there may have been two other filing cabinets in the bar

area of the basement but he cannot be sure of this.

He is positive that at no time after Mr. Hoover's death did he

observe 20 to 25 file cabinets in the recreation room and the only file

cabinets he recalls are those he has described.

He recalls that in connection with moving stuff into Mr. Hoover's

house he would on some occasions ride out with other personnel in the

truck hauling the material and other times would go out to the house in the

stationwagon accompanied by others and they would meet the truck at

Hoover's house and assist in unloading it.

He recalls Ray Smith being at the house during the moving process

but he can't say when.

The only women he recalls seeing at the house were Miss Gandy

and Miss Annie Fields

In addition to moving Mr. Hoover's effects to his house, he recalls

that during the same period he was told that there was some stuff in

Mr. Tolson's office which was to be taken out to the house. He recalls

going to Mr. Tolson's office where he talked to Tolson's Administrative

Assistant, Mrs. Dorothy Skillman. She asked him if some cardboard

boxes which she pointed out could be taken out to the house. There were

approximately 20 of these boxes in the area of the bookcase opposite the

window in the persinal office of Mr. Tolson. There were another two

or three boxes in the little alcove just off Mrs. Skillman's office. He

made the necessary arrangements to have these boxes moved out to the

house but he does not recall who moved the boxes from Tolson's office.

He does recall being at Hoover's house when they were unloaded and

remembers that they were stacked in a corner of what had been the bar

area in the basement. He specifically recalls that James Crawford was

present at the house at that time. He does not know what these boxes

contained as he recalls they were taped shut. It was his recollection

either Mrs. Skillman or Miss Gandy had told him where these boxes were

to be placed prior to transporting them to the house. He knows of no

file cabinets being moved from Mr. Tolson's office to Hoover's house

or elsewhere.

He did not participate in any manner and has no knowledge of

the packing or moving of the personal effects of Mr. Tolson after Mr.

Tolson's death in 1975.

Other than described above, he has no information regarding

the packing or moving of anything to Vir. Hoover's house or else where .

subsequent to the death of Mr. Hoover.

Kenneth Lee Peffer, Exhibits Specialist - General, Administrative Division,

Federal Bureau of Investigation, home address, Box 294, Berryville, Virginia,

telephone number 703-955-1089, telephonically furnished the following information:

He has been employed by the F'BI since Taruary, 1963, and was employed in

the Exhibits Section on 5/2/72, the day Director Hoover died. He was told by Tom

Peyton, Exhibits Section, to go to the Director's Cifice to pack plaques, pictures

and other personal items. He believed he started this packing the day after Mr.

Hoover died and did this work for about three days. He worked with Melvin Lovelace

and perhaps Larry Massie. He believes Tom Peyton was also present during this

time. Miss Gandy or lom Peyton gave him his instructions as to which items were

to be taken. The items were wrapped in corrugated paper, placed in boxes and the

boxes were sealed with tape. He made a list of the items in each box and taped the

list to the box. Large items were removed to the Exhibits Section, Room B-418,

Justice Building, and crated. Some of the sealed cartons were taken to the loading

dock and placed on a truck to be taken to Mr. Hoover's house. He recalls that about

50 cartons were taken to the house and the cartons were about 12" x 18" x 30%. He

believes he went out to the house twice and on one of these times ho wont with Tomm

Peyton, Ray Smith and Melvin Lovelace. He moved cartons into the basement

recreation room. There were other boxes in the recreation room on his first trip

there and there were possibly as many boxes in the room as he was delivering at

that time. He has not been back to Mr. Hoover's house since that time and has

never removed anything from the house. He did not pack any tiles, records or other

documents and does not know of any such records being removed from the Director's

Office or taken to Mr. Hoover's house. He does not recall moving anything from

Mr. Tolson's office.

Kenneth Lee Peffer, Exhibits Specialist, Ixhibits Section,

Administrative Division, Federal Bureau of Investigation, furnished

the following informaton:

Shortly after the death of former Director J. Edgar Hoover on

5/2/72, he assisted for several days in packing items in the Director's

suite.

At about the time the packing was finally completed he went to

Mr. Hoover's house to assist in moving to the house material which

they had previously packed. He knows he made at least one trip to Mr.

Hoover's house that day and possibly a second trip on the same day.

It is his recollection that on one trip he had helped load the "big blue

truck" with boxes at the Bureau's loading dock prior to going out to the

house. If he made two trips, which seems to be possible, he did not

assist in loading the truck on the second occasion.

He has a recollection of riding in the cab of the truck in the

middle of the seat. He recalls this because he does not like to sit in

the middle and further this was the first occasion he had ridden in the

truck. He is "pretty sure" that Melvain Lovelace, a fellow employee

in the Exhibits section, was also in the truck and is "positive" that

Raymond Smith was the driver. He also is positive that Tom Peyion

was at the house but he cannot recall if Peyton went with them on the

truck or met them at the house.

He recalls that Annie Fields, James Crawford and Miss Helen

Gandy were a the house on this occasion. He can recall Miss Gandy

standing at the foot of the stairs talking to Tom Peyton. It is his recol-

lection that the truck was full but he cannot specifically recall whether

or not there were file cabinets as part of the load. He does know that

he helped unload and move into the louse some file cabinets that day.

He had a specific recollection that while they were packing

material earlier in Mr. Hoover's suite he assisted in placing two "short"

file cabinets onto a "dolly". These cabinets were located in Miss Gandy's

office. Melvain Lovelace was the one helping him and he assumes that

they were taken on the dolly down to the truck and loaded; however, he did

not do this himself. His best recollection was that the file cabinets were

on the truck which he helped load. He recalled that when they got to Mr.

Hoover's house they had a hard time getting the cabinets down the steps

and into the basement because of trouble in getting by a washer and dryer

located immediately behind the basement door. He also recalls having to

Iiit the two file cabinets in order to place them on top of two other file

cabinets in a corner of the recreation.room. He recalls this because when

Tom Peyton told them this had to be done he and Lovelace laughed about

it and one of them said "you've got to be kidding" because it was a very

.: difficult job due to the weight of the cabinets. He does not recall whether

the two cabinets on the bottom were part of the load taken out or whether

they were already in place when they got there. He has no recollection

of any other file cabinets in the recreation room. He recalls there were

cardboard boxes in the room when they got there and he recalls that the

boxes they unloaded from the truck were stacked in the recreation room

almost to the ceiling.

He has a recollection of returning downtown very close to 4:30

p.m. the day he was at Hoover's house. He fixes this time because he

has a recollection of concern that he was going to miss his car pool

which normally leaves at 4:30 p.m. This leads him to believe that he

probably made two trips to the house that day, once in the moring,

possibly returning about noontime and then going out to unload another

load in the afternoon. It is his recollection that he would have ridden in

the truck on both occasions.

He was the only white male actually participating in the unloading

of material from the truck. While Tom Peyton is white he did not

physically participate in the unloading but acted more in a supervisory

capacity.

At that time he knew Raymond Smith only casually since they

were working in different sections and doubted if Smith would have known

him by name.

know who brought this material to the loading platform and has no way of knowing what

the cardboard boxes contained as it is his recollection that there were no markings on

boxes.

He said he may have taken some wooden crates on one of these trips to Mr.

Hoover's former residence but does not know what these crates contained. He was

assisted in transporting this material to Mr. Hoover's former residence by another

ivivchanical Section employee named Raymond Smith. He could not estimate the number

oi car aboara boxes or craies which he delivered iu Mi. Fouver's former residence

Office and placed them in a locked room on the fourth floor. The contents were then

destroyed in a Security Engineered Machine Company Disintegrator. He described

this as a machine which chops paper extremely fine, forces it through a screen

and into a plastic bag. This machine is very noisy and, therefore, it was only

. operated at night.

. seeing old photos of Hoover, postcards, invitations for White House functions, Hoover's

Christmas card list, finarcial statements regarding Hoover's stockholdings, bank

statements, old 'Investigator" magazines and envelopes. Most of the material had

holes punched in it as though it had Len in a bound file and much of the material

was torn in half when he first obsersed it. He never saw inything in this material

that appeared to be from official Bureau files.

He knew that some of this material came from Hoover's house as he had

been told that SA Battle had picked i up from the house. Shater himselt has never

residence of former FBI Director Hoover after his death was on 6/14/72.

She was basing this on the fact that she had retired from her employment

with the FBI on 6/12/72. At that time Mr. Clyde A. Tolson, who had

been the Associate Director of the FBI and for whom she had worked was

then living in Mr. Hoover's residence. She came out there during the

day to help Mr. Tolson with his personal affairs. She worked at a desk

in the recreation room in the basement of the home. Miss Helen W.

Gandy was also at the house working in the recreation room on the

personal affairs of Mr. Hoover.

When she arrived the first time at the house there were orly sir.

filing cabinets in the basement area. These are still there and consist

of two ?-drawer and two 3-drawer brown cabinets which currently con-

tain material bertaining to Mr. Hoover's personal affairs such as old

income tax records and oil well investment data. In addition to these

and separated from them in the basement area are one 2-drawer and

one 6-drawer file cabinet, each brown in color. These are situated in

what was the former bar area of the basement and contain material

pertaining to the personal affairs of Mr. Tolson such as his oil well

investments as well as some office supplies. These latter two cabinets

were at the house in their present location, empty, when she first

arrived there. She had earlier packed the material now contained

therein at the office of Mr. Tolson at FBI Headquarters. This material

had been maintained in file cabinets in his office. It had been taken to

the residence in cardboard boxes and she personally transferred the

material to these two filing cabinets at the residence.

With the exception of the above-described six filing cabinets she

knows of no other cabinets that were brought to Mr. Hoover's residence

after Mr. Hoover's death and is positive she never has seen more than

those six in the basement area of his home..

She recalled that there were no file cabinets maintained in the

office physically occupied by Mr. Tolson at FBI Headquarters. She

stated that her office was immediately outside of his and it was her

recollection she had eight to ten 2-drawer file cabinets, probably gray

in color, in her office. These cabinets contained "all his personal

stuff."

After Mr. Tolson left the FBI she went through this material,

packing some of it in cardboard boxes as mentioned earlier to be

transported to Mr. Hoover's home and some of it was old material

she destroyed in the oifice. She was very specific that there were no

official Bureau documents or other material included in that which she

destroyed or which was moved to Mr. Hoover's home. She was also

specific in recalling that the eight to ten 2-drawer file cabinets were

left in their normal location after she had emptied the contents and when

cho loft the FBI.

She has no knowledge as to where the six filing cabinets currently

maintained in the basement area of Mr. Hoover's home originated or who

brought them to the residence.

Raymond Smith, 4936 Nasa Street, Apartment 10, Washington, D. C.,

telephone 398-5665, was interviewed by Special Agents Joseph E. Henehan and

Fred B. Griffith and furnished the following information:

He has been employed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for 17

years and is currently employed as a mechanic at the FBI Academy, Quantico,

Virginia.

At the time of the death of J. Edgar Hoover, he was employed as a

driver in the Mechanical Section of the Administrative Division. He arove.....

the big blue stake body truck. Shortly after the death of Mr. Hoover, he would

estimate to be probably "a couple days" after the death, he made two trips to

the Director's home from the Justice Building carrying 20 or more file cabinets

to Mr. Hoover's house. As he recalls his truck was loaded when he arrived

in the morning and he opened the truck up and noticed that it was almost filled

with four or five-drawer brown metal file cabinets. He went in and advised the

"front office" of the Mechanical Section that he would need help with the load

as he couid noi move tue ile vavinets uy himself. He does not recall to whom

he spoke but he seems to recall that he was told there would be help at Mr.

Hoover's house to unload the truck.

He thereaiter drove the truck to Mr.

Hoover's house and unloaded the file cabinets into the basement recreation

room. He made two trips each beginning the first thing in the morning with

his truck being loaded by someone else the prior evening. He recalled that on

one occasion at Mr. Hoover's house Miss Gandy, MI. Hoover's former

Executive Assistant, was present: nd she told him to line the file cabinets up

against one wall in the recreation.com.

He believes that Miss Holines, who was formerly employed in the

'Director's Office, may also have been there on one of the occasions when he

brought the file cabinets but he wa. not sure. During the period after Mr.

Hoover's death he made at least four or five trips carrying materials from

the Justice Building to the house. 'He moved boxes, plaques and ther

miscellaneous items and it was his understanding that all the items moved

were the personal belongings of Mr. Hoover.

During the same period he also worked several days at Mr. Hoover's

• house moving various items about the house and assisting in the assembly of

materials being brought in.

Mr. James Crawford supervised his activities for the work he per-

formed in Mr. Hoover's house moving various pieces of furniture and items

brought to the house. He has no recollection of ever moving any materials

out of Mr. Hoover's home anywhere and he has not been at Mr. Hoover's

house in the immediate past nor since Mr. Tolson's death. He has no recol-

lection of moving any materials from Mr. Hoover's office to the office of the

former Assistant Director - Deputy Associate Director W. Mark Felt.

Mr. Smith was reinterviewed on 6/12 by SAs Joseph E. Henehan and

Fred B. Griffith and furnished the following information:

He recalls that he did move approximately 20 file cabinets which were

brown four or five-drawer letter size from the Justice Building to Mr. Hoover's

house., He hãs no idea where thest the cabinets câmc trum aũ thay vert luauc

onto his truck by someone else. As he previously stated, the truck was already

loaded when he reported to work in the morning by unknown individuals and he

was instructed to drive the truck and unload it at Mr. Hoover's house. He made

two trips with the file cabinets on two different days, both of these trips being

the first trip he made on each day. He used a stevedore device to roll the file

cabinets into Mr. Hoover's house.

He recalled that he had help at the house

in getting the file cabinets down to the recreation room but he is unable to

recall who helped him. He knows it was not the laborers who worked with him

in the Mechanical Section of the Administrative Division. He recalled that he

went in the back door of the house up through the kitchen down the hallway and

down the basement stairs with each of the estimated 20 file cabinets. He

recalled that when he first went into the recreation room with the first cabinet

he was surprised as everything had been removed from the walls which made

the room look quite different than it had been in the past with the numerous

personal items which had been on the walls. The file cabinets were heavy and he

had difficulty moving them down the basement steps and he had assistance

but does not recall who helped him. He received instructions from Miss Gandy

as to where to line the cabinets up and he lined them up in a lineup against the

wall, in the front part of the room whereas the cardboard boxes being stored

were

stacked in the back of the room.

He recalled during this same time there were one or two safe-type

two-drawer file cabinets that he assisted in putting on stands in the recreation

room, which stands were similar to those made by the Exhibits Section of

the FBI. When the file cabinets were all in the recreation room they were

aligned side by side along the side wall.

He was unable to recall who told him to take the truck to Mr.

Hoover's house with the cabinets but it must have been either of his bosses

Mr. Marsden, Mr. Gregory ör Mr. Brennan.

In addition to the file cabinets he made other trips to Mr. Hoover's

house carrying sealed boxes and other materials. He recalled that on one

trip that Jessie Petersen was with him.

He is not aware of any specific items he moved as he did not look

in the file cabinets and recalls no markings on them and most other items

delivered were in sealed boxes.

He stated that his memory is a little "fuzzy" and the aforementioned

is as best as he can rochil. No adviced ho does not think he has confused

the above with any other assignments when he may have moved items to

Vr. Hoover's home or other locations. He could not recall any specific

individual who was involved with the movement of the aforementioned cabinets.

Raymond Smith, 4936 Nasa Street, Apartment 10, Washington, D. C.,

employed as a mechanic at the FBI Academy, Quantico, Virginia, furnished the

following information:

In May, 1972, he was employed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation

as a driver assigned to the Mechancal section. He ordinarily drove a Bureau ford

trucks, blue in color, with a completely enclosed body.

One or'two days after the death of J. Edgar Hoover on 5/2/72, Smith

reported for work as usual at approximately 8:00 a.m. He observed that the blue

truck appeared to be "sitting low" indicating that it was loaded. Since he had left

the truck the previous evening unloaded, he investigated and found that the truck was

fully loaded with file cabinets. As he had no prior information as to what was to be

done with the load, he contacted someone in a supervisory capacity to ascertain

what was to be done with them. He could not recall who he contacted but said it

had to be either Anthony Codi, his immediate superior, or Bob Marsden, Supervisor,

Mechanical Section. He recalled being instructed by either Codi or Varsden to

drive the truck to Mr. Hocver's former residence where someone would meet

him to help him unload the truck. Usually in situations such as this personnel from

the Mechanical Section would assist him in loading and unloading. He drove the

truck to the house and parked in the driveway along side the house. He was

assisted in the unloading by two young white males who he did not know. They took the

file cabinets from the back of the truck and carried them down the steps into the

recreation roon where they were placed along the wall at the front of the room.

He recalls there were cardboard i ixes between the file cabinets and the wall. He

said Miss Helen W. Gandy, Mr. E over's Executive As-istant, was there and told

him where to put the cabinets.

He described these cabinets as brown, legal-size, 4- or 5-drawer. Ele

recalled that when he was unloadit, one of the cabinets it nearly tipped over on

him and a drawer came open. He observed this drawer was filled with what

appeared to him to be folders, light in color, each roughly one irch in thickness.

He was of the opinion that all of the cabinets were filled inasmuch as they were very

heavy.

He could not specifically recall the number of cabinets but said they

completely filled the truck.

He recalled that in addition to Miss Gandy there were two white women

present at the house whom he did not know plus several other persons also unknown

to him.

He believes that on the following day he drove the same truck to Mr.

Hoover's former residence and is of the opinion that he delivered some additional

file cabinets as well as some cardboard boxes. He did not recall receiving any

specific instructions regarding this trip but recalls he was again assisted in

unloading the cabinets at Mr. Hoover's former residence by two white males;.

however, he could not be sure they were the same individuals who assisted

him on the previous trip. He was unable to specify the number of file cabinets

delivered on the second occasion; however, he estimated he delivered a total

of 20 to 25 cabinets.

He also recalled a subsequent trip to Mr. Hoover's house when he

and Jesse Peterson, Mechanical Section employee, delivered two safe-type

file cabinets and put them in the recreation room of Mir. Hoover's house. It

was his recollection that on that occasion he observed in the recreation room

some of the cabinets he had delivered earlier.

The last occasion, approximately a week later, which would be somewhere

between one an' two weeks since Mr. Hoover's death, he was again at Mir. Hoover's

residence assisting in moving carchoard boxes from the recreation room to

the attic of the house. On that oce sion he did not observe any of the 20 to 25

file cabinets he had delivered earlier. He has no inforniation as to where these

cabinets went and he personally did not move any cabinets out of Mr. Hoover's

house.

He said as far as he kne 7 there was no written record regarding the

trips made to Mr. Hoover's residence.

During the period 1961 or 1962 she was a substitute in the Office of former

Director J. E. Hoover but could furnish no information concerning any official -

confidential files which may have been maintained in Mr. Hoover's Office.during

that period. She recalled that someone mentioned the fact that a file was maintained

that there would be some file cabinets coming to his office and indicated that Miss

Helen W. Gandy had told him some material would be coming: to his office from

former Director Hoover's Office. She cannot recall specifically when this was;

The Xerox copy of a single sheet of paper bearing the handwritten

notations captioned "Section I"' is familiar to her and the handwriting thereon

in ink and pencil is hers; however, she cannot recall way she had it or what

it pertained to.

The two lists, one numerical by file number and the other alphabetical,

captioned "Index of Material, Cabinets 1- 6, Mr. Felt's Oitice" were prepared

at her request by Neil Sullivan who had previously inventoried this material.

These were all official Bureau files that were serialized and quite often someone

from the Files and Co'nmunications Division would call her asking for a certain

file number so that they could review material in those files. It was difficult

to readily locate the proper file so she asked Neil Sullivan to prepare the lists.

She thought this was probably done several months after he made the original

inventory. She also noted that as other files were added the additional data was

typed onto the existing lists.

He has been employed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for ten years

and is currently an Exhibits Specialist.

Shortly after the death of J. Edgar Hoover he worked for two days in Mr.

Hoover's suite constructing packing boxes and sealing boxes that had been packed.

During the sealing of boxes he did not notice any files being packed. As he recalls

most of the boxes that he sealed contained hard bound books.

There were various

other memento-type items packed but he was unable to recall any documents or papers

being packed. He also assisted in carrying boxes down to the loading platform and

subsequently did load some on the large blue FBI truck.

He was working for Brent Hughes who was the Supervisor in charge during

this perioa.

He recalled that within approximately to weeks of Mr. Hoover's death,

exact date unknown, he went to Mir. Hoover's house and assisted in unloading one

truckload of sealed boxes which he carried to the basement recreation room.

He recalls seeing two file cabinets in the basement at that time and is completely

certain that there were not a large number of file cabinets in the basement recreation

room.

The day after he unloaded the boxes he went to the house again for the purpose

of straightening up the basement recreation room. His work consisted of stacking

boxes neatly and higher to create more floor space. At that time he is certain there

were no more than two file cabinets in the room.

He has never assisted in moving any material from Mir. Hoover's house and

has not been to Vir. Hoover's house since approximately two weeks after Vir. Hoover's

death.

He has no information with regard to any FBI files being at Vir. Hoover's

house.

Melvian Lovelace, Exhibits Specialist, Exhibits Section,

Administrative Division, Federal Bureau of Investigation, furnished

the following information:

Shortly after the death of former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover

on 5/2/72 he assisted in packing material in Mr. Hoover's suite for

approximately two days. Also assisting in this packing were Bob Banworth

and Bud O'laver, fellow employees in the Exhibits Section. He was

involved mostly in making up cardboard boxes in which to pack the

material; however, he does recall packing some mementos and hard

bound books.

About the time the packing was completed he recalls assisting

in loading the cardboard boxes on flat-bed trucks with wheels, taking

these trucks to the loading platform in the Justice Building, Where he

assisted in loading the cardboard boxes on the "big blue truck." He

cannot be sure but he believes Raymond Smith assisted in loading the

truck.

It is his recollection that he was at the residence of former

Director Hoover on two occasions to assist in unloading material

previously packed in Mr. Hoover's office. On the first trip it is his

recollection that he rode in the big blue truck with Tom Peyton,

Kenneth Peifer and Raymond Smith who was the driver. He recalls

unloading boxes from the truck into the recreation room of the house.

On the second trip to Mr. Hoover's house he recalls riding in

a Bureau stationwagon assigned to his section which was driven by Tom

Peyton and Kenneth Peffer may also have ridden in the stationwagon on

this occasion. He does not recall whether the "big blue truck" was at

Mr. Hoover's residence when they arrived or arrived later and he does

not recall the reason for going out in the stationwagon instead of the

truck. It is his recollection that the truck driver on this occasion was

either Raymond Smith or Jesse Peterson. He recalls that on this

occasion there were four 2-drawer file cabinets, brown in color, on

the truck. He did not assist in loading these file cabinets on the truck and

does not know who performed this function. It is his recollection that the

truck was parked in the alley and the file cabinets were taken through the

door of the basement and placed in the recreation room. It is his recol-

lection that these file cabinets were moved with a stevedore and he recalled

they had some trouble getting the cabinets down the steps and through the

basement door. He has no knowledge as to what was in the cabinets, if

a his steven enoving hese abiles to the recreation oct o kenne

Peffer and either Raymond Smith or Jesse Peterson. He can't recall

exactly where these cabinets were placed in the recreation area but has

a clear recollection that two cabinets were placed on top of two other

cabinets.

He recalls there were many cardboard boxes in the recreation

room on both occasions; however, he observed no file cabinets except

the ones he helped unload.

On one occasion he saw Annie Fields at the house but cannot be

sure as to whether he also saw James Crawford.

The above are the only two occasions he was ever at Mr. Hoover's

former residence.

At no time was he ever at the apartment of former Associate

Director Clyde A. Tolson and at no time did he assist in moving any

material from Mr. Tolson's office to former Director Hoover's house.

He entered on duty February 8, 1948, and was assigned to the

Exhibits Section on May 2, 1972, the day former Director Hoover died.

He was asked to pack items in the room occupied by Miss Nancy

Edward F. Ryan, 3925 Oliver Street, Hyattsville, Maryland, telephone

927-1455, was interviewed by SA Joseph E. Henehan and furnished the following

information:

He has been employed by the FBI for 24 years and is currently a

Supervisory Exhibits Specialist.

Shortly after J. Edgar Hoover's death he was called upon by his boss,

Brent Hughes, to assist in moving everything from the inner hall walls in Mr. Hoover's

suite. The items he removed and packed were plaques, photos and various other

souvenir-type items which were placed in boxes, the boxes marked, numbered and

sealed, He described his role as being just one of many workers assisting in clearing

and packing items contained in Vir. Hoover's suite.

He believes that Brent Hughes and Tom Peyton were "sort of in charge"

with regard to clearing Mr. Hoover's suite and he is not aware of any files,

correspondence or other paper work being packed. He was unable to furnish an

estimate as to how many people were working in the office suite at that time but

there was constant traffic moving in and out. He believes that most of the material

they wrapped was shipped to the storage warehouse on Taylor Street.

He recalled that he has made about two trips to Vir. Hoover's house.

On

both of these trips he went by stationwagon carrying sealed boxes, the exact number

unrecalled, which were placed in the basement recreation room.

These trips were

made with Tom Peyton and Ken Peffer. He recalled that the boxes they were carrying

were placed in the basement recreation room which room he considered to be very

"cluttered. " He did not see any file cabinets in the basement recreation room.

He has no information whatsoever of any files going or coming from Mr.

Hoover's house or office and he hal nothing to do with the moving of any material from

Mr. Hoover's Office to the office of former Assistant Director - Deputy Associate

Director W. Mark Felt.

He recalled that he had been called upon on various times to hang various

items on the walls of the Director's suite and based on this work he would estimate that

probably Miss Gandy, the former Director's Executive Assistant, had probably ten

Raymond H, Schaeffer, Visual Information Specialist, Exhibits Section,

Administrative Division, Federal Bureau of Investigation, furnished the following

information:

He entered on duty in February, 1947, and was assigned to the Exhibits

Section on May 2, 1912, the day former Director Hoover died. He recalls thal

he went to the Director's office to pick up boxes about two to three days after

Mr. Hoover's death. The boxes were already packed and sealed and he delivered

these boxes to Mr. Hoover's house. He recalls that he made about three trips

to Mir. Hoover's house and probably mat about one trip each day. He went to

the house with Tom Peyton, Exhibits Section, on two or three occasions, and

with Bud O'Haver on one occasion. Peyton was overseeing the movement of the

boxes.

Schaeffer believes that the boxes were loaded into a station wagon each

time he went to Mr. Hoover's house. He took about 15 boxes on each trip. The

boxes were carried into the recreation room at the house and he was assisted

there by Mr. Crawiord, the caretaker. Miss Fields, the maid, and Miss Helen

Gandy were also at the house when the boxes were moved in.

He never moved any filing cabinets and he does not recall seeing any

cabinets in the recreation room. He never saw the contents of any boxes.

The boxes were staked along three walls in the recreation room, perhaps

two-three rows deep in some places and he would estimate there were 60-75

boxes in the room at the time of his last trip.

He never packed, saw, or removed any flles, documents or other records

from the Director's office and never removed anything from Mr. Hoover's house.

He has not been back to Mir. Hoover's house since his last trip with the boxes.

He never moved anything from Mr. Tolson's office.

FoLlowing Is an account, based on my recollection

of my assignment, dealing with files described as "official

confidential" of former Director John Edgar Hoover.

In late May or early June, 1972, I was instructed

by Section Chief William A. Branigan to report to the office

of then Deputy Associate Director F. Mark Felt. Upon

reporting to Mr. Felt's office he personally showed me six

2-drawer safe-type cabinets then located in his office.

He said basically he wanted a catalog or inventory made

oi these cabinets. He proceeded to show me that of the

six cabinets two

cabinets contained material which belonged

to him in his official capacity and related to various

confidential projects

and operations of the Bureau.

remaining four cabinets he described as coming from former

Director John Edgar Hoover's office and although he wished

a catalog of all six cabinets he was primarily concerned

with the material that had come to him from Mr. Hoover's

office.

He stated he did not know what the contents of

the cabinets were and wished to have a brief description

of the files, reports, correspondence, etc., contained

therein.

I immediately began reviewing this material.

Several days were spent in boconing acquainted with the

general characteristics of the data contained in the

cabinets in order to decide the best method of cataloging

this material.

It was quickly apparent that these files

were a combination or amalgamation of a number of sets of

files which had been accumulated by a number of Bureau

officials. This description could be quickly discerned

since the

: file cabinets contained individual alphabetical

sets of files.

It is my recollection that there were

three

such sets of alphabetical folders.

I then decided to make a master alphabetical

list of each file folder contained in these cabinets

together with an indiviaualized inventory or catalog of

each individual drawer. Cabinets 1 and 2 were done

Immediately since they were current material of Mr. Felt,

The remaining material was reviewed and as I would

become

acquainted and familiar with the contents of a drawer I

would then dictate to a stenographer the contents of that

drawer.

Two copies of this were made - original and one

carbon. The original table of contents or inventory of

each drawer was thereafter placed in the front of that

drawer appropriately labeled.

The carbon copy was used

by me personally to prepare the subsequent complete

alphabetical listing of all the material in these cabinets.

It was thereafter destroyed by me.

Proceeding Irom cabinet to cabinet the entire

project took three weeks. Ihe notes taken by the steno

graphers were returned to me and destroyed togethes with

the ribbons on the

•typewriters. At the conclusion of the

project one original

copy of the master list was provided

Mr. Felt and one master copy of each drawer's contents

placed in that drawer.

No other copies were kept or

maintained of these items.

No files, no folders, and no individual leces of

mail were removed or destroyed

during this inventory.

One-

half sheet letter on White House stationery from former

President Roosevelt to Director Hoover was removed and

furnished to Section Chief Thomas i. Smith of the Research

Section, Intelligence Division.

The purpose of this was

that this document was concerned with authorizing the FBI

to conduct investigations dealing with subversive activity.

Its date or exact wording I cannot recall. It was given

to Mr. Smith since he was engaged in the preparation of a

project at the request of then Acting Director I. Patrick

Gray, III, dealing with basic authority of the FBI to be

engaged in investigations dealing with internal security.

There were two additional 5-drawer safe-type

cabinets that apparently also had been removed from Mr.

Hoover's office.

These two cabinets did not contain files

but rather contained monograhs, briefs, looseleaf notebooks

of various investigative matters and summary case vrite-ups.

For example, there was a summary write-up on the Lindbergh

kidnapping,

a brief on the death of John Dillinger and

several others. This material was returned to the division

in which it originated. Some of it was sent to the library

at Quantico for future research, Office of Legal Counsel

but the great majority of the monograms dealing with the

various aspects of the Bureau's responsibilities and juris-

diction in the field of internal security were handed to

the Research Section of the Intelligence Division for

disposition. A great majority of this material was

classified from confidential to top secret. An inventory

of these monograms, briefs, etc., was made and maintained

in the cabinets mentioned above.

As far as I know, no one else went into these

cabinets and files/folders, certainly, no one went into

nem while I was present.

The stenographers were Patricia

Dana and Deborah

Stone, both then assigned to the

Intelligence Division.

Each did a portion of this inventory,

Memo to Mr. Nichols

PURPOSE:

July 3, 1956:

You requested that we ascertain whether the Burear was at any

time under the direct supervision of anyone other than the Attorney General.

DETAILS:

As a result of the lands frauds investigations of 1906-190%, Attorney

General Charles Bonaparte is said to have conferred at the White Flouse with

President Theodore Roosevelt who directed Bonaparte to create an investigative

service within the Department of Justice which would report to no one except

the Attorney General. (66-1723-49).

On July 26, 1908, Attorney General Bonaparte issued an order which

created the Bureau of Investigation. The Chief Examiner (Head of Bureau) was

to report directly to the Attorney General. (66-1723-9)

The AG's Annual Report for 1919 states that on June 30, 1919,

Attorney General A.. Mitchell Palmer directed that the Bureau of Investigation

be placed under the direct supervision of the Attorney General's office.

Pending such time as an assistant attorney general should be appointed to

undertake this duty, Mr. John T. Creighton was designated to supervise the Bureau.

The Annual Report of the AG for 1920 contains a "Functional Chart

of the Department of Justice" which shows the Division of Investigation as

being under the supervision of the Assistant Attorney General of the Division

of Miscellaneous Matters.

On November 19, 1921, AG Daugherty issued an order designating Rush

L. Holland as Administrative Assistant Attorney General in charge of all

administrative matters. Among the divisions specified to report to Mr. Holland

was the Bureau of Investigation. (66-1723-9)

The Annual Reports of the Attorney General for 1922 and 1924 state

that the Assistant Attorney General in charge of administration exercises, by

order of the Attorney General, supervision over all major administrative units

of the department, including the Bureau of Investigation. The 1925 Annual Report

sets out the report of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of administration

and states that the reports of the bureaus follows thereafter. One of the bureaus

reporting in this group was the Bureau of Investigation.

Memo to Mir. Nichols

July 3, 1956

ti

• Per to

In a Departmental memorandum of November 5, 1929, entitled

"Memorandum Setting Forth the Duties and Functions of the Director of

the Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice" it is stated

that the Director is solely responsible to the AG for decisions as to

law and procedure involved in the conduct of investigations by the

Bureau in the same manner as are the various Assistant Attorneys

General of the Department in their respective Divisions. (Justice File 44-3-11)

In accordance with the general reorganization of the Government in

1933, AG Cummings promulgated Departmental Order #2507;, dated December 30,

1933.

Schedule A, on page 3, states that the Administrative Division under

Assistant to the AG William Stanley is to handle general administration, including

supervision of the Division of Investigation.

Order of the AG #250%, Supplement 10, dated November 27, 1941,

States that eftective immediately the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the

Bureau of Prisons will be under the direct supervision of the AG. Matters of

policy and Departmental procedure shall be handled by the Directors of these two

Bureaus directly with the Office of the AG.

During the early years of the Bureau, Special Agents of the Bureau

in many instances functioned under the direct supervision of Departmental, rather

than Bureau, officials. (66-1723-9) In 1926, in a memorandum to Colonel

William 3. Donovan of the Department, Director Hoover stated that agents and

accountants working on the so-called Senator Wheeler case were not under the

control or supervision of the Bureau, but had been working under the supervision

of Special Assistant to the AG Pratt. Mr. Hoover stated that it was only after

several months subsequent to his assuming the position of Director that he was

able to have orders issued to enable him to know the whereabouts of these agents

and accountants. (62-7903-518) On August 5, 1924, instructions were issued by

Mr. Hoover to the effect that Antitrust Agents and Bank Accountants should report

to the Special Agents in Charge upon their arrival in a field district and keep in

communication with them although not necessarily operating under the individual

jurisdiction of said Special Agents in Charge. These emplayees had apparently

been operating out of Washington for some years past in accordance with their

own inclinations and those of some Special Assistant or other Departmental official

(66-1723-9) It is to be noted that Departmental Order 3732, Supplement 66, dated

December 30, 1952, provides "On the operations of the Bureau of Investigation as

a whole, the Director of the Bureau is to be directly responsible to the Attorney

General, "

OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

Washingion, D. C.

December 30, 1952

ORDER NO. 3732

Supplement No. 66

TO ALL OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE:

It appears that the Bureau of levestigation has from time to

time been placed under the supervision of various Assistant Attorneys

General, who have been directly charged with its operations. At the

same time practically all of the Assistant Attorneys General, as well

as other officers of this and other Departments, request the Bureau of

Investigation to make investigations of matters assigned particularly

to them.

In the investigation of cases assigned to a particular Assistant

Attorney General, it, of course, is to be understood that this is a mat-

ter between the particular Assistant Attorney General and the Director

of the Bureau of Investigation and that the Director of the Bureau of

Investigation will report on that individual case or subject to the par-

ticular Assistant Altorney General, On the operations of the Bureau

of Investigation as a whole, the Director of the Bureau is to be direct-

ly responsible to the Altorney General.

Very truly yours,

James P. McGranery

Attorney General

WENORANDIL FOR

TOISON

FAMI

I am very nuch concerned

over the flood of nenorando

that haue come through to me

in the last two

i addressed

to the Attorney General. As you know, it has been my desire

to try to hove the bureau report directly to the Attorney

General rother then is the basistont to the Attorney General,

and the present Attorney General has indicated a javorable inclina-

cion along this liner Howevers I on very fearful that he bill son

act unfavorably if we continue to sand to hin indiscriminately

menorando upon all kinds of material me things thai he would lagit

inately have no interest in and upon unich he could not and should

BOt

p0336

I do wont to keep him informed upon matters that are of

RatiOnal

interest ond motters in which he might be personally inter

ested.

I do want to have him poss upon the real natters of aajor

pallay, but so is harmful to the effort unich I an mating to be sene-

no to him a lot of triolet routine material that ought to be x707g

mitted for cotion to other branches of the Department or ought to de

octed. upon by us directly

It is inperative that the assistonts to

the Director personally reuiew all mail addressad to the Attornay

General for my signature so that they might determine whether it is o

proper matter io bring to his attention. The fact thet we are now

sending meterial to the attorney General doesn't mean that we must

discontinue sending all material to the office of the assistont to the

Attorney Genercia

There are many netters that legitinately fall

within the jurisdiction of that office, such as selective Seroice

would be puzzled es to what he should do with it and would necesserily

have to in turr refer it to the office of the assistant to the attorney

General.

With such e routine of material going to the Attorney

GeBeral,

I am fearful that he will becone desperate and throw up his

hands and seel sone sort of a filter through which Bureau material

con flow. Certainly, Imuld do so if I vere in his position receiving

the flood of immaterial memorando that have been going to his for the

Jasi too weeks.

There must be more discernment and judgment exercised

in this matter+

very truly yours

MEMORANDUM FOR THE DIRECTOR

Mr. flarbo

Tole. Room

On August 14, 1941, I talked to Acting Attorney

Tour Room

General

Biddle about the

matter of having the Bureau

Mr.: Noaso

report direct to the Attorney General rather than to

The Assistant

to the Attorney General.

I told lêr. Bidale

Mr. Tracy

Miss Seahm

that you felt very strongly about this matter and wanted

Miss fandy

me to discuss the matter with him at this time because the

Departmental picture was changing so rapidly that you

thought it most desirable to have any change that was going

to be made, mode at this time.

I pointed out to him that

it was your earnest recommendation that the FBI report

direct to the Attorney General because so many of the

matters being handled by the Bureau now were of such a

delicate nature, originating as they did in other depart

ments,

in the mhite House, etc., that the reports thereon

should be forwarded direct to the Attorney General and not

to some other Departmental official.

It was pointed out to Mr. Biddle that for practical

purposes there was at this time a vacancy in the office of

The assistant to the Attorney. General.

Is a change is to

be made in the bureau's reporting direct to the Attorney

General it should be made at this time when there is no

The Assistant to the Attorney General will not feel thot

there is any personality or personal element involved in

the change.

I told ir. Biddle that you had no feeling for

or against any person who was being considered or might be

considered for the office of The assistant to the Attorney

Generai, but that as a matter of fact,

in the interest of

efficiency you believed that the best interests of the

Department would be served if the Bureau reported direct

to the attorney General and not through an intermediary.

Mr. Biddle stated that Mr. MoGuire hud talked to him

about this and he believed the procedure recommended by you

WaS 27

entirely correct and proper

one: He expressed the

that it would be improper for him to take

Jact that action taben by him might not be in accord with the

views of desires of the new attorney General. He repeated that

he was entirely sympathetie to your proposal and that he would

candidate for the position of Assistant Attorney General is

Registration for a limited time.

Apparently considerable opposition is anticipated

to HARRISON'S being named to this point, probably from the

White House. The White House is desirous of seeing LEO

SUBJECT: FOREIGN OPERATIONS - LEGAL ATTACHE OFFICES (LEGAT) Miss Gandy

PURPOSE: To summarize views of Bureau officials and set forth recommendations

of Inspection Division relative to retention of l7 existing Legats,

recommend opening of 6 more, and reopen Resident Agency in Mexico.

BACKGROUND: Prior to December, 1970, we operated Il Legat Offices (B ern,

Bonn, Buenos Aires, Hong Kong, London, Madrid, Mexico City,

Ottawa, Paris, Rome and Tokyo). In September, 1970, the President in conversation

With the Director requested that we expand our foreign operations because of the

President's desire for better intelligence. The President also discussed this with .

the Secretary of State who advised that he thought it was a good idea. As a result,

6 additional offices were opened in the latter part of December, 1970 (Beirut, Caracas,

Copenhagen, La Paz, Managua and Tel Aviv). These were opened based on the opinion

of the President and Dr. Kissinger that our Legats were furnishing highly valuable

l information of interest to the White House.

On the basis of our productivity in obtaining high-level information, the

President again requested (May, 1971) the Director to consider further foreign office

expansion. In response to this, at Director's request Domestic Intelligence Division

(DID) recommended reopening our offices in Manila, Rio de Janeiro and Santo Domingo

and opening new offices at Canberra, Kuala Lumpur and New Delht, DID also

recommended adding one Agent to each of 5 existing offices -- Beirut, Caracas, London

Madrid and Tokyo

Mr. Sullivan had approved of the 6 additional Legats opened in December, 1970,

and, in fact, personally initiated the recommendation of one of them (Beirut), He had

not previously expressed opposition to the expansion of oux foreign liaison operations,

but in a memorandum 6/7/71 Mr. Sullivan expressed the strong opinion that the

proposed addition of Agent personnel abroad and reopening or opening of new offices

should not be accomplished as he felt that many of our Legats were not furnishing

intorination ana services sutriciently valuable to justity their retention. In his memor -

andum 6/16/11 Mr. Sullivan recommended our offices at Bern, Buenos Aires, Hong Kong

Madrid and Tokyo should be closed. With regard to Beirut, Caracas, Copenhagen,

La 222,

Sullivan said he seriously doubted the value of these offices and recommended they,

Memo for Mr. Tolson

Re: Foreign Operations - Legats

be permitted to operate for months and then analyzed thoroughly to determine ti

they were worth the money being spent; if not, all of them should be closed. He

completely opposed further expansion and opening offices in Manila, Rio de Janeiro

Santo Domingo, Canberra, Kuala Lumpur and New Delhi.

INSPECTION DIVISION EVALUATION:

Based on the divergence of opinion the Director ordered immediate inspections

of all existing Legats. These inspections have been completed and separate memoranda

have

gone forward justifying the retention of all 17 existing offices. Retention has been

based primarily on our success in obtaining high-level items of interest to the White

House. As of 8/3/7i, 52L items had been submitted to the Bureau by these offices,

of which 295 had been disseminated_to the White. House. Numerous favorable

comments have been received from the White House. In each instance the Director

concurred with recommendations that the 17 existing offices be continued.

It had been suggested by the DID that our coverage could be stepped up by,

increasing our complement in Beirut, Caracas,

London, Madrid and Tokyo.

AS a

resilt of our inspection an additional Agent was recommended for London and this

was approved. It is also felt that the Resident Agency formerly at Hermosille,

Mexico, should be reopened to cover a vast region now handled as a road trip.

should be staffed by personnel already assigned to our Mexico City Office. Addition

of personnel to other Legat Offices is not recommended,

odisitss+2+45230777

As indicated, it was recommended that offices be opened in Canberra

Lumow, Manila, New Delhi, Rio de Janeiro and Santo Domingo. Based on the destres

of the White House for additional high-level intelligence and our past successes

in this area, it is felt that we shoula advise the President that we are ready to

go forward with this expansion, if that is still his desire, at any time he wishes.

QUOTA OF FBI EMPLOYEES ON FOREIGN ASSIGNMENT:

Our quota of personnel on foreign assignment authorized by State Department

is 88.

When it was approved that we add I Agent to London, it was decided to move

an Agent from Buenos Aires to London to stay within our quota. Subsequently;

James A. Miller was removed as Legat at Managua, and it was recommended and

approved that Managua operate with only l man until the full potential of that office

could be determined. Thus we presently have 87 employees on foreign assignment,

I under our quota. As we may have to replace. Agent in Buenos Aires or Managua, we

Should not reduce our quota.

In its recommendation of 5/28/71 for expansion of Legat operations, DID

recommended staffing the 6 proposed offices as follows:

While this staffing appears to be reasonable, in view of the present concern

for economy and the balance of payments problem, it would appear preferable to

start each of these offices with only one Agent and one clerk. Thus, we would be

increasing the number of Bureau employees on foreign assignment by 12 rather than

20, and doing not that which is desirable but that which is essential.

The opening of the proposed 6 offices with one Agent and one clerk each would

increase our present

quota

of personnel on foreign assignment from 88to 100.

This would be presented to Stäte Department for its approval after discussion

with the President and/or Dr. Kissinger.

Pursuant to your instructions, there are set forth below my

observations concerning and evaluation of our foreign liaison operations.

Over-all, I consider our foreign operations to be productive and

of value. Aside from statistical accomplishments which are from time to

time reported by memorandum, there are a number of very valuable

by-products arising as a result of our foreign operations which assist the

Bureau materially in discharging its domestic responsibilities and in,

maintaining its outstanding status throughout the world in the law enforce-

ment and intelligence areas.

In the past year, while I have been directly associated with the

foreign liaison program, I have had the opportunity to meet a number of

high-level officials of foreign police and security agencies who have called

at the Bureau. Without exception, they have been highly complimentary

of the Bureau and the Director's administration of it. By having Agents

located strategically in foreign countries, we are able to convey a true picture

of the Bureau's jurisdiction and efficiency. The men who man our foreign

posts obviously are quite attentive in discharging their responsibilities in

this regard. They are also fostering a spirit of cooperation in the law.

enforcement area. by seeking and securing cooperation of the organizations.

abroad which are in the best position to pursue necessary leads in both the

criminal and security areas of the Bureau's work. Conversely, they assist

these cooperating agencies when their own domestic interests require investiga-

tion within the U. S. Our cases under the classification of Foreign Police,

Cooperation run into the thousands each year,, Last year the actual number

attin sulta taus 3354-94679059

was 3217. We receive full value for this cooperative gesture by reason of

the vastly greater number of requests we send abroad for handling by

these foreign agencies.

Another area in which our men abroad render valuable service

not only to the Bureau but to the Government as a whole regards the travels

of dignitaries. Whenever the President, Vice President or high-level U. S.

Re: FOREIGN LIAISON OPERATIONS

official,

as well as friends of the Bureau, go to areas where we have Legal

Attache (Legat) posts, our men have performed outstanding services not only

in providing information relating to security of these individuals but in

assisting them in connection with many complex problems which arise during

foreign travel.

I have observed during the past year a number of very fine comments

which have been made by U.S. Ambassadors abroad regarding the assistance.

which has been rendered by our Legats and how valuable it is to have these men

assigned to Embassies. I have in mind particularly some comments which were

made by U. S. Ambassadors Lodge in Buenos Aires and Hill in Madrid.

From an operational standpoint, it is clear to me that having men

abroad is of material assistance to the Bureau. In those areas where we do not

have coverage by Legats we must rely upon Central Intelligence Agency to cover

leads in security-type cases and upon State Department to pursue leads in

criminal matters. variably, those agencies take weeks and at times months

to ser responses, whereas our men operate on the same basis as our Agents

in this country, affording close attention to the matters and tollowing other

agencies to see that responses are forthcoming within reasonable time limitations.

To my mind, this is probably one of the most important functions which our

men perform abroad.

Without question, officials on the highest level in our own Government

recognize the value of having FBi personnel in selected areas.. In this regard,

I recall the situation in 1965 when President Johnson felt that the communists

were about to seize control in the Dominican Republic and requested the

Director to send Agents in to help combat the situation. The outcome certainly

demonstrates the success that we achieved. Again, just a few months ago,

the Director was asked to assign two Bureau Agents to Saigon on what appeared

to be a permanent basis to help straighten out a mess which had developed there.

The Director sent down our Legat from Tokyo, who, in a very short period, was

able to determine that there was nothing there which would require the full-time

services of two Bureau Agents.

Perhaps the most outstanding example of the President's reliance

upon the Director and the ability of the FBI to produce when called upon to do

so is that outlined in the Director's memorandum of 7/21/11 when he cited

in depth the basis for our expansion abroad last December. This was for the.

purpose of producing high-level intelligence needed by the President and I feel,

that the fact that since that time our Legats have submitted over 200 items which

Kissinger as well as to the Attorney General speaks

for itself. Hach of these items was reviewed very carefully by desk men

here at the Seat of Government, taking into consideration intelligence

produced by Central Intelligence Agency, State Department and the military

agencies, and in each instance it was clear that the material was of sufficient

importance to send it over to Dr. Kissinger.. The value of it has been.

commented upon by Dr. Kissinger both personally to the Director and by

letters.

It the Director instructs us to undertake a further expansion of

our foreign operations principally for the purpose of producing high-level

intelligence, I have every confidence that we can be as successful in the new

areas that we enter as we have been in the areas now covered. Since

expansion for foreign intelligence production purposes has been into areas

where the Bureau does not have a need in connection with its domestic

operations, we should, of course, follow the progress of any such expansion

offices very closely to be certain that their production of intelligence warrants

their continuance.

DETAILS

BACKGROUND.

Following the Bureau's apprizal of the Department of a possible

violation of Public Law 670 (Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 709) by "Friends of

the FBI' in distributing a fund raising letter, the Department requested by memo

of 8-27-71, that interviews be conduated with Luis Kutner, Lee Edwards, Patrick J.

Gorman, and Efrem Zimbalist,: Jr., to attain specific answers to a number of

pertinent questions.

The Bureau instructed the Chicago, Los Angeles, and Washington

Field Oifices, to promptly conduct the requested interviews and the results are.

attached. Copies of the interview results, suitable for dissemination, are also

attached to a proposed transmittal memo to the Department.

INTERVIEW WITH LUIS KUTNER

In summary, Chicago's interview with Luis Kutner, attorney and

chairman of the Commission for International Due Process of Law, reflects his

claiming that Gorman and Edwards are responsible for forming the "Friends''

and they approached him in Washington to join in refuting attacks on the FBI, using

his tax-exempt Commission as sponsor. Original agreement provided Gorman

would handle fund solicitation and Kutner claims solicitation letter bearing

Zimbalist's signature sole product of Edwards and Gorman and distributed without

Kutner's approval. Kutner states he enlisted aid of J. Walter Thompson Advertising

Agency to help campaign but when Edwards and Gorman disputed strategy, Thompson's

firm withdrew leaving fund-raising to Edwards and Gorman. Initial plan was to raise

funds for study to show FBI achievement with estimated costs over $100, 000 over

expenses. Kutner claims difficulty from outset with Edwards and Gorman regarding

fund collection records, having never received a verified audit of receipts and

expenses. Kutner states Edwards advised him that as of approximately 8-27-71,

"Friends" had approximately $400, 000 in donations and that $90, 000 of the first

$96, 000 collected was spent by Edwards and Gorman for expenses.

Kutner questioned

Gorman's Washington banking procedures and states association began deteriorating

alter tirst solicitacion letter malled without his approval and he noted greed of Gormat

who he felt was financing his entire firm from "Friends" expenses. Kitner states

Edwards and Gorman also admitted not fully complying with laws covering operation

of fund raising campaign. • Kutner states his Commission has not received "one thin

dirne" from the campaign and he was additionally displeased with manner Edwards

saw Zimbalist alone regarding honorary chairman/and-finally terminated the

association bacause "fraud was indicated." On 7-22-71, he agreed with Edwards and

Gorman to terminate Commission support effective 8-31-71, and on 8-18-71, he

"complained to Internal Revenue Service regarding activities of Edwards and

Gorman,

also advising postal authorities his Commission's name was not authorized for future

mailings. Copies of supporting documents are attached and are also being forwarded

to the Department.

INTERVIEW WITH PATRICK J. GORMAN

Washington Field Office advises of interview on 9-7-11, of

ratricks. Gorman, who stated adwards suggested forming "Friends" prompting a

subsequent meeting with Kutner to further discuss formation of organization. Gorman

in D.:C. on 7-27-71.

As of interview date, Gorman said two accouts existed in

a D. C. bank, one with a balance of $97, 000 and the other with approximately

$200, 000. Gorman said that as a professional fund raiser he received a fer of $1, 50

per month for three months and sub-contracted actual physical solicitation to another

firm. Gorman stated he was also reimbursed over $100, 000 for expenditures for

such items as envelopes, letters, and printing. He stated Internal Revenue Service

had recently audited expenditures,fees and bank accounts. Gorman offered the opinion

that Kutner withdrew Commission support under pressure from more liberal member

of his organization. Lee Edwards declined on 9-8-71, to be interviewed without the

presence of his attorney and no interview was conducted with him.

INTERVIEW WITH EFREM ZIMBALIST, JR.

Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., advised interviewing Agent on 9-9-71, that he

was unexpectedly visited briefly at the Warner Brothers Studio, Burbank, California,

in Nay, 1971, by Lee Edwards, whom he had previously met, and who explained the

formation of a group to support the FBI with a particular need for prominent people

to speak out in support of the Director and prepare and distribute written material to

news media as well as preparing video and audio tapes for radio and TV promotion.

Limbalist agreed to help in making audio and video tapes, as necessary, once the

organization was tully operational (none were ever made by Zimbalist), in response

to Edwards' request, Zimbalist agreed to serve as honorary National Chairman, with

no specific duties or responsibilities, and signed a general statement regarding

the goals of the organization. Zimbalist has no recollection, however, of authorizing

Edwards to use his name or signature in connection with fund-raising drives and was

shocked to discover his signature on fund raising circular letters. Zimbalist feels

Edwards lifted his signature from the statement he signed and he later telephonically

informed Edwards of how disturbed he was over the use of his name without

permission and that his attorneys were writing Edwards requesting removal of his

name from the letterhead and all future endeavors of the group. Edwards apologized,

stating he thought Zimbalist had granted permission to use his name any way he thoug

fit, including fund raising. Zimbalist agreed to Edwards' request not to speak out

-publicly to avoid adversely affecting the "Friends" and Edwards informed him that

as a result of the campaign over $300, 000 had been collected and was deposited in a

Chicago bank. Also, according to Edwards, as a result or.. a difierence over money

planned to move the "Friends" from Chicago to Washingion, purportedly. due to

Kutner's demand for $15, 000 per month for the "Friends" to operate under the

tax-exempt status of the Commission. Edwards told Zimbalist he planned tó

apply for tax-exempt status in D. C., and he hoped to turn collected funds over

to the Herbert Hoover Foundation to conduct research work for the "Friends"

Il this could not be done, Edwards reportedly said, all monies would be returned

to contributors, less money spent for expenses. Edwards told Zimbalist he had

taken a $7, 500 fee from collected funds, as had Gorman for the direct mailing"

Zimbalist stated Edwards made no claim that "'Friends'was approved

MEMORANDUM FOR THE DIRECTOR:

RE: W. C. SULLIVAN

After reviewing Sullivan's latest memorandum on our foreign

operations, it appears more definite to me that he is more on the side

of CIA, State Department and Military Intelligence agencies, than the

FBI.

There has to be something wrong for him to do such an

abrupt about face at this time, after agreeing with what we have done

in the past and now being unalterably opposed to any further expansion,

as desired by the President and Dr. Kissinger.

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. SULLIVAN

I have given very careful consideration to your memoranda of

June 7; 1971, and June 16, 1971, together with the memorandum of

Vir. Wannall of May 27, 1971, which was initialled by you; Mr. Wannall's

memorandum oi May 28, 1971, initialled by you; my leter to the eresident

dated september 21, 1970, initialled by you; your memorandum of

September 22, 1970; Mr. Brennan's memorandum of September 21, 1970,

initialled by you; and also Mr. Child's memorandum of May 23, 1969,

analyzing the work and the accomplishments of our various foreign liaison

offices and the problems incident thereto, together with the recommendations

of Messrs. Dalbey, Felt, and Beaver upon the recommendation made in your

memorandum of June 7, 1971, suggesting the closing down of a number of

the foreign liaison offices, some of them recently established last December

with your approval.

First and foremost, I want to clarify a point you have raised in

your memoranda, namely that our foreign liaison offices, with the exception

of Mexico City, are not operational and that we cannot develop "hard, high

quality, positive intelligence by sending men to these countries only in a

liaison capacity." We do not have the legal right to establish any foreign

offices on an operationalbasis. The law specifically limits foreign intelli

gence operations to coverage by the CIA; and, therefore, we have known

all along that our offices in foreign countries could not be in an operational

status:

I cannot agree that establishing liaison offices in foreign countries

without being operational prevents us from developing hard, high quality,

and positive intelligence. Certainly in all memoranda prior to: your memo-

randum of June 7, 1971, you did not indicate any such reservation and, in

fact, you specifically initialled the memorandum of Vr. Brennan addressed

Memorandum for Vir. ' Sullivan

July 21, 1971

to you under date of September 21, 1970, upon which I predicated my letter

to the President of September 21, 1970. At that time I believed that by

reason of your approval of the various memoranda dealing with the foreign

liaison operations, you were in accord with the procedures which the Bureau

had followed and, in fact, approved the establishment of additional liaison

offices which I listed in my letter to the President of September 21, 1970,

and which I indicated was predicated upon Mr. Brennan's memorandum of

September 21, 1970.

I want to also point out that at no time, either in September or

more recently, did I ever suggest to the President the idea that we should

expand our foreign liaison operations. It was the President's idea expressed

to me in september, 191, that such expansion should take place, and, as

a result thereof, I submitted my letter to him of September 21, 1970.

The

President I know in my presence directed Mr. Faldeman to present my

• letter to the President to the Secretary of State for prompt and immediate

concurrence. Several months passed, and it was not until December, 1970,

that Dr. Kissinger inquired of me as to what had happened to the expansion

of our foreign liaison which the President had approved being expanded in

September, 1970. When I told Dr. Kissinger that this matter had been

delayed in the State Department and that I had been awaiting word for approval

of the same by the Secretary of State, Dr. Kissinger stated he would personally

take this matter up with the President and that I would receive in a few days

the State Department's approval of the expansion of our foreign liaison.

Several days later in December, 1970, I received a telephone call from

Secretary of State Rogers stating that the President had spoken to him about

the expansion of our foreign liaison operations and that he was in full accord

with the same with the exception of the opening of an office at Helsinki in

view of the pending negotiations to be carried on there by representatives

of the Russian Government and the United States Government concerning

the limitation of arms. As I have previously indicated in my memorandum

to you, I concurred with the suggestion of the Secretary of State and countered

with the recommendation that instead of opening an office at Helsinki, we open

an office at Copenhagen, with which the Secretary agreed.

I heard nothing more about the expansion of foreign liaison from the

President or Dr. Kissinger until June, 1971, when in a conference with the

-2

HH 55140 DocId: 32989635 Page 155

## Page 156

Memorandum for Vr. Sullivan

July 21, 1971

President; he expressed his desire that we again expand our foreign liaison

in view of the valuable information which had been procured by the Bureau in

its operations abroad. I indicated to the President that I would confer with

Dr. Kissinger when he would be avallable about this matter as to ootain any

suggestions he might have. In the interim, the President left for San Clemente,

California; and Dc. Kissinger left on a worldwide trip and both of them have

just returned within the last few days from San Clemente, California.

I outlined the preceding to give you a chronological picture of what

has taken place in this field. I do not understand the somewhat sudden change

in your attitude to the value and importance of our foreign liaison operations

in view of your concurrence of its expansion in December, 1970, and the

various memorada of Mr. Brennan and Mr. Wannall, who are in direct

contact with the operations of the foreign liaison situation.

Therefore, in view of the what I consider objective review by

Messrs. Felt, Dalbey, and Beaver together with the many letters and oral

expressions from Dr: Kissinger as to the value of our foreign liaison program,

I cannot agree with your memorandum of June 7, 1971.

This morning I received another memorandum from you transmitting

a memorandum of Vir. Wannall upon the statistical accomplishments in the

foreign liaison program in which you reach the conclusion that by juggling

statistics, you can prove almost anything. I do not share this view, though

I do think that statistics alone do not always prove or disprove a particular

situation.:

I have personally over the years reviewed all of the material which

we have transmitted to Dr. Kissinger and much of the material which we have

transmitted to the State Department and other Government agencies concerning

our foreign liaison program, and I believe that we have made, as expressed

by the President and Dr. Kissinger, a very valuable contribution to the necessary

knowledge of the President and Dr. Kissinger in the foreign field. This has

been accomplished without 'operational" functions, which, I have previously

indicated in this memorandum, we cannot embark upon in view at the law.

SUBJECT: FBI FOREIGN LIAISON PROGRAM

Memorandum Mr. Sullivan to Mr. Tolson dated 6/7/71 (attached) sets

forth arguments against expansion of our foreign liaison program and suggested

some of current liaison offices could be closed. Mr. Beaver attached a note

pointing out expansion was at specific request of the White House. Director

requested Mr. Dalbey for his views:

Memorandum Mx. Dalbey to Mr. Tolson dated 6/8/71 (attached) strongly

recommended expansion (1) because of White House request, (2) because of political,

economic and social foment abroad being exploited by Communists and (3) because

of his personal experiences in foreign liaison during World War II when the Bureau

was praised by high Government officials for accomplishments. The Director

commented, "Please look into this. I gather from Sullivan's memorandum that he

is not only against further expansion but would close down some of our present

liaison posts and doubts whole value of our foreign operations."

Since 1/1/71 a record has been maintained of items of interest disseminated

to the White House. These are summarized monthly memoranda. My review

reflects so far this year over 200 items have been furnished to the White House,

The Director has received several warm letters of appreciation from Dr. Kissinger.

In his letter of February 25, 1971, Kissinger commented on information concerning

and said, "The information is being given careful con-

Sideration and reports of any further contact with,

"will be appreciated."

On March 3, 1971, he commented, 'It is gratifying that efforts thus far have been.

so fruitful ... your contributions in the foreign area are deeply appreciated ..."

On May 13, he referred to further information rel

-views on Soviet

role in the Middle East and said, "This information is very useful and I appreciate

your sending it to me." On June 8, Dr. Kissinger commented upon a disseminated

item relating to the

"Information of this kind is a valuable

contribution to the intelligence collection effort, and it is most gratifying to have

the Bureau's continued support and assistance in matters of national security interest."

SUBJECT: FBI FOREIGN LIAISON PROGRAM

Memorandum Mr. Sullivan to Mr. Tolson dated 6/7/71 (attached) sets

forth arguments against expansion of our foreign liaison program and suggested

some of current liaison offices could be closed. Mr. Beaver attached a note

pointing out expansion was at specific request of the White House. Director

requested Mr. Dalbey for his views:

Memorandum Mr. Dalbey to Mr. Tolson dated 6/8/71 (attached) strongly

recommended expansion (1) because of White House request, (2) because of political,

economic and social foment abroad being exploited by Communists and (3) because

of his personal experiences in foreign liaison during World War II when the Bureau

as meated, he does into to as her acco ulives me mora iren that he

is not only against further expansion but would close down some of our present

(liaison posts and doubts whole value of our foreign operations."

Since 1/1/71 a record has been maintained of items of interest disseminated

to the White House. These are summarized monthly memoranda. My review

reflects so far this year over 200 items have been furnished to the White House,

The Director has received several warm letters of appreciation from Dr. Kissinger.

In his letter of February 25, 1971, Kissinger commented on information concerning

Dr. Charles Malik in Beirut and said; "The information is being given careful con-

sideration and reports of any further contact with Dr. Malik will be appreciated."

On March 3, 1971, he commented, 'It is gratifying that efforts thus far have been.

so fruitful ... your contributions in the foreign area are deeply appreciated ...."

On May 13, he referred to further information re Dr. Malik's views on Soviet

cole in the Middle East and said, "This information is very useful and I appreciate

your sending it to me." On June 8, Dr.. Kissinger commented upon a disseminated

item relating to the World Peace Council. 'Information of this kind is a valuable

contribution to the intelligence collection effort, and it is most gratifying to have

the Bureau's continued support and assistance in matters of national security interest."

OBSERVATIONS

My only personal experience was gathered during inspection of our office

¡in Mesico City. I am contaced our operation there is extremoly valuable. However;

Re:: FBI Foreign Liaision Program

(Mexico City is an operational office whereas the others are not and in my opinion

l! this goes to the crux of the matter.

Mr. Sullivan is talking in terms of "hard

intelligence" and it is very true that because we are not operational in other areas

we cannot directly obtain information concerning foreign espionage operations:of

other governments. But in reviewing samples of dissemination to the White House

I find, much of the information relates to political, economic and social areas.

While much of this information is picked up in conversations, newspapers and

various sources, Bureau personnel are probably far more qualified than State

Department personnel to put things in the proper perspective and to sense relative

importance.

In view of specific request of the White House, continued highly favorable

comments of Dr. Kissinger, and because we are producing a substantial volume

of valuable political information; I feel we should go forward with the expansion

Please refer to the attached copy of a memorandum

from. Mr. Callahan to Mr. Mohr, dated 6/8/71.

This memorandum

points out, that the proposed expansion of loreign liaison.

would result in an approximate cost of $1,083,000. In regard

to this matter, i

must take what will be an unpopular position;

one which runs counter to the present trende

Frankly, I do not think that what we are getting from

our foreign liaison offices warrants such a tremendous

expenditure.

We must lace up to the hard realities in this ..

"matter.

Specifically, I refer to the lact that, with the

exception of one oilice, we are operating on strictly a liaison

basis in foreign countries.

We are not operational; therefore

the kind of intormation we receive, in the main, cannot be

considered high quality, firm,

positive intelligence data.

"This is the kind of data

in which the President is interested.

I recognize fully that there will-be some who will

disagree with me, but as I follow and understand our foreign

liaison operations the more convinced I am that what we

receive falls into four main categories, i.e,

(1) there is information given to us which is in the nature

1(2) we receive opinions of native contacts in the countries

where we are, or in some

instances people in those countries

(¿rom other nations;

(3) we receive what might be called "planted" information,

expressly material which our native contacts give to us which

they want conveyed via the FBI to the White House or other

pertinent high-ranking U.S. Officials---information that

would serve the interests of their own countries; and

(1) lastly, we do from time to time develop information that,

at least to us, appears to be of value, but this is not in

suificient quantity to justify the expense of our operations.

The same can-be said of data relating to our criminal

responsibilities.

it is a natter of

common sense to conclude that

Iwe cannot develop hard, high quality, positive intelligence

Joy sending men to these countries only in a liaison capacity.

They would have

to be operational, with penetration of

communications and the development of covert

sources in

sensitive areas.

It would take years to actually develop

operationally in foreign countries to the point where the

product can be considered to be in depth and of great value.

It has been recommended, among other things, that we

reopen our office in Brazil.

Some years ago I strongly recom-

mended closing

that office because it was clearly unproductive.

There is no reason to believe now that it would be any more so.

Il The same is true of othes offices.

It seems to me that the time has arrived to take a

very honest, cold, impactial. 100k at our foreign liaison

operations.

We should ask ourselves the question, "Would any

real harm be done this nation ife did not expand and i a

number of our current liaison Offices were closed, with the

money saved thereby being put to something more Vorthwile

yand the manpower applied to our heavy domestic responsibilities?"

#o-+1407797643)

In a notation on the attached routing slip of June 8, 1971,

to the Director from Mr. Beaver, the Director asked for my views on

the subject matter

-- the expansion of the FBI's Foreign Liaison personnel;

offices, and activities:

I recommend the expansion for three reasons, as follows:

The suggestion that we expand originated at the

White House, and was said there to be based on

the quality of information valuable to the President

that we have been able to provide. If it is the

judgment of the President and his Advisers that

this Bureau is able to provide unusually good in-

formation, and that they need more of it, we

certainly are in no position to deny or disagree.

jIt safely can be said that the people in the White

House know better than we the value of the infor -

mation which we have provided. I will trust their

judgment.

2.

pIt seems hardly open to question that the President

of the United States needs good information of this.

type now more than ever before. Political, economic

and social ferment abroad, all bearing on our foreign

relationships, requires more and better information.

This hemisphere alone is a good example. In the

past we have had sporadic trouble with one banana

republic or another but never before have we had

a combination of such difficulties as now are en-

countered in Cuba and Chile which have been taken

over by the Communists, and in several other.

countries which are apparently on the verge of a

revolutionary change. If there is a chance that we can

thelp, we should try.

My limited experience with and memory of the

convinced me that we should be able to produce

superior information.. I was undercover in Chile

for one year and because of that experience,

followed the S.I. S. operation with more than usual

linterest.

I think the files will show that this Bureau

was greatly praised by high government officials

for its s.IS accomplishments. This leads me to

conclude that we can do a superior job again if need

Of CIA, State Department and Military Intelligence agencies; than the

FBI.

There has to be something wrong for him to do süch an

abrupt about face at this time, after agreeing with what we have done

in the past and now being unalterably opposed to any further expansion,

as desired by the President and Dr. Kissinger.

In connection with W. C. Sullivan's memorandum of 6-16-71

captioned "IBI Foreign Liaison Program, " you asked for the recommenda-

tions of Dalbey, Felt, and myself: Separate memoranda prepared independently

by Dalbey and Felt are attached recommending we proceed with expansion of

this program in accordance with the desires of the President and Dr. Kissinger.

On 6-8-71 I stated I did not agree with Sullivan's opposition and noted it

appeared he was not aware this was being considered at the specific request

of the White House based on its evaluation of information we have furnished

in the past.

By memorandum 6-15-71 Sullivan stated, in reply to your request,

that he was getting statistics and reviewing files and would submit a complete

memorandum for you justifying his position. In his current memorandum,

Sullivan sets forth a great deal of rhetoric but about the only facts therein are

the dollar costs of our foreign liaison program furnished to him by the Admin-

istrative Division. I note that he states the cost of the Madrid Office, which

he recommends be closed, has been $152, 952 since it was opened in June,

1969. In this regard, it is interesting to note the current publicity in the news

papers and the fact we wrote the Attorney General on 6-16-71 reporting the

recovery of a painting estimated to be worth $1 million. This recovery is

directly attributable to information obtained by the Legat in Madrid. Thus

the total cost of our Legal Attache operations during the past 10 years,

stated by Sullivan to be $2,256, 715, is greatly offset by this one case.. Of

course & dollar value cannot be put on most Legal Attache operations including

political intelligence furnished the White House, espionage and security data

developed, fugitives located, etc.

Our records show that Sullivan personally inspected the offices

in Bern, Bonn, London, Paris and Rome in the Fall of 1967, as well as the

offices in Hong Kong and Tokyo in the Fall of 1966. Inspection reports pre-

pared over his name are generally laudatory of these operations. No closings

were then recommended and no changed conditions are now cited by Sullivan

to justify his altered position.

Memorandum to The Director

Re: Expansion of Foreign Liaison

I am attaching a memorandum prepared by Inspector H. I.

Child, Jr., on 5-23-69 which is a careful analysis of the program as it

then existed and his observations as to possible expansion. This was pre-

pared at the personal request of Mr. Tolson.. I consider Child to be eminently

qualified to comment in this area as he served abroad for many years prior

to spending a year here as an Inspector during which he inspected six foreign

offices. He is now back in Tokyo performing outstanding services in our

behalf.

Sullivan thinks we should now close some of our long-existing

foreign offices, consider closing recently opened ones in six months, and

is unalterably opposed to any further expansion. I cannot comprehend

this in the light of compliments we have received from the President and

Dr. Kissinger on our operations and the fact that Sullivan made no criticisms

in his last personal inspections or in September, 1970, when the recent

expansion was under consideration. He approved the expansion memorandum

addition to the strictly liaison assignments our Legal Attaches were

responsible for during Sullivan's inspections, they were last Fall given

the further responsibility to collect positive intelligence information,

including political and social data, for the benefit of the White House. On

9-21-70 we sent a letter to the President (copy attached) referring to your

personal discussion with him concerning the serious international situation

and the need for more intelligence information of a high quality. We advised

the President that we were in a position to increase our complement abroad

in order to produce needed information in the foreign intelligence field. To

now advise the President that we are going to cut back andor close some of

our foreign offices we informed the President we were opening and not con

sider further expansion, as now recommended by Sullivan, would certainly

make us look ridiculous:

'Accordingly, as on 6-8-71, I do not consider Sullivan's observa-

tions to be valid and after you have had an opportunity to further discuss this

matter with Dr. Kissinger, recommend we proceed as necessary to fulfil

our responsibilities:

The Diréctor asked for my views concerning the matter at issue

in the attached memorandum, same caption, of 6/16/71, from Mr. Sullivan

to the Director.

My belief was and is that those in the White House who are

primarily responsible for the conduct of the foreign affairs of this

Nation are better judges than we of the value of the foreign intelligence

information which we have been supplying to them. If it is their view

that the value of this information justifies expansion of our foreign

liaison program, I recommend expansion. My recommendation does not

in any way interfere with adjustments within the system of offices

as made necessary by low productivity on the part of some offices and

some personnel if such be the case.

RECOMMENDATION:

That we expand the foreign liaison program.

The Director asked for my views on Mr. Sullivan's 6-page

memorandum, dated 6/16/71, arguing against proposed expansion of

our Foreign Liaison and proposing elimination of most existing Legal

Attache Offices either now or within six months.

Mr. Sullivan has not set forth any information which

causes me to change my position. Three important factors must be kept

in mind: (i) The White House requested both the recent expansion

and the proposed expansion; (2) What is of value to the White House Is

political, economic and social information; (3) we are not attempting to

decide the question on the basis of "hard' intelligence." The White

House is not directly interested in Fugitives located, espionage

subjects identified and cases solved, which are what I think Mr. Sullivan

is. talking about.

THE LEGAL ATTACHE PROGRAV

The Bureau's Foreign Liaison Program has prod to be an invaluable

adjunct to all categories of FBi investigative activity, particularly in view of the

proven incapability, if not indisposition, of CIA and other agencies to adequately

service our requests for inquiries overseas, or even more important, to aggressively

seek the manifold information of immediate value to the Bureau which is available

through well-developed foreign sources. It is obviously important to locate Legal

Attache (Legat) Offices geographically and to staff them in the manner that will

accrue to maximum advantas of the Bureau. The purpose of this memorandum

is, at your request, briefly to analyze existing and potential foreign liaison coverage

from standpoints of both areas involved and personnel. This analysis will be

separated according to the three principal areas in which Legats are assigned

Europe, the Far East, and the Westem Hemisphere.

EUROPE

The Burgu at presenê has five legat Offices in lurope.

process a high volume of cases, but most of this volume consists of uncomplicated

matters which lend themselves

to standardized -- almost mass production --

• handling. Much more important than the number of cases turned over monthly

is the capability to develop sources who can handle Bureau inquiries immediately

and through whom new, pertinent, needed information can be received on a current

basis. In view of limited manpower, the main task facing each Legat is to exercise

produce ve act to directing his eorts, elimina 5312=2lwarginals

productive activities.

Paris : The Paris Office was reduced in complement in late 1967 from

3 Agents and 3 clerks to 2 Agents and 2 clerks:

The office is now staffed by

exceptionally competent people, both Agent and clerical. A heavy work load is

being handled efficiently and without undue strain. Legat Paris covers the former

Madrid territory (Spain and Portugal) and is able to handle work in these two countries

through 3-day road trips about every six weeks. The former Madrid Office had

been regarded mainly as a "listening post" and was closed in 1963 because of low

volume of work.

Conceivably, if work in Africa increased greatly (it is now minimal),

are-establishment of the Madrid Office should be considered. Another possibility

(is reassignment of the Spain-Portugal coverage Irom Paris to kome, still keeping

Memo for Mr. Tolson

Re: The Legal Attache Program

Rome:

The Rome Office was cut in late 1967 from 3 Agents and 3 clerks to 2

Agents and 2 clerks. It is operating very smoothly with present complement and,

in fact, could carry a slightly heavier load. Legat kome has substantially improved

the imperfect liaison which existed in its territory two years ago. Since 1967

road trip coverage of Turkey and Lebanon was discontinued as unproductive.

Coverage is now limited to Italy and Greece, with one-week road trips to Greece

made every other month.

The cases developed from the Graece road trip are

very routine in nature; consisting mostly of matters gleaned from review

of U.s.

visa and immigration files in Athens.

Assistant Legat Theodore A. Korontjis, who

mainly handles liaison in Greece, has informally expressed his intention of requesting

Iretirn to domestic assignment when his present tour expires in 1970.

It is believed

that a Greek-speaking Agent is not essential for the type of work currently existing:

Replacement of Korontjis with a Spanish-speaking Agent would permit assumption

of Spain Portugal coverage by the Home Office, which Rome work load could well

accommodate.

Airline distance from Rome to Spain and Portugal is only negligibly

greater than from Paris:

London: 'Legat London's complement was reduced from 3 Agents and 3

clerks to 2 Agents and 2, Clerks in late 1967. Work load is heavy but actually no

more so than that of Legat Paris, who had adjusted to the reduction somewhat more

gracefully. Continued attention to conscientious streamlining and selectivity and

economy in direction of effort can enable the London Office to function effectively

with existing personnel. However, if assignment of additional personnel to Legats

becomes.practical, and especially if the Spain-Portugal responsibility were shifted

from Paris to Rome, London, of the 5 European offices could best justify a personnel

increase, and increase of clerical complement from 2 to 3 could be considered

warranted.

Bern:

Complement of Legat Bern (l Agent and 1 clerk) has remained

unchanged since the office was opened. Bern covers Switzerland and Austria with

very occasional trips to the tiny principality of Liechtenstein.

Bonn: . Complement of Legat Bonn was reduced in late 1967 from 2 Agents

and ' clerks to 2 Agents and 3 clerks.

Bonn handles work in West Germany and the

Netherlands.

Both the Bern and Bonn Offices are productive and well managed, but

do not have visible expansion potentials that would necessitate of justify

additional personnel. Bonn is in a position to release one of its 3 clerk-stenographers

whenever necessary during extended leave of employees in the other European

as necessary in the one-man Bern Office.

Re: The Legal Attache Program

FAR EAST

We have three Legats in the Far East: Tokyo; Japan. Mantra,

mbay

Philippines; and the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong.

•All Jiaison in the

Orient was handled until 196l by Legat Tokyo. The Manila Office was opened in

1981 and the Hong Kong Office in 1966 with appropriate allocation of geogaphic

responsibilities, Preponderance of work in all three offices, and particularly in

Tokyo and Hong: Kong, has been in the security category. -- with main emphasis

on Chinese Communist matters.

Tokyo! a va no nabacy

=In-late 196% complement of the Tokyo Office was reduced from

2 Agentst and & clerks to 1 Agent and 2 clerks. Territory covered includes

Jacon, Republic of China (Taiwan), South Korea and Okinawa. The latter 3 areas

are covered by road trip of about one week at 2-month intervals. Solidly established

sources provide a wealth of information of value to the Bureau, which of necessity

at present is processed most selectively by the Legat. Sufficient potential for

further exploitation of sources in Japan and Taiwan exists to justify assignment of

la second Agent in event overseas expansion becomes feasible. Competence in the

"Japanese language, written as well as spoken, is important.

Clerical complement

at Tokyo had been 3 until about 1965, when it was reduced to 2. The office has

operated efficiently through extensively streamlining with the 2 clerks, and can

continue. to function with this complement although supply of relief clerks by Tokyo

to other Far Eastern Offices is difficult.

Hong Kong!

Complement of Legat Hong Kong has been 1 Agent and

cierk since time the office was opened.. There are no road trips. Limited potentials

In the nearby Portuguese colony of Macao, plus hazards of travel to that colony:

which is so susceptible to Chinese Communist encroachment and pressure, have

militated against official travel there by Bureau representatives. British authorities,

in approving to doing t the to son catice, were adamant that we not conduct

liaison with Taiwan from Hong Kong in view of the sensitive balance of British

relations with Red China. This factor has precluded our consideration of shifting

coverage of Taiwan (which is located about half-way between Hong Kong-and Japan)

from Tokyo to Hong Kong. Major,work of Legat Hong Kong involves file reviews.?

and liaison within the American Consulate General, which is one of the largest

consulates in the wörld, having more personnel assigned than our embassies in

many of the smaller countries.

Of much importance also is liaison with Hong Kong

Police Headquarters and British Security Service (Mi-S). Although Legat Hong

Kong was continually pressed the Bureau for assignment of additional personnel;

the existing complement should be adequate if efforts are applied by Legat with.

maximum efficiency. Liaison is conducted 100% in English, which is the official

language in Hong-Kong. Knowledge of Chinese is helpful in living in Hong Kong, but

is not essential.

Memo for Mr. Tolson

Re: The Legal Attache Program

Manila: There is very little activity of interest to the Bureau in the

Philippines.

Our office was located there in 1961 largely because of its central

location with respect to Southeast Asia. All liaison in the Philippines is

conducted in English, which is the official language. Spanish is virtually useless

and study of the native Tagalog, Ilokano and Pampanga dialects is impractical.

The Manila Office since its inception has had one Agent and one clerk. Because

of dearth of work in the Philippines and wide extent of the territory, the Legat has

spent a large proportion of his time "on the road," covering all of Southeast Asia,

Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Australia and New Zealand. Much of his travel to far

flung countries has been necessitated in the past by requirement that Legat

interview. FBI National Academy candidates being sponsored by the Agency for

International: Development (AID). Case load at Manila has dropped substantially

during the past 16 months. Manila, If any Far Eastern office, should be considered

for readjustment of territory. The small amount of work existing in Manila itself

could be handled without difficulty by Legat Hong Kong (one hour away by airjet).

A more logical spot for coverage of Southeast Asia might be Canberra, Australia;

or Bangkok

Challand, both of which are more centrally located, have more

potential for expansion of FBI investigative interests and present a more healtful,

secure environment for clerical employees and dependents

Vietnam:

Another area of vital importance to the United States at

this time is South Vietnam, which heretofore has been considered part of the

Manila territory. Saigon currently is the seat of one of the largest U. S. Embassies

in the world in terms of personnel assigned, with enormous U. S. Information

Service, AlD, and. öther auxiliaries:

The CIA operation in Vietnam is by far the

largest it has in the whole world. Although we have in the past had relatively little

case work in Vietran, unquestionably an FBI representative; if solidly accredited

to the Embassy, would be in a position to make an important contribution to the overall

effort through police liaison, and would at the same time serve as a valuable listening

post for the Director. In any. expansion program it would therefore appear that

Saigon should be actively considered.

Taiwan: As noted above, the Republic of China (Taiwan) has been

covered by Legat Tokyo. British attitude makes coverage of Taiwan from our

Hong Kong Office unfeasible. An alternative to increasing Agent complement at

Tokyo from one to two would be opening a new office in Taiwan, from which the

Republic of Korea (South Korea) could conveniently be handled.

If this were

done, one Agent and one clerk at Taiwan would suffice:

It would still be

desirable to retain two clerks in Tokyo; and with the reduction in territory the

second clerk could be made available whenever required for relief duty in other

Far Eastern offices. On analysis, however; it would appear more desirable for

the Bureau to continue to cover Taiwan and South Korea out of Tokyo, as this,

assuming complement at Tokyo can again be established at two Agents, would :

insure a source of Agent relief for the other Asiatic offices, at the same time

maintaining the economy of a more consolidated operation.

Memo for Mr. Tolson

Re: The Legal Attache Program

WESTERN HEMISPHERE

We now have 3 offices in the Western Hemisphere: Ottawa, Canada;

Mexico City, Mexiço; and Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Ottawa:

Legat Ottawa has operated from the beginning with only one

Agent, but with 2 or more clerks. Following the inpection in March, 1969,

clerical complement was raised to 3 and request of Legat for 1 additional Agent

was denied.

Legat processes an enormous volume of investigative matters (484

cases pending on 3/31/69; 282 cases closed during March, 1969), 99% of which

involve liaison with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Although most

of the cases are stereotyped and are handled by use of form communications, the

very volume involved is greatly confining to Legat, limiting his availability for

personal liaison with the highly cooperative RCMP in matters of greater importance

to the Bureau..

For this reason, serious consideration should be given when

practical to assigning a second Agent to office of Legat, Ottawa

Mexico City:

Mexico City has a complement of 12 Agents and 12 clerks

(reduced From 15 Agents and 15 clerks following the inspection' in February, 1969):

The office covers Mexico and five countries' of Central America (Costa Riça;

El Salvador; Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua). Legat operates a large number

of informant nets in Mexico to provide intensive knowledge of potentially subversive

activities along the nathern border of the United States. Criminal investigations

involving border crossings are aiso numerous. During the recent inspection a

rediection of effort was ordered, to concentrate more fully on activities of

direct Bureau interest and less on matters where other U. S. agencies have joint

interest and responsibility. In view of this, it would not appear that increase in

personnel at Mexico in the immediate future will be justifiable

• 3/65

Buenos Aires: The Buenos Aires Office was opened 3/31/67 coincident:

with closing of the Rio de Janeiro Office. Territory includes Argentina, Uruguay

and Brazil. Staff consists of one Agent and one clerk, which was fo und to be

adequate during inspection completed 5/i1/69.

Work load is substantial, but

justification was not seen during the receat inspection for reopening the Rio de

Janeiro Office:

Other Latin American Countries: At present, no regular coverage is

maintained by the Bureau in Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia,

Paraguay; Chile and other South American countries.

Experience has shown that

well planned, aggressive liason does produce worthwhile results for the Bureau in

cooperative foreign areas.

While disposition of some of the above countries toward

the United States has fluctuated, the necessity of maintzining a position of intelligent

defense against the inroads of communism in the Western Hemisphere is clear.

Pursuant to the Director's request, we have considered how we

to supplement our production of intelligence by increasing domestic coverage

on diplomatic establishments of countries of particular interest where we

feel it will provide information of the type desired. Our foreign coverage

can be, stepped up by assignment of 15 additional Agents abroad.

There are presently 28 Agents assigned to our 11 offices abroad..

Re: EXPANSION OF FBI FOREIGN

INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION EFFORTS

We have selected the six new locales for following reasons:

With respect to Tel Aviv, the Israelis have a most competent and

efficient intelligence-gathering network relating to the Arab countries and our

efforts would be directed toward enhancing the flow of strategic information of

this type to the U. S. In Saigon, Vietnam, there is an obvious critical situation

generating the development of political intelligence. We would also be in position

to develop on the spot the identities of Americans traveling in the area,

particularly those subversives who within our own country are working toward

• the overthrow of our Government.

Caracas (Venezuela) is the capital of a country which has been a

prime target for Castro infiltration and subversion efforts. In addition, from.

this strategic point we would be in position to develop political intelligence

regarding Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Trinidad, Guyana and Surinam. There

are strong anti-American segments in all these countries working to deliver

them to Castro, Communist China and Soviet Russia. San Jose is located in

Costa Rica, the southern-most Central American country excluding Panama.

All Central American countries are presently covered as a road trip by Mexico

City Agent. Establishing San Jose as a Legat post would put us in the position

of having an office strategically located to report regarding countries which

are almost constantly in a state of rebellion and change. We would, of course,

eliminate the road trip out of Mexico in establishing San Jose as a Legat post..

La Paz is located in the country (Bolivia) where "Che" Guevara

was killed. It is strategic in its location in that it borders Chile to the south

where a communist regime is about to take over and Peru to the west which

is strongly anti-U. S. to the extent that U. S. interests are being confiscated.

Helsinki (Finland) is in a country bordering Russia and would give us a

strategic listening post in an area where there is a definite need for intelligence.

With respect to both Bolivia and Finland, however, we must be prepared to

encounter difficulties in establishing Legat operations because both governments

are oriented away from the U.S.

Expansion abroad would include the necessity of assigning additional

clerical personnel to certain existing offices as well as to the new offices.

Through past experience we know there is considerable high-level

political intelligence available within the U. S. which can be secured immediately

and with no risk through coverage of diplomats and diplomatic establishments by

• technical surveillances.

During past crises, such as those relating to the

Vidale Hast, Panama, Dominican Republic and Cuba, we have been able to

produce especially significant data through technical coverage of selected

establishments:

We recognize that should we expand our foreign coverage, certain

problems would arise in view of Central Intelligence Agency and State Depart-

ment interests in this area. However, we do feel the Bureau could provide

information through the expansion outlined above which would be of benefit to

the President and that any objections which may arise from other agencies can

be overcome.

ACTION:

him of extent of our present coverage, expansion of our current offices, and

establishment of additional ones as outlined above.

(2) If approved, we will submit our recommendations with regard

to expanding our technical coverage of diplomats and diplomatic establishments

within the U. S. for purpose of producing the intelligence required by the President.

(3) If approved, office of Assistant to the Director J. P. Mohr will

proceed to recommend the additional personnel described above..

(4) It approved, we will instruct all Legats to expand their current

coverage and to advise of their plans and recommendations for accomplishing

this.

This memorandum, with all ticklers attached (including

order to prevent any gossip that might circulate around the

Bureau had I taken the ticklers. off and couted them.

This vill

give you an opportunity to consider the entire matter and decide

at what time you want to release the tickler copies.

As you know, this memorandum is predicated on your state-

ment, written on Mr. Felt's memorandum of 6/10/71 to Mi. Tolson,

which reads: "I would like to have Irom Sullivan

a list of

Ioreign offices he would recommend be closed now."

This complex subject matter will be handled in three

stages: First, I will discuss the offices to be closed now,

01

within

the foreseeable future. These relate to the long-established

foreign liaison offices.

Second, I will discuss the liaison

offices which were opened during the latter part of 1970.

Third, I will make reference to the proposed expansion of

foreign

liaison and the proposed opening of additional foreign offices.

I recommend the closing of this ottice now. it was re-

1969. Since that ime the operational cost

has been $152,952. The Legal Attache's salary is Grade 15, $25,867.

The Legal Attache

as an

outstanding man. However,

the work is simply not there and I

question strongly that what we have received is worth the cost

¡of operating this office.

I believe consideration should be given to transferring

Mr. Kolombatovic to head the oifice in Copenhagen, where the

Legal Attache is being recalled because of a security violation.

"letting the chips fall where they may."

fE had to be overhauled, and it was aù the Director's instructions.

I am also seminded of a statement attributed to Tom Huxley

which, though uttered years ago, fits the present subject-matter

with

rare exactitude. Huxley said that, when faced with a

difficult problem, one should give up all pre-conceived beliefs,

for otherwise no worthwhile contribution can be made.

I do wish, however, to point out that I think My. Felt

made a iseful contribution and a most valid observation when he

commented favorably on the Mexico City Office (and I share his

view), and concluded;

"However,

Mexico City is ar operational

the crux of the matter."

Of course it does, and we should

To sum up, since the offices to which I have alluded

seems to me,

from the standpoint of efficient administration, this money

can be far better spent in

the domestic field, where our primary

responsibilities are and where

our problems are increasing and

beconing ever more complex.

I am sure none of us are wholly

satisfied with

the way we are discharging our operational

responsibilities in all areas of the domestic field. Further,

we would be deluding ourselves if we believed that our Legal

MEMORANDUM FOR ME. SULLIVAN

I have given very careful consideration to your memoranda of.

June 7, 1971, and June 16, 1971, together with the memorandum of

Mr. Wannall of May 27, 1971, which was initialled by you; Vir. Wannall's

memoranium of May 28, 1971, initialled by you; my letter to the President

dated September 21, 1970, initialled by you; your memorandum of

September 22, 1970; Mr. Brennan's memorandum of September 21, 1970,

initialled by you; and also Mix. Child's memorandum of May 28, 1989,

analyzing the work and the accomplishments of our various foreign liaison

onces and the problems incident thereto, together with the recommendations

of Messrs. Dalbey, Felt, and Beaver upon the recommendation made in your

memorandum of June 7, 1971, suggesting the closing down of a number of

the foreign liaison oinees, some of them recently established last December

with your approval.

First and foremost, I want to elarity a point you have raised in

your memoranda, namely that ow foreign liaison offices, with the exception

oi Mexico City, are not operational and that we cannot develop "hard, nigh

quanty, posiave meligence by sending men to these countries only in a

liaison capacity." We do not have the legal right to establish any foreign …

offices on an operational basis. The law specifically limits foreign intelli-

gence operations do coverage by the CIA, and, therefore, we have known

all along that our offices in foreign countries could not be in an operational

status.

I cannot agree thai establishing liaison offices in foreign countries

without being operational prevents us from developing hard, high quality, -

and positive intelligence. Certainly in all memoranda prior to your memo-

rantum of June ", 1971, you did not indicate any such reservation and, in

fact, you specifically initialled the memorandum of Mr. Brennan addressed

Memorandum for Mr. Sullivan

July 21, 1971

reason of your approval of the vazious memoranda dealing with the foreign

liaison operations, you were in accord with the procedures which the Bureau

had followed and

in fact, approved the estaolishment of additional liaison

offices which I listed in my letter to the President of September 21, 1970,

and which I indicated was predicated upon Mr. Brennan's memorandum of

September 21, 1070.

I want to also point out that at no time, either in September or

more recently, did I ever suggest to the President the idea that we should

expand our foreign liaison operations. It was the President's idea expressed

to me in September, 1970, that such expansion should take place, and, as

a result thereof, I submitted my letter to him of September 21, 1970. The

President I know in my presence directed Mr. Haldeman to present my

letter to the President to the Secretary of State for prompt and immediate

concurrence. Several months passed, and it was not until December, 1970,

that Dx. Kissinger inquired of me as to what had happened to the expansion

of our foreign liaison which the President had approved being expanded in

Septerber, 1970. When Itold Dr. Kissinger that this matter had been

delayed in the State Department and that I had been awaiting word for approval

of the same by the Secretary of State, Dr. Kissinger stated he would personally

take this mattes up with the President and that I would receive in a few days

the State Department's approval of the expansion of our foreign liaison.

Beveral days later in December, 1970, I received a telephone call from

Secretary of State Rogers stating that the President had spoken to him about

the expansion of our foreign Baison operations and that he was in full accord

with the same with the exception of the opening of an office at Helsinki in

view of the pending negotiations to be carried on there by representatives

of the Russian Government and the United States Government concerning

the limitation of arms. As I bave previously indicated in my memorandum

to you, I concurred with the suggestion of the Secretary of State and countered

with the recommendation that instead of opening an office at Helsinki, we open

an office at Copenhagen, with which the Secretary agreed.

I heard nothing more about the expansion of foreign liaison from the

President or Dr. Kissinger until June, 1971, when in a conference with the

President, he expressed his desire that we again expand our foreign liaison

in view of the valuable information which had been procured by the Bureau in

ito operations abroad. I indicated to the President that I would confer with

Dr. Kissinger when he would be available about this matter as to obtain any

suggestions he might have.. In the interine, the President left for San Clementes

California, and Dr. Kissinger left on a worldwide trip and both of them have

just returned within the last few days from San Clemente, California,

I outlined the preceding to give you a chronological picture of what

hag taken place in this field. I do not understand the somewhat sudden change

in your attitude to the value and importance of our foreign liaison operations

in view of your concurrance of its expansion in December, 1970, and the

various memorada of Vr. Brennan and Mir. Wannall, who are in direct

contact with the operations of the foreign liaison situation.

Theretore, in view of the what I consider objective review by

Illessrs. Felt, Dalbey, and Beaver together with the many letters and oral

expressions from Dr. Kissinger as to the value of our foreign liaison program,

I cannos agree with your memorandure of June 7, 1971,

This morning I received another memorandum from you transmitting

a memorandum of Mr. Wannali upon the statistical accomplishments in the

foreign liaison program in which you reach the conclusion that by juggling

statistics, you can prove almost anything. I do not share this view, though

I do think that statistics alone do not always prove or disprove a particular

situation.

I have personally over the years reviewed all of lthe material which

we have transmitted to De. Kissinger and much of the material which we have

transmitted to the State Department and other Government agencies concerning

ouz foreign liaison program, and I believe that we have made, as expressed

by the President and Dr. Kissinger, a very valuable contribution to the necessary

Inowledge of the President and Dr.

Kissinger in the foreign field. This has

been accomplished without "operational" functions, which, I have previously

indicated in this memorantum; we cannot embark upon in view of the law.

We have had no indication from any source as to the reason why

Attorney General asked the Director to meet with him, Mr. Helms and

Admiral Gayler on 3/31/71. Since Mr. Helms is Director of Central Intelligence

Agency (CIA) and Admiral Gayler is Director of National Security Agency (NSA),

both of which agencies are deeply involved in production of foreign intelligence,

it would appear that the meeting will probably cover this subject matter.

One of the most pressing problems of the Administration relates to

the control of activities of criminal subversives, such as the Weatherman

group, the East Coast conspiracy and the Black Panthers. Production of

intelligence relating to the proposed activities of such groups has ramifications

both in the domestic field and the foreign field, the latter because of indications

of possible foreign direction and control of these radical militants.

One means whereby intelligence regarding such criminal subversives

could be produced comes within the operational area of Admiral Gayler's agency.

(NSA develops significant domestic intelligence while monitoring foreign

communications traffic; however, such information is not developed on a systematic

basis but as a 'fall out" from other targeting responsibilities. The intelligence

concerns the movement of U. S. nationals abroad, international conferences

and communications to and from U. S. citizens.

Under its operational directive

NSA does not have a jurisdictional mandate to produce intelligence relating to

U.-S. citizens and such "fall out"' intelligence as it has acquired in the past has

(been given to CIA and the Bureau on an extremely confidential basis and has been

referred to by the highly classified code name

We know that in the past Admiral Gayler has been interested in

legalizing this activity so that he can target his intelligence production facilities

to produce material which would assist the Government in its handling of the

criminal subversive element. Mr. Helms would be interested in the legal aspects

of this because as Director of Central Intelligence he has responsibility for

implementing directives under which NSa operates. He or course, would also

have an interest in increasing intelligence output of thef

Utype since

CIA abroad is charged with collection of intelligence relating to foreign

I connections of U. S. individuals and groups.

While Bureau has primary responsibility for internal security matters

which includes production of domestic intelligence, recognizing the possible

foreign ramifications of the present problem relating to criminal subversives, it

is felt we should take advantage of any resources of NSA and CIA which can be

tapped for the purpose of contributing to the solution of this problem.

Our principal sources for production of intelligence in this area are.

electronic surveillances and live informants. We have thirteen telephone

surveillances and one microphone surveillance targeted specifically for the

of intelligence in this field. Among our live informants and sources,

over co are targeted spectical against in our severie individua

forganizations.

In addition, we have approximately 1, 000 potenttal informants and

sources in various stages of development for this same purpose, 'many of whom

are currently providing signiticant intelligence data.. In various ghetto areas

where criminal subversives are concentrated we have over 6200 ghetto informants,

persons residing in the areas or having contacts therein, who have agreed to

provide us with any information of interest to the FBI which comes to their attention

As noted above, we feel that the foregoing matter is the one most

likely for discussion during the 3/31/71 meeting; however, any matter in the

foreign intelligence collection field would appear to be a possible subject for

discussion, in view of the presence of Mr. Helms and Admiral Gayler and

considering their primary missions.

Foregoing is submitted for the information of the Director.

We have had no indication from any source as to the reason why

Attorney General asked the Director to meet with him, Mr. Helms and

Admiral Gayler on 3/31/71. Since Mr. Helms is Director of Central Intelligence

Agency (CIA) and Admiral Gayler is Director of National Security Agency (NSA),

both of which agencies are deeply involved in production of foreign intelligence,

it would appear that the meeting will probably cover this subject mätter.

One of the most pressing problems of the Administration relates to

the control of activities of criminal subversives, such as the Weatherman

group, the East Coast conspiracy and the Black Panthers.

Production of

intelligence relating to the proposed activities of such groups has ramifications

both in the domestic field and the foreign field, the latter because of indications

of possible foreign direction and control of these radical militants.

One means whereby intelligence regarding such criminal subversives

could be produced comes within the operational area of Admiral Gayler's agency

(NSA develops significant domestic intelligence while monitoring foreign

communications traffic; however, such information is not developed on a systematic

basis but as a 'fall out" from other targeting responsibilities. The intelligence

concerns the movement of U. S. nationals abroad, international conterences

and communications to and from U. S. citizens. Under its operational directive

NSA does not have a jurisdictional mandate to produce intelligence relating to

U.s. citizens and such "fall out" intelligence as it has acquired in the past has

been given to CIA and the Bureau on an extremely confidential basis and has been

referred to by the highly classified code name "Minaret Traffic."

We know that in the past Admiral Gayler has been interested in

legalizing this activity so that he can target his intelligence production facilities

to produce material which would assist the Government in its handling of the

criminal subversive element. Mr. Helms would be interested in the legal aspects

Memorandum for Mr. Brennan

Re: DIRECTOR'S MEETING 3/31/71 WITH

ATTORNEY GENERAL, MR. RICHARD

HELMS AND ADMIRAL GAYLER

of this because as Director of Central Intelligence he has responsibility for

implementing directives under which NSA operates. He, of course, would also

have an interest in increasing intelligence output of the "Minaret"' type since

CIA abroad is charged with collection of intelligence relating to foreign

connections of U.S. individuals and groups.

While Bureau has primary responsibility for internal security matters

which includes production of domestic intelligence, recognizing the possible

foreign ramifications of the present problem relating to criminal subversives, it

is felt we should take advantage of any resources of NSA and CIA which can be

tapped for the purpose of contributing to the solution of this problem.

Our principal sources for production of intelligence in this area are

[electronic surveillances and live informants. We have thirteen telephone

surveillances and one microphone surveillance targeted specitically for the

production of intelligence in this field. Among our live informants and sources

over 900 are targeted specifically against criminal subversive individuals and

organizations.

In addition, we have approximately. 1, 000 potential informants and

sources in various stages of development for this same purpose; many of whom

are currently providing significant intelligence data. In various ghetto areas

where criminal subversives are concentrated we have over 6200 ghetto informants,

persons residing in the areas or having contacts therein, who have agreed to

provide us with any information of interest to the FBI which comes to their attention.

As noted above, we feel that the foregoing matter is the one most

likely for discussion during the 3/31/71 meeting; however, any matter in the

foreign intelligence collection field would appear to be a possible subject for

discussion, in view of the presence of Mr. Helms and Admiral Gayler and

considering their primary missions.

ACTION:

Foregoing is submitted for the information of the Director.

1971,I attended a meeting with the Attorney

'General, Mr. Richard Helms, Director of the Central Intelligence Agengg

(CIA), and Admiral Noel A. Gaylor, Director of the National Security

Agency.

This meeting had been requested by Mr. Helms and was for the

purpose of discussing a broadening of operations, particularly of the very

confidential type in covering intelligence both domestic and foreign.

Admiral Gaylor stated that he was most desirous of the FBI resuming the

so-called "black bag" job operations. There was some discussion upon the

part. of Mr. Helms of further coverage of mail. Covevs

I stated to the Attorney General,.

Mr. Helms, and Admiral Gaylor

that I was not at all enthusiastic about such an extension of operations insofar

as the FBI was concerned in view of the hazards involved. The Attorney

General stated that he thought before he could make any final decision in

this matter, Mr. Helms should make an in-depth examination of exactly what

he and Admiral Gaylor desired and then submit to the Attorney General and

myself the results of this examination, and he, the Attorney General, would

call another meeting of this particular group and make the decision as to what

could or could not be done.

Mr. Helms said he would take care of this very promptly.

It is fundamental that the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Investiga

tion is to detect and prosecute crimes against the United States. This authority i

found in the appropriation provided by the Seventy-Sixth Congress, Chapter 248, Firs

Session, under Title II, Department of Justice.

This, of course, mould embrace the

investigation of espionage, counter-espionage and sabotage matters; however, to be

more specific the Fresident on June 26, 1939 in a confidential nemorandum addressed

to the heads of several government departments stated:

"It is my desire that the investigation of all

espionage, counter-espionage, and sabotage matters be controlled

and handled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the Depart

ment of Justice, the Military Intelligence Division of the War:

Department, and the office of Naval Intelligence of the Navy

Department. The directors of these three agencies are to fune-

tion as a committee to coordinate their activities.

"No investigation should be conducted by any inves-

tigative agency of the Government into natters involving actually or

potentially any espionage, counter-espionage, or sabotage, except

by the three agencies mentioned above.

"I shall be glad if you will instruct the heads of all.

other investigative agencies than the three named, to refer immed-

lately to the nearest office of the federal Bureau of Investiga

tion any data, information, or material that may come to their

notice bearing directly or indirectly on espionage, counter-espionage,

or sabotage."

It will be further noted that the President

issued a forma? statement on

September 6, 1939 wherein he again specifically charged the Federal Bureau of Inves

gation with the investigation of matters relating to espionage, sabotage and violat

of the neutrality regulations as follows:

"The Attorney General has been requested by me to

instruci the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the Department

Attorney Gen

of Justice to take charge of investigative work in matters re-

lating to espionage, sabotage, and violations of the neutrality

regulations.

"This task must be conducted in a comprehensive and

efiective manner on a nationel basis; and all intormation mist

be carefully sifted out and correlated in order to avoid confusion

and irresponsibility.

"Io this end I request all police officers, sheriffs,

and all other law enforcement officers in the United States promptly

to turn over to the nearest representative of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation any information obtained by them relating to espionage,

counterespionage, sabotage, subversive activities and violations of

the neutrality laws."

An Executive Order dated September 5, 1939 further charges the Department

of Justice vit the enforcement of the neutrality of the United States as prescribed

in the President's Neutrality Proclamation, not especially delegated to other govern-

ment agencies, and with the prosecution of violations of the neutrality of the United

States. Toward this end an Executive Order dated September 8, 1939 authorized the

Attorney General to increase the personnel of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in

such number not exceeding 150 as he shall find necessary for the proper performance

of the additional duties imposed upon the Department of Justice in connection with

The President,

The Holte House.

Wy dear He. President:

Under date of May 21, 1940, President Freakdin D. Roosevelt, in

a memorandam addzessed to Attomay Ganaral Jackson, stated:

"You are therefore authorized and diracted in such

cases as you ney approve, after intestigation of

the need in each case, to authorize the necessary

investigating agents that they are at liberty to

secure information by listening devices directed

to the conversation or other communications of per-

sons suspected of subversive activities against

the Government of the United States, Including sus-

pected spies."

This directive was followed by Attorneys General Jackson and

Biddle, and is being followed currently in this Department. I con-

sider it appropriate, however, to bring the subject do your acteation

at this tine.

It seems to me that in the present troubled pariod in interna-

tional affairs, accompanied as it is by an increase in subversive ac-

• tivity bere at home, it is as necessary as it was in 1940 to take the

intestigative measures referred to in President Roosevelt's memoran

dum. At the same time, the country is threatened by a very substan-

tial increase in crine. While I am reluciant to suggest any use what

ever of these special investigative measures in domestic cases, it

seems to me imperative to use them in cases vitally affecting the

domastic sacurity, or there aman life is in jeopardy.

• As so modified, I balieve the outstanding directive shoule bs.

continued in force. If you concur in this policy, I should appreci-

ate it if you would so indicate at the foot of this letter.

In my opinion, the measures proposed are within the authomity

of lan, and I have in the files of the Depariment materials indi

cating to me that my tro most recent predecessors as Attorney General

would concur in this view.

Respectfully yours,

Attorney General.

commander may prepare himself for the discharge of the possible respon-.

RE: FRED J. COOK

•DETAILS

Fred J. Cook is well-known to the Bureau and is on the "List of Person

Not to be Contacted. " Cook is a discredited New York journalist who has specialized

in reporting on crime and has worked primarily with "The New York World-Telegram

and Sun." He is the author of books and numerous magazine articles.

INFORMATION IN BUFILES:

Fred Cook has gained a reputation as an unprincipled critic of the FBI

and an outspoken apologist for Alger Hiss and William Remington. He authored an

article entitled "The FBI! which appeared in the 10-18-58, issue of "The Nation. "

This article was highly critical of Mr. Hoover and the FBI and sought to picture the

Bureau as inefficient and a menace to American freedom. It was apparent that Cook's

article was a part of an over-all plan to smear the FBI. While there was no indicatior

that Cook personally had any political leanings, it was apparent that he would do

anything for money and that in writing this article for ''The Nation" he was a tool of

those left-wing elements who desired to discredit Mr. Hoover and the FBI.. This

article took up this entire issue of "The Nation. "

Cook had written critically concerning the Bureau prior to the appear-

ance of above article in 1958. He had an article in the 9-21-57, issue of "The Nation"

which was entitled 'Hiss: New Perspectives On the Strangest Case of Our Time.

This was an extremely prejudiced article which inferred that the FBI had been guilty

of "framing" Alger Hiss. He later expanded this material into a book which was

published under the title "The Unfinished Story of Alger Hiss.". It has been reported

that Cook was a good friend of Alger Hiss.. With regard to the William Remington

case, Cook wrote an extensive article on this case which appeared in the 12-28-57,

issue of ""The Nation." He entitled this article "The Remington Tragedy: a Study of

Injustice." This article, of course, was most sympathetic to Remington.

Cook had an article in the 1-25-08, Issue:of The Nation" which was

entitled,

"Boris Morros: Hero of a Myth."' This article was highly critical of

Morros, who was a Bureau informant. The 5-24-58, issue of "The Nation" carried

a review of "Masters of Deceit"' by Cook. In this review; Cook did not attempt to:

attack the Director's views, but rather asserted that by writing this book Mr. Hoover

was attempting to discourage original thinking in the country.

RE: FRED J. COOK

Bufiles reflect that in March, 1947, Cook contacted the Bureau

relative to writing a series of articles on hijacking for "The New York World-

Telegram and Sun." Material concerning six cases was furnished Cook and the articles

appeared in that newspaper in May,

1947, Subsequently, an action for damages of

$25, 000 was brought against the newspaper and Cook by one Morris Harris, who had

been erroneously referred to in one of Cook's articles:

The information we originally

furnished to Cook, however, was accurate

In September, 1952, we cooperated with Cook in furnishing him

material for use in preparing an article on car theft rings. This article appeared in

the November, 1952, issue of "The Reader's Digest."

Cook's blatant disregard for the truth is well-documented. In connectic

with an article that he wrote for the 10-31-59, issue of "The Nation, " entitled "The

Shame of New York;

;" he was invited to appear on David Susskind's "Open End" TV

program.

His collaborator in writing this article, Eugene Gleason, a reporter for

"The New York World-Telegram and Sun," also appeared on this program. During th

interview by susskind, Cook told of an alleged bribery offer by a New York official

Which had been reported to him by Gleason. Subsequently, after the TV program,

Gleason admitted that the story of the bribery offer was a lie. As a resuli of this

incident, both Cook and Gleason were dismissed by "The New York World-Telegram

and Sun." Cook had claimed on the television program that he had reported the

bribery attempt to his "World Telegram" superiors; however, this was denied by

officials of the newspaper.

In an article entitled "Gambling, Incorporated," which appeared in the

10-22-60, issue of "The Nation;" Cook indicated that he was in favor of the creation of

a Federal Crime Commission to fight syndicate-controlled professional gambling in

this country:

• He was most critical of the Director in this article for "never tackling

the big-league American underworld," and for "throwing his impressive weight agains

any attempt to create a centralized federal agency to battle syndicated crime."

In a highly distorted article entitled "J. Edgar Hoover--The Reluctant

Dragon; " which appeared in the February, 1962, issue of "Climax" magazine, a

sensational-type publication of very limited circulation, Cook stated that the FBI and

the Director have done little to combat organized crime and that the Director had

gone to great effort to squelch attempts to establish a national crime commission.

also stated in this article that "self-portrait of Hoover as a reluctant dragon has been

tarnished by a couple of well-defined tendencies:

acquisition of virtually

unchallenged power, a capacity to lap up praise on one hand and to explode in fury

whenever criticism rears its unlovely head on the other." Generally speaking, this

article was a rehashof previous articles critical of the FBI and the Director by

Cook,

On 5-28-61, Cook appeared on an NBC broadcast which was moderated

by Dave Garroway.

Cook was interviewed concerning a book on organized crime which

he had written, entitled "A Two Dollar Bet Means Murder." Cook stated during this

program that the FBI and Mr. Hoover had made no real effort to fight organized crime

in the United States. Cook made similar assertions on a Mike Wallace TV program

on 6-15-61,

indicating that organized gambling controls a "politician" and that

'John Edgar Hoover is the best politician of them all."

A highly confidential source reported in December, 1963; that the

Communist Party was considering having Fred J. Cook prepare an article concerning

the background of the assassination of President Kennedy. With regard to Cook's

political leanings, Bufiles contain no subversive references identifiable with Cook,

• but as indicated previously he will sell: his services to anyone if the price is right.

A newspaper article dated 1-30-68, contained an advertisement from

a group called the "Writers and Editors War Tax Protest." It indicated that

individuals signing the advertisement believed that American involvement in Vietnam

is morally wrong and that none of them would voluntarily pay the proposed 10% income

tax surcharge and that many of them would not pay 23% of the current income. tax

which was being used to finance the war. Cook was one of the persons listed as a

signer.

On 1-3-69, United Press International identified "Fred J. Cook,

Englewood, N. J., author," as a member of a board of a new National Committee to

Investigate Assassinations. Former Special Agent William W. Turner and James

Garrison, District Attorney, in New Orleans, Louisiana, were also listed as members

of this Committee. The news item indicated that Cook had written for "Ramparts"

June 16, 1975

Special Agent Joseph E. Battle, currently assigned to the

Washington Field Office, Federal Bureat vi Investigation, furnished the

following information:

Approximately two weeks subsequent to the death of former

Director J. Edgar lioover on 5/2/72, $4 Battle accompanied Robert G.

Kunkel, former Special Agent in Charge of the Washington Field Oilice,

to Mir. Hoover's former residence. When they arrived at the residence

they went into the basement area and obtained approximately eight card-

board boxes which were sealed and which they loaded in a Bureau station-

wagon. This material was then transported to the loading dock at the

rear of the Washington Field Office and he does not know what happened

to the material except that it was picked up by either Kenneth Shatter,

• Assistant Chief Clerk, or Thomas Barden Dudney, Chief Clerk,

Washington Field Office.

Ho cotimatce shut ut icari imo tripo and possibly thrce merc

made to Mr. Hoover's residence with Mir. Kunkel and on each occasion

approximately eight caraboard boxes were returned to the Washington

Field Office in the manner described above. He believed the above

described events took place over a period of approximately two weeks

and stated that the third trip could possibly have been by himself. He

thought possibly that he may have gotten a radio call while in the Bureau

car to pick up the material to return to Washington Field Oftice. He does

not know what the cardboard boxes contained and can't recall that he was

ever told what they contained by Mr. Kunkel.

During the removal of the cardboard boxes from the base-

ment of Mr. Hoover's residence he does not recall ever seeing any file

cabinets located in the basement area.

He has no recollection of picking up any material from the

office of Mr. Hoover subsequent to his death for delivery anywhere.

James E. Crawford, 9727 Mt. Piscah, Apartment 604, Silver Spring,

Maryland, telephone mumber 439-3664, furnished the following information:

Crawiord was the former chauffeur of Director Hoover. Shortly after

- the death of former Associate Director Clyde A. Tolson, Crawford mentioned to

former Assistant to the Director John P. Mohr that he would like to have some card-

board boxes in which to pack pictures. At the time of Mr. Hoover's death there were

numerous pictures in the recreation room of his residence which were later placed in

the attic of the residence. On several occasions he had broken glasses in some of these

pictures and desired the cardboard boxes to store these pictures to prevent this type

of thing from haypening.

Fle believes Mr. Mohr contacted someone at FBI Headquarters

and Ralph Windear, employed by the FBi in the Mechanical Section, brought about a

dozen small cardboard boxes to Mr. Hoover's former residence about two days after

Vr. Tolson died. He utilized about ten of these boxes to store the aforementioned

pictures and these boxes including the pictures are still in the attic of Mir. Hoover's

residence. He believes he used three of these cardboard boxes to dispose of old

canned goods and several jars of honey which had turned black. These three boxes

were later picked up by the garbage collectors. He said that Windear denvered the

empty cartons to the house in a van-type vehicle and that no one else was with Windear.

He has never seen anyone take anything out of Vir. Hoover's former residence and

that he has never done so.

He has heard all kinds of rumors to the effect that files were located in

the house and even/tile garage but that these rumors are without foundation.

June 18, 1975

James E. Crawford, 9727 Mount Piscah, Apartment 604, Silver

spring, Maryland, was interviewed at the former residence of J. Bogar Hoover by

SA J.E. Henehan and SA Fred B. Griffith, and he furnished the following information:

He has acted as a caretaker for Mr. Hoover's house and took care of

the property at the time of Mr. Hoover's death.

He was a former chauffeur for

Mr. Hoover. Since Vir. Hoover's death he has been at the residence on almost a

daily basis. During the period of time immediately after the death he is certain

that a large number of nile cabinets were not brought into the house. Any file

cabinets brought into the house at that time are still present. He asked the inter-

viewing Agents to accompany him to the recreation room and he counted six file

cabinets present which consisted of two 3-drawer, three 2-drawer and one 6-drawer

cabinets. He pointed out that he believes two of these cabinets belong to Mr. Tolson,

with the other four storing personal papers of Mr. Hoover. He is absolutely certain

that 20 file cabinets were not brought to the house from the Justice Building at any

time after the death of Mr. Hoover as he would have had to be aware of same. He

pointed out that the size of the recreation room was such that 20 file cabinets would

almost fill the room and he could not help but be aware of their presence.

ile

advised that he is extremely tired of the continued claims of "secret files" at Mr.

Hoover's house. in the past a claim was made that there were "secret files" in the

garage. The garage is filled with miscellanecus items but there has never been

any files of any kind stored there. In fact, he is not aware of any files ever being

in Mr. Hoover's garage or house except for those items he considered to be Mr. Hcovers

personal papers which, for the most part, are still there.

He recalled that he was present in Mix. Hoover's house the day that

books were removed from the attic for shipment to Quantico. He believed these

books were boxed and he could not estimate the number of boxes but recalled that

they were shipped to Quantico to the Federal Bureau of Investigation library there.

Dole of Ironscription June 25, 1975

James F. Crawford, 9724 Mt. Piscah, Apartment 604, Silver

Spring, Maryland, was interviewed at the residence of former fBI

Director J. Edgar Hoover and furnished the following information:

He was the chauffeur for Mr. Hoover and also acted as care -

taker at Mr. Hoover's residence. He recalled that he has been at

Mr. Hoover's house on almost a daily basis since Mr. Hoover moved

there in 1942.

Following the death of Mr. Hoover on 5/2/72 he was at the

residence daily. He was present when much of the material was moved

into the house or when anything was moved within the house and it was in

tact his general responsibility to take care of matters at the house. As

such, he was quite familiar with all things that came into the house in

the way of boxes, cabinets, etc., and where that material was located

in the house.

The only file cabinets that were brought into Vir. Hoover's house

aiter his death were the six file cabinets currently located in the base-

ment of the residence: They consist of two 3-drawer brown cabinets with

two 2-drawer brown cabinets on top of them in one corner of the

recreation room plus one 2-drawer brown file cabinet and one 6-drawer

brown cabinet in what was formerly the bar area of the basement. The

two cabinets in the bar area contain material of Mr. Clyde A. Tolson,

former Associate Directer, and the remaining four contain Mr. Hoover's

material. These are the only file cabinets that have been brought to the

house since Mr. Hoover's death. It would have been impossible that

there were 20 to 25 file cabinets stored in the recreation room for any.

length of time without his knowledge and there were none.

He does not recall specifically when or how the existing six file

cabinets came into the house but has the recollection that the four cabinets

now containing Hoover material came to the house shortly after Mr.

Hoover's death, that is within several days, and the two file cabinets

now contal ning Mr. Tolson's material came out separately at a later date.

He has a recollection of Ray Smith, a Mechanical Section employee,

being at the house on several occasions subsequent to Mr. Hoover's death

in connection with the movement of material from former Director Hoover's

office to the house. He has no recollection of Smith delivering any filing

cabinets to the residence. He recalls that on one occasion Smith was there

unioading a number of cardboard boxes which were brought into the recrea-

tion room. He believes, but cannot be certain, that Tom Peyton, employed

in the Exhibits Section, and a young unidentified white boy whom he took to

be a messenger helped Smith carry these boxes into the recreation room.

He has no recollection any time subsequent to Mr. Hoover's death

of Miss Helen W. Gandy, Mr. Hoover's Executive Assistant, and two other

white females being in the recreation room. He has no recollection of

Miss Gandy being present and issuing instructions as to where material

being brought into the recreation room should be placed. As pointed out

earlier, the storage of material at the house was his general responsi-

bility and

ordinarily he would receive a call from Miss Gandy saying that

material was being delivered to the house with instructions as to the

general area where this material should be placed.

He recalls that on at least one occasion Clyde Carey, a Bureau

driver, was at the house helping to move boxes from the recreation room

to the attic of the house. These boxes contained all the photographs and

mementos which had been taken from the walls and elsewhere in the

recreation room immediately after the death of Mr. Hoover to make room

for the other boxes coming out to the house from Mr. Hoover's office.

It is his recollection that Mr. Tolson moved into Mr. Hoover's

residence sometime in June or July, 1972.

Special Agent Joseph E. Dowling, Federal Bureau of Inves -

tigation, Washington Field Office, Washington, D. C., furnished the

following information:

Sometime shortly aiter the death of J. Edgar Hoover on

5/2/72 he went to Hoover's home in the company of then Special Agent

in Charge Robert G. Kunkel of the Washington Field Office. They

drove in a Bureau car and parked in the alley in the rear of Hoover's

residence. They went to the basement of the residence where he noticed

about 10 to 12 cardboard boxes in a utility room which he said was an

area containing laundry tubs and a washer. The boxes were about 14"

by 14"' by 14" and were sealed. He believes Miss Helen W. Gandy came

to the door of the utility room and said hello to him. Kunkel went into

the recreation room of the residence but Dowling did not. They took

the boxes described above, placed them in the trunk of the Bureau car,

transported them to the loading dock at the rear of the Washington Field

Office, where a ciericai empioyee too the boxes to an undisciosed

location. He does not know what was in the boxes and Kunkel dia not

tell him. He does not know what happened to the boxes or their contents.

This was the only occasion subsequent to the death of Mr. Hoover that

he has been at Mr. Hoover's house.

At no time did he participate in picking up any boxes in the

office ofVr. Hoover for delivery elsewhere and he never delivered any

Thomas Barden Dudney, currently employed as Chief Clerk, Washington

Field Office, Federal Bureau of investigation, furnished the following information:

A month or so following former Director Hoover's death on 5/2/72, he

received instructions from Robert C. Kunkel, then Special Agent in Charge,

Washington Field Office, that he, kunkel, would be picking up some boxes at lir.

Hoover's former residence and bringing them to the Washington Field Office where

the contents were to be destroyed. He recalled that during about a two-week period

alter being informed of the above by Kunkel, on approximately four or five occasions

Kunkel and SA Joseph Battle delivered sealed cardboard boxes to the loading dock

at the Washington Field Otfice. On each occasion he or Kenneth Shaffer would meet

Kunkel at the loading dock and take the boxes into the Washington Field Cifice. As he

recalled on each occasion the boxes were delivered during regular working hours and

on Kunkel's instructions were placed in the vault. Due to the noise of the disintegrator

the material contained in the boxes was destroyed before or after regular working

hours. On one or two occasions he assisted Shaffer in the destruction of the material

and on one or two occasions Shaffer alone destroyed the material. In destroying the

material the contents of the boxes were placed on a plattorm and led gradually into

the disintegrator. He had occasion to look at some of the material which consisted

solely of personal correspondence of former Director Roover. All of the material

was destroyed.

He estimated that there werea total of four ot five cardboard boxes of

this material measured about 14"' by 16" by 10".

He recalls no instance where any material other than that mentioned aboze

was brought to the Washington Field Office either from Mir. Hoover's former residence

or FBI Headquarters for destruction.

John P. Dunphy, Section Chief, Exhibits Section, Administrative Division,

was interviewed by Special Agents Robert P. Keehan and Joseph E. Henehan on

0/11/75 and he furnished the following information:

He was Chief of the Exhibits Section on 5/2/72, the day Director Hoover

died, and he assisted in the handling of funeral arrangements at the request of

Assistant to the Director J. P. Mohr. He believes that he was out of his office

most of that week making contacts with the National Presbyterian Church,

Congressional Cemetery and Government agencies. George Cheesman, now retired,

would have relieved Dunphy on his desk.

He knows that employees from his Section went to the Director's Office

to remove items from the office as requested by personnel in the Director's Office.

He is not aware of the movement of anything from the Director's Office to former

Assistant Director - Deputy Associate Director W. Mark Felt's otfice.

Dunphy presumes that he was told by Tom Pevion or Brent Hughes from

his Section about the plaques and other items of historical interest which were

i removed from the Director's Office and as he recalls these items were placed int

supply storage at that time and subsequently moved to the Old Post Office Builling

where these items are presently located. The thought was that these items could

be considered for use on the tour route in the/fBt Building.

He has no knowledge of the removal of files, records or documents from the

Director's Office and while he has been to Mr. Hoover's house since his death, he

has never taken any items to the house or removed any items trom the house.

On 6/13/75 Mr. Dunphy was telephonically contacted by Special Agent Keehan

and advised that one of the employees believes that Dunphy took some employees to

Mr. Hoover's house in a car in connection with the movement of boxes from the

Direcior's Office. Dunphy said that he had no recollection of taking anyone out to

Mr. Hover's house in a car in connection with any movement of boxes from the

Director's Office.

He does not know of any inventory listing of items in the boxes of material

presently located in the Old Post Office Building. He checked with Tom Peyton and

On 6/12/75 W. Mark Felt, former Acting Associate Director of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation, 3416 Wyniord Drive, Fairfax, Virginia,

telephone sto-sa1o turnished the following intormation concerming the movement

of material from the Office of former Director I. Edgar Hoover to Felt's office

subsequent to the death of Hoover on 5/2/72:

He believes that sometime shortly after Hoover's death Miss Helen W.

Gandy, who was then Hoover's Executive Assistant, called him and said she was

sending some things to him. She may have said files or material. Re does not

recall receiving any instructions regarding the retention of the material or what

to do with it. He had the impression that Miss Gandy was telling him in effect,

'It's your problem now."

It was his impression that it was at least five or six days after Hoover's

death before the material referred to by Miss Gandy was first brought to his office.

He recalled that it came to him in "dribs and drabs." fle cannot identify the

individual or individuals who may have brought this material to his office.

Concerning the material described as 'official - confidential files of

Hoover's,

Felt recalled the following:

About six or seven days after Hoover died, a young, good-looking white

boy whom he assumed to be from the Director's Office came into Felt's office at

about 6:30 p.m. with a four-wheel "dolly" which had on it an estimated six or seven

cardboard boxes. These were not sealed. The cartons were placed in a closet

back of the desk in the oftice occupied by then Associate Director Clyde A. Tolson.

He described this closet as "just a little cranny, " triangular in shape. He does

not know the identity of the boy who brought them in and he does not recall whether

anyone besides himself was in the office at that time. He suggested that possibly

Wason Campbell or Bill Soyars may have been there but has no specific recollection

that they were.

Concerning the material in the boxes he said that these were folders with

loose material in the folders. He does not recall any file jackets and said it was

his impression that it was "a bunch of junk." He does not recall any official Bureau

files in this material. He felt that what Miss Candy had sent to him was "what was

left after she sorted out personal stuff and regular files."

He thinks the material stayed in the closet several days and thereafter

was "spread around" in various existing cabinets in the office. He recalled that

five or six 2-drawer combination sate-type cabinets had been ordered and placed in

Tolson's office.

When these cabinets arrived the material was taken from the

cabinets where it had originally been placed and transferred to the safe-type

cabinets. Approximately two months later these sate-type cabinets were moved

into another room in the suite of offices. He described this room as the first

room off the reception room to the left. He cannot recall who transterred the

material to these cabinets but believes he may have assisted others in this task.

He never physically reviewed this material but did glance through it.

He could recall seeing a "real old folder" dealing with Eleanor Roosevelt.

Sometime after the arrival of this material Neil Sullivan, a Bureau

supervisor, came over and made a complete inventory of all the material and

he does recall reviewing the completed inventory. He does not think this inventory

included anything other than the material from Mr. Hoover's Office. Other than

Neil Sullivan he knows of no one who made a systematic review of this material.

He has no recollection of Tom Smith, another Bureau supervisor, reviewing any

of this material but said it was entirely possible that he had.

He does not recall seeing any inventory or list of the material accompanying

this material from the Director's Office.

He has no recollection of removing anything from this material and

sending it elsewhere. He pointed out that he was concerned with the so-called

"secret dossiers" and wanted to maintain all of it so that then Acting Director

I.. Patrick Gray Ill could review it. In that connection he stated that to his

knowledge Gray did not review this material.

Based on his review of the inventory prepared by Neil Sullivan, he has

no recollection of any folders on Charles W. Bates, Leland V. Boardman or Alex

Rosen. Since these were former or present Bureau officials he feels certain he

would have noted this and probably would have looked at the folders to see what

they contained. He has no recollection of any official files contained in this material

and specifically did not recall seeing anything on Lyndon Johnson or John F. Kennedy.

He stated that he and his Administrative Assistant Miss Carol I'schudy were the

only two persons with the combination to the file cabinets where this material

was maintained. When specifically asked he said it was possible that the material

had been stored temporily aiter its arrival in some gray cabinets in his office. That

would be after it was removed from the closet and before it was placed in the safe-

type cabinets. He had a vague recollection of some gray cabinets which were later

turned over to some other office and whoever received them had a problem with the

combination on one of these cabinets.

Other than the material sent to his oftice from the office of Mir. Hoover

he had the impression thai Hoover's "personal papers" were taken to Mr. Hoover's

house aiter Hoover's death for review by Miss Candy. He has no personal know-

ledge, however, of anything that went to Vir. Hoover's house and said that Miss

Gandy sent nothing back to him after reviewing this personal correspondence.

On 6/13/75 he telephonically advised as follows:

He is certain that the material contained in the six or seven cardboard

boxes placed in the closet in Mr. Tolson's office was the material from Mr. Hoover's

Ostice. He recalled that upon the resignation of I. Patrick Gray III, Acting Director

of the FBI, material from Gray's Office was also sent down to Felt; however, this

consisted of no more than two cardboard boxes. He could not specifically recall

whether the Gray material was placed in the closet but said it was quite possible

that it may have been. He is certain he is not confusing the two incidents.

Annie Fields was interviewed at the former residence of 1. Ecar

Hoover by SA Joseph I, Henehan and Fred B. Griffith and she furnished the

following information:

She has been employed as the housekeeper for Mr. Hoover since

April 29, 1952, some twenty-three years. She has living quarters in the basement

of the home and was living there at the time of Mr. Hoover's death. She recalled

that she has probably been at the house almost every day during the period immediately

alter Mr. Hoover's death and is not aware of any large number of file cabinets

being brought into the house and any file cabinets that were brought in are still

there. The six file cabinets currently in the basement she believed were brought

in during the period shortly after Mr. Hover's death.

These cabinets are still there

and she is not aware of any others. She would have to be aware of 20 file cabinets

being brought into the basement recreation room as her room is only a short

distance away. At no time did she ever see a large number of file cabinets in the

recreation room. When advised that the cabinets were alleged to have been brought

in through the upstairs kitchen, she advised that this was "impossible." If tile

cabinets were brought into the house she would never permit them to be brought

in through the upstairs as the back basement door would be much more convenient

and would avoid having people track through the kitchen and upstirs hall. This

proves to her that the claim 20 file cabinets were brought into the house is without

foundation because tey would never have baen brought in through the upstairs,

in addition to the fact she never saw them.

She had no information of any files being maintained in Mr. Hoover's

house.

Miss Helen W. Gandy, Apartment 915, 4801 Connecticut Avenue,

Northwest, Washington, D. C., telephone number Emerson 2-6909, former

Executive Assistant to then Director J. Edgar Hoover, l'ederal Bureau of Investigation,

furnished the following information:

There was maintained in the Office of Mr. Hoover certain material

which was referred to as "official - contidential files" or "OC files." At the time of

Mr. Hoover's death Ifiss Gandy estimated thai these OC files comprised about 1 1/2

file drawers. She does not recall when the maintenance of these files commenced but

speculated it was sometime during the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt. She

does not recall Nir. Hoover ever specifically saying why he wanted these files main-

tained in his office but she assumed they were maintained in such fashion for "secrecy"

and explained she meant by this they were maintzined in this fashion so that Bureau

personnel would not have unrestricted access to the contents. She pointed out that

these files contained information which if made public might adversely effect the best

interests of the United States. She pointed out that some of the contents pertained to

high Government officials and if such information was disclosed it might seriously

hamper the effectiveness of those officials.

These files were physically maintained by Miss Gandy or in her absence

' by Mis. Erma Metcalf who was also assigned to Mr. Boover's Office. Mr. Hoover

designated the material to ba placed in these files, generally by marking "OC" on the

communications he desired placed therein.

She said these were "not active files" and referred to only on rare

occasions. She knew of no instance where any of the material contained in these

files was used for anything but official purposes. Miss Gandy stated that no Bureau

officials had random access to the CC files and if it was necessary to review these

• filas for official purposes Mr. Hoover was notified and if he felt such a review was

necessary, the person desiring to review the files was required to do so in her office.

The material contained in the OC files was indexed. This indices was

maintained by Miss Gandy utilizing 3x5 salmon-colored cards for this purpose and

pertained only to the CC files.

There was no provision made for a periodic review of these files for

destruction of material.

Sometimes copies of communications located elsewhere in official

Bureau files were placed in the OC files if the information in the communications

pertained to the subject of that OC file. This was done so that the information would

be more readily available it needed and time would ba saved in locating the material.

Mr. Hoover had told Wiiss Gandy that the official - confidential files should

be turned over to whoever was running the Bureau "when he left. "

In addition to the above-described official - confidential files, there

was also maintained in the Office of Mr. Hoover certain regular official Bureau files.

These filled approximately to file drawers according to Miss Gandy. These files

were also maintained in Mr. Hoover's Office to prevent random access by other FBI

personnel and included the official files on such persons as Lyndon B. Johnson,

Richard M. Nixon and former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.

. In addition to the above-described files there was also maintained in

Mr. Heover's Ofice a large number of personal correspondence files.

These files

contained correspondence of a strictly personal naturebaween former Director Hoover

and other individuals and did not contain official Bureau communications. These

personal correspondence itles were contained in an estimated 10 - 12 five-drawer

filing cabinets. There wes a separate indices for the personai correspondence files,

also maintained by Miles Candy, utilizing white 3x5 index cards.

Immediately aiter Mr. Hoover's death Miss Gandy called Mr. John P.

Mohr, then Assistant to the Director, concerning the disposition of the OC files at

which time it was decided they should be moved to the office of W. Mark Felt,

Assistant Director - Deputy Associate Director. She cannot recall specifically but

either she or Mr. Mohr then called Mc. Felt to make the necessary arrangements.

She and Mrs. Erma Metcalf then placed the OC files in boxes and they were thereafter

moved to Vir. Felt's oifice. She recalls this was done either on the day of Mr. Foover's

death or the day following. She does not recall who physically moved the files to

Mr. Felt's office.

In addition to the official - confidential files, Bureau monographs and

bound interesting case write-ups were also moved from Mr. Hoover's Office to Mr.

Felt's office. The index cards relating to the OC files were also sent to Mr. Felt's

office.

Nothing of an official nature, Bureau files or property, was sent to

Mr. Hoover's house or elsewhere outside the Bureau after Mr. Hoover's death. To

emphasize this Miss Gandy said, "Not even his badge."

With regard to Mr. Hoover's personal correspondence files, Miss Gandy

said she had been instructed by Mr. Hoover sometime prior to hie death, exaci dote

not recalled, to start a review and the destruction of these files. As she recalled

approximately one-third of these files had been reviewed and destroyed at the time

of Nr. Hoover's death. Immodiately after Mr. -Hoover's dooth Miss Gardy assisted

by Mrs. Metcall continued the review and destruction of the personal correspondence

files. Each file was roviewed to insure it contained nothing of an official nature and

the communicatione were disposed of by placing in the contidential trash and picked

up by the security patrol clerks for ultimate destruction.

Miss Candy's last day at work was 5/12/72. She had not completed the

review and destruction of the personal correspondence files at this time. Mir. relt

offered to make available to her a room on the fifth floor of the Justice Building where

she could continue her review and destruction of these files. She declined and stated

she proferred to complete this at Vir. Hoover's residence. The remaining personal

correspondence files estimated by her to consist of seven five-drawer filing cabinets

were then placed in boxes and transported to Mr. Hoover's residence. She does not

recall who handled the move of these files.

Based on written notations on a calendar currently in her possession

Miss Gandy continued her review of these files at Mr. Hoover's residence on 5/13/72

and with the exception of Saturdays and Sundays she worked each day at Nir. Hoover's

house completing her review and destruction on 7/14/72. As the material was

reviewed she placed it in cardboard koxes/se

sealed these boxes which were subsequenti

picked up by personnel in the Washington Wield Citice for final destruction.

She also destroyed the index cards pertaining to the personal correspon-

dence files.

During her review of these files she found nothing of a official Bureau

nature contained therein. No one assisted her during the review of these files at

Mr. Hoover's home. Mrs. Metealt had assisted her while at Bureau Headquarters bit

did not assist at Mr. Hoover's home.

After Mr. Hoover's death quite a large amount of material was taken to

Mir. Hoover's house which consisted of gifts he had received, glits he had purchased for

others and various personal mementos. She does not specifically recall the persons mbs

packed or moved the personal effects to Mr. Hoover's house.

Each item in Mir. Hoover's house was inventoried by the District of

Columbia Tax Assessor's Office and according to notations made on a calendar in the

possession of Miss Gandy this inventory was conducted on 7/11-13/72.

Miss Helen W. Gandy, Apartment 915, 4801 Connecticut Avenue,

Northwest, Washington, D. C., former Executive Assistant to J. Edgar Hoover,

Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation, furnished the following information:

The first time she was at the residence of Mir. Hoover aiter his death

was the day she arrived there to commence reviewing material from his personal

correspondence file which according to records kept by her was on 5/13/72.

At that time the recreation room in the basement of his home contained

two tables, two 4-drawer filing cabinets which contained Mr. Hoover's personal

investment papers and which had previously been maintained in his office in the

Justice Building, and a large number of cardboard boxes. These boxes contained

a variety of material, mainly the mementos and such that had been packed at his

office and brought to the home. There was one stack of cardboard boxes at the

end of the room in front of the fire place which reached nearly to the ceiling. There

were other such cardboard boxes scattered throughout the recreation room area.

There were no other file cabinets in the recreation room other than the two safe-

type cabinets mentioned above.

In the basement of Hoover's home there was a small area immediately

off the recreation room which was used as a bar. In this room she observed when

she first came to the house a number of file cabinets. She could not describe

them but recalled that they were lined up on the back wall which was immediately

adjacent to the maid's room. She cannot recall the number of file cabinets but

indicated in her own apartment the wall which she felt was the same length as the

wall she had reference to in the bar. It was pointed out to her that roughly 6 to 8

file cabinets would fit in the space indicated and she agreed that this was probably

correct. In addition, she recalled that there was one file cabinet located in a

corner just before entry into the recreation room. She could not recall how she

knew this but was of the distinct impression that these file cabinets contained material

belonging to Clyde A. Tolson. She based this on the fact thai the material belonging

to Mr. Tolson and Mir. Hcover was carefully segregated in the house and it was aiso

her recollection that she had seen Dorothy Skillman, Tolson's Administrative

Assistant, working on these file cabinets at sometime in Mr. Hoover's home. She

did not go into these file cabinets to determine their contents as she knew they were

not Mr. Hoover's.

house when Smith was there subsequent to the death of Mix. Hoover. She specifically

has no recollection whatscever of Smith delivering a large number of file cabinets,

approximately 20 or more, to the recreation root of tir. Hoover's house. She

is positive there were no other file cabinets in Mr. Hoover's house other than

those she has described above during the time she was at the house.

There was no material including records, files or any other communica

tions belonging to Mr. Hoover maintained anywhere in FBI space other than his office

suite. She pointed out that there was no dead storage space in any other area for

out-of-date records noting that such out-of-date material in his office was destroyed

when no longer needed.

She knew of no one other than herself who subsequent to Vr. Hoover's

death would have issued any instructions concerning the disposition of material

from Mr. Hoover's Olfice including instructions regarding delivery of any such

material to his home or anywhere else. The only other females that were ever

in Mr. Rcovor's house with her subsequent to his death were Bornthy Slallman

and Annie Fields, Mr. Hoover's maid. Mrs. Oldliman came to Nir.

Ecover's

house the first time after his death after Mrs. Skillman's retirement on 6/12/72.

At that time Eirs. Skiliman utilized the recreation room to work on masters

pertaining to Mr. Tolson's affairs. She specifically recalled that neither Edna

Holmes or Erma Metcali were ever at Mr. Hoover's house subsequent to his

death while she was there.

She noted that James Crawford, Mr. Hoover's former chauffeur and

caretaker at his house, was in charge of overseeing the movement and placement

of material in vir. Hoover's house.

She has no recollection of two young white males helping move material

into the basement of Vir. Hoover's home while she was there.

She pointed out that she had nothing whatsoever to do with the movement

of any of Vir. Tolson's possessions to Mr. Hoover's house after the death of Mr.

Hoover. She suggested that possibly Dorothy Skillman or J. P. Mohr would be

the individuals who attended to this. She did recall that Mr. Tolson moved into

• the house shortly after Mr. Hoover died as she urged him to do so to insure there

would be no vandalism taking place.

Miss Helen W. Gandy, Apartment 915, 4801 Connecticut

Avenue, Northwest, washington, h. C., furnished the iollowing intor

mation telephonicady:

After further reflection she now believes that she may have

been at the residence of former Director J. Edgar Hoover, Federal

Bureau of Investigation, subsequent to his death on one or two occasions

prior to 5/13/72 which she had earlier stated was the first time she

had been at his residence subsequent to his death.

She said it is her recollection that "when the bank took over

the estate" within a few days after Mr. Hoover's death she met at Mr.

Hoover's home with Vir. Richard E. Brewer and a Mr. Sabitini of the

Riggs National Bank, Mr. Clyde A. Tolson and possibly Mr. J. P.

Mohr. She recalled they sat around the dining room table in Mr.

Hoover's house going over matters pertaining to Mr. Hoover's estate.

She recalied that it was necessary for her to go down to the recreation

"room and bring up all the "stock folders" which filled one file drawer

in a cabinet in the recreation room. She also recalled that either Annie

Fields or James Crawford obtained Mr. Hoover's jewel box from up-

stairs and the contents of this were listed by the people from the bank.

She thought the entire procedure took about two hours.

She also now recalls that the four file cabinets currently in the

corner of the recreation room of Mir. Hoover's house (two 2-drawer

and two 3-drawer) were those cabinets which she had immediately behind

her desk in her office at the Justice Building. At the time the material

was being moved from Mr. Hoover's office to his home she arranged to

have these cabinets together with their contents moved to the house.

• These four cabinets contained all personal papers of Mr. Hoover which

required retention for estate purposes. She said that included in the

material were copies of all income tax returns ever filed by Mr. Hoover,

separate folders on each of his stock investments and separate folders

on each of his oil well investments.

She says she has a recollection of seeing these file cabinets put

in place in the recreation room and can specifically recall a discussion

with Tom Peyion at the time concerning the possibility of placing them

in a wooden cabinet in which they had previously been maintained in her

office. She recalled that Peyton did some measuring and for one reason

or another found it impossible to do this.

While unable to fix the time of the incident mentioned above in

relation to the death of Mr. Hoover, she feels that it may have been

within a matter of a few days.

Albert P. Gunsser, 401 Sligo Avenue, Silver Spring, Maryland, telephone

JU 9-6069, was interviewed by Special Agents Joseph E. Eenehan and Fred B.

Griffith and furnished the following information:

He is a former Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

having retired on 6/30/72. In approximately August, 1972, he volunteered to handle

former Associate Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Clyde Tolson's

personal income tax returns and related records. He has been so engaged since

August, 1972, and except for some vacation trips to Florida, normally worked a half

day every day, Monday through Friday, at Mir. Tolson's home which is the former

residence of J. Edgar Hoover.

He set up an office in the basement recreation room of Mr. Tolson's house

and at no time has there ever been 20 file cabinets in that room since he began working

there in August, 1972. Any file cabinets brought to the house as far as he knows are

still present and he is not aware of one being moved. There are presently two three-

drawer file cabinets and two two-drawer file cabinets with personal papers including

tas information of Mr. Hoover and one six-drawer tile cabinet and one two-drawer

file cabinet with similar personal papers of Mr. Tolson. There were never any other

file cabinets present in the house since August, 197%, and the aforementioned six

cabinets are still there.

He is completely familiar with official FBI files and has never been aware

nor has he ever seen any present in Mr. Tolson's house. He feels it would be

utterly impossible for 20 file cabinets to be placed in the recreation room as the

room is too small and is made even smaller by the desk and working area he set up

as well as other desks that were utilized in this room by other individuals. There is

absolutely no foundation to the claim that there were 20 file cabinets in this room or

even to say that there were more file cabinets in the room than are presently on hand.

Robert G. Kunkel furnished the fellowing information:

He is currently the Special Agent in Charge of the Alexandria, Virginia,

Office, Federal Bureau of Investigation, lie served as Special Agent in Charge

of the Washington Field Office from August l, 1970, to October 22, 1972.

Shortly after the death of Vir. Hoover on 5/2/12, exact date unrecalled,

he was telephonically contacied by Miss Helen W. Candy, Ixecutive Assistant to

former Director Hoover. She requested him to transport a number of boxes which

she had packed in her office with personal correspondence belonging to Mr. Hoover to

Mr. Hoover's residence. He, accompanied by an Agent from WFO, believed to be

either SA Joseph Battle of SA Joseph Dowling, did on a few occasions go to her office,

picked up the boxes and delivered them to Mir. Hoover's residence. He recalled that

on each occasion they would stop by the Courier Service office at FBI Headquarters,

pick up a four-wheel flat cart to transport the boxes from the office on the fifth floor

to the place where they were loaded into a station wagon assigned to the Washington

Field Office.

The boxes were then transported to the residence of Mr. Hoover where

they were taken into the basement entrance and placed in the basement area. He canno:

recall if Miss Candy was at Mr. Hoover's residence each time the boxes were

delivered.

Also at about thise me time, through arrangements made with Miss Candy,

sealed boxes were picked up from

the basement area of Mr. Hoover's residence which;

according to Wiss Gandy, contained the personal correspondence she bad reviewed and

discarded. These were taken to the Washington Field Citice where they were destroyed

by having the contents of the boxes run through a disintegrator.

The individual per-

forming the destruction was Assistant Chief Clerk Kenneth Shaffer. He pointed out

that Miss Gandy was concerned about the discarded correspondence falling into the

hands of individuals who had previcusly gone through the trash at Mir. Hoover's

residence and to preclude this possibility wanted the discarded correspondence des-

troyed in the method described above.

He has no personal knowledge of the contents transported to or from the

residence of Mir. Hoover as the contents were sealed.

He has no knowledge whatsoaver of any files being moved from the Office of Mr.

Hoover to the office of Assistant Director - Deputy Associate Director W. M. Felt,

or any other place.

Mrs. Erma Metcali, Administrative Assistant to Director

Clarence M. Kelley and former Administrative Assistant to J. Edgar

Hoover, Federal Bureau of Investigation, furnished the following

intormation:

On 5/2/72, the date of Mir. Hoover's death, she was employed

as his Administrative Assistant and was at work in the Director's office.

As part of her duties she took care of the filing and indexing

oî material maintained in the "official - confidential" files. Material

filled about two file drawers. She estimates that she commenced such

duties no sooner than 1965. Prior to that time these files had been

maintained by Miss Helen W. Gandy, txecutive Assistant to former

Director Hoover. She described these files as "very inactive" and it

was "very very seldom" that anyone needed anything from these files.

It she received a request for anyone to examine any material in these

fles she would refer the request to Miss Gandy to determine whether

the request should be granted. She stated that to her knowledge these

fles were never used for other than official purposes.

She started working in the Director's office in 1956 and became

aware that the official confidential files existed in about 1963 when she

was promoted to Administrative Assistant. She does not recall ever

being advised as to the reason these files and folders were maintained

in Mr. Hoover's office but she had always understood that the official-

confidential files were to go into the regular Bureau files "whenever

Mr. Hoover left."

In addition to the official- confidential files there were about

one or one and one-half file drawers which contained official Bureau

files.

She recalled that Mr. Hoover died on Tuesday, 5/2/72. Shortly

thereafter and she cannot remember specifically, it may have been on

5/2/72 or subsequently during that week she received instructions that

these official-confidential files were to be sent to the office of W. Mark

Felt, then Assistant Director - Deputy Associate Director. She does

not recall who issued those instructions but presumed it would have

been Miss Gandy as she would have been the logical person to do so.

Since it had been her understanding that these files were to go into

the regular Bureau files whenever Mr. Hoover left she assumed that

they were being sent to Mr. Felt's office so that he would put them into

the regular Bureau files. She recalls that she took the official-confidential

files from the file drawers, put them in cardboard boxes and sent them

to Mr. Felt's office. The boxes were not sealed.

She does not recall who physically transported them to Mr. Felt's

office bui felt certain it had to have been someone from the Director's

office. She said that normally one of the clerical employees trom the

Director's reception room would have been the person to handle some -

thing like that, She does not think it was handled by anyone outside the

Director's office. She described the cardboard boxes utilized as about

three feet, by twenty inches, by twelve inches. She has no recollection

of the number of boxes utilized. She balieved that the official - confidential

files were delivered to Mr. Felt's office by Wednesday of the weel of

Mr. Hoover's death and she knows it was definitely within that week.

There was an index for these official confidential files consisting

of three by five cards. It is her recollection, but she cannot be certain,

that these index cards were pulled at a later date and sent to Mr. Felt's

office.

The official Bureau files, previously mentioned, were also sent

to Mr. Felt's office as well as a number of "Bureau monographs that

were scattered through various file drawers" which were also sent to

Mr. Felt's office. She cannot recall whether this material all went down

at one time or whether it was sent on separate occasions.

Mrs. Metcalf was shown a Xerox copy of an eight-page document

captioned, "List of Official-Confidential Files in Director's Office." In

the upper right hand corner of this document are the words "Typed

October 20, 1971." That notation was lined through and handwritten

above it was "4-3-72." She stated that she had prepared this document

and identified the notation "4-3-72" as her handwriting. She cannot

recall specifically why this list was prepared but she does recall going

through the folders in the official-confidential files and typing the

captions of the folders on the list. It was noted that the list was

generally double spaced with the exception of the first page wherein

there was a number of single spaced listings. Specifically, the second

entry is listed as, "Alsop, Joseph Wright, Jr," which is single spaced,

immediately after the irst entry and immediately before the third

entry.

She recalled that prior to his death Mr. Hoover had instituted

a review of his personal correspondence files. During his review of the

file pertaining to Joseph Wright Alsop, Jr., he apparently designated

that the material placed therein should be placed in the official -

conüdential files; therefore, the folder on Alsop would have been placed

in the official-confidential files. She believes that the original list dated

10/20/71 was probably reviewed by her on 4/3/72 and any folders which

had been added since the original preparation of the list would have

been inserted in proper alphabetical order on the list. She pointed out

that there were a number of single spaced entries on the "B" section of

the list and surmised that vir. Hoover may lave compietea a review of

his personal correspondence files through the "Bs" and as in the case

oi Alsop indicated that the material on a certain individual should be

included in the official-confidential files in which case folders would

have been placed therein which resulted in her adding these to the list

of "Bs"' when she checked the list again on 4/3/72. She cannot recall

this specifically but fee's it is a plausible explanation.

It was pointed out to her that the list dated 10/20/71 included

the following captions:

Bates, Charles W.

Boardman, Leland V.

Jaffe, Philip Jacob, was, et al, Espionage C

Rosen, Al

It was pointed out to her that the above four folders had not been

located during a review of the official-confidential files in early 1975.

She stated' that she had no recollection of removing these folders from the

MW 55140 DocId: 32989635 Page 331

## Page 332

official-confidential files and had no information concerning their

absence from the official confidential files when reviewed in early

1975.

There is a check mark immediately to the left of each entry on

the above-described list and two check marks to the immediate left of

all entries on the first page and the first six entries on page two. She

does not recall specifically the significance of these check marks but

thinks she may have checked them off as she removed them from the

file drawers when placing them in the boxes to be taken to Mr. Felt's

office. She was unable to explain the significance of the double checks

marks on pages one and two.

She thinks, but cannot be sure, that this list was sent with the

official-confidential files to Mr. Felt's office.

Mrs. Erma Metcalf, Administrative Assistant to the Director, Federal

Bureau of Investigation, was shown the contents of a folder captioned "index -

Cabinets-1 - 9. " She was unable to identify all the material in the folder;

however, she furnished the following information concerning that material with

which she was familiar:

Document captioned "List of Official Confidential Files in Director's

Office" with "Typed October 20, 19%%," in the upper right-hand corner, scratched

through in pencil and penciled above "4/3/72" was originally typed by her on

10/21/71. She made up this list based on a review she made of the folders in

Mr. Hoover's Official Confidential files. She believes but cannot be. certain that

when she packed the Official Confidential files in boxes to be sent to the office of

W. Mark Felt after the death of Mr. Hoover, she may have sent this list to

Vir. Felt with the Cificial Confidential files.

Concerning the penciled date of

4/3/72 Mrs. Metcall said it was entirely possible that this should have been

5/3/72 rather than 4/3/12 inasmuch as 5/3/72 would have been the approximate

date she was getting these files ready to go to Mr. Felt. Stapled to this document

is a pink Director's routing slip dated January 21, 1974, which has the following

typed on it: "You wanted to be reminded about the material being held in Mr.

Callahan's office for review.

Mr. Callahan's office subsequently located a list

of Official Confidential files turned over to Mr. Felt immediately following

Mr. Hoover's death." Mrs. Metcalf stated she had typed this routing slip and

forwarded it to Mr. Kelley. She recalled that in January, 1974, there was some

inquiry made by the Director concerning this material and it was her recoilection

that Ruth McCord from the Director's Office obtained from Mir. Callahan's office

the original inventory prepared by Neil Sullivan describing this material. She

speculated that after Miss McCord's inquiry the list which she had prepared

10/20/71 had come to someone's attention in Mir. Callahan's office and they in turn

had sent it up to the Director's Ofice for whatever use they might have for it.

The typed paper captioned "Material Turned Over to Mr. Felt, May 5, 1972,'

dated in the upper corner May 5, 1972, was prepared by Mrs. Metcalf. It lists

the material sent to Mir. Felt on May 5, 1972, and included on this list is the

following:

Mr. Mohr was on duty at FBI Headquarters on 5/2/72, the date of former

Director Hcover's death. Sometime during that day he had a conversation with Miss

Helen Candy who indicated to him that prior to Mr. Hoover's death Mr. Hoover had

told her to start destroying his personal correspondence files. As he recalled Miss

Gandy indicated she had completed destruction of approximately one-third of these

files at the time of Mr. Hoover's death. Miss Gandy indicated to Mr. Mohr that she

had talked with Clyde A. Tolson, then Associate Director of the FBI, as to whether

she should continue destruction of these files and was informed by Mr. Tolson that .

#she should continue. Mr. Mohr stated that Miss Gandy subsequently informed him

That when 1. Patrick Gray Ili, who had been appointed Acting Director, came through

n a tour of the Director's Office, Miss Gandy told him that she was destroying Mir.

Hoover's personal correspondence files and that Mir. Gray told her to continue with

that destruction. Miss Gandy told Mr. Mohr that W. Mark Felt, former Assistant

Director - Deputy Associate Director had offered to make available to Miss Gandy a

room on the fifth floor of the Justice Building where she could continue review and

destruction of the personal correspondence files; however, Miss Gandy declined this

offer. He said Miss Candy preferred to have these files taken out to IvIr. Hoover's

house and he thinks arrangements were made whereby personnel from the Mechanical

Section of FBI Headquarters brought these files to Mr. Hoover's house.

He was also

of the imprassion that Mrs. Erma Metcalf, then assigned to the Director's Cifice,

assisted Miss Gandy in the review of these files at Mir. Hoover's residence prior to

their destruction.

Vir. Nohr stated that following Mr. Hoover's death a large number of

boxes containing gifts Mr. Hoover had received plus gifts he had purchased to give

to friends were taken from Mr. Hoover's Office to his residence. He had no specific

information as to who transported this material to Vir. Hoover's residence.

Sometime after Mr. Hoover's death, dates not recalled, personnel from

the District of Columbia Tax Assessor's Office came to Vir. Hoover's residence and

in the company of Mr. Mohr inventoried the entire contents of Mr. Hoover's home for

tax purposes. It is his understanding the complete inventory is maintained in the

District of Columbia Tas Assessor's Office.

Mr. Mohr advised he knows of no official - confidential files taken

to Vir. Hoover's house subsequent to his death and stated "there were never any

Bureau files taken to Mir. Hoover's house." He pointed out during the inventory of the

contents of Mr. Foover's house mentioned above he would have seen such files had

they been there and observed none.

Concerning the official - confidential files maintained in the Office of

Mr. Hoover, Mr. Mohr stated that while he was aware certain files were maintained

wouldn't go browsing through them."

At no time did he issue any instructions concerning the disposition of

thése files after Mr. Hoover's death.

He recalled a conversation with Miss Candy

very shortly after Mr. Hoover's death wherein she either told him that these files

were being transferred to Mr. Felt's office or asked him if these files should be

transferred to Mr. Felt's office.

In either case, he would have agreed that they

should be transferred to Mr. Felt's office and it was his understanding that this was

dono; however, ho has no specific recollection as to who performed this funetion.

As he recalls Miss Gandy indicated that the volume of official - confidential files

which were to be taken to Mr. Felt's office consisted of approximately 1 1/2 file

drawers. Miss Gandy subsequently told Mr. Mohr that she had also sont to Mr. Felt's

office a number of Bureau monographs together with bound "interesting case" write-ups.

At this point Mr. Mohr observed that prior to Mr. Hoover's death, exact

dates unrecalled, information had been received that former Assistant to the Director

William C. Sullivan had turned over to Robert Mardian of the Justice Department

the files on "17 White House wiretaps" and at that time Mr. Hoover ordered all

Assistant Directors to turn over to Vir. Felt any files maintained by them in their

offices. He recalled that "quite a bit' was turned over to Felt. Mr. Mohr made

this observation by way of explaining that Felt would have had the above-mentioned

files in his office prior to the time the official - comfidential files were brought to

his office from the office of Mr. Hoover. Mr. Mohr advised that currently there are

two four-drawer filing cabinets at Mr. Hoover's former residence which contain

"mainly investment data." He has gone through this material and there are no Bureau

files or property whatsoever included.

Mr. Mohr was specifically asked if he knew of any files taken from

Mr. Hoover's Office to the apartment of Associate Director Clyde A. Tolson after

Mr. Hoover's death and he stated he had no information whatsoever that such had

occurred.

him is he could obtain some cardboard boxes to pack some stuff in at Mis. Hoover's

house. Mr. Mohr recalls contacting someone, identity not recalled, at FBI

Headquarters and made arrangements to have some empty cardboard boxes brought

to Mr. Hoove.'s house. He recalled that Ralph Windear, & Bureau employee,

subsequently brought some empty boxes to Vir. Hoover's residence and gave them

to James Crawford. Mir. Mohr does not know what Crawiord utilized these boxes for

but thinks he may have put trash in them.

Mr. Mohr has no information whatsoever to indicate that any files were

removed from Mr. Hoover's residence subsequent to the death of Clyde Tolson.

Vr'. Mohr stated that he has gone through Mr. Tolson's effects since his death and

no official Bureau files are included therein.

John P. Mohr, 3427 North Edison, Arlington, Virginia, former

Assistant to the Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation, furnished the

following information telephonically:

His first recollection of being at the residence of former FSI

Director J. Edgar Hoover following Hoover's death on 5/2/72 was

around July, 1972, when people from the District of Columbia Tax

Assessor's office were there. He is positive he was not at Mr. Hoover's

Residence when of cia rot the lie atone Bas, ye shingtya ter

Vir. Hoover's death. He does know that someone from the bank was

there shortly after Mr. Hoover's death through conversations he has

had with Miss Helen Gandy, former Executive Assistant to Mr. Hoover.

On this first visit to Mir. Hoover's residence the recreation

room was "over half full of cardboard boxes," which he estimated to

we over 250 in number.

He has no knowledge whatsoever of 20 to 25 file cabinets being

delivered to Mr. Hoover's former residence, does not think that this

could have occurred and has no idea where such a large number of file

cabinets could have originated. He made no arrangements with anyone

to take any file cabinets to Mr. Hoover's residence subsequent to

F. Thomas Peyton, Visual Information Specialist, Exhibits Section,

Federal Bureau of Investigation, residence 5604 Buckingham Palace Court,

Alexandria, Virginia, telephone 971-5486, furnished the following informa

tion:

He entered on duty in August, 1945, and was employed in the

Exhibits Section on May 2, 1972, the day IVir. Hoover died. He believes

he received a telephone call from Miss Helen Gandy, Executive Assistant

to former Director Hoover, on Way 3, 1972, and was asked to come to

the Director's office. In the Director's office he was told by Miss Gandy

that "We have to pack everything." She asked Peyton to have all of the

plaques, pictures, and other items in the Director's office packed. Miss

Gandy packed many of the personal items in boxes and sealed the boxes.

Miss Gandy or Mrs. Metcalf packed the three dimensional items which

were in locked bookcases in the telephone room. Brent Hughes from the

Exhibits Section handled the packing of many of the plaques. Miss Gandy

told Drent flughes and Feyton which items were Dureau property and

could be taken from the Director's office for possible later use by the

Exhibits Section. Peyton believed he could use some of these items in

the new FBI building which was under construction.

Peyion had some of his helpers take the packed boxes from the

Director's office to the loading do ok in the basement of the Justice Building

where they were placed on a trick. He believes he used both a stake -body

truck and a panel truck. The boxes were taken to Mir. Hoover's residence

and placed in the recreation room. The furniture which had been in the

recreation room was movegto the attic of the house.

The movement of boxes from the Director's office took several

days and boxes were piled so high in the recreation room that some of the

boxes that were only three-quarters filled began to collapse and it was

necessary to restack the boxes. He would estimate that the total number

of boxes moved into the recreation room was about one hundred.

Peyton did not pack any files, documents or any other records

in the Director's office and does not know that any such files or records

were taken to the recreation room in Mr. Hoover's house. He believes

Miss Gandy had an inventory and a photograph of the items that were

taken from the Director's office.

The plaques that were packed by Brent Hughes were taken to FBI

storage space at either Taylor Street or the General Accounting Office

Building and these boxes were later moved to the Old Post Office Building

where they are presently located.

Peyton does not recall removing anything from Mr. Hoover's

house aiter the boxes were delivered there. Mi. Crawford was the care

taker of the house.

About this same time, Peyton recalls that he was asked by Miss

• Candy or Mrs: Skillman to take some boxes trom fir. 'L'oison's oitice.

There were about twenty-five to thirty boxes of items taken from Mr.

Tolson's office to Mr. Hoover's home and these boxes were placed in

an alcove near the stairway.

He has no recollection of moving any filing cabinets to Mr. Hoover's

house or seeing any file cabinets in the recreation room. The last time he

was at Mr. Hoover's house was shordy aiter the death of Mr. Hoover and

after the boxes were moved in.

He moved nothing from the Director's office to Mr. Felt's office.

He does recall that Vir. Felt brought in about six - eight 2-drawer, safe-

type cabinets for his office as Peyton had to make a base for these cabinets.

F. Thomas Peyton, Visual Information Specialist, Exhibits

Section, Administrative Division, Federal Bureau of Investigation,

furnished the following information:

He believes the day following former Director J. Edgar Hoover's

death on 5/2/72 he was contacted by Miss Fielen W. Gandy, Vir. Hoover's

Executive Assistant, wherein she requested help in packing certain items

in Mr. Hoover's office. Shortly thereafter he met Miss Candy in the

conference room of the Director's suite. She pointed out items to him

which were to be packed in cardboard boxes. These items could be

described as memorabilia and when asked for examples he said he

recalled a black pearl iniaid pen desk set and ashtray which were on the

large conference table. He did not receive any instructions from her

on how this material was to be packed but believes she did instruct him

to list the contents of each box packed. She then went back to her own

office and he callea his oftice to arrange for personnel to assist in the

pacising. Shortly thereafter three us four individuais from the Extivis

Section came up and the packing commenced.

He cannot recall specific identities of individuals involved; how

ever, stated that the following persons, to the best of his recollection,

were at one time or other involved in packing material in the Director's

suite: Brent Hughes, Frederick Larson, Robert O'äaver, William

Flaherty (now decreased), William Berry (retired), John Carpenter

(former employee), Raymond Schaeffer, William Nash, Wayne For,

Laurence Massie, Edward Ryan, James Boock, Kenneth Peffer, and

IVelvain Lovelace.

He said the packing material utilized was from the Exhibits

Section and the cardboard boxes were obtained from the Mechanical

Section. The boxes were generally the same size, estimated to be

18" by 24"' by 18". However, some larger and some smaller boxes

were used depending on the size of the material to be packed.

He recalled that everything in the conference room was packed

with the exception of 60 to 80 law books that were in bookcases. Personnel

from the library of the FBI Academy at Guantico, Virginia, probably

removed these books and he assumed they went to Quantico.

As the boxes were packed they were taped shut and stacked in

the conference room. In addition to packing material in the conference

room, personnel from the Exhibits Section also packed plaques, certifi-

cates, awards, etc., which were located on the walls of the hallway

leading from the reception room to the conference room. These personnel

also assisted Mechanical Section personnel in packing material in the

reception room such as trophies, plaques showing the names of Agents

killed in the line of duty and FBI personnel killed during World War II.

They also assisted in packing material maintained in a room adjoining

the telephone room of the Director's suite which consisted of editorials,

newspaper clippings, etc.

Approximately one day aitor they had commenced packing Miss

Gandy asked him to see if he could arrange to get these boxes out to

Mr. Hoover's house and they then started moving some of the boxes out

to the house while the packing was still in progress. He is unable to recall

whether personnel from the Exhibits Section or the Mechanical Section or

a combination of both hauled the boxes from the Director's suite to the

truck at the loading dock in the Justice Department Building. He recalls

that they used "whatever trucks the Mechanical Section had" to haul the

boxes and also may have utilized a stationwagon assigned to the Exhibits

Section for hauling. He estimated that three to four trips were made to

Hoover's house over roughly a week's time with the material. He is

unable to recall if there were any times when more than one trip a day

to the house was made.

The first time he was at Hoover's house after 5/2/72 was probably

within the week of Mr. Hoover's death; however, he can't fix the specific

time.

He recalled that either Miss Gandy or Jack Dunpuy, the Section

Chief of the Exhibits Section, told him that furniture needed to be moved

out of the recreation room in Hoover's house and into the attic. He does

not recall being told the reason why it was necessary to move this

furniture. He went to the house with three or four employees of the

Mechanical Section and they moved the furniture, including a sofa, matching

chair, possibly a couple of tables and a coffee table from the recreation

room into the attic. He recalled that Miss Annie Fields, Mr. Hoover's

maid, told them where to place the furniture in the attic. He does not

recall that James Crawford, the caretaker at the house, was there. He

has no recollection of moving any cardboard boxes into the attic nor

does he recall whether or not there were any cardboard boxes in the

recreation room at the time.

He did remember that the many pictures

which had been on the walls of the recreation room were already removed

from the walls. He has no recollection of any file cabinets being in the

recreation room at this time. He said it is possible they may have taken

boxes previously packed in the office of Mr. Hoover out with them on

this occasion and placed them in the recreation room; however, he is

not sure of this. He can't be positive but thinks that Ray Smith was among

the Mechanical Section employees at the house on this occasion. He did

not recall seeing Miss Gandy or Vir. Clyde A. Tolson, former Associate

Director.

He has no speciüc recoliection of the sequence of trips oui io

the house, hauling material, but recalled that when they started bringing

the boxes into the recreation room they stacked them against the wall which

would have been at the back of the house. They were stacked almost to

the ceiling but he did not think they covered the entire length of the wall.

He believed Miss Gandy had instrucied these boxes be placed in that

particular location. He recalled that they had taken some boxes from

the room in back of the telephone room in the Director's suite which

Miss Gandy had instructed be staded in front of the fireplace in the

recreation room. He recalled these were boxes containing such things

as newspaper clippings and were in boxes larger than the ones normally

used by the Exhibits Section in packing the material. Inasmuch as the

boxes were heavy they were not completely filled and as a result when

they stacked them they had a tendency to sag. He remembers telling

Miss Gandy about this either at the house or in her office and she told

him to continue stacking them in that manner. He remembered that the

next time he went to the house James Crawford told him that these boxes

had tipped over and broken a floor lamp in the recreation room. He

believes that this conversation with Crawford regarding the lamp was the

last time that he was at Mr. Hoover's house in connection with moving

material.

He has a recollection of bringing office supplies out to Miss Gandy

at the house at some time but can recall no further specifics in that regard.

He does recall Miss Gandy being present at some time while he

was at the house in connection with moving material into it but cannot

specity when this was.

He has no recollection of participating in the transportation of

any filing cabinets to Vir. Hoover's house; however, he does recall moving

some "heavy stuff" other than boxes into the house or of seeing this done.

He has a definite recollection of having to place one filing cabinet on top

of another in the corner of the recreation room. He believes four file

cabinets were involved, two on top of the other two. He does not know

where these file cabinets came from but to the best of his recollection

he did not see them the first time he was in the recreation room after

Mr. Hoover's death. He recalls a conversation with Miss Gandy at the

house regarding these file cabinets. He thinks these file cabinets had

come from Miss Gandy's vifice where they had been enclosed in & wooden

cabinet with sliding doors. It was his recollection Miss Gandy wanted

this wooden cabinet put over the filing cabinets in the same fashion as it

was in her office; however, Peyton determined this was noi feasible

because of the manner in which the wooden cabinet was constructed and

secured to the wall. He has a recollection this conversation with Miss

Gandy took place while she was standing on the stairs leading from the

inside of the house to the recreation room.

He said there may have been two other filing cabinets in the bar

area of the basement but he cannot be sure of this.

He is positive that at no time after Mr. Hoover's death did he

observe 20 to 25 file cabinets in the recreation room and the only file

cabinets he recalls are those he has described.

He recalls that in connection with moving stuff into Mr. Hoover's

house he would on some occasions ride out with other personnel in the

truck hauling the material and other times would go out to the house in the

stationwagon accompanied by others and they would meet the truck at

Hoover's house and assist in unloading it.

He recalls Ray Smith being at the house during the moving process

but he can't say when .

The only women he recalls seeing at the house were Miss Gandy

and Miss Annie Fields.

In addition to moving Mr. Hoover's'effects to his house, he recalls

that auring the same period he was told that there was some stuff in

Mr. Tolson's office which was to be taken out to the house. He recalls

going to Mr. Tolson's office where he talled to Tolson's Administrative

Assistant, Mrs. Dorothy Skillman. She asked him if some caraboard

boxes which she pointed out could be taken out to the house. There were

approximately 20 of these boxes in the area of the bookcase opposite the

window in the personal office of Mr. Tolson. There were another two

or three boxes in the little alcove just off Mrs. Skillman's office.

He

made the necessary arrangements to have these boxes moved out to the

house but he does not recall who moved the boxes from Tolson's office.

He does recall being at Hoover's house when they were unloaded and

remembers that they were stacked in a corner of what had been the bar

area in the basement. He specifically recalls that James Crawford was

present at the house at that time. he does not know what these hoxes

contained as he recalls they were taped shut. It was his recollection

either Mrs. Skillman or Miss Gandy had told him where these boxes were

to be placed prior to transporting them to the house. He knows of no

file cabinets being moved from Mr. Tolson's office to Hoover's house

or elsewhere.

He did not participate in any manner and has no knowledge of

the packing or moving of the personal effects of Mr. Tolson after Mr.

Tolson's death in 1975.

Other than described above, he has no information regarding

the packing or moving of anything to Mr. Hoover's house or else where

subsequent to the death of Mi. Hoover.

Kenneth Lee Peffer, Exhibits Specialist - General, Administrative Division,

Federal Bureau of Investigation, home address, Box 294, Berryville, Virginia,

telephone number 703~955-1089, telephonically furnished the following information:

He has been employed by the FBI since January, 1963, and was employed in

the Exhibits Section on 5/2/72, the day Director Itoover

died.

He was told by Tom

Peyton, Exhibits Jection, to go to the Director's Cifice to pack plaques, pictures

and other personal items. He believed he started this packing the day after Mr.

Hoover died and did this work for about three days. He worked with Melvin Lovelace

and perhaps Larry Massie. Fle believes Tom Peyton was also present during this

time.

Miss Gandy or Tom Peyton gave him his instructions as to which items were

to be taken. The items were wrapped in corrugated paper, placed in boxes and the

boxes were sealed with tape. He made a list of the iteins in each box and taped the

list to the box. Large items were removed to the Exhibits Section, Room B-418,

Justice Building, and crated. Some of the sealed cartons were taken to the loading

dock and placed on a truck to be taken to Mr. Hoover's house. He recalls that about

50 cartons were taken to the house and the cartons were about 12' & 18" x 30". He

believes he went out to the house twice and on one of those timos he wont with Tom

Peyton, Ray Smith and Melvin Lovelace. He moved cartons into the basement

recreation room. There were other boxes in the recreation room on his first trip

there and there were possibly as many boxes in the room as he was delivering at

that time. He has not been back to Mr. Hoover's house since that time and has

never removed anything from the house. He did not pack any files, records or other

documents and does not know of any such records being removed from the Director's

Office or taken to Vir. Hoover's house. He does not recall moving anything from

Mr. Tolson's office.

Kenneth Lee Peffer, Exhibits Specialist, Exhibits Section,

Administrative Division, Federal Bureau of Investigation, furnished

the following information:

Shortly after the death of former Director J. Edgar Hoover on

5/2/72, he assisted for several days in packing items in the Director's

suite. At about the time the packing was finally completed he went to

Mr. Hoover's house to assist in moving to the house material which

they had previously packed. He knows he made at least one trip to Mr.

Hoover's house that day and possibly a second trip on the same day.

It is his recollection that on one trip he had helped load the "big blue

truck" with boxes at the Bureau's loading dock prior to going out to the

house. If he made two trips, which seems to be possible, he did not

assist in loading the truck on the second occasion.

He has a recollection of riding in the cab of the truck in the

miudle of the seat. He recalls this because he does not like to sit in

the middle and further this was the first occasion he had ridden in the

truck. Fe is "pretty sure" that Melvain Lovelace, a fellow employee

in the Exhibits section, was also in the truck and is "positive" that

Raymond Smith was the driver. He also is positive that Tom Peyton

was at the house but he cannot recall it Peyton went with them on the

truck or met them at the house.

He recalls that Annie Fields, James Crawford and Miss Helen

Gandy were at the house on this occasion. He can recall Miss Gandy

standing at the foot of the stairs talking to Tom Peyton. It is his recol-

lection that the truck was full but he cannot specifically recall whether

or not there were file cabinets as part of the load. He does know that

he helped unload and move into the louse some file cabinets that day.

He had a specific recollection that while they were packing

material earlier in Vr. Hoover's suite he assisted in plaeing two "short"

file cabinets onto a "dolly". These cabinets were losated in Miss Gandy's

office. Melvain Lovelace was the one helping him and he assumes that

they were taken on the dolly down to the truck and loaded; however, he did

not do this hirself. His best recollection was that the file cabinets were

on the truck which he helped load. He recalled that when they got to Mr.

Hoover's house they had a hard time getting the cabinets down the steps

and into the basement because of trouble in getting by a washer and dryer

located immediately behind the basement door. He also recalls having to

list the two file cabinets in order to place them on top of two other file

cabinets in a corner of the recreation room. He recalls this because when

Tom Peyton told them this had to be done he and Lovelace laughed about

it and one of them said "you've got to be kidding" because it was a very

difficult job due to the weight of the cabinets. He does not recall whether

the two cabinets on the bottom were part of the load taken out or whether

they were already in place when they go there. He has no recollection

of any other file cabinets in the recreation room. He recalls there were

cardboard boxes in the room when they got there and he recalls that the

boxes they unloaded from the truck were stacked in the recreation room

almost to the ceiling.

He has a recollection of returning downtown very close io 4:30

p.m. the day he was at Hoover's house. He fixes this time because he

has a recollection of concern that he was going to miss his car pool

which normally leaves at 4:30 p.m. This leads him to believe that he

probably made two trips to the house that day, once in the moring,

possibly returning about noontime and then going out to unload another

load in the afternoon. It is his recollection that he would have ridden in

the truck on both occasions.

He was the only white male actually participating in the unloading

of material from the trucks. While Tom Peyton is white he did not

physically participate in the unloading but acted more in a supervisory

capacity.

At that time he knew Raymond Smith only casually since they

were working in different sections and doubted if Smith would have known

him by name.

the cardboard boxes contained as it is his recollection that there were no markings on

boxes.

He said he may have taken some wooden crates on one of these trips to Mr.

Hoover's former residence but does not know what these crates contained. He was

assisted in transporting this material to Mr. Hoover's former residence by another.

• Mechanical Section employee named Raymond Smith. He could not estimate the number

uf ca ruboard voxes or crates which he delivered iu Mr. Fuuver's furmes residence

furnished the following information:

A week or so following the death of former Director J. Edgar

Hoover on 5/2/72 he recalls assisting Raymond Smith, also of the

Mechanical Section, in transporting two safe-type file cabinets to

Mr. Hoover's home. He has a vague recollection that these cabinets

were placed on some type of platform in the recreation room of

Mr. Hoover's home. He believes they may have been placed along a

wall closest to the alley. When these file cabinets were delivered he

recalled seeing other file cabinets in the recreation area which he

believed to be legal sized; however, he cannot recall the color of

these cabinets. It was his recollection that some of these cabinets

were located next to a wall closest to the alley and some may have

been located along a wall nearest the front of the house. He does

not recall the number of file cabinets involved bue estimated that

there could have been 6 to 10.

He recalled no conversation with Raymond Smith regarding

the file cabinets and he has no information as to who may have delivered

these file cabinets to Mr. Hoover's residence. At no time has he ever

removed any file cabinets from Mr. Hoover's residence.

He recalls going to Mr. Hoover's house 6 to 8 months ago to

pick up approximately 30 cardboard boxes of books which he sub-

Special Agent Clark & Shoalt advised that the I. Edgar Hoover

Foundation, through tit. Louis E. Mebole, Ureaident and Director of tala

Forntation, offered the personal library of J. Esgar Hoover to the FLI

Recrestional Association for use at the EDI Academy at Juantico, Virginia.

This offer was accepted and a letter was sest to dir. Nichola, dated 7/31/74.

from the Foundation

It is my recollection that ampronimately iwo to three weeks after

this letter was sent, the books were delivezed to the f'EL Academy Library.

At that tine, there were approximately 1, 000 booke which were rarenalis

reviawed by me and placed on shelves for storage in the basement of the

Kenneth Shaffer, Assistart Chief Clerk, Washingion Field Office,

Washington, D. C, furnished the following intormation:

He has been Assistant Chief Clerk since 1970. Shortly after the death

of former Director J. Edgar Hoover on 5/2/72, someone in the Office of former

Director Hoover made arrangements With then Special Agent in Charge Robert G.

Kunkel of the Washington Field Otfice to have confidential trash picked up from

Mr. Hoover's Office to be taken to the Washington Field Citice for destruction.

Shaffer went to Hoover's Office on approximately three occasions with SA Joseph E.

Battle of Washington Field Office where they picked up sealed boxes of material,

placed them in a Bureau automobile, transported them to the Washington Field

Office and placed them in a locked room on the fourth floor. The contents were then

destroyed in a Security Engineered Machine Company Disintegrator. He described

this as a machine which chops paper extremely fine, forces it through a screen

and into a plastic bag. This machine is very noisy and, therefore, it was only

operated at night. He and Chief Clerk Thomas Barden Dudney of Washington Field

Office handled the disintegration of this material, sometimes together and sometimes

separately. He estimated that this took place over a period of six to seven days. te

said the cardboard boxes varied in size but generally were approximately 20" by 20"

by 30". He estimated that there were a total of 12 to 15 boxes of material destroyed.

When asked to describe the nature of the material being destroyed, he said he recalled

seeing old photos of Hoover, postcards, invitations for White House functions, Hoover's

Christmas card list, financial statements regarding Hoover's stockholdings, bank

statements, old 'Investigator" magazines and envelopes. Most of the material had

holes punched in it as though it had been in a bound file and much of the material

was torn in hali when he first observed it. He never saw anything in this material

that appeared to be from official Bureau files.

He knew that some of this material came from Hoover's house as he had

been told that SA Battle had picked it up from the house. Shaffer himself has never

been to Hoover's house and other than described he never removed anything from

Hoover's Office subsequent to Mr. Hoover's death.

Mrs. Dorothy Skillman, 429 N Street, Southwest, Apartment

$ 700, Washington, D. C., telephone 551-1217, was interviewed at the

residence of former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and furnished the

following information:

To the lest of her recollection, the first time she was at the

residence of former FBI Director Hoover after his death was on 6/14/72.

She was basing this on the fact that she had retired from her employment

with the F'Bi on 6/12/72. At that time Mr. Clyde A. Tolson, who had

been the Associate Director of the FBI and for whom she had worked was

then living in Mir. Hoover's residence. She came out there during the

day to help Mr. Tolson with his personal affairs. She worked at a desk

in the recreation room in the basement of the home. Miss Helen W.

Gandy was also at the house working in the recreation room on the

personal affairs of Mr. Hoover.

When she arrived the first time at the house there were oniy six.

filing cabinets in the basement area. These are still there and consist

of two & drawer and two 3-drawer brown cabinets which currently con-

tain material pertaining to Mr. Hover's personal affairs such as old

income tax records and oil well investment data. In addition to these

and separated from them in the basement area are one 2-drawer and

one f-drawer file cabinet, each brown in color. These are situated in

what was the former bar area of the basement and contain material

pertaining to the personal affairs of Mr. Tolson such as his oil well

investments as well as some otfice supplies. These latter two cabinets

were at the house in their present location, empty, when she first

arrived there. She had earlier packed the material now contained

therein at the office of Mr. Tolson at FBI Headquarters. This material

had been maintained in file cabinets in his office. It had been taken to

the residence in cardboard boxes and she personally transferred the

material to these two filing cabinets at the residence.

With the exception of the above-described six filing cabinets she

knows of no other cabinets that were brought to Mr. Hoover's residence

after Mr. Hoover's death and is positive she never has seen more than

those six in the basement area of his home.

She recalled that there were no file cabinets maintained in the

oifice physically occupied by Mr. Tolson at F'BI Headquarters. She

stated that her office was immediately outside of his and it was her

recollection she had eight to ten &-drawer file cabinets, probably gray

in color, in her office. These cabinets contained "all his personal

stuff." Aiter Mr. Tolson left the FBI she went through this material,

packing some of it in cardboard boxes as mentioned earlier to be

transported to Mr. Hoover's home and some of it was old material

she destroyed in the office. She was very specific that there were no

official Bureau documents or other material included in that which she

destroyed or which was moved to Mr. Hoover's home. She was also

specific in recalling that the eight to ten 2-drawer file cabinets were

left in their normal location after she had emptied the contents and when

she leit ize FBi.

She has no knowledge as to where the six filing cabinets currently

maintained in the basement area of Mr. Hoover's home originated or who

brought them to the residence.

Faymond Smith, 4936 Nasa Street, Apartment 10, Washington, D. C.,

telephone 398-5665, was interviewed by Special Agents Joseph I. Henehan and

Fred B. Griffith and furnished the following information:

He has been employed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for 17

years and is currently employed as a mechanic at the FBI Acalemy, Quantico,

Virginia.

At the time of the death of 3. Edgar Hoover, he was employed as a

driver in the Mechanical Section of the Administrative Division. He drove

the big blue stake body truck. Shortly after the death of Mr. Hoover, he would

estimate to be probably "a couple days" after the death, he made two trips to

the Director's home from the Justice Building carrying 20 or more file cabinets

to Mr. Hoover's house. As he recalls his truck was loaded when he arrived

in the morning and he opened the truck up and noticed that it was almost filled

with four or five-drawer brown metal file cabinets. He went in and advised the

"front office" of the Mechanical Section that he would need help with the load

ào hê coulể not move the file cabinets by himself. He does not recall iu whom

he spoke but he seems to recall that he was told there would be help at Mr.

Hoover's house to untoad the truck. He thereafter drove the truck to Mr.

Hoover's house and unloaded the file cabinets into the basement recreation

room. He made two trips each beginning the first thing in the morning with

his truck being loaded by someone else the prior evening. He recalled that on

one occasion at Vir. Hoover's house Miss Gandy, Mr. Hoover's former

Executive Assistant, was present and she told him to line the file cabinets up

against one wall in the recreation room.

He believes that Miss Holmes, who was formerly employed in the

Director's Office, may also have been there on one of the occasions when he

brought the file cabinets but he was not sure. During the period aiter Mr.

Hoover's death he made at least four or five trips carrying materials from

the Justice Building to the house. He moved boxes, plaques and other

miscellaneous items and it was his understanding that all the items moved

were the personal belongings of Mi. Hoover.

During the same period he also worked several days at Mr. Hoover's

• house moving various items about the house and assisting in the assembly of

materials being brought in.

Vir. James Crawford supervised his activities for the work he per

formed in Mr. Hoover's house moving various pieces of furniture and items

brought to the house. le has no recollection of ever moving any materials •

out of Mr. Hoover's home anywhere and he has not been at Mr. Hoover's

house in the immediate past nor since Mr. Tolson's death. He has no recol-

lection of moving any materials from Mr. Hoover's office to the office of the

former Assistant Director - Deputy Associate Director W. Mark Felt.

Mr. Smith was reinterviewed on 6/12 by SAsJoseph E. Henehan and

Fred B. Griffith and furnished the following information:

He recalls that he did move approximately 20 file cabinets which were

brown four or five-drawer letter size from the Justice Building to Mr. Hoover's

house. Lie has no idea where these file cabinets came from as they were loaded

onto his truck by someone else. As he previously stated, the truck was already

loaded when he reported to work in the morning by unknown individuals and he

was instructed to drive the truck and unload it at Mr. Hoover's house. He made

two trips with the file cabineis on two difierent days, both of these trips being

the first trip he made on each day. He used a stevedore device to roll the file

cabinets into Mr. Hoover's house. lie recalled that he had help at the house

in getting the file cabinets down to the recreation room but he is unable to

recall who helped him. He knows it was not the laborers who worked with him

in the Mechanical Section of the Administrative Division. He recalled that he

went in the back door of the house up through the kitchen down the hallway and

down the basement stairs with each of the estimated 20 file cabinets. He

recalled that when he first went into the recreation room with the first cabinet

he was surprised as everything had been removed from the walls which made

the room look quite different than it had been in the past with the numerous

versonal items which had been on the walls. The file cabinets were heavy and he

had difficulty moving them down the basement steps and he had assistance

but does not recall who helped him. He received instructions from Miss Gandy

as to where to line the cabinets up and he lined them up in a lineup against the

wall, in the front part of the room whereas the cardonard boxes being stored

were stacked in the back of the room.

He recalled during this same time there were one or two safe-type

two-drawer file cabinets that he assisted in putting on stands in the recreation

room, which stands were similar to those made by the Exhibits Section of

the FBI. When the file cabinets were all in the recreation room they were

aligned side by side along the side wall.

fle was unable to recall who told him to take the truck to Mr.

Hoover's house with the cabinets but it must have been either of his bosses

Vir. Marsden, Mr. Gregory or Mi. Brennan.

In addition to the file cabinets he made other trips to Mr. Hoover's

house carrying sealed boxes and other materials. He recalled that on one

trip that Jessie Petersen was with him.

He is not aware of any specific items he moved as he did not look

in the file cabinets and recalls no markings on them and most other items

delivered were in sealed boxes.

Be stated that his memory is a little "fuzzy" and the aforementioned

is as best as he can recall. He advised he does not thinks he has confused

the above with any other assignments when he may have moved items to

Vir. Hoover's home or other locations. He could not recall any specific

individual who was involved with the movement of the aforementioned cabinets.

Raymond Smith, 4936 Nasa Street, Apartment 10, Washington, D. C.,

employed as a mechanic at the FBI Academy, Quantico, Virginia, furnished the

following information:

In May, 1972, he was employed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation

as a driver assigned to the Mecharical Section. He ordinarily drove a Bureau Ford

truck, blue in color, with a completely enclosed body.

One or two days after the death of 3. Edgar Hoover on 5/2/72, Smith

reported for work as usual at approximately 8:00 a.m. He observed that the blue

truck appeared to be "sitting low" indicating that it was loaded. Since he had left

the truck the previous evening unloaded, he investigated and found that the truck was

fully loaded with file cabinets. As he had no prior information as to what was to be

done with the load, he contacted someone in a supervisory capacity to ascertain

what was to be done with them. He could not recall who he contacted but said it

had to be either Anthony Codi, his immediate superior, or Bob Marsden, Supervisor;

Mechanical Section. He recalled being instructed by either Codi or Marsden to

drive the truck to Mr. Hoover's former residence where someone would meet

him to help him unload the truck. Usually in situations such as this personnel from

the Mechanical Section would assist him in loading and unloading. He drove the

truck to the house and parked in the driveway along side the house. He was

assisted in the unloading by two young white males who he did not know. They took the

file cabinets from the back of the truck and carried them down the steps into the

recreation room where they were placed along the wall at the front of the room.

He recalls there were cardboard boxes between the file cabinets and the wall. He

said Miss Helen W. Gandy, Mr. Hoover's Executive Assistant, was there and told

him where to put the cabinets.

He described these cabinets as brown, legal-size, 4- or 5-drawer. He

recalled that when he was unloading one of the cabinets it nearly tipped over on

him and a drawer came open. He observed this drawer was filled with what

appeared to him to be folders, light in color, each roughly one inch in thickness.

He was of the opinion that all of the cabinets were filled inasmuch as they were very

heavy.

He could not specifically recall the number of cabinets but said they

completely filled the truck.

He recalled that in addition to Miss Candy there were tvo white women

present at the house whom he did not know plus several other persons also uninown

to him.

He believes that on the following day he drove the same truck to Mr.

Hoover's former residence and is of the opinion that he delivered come additional

file cabinets as well as some cardboard boxes. He did not recall receiving any

specific instructions regarding this trip but secalls he was again assisted in

unloading the cabinets at Mr. Hoover's former residence by two white males;

however, he could not be sure they were the same individuals who assisted

him on the previous trip. He was unable to specity the number of file cabinets

delivered on the second occasion; however, he estimated he delivered a total

of 20 to 25 cabinets.

He also recalled a subsequent trip to Mr. Hoover's house when he

and Jesse Peterson, Mechanical Section employee, delivered two safe-type

file cabinets and put them in the recreation room of Nr. hoover's house. E

was his recollection that on that occasion he observed in the recreation room

some oi the cabinets he had delivered earlier.

The last occasion, approximately a week later, which would be somewhere

between one and two weeks since Mr. Hoover's death, he was again at Mr. Hoover's

residence assisting in moving cardboard boxes from the recreation room to

the attic of the house.

On that occasion he did not observe any of the 20 to 25

file cabinets he had delivered earlier. He has no information as to where these

cabinets went and he personally did not move any cabinets out of Mr. Hoover's

house.

He said as far as he knew there was no written record regarding the

trips made to Mr. Hoover's residence.

when he was Assistant Director - Deputy Associate Director, until June, 1973, when

he retired from the Bureau. At the time of his retirement he was the Acting

Associate Director oi the FBi.

During the period 1961 or 1962 she was a substitute in the Office of former

Director J. E. Hoover but could furnish no information concerning any official -

confidential files which may have been maintained in Mr. Hoover's Ofticeduring

that period. She recalled that someone mentioned the fact that a file was maintained

in Mr. Hoover's Office on John F. Kennedy; however, she never saw this file and

does not know where it was maintained.

Following Mr. Hoover's death on 5/2/72 she recalls Mr. Felt mentioning

that there would be some file cabinets coming to his oftice and indicated that Miss

Helen W. Candy had told him some material would be coming.. to his otice from

former Director Hoover's Office. She cannot recall specifically when this was;

however, it was sometime before Miss Gandy retired from the Bureau on 5/12/72.

As she recalls two 4-drawer gray safe-type cabinets were ordered to

accommodate the material which was to later come from Mr. Hoover's Office.

When

these cabinets arrived they were placed in Mr. Felts Office. She does not have

anyway of knowing when the material was delivered from Vir. Hoover's Office to

Mr. Felt's office, but to the best of her recollection about six cardboard boxes were

delivered to Mir. Felt's office from Mr. Hoover's Office and the material contained

that material formerly maintained in the Cafice of Director Hoover. She said

this folder was naintained by her in a cabinet in kir. Felt's office. She was not

able to identity all the material contained therein as material she had seen in the

past but did fnrnish the following intormation concerning the contents with which

she was familiar.

Document captloned "Index of Material, Cabinets 1 - 6, Mr. Felt's

Oliice" was the original inventory prepared by Neil Suliivan of all the material:

contained in the six 2-drawer safe-type cabinets in Mr. Felt's office.. She noted

that as other enterial was anded to the drawers in the six cabinets she would insert

a description of the new material on the bulllian inventory or index. She specifically

recalled adding such captions as "Bridges, larry - Atridavita, " "Defochemont,

Louis - hilidavits re 'Crime of the Century'" Television Series "The FBI

agreement" and othere.

The singie sheet of paper captioned "Contenta Cabinet 1" attached to file

'The Xerox copy of a single sheet of paper bearing the handwritten

notations captioned "Section I" is familiar to her and the handwriting thereon

in ink and peneil is hers; however, she cannot recall why she had it os what

it pertained to.

The two lists, one numerical by file number and the other alphabetical,

captioned "Index of Material, Cabinets 1- 6, Mr. Felt's Office" were prepared

at her request by Neil Sullivan who had previously inventoried this material.

These were all official Bureau files that were serialized and quite often someone

from the Files and Communications Division would call her asking for a certain

file number so that they could review material in those files. It was difficult

to readily locate the proper ille so she asked Neil Sullivan to prepare the lists.

She thought this was probably done several months aiter he made the original

inventory. She also noted that as other files were added the additional data was

typed onto the existing lists.

assignment and not physically located at FBI Headquarters. A few days thereaiter he

recalls delivering a van-type truckload of sealed cardboard boxes to the residence of

former Director Hoover.

These boxes were picked up from the loading platform in the

Department of Instico Building and he has no way of knowing who placed these cartons

on ine icading platform. He has no knowledge as to the identity of the persons who

packed these cartons and boxes; however, he packed no material in former Director's

no inventory ; maintained of these boxes.

When he arrived at Mr. Hoover's former residence he believes that Miss
