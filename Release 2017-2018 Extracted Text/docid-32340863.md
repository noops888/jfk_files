Memorandun for A. H. Belmont

Re: sad 635-5

(Juan Fernandez de Castro Rodriguez)

134-5991

By cable 7/3/59 Legal Attache, Havana, was

alerted to

possibility informant may have been arrested and was told to

furnish any data received but to make no open inquiry which might

jeopardize informant or compromise Legal Attache himself. Legal

Attache cable 7/6/59 advised no data received.

• Miami teletype 7/8/59 advises of call from "McFarlane"

(whose identity is unknown but who is apparently acquainted with

informant) who said he had message from uncle of informant to

effect "Joe is still behind bars."

"Joe" is code name of informant

and it would appear informant is definitely under arrest by castro

Goverment.

Although informant is probably under arrest, it seems

Iclear he has not revealed his relationship with FBI as we would

probably have heard a loud blast from Castro by now. Informant

recognized his precarious position in acting as informant and

presumably he will not reveal his cooperation with FBI although

there is no guarantee what any man will do under pressure of

interrogation or in fear of his life. Presumably, he would not

do so except under most extreme circumstances for it would only

aggravate his predicament. Obviously, his present arrest stems

from his alignment with Cuban Air Force rather than his informant

statuso

He entered Cuban Air Force on his sun initiative ano

recognized dangers of alignment with Diaz brothers.

Fact that he

was in cuba and working with us was risk he assuned and ue, in

turn, had to assume risk of exposure or loss in return for valuat!!

data on a critical situation.

It is not believed we can or should do anything it this

time to intercede for him.

such intercession would only

compromise him and aggravate situation for him. If we are later

faced with charges by Castro or inquiries from press that he

admies working with t'BI, we are simply going to have to withhoi:

comment as to confirm it would not help him or us.

At same

tilled

he has been trustworthy informant and we should assist if

opportunity presents itself and if it can be done without

jeopardizing Legal Attache operation.

For example,

if Fernande:.

should get free on bond,

escapes, or charges are dismissed and it

seets assistance of Legal attache in coming to U.So, it is believed

we should examine circumstances at that time and decide what, if

anything, can reasonably be done.
