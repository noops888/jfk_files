On the afternoon of 3/21/61, -MM-722-C telephonically

advised he was under the impression MEROLA may have pulled:

this score and should be considered a suspect. He based

this on the fact that MEROLA had previously mentioned to

him the valuable jewelry these individuals owned and how

nice it would be to get It. He also based this on the fact

that he had heard MEROLA was frequenting Gulfstream Race

Track, which is directly across from the restaurant run by

Victims.

Subsequently M1-722-C advised SA PRUE C.

CLINKSCALES that he was convinced MEROLA had "his two boys"

jewelry. He had learned this from MEL ADLER, a close friend

of MEROLA and the informant. Informant advised SA CLINKSCALES

that MEROLA had sold two pieces for approximately $10,000

to a looal Individual and had offered a big piece for sale

to SAMKAY, & Miami Beach racketeer millionaire.

FLA.

Also di Interest in this matter, MM-722-c had

earlier advised that he believed MEROLA's "two boys" were

the individuals responsible for a number of kidnapings of

well-to-do individuals which had occurred on the Beach.

These kidnapings consisted of the forcible taking of individuals

and shaking them down for a sum of money. One such incident

was reported to the Bureau by Miami teletype of 1/11/61

captioned UNSUBS (2); HENRY HARVEY HERMAN - VICIIM; KIDNAPING.

This Individual was abducted at a stop light, was not trans-

ported interstate and was released unharmed with the promise

that he would later pay his abductors the money demanded.

No federal violation was involved since no interstate

transportation.

Information has been received re similar

kidnapings handled in the same manner but Victims reportedly

Involved had refused to make an official complaint to police

agencies.

On the night of 4/3/61, pursuant to a specific

request, MM-722-C telephonically contacted Supervisor

SWINNEY. He was asked to furnish all information concerning

MEROLA's possible participation in this loss and was advised

that information he had previously given to SA CLINKSCALES

was known to SA SWINNEY.

He was told it was absolutely

necessary to determine

from whom he had obtained this infor-

mation and the complete details.

MM-722-C advised he had learned from MEL ADLER

that MEROLA had sold two pieces of jewelry immediately following

instant loss to a local individual in order to get money for

MEROLA's "two boys" to get out of town until things cooled off.

He also advised that _CHARLES PELMONICO, son Of Top Hoodlum

CHARLIE "THE BLADE" TOURINE,

had told him, MM-722-C, he had

recently purchased two pieces of jewelry from MEROLA for

$7,500 in order for MEROLA to get money to get lin boys out

town until things cooled off.

MM-722-C also advised MEROLA had in his possession

a gun with a silencer and it is noted a silencer equipped gun

was used in instant robbery.

In view of the foregoing information, it was

considered desirable to interview MEROLA in an attempt to

resolve whether he was implicated in this violation.

Accordingly, SA SWINNEY telephonically contacted him,

requesting that he come to the Miami office on the morning

of 4/5/61. He appeared voluntarily as requested and was

interviewed by SA SWINNEY out of the presence of any other

personnel since it was felt he would be more likely to

admit any implication on his part under these conditions.
