MARINO sold some land he owned in Las Vegas and

some land he owned in Kenner, La.

This raised $50,000.

MaRINo put down this 550,000 for a tract of land "on the

highway to Boulder City" in Las Vegas, Nevada. MARINO shoul

put up $50,000 more by 5/1/67 to complete this deal. At the

very latest, MARINO can wait until 5/17/67 and if he does not

put up $50,000 more. by then, he loses his $50,000.

CARLOS MARCELLO at first was willing to give MARINO

$100,000 allowing MARINO to pay his $50,000 debt and pocket

the remaining $50,000. CARLOS MARCELLO would then own this

deal.

After negotiations with CARLOS MARCELLO, MARINO found

out that CARLOS MARCELLO would meet MARINO's deal only if

CARLOS MARCELLO gets exclusive control of the gambling

concession at this new hotel or motel. MARINO does not want

to give this concession to MARCELLO, therefore, negotiations

are

at a standstill.

Informant stated that MARINO is very

perturbed at CARLOS MARCELLO's attitude.

Informant stated that MARINO was originally the

maitre d' at the Beverly Club in New Orleans when it was owned

and operated by FRANK COSTELLO and CARLOS MARCELLO. Upon the

closing of the Beverly Club, MARINO moved to Las Vegas.

Informant stated MARINO wears hearing aids. MARINO's

wife GLADYS was once in a convent, however, she had to leave

due to poor eyesight.

MARINO will leave New Orleans during
