she indicated she had already requested his help but

so far nothing had come of it.

advice as to what measures he could take to elude or

such action on the part of the subject would discourage

the surveilling agents.

anything at the present time. He advised that he has

met with the subject on at least three occasions during

the past few months but said the reason for these meetings

was of a personal nature and would be of no interest to the

FBI.

the subject is involved in any bookie operations in the

Miami area but said he knows nothing about bolita or

numbers and therefore could not say whether the subject
