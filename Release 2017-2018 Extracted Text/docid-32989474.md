NEEDLEMAN then discussed with CHILDS the position

of the CP, USA as regards certain organizations.

mentioned having recently given (raised ?) $100.00 (possibly

to the Citizens Committee for Constitutional Liberties), not

knowing that MIRIAM FRIEDLANDER did not enjoy the support

On January 17, 1964, an anonymous source of the

NYO reported that JACK ROVINSKY wrote NEEDLEMAN an unsigned

letter dated January 5, 1964 (at Peking, China) acknowledging

receipt or a

communication from NEEDLEMAN dated December 10,

1963(7 (4)

ROVINSKY indicated that he ( and his family)

lexpected to leave China by the end of July or sometime in

August, 1964, although he had a two year leave of absence

(from Cuba, which under certain circumstances could be

extended to three years.

He stated that he had signed a

one year contract with

the Chinese) and that he pretty

much expected not to renew it.

Since he had leave of

absence, he thought he would like to have the experience

of working in another socialist country. ROVINSKY told

NEEDLEMAN that there was a fundamental

difference between

those who are "invited" to work in a given country, and

those that are not "invited" but come on their own. He

stated that this difference applied to the level of the

work, classification, and pay, and was not necessarily

predicated on individual capabilities. "or this reason,

RovInSkY said he would prefer to go to another country on

the basis of an "invitation."

ROVINSKY suggested that working in the Soviet

Union would probably provide the sharpest contrast, but

work in some other country might prove equally interesting.

He indicated that his wife had been teaching English on a

university

level, and that he had been working as an "expert"

equal English on p

from Spanish Into English. GU(U)

Early in January, 1964, NY T-2 reported that

NEEDLEMAN discussed with JOSEPH FEINSTEIN a memorandum

which SEMENOV and FEINSTEIN planned to dictate on January 6,

1964.

FEINSTEIN expected this dictation would be ready by

January 7 and that then NEEDLEMAN, or whoever was designated

seemed to take the attitude that the Amtorg tax case was a

joke.

He intimated that if SEMENOV could be considered

stupia, MALOV was twice as stupid. FEINSTEIN said he could

not figure out what they had in mind.

During the first few days of January, 1964, NY I-34

advised that WILLIAM I. STANDARD visited NEEDLEMAN's office

on January 2, 1964. NEEDLEMAN related that SEMENOV and his

wife had dropped in at the NEEDLEMAN apartment on New Year's

to the United Nations. NEEDLEMAN mentioned that SEMENOV

A few days later, NY I-1 advised that jOSEPHOROW

him and had complained that Amtorg was being discriminated

against by the Ireasury Department.

CROWN said he had

assured SEMENOV that such was not the case, and that this

copies of the tax repost and had thought of considering

the thirty

CROWN said he had advised against this procedure

inasmuch as Amtorg would probably have to request further

During

the early part of January, 1964, NY T-4

an item in "The New York Times" of January 9, 1963, which

reflected a boycott of all Soviet cargo by dockworkers on

the eastern seaboard.

TEACHERS UNION OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK

The 1942 report of the New York State Legislative

subcommittee investigating the Public Education System in

New York City (Rapp Coudert Committee), page 178, stated in

substance the following regarding the Teachers Union of the

City of New York (TU) :

"The history of the Communist movement in the

New York City school system is primarily the history of the

so-called Teachers Union of the City of New York, formerly

Local 5 of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and of

its subsidiary, the College Teachers Union, formerly Local

537 of the American Federation of Teachers, which was

founded by Local 5 in 1938."

The Communists began infil-

trating Local 5 in the 1920's and by 1935, were in complete

control. In 1941, AFT revoked the charters of Locals 5 and

537 on the grounds that these locals were under the

"control

of the Communist Party and had consistently engaged in prac-

tices inimical to democracy."

DI. ABRAHAM LEFKOWITZ Of the Teachers Guild, presently

deceased, advised in August, 1955, that after the revocation of

Tu's charter, it acted as an independent union until 1943, wher

It became affiliated with the state, County, and Municipal

According

to an article appearing in the "New

York World Telegram" of June 11, 1946, the State, county,

pages 3 and 4, reflects

that UPWA disbanded in February, 1953, after being expelled

from the CIO on charges of Communist domination.

The "Daily Worker," a former

daily newspaper which suspended publication January 13, 1958,

in its issue of February 16, 1953, page 2, column 5, noted

that Tu had announced it would henceforth

the UPWA.

WORKERS WORLD PARTY

On April 17, 1959, a confidential source advised

that on February 12, 1959, a Socialist Workers Party (SWP)

minority group, under

the leadership of National

Committee member, SAM BALLAN, split from the SWe.

The source stated that this minority group,

referred to as the Marcyites, alter many years of program and

policy differences on varied issues concerning tactics and

interpretation of political events, split from the SWP on

the grounds that the Party was liquidating itseli by

departing from the Marxist precepts of LEON TROTSKY and

retreating from the fight for the world socialist revolution.

The final issue which ultinately forced the split was the

minority's opposition to the SWe regroupment policy which

involved cooperation with the Communist Party (CP)

periphery - individuals characterized by the minority as

petty • bourgeois.

The minority program, according to the source,

advocates unconditional defense of the soviet Union and

has as its goal the building of a revolutionary party

with a complete proletarian orientation for the purpose

of overthrowing capitalism in the United States and

throughout the world.

On May 12, 1960, the source advised that this

minority group had chosen

the name Workers World Party.

rin May 6, 1963, a second confidential source

stated that the headquarters of the Workers World Party

were located at 46 West 2lst Street, New York, New York.

The SWP and the CP have been designated

pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

ADMINISTRATIVE (Cont'a)

No specific leads are set out concerning known

individuals with whom NEEDLEMAN had been in contact. When-

ever these persons appear to be engaged in activities that

seem to be consistent with activities peculiar to a Communist

apparatus, they are made the subjects of separate investiga-

tions. The results of these investigations are analyzed to

determine whether these individuals are engaged in any

clandestine activity in the intelligence or political fields.

In this manner, the NEEDLEMAN file operates as a control

file.
