brother SAM this date in regard to attending a viewing of

an unknown person.

ROCCO was unable to go on account of

his injury.

9/28/64

Source furnished no information except domestic

affairs of ROCCO SCAFIDI, other than the fact that he was

visited by an unknown male, apparently a relative of his.

9/29/64

ROCCO SCAFIDI made an outgaing call to "J.R."

(SA J. ROBERT PEARCE). He advised that he had been around

to sign some insurance papers; had visited 8th Street and

observed nobody; and had talked to his brother SAM for awhile.

TONY COPPOLA, SCAFIDI's employer, lost money at a crap game

the previous

Sunday. CHICKIE NARDUCCI won at the game.

He

talked of an address on Passyunk Avenue, Philadelphia (address

Of JACK WILLIAMS, aka) and said "there is a rumor going around

that they are pushing ANGE (BRUNO) to get PHIL (TESTA) out and

that everybody is asking ANGE is he sure PHIL is getting out."

It is noted that during the conversation source was

asked where he was calling from, and he advised he was calling

from his home but that no one was present.

He was telephonically

instructed not to use his home phone to contact the FBI Office.

On 9/30/64, in person, he was again strongly reminded not to use

his telephone to contact the Agents.

He was reminded

that his

wife should not have knowledge of his activity.

He said that

she did not know of his activities.

He said she thinks "j.R."

is a brother of his employer, TONY

COPPOLA.

Concerning the above-described call on 9/29/64, the

above took place:

ROCCO SCAFIDI:

I got to go out tomorrow (and callithat's

all).

What does it look like?

Good.

Got to go out tomorrow?

Yeah. I got to, HELENA-----I got to go

out.

What did he say?

Try to get something off him tonight but

it's too late now-----tomorrow------.

From the above, it could not definitely be deter-

mined if ROCCO SCAFIDI's wife has knowledge of his association

with the FBI. It appeared, however, that she was present during

the above-described phone call but it is noted that the FBI by

9/30/64

ROCCO SCAFIDI remained around his premises with no

pertinent activity.

10/1/64

An unknown woman visited the SCAFIDI household but

was out of range of

the source.

ROCCO SCAFIDI contacted GABE

(ROBERT GABRIEL, his attorney)

to inquire how he made out with

ROCCO's probation office.

(SCAFIDI later verified this conversa-

tion).

Attorney GABRIEL

advised SCAFIDI he could have his pro-

bation at Philadelphia dismissed for $200. SCAFIDI later talked
