being checked out for their effectiveness by DI. Edward M.

Gunn, three pilla were ultimately turned over to Sam for the:

mission. Neither TSD nor Dr. Guan w13 briefed on the altimate

Luse of the pills.

11. Joe delivered the pills to Orta. After several weeks

of reported attempts, Orta apparently got cold feet and asled out

of the assignment. He suggested another candidate who made

several attempts without success.

12. Joe then indicated that Dr. Antony Verona, one si the

principal officers in toe Cuban Exila Junta, 3al become lis-

affected with the apparent ineffectual progress of the juata and

was willing to handle the mission through his own esources.

13. DI. Verona was approached and jumped it the oppos-

tunity of getting lavolved in an independent operalich. He was

told that the private interests backing the project did not wast

the U. S. Government and, particularly the CIA, to loon si thei

involvement. (So laf as this Office knows, he has never divulged

his participation in the project to the Agency.)

11. He aaked, as a prorequisito to the deal, thai be be given

$10, 000 or organizational expenses and requested 31, 500 vorts

of communications equipment.

15. Dr. Verona's potential was never juily espioited, is

the project was canceled shortly after the Bay si Pigs episode.

Verona s7a3 advised that the offer was withdrion, und the sills
