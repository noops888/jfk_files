- ADMINISTRATIVE -

Subject in interview denied being or having been

Dominican intelligence agent or receiving money from

Dominican

Republic (DR). Investigation reflects subject

was the police official contacted by DR Consulate, Miami,

for liaison purposes and once accepted invitation

of Dominican

government to visit DR. It is further noted that MM 768-C

on October 26, 1961, advised that ROBERT EMMETT JOHNSON, self-

described foreign affairs analyst for former Dominican leader

RAFAEL L. TRUJILLO MOLINA, 1956-60, claimed to MM 768-C that

SAPP for years had sold information to the Dominican government

and that the files in the DR should show this; however, it is

noted that JOHNSON was interviewed on two separate occasions

by the Miami Office as a result of his claims to knowledge of

Dominican intelligence operations. When specifically questioned

for positive information, he claimed to have no specific

knowledge.

It is further reflected in Miami files that on

October 12, 1958, EDUARDO HERNANDEZ, then serving as Cuban

Consul in Miami (identity should be

protected), advised SA

ROBERT JAMES DWYER that Detective CHARLES SAPP of the Miami

Police Department had informed HERNANDEZ of the arrest of

HUGO GONZALEZ LAJONCHERE and furnished HERNANDEZ with a police

report on the matter. HERNANDEZ had been contacted in connec-

tion with invéstigation of the case entitled "SERGIO SANJENIS

CABARROCAS, aka; ET AL," Bufile 2-1505.

This case dealt with

the investigation of the possible formation of a demolition

team to operate against the then Cuban government which

HERNANDEZ then represented in Miami.

Miami files reflect that SAPP has in the past

furnished information in connection with criminal intelligence

matters to the Miami Office and continues to do so at the

present time in connection with the hoodlum program.

In view of the above, it is not felt that

investigative effort is warranted in connection with thither

matter and it is closed.

ORTIZ,

that he did not know the full name of anyone named Sargento

Chars H. but that a few years ago, while visiting the captain

of the yacht which belonged to the then Dominican leader

RAFAEL L. TRUJILLO MOLINA, ORTIZ. heard from the crew that

TRUJILLO had a close friend in Miami who was a Sergeant in

the Miami Police Department. When the yacht visited Miami,

a Sergeant CHARLES would meet the yacht, board it, and state

he did not know this individual personally and could furnish

that on one occasion some time ago, exact date not recalled,

the DR were probably paid for by the Dominican government

but the informant had no specific proof of this.
