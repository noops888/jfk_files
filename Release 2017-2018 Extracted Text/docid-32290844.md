mclares

Re Dallas teletype, 3/22/62.

On 3/22/62, DL 149_C advised that he had been

in

conversation with J.

B. KING, R., sIt. Worth gambler, on that

date.

J. B. KING's reliability is unknown both to the informant

and this office.

KING told informant that rumors prevalent

around Ft. Worth were to the effect that Federal authorities were

"putting so much heat on the Police Department and causing a lot

of trouble.""

SA JOSEPH M. MYERS was mentioned by KING to the

informant as being one of the federal Agents who was investigating

Federal crimes in the Ft. Worth area. KING also mentioned to

informant that several "higher ups" in the Ft. Worth Police Dept.

had been stating that they were going to see SA MYERS' boss in

(Dallas to get him to "keep his nose out of

their business."

The foregoing is for the Bureau's information in view of

scandal developing in the Et. Worth Police Department

which has been previously brought to the Bureau's attention..

view of the potentially explosive situation in the Ft. Worth PD,

it is not believed desirable for the SAC to pursue this-matter;

however, it is being closely followed and the Bureau will be advised

of any further developments.
