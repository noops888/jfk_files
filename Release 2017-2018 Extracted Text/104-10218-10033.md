here, particularly among the foreign service personnel (maids,

french embassy the general feeling is that ose should stay away

from the place, 'since no diplomats of status go there, except:

on rare occasions (an especially good film). The enlisted

Averican military personnel are known to use the facilitles of

the club to shack up with foreigners.

he married to Soviet national who might not be able to leave with
