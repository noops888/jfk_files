LA COSA NOSTRA

AR - CONSPIRACY

Re Chicago airtel to Bureau, 10/5/67, regarding a

proposed meeting of Chicago Division Agents with

Milwaukee

informant MI 623-C-TE.

On 10/17/67, SAS CARLYLE N. REED and DANIEL E. BRANDT

of the Milwaukee Division were in contact with MI 623-C-TE at

Milwaukee.

Informant stated he could make himself available for

a meeting with Chicago Agents. He is unavailable on Fridays,

and the most convenient day of the week would be a Monday.

would be available on 10/30/67, if that date does not conflict

with the schedule of the Chicago Agents who desire to interview

this informant.

Chicago should advise as to whether or not 10/30/67

is a satisfactory date.

Thereafter, Milwaukee will notify

Chicago as to an exact

time and place after recontact with the

informant. Time and place will be in keeping with security

precautions necessary to avoid compromising MI 623-C-TE.

The foregoing is, of course, on a UACB basis.
