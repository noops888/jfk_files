Title: JFK RECORDS COLLECTION ACT OF 1992 (The Act)

Synopsis: Cleveland is requested to conduct necessary research

pursuant to the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) letter

requiring the FBI's response by 10/21/96.

requested to send pertinent files to Headquarters/JFK Task Force as

soon as possible.

Details:

The ARRB by letter dated 9/10/96 (copy available upon

request) has requested that the FBI identify all information in FBI

assassination records that the FBI believes is under court seal.

The ARRB's interest in this matter, is to have the Department of

Justice assist in petitioning the courts to unseal the records so

the documents may be opened to the public as established by the JFK

Assassination Records Collection Act (JFKARCA) .

In accordance with the ARRB letter, the FBI must identify

which jurisdictions/judges placed these records under court seal.

In the case of electronic surveillance, the ARRB also seeks the

location

and

the duration of

the surveillance.

Because the

backaround information concernina these electronic surveillances

are

maintained

in the Field Office,

we are requesting that the

field do the research necessary to respond to the ARRB's request.

The ARRB seeks the following information:

1) the name and jurisdiction of the judge approving the

electronic surveillance.
