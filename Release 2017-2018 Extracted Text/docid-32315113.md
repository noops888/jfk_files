he was dealing with would be notified by Federal officers

before they

"eome in."

SAMMY pointed out to LA DUCA

that there were no dice games operating, only card

games.

With regard to the above, it is pointed out

there has

been much apprehension among the gamblers in

Niagara Falls concerning some of the wagering stamp

raids which Internal Revenue officers occasionally

stage.

This may be the Federal officers to whom SAMMY

refers.

In

adaition, SAMMY may be saLvaTore saMUel

QUARCINI who

is a symbol informant of this office,

and this may be an attempt to let his associates

think he (QUARCINI) has some "in" with Federal officials

since he is an informant.

Further inquiry is' being made

to determine whether or not SAMMY is SAMUEL QUARCINI and,

If so, whether he has divulged his confidential relationship

with the Bureau.

If that is true, a recommendation

will be made as to his continuance.

He has furnished

much valuable information, contacts with him have been

most circumspect, and no information has been furnished

him by
