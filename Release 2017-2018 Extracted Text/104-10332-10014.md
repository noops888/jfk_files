Here it is... with Jeremy's improvements. Please read it carefully as I had to rush through this. Some of Jeremy's comments were slight

wording changes so as not to offend "the Board" so you may not notice much change. The biggest substantive change was on my FOIA

section (I have skillfully crafted this section to avoid the use of that four letter word!). Please note there is one more paragraph now

because I did add a bit about Scelso being an "official". And don't forget to attach to Stokes-DCI letter which I will fax back to you.

Have fun - and let me know if you need help.

'Mr. Scelso. It would have been in the case of dissimina-

tion of information about him, but I do not think that any

operational action would have been taken to apprehend him or

to contact him or to try to force him back to the United

States.

Mr. Goldsmith. What about in terms of -- how would the

dissemination have been treated differently?

Mr. Scelso.

Well, it simply means that we would have

disseminated any additional information that we got.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did Headquarters ever criticize the

Mexico City station for failure to send this information?

Mr. Scelso. No. That was not because we were trying to:

go easy on them, it is simply because it is in the nature of

the business.

What you are trying to do is engage, as I used

to say, in important illegal manipulations of society,

secretly.

Mr. Scelo.

Yes.

Now, why did they not report everything they found out?

MI. Goldsmith. Answer your own question.

American

Mr. Scelo. The telephone center envoy was manned by

Jan American, or Mexicant o

These people were just inundated with information

and apparently did not extract this and transmit it back to

Washington.

The later contacts with the Cuban Embassy, and so on,

which only were divulged after the assassination. It is an

enormous problem.

Mexico had one of the biggest and most/

active telephone intercept operations in the whole world

and the job of processing this material is just impossible.

Mr. Goldsmith. Let's go through this step by step,

although I was not going to do this at this time. I am going

to modify the line of inquiry somewhat.

Do you know how many telephone intercepts there were

in the Mexico City station?

MI. Scelo. How many lines were being tapped?

MI. Goldsmith. Yes, at the Cuban and then at the soviet.

Mr. Scelo. I think there are about 30 lines being tapped

altogether. That is just the number that sticks in my mina.

Mr. Goldsmith. Thirty meaning a total of thirty from ou

both the Soviet and the Cuban?

MI. Scelo. And various security suspects.

MI. Goldsmith. Would the security suspects

to the Soviet or Cuban?

Mr. Scelo. Some of them were American Communists

living there whom we tapped at the specific request of j.

Edgar Hoover.

Mt. Goldsmith. Of those thirty lines now many, at your sle

best estimate, would have been for the Soviet and Cubans?

Mx. Scelo. However many outside telephone lines they

had.

Mr. Goldsmith. You think just about every outside

phone?

Mr. Scelo. I think they tapped all the outside lines.

Mr. Goldsmith. How certain of that are you?

Mr. Scelo. Well, this is just based on my recollection,

going back 15 years.

Mr. Goldsmith. In any event, your earlier comment was

that the telephone surveillance operation in Mexico City

was one of the most extensive in the world?

Mr. Scelo. Yes. And of course, they taped a great

deal which they could not exploit. They could not later

listen to it; they did not have time. They used to listen

to it sort of spottily, you see, and attempt then to exploit

what was the most important.

MI. Goldsmith. Is the Mexico City's station's operations

one of the most sensitive of all of the stations at the

Agency?

Mr. Scelso.'

It was then. That is; the variety and

number of telephone taps, surveillance teams, photo operations

and other technical operations

That exceeds anyplace else that we had in the world

by a lot. There is no other station in the world that has

that good operations.

Then came

That got to be real good. Nothing

like it in Europe.

Mr. Goldsmith. I would like to draw your attention to

a

cable which, unfortunately, I do not have with me.

The cable

is referred to in Book 5 of the Senate report, written by

Thomas Karamessinas to the Mexico City station in which he

indicate and said the arrest of Sylvia Deran would jeepordize

U.S. freedom of action.

Do you remember that cable?

MT. Scelso. Yes. •

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know why it was sent?

MI. Scelso. At that time, we were not sure that Oswald

migit not have been a Cuban agent, and the arrest of a

foreign consular person was quite a serious matter under

international law.

Although Sylvia Duran was a Mexican citizen, I believe,

nevertheless, I did not think -- Karamessinas may not have.

stage.

Another important operation directed against the Cubans t

sophisticated provocation that won the CIA Intelligence Mel

for Stan Archenhold, f the case officer who conceived it f

operation consisted of a series of letters sent to the Cuban intens

gence service in their Mexico City Embassy from a person ex

purported to be a ciA officer trying to help them. The letter

purport to implicate Joaquin Ordoqui, a respected, old-guard

leader of the Cuban Communist Party and a high-ranking him

tary leader, as a CIA agent. The letters are based on informatio

trom Carlos Manuel Pellocer, the Guatemalan exile and penetr

tion agent, who was closely associated with Ordoqui and Mares

Rodriguez when all three lived in Mexico City during the late

1950s. The letters continue to be sent to Cuban intelligenoe al

though Ordoqui was arrested in 1964, and the desired contro

versy and dissension in the Cuban revolutionary leadership

followed.

As the cover of Sherry, the chief of the Cuban operations ser

tion, is in the Embassy consular section, he has been able to meet

several of the Cuban consular officers directly. However, his main

agent for direct assessment of the Cubans is Leander Vourvoulias,

Consul of Greece and President of the Consular Corps.

Support Operations

The support operations must also be detailed. (The joint opert

tion for telephone tapping, LIENVOY, is effected in cooperatios

With the Mexican authorttes and has a capacity for about forty

lines. The station provides the equipment, the technical assistance,

couriers and transcribers, while the Mexicans make the conne

tions in the exchanges and maintain the listening posts. In add

tion to monitoring the lines of the communist diplomatic missions

and those of Mexican revolutionary groups, LIEN VOY also coves

special cases. For years the telephones of ex-President Cárdenas

and his daughter have been tapped, and recently tapping ha

started on that of Luis Quintanilla, a Mexican intellectual who i

planning a trip to Hanoi with the publisher of the Miami Ne

and with a fellow of the Center for the Study of Democrati

532

institutions in Santa Barbara. Reports on plans for this trip are

ent immediately to the White House.

,. The station also has its own unilateral telephone-tapping

operation which is limited to special cases where the involvement

of the Mexicans is thought to be undesirable. Connections for this

operation are made outside the exchanges by telephone company

engineers who work as station agents, as in the case of the bugging

of the Cuban Embassy (LISAMPAN). However this is restricted as

far as possible in order to avoid damaging relations with the

Mexicans in the event of discovery.

Travel control, general investigations and oocasional surveil

lance are the duties of a six-man team called LIPIRE. They obtain

light-travel lists from the airport, which are passed daily to the

station and take photographs of passengers to and from com-

munist countries and of their passports as they pass through

immigration.

Another eight-man surveillance team, known as L'EMBRACE,

has vehicles (including a Volkswagen photo-van) and radio-

communications equipment and is mainly concerned with Soviet/

satellite and Cuban targets. It is administered by Jim Anderson, $

who also controls another eight-man team (LIRICE), similarly

equipped, which deals with the Mexican revolutionaries and other

miscellaneous targets.

Postal interception is mainly directed towards the mail from

communist countries, but can occasionally be used to get corres-

pondence from selected Mexican addresses.

As in every station, a variety of agents assists in support tasks

which they perform in the course of their ordinary jobs. For

prooessing the immigration papers for station non-official cover

personnel, for example, Judd Austin, I one of the US lawyers in

Goodrich, Dalton, Little and Riquelme (the principal law firm

serving American subsidiaries) is used. The Executive Vice

President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico

City, Al Wichtrich, I channels political information to the station

that he picks up in his normal work with American and Mexican

businessmen. For technical support the station has an officer of

ISD under Embassy cover with a workshop and qualification:

in audio, flaps and seals, and photography.

that they were engaged in political activities. The Chinese bad t

fact, been using the NCNA ofice for propaganda and support

pro-Chinese revolutionary organizations in Mexico and Centr

America.

Central American Exiles

Mexico has traditionally been a haven for political exiles from

Central American countries including communists and other

extreme leftists. Several Central American parties, including the

Guatemalans, maintain liaison sections in Mexico City in order

to keep lines open to the Soviets, Cubans and others. They

operate semi-clandestinely for the most part in order to avoid

repression from the Mexican government.

Washington DC

20 December 1966

Because of the strategic importance of Mexico to the US, its size

and proximity, and the abundance of enemy activities, the

Mexico City station is the largest in the hemisphere. Altogether

the station has some fifteen operations officers under State

Department cover in the Embassy political section, plus about

twelve more officers under assorted non-official covers outside the

: Embassy. In addition, a sizeable support staff of communications

officers, technical services, intelligence assistants, records clerks

and secretaries bring the overall station personnel total to around

fifty.

Liaison Operations

Dominating the station operational programme is the LITEMPO$

project which is administered by Winston Scott, # the Chief of

Station in Mexico City since 1956, with the assistance of Annie

Goodpasture, I a case officer who has also been at the station for

some years. This project embraces a complicated series of opera-

tional support programmes to the various Mexican civilian

security forces for the purpose of intelligence exchange, joint

524

operations and constant upgrading of Mexican internal intelli-

fence collection and public security functions.

At the top of the LITEMPO operation is the Mexican President,

Gustavo Diaz Ordaz, + who has worked extremely closely with the

station since he became Minister of Government in the previous

administration of Adolfo Lopez Mateost (1958-64). Scott had

also developed a very close working relationship with Lopez

Mateos, and, since Diaz Ordaz became President two years ago,

Soott has been working closely with the current Minister of

Government, Luis Echeverria. Thus the LITEMPO project

focuses at the top on the President and the current Minister of

Government who will be the second consecutive choice of PRI

kaders to pass from internal security to the presidency.

Scott's chummy relationship with Diaz Ordaz none the less has

its problems. In 1964 Fulton Freeman went to Mexico City as

Ambassador to crown a Foreign Service career that had started

in the same Embassy in the 1930s. He is expected to retire after

the 1968 Olympic Games. At the time of his assignment to Mexico

City Freeman's expectations of meaningful diplomatic relations

with Diaz Ordaz collided with the President's preference for deal-

ing with Scott, and Freeman was relegated to protocol contacts

with the President while his diplomatic talents focused on the

Foreign Minister. The problem of who would deal with the Presi-

dent was confused somewhat by the Ambassador's insistence, not

long after arrival on a detailed briefing about the station opera-

tional programme, which Scott refused. Eventually both Scott

and the Ambassador visited the White House, where President

Johnson settled matters according to the wishes of the Agency

and of his friend Diaz Ordaz. Scott continued, of course, to work

with the President and the Ambassador never got the full briefing

he had demanded. Since then the relations between Scott and the

Ambassador have warmed, but the Ambassador forbids any

station operations directed against the Mexican Foreign Ministry.

While Scott frequently meets the President and the Minister of

Government, two non-official cover case officers handle the day-

lo day contact with the chiefs of the security services subordinate

to Echeverria. One of these officers is a former FBI agent who

worked in the legal attache's office in the Mexico City Embassy

- the legal attaché is usually the FBi office in an American

embassy. The pal officer had left the rai to come with the statlo

but pains have been taken to conceal his cIA employment t

order to avoid the bad blood that would result from the cix

"stealing' of an FBI officer. The two non-official cover officers ar

the equivalent of an AID Public Safety mission but in Mexico thi

. function is performed secretly by the station in deference to Mexf

can nationalist sensitivities - as is the case in Argentina. Through

the LITEMPO project we are currently providing advice and equip.

ment for a new secret communications network to function be

tween Diaz Ordaz's office and principal cities in the rest of the

country. Other joint operations with the Mexican security ser

vices include travel control, telephone tapping and repressive

action.

The station also prepares a daily intelligence summary for Diaz

Ordaz with a section on activities of Mexican revolutionary orga-

nizations and communist diplomatic missions and a section on

international developments based on information from head-

quarters. Other reports, often relating to a single subject, are

passed to Diaz Ordaz, Echeverria and top security officials. These

reports, like the daily round-up, include information from station

unilateral penetration agents with due camouflaging to protect the

identity of the sources. The station is much better than are the

Mexican services, and is thus of great assistance to the authoritie

in planning for raids, arrests and other repressive action.

Liaison between Scott and the Mexican military intelligence

services consists mainly of exchange of information, in order to

keep a foot in the door for future eventualities. The US military

attachés, moreover, are in constant contact with their Mexica

military intelligence counterparts and their reports are reoeived

regularly by the station.

Stan Watson, i the Mexico City Deputy Chief of Station, has

been meeting with a South Korean CIA officer who was recently

sent under diplomatic cover to monitor North Korean soundings

for establishment of missions in Mexico and Central America

Communist Party Operations

The station cp section consists of two case officers, Wade

Thomast and Ben Ramirez,$ both under Embassy cover, plus

526

* two case officers outside the station under non-official cover: Bob

Driscoll, i a retired operations officer now working under con-

¿tract, and Julian Zambianco who was transferred from Guayaquil

1o Mexico City about a year ago. These officers are in charge of

agent and technical penetrations against the revolutionary organi-

rations of importance. The quality of this intelligence is high,

although not as high as it was before 1963. In late 1962 Carlos

Manuel Pellecer, the station's most important communist party

penetration-agent, broke openly with communism by publishing

a book. He was a leader of the Guatemalan Communist Party

(PoT) and had been Minister of Labor in the Arbenz government

during the 1950s. However, after the Agency-sponsored over-

throw of the Arbenz government Pellecer made his way to Mexico

City where for years he was the station's best source (cryptonym

LINLUCK) on all the revolutionary organizations in Mexico, not

just the Guatemalan exiles. His book, of course, was financed by

the station and distributed by the Agency all over Latin America.

Pellecer is still being used by the Mexico City station as a propa-

ganda agent, as with other former penetration agents who form-

ally break with communism without revealing their years of work

as spies - Eudocio Ravines,f the well-known Peruvian defector

from communism is a parallel case. Another book by Pellecer,

also financed by the station, has just appeared. This book is a

continuation of cIA exploitation of the Marcos Rodriguez and

Joaquin Ordoqui cases in Cuba, and is aimed at denigration of the

Cuban revolution.

The station also collects information about communists from

the US living in Mexico. Many of them arrived during the Mc-

Carthy period and some have subsequently become Mexican

citizens. Information about them is mainly of interest to the FBl,

which calls them the American Communist Group in Mexico

City (ACGMC). Information collected about them includes that

obtained through the LIENVOY telephone-tapping operation des-

cribed below.

The station also receives copies of reports from FBI penetration

operations against Mexican revolutionary organizations. Mexico

is the only country in Latin America, except Puerto Rico, where

the FBi continued operations against the local left when the CIA

100k over in 1947. The FBI intelligence is of high quality.

Soviel/Satellite Operations

The largest section in the station is that covering Soviet/satellins

operations. It has four case officers, three intelligence assistan.

and a secretary, all under Embassy cover, and four case officer

under non-official cover. It is headed by Paul Dillont and u

other official cover case officers are Donald Vogel, # Cynthi

Hausman and Robert Steele. # A number of sensitive operation;

sure underway.

The station has two observation posts in front of the Soviet

Embassy, which cover the entrances, plus a third observation post

in the back of the Embassy to provide coverage of the gardens

The LICALLA observation post in the back is the closest of five

houses bordering the Embassy property - all five are owned by

the station. Several years ago films were made of Soviets con-

versing in the garden, but attempts by Russian lip-readers to dis-

cover their conversations were unsuccessful. From one of the

front op's, radio contact is maintained with the LIEMBRACE

surveillance team for signalling when a particular Soviet surveil

lance target leaves the Embassy, his route and other data. Photos

are regularly taken from all the op's of Soviets and their families

and all visitors to the Embassy. When visitors use vehicles, photo-

graphs are taken of their licence plates for tracing. Occasionally

the LICALLA OP is used for electronic monitoring, since it is

close to the Embassy, but so far attempts to pick up radiations

from Soviet cryptographic equipment have been unsucoess-

ful.

In addition to the LIEMBRACE surveillance team, several other

support operations include coverage of the Soviets. Through the

DENVOY operation, Soviet telephones are constantly monitored,

and through the LIFIRe travel-control operation photographs of

travel documents are obtained along with data on arrivals and

departures. Monitoring of Mexican diplomatic communications

reveals requests for Mexican visas by Soviet officials, including

the diplomatic couriers. In addition, NsA is also monitoring

several communications systems involving "burst' transmissions

from the ussr to as yet unidentified agents believed to be in

Mexico - possibly Soviet intelligence officers assigned abroad as

"illegals', with false identity and non-official cover.

528

The station runs between fifteen and twenty access agents

rainst the Soviets with varying degrees of effectiveness and

riability. Several of these agents are suspected of having been

cruited by the Soviets for use as double agents against the

ation. Two of the most important of the current access-agents

dare Katherine Manjarrez, I Secretary of the Foreign Press Associa-

ton, and her husband - both of whom are targeted against the

Soviet press attache and the Tass correspondent. Others are

WCOWL-If and LIOVAL-1.$

LicowL-1 is the owner of a tiny grocery store situated in front

of the Soviet Embassy where the Soviets buy odds and ends in-

duding their soft drinks - TsD is studying ways of bugging a

wooden solt-drink case or the bottles themselves. More import-

ant, LICOWL-I is involved at the moment in an operation against

the Embassy zavhoz (administrative officer), who spends consider-

able time chatting with the agent. Because Silnikov, the zavhor,

has been on the prowl for a lover - or so he said to LICOWL-1 -

the station decided to recruit a young Mexican girl as bait: An

appropriate girl was obtained through BESABER, I an agent who

is normally targeted against Polish intelligence officers and who

runs a ceramics business specializing in souvenirs. By loitering at

LICOWL-l's store the girl attracted Silnikov's attention, and a

hot necking session in a back room at the store led to several

serious afternoon sessions at the girl's apartment nearby -

obtained especially for this operation. Silnikov's virility is as-

tonishing both the girl and the station, which is recording and

photographing the sessions without the knowledge of the girl.

Although promiscuity among Soviets is not abnormal, relation-

ships with local girls are forbidden. Eventually it will be decided

whether to try blackmail against Silnikov or to provoke disrup-

tion by sending tapes and photos to the Embassy if the blackmail

is refused.

LIOVAL-1$ is not as interesting a case but is more important.

The agent is an American who teaches English in Mexico City

and is an ardent fisherman. Through fishing he became acquain-

Red with Pavel Yatskov, the Soviet Consul and a known senior

KG officcI - possibly the Mexico City rezident (KG B chief). Yats-

kov and the agent spend one or two week-ends per month off in

the mountains fishing and have developed a very close friendship.

529

## Page 25

13-00000

When Yatskov is transferred back to Moscow - he has ar

been in Mexico for some years - we shall decide whether to tryto

defect him through LIOVAL-1. Recently Peter Derabin, $ 16)

well-known KGB defector from the 1950s who is now a US citizer

and full-time CIA employee, went to Mexico City to study th

voluminous reports on Yatskov written by LIOVAL-1. He cor

cluded that there is a strong possibility that LIOVAL-1 has been

recruited by Yatskov and is reporting on Paul Dillon, the statlon

officer in charge of this case. Nevertheless, the operation con

tinues while the counter-intelligence aspects are studied further

The station double-agent cases against the Soviets, LICOZY-1,%

LIcozy-31 and LICOZY-S,$ are all being wound up for lack,

of productivity or problems of control. One of these agents

LICOZY-3, is an American living in Philadelphia who was rei

cruited by the Soviets while a student in Mexico, but who reported

the recruitment and worked for the Mexico City station. He

worked for the FBI after returning to the US - the Soviet case

officer was a UN official at one time - but recently Soviet interest

in him has fallen off and the FBI turned the case back over to the

Agency for termination.

Against the Czechs and the Poles many of the same types of

operation are targeted. Acoess agents, observation posts, tele

phone tapping, surveillanoe and travel control are continuous

although with somewhat less intensity than against the Soviets.

In the Yugoslav Embassy the code clerk has been recruited by the

CIA as has one of the Embassy's secretaries.

Until the New China News Agency (NCNA) office was closed

last month by the Mexican government, the Soviet/satellite sec.

tion of the station was responsible for following the movements

of the Chinese communists. Telephone intercepts through

LIENVOY and oocasional surveillance by the LIRICE team were

directed against them, but the most important intelligence col.

lected against them was from the bugging of their offices. The

audio operation was supported by the Far East Division in head-

quarters, who sent an operations officer and transcribers to

Mexico City. Now that the NCNA offices are closed, the audio

equipment will be removed and the station will continue to

follow up the many leads coming from the bugging operation.

530

an Operations

She Cuban operations section consists of two case officers,

francis Sherry and Joe Piccolo, and a secretary under Embassy

over and one case officer under non-official cover. An observa-

gion post for photographic coverage and radio contact with the

LEMBRACE surveillance team is functioning, as well as LIENVOY

elephone monitoring and LifIre airport travel control. Through

to LIFIRE team the station obtains regular clandestine aocess

to the Prensa Latina pouch from Havana, and copies of corres-

pondence between P headquarters in Havana and its correspon

dents throughout the hemisphere are forwarded to the stations

concerned.

Through the LITEMPO liaison operation the Mexican immi-

gration service provides special coverage of all travellers to and

from Havana on the frequent Cubana flights. Each traveller is

photographed and his passport is stamped with arrival or depar-

fure cachets indicating Havana travel. The purpose is to frustrate

the Cuban practice of issuing visas on separate slips of paper in-

dead of in the passport so as to obscure travel. Prior to each

Cubana departure the station is notified of all passengers so that

name checks can be made. In the case of US citizens, the Mexican

service obliges by preventing departure when requested by the

station.

The most important current operation targeted against the

Cuban mission is an attempted audio penetration using the tele

phone system. Telephone company engineers working in the

LIDENY tapping operation will eventually install new wall-boxes

for the Embassy telephones in which sub-miniature transmitters

with switches will have been cast by ISD. At the moment,

however, the engineers are causing deliberate interference in

Embassy telephones by technical means in the exchange. Each

lime the Embassy calls the telephone company to complain of

interference on the lines, the engineers report back that every.

thing in the exchange is in order. Eventually, as the interference

continues, the engineers will check street connections and finally

arrive to check the instruments in the Embassy. They will find the

wall-boxes "defective" and will replace them with the bugged

boxes cast by ISD. Right now, however, this operation (crypto-

(g) Format of Transcripts

The format of the transcripts that Mr. Tarasoff

produced was much the same as those of the Spanish

language transcripts described above.294/ Mr.

Tarasoff's transcripts were from Russian into English. 295/

Many of Mr. Tarasoff's transcriptions bear the notation

"(previously transcribed)" after the meter

referring to the reel footage location of a

conversation.297/ Mr. Tarasoff indicated that this

notation meant that the conversation had already been

transcribed from a tap on another embassy phone:

"previously transcribed"

means, for instance,

I went to the embassy first and the embassy

number was 605055.

Now this number 501264

belonged to the

film's office.

So consequently

I SUFFERED A DISABLING STROKE IN

Subj: EX-CIA Agent Adds Fuel to Kennedy Assassination Fire

EX-CIA Agent Adds Fuel to Kennedy Assassination Fire

By Michael Dorman

(c) 1996, Newsday

The chief CIA investigator of President John F. Kennedy's assassination has

testified that another high ClA official - noted for seeking conspiracles -

disobeyed orders in repeatedly conferring with the Warren Commission shortly

after the murder. The witness also said a colleague once told him that the ClA

official, the late

James Angleton, "has ties to the Maria"

Almost 33 years after the assassination, the identity of the witness, who held

various top-secret CIA jobs, is considered so sensitive that federal authorities

insist on withholding his true name. He is known only by the alias "John

Scelso."

While Scelso testifled before the House Select Committee on Assassinations in

1978, his 192-page testimony was kept secret until now. It has just been sent to

the National Archives by the Assassination Records Review Board, a federal :

agency that screens assassination documents and makes public those that do not

endanger national security.

Sceiso's testimony, which criticized operations of the CIA, FBI, Secret Service

and other agencies, likely will renew debates, especially among conspiracy

theorists, on the assassination and how it was investigated.

When Kennedy was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1965, Scelso was chier of a CIA

branch

responsible for operations in Mexico and Central America. Richard Helms, the ClA

chier of clandestine services and later the agency's director, placed Scelso in

charge of the assassination investigation. Angleton, a counterintelligence

official with close ties to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, "immediately went

Into action to do all the Investigating," Scelso testified, criticizing the

move sharply.

"Helms called a meeting at which Angleton and a lot of others were present and

told everybody that I was in charge and that no one should have any

conversations with anyone about the Kennedy case without my being present -

which was violated from the word go by Angleton, who dealt with the FBI and

the Warren Commission and (Warren Commission member and former CIA Director

Allen) Dulles himself.... Angleton ignored Helms' orders. I tried to get Helms

to make him obey and Heims said, "You go tell him.'"

Angieton, who died in 1987, spent much of his career searching for conspiracies

- belleving that there was a Communist mole in the CIA - and was presumed by

other ClA officers to have tried to press a conspiracy theory on the warren

Commission. The commission found no evidence of a conspiracy. Angleton. was

fired

in 1975. Years later, a mole was found - Aldrich Ames - but he had entered the

CIA after Angleton's dismissal.

At one point in the 1978 House testimony, committee attorney Michael Goldsmith

asked, "Do you have any reason to belteve that Angleton might have had ties to

organized crime?"

"Yes," replied Scelso, who is now retired and lives abroad, government sources

sald. He said the Justice Department once asked the ClA to determine the true

names of people holding numbered bank accounts in Panama because the Marla was

hiding Las Vegas "skim" money there. "We were in an excellent position to do

this and told them so - whereupon Angleton vetoed it and said, 'That is the

bureau's (FBI's) business.' " Scelso said he discussed the situation with

another CiA officer. "And he smiled a foxy smile and said, "Well, that's

Angleton's excuse. The real reason is that Angleton himself has tles to the

Maria and he would not

want to doubie-cross them.'"

On another subject, Sceiso gave Kennedy conspiracy theorists a slight plece of

ammunition. A Soviet defector, Yuri Nosenko, was known to have told

investigators that Lee Harvey Oswald - Identified by the Warren Commission as

Kennedy's assassin - was not a Soviet agent. But Scelso said: "'! later heard

that Nosenko was discovered to have been dissembling, not being on the level.

That Information was imparted to me by ClA officers."

Based on the information ClA headquarters had on Oswald before the assassination

- chiefiy that he had been in the Marine Corps and defected to the Soviet Union,

then returned - Scelso said he saw no reason to pay him special heed. "Oswald

just seemed to me to be a small-potatoes defector," he said. But he conceded

that significant information about Oswald - known to CIA agents in Mexico City,

for example - had not reached headquarters before the assassination.

It dealt chiefly with Oswald's visits to the Soviet and Cuban embassies in

Mexico City and his attempts to obtain a Cuban visa two months before the

assassination. Scelso said the information falled to reach Washington because of

simple overwork and bureaucratic delays in the Mexico CIty office. He revealed

that all the outside telephone lines at the Soviet and Cuban embassies were

tapped by American agents and that calls Oswald made to them were recorded

After Oswald was arrested, Scelso revealed, agents compared audiotapes made

while he was in custody with the wiretaps and determined that he was the same

man who had visited the embassies.
