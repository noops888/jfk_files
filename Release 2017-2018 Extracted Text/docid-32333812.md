on the alert. Two apprentice fishermen, 15 or 16 years old,

had been accepted into the Cuban militia that day and a short

been issued their weapons.

The two boys were walking on

Calle 84 in a direction that carried them away from the beach.

As they approached the intersection of Calle 84 and Avenida 5

they observed the two members of Comandos I leave the wooded

area and challenged them.

The members of Comandos L withdrew

into the woods and the boys very excitedly commenced firing

their weapons into the air. This disturbance brought many

Cuban soldiers into the area and the four Cubans in the

Ramon Fonty Saumel has taken over the leadership of Comandos

directed at establishing a clandestine operation from within

Cuba. No action is planned until after the November,
