responsibilitles of inside Station control of the LINOTOR Project

to Marvin A. CABOT during a mesting held with the outside Staff

Agent for the LINDIOR Project, Seymour D. TRINICH, What follows

is the first in a series of Frogress Reports which it is hoped

will not only serve to keep Headquarters advised of just what

1s going on in the LIMOTOR Project but will also serve to apprise

Readquarters in greater detail of the performance of the LIMOTOR

Staff Agent on the outside under student cover.

During the

period under review TRINNICH's replacement, Natalie S. MICHNOFF

arrived to take over the outside responsibilities for LinstoR

In the future regular Progress Reports on LIMOTOR will be

subndtted on a quarterly basis.
