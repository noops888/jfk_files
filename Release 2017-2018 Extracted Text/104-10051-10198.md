G. E.

Gori, soviet consul in helsink, had asked him for Information

on Subject,

born'26 March 1926 in Ingermaniand.

• Subject entered Sweden in

1947,

and was the bearer of Svenskt främlingspass No. 7275/47.

According

to Golub,

Subject had disappeared from the Birgitta Hospital In Vadsteny

Sweden on 20 Mey 1959-

Vasa stated that Golub seemed to be "In a sweat" to get information on

Subject, but did not reveal his reason for wanting 1t. Vasa conjectured

that Subject may be elther suspected by the Sovlets of being "a NATO

dispatched spy," or

"a Soviet recrulted, apy who decided, to fire up the

business",

Vasa added that Subject might possibly be in the Soviet Union

now, and having

been appretended, the Soviets want to determine whether he

was sent by the West, or voluntarily returned to the Motherland.

Vasa expects no additional information on Subject from us, but It would be

Interesting to know whether Headquarters or Stockholm files contain any

Information

on subjeet.

Vasa stated that G. f. Golt 1& extremely Rotive in culthyating Fimieh

police officials at the upper levely, and regularly invites him, VAGus/,

Hainst, and Helsinki Folice Chief Karl Ertk Gabrielsson, separately,

to lunch.

Vasa claimed that Colub had lunch with some Finn "every dayll.
