The -Honorable John Glenn

Chairman

Committee on Governmental Affairs

Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Mr. Chairman:

I am writing to correct for the record two statements I

mage, when I testified betore the Committee, last Tuesday on

che Assassination Materials Disclosure Act.

I testified that there were 33pdocuments, amounting to

approximately 110 pages,

in the Oswald file that was

declassified and released to the public. A subsequent count

by my start revealed that the tile actually contains a cota

not chat to hit out

of 34 documents, amounting to 124 pages.

I gave the correct

numbers when I testified last Friday before the Subcommittee

on Legislation and National Security of the House Committee

on Government Operations.

In addition, I was asked'at your hearing by

Senator Cohen whether the State Department of the CIA had

had any contact with any Soviet officials concerning KGB or

GRU files relevant to the Kennedy assassination.

I

answered that there had been no contact between the CIA and

the Russian KGB on this matter, and I added that the State

Department might have requested those files, but I was not

certain.

At the time, I believed that that was an accurate

answer.

I have since discovered, however, that in January

1992

an Agency official did ask the new Russian internal

service (MBRF) for any information related to the Kennedy

assassination.

The Russians advised us, after reviewing

their file holdings on Oswald, that they had nothing that â€¢

would

add to our knowledge or to the 22 November 1991 ABC

television special on this issue, which they termed

"detailed and objective."

To avoid disrupting our continuing efforts to gain

access to the Russian files on Oswald, the fact that the

Agency has had direct contacts with the Russian service on

this topic must remain classified.

correcting the public record, I suggest the following

unclassified statement:

In response to a request from the US embassy in

Moscow, the Russians have reviewed their file

they had nothing that would add to our knowledge

or to the 22 November 1991 ABC television special

on this issue, which they termed "detailed and

I enjoyed the opportunity to testify before the

Committee, and I hope that these corrections prove helpful.
