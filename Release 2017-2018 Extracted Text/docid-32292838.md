On 7/21/61, SA JOHN R. BRETT was in the office of

USA EDWARD F. BOARDMAN in Tampa, Fla., reviewing FGJ records

in another matter. Mr. BOARDMAN had three visitors,

identified

as GENE MITCHELL, Dr.

(FNU) RULE, and a white female, "SCOTTY"

(LNU) .

All advised Mr. BOARDMAN that they were there in

the interests of good government ánd for the best interests

of the country and not for political reasons.

"SCOTTY!' (LNU)

related that in 1954 when WILLIAM C. CRAMER was running for

Congress, she was approached by one PAUL DE PETRIE, who told

her that

a friend of his, SANTO TRAFFICANTE, was at that time

in court on some matter and wanted CRAMER'S

help, and DE PETRIE

wanted to know if she could arrange a contact with CRAMER SO

that he might make a substantial contribution to CRAMER'S

campaign fund but with the understanding that there would bef

strings attached to the contribution.

"SCOTTY" contacted GENE MITCHELL, who was then

campaign manager for CRAMER, and MITCHELL told her that he

did not want any part of the deal.

MITCHELL then took up the story, stating that as

campaign manager he received so many calls that he did not

make a record of all of them and did not take action on all

he would be willing to furnish the information he has

concerning CRAMER although he qualified this by stating that

two-thirds of his information was strictly hearsay.

Mr. BOARDMAN advised all three of his visitors that

he was not interested in political activities in any way, that

he was bound by the Hatch Act and was not going to take part

in any political activities.

Mr. BOARDMAN instructed his

visitors to submit any complaint or information they might

have to him in writing and he would then consider whatever

action he might be able to take after receipt of their complaint.

He pointed out that he normally did not do any investigation

in his'office, only prosecution, but stated he could request

investigation, and if a criminal action was brought to his

attention, he could do that.

he stated, however, he would

not take any further action on their information until he had

received something in writing from them,

and he declined to

listen to any further information they might furnish in the

matter.

Information from the records of the Central Bank

of Tampa, Tampa, Florida,

was

made available on 7/25/61, by

V. GENERAL ACTIVITIES, TAMPA, FLORIDA

Continued spot checks of the subject's residence,

2505 Bristol, Tampa, as well as spot checks of Columbia

Restaurant and the residences of subject's mother and brothers,

Tampa, have failed to disclose subject's presence in Tampa.

On August 9, 1961, JAMES COSTA LONGO and FRANK

TRAFFICANTE, brother of the subject, were observed at the

columbia Restaurant, Tampa.

They were accompanied

by a third

person believed to be the subject. Positive identification

was not possible, however,

as

this group proceeded to the back

Ioom of, the Columbia Restaurant.

The newspaper "Tampa Times", Tampa, Florida, reported

on August 9, 1961, that FRANK TRAFFICANTE was fined $15.00

in Tampa Traffic Court on charge of careless driving in

an

accident.

TP T-2 advised on August 8, 1961, that JAMES COSTA

LONGO and CASEY HERNANDEZ, part owner of the Columbia Restaurant,

have been spending a great deal of time at the office of Great

Southern Construction Company on East Hillsboro Avenue, Tampa. *-

The current Tampa City Directory lists CASIMERO HERNANDEZ as

president, Great Southern Construction Company.

T-2 was of the opinion that subject might well be

spending time at the same location since LONGO is often with

the subject when he is in town.

TP T-3 advised on July 25, 1961, that CESAR RODRIGUEZ

and GEORGE MICKEY GREEN, both of Tampa, were told to be

available about one o'clock, Saturday, July 15, 1961, on the

possibility they would have

a job to do.

T-3 advised he re-

ceived information that approximately: a year ago arman in

Havana, Cuba, had liquidated subject's assets there after

CASTRO came into power and was then supposed to return all of

the money received from this liquidation to the United States;

instead the man stayed in Cuba and did not send any of the

money to the subject. TRAFFICANTE and his group, according

to

T-3, have been trying ever since then to get the man out of

Cuba and were successful, probably Friday, July 14th.

T-3

advised he was not certain of this. T-3 related that he learned

that two of TRAFFICANTE's men were successful in getting this

from Cuba on a plane which brought him to Tampa, and after

his arrival he was given twenty-four hours to produce the

entire amount of money or else.

T-3 advised the "or else" was to be

and

were offered one thousand

work this man over if he did not come through.

T-3 advised this man apparently came through with the money as

were not called to work the man over.
