Terrorism by radical Cuban refugees has become a thorny

view of some authorities, i potential threit to the lives of

Ainerican leaders.

The terrorists goal is to wrest control of Cuba away from

its Communist dictator, Fidel Castro.

In pursuit of that goal, they have blazed a trail of violence

from Miami across the Caribbean Sea, not only to Cuba but

also to Mexico, Barbados, Jamaica and Panama-even across

the South Atlantic to Argentin:.

Now, as i new Administration prepares to take over in

Washington, it is feared that the Cuban terrorists will step up

their attacks in an effort to thwart any turn toward reconcili-

ation with Castro.

EXILES vs.

CASTRO—

A Relentless

Pursuit

On Jan. 1, 1959, Fidel Castro took power and

the first wave of refugees fled Cuba. A small

number of the 600,000 exiles who settled in the

U.S. have become extremists.

Highlights of events in those 18 years,

some

involving law-abiding exiles, others involving the

extremists.

1961: A 1,300-man Cuban Brigade, armed and

, trained by the U.S. in Florida, Guatemala and Nica-

ragua, landed at the Bay of Pigs on Cuba's south

shore. The invasion was a failure.

1962: Survivors of the Bay of Pigs were released

by Castro after payment of a 53-million-dollar ran-

som in drugs, food, medical equipment and other

supplies from

"private contributions." President

John F. Kennedy, in Miami, pledged to the Cuban

exiles that the Brigade flag would one day fly over a

liberated Cuba.

U.S. launched its secret "Operation Mongoose"-

a plan. to use Cuban exiles in paramilitary war

against Castro while U.S. maintained an economic

blockade to shake the island's economy. The attacks

generally failed.

1964: Cuban extremists in New York City fired a

mortar shell at United Nations as Cuba's Ché Gue-

vara addressed the General Assembly.

1967: Cuban exile specialists and U.S.-trained

Bolivian troops trapped and killed Guevara and

some of his Communist guerrillas in Bolivia.

1968-72: Cuban-exile extremists bombed ships

of nations considered to be friendly to Castro, ter-

rorized other exiles to keep them in line.

1972: Cuban exiles trained by Central Intelli-

gence Agency took part in Watergate break-in, later

testified that they thought it would help their anti-

Castro campaign.

1973: U.S. and Cuba signed agreement aimed at

controlling hijacking of aircraft and piracy of ships

1974-76: Cuban extremists exploded more than

100 bombs in Miami area in two-year period, hitting

offices of the FBI, a State attorney and the Miami

police department.

Exile terrorists attacked airline offices and consul-

ates of governments that have diplomatic relations

with Castro. Bombings took place in Jamaica, Mexi-

co, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Panama, other countries.

Fishing boats based. in Cuba and Soviet cargo

ships were

attacked by high-speed motor launches

_ manned by exile extremists.

Terror reached its peak with the bomb sabotage

of a Cuban airliner and the death of 73 passengers

and créw last October 6-near Barbados. Police

seized Cuban exiles in Caracas, Venezuela, on suspi-

cion of involvement in the sabotage. Castro can-

Who are these terrorists? What motivates them? How do

they operate? And why are U.S. officials so concerned about

what they may do in the future?

News & World Report staff dug deeply into the

records, interviewed Cuban refugees who share the hopes

enforcement officials who are trying to stem the violence.

BREEDING GROUND FOR TERRORISM

After Fidel Castro took over Cuba in 1959 and it became

apparent that he intended to establish a Communist state,

800,000 Cubans "voted with their feet" and Ned their

homeland. Some 600,000 of them settled in the United

States. They and their children now total 750,000. Most of

them live in the Miami area.

The majority of these immigrants are law abiding. But

Miami's "Little Havana" provides a culture in which the

virus of violence can grow.

explains one refugee leader, "the Cubans

keep their national identity, their heritage,

hatreds-and their hopes of going back to their homeland.

And they know they can't go back until Castro is gone. So

they dream of toppling Castro. What is clearly unrealistic in

other places in the United States seems very possible in the

atmosphere in Miami."

In the early 1960s, the overthrow of Castro seemed to the

Cubans in exile to be not only possible but almost inevitable.

It was U.S. policy to drive him from power. There was an

ittempt to invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs in 1961 with an

army of Cuban exiles recruited and trained in secret by the

CIA. The invaders were not given the air cover necessary for

i successful attack, and the operation was a disaster. Only

180 of about 1,300 invaders escaped death or capture. The

Cubans felt betrayed

Then came other American moves against Castro. There

was a secret "Operation Mongoose,

, which included efforts

to assassinate the Cuban leader. The United States backed an

economie blockade of Cuba in an attempt lo prevent Castro

from obtaining sorely needed supplies and equipment from

ibroad. Later, Cuban refugees were used to carry out secret

operations not only in the Caribbean but also in other parts

of Latin America-and even in Africa

To many Cuban refugees, attacking Castro and Commu-

nism became a way of life.

Since then, however, American policy has failed to match

in intensity the fierce anti-Castro passion of the more mili-

tunt refugees. In recent yeurs, prominent members of the

U.S. Senate have visited Cuba. In 1973, Cuba made an

agreement with the United States to curb the airplane

hijackers who had been using Cuba as asylum. There were

moves un both sides toward normalization of relations be.

tween Cuba and the U.S

As their hopes of American action against Castro ebbed,

some Cuban refugees turned to violence on their own. The.

box on this page gives the chronology of developments.

slogans and initials of yet another group. Among groups

named in testimony before the Senate

Internal Security

Subcommittee are: Accion Cubana, or Cuban Action; Alpha

66, a name adopted when victory in 1966 seemed possible;

FLNC, standing for Frente de Liberacion Nacional de Cuba,

which means Cuban National Liberation Front, and Pragma-

tistas, which means what it sounds like-pragmatists.

A group calling itself Zero issued a "death list" of people

marked for killing and, according to officials, several persons

on the list soon died violent deaths.

Dade County's antiterrorist head, Lieutenant Lyons, says

he has stopped trying to keep track of the groups and instead

concentrates on trying to solve the crimes that they are

suspected of having committed. Ile has no shortage of

business. Here is a sample of the violence attributed

terrorists in the last two years:

• Since February, 1975, there have been at least seven

assassination attempts directed against refugee leaders who

were viewed as opponents of the terrorists' tactics. Three

men were shot to death. One was killed by a bomb. Three

other attempted killings failed, but a prominent radio broad-

caster lost both legs below the knees when a bomb ripped his

• On Dec. 3-4, 1975, bombs blasted the Miami office of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation, a Social Security office, a

State unemployment office, two post offices, a bank, a State

attorney's office and the Miami police-department headquar-

ters. A man accused of those bombings, and also the bombing

of the Miami International Airport two months earlier, was

acquitted recently in a federal court. He is to be tried again

in a State court.

• A number of bombs have been exploded in New York.

One blew out the window of the Venezuelan consulate on

Fifth Avenue, across the street from St. Patrick's Cathedral.

• On Feb. 12, 1976, a Soviet freighter, the Dzhordano

Bruno, was sitting motionless 35 miles off Cuba's north coast

while its tanks were being cleaned. Suddenly a small boat

raced close to the freighter and raked it with heavy machine-

'gun fire. No one was injured.

• On April 6, 1976, two Cuban fishing boats were attacked

ind a fisher man was killed.

* On Sept. 21, 1976, in Washington, D.C., a bomb ex-

ploded in a car and killed Orlando Letelier, a former Chilean

Imbassador to the U.S. under the Marxist regime of the late

President Salvador Allende. Although the crime is officially

insolved, there have been persistent reports that the bomb

was planted by Cuban terrorists as a "favor" to the secret

olice of the present anti-Communist Government in Chile.

NEW TERRORIST STRATEGY

Leaders of the terrorist bands are hard to identify. But one

in has emerged as an apparent leader: Dr. Orlando Bosch,

pediatrician. He was caught firing a bazooka at a Polish

p in Miami harbor in 1968 and was sentenced to 10 years

Ir. Bosch was released on parole after four years, but he

ortedly returned to the movement. He is now under

to focus their efforts outside the U.S. To direct the activities,

a new group was formed with the initials CORU, which stand

for Coordinacion de Organizaciones Revolucionaires Unidas

in Spanish or Co-ordinating Committee of United Revolu-

tionary Organizations in English.

American law-enforcement officials say that members of

CORU have the backing of powerful forces, perhaps even

the governments themselves, in some countries of Latin

America. The terrorists are described as "at home" in Haiti,

the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua and Chile. They are well

armed for terroristic acts, as shown in the box on page 32.

Since the June meeting, a new wave of terrorism has swept

across the Caribbean and beyond. Bombs have damaged

Cuban airline facilities in Barbados, Jamaica and Panama.

Two Cuban officials were kidnaped in Argentina.

On July 23, three men who had flown from Miami carrying

three coffee cans filled with plastic explosive attempted to

kidnap Cuban Consul Daniel Ferrer Fernandez in Mérida,

Mexico. He escaped, but a Cuban fisheries expert was killed.

The most serious act of terrorism came on October 6,

when a Cubana Airlines DC-8 exploded in flight shortly after

taking off from Barbados. The plane fell into the sea, killing

73 persons including members of the Cuban national fencing

In messages to news media, both CORU and El Condor, a

group unheard of previously, claimed responsibility for the

crash of the plane.

Dr. Bosch, who has traveled freely on documents appar-

ently provided by officials of Governments friendly to the

anti-Castro movement, was picked up in Venezuela and on

November 2 was charged with homicide in connection with

the plane crash. Three other men are similarly charged.

The arrests of Dr. Bosch and his cohorts, instead of

reducing terrorist violence, may actually stimulate more

violence. El Condor, in a message to the United Press

International on November 19, said the four men held by the

Venezuelans are innocent und warned that, if they are

convicted, planes of the Venezuelan International Airways

will be attacked. On the same day, CORU sent a message

saying it would join with the Honduran Anti-Communist

Alliance in attacks on three airlines that plan excursion

Nights-to Havana.

Roberto Carballo, a militant leader. of veterans of the Bay

of Pigs invasion, denounced the threatened attacks. "It aids

Castro by making all Cuban exiles look like mad bombers,

Carballo said.

- CRACKDOWN BY LAW OFFICERS

Since last spring, there has been a sharp. reduction in

terroristic violence in the Miami area. That may be as much

due to a successful counterattack by law-enforcement agen-

cies as to the policy that was adopted by CORU last June.

includes representatives from Dade County and Miami po-

lice, the U:S. Customs Service and the U.S. Bureau of

Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Although the Federal Bu-

reau of Investigation is not formally a part of this task force,

its agents work closely with it.

With co-operation from Cuban refugees who are sick of

the terrorist violence, law officers have arrested a number of

suspects. Police also have learned enough about other sus-

pects so that their freedom to engage in new acts of violence

can be limited even though there is not enough evidence to

A federal grand jury is interrogating witnesses who might

have some knowledge of terror operations.

Efforts of law-enforcement officials to deal with the terror-

ist groups face formidable handicaps, however. The terrorists

seem to know

what police are doing. Lieutenant Lyons

relates that one suspect "identified one of my officers who

had never met him before, called him by name and told him

what section he worked in and what his duties were."

Terrorists are protected by a web of old loyalties. Most of

them worked at one time or another for the U.S. Govern-

ment. Many have had several roles: members. of the U.S.

Army, CIA operatives and FBI informants. One refugee

leader suggests that law enforcement officials have not found

the killers of Cubans "because they don't want to."

A further complication is the heavy infiltration of the

terrorist movement by members of Castro's intelligence

corps. They not only gather intelligence but sometimes act as

agents provocateurs, instigating terrorist acts designed to

discredit the refugees and influence American policy.

The Cuban Prime Minister has "surfaced" enough of such

agents to reveal their pattern of operation. Early this year,

for example, Manuel de Armas, a Cuban refugee who was

named in Senate committce testimony as having been in-

volved in terrorist activities in Miami, showed up in Havana

In an April 22 broadcast by Radio Havana, De Armas said

that he had supplied the explosives used in the killing of a

man named Rolando Masferrer and that a CIA agent had

provided him with the explosives.

In it speech on October 15, Castro boasted of a double

agent who Castro claimed had passed on coded instructions

from the CIA. Said Castro: "From the very moment when he

was recruited by the CIA and over, a period of 10 years, the

supposed agent has kept the Cuban Government fully in-

formed of all his contacts with [the CIA] and of the equip-

ment and instructions he has received."

Castro blained the CIA for the airliner bombing and other

acts of violence. "Who else but the CIA... can carry out

these acts?" Castro asked

Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has flatly denied U.S.

involvement in the airliner bombing. He said: "I can state

categorically that no official of the United States Govern-

ment, nobody paid by the American Government, nobody in

contact with the American Government has had anything to

do with this crash of the airliner. We consider actions like this

totally reprehensible."

The CIA declines to discuss Cuban refugee terrorism.

Officials of other Government agencies say they

seriously

donbt that the CIA, after all the criticism it has received for

some of its earlier activities, is still involved in operations

against the Castro regime. However, the agency is described

as providing very little help in combatting the terrorist

groups. "We have absolutely no contact with the CIA," says

Lieutenant Lyons. "I'd like to, but they don't talk to us." One

reason for that attitude may be that laws bar the CIA from

domestic law enforcement activities.

Other laws, or the lack of them, also complicate the fight

against the terrorists. U.S. agencies cannot become involved

in investigations of terrorism outside the United States unless

the crime involves violations of neutrality laws making it

to export arms without a license.

Although shocked by the October 6 airliner bombing, U.S

officials reluctantly decided there was no authorization for

the FBI to enter that case.

they can look forward to only limited success against the

terrorists. Any real solution to the problem must come fron

As officials size up the effects of the terrorist campaign:

The only tangible accomplishment has been to push Castro

into renouncing the antihijacking

RECORD

HOWARD S. LIEBENGOOD

SUBJECT: JUSTICE DEPARIMENT INFORMATION OF JANUARY 19, 1977

I called Larry Callahan at 2:00 p.m. to advise him that

the Commiteee desired to interview Mr. Gene A. Boren, of

the IRS, at the earliest available opportunity and requested

his advice and assistance to accomplish this. Callahan was

nervous about the Committee's eagerness to proceed in response

to the memorandum for fear that we would be interfering with

an on-going criminal investigation. He noted the FBI was looking

into this

and he would have to check with the Bureau to

ascertain the feasibility of proceeding unilaterally. I told

Callahan we did not want to interfere with a criminal investi-

gation and that I did not feel that our interview of the IRS

employee would fall into that category. Callahan referred to

a possible obstruction of justice

on the part of that employee

in that the information had been withheld for approximately

five years.

At 2:30 p.m. I received a telephone call from Paul Daly

urging Committee restraint in unilaterally investigating

subject matter. Daly noted the Bureau had just received this

information and was intending to interview the IRS employee.

and other individuals in question today or tomorrow. Daly

noted that he was disturbed that Callahan had brought the

memo to the Committee's attention so promptly, as the Bureau

had intended to brief the Committee at the conclusion of their

investigation. Daly seemed most concerned that the IRS delay

in bringing the matter to the Bureau's attention and assured

us that the Bureau was desirous of cooperating fully. He

noted the information had been furnished by Justice absent

a specific inquiry from the Committee and that we were being

unreasonable if we desired to pursue the matter further at

this time.

I asked Daly what information was available at the

Bureau on Brading and Hunt. He said there was a large quantity

of information available on both and that he felt he could pull

that material which related to the assassination quickly, but

would be reluctant to produce the information in its entirety.

I told him to ascertain this afternoon what information could

be produced immediately and he said that he would.

At 2:45 p.m. I talked again with Callahan who indicated

that Daly would be

calling. Callahan said he thought the

Bureau was

eager to redeem itself in this area and we should

give them that opportunity. I told Callahan that I was con-

cerned about the utilization of leaks, a position which Callahan

thinks is ridiculous. Callahan, however, did state that this

information was not as old as it looks at the Bureau, to-wit:

considerable time went by before Attorney General Levi could

address the issue of whether or not to entrust this matter to

the Bureau. Approximately one week ago, Justice went to Jim

Adams of the FBI with the request to look into the allegation

and was

surprised to find that Adams was already apprised of

the situation and investigating, i.e., general indexes.

Apparently, Adams had been in receipt of similar information

in recent days.

Yesterday, in response to the Attorney General's request

for information, Paul Daly hand carried to Callahan the Bureau's

response (which is dated January 14) and today Callahan hand

carried the package to us over Assistant Attorney General

Uhlmann;s signature. Callahan advised that Daly was upset that

the Committee had been so promptly advised for fear that we

would interupt the Bureau's inquiry. Callahan apologized for

the lack of responsiveness on the part of Justice and the Bureau

but things are in disarray with Levi about to depart. I assured

Callahan we did not desire to interfere in the investigation

but desired to be promptly informed of any developments and

that we would stay in touch with Paul Daly in that regard .

Callahan promised to expedite any Committee requests as

made.

Paul Daly called at 3:10 p.m. to advise that "the powers

that be" at the Bureau were upset with the possibility that the

Committee was considering going to Dallas and interfering with

the investigation. He specifically that the Director be given

an opportunity to talk with Inouye prior to any such action.

I told Daly that it was merely the Committee's desire to go

to Texas; I had heard no discussion of going regardless of

the Bureau's position. Daly promised to pull together without

the need for a written request, all available information on

Brading for Committee review this afternoon, if at all possible.

tapping charges, but there is also the

threat of more indictments

against

them by a federal grand jury that has

been sitting in Dallas for more than a

year. The Hunts claim their wiretap-

ping activities were aimed at uncov-

ering suspected embezzlements from

their father's food concern. In their

only statement on the matter, over a

year ago, they cited "extensive, unex-

plained losses" suffered by the com-

pany, "We only sought to protect our

father and his property, as any others

would have done,'

" they said.

But one of the wiretappers, Jon Jo-

seph Kelly, says that the tapping was

prompted by Bunker's and Herbert's

suspicions that someone was trying to

influence H. L. Hunt to leave the bulk

of his estate to the second Mrs. Hunt

and her children. Three of the wiretap

victims back up Kelly's version.

Just two weeks ago, in their syndi-

cated column, Jack Anderson and Les

Whitten aired a recurring Dallas ru-

mor that the grand jury is looking into

an alleged "$50,000 to $60,000 payoff"

from Bunker to the chairman of the

Senate Judiciary Committee, James O.

Eastland of Mississippi, in return for

Eastland's assistance in getting a pa-

role for the other wiretapper, Houston

private eye Patrick W. McCann III.

Eastland wrote a letter on McCann's

behalf, but Bunker has denied that

there was any payoff!

The Dallas grand jury, is said to be

mulling the Eastland connection, as

well as the circumstances surrounding

the three-year lapse between the wire-

tappers' arrest and the indictment of

Herbert and Bunker on Feb. 28, 1973. A

Hunt family lawyer told Dallas Morn-

ing News investigative reporter Earl

Golz that Bunker managed to strike a

bargain with the Justice Dept. in which

"there would be no prosecution of the

Hunts if they performed certain ac-

tions; they performed the actions, but

there was an indictment anyway."

The actions, reportedly made after

1972 meetings with former President

Richard M. Nixon and former Attorney

General Richard Kleindienst, included

Bunker's providing Justice with a list

of Al Fatah agents in the U.S. He had

secured the list privately because he

feared he was on the Al Fatah death

• list because of his Libyan holdings.

For the Hunts, the wiretapping epi-

sode has proved disastrous. Bunker and

Herbert could receive prison sentences.

And, more than anything else in the

family's history, it has torn the tightly

woven curtain of secrecy behind which

the family has lived and worked for

more than four decades.

PART TWO:

JIM BRADEN

One of

the most incredible bodies of recent information

concerning the alleged conspiracy to assassinate President

Kennedy is largely based on the investidative research

done by Peter loyes, a former CBS Producer and top inves-

tigative reporter.

Last year. Noyes published a book, Logacy of Doubt, which

summed up many of his findings, and which generally outlines

what Noyes believes was heavy Mafia involvement in the

assassination. The Noyes book is almost entirely factual

and

substantiated information such

as

police records provided by the FBI, the Los Angeles Police

Department, ¡the California Attorney General's Office, and

Texas police officials.

Though the Noves book (like most recent assassination books)

aId not sell well or receive much press attention, it has

been

regarded

as

a valuable

contribution by most of author

Noyes:

fellow Warren Commission critics..

It can definitely be said

that

almost all of Moyes' findings,

particularly with respect to his main character Jim Braden,

have been factually substantiated and are solidly established

by official police records.

Basically the Noyes book outlines the background of a

mysterious man who was picked

up by the police at the

of President Kennedy's assassination just minutes after the

thought he was behaving suspiciously. The man, who identified

nimself under the false name of Jim Braden, iwas released

shortly thercafter following brief questioning by the Dallas

Sheriff's Office.

Author Noyes uncovered the story of Jim Braden and his

true identity during five years of investigative

research.

And it is Jim Braden's true identity and his ironic misfortune

of being picked up

at the scene of the assassination

"looking suspicious" that the Warren Commission critics now

believe ranks with James McCord's mistake of leaving masking

tape on the doors during the Watergate break-in as the ultimate

fatal slip-ups in the two conspiracies.

Jim Bracion's Arrest On lovember 22

Deputy C.l. Lewis was one of the first Dallas police

officers on the scene. at the Texas School Book Depository

following the assassination..

Within just minutes after the deadly shots were fired,

Deputy Lewis.confronted a man across the street from the

Book Depository, a man whom Lewis thought was "acting.

suspiciously."

Deputy Levis

questioned the man for several minutes before

taking him to the Sheriff's office for further interrogation.

The man identified himself

as Jim Braden, and said that he

was. in the oil business in Beverly Hills, California. Deputy

Lewis became even more suspicious over the way. the man first

tried to identify himsolf. Instead of producing his driver's

licenso, the common means of identification, the man pulled

out a gasoline credit card instead.

The man who identified himself as Jim Braden strongly protested

when Deputy

Lewis told him

he would have to take him in

for further interrogation.

At the Sheriff's office, Jim Braden agreed to make a voluntary

statement. Braden, then

18, told the police that he was in

Dallas on oil business and

had been there for two days. Ho

said he was staying at the

Cabana Hotel, s short distance avay

from the scene of the assassination. Braden said he had been

walking down the street by the Texas Bool: Depository at the

time of the assassination and had been looking for a taxi cab.

Jim Braden

further

stated that he was confronted by Deputy

Lewis inside a building across

the street from the Depository

during an attempt to make a telephone call following the

shooting.

Braden was| shortly thereafter released by thc Dallas Sheriff's

office. Braden was not fingerprinted, nor was any check made

of possible criminal records relating

to him.

Two months later, in late January of 1964, Jim Braden was

interviewed by two FBI agents at his office in Beverly Hills.

The Marren Commission's investigation was thon in full sving

and witnessos to the assassination vere being questioned by

the FBI and other authorities. In his FBI interview, Braden

gave the same: account as he had given to the Dallas

police on

the day of the assassination. The FBI's official report on

Braden's interrogation further stated that,

"Braden has no

information concerning the assassination and both Lee Harvey

Oswald and Jack Ruby are unknown to him."

Jim Braden's°

True Identity Berses

In early 190P, Peter loves,

the investigative reporter

whose book covers much of

the information regarding Jim

Braden, began investigating the mysterious California

"oil man."

loves originally received a tip about Braden from a

former FBI agent who was then aiding District Attorncy

Jim Garrison's investigation of the Kennedy assassination.

The FBI man told Noyes of Braden's presence at the scene of

the assassination at the time of the shooting.

lloyes soon found that Jin Braden was no longer at cither

of the addresscs that he had given the Dallas police, and

had left no forwarding addresses.

Hoves then had the California Department of Motor Vehicles

run

a chock on the license number that Braden had given to

the Dallas police at the Sheriff's office following the

assassination. Motor Vehicles told Moyes that Braden's

license (H751755) had been

renewed by Braden in San Diego

county in lovember of 1966. Braden has also listed nou

business

and home addresses, which interestingly were over

a hundred miles apart.

The Department of lotor Vehicles' Iccords on Jim Braden

also showed that "Jim Braden" was not really his original

name. The license had actually been issued in the 1950's

to Buache lale Brading, which is Braden's true identity.

On September 10,

1963, just ten wecks before the assassination,

Eugenc

Hale Brading had notified the Department that he had

lcgally changed his name to Jin Braden, and he rcquested a

new license under that name. The license was granted.

Intrigued by the fact that Jim Braden vas really a false

identity assumed by Eugene Brading, investigator Noyes

contacted the Intolligence Division of the California

Attorney General's Office, and had a checl run on the.

mysterious Brading.

Hoves was told that Eugene Hale Brading "is a real bad guy.

He's got a long rap sheet and apparantly has Mafia connections.

Royes shortly thercafter obtained a copy of Eugene Brading's

(Jim

Braden's) police records.

HM 50955 DooId: 32123630

## Page 37

The Brading "rap sheet" contained an incredible 35

sopcrate entries covering virtually every phase of

crininal activity, including maid

fraud, emberzlement,

oneratina ai gambling house in Miami, car theft, shop

lifting, recciving stolen property,

and selling wartime

gas ration coupons on the black market.

most of these arrosts had been made under the name of

cugene Hale Brading, but the police dossier on him

also

showed a handful of

other aliases, including Marry lugene

Bradley, Gone Brady, James Lee Cole, James Bradley Lee,

and inevitably, Jim

Braden.

"Jin Braden" was the last entry shown on Brading's

records.

Incredibiv

investigator loyes found that due to the fact

that the Dallas policc had not fingerprinted Jim braden or

run a make on him, his truc identity of tugene Brading was

never discovered by the FBI or the Harren Commission at the

time of their invostigation of the assassination. The Warren

Commission had only routinely included Braden's

short state

ment about being in Dallas

on

"oil business" in

a police

exhibit of witnesses contained in Warren Commission Yearing's

Volume KIM.

Jim Braden and his story had been accepted at

in a number of schemes involving marriage to and embezzlement

(BRADING AND CLARK AND BAUMAI)

Brading and his friend Pereira later moved to Beverly Hills

in California. Shortly thereafter, Brading invitably came

under investigation by the Los Ingeles Police Department

Intelligence Division's Mafia specialists.

In particular, the LAPD interest in Brading was focused on

his close association in Bevorlv Hills with two oll specu

and Bauman were notorious Mafia

figures with long police

records.

As investigator Poter loves points out, the men listed

with Brading in the letter, represent a virtual "Who's iho"

of organized crime leaders

between California and the Midwest.

(BRADING AND! PRATIANNO)

of these top Hafia men listed with Brading (Braden) perhaps

the most important one is James Fratianno, also widely known

as "Jimmie The Heasel." Fratianno was known as perhaps the

Maria's highest ranking executioner in the nation.

Captain Hamilton told the Rackets Committee that his Intelligence

Division had linked Jinnie Fratianno to at loast sixteen Mafia

cxccutions.".

Fratianno had

once been arrested for the attempted

assassination

of: bos Angeles dafia head Mickev Cohen in 1919! Conen had

survived the bloody shooting which took the life

its lieutenants. Fratianno uns later relensca due to insul

ficient evidence. Fratianno used the alibi that he had been

at the home of Mafia associate Nick Licata the night of the

shooting. Licata later became the new head of the Los Angeles

naila, and, perhaps significantly, was later given control of

the Matia in Dallas, Texas.

jimmie Fratianno vas also suspoctod of complicity in

men in 1951. Two men who made the

mistake of robbing the Mafia's Flamingo Hotel in Las

Vegas were found dead in a parked car folloving the

robbery. Both, of their skulls had boen shattered by

bullets firod bohind the ear, apparantly in true Mafia

fashion.

Pratianno had

also been linked to the famous murder of

Harry "Hooky" lothman,

who had baen another close

associate of lickicy Conen,

the. Los Angeles Mafia head.

Fratianno was also linked to the disapocarance of

another top member of the riiclicy Cohen gang, Frank Hiccoli.

Naccoll had mysteriously vanished following a late dinner

at Fratianno's home one night.

, Fratianno, was also linked to the brutal murder of a business-

man in northern California in 1952. Thomas leen, a wealthy

gambler, had apparantly welched on a $30,000 gambling debt

that he

owcd the Halla,

and

was blown to bits from a dynamite

charge hiddon under the hood of his car.

Fratianno later corved a six year prison term (1954-1960) for

extortion. In later years

Fratianno bocane the central figure

involved

in LOOK magazine's "exposc" of San Francisco kavor

Josenh aliotols alleged lafia connections. Look alleged that

Fratianno lad

becone a close friend of lavor dito and that

the Mayor had arranged for Pratianno to

receive loans of over

a bank where Alioto sorved as Chairman of the

Board. Midtoj admitted that Fratianno vas a "casual acquaintance"

of his, but denied that he had used any influence in the loans.

The hayor also said that he had not known that the notorious

Fratianno was"

. a nember of the Matia.

(BRADING AID HELTZER)

while in Lois ngeles, Brading (Jin Braden) also became

connected with top Mafia leader Harold "Happy" Meltzer.

The LAPD Intolligence Division had originally become

avarc of Brading's close rclationship with lieltzer ven

Brading's nane was found on leltzer's Christmas card list.

Heltzer was widely known as one of the most powerful lafia

leaders in the entire nation.

The U.S. Sonate Packets Committee identified Brading's

racketeering and narcotics.

Jim Braden:

Possible Link to Jack Kuby

The same inadequate investigative work which led the

Harren Commission to largely overlook Jack ruby's solid

Malla involvement, appears also to have soch responsible

for the failure to uncover Jim. Braden's true identity of

sugone Brading during the official invostigation into

kennedy assassination.

the

As shown in the previous account of Jack Rubylf very

substanti

al ties to

the riafia, Ruby was particularly

involved in

the syndicate areas of gambling and narcotics.

But beyona

the multiplicity of evidence which

that

indicates

Jach: Ruby and Jim Braden wore both important rafia

figures opcrating in

the same general arcas, at the same

general

times,

there is another single piece of evidence

which

nlades both Ruby and Braden at the samel place on the

day bafore

the assassination.

Evidence indicates that both Jim Braden and Jack Ruby

visited the Dallas offices of the lal. Hunt Old Company

on the afternoon! of Hovember 21, 1963, just twenty four

hours before the President was murdered. Obviously any

link which places both Bradon and Ruby in the

sane place

at the sano time

on the day,before the assassination does

of courselraise further significant questions

possible

clationship between the two men.

Jiin

Praden

received permission from the U.s. Board of

Parole inllios ingeles to make a trip to Dallas! Texas on

November 13!

Four days before the assassination.

Braden was required

to report all of his travels to his

Parole Board following his parole in 1959 for the embez-

zlement conviction.

on November 21, 1903, the day before the assassination,

Jim Braden chocked in with the U.S. Parole Office in

Dallas. According to Roger Carroll

the Chief Parole

officer in ballas, Braden (Brading) "advised that ne

planned to sue Lamar lunt and other oil speculators while

hore." Lamar Hunt is the son

of hi.L. Hunt, the famous

right-ving oil billionaire.

l'aul Rothermel, a former FBl agent ho was Dircctor of

security for the hunt oil Connany in Dallas atthat time,

has recalled that he distinctly remembers Braden visiting

the fiunt offices. on November 2i in the company of three

other men!!

Pothermol has stated that the office 1o0

ilovember 21 showed that Roger Bauman.

(Bradinai's oli

for

friend!) and liorgan Brown and Duane towlin "ana!

Mafia

friend"

visited the lunt office on that afternoon. Rothermel states.

that Braden was definitely the "friend."

liccurity chief roul Rothermel was Inter firediby Mob. Hunt's

reports allegedly surfaced that Rothermel was

"suspicious" of a possible Hunt connection to the assassin-

ation. Following his

termination by the lints, rothermel

found that he vas being illegally wiretapped. Rothermel

Illed suit againot Lamar Hunt and another onelof l.I. Hunt's

sons,

chargang then with the wiretapring, and asking for

several mallion dollars in damages. The suit, which has

produced very danging cvidence against the lunt brothers,

is still

in the courts.

Also on November 21, the day before the assassination,

accordang to a conclusion of the Warren Commission, Jack

Ruby was also on his way to the Mod. munt ofrices In Dallas.

The

Warren 'Commission concluded that Jack Ruby arove a woman

friend of his to the lunt offices sometime that same after-

noon. The woman, who had declined work in Ruby's nightclub

23 0

stripper,

drove with Ruby to the lunt offices, apparantly

in scarch o

criployneni. This does coincide with Braden's

visit to tho

same offices on that same afternoon.

The warrch Comminsion investigated severnl other possible

including the still

unernlaingal fact that Lamar Hunt's name was found insidc

one of RupylE notebooks. But of these possible linls, the

Warren Commission concluded only that evidence did indicate

that ruby had driven to the lunt offices on rovenber 21.

Thus a possible Ruby-Braden connection on theiday before

the President's assassination doas indeed arise.

Jim Bracien

rossible link to David Ferric

Investigator Peter Moyes has turned un severall pieces

of Information which indicate a possible connection

between

Jim Braden

and the mysterious David Ferris.

David Forric was the homosekual airline nilot and private

investigator whom Jim Garrison accused of participating

in the plot to assassinate President Kennedy.

Six days after

found dead in his apartment in New Orleans. His

mysterious death was finally ruled to have beon a suicide.

David Forgie has boon a taraot of investigation by critics

of the lauren Commission ever since the assassination. In

Fact the aBI and Sccret Service both investinated a possible

Ferrie role immediatoly after the assassination. It was

widely rumored in How Orloans and Dallas. that Ferrie vas to

have

the

alleged assassins out of the country folloving

the assasgination. The Warren Commission decided not to include

the official secret service and FBI reports on forric in the

of licarings which vere rolcased after the tarren

the Justice Denartment did finally

release those renorts io the National Archiveslin 1967 following

Garrison's public accusations.

juthor Hoyes has since established that both Jin Braden and

Davod

Forrie

worked

out of theyfloor of officos in a building

in Now Orleans in the month or two immediately preceding the

assassination.

This is particularly significant due to the lact that at that

time

the mysterious David Ferrie was emploved as a private

investigator by Carlos Marcello, the top Hafia kingvin. It

is widely

believed by most fedoral authoritics

marcello rants with his

the two single most powerful Icaders of the dafia's national

2nd

intornational crime syndicate. Carlos Marcello heads the

l'afia empire contered in New Orleans, Louisiana, and controls

most of the Mafia activity in the southern

States.

In Septenber and October of 1963, just weeks before the

assassination, David Forrie was

working out of the offices

Jim

Braden: Author Petor loves And Judae Byrne

Peter Noyes, the investigative reporter who uncovered

most of the

material regarding Jim Braden (lugone Brading),

is a former classmate and close friend of Judge latthew

Byrne

the U.S. District Court Judgo who presided

over the Ellsberg. Pentagon Papers trial last year.

As is now well know, Judge Byrne dismissed the case

against allsher

after he was notified that the white

House, "Plumbers" had once burglarized the office of

Ellsberg's psychiatrist.

A chort time lator, it became known that President Nixon

had twice instructed John Chrlichman to annroach judge

Byrne during the course of the bllsberg trial and offer him

the rosition of Diroctor of the FBI. This offer, which Judge

Byrne refused, has been regarded as a potential act of

bribery by some critics of President lison,:

and is currently

investigation by the soccial Frosecutor's Office.

It has been widely assumed that llixon's fervent interest

in the outcone or

the prosecution of Ellshero. may have

been the motivation behind his approach to Judge byrne.

Author Hoyes has written of his friend Judge Byrne's

involvement in his research on Jim Braden. In 195?, after

loyes had accumulated much of his information regarding

the mysterious Bracien, he took the information to hi

richd, Matt tyrne, who was then U.s. Attorney for southern

california. loyes had several talks with Byrne, and has said

that Byone was

very impressed by the substantive evidence

which loves had gathered. During one of these nectings with

Byrnc and another FBI man whom Byrne had invited to attend,

the FBI man told. Noves that the FBI had never before linown

haa nave poore thoma

that jim Braden - the man arrested at the seche of the

assassination in 1903 - was actually Surenc Brading. The

FBI man said that the bureau must have made la big mistake

in not tracing down Braden's true idontity and nolice record.

the FBI man was nearly incredulous over loves'i

evidence on

Braden.

loyer meanwhile had discovored that Jim Braden had also been

in Los ingeles on the night that Robert Kennedy was assassinated

in carly June of 1968.

Though loyes couldn't find any significant information indicating

any Braden connoction to the second kennedy murder, he and his

friend Hatt Byrne forwarded the information on Braden to the

Special Unit of the IMPD which was investigating: the REk death.

The pocal. Unit of the maey, according to royes, aiu-

counted the infornation rcamling the Rili asanssination,

but was indeed impressed by the Braden connection

to the

1963 assassination. Hoyes writes that Judge Byrne never

heard anynore about it after he forvarded

the information

to tho RFK investigators.

LIEBENGOOD ROUTH NOTES FROM U. S. V. VECIANA, ET AL

DATE:

December 1, 1976

Veciana

was represented by Barry L. Garber,

1040 City National

Bank Building,

25 West Flagler Street, Miami, Florida 33130

(305-377-4963)

Veciana became implicated as the result of a drug bust

of one Augustine Barres, a/k/a/ Emidigio Augustine Barres Fangul

("'Gus Barres").

The bust resulted from an search warrant of

23 July 73 for Barres'

York.

attache case at the Taft Hotel in New

The police were acting on an informant tip to an under-

cover agent who arranged for a buy from Barres of seven kilograms

Go seven grams

of Cocaine

at the

Taft. The police understood that Barres was

to

be with a "female"

courier. Barres advised DEA task force re-

presentative, Eugene W. Flynn, a detective sgt. with the Nird,

that he purchased the

seven kilos from Antonio Veciana in Miami

on July 21, 1973.

Barres owns a home in Puerto Rico and travels to New York

every two weeks on business.

A co-defendant of Veciana's in the case was Ariel Pomares

who is the President of Occidental Investment, a real estate

firm owned by Barres,

located at 1186 J. T. Pinero Avenue,

Miami. Pomares is also involved with FRECA Imports in Puerto

Rico. This is also a Barres enterprise.

The DEA Miami regional office cables that Veciana is the

subject of INS File No. A12-490987 and that he claims to be a

public accountant.

According to the Miami Herald of July 25, 1973, Barres was

Assistant Secretary of Communications under Castro and Later the

general manager of the Havana Health Department.

He fled Cuba

in 1961 for asylum in Puerto Rico. He became a United States

citizen in 1970.

A cable from Ivan Wurms, the Chief Investigator of the DEA

Task Force to Durkin at DEA headquarters, Washington, states that

Veciana was arrested without incident on

- 7/24/73 and signed a

"consent to search" form.

Subpoena of August 14, 1973 exists for a telegram billed to

Veciana at 649-1226 and sent to Barcelona, Spain on 5/26/73.

Barres implicates a Paraguyan diplomat formerly assigned

to LaPaz, Bolivia and reassigned to Spain in the drug traffic.

DEA is discretely checking his identity.

A follow-up cable

from DEA indicates that they have failed to identify the Paraguyan

diplomat sent to Spain but do indicate that a Pedro P. Medina,

a Paraguyan assigned to LaPaz, is believed to be involved in

Cocaine smuggling.

Barres admitted that he was responsible for bringing Pomares,

an employee of his, into illegal drug activity.

Teciana claimed to be without funds and destitute and wa:

not fined. The U. S. Attorney was concerned that he posted

$100,000 baill immediately:

However, after initial concern being

shown in the file by the U. S. Attorney,

the U.S. Attorney later

writes

the

Judge that: $80,000 of the $100,000 bond was furnishe

by Veciana's cousin, Dr. Péeblo Zalduendo, a phytian from Detroit,

Michigan.

The remainder of the bail money was furnished by Veciana's

nole and other family members and friends who cashed insurance

policies, closed children's savings accounts, etc.

U. S. Attorney

concluded that Veciana was possibly telling the truth when he advised

the Court that he was destitute.

from U.S. v. Veciana, et al, con't.

Barres says he requested the government to give immunity to

Veciana in

order to destroy the traffic of Cocaine from Bolivia.

Barres studied at Columbia Military Academy in Columbia,

Tennessee in 1951.

A taped transcript of Barres' debriefing by detectives

Flynn and Scamardella on July 25, 1973 reveals the following:

Barres got involved in drugs through his friend Veciana who was

of the International Development Bank in the U.s.

Embassy in Bolivia.

Some people think Veciana is with the CIA

but Barres does not know.

Barres dealt with Veciana regarding

an attempt to kill Castro in Chile.

He says Veciana did a good

job of transferring everything into Chile (1970-1971).

gave Veciana $2,000 in support of this assassination effort.

About this time Veciana said that drugs could be smuggled out of

Bolivia through diplomatic pouch.

Barres thought this was how

Veciana had sent weapons into Chile.

Barres advised that the head

of Interpol in Bolivia gets a cut of drug money for protection on

the Bolivian end and that a Secret Service Agent and

two Paraguyan

diplomats were also involved.

They handled the transfer to

Veciana in Miami Beach of the drugs from Bolivia.

Barres thought that the individual he was

selling the drugs

to in New York was a mafia

type. It appears this is the indi-

vidual who informed the police.

He is known only as Tony in the

transcript.

The police were aware of his identity but did not

desire Barres to discuss it.

Pomares' counsel, Gustavo Del Toro, urged the DEA in San

Juan at the time of the arrest of Pomares to consider immunity

for Pomares

because

Pomares possessed valuable information re-

garding international narcotic trafficing, including the impli-

cation of diplomats in places such as Bolivia, Paraguay and

The file contains cancelled Veciana checks drawn on the

account of Antonio Sira Veciana at the Fidelity National Bank,

5880 Byrd Road, Miami, Florida, in May and June, 1972, for $1,000

each, payable to the Swiss Bank Corporation for account EF558230.

These checks were obtained through subpoena on Catherine Hune,

Vice President and Cashier of the Fidelity National Bank in Miami.

MEMORANDUM TO: File

RE: Antonio Veciana

FROM: Tom Moore

DATE: Jan. 3, 1977

Telephoned Veciana to ask if he recalled any

attempts on

his life in late 1962 or 1963..

He answered that

there were

three attempts on his ilfe, but none in 1962 or 1963. The

first attempt, he said, occurred in a stadium in

Puerto

Rico In 1967 when a bomb exploded approximately 20 meters

away. He said he belleved Puerto Rican communists

were

responsible for this attempt. The second attempt

occurred

in Bolivia In approximately 1970 when some men with weapons

appeared at a home where he was supposed to be.

He said a

woman who owned the home called him to warn him.

He said

he thought this attempt was related to a revolution which.

was taking place at that time. The third attempt,

he said,

occurred in Caracas, Venezuela In 1971. He added that he had

received information within the past three months

that Castro

wanted to kidnap him.

The only relevant incident in late 1962 or 1963 was that

an Isobel Zarate began making inquiries about him in Miami. He

said many people in the Cuban community informed the FBI she

was a Castro spy and that she subsequently escaped to Cuba via

Mexico.

I. Carry-over from Church report

A. Relationship between agencies and Warren Commission

1. Warren Comm. staff has never been interviewed in

depth.

Many have not been interviewed at all. The

Commission had particular staff assigned to (a) Cuba

and (b) organized crime. They, especially, should be

fully debriefed about everything that happened in their

contacts with the agencies, their frustrations, unful-

filled leads, inability to get access, questionmarks,

and what they knew, heard, or suspected about contacts

at high-level between Commission members and top agency

officials. This would include leads to additional

documents, memoranda and people, and is especially

important in the time-frame just before the Commission

issued its report, i.e. as final drafts being written,

when staff learned for the first time about Castro's.

threat.

(Willens, staff director, said there were staff

pushing hard to re-open this

subject, but pressure of

getting the report out prevailed.)

2. Look for all other memoranda of contacts between

McCone and CIA re how to structure questions, etc.

3. We now know that Ruby was contacted svereal times

by: FBI

to inform on axganisadxexinexinxBattaxaxeax

Know thon

{"criminal element" in Dallas area. All we've seen

is the cummary memo in which Wareen Commission was

so informed.

Get each memorandum of contact between

FBI agents and Ruby, i.e. underlying materials which

"support" the summary memo.

B. The inter-agency committee which met to develop

continegncy plans in the wake of Castro's threat.

1. Numerous documents were sought from FBI, CIA.

Defense, State, etc., but never received by Church

Committee before our final report was issued.

Must

follow-through, and then go deeper into it.

2. What else was known besides Castro's retaliation

threat? What facts went into the assessment that

Castro might retaliate against U.S. leaders in Latin

America, but not U.S. leaders in the U.S.? Precisely

what accounted for the/* original inclusion of

a concern about retaliation in the U.S., but the sub-

sequent deletion of that prospect?

Who was responsible

ior the deletion, and what impact, if any, did that

nave on the later of withholding of info from the

Warren Commission and on the agencies' failure to

investigate retaliation?

3. We

must find out exactly who was on this Committee

at each meeting, get all back-up materials, and interview.

## Page 83

C. FBI involvement in ½ Bay of Pigs, Lansdale planning, etc.

1.

As Church report was being completed, we were just

beginning to learn about how deeply the FBI was apparently

involved in U.S. anti-Castro action. Possibility

here that the this could provide another clue in re

•FBI's original reluctance to investigate retaliation

more| fully.

For instance we now know that FBI had

learned about CIA's interest in using organized

crime to kill Castro long before RFK toldkaupxx

Hoover about it (Hoover had professed surprise in

1963m, but there's

some indication he may have already

known) .

One FBI witness even told us that a high FBI

official # had even proposed the plot idea "in jest".

At a minimum,

the paper record shows FBI waSxEnntarted

taxpaxidux&uhanxintutt; informed about idea of using

org. crime figures to provide Cuban intelligence and

that, according to the paper record, FBI recommended

against it.

Trafficante has now claimed that FBI agents

came to him

seeking Cuban intelligence. This must be

followed up, agents interviewed, and FBI memo's, etc.,

examined.

D. CIA files

I always had the impression that Jim Johnston felt

there were more CIA documents which he hadn't seen.

We must go over the itmes, one by one, with Johnston,

to find out just where we stand on the question of

out just where

whether or o not were seen everything. Do any of us

really fully understand the entire CIA filing sustem

so as to know whether we'vey been shown everything, or

indeed, whether they have even as a-ne looking for

everything.? And how about the

Date: Sept. 16, 1976

Subject: Review

of CIA documents presented the SCI by Jack Anderson

The documents recently received by this Committee,

from Jack

Anderson, had previously been reviewed by the Church Committee staff.

The documents appear to be a few of those requested for FOIA review

by David Belin. It is my understanding,

after these documents were

declassified, David Belin furnished copies to both David Martin (AP)

and Jack Anderson.

The Church Committee was permitted to review thel'entire Oswald

201 file, the AMLASH file, Garrison files and selected Office of

Security

files. The Committee primarily concerned itself with the

early period of the investigation (November 1963 - October 1964), as

assassination of resident Kennedy. However, Intormation relating to

their files. The Oswald 201 does not attempt to question Oswald's

connection with both pro-Castro and anti-Castro groups'or any of

the AMLASH information. The most notable subject missing was inform-

ation relating

to CIA/U.S. Government attempts to assassinate Fidel

Castro.

Jack andesort livers dilerse

Four and a half years ago, I broke a story that now is belatedly rocking

Washington.

I reported that the Central Intelligence Agency had recruited two

Mafia figures, John Roselli and Sam Giancana, to assassinate Cuban Premier

Fidel Castro.

I tracked down Roselli and questioned him about the story. He had nothing

to say. He promised me, however, that he would give me his exclusive story

if he should ever be free to talk.

Yesterday, John Roselli told his story -- first to the Senate Intelligence

Committee in secret session, then to me as he had promised four and a half

years ago.

Roselli is a dapper, hawk-faced man with a thatch

of white hair. He has

been disciplined all his life to keep his mouth shut. His Mafia partner,

Sam Giancana, was slain before Senate investigators could serve him with

a subpoena.

So it was obviously painful for Roselli to talk. I promised I would make

clear that he revealed no names, except for the CIA contacts whose identities

the Senate already knew.

So here, is Roselli's own account of a real-life "Mission Impossible" --

the attempt to kill Castro.

It is a story of cash payments, poison pellets,

high-powered rifles and powerboat dashes to Cuba.

The plot against Castro, Roselli said, began in 1960 -- when Dwight

Eisenhower wa's President,

Richard Nixon was Vice President and Allen Dulles

was the ClA chief.

Roselli was recruited

in Los Angeles, he said, by Robert Maheu, then an

aide to billionaire Howard Hughes. Previously, Maheu had operated a CLA

front in Washington.

AW 50955

DocId: 32423630 Page 96

## Page 95

Page 2.

According to Roselli,

the murdered mobster, Sam Giancana, never became

involved in

the assassination plot. He knew about it; he may even have suggested

a Cuban contact;

nothing more.

Roselli identified the CIA project officer, in charge of the Castro

assassination, as "Big Jim" O'Connell. Maheu put Roselli in contact with

O'Connell, as Roselli remembers it, in New York City on September 14, 1960.

Thereafter, Roselli flew to Miami and recruited the assassination squads.

At first, they plotted to poison Castro.

Poison pellets were supplied by the CIA.

They were delivered to the plotters in a Miami hotel room, according to Roselli,

by Maheu. He dramatically opened his briefcase, revealing $10, 000 in cash

and the fatal pellets.

The money was distributed tothe Cuban plotters.

Roselli swore he never

took any money from the CIA, except for some incidental expenses. He paid the

big expenses, he said, out of his own pocket.

The poison pills were supposed to take three days to work. Supposedly,

this would give the poison time to work its way out of Castro's system before

he died, and his death would be attributed to natural causes.

Roselli never found out what happened to the plotters or the pellets.

But

they tried again later with a

stronger dose of poison.

Not long afterward, reports

reached them that Castro was desperately ill. Roselli doesn't know whether the

illness was caused by the poison of a virus. But Castro survived, and the

plotters apparently did not.

Toselli said he also picked up intelligence, which he submitted to the CIA

NW 50955

both during the Bay of Pigs planning and the later Cuban missile crisis. After

the Bay of Pigs, Roselli said, Maheu was cut out of the plot.

Thereafter,

Roselli reported to a CIA agent named William Harvey.

There were four made ascassination attempts, the plotters were smuggled

The headless,

handless body

that

floated into a Miami canal last month

reminded Minnium of that other, simi-

larly mutilated body that turned up

last December. And who can forget

the man who got angry with his room-

mate,

sliced him up and tossed the

parts along a highway? !!

As it turned out, Roselli's wasn't the

first body to float into the annals of Mi-

ami crime in a drum, Minnium says.

Ten years ago a lovers' quarrel re-

sulted in a man stuffing his girl friend

into a drum, filling it with cement and

Aqua Velva shave lotion. The drum

was found resting against a dike and

justice was eventually done.

Minnium is not pleased by such vio-

lent antics.

"We don't appreciate people com-

mitting murder and dumping a body

in our county, regardless of who the

people are, but especially if it's organ-

ized crime." Minnium says.

His department handled 168 homl.

1976, the percentage was even higher,

standing at about 92 per cent.

is solved. In the last four weeks, with

the help of Washington agencies, Za.

Roselli's life in hopes of understanding

his death. For the third time in eight

years of marriage, Latrepalek worked

out of town on his wedding anniversa-

That Johnny Roselll was destined to

walk on the dark side of life never

seemed in doubt. As a teen-ager in Bos-

ey. He was arrested at age za for steal-

ing about $25 from someone. Then he

changed his name and left for Chica-

до.

It would be 40 years until, in the late

1960s, Johnny Roselli would see his

mother again, though he sent money

to his tamily through an intermediary

in Chicago so his sisters could attend

college.

By the late 1920s Al Capone was well

established in Chicago.

Newspaper-

men, politicians and cops were on the

Capone payroll and a young man with

Roselli's street savvy had little trouble

finding suitable employment; he hired

on as a rumrunner with the Capone

gang. At age 26 Roselli was arrested

for selling morphine to an undercover

agent. He was acquitted because, after

Roselli's arrest, no one could seem to

tind the arresting officer or informant

in the case. They still haven't been

found.

"In the 1940s the sheriff of Dade County (which

includes most of the Miami area) admitted to the

Kefauver organized crime committee that, since

he had become sheriff on an annual salary of

$12,000 five years earlier, his personal fortune

had increased from $2,500 to $70,000."

women, friendly with men of money,

moved to Los Angeles. He wore hand-

tailored suits and, by all accounts, was

easygoing,

mild-mannered. He was

married for a time to an actress, but

they had no children. He became a

close friend of Harry Cohn, the legend-

ary head of Columbia Pictures. The

two men sometimes

vacationed to-

gether and Roselli always seemed to

know how to place a bet should Cohn

care to wager on a horse.

According to Bob Thomas' biogra-

phy of Cohn,

"King Cohn," the movie

mogul once offered Roselli a job as a

producer. (In his book,

Thomás dis-

guised Roselli's identity at Roselli's re-

quest.)

"What would you pay me?" Roselli

asked Cohn.

"Five

hundred dollars a

Cohn said.

week,"

"I get that much

from

waItresses

who take bets for me," Roselli is said to

have replied.

Besides being a handy man with the

placing of bets, Roselli purchased al26

per cent interest in a Tijuanal race-

track with $25,000 Cohn loaned him.

Roselli paid him back promptly and in-

cluded a check for 6 per cent interest;

Cohn magnanimously tore up the in

terest check.

Roselli bought twin star rubies, had

them set in rings and gave one to

Cohn, who considered it a good luck

charm until his death. Once, when Chi-

cago mobster Willie Bioff moved to

Hollywood and began making life mi-

serable for movie studios by shaking

down executives in return for labor

peace,

Roselli stepped in and saved

Cohn from a lengthy strike.

When Cohn refused to pay tribute to

Bioff and bis union, Bioff tried to halt

production at Columbia by calling a .

sudden strike. Desperate, Cohn called

Roselli who marched into Bioft's office

and confronted the hoodlum who sat

behind his desk wearing a hat and

coat, chomping on a cigar, a gun rest-

ing on the desk in front of him.

"Listen, Willie, I don't know what

you're trying to prove but it isn't going

.. to work,". Roselli told him.

"This is a

spite thing and you're not going to get

away with it. You meet with Cohn and

get it settled."

; Bioff backed down and called off his

pickets. After he was sent to jail for ex-

tortion, Bioff cut a deal with the gov.

ernment and named Roselli as a Chi.

cago mobster who had helped him

shake down movie studios. Cohn testi-

fied on Roselli's behalf, but in 1943 Ro-

selli was sentenced to 10 years in pris-

on. When he got out he returned to

Hollywood to make pictures of prison

and gangster life. But publicity about a

secret appearance before the Kefau-

ver crime committee ruined his rela-

tionship with most studios. Even Cohn

re fused to hire him-"The stockhold.

ers would scalp me," Cohn told a bitter

Roselli.

It was during his years in the Los

Angeles and Las Vegas areas that Ro-

selli met the man who would make

him a household name later in life.

Robert Maheu, the ex-FBI agent who

parlayed a Washington private eye

business into a stormy career as How-

ard Hughes' man in Las Vegas, ap-

proached Roselli on behalf of the CLA

in 1960

(Another person Roselli met in that

era who would later surface to talk of

Roselli, Giancana and John F. Ken-

nedy was a young party girl named Ju-

dith Campbell.)

Maheu and Roselli would later tell

Frank Church's Senate Intelligence

Committee the details of their plots to

kill Castro. Maheu told investigators he

had known Roselli since the late 1950s

and, while he didn't know of his un-

derworld connections,

"it was cer-

tainly evident to me that (Roselli) was

able to accomplish things in Las Vegas

when nobody else seemed to get the

same kind of attention."

Over dinner at the Brown Derby in

Beverly Hills 16 years ago, Maheu ex-

plained to Roselli that his government

needed his services. Roselli, who was

born on July 4, 1905, was nothing if not

patriotic. (Sam Giancana once said,

"Just wave a flag and Johnny'll follow

you to any canal.") Maheu recalled that

recommended to the CIA that it try to

prevent prosecution, but Roselli was

convicted of violating interstate gam-

bling laws. He went to jail, returning

in

1974 to Plantation

to

do battle

against government efforts to deport

him:

In 1971 the CIA asked the Immigra-

tion and

Naturalization Service

to

"forestall public disclosure of Rosell's

past operational activity with the CIA"

that might occur if deportation pro-

ceedings were pursued.

The INS

agreed to keep the CIA informed, but

at his death, Roselli and his lawyers

were still fighting deportation.

• #Bob Mahen must be running scared

I thought about that just the other.

day: 'Jesus, what's Maheu thinking?' "

said another of Roselli's brothers-in-

law, Peter Cardillo of New Jersey.

The public doesn't know what Ma-

heu is thinking, whether he worries if

pro-Castro Cubans are exacting retri-

bution for sins of 16 years ago. Maheu's

secretary in Las Vegas says she doesn't

know where her boss is or when he'll

be returning to his office. He report-

ediy has some business interest in

Egypt, a part of the world that seems

to hold some fascination for the Castro

plotters; Giancana kept an apartment

in Beirut and, just before his death,

told a friend he had some sort of deal

brewing there. And Roselli longingly

eyed the opening of gambling casinos

in the land of the new oil millionaires.

In Tampa, Santos Trafficante, an-

other of the original Maneu group, also

refuses to talk with the press. But unt

like the others, he did not testify be-

fore the Church committee so the pub-

lic has no inkling of his thoughts on

the Castro assassination attempts.

Whether Roselli's killing was one of

retribution for a public or a private

matter, Johnny Roselli was a testa-

ment to an era that has passed. His life,

which would have remained largely

unnoticed save for the Senate's CIA

hearings, seemed straight from the

pages of a Mafia novel: allegedly

brought into the United States illegally

at the turn of the century, Roselli

clawed his way from the mean streets

of Boston and Chicago to the relative

glamor of Hollywood, Las Vegas and

finally, Miami. Along the way, a simple

AN INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER

Who Killed John Roselli?

Once there was a President who was murdered.

His brother was murdered too. A long time after they

died some very strange facts came to light. It turned

out that while they were running the government,

the government was frying to get two Mafia mobsters

to arrange the murder of someone else the head of

a small, hostile neighbor state. It also turned out that

one brother the one who was President-appar-

ently had a girlfriend who was the girlfriend as well

of the mobsters. And one of the mobsters, whose

nickname was Momo, was prominent on the list of

criminals the President's brother was trying to put in

jail. The story may sound complicated, but life is com-

plicated, and the complications in this case got even

more so. For when a committee of the Congress

wanted the two mobsters to come and tell them some-

thing about. all this, only one of them-the one

named Johnny came. The other one, Momo, was

murdered in his house a week before they wanted

amount to a system of justice which 1) only affects

those dumb enough to get involved in it in the first

place and 2) tends only to punish those who have

committed what the rest of us would regard as hei-

nous crimes anyway. Not that these are things people

say-they're things people can be expected to as-

sume. But we think in this case the assumptions have

even less validity than they would have on a clear

day, which isn't much. And that is because if we

know anything, we know that the Mafia operations in

which Messers. Giancana and Roselli figured had be-

come intertwined with the operations of the United

States government. Never mind that the decisions of

the early 1960s which made this so may rank among

the most abominable decisions ever taken in the U.S.

government. The plain fact is that, given the provoca-

tive and suggestive history of the two men, it is not

possible for either Congress or the Executive Branch

to look the other way or to complaisantly accept the

earmarks-of-a-gangland-slaying bromide.

ROSSELLI CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS

Meets Maheu at insurance friend's home.

Late July/early August. Maheu calls. Working for government. Recruit

Rosselli only.

Meet Brown Derby, L.A., for lunch. Long talk about

project in Cuba.

Rosselli wants

verification.

2nd meeting, L.A., discuss further details, no discussion of specific

techniques.

Plan

. to meet in N.Y. for verification.

Sept. 14, 1960. First meeting in N.Y. at old Plaza Hotel. Rosselli

introduced by Maheu to O'Connell.

Rosselli "Knew"' O'Connell worked

for the CIA. Rosselli agrees to work on Cuban project.

Sept. 25, 1960. Maheu and Rosselli travel to Miami to begin making

contact with Cubans to be recruited for mission.

(Between Sept. 25 and the Bay of Pigs, a series of recruitments, meetings,

and arrangements were made.

The following is an outline of events that

is not necessarily in chronological order.)

- Meeting where Maheu is introduced to Trafficanto. Meeting

where Maheu is introduced to Giancana.

Giancana was, according

to Rosselli, to only be a 'back up man." Rosselli states

Giancana had nothing to do with the actual operation. Trafficanto

was used, according to Rosselli, as a translator.

- Meeting with O'Connell, Maheu, Rosselli, and sortsle

discuss the Cuban project.

-- Rosselli, in his contact with the Cubans, "invents" the cover

- Bog that no here

story that he represents some Wall Street business interests who

want to see Castro eliminated. Rosselli trusts Cubans he has

recruited because they are part of the Bay of Pigs operation.

-- Ist attempt at assassination involved the use of pills. Maheu "

and Rosselli met with Cuban #1 and #2 (?). Maheu opened up his

briefcase and gave the pills with instructions for their use to

Cuban #1. Maheu also had $10,000 he gave the Cubans for doing

the project. Rosselli did not know of the money. Rosselli states

he received no remuneration for his work on the project, in fact,

he paid out $800 for gas for a speed boat to deliver two or three

man parties for guerrilla raids into Cuba.

-- Prior to Bay of Pigs there was no discussion of using guns to

assassinate Castro.

-- Rosselli's cover name was "John Ralston."

- At different times, Cuban #1, #2, or #3 would propose different

in Havana.

-- Eventually, Rosselli felt the project had failed. There was no

specific point when it was announced. But, at sometime Rosselli

assumed the project, for whatever reason, had not succeeded.

1961

After the Bay of Pigs (April 1961)

Rosselli felt "sorry for the poor bastards, left on the

pate in the invasion Two or three weeks lafter the

invasion, Rosselli was contacted in Los Angeles by

O'Connell, a meeting was arranged for at the airport

Rosselli went there and was introduced

to Harvey. O'Connell said Harvey was now in charge of

the Cuban

project.

Harvey told Rosselli he was to cease

all contact with Maheu and Giancana.

Further, Harvey

stated that the government was still interested in using

Rosselli for intelligence-gathering operations..

Rosselli

would report information from the Cubans to Harvey about

personalities and events in Cuba.

Rosselli would also

relay on to his Cuban contacts requests for specific in-

formation from the CIA.

Sometime between the Bay of Pigs invasion

and the Cuban

missile crisis, Harvey gave Rosselli six poison capsules.

Rosselli, in turn, gave them to his Cuban| contacts who

to Cuba, where another Cuban or Cubans

would use them to assassinate Castro. Rosselli never

learned the details of what happened, but the project ob

viously failed. At one point, Rosselli remembers hearing

over the radio that Castro was very 111!

A short time

later, he recovered.

Sometime before the missile crisis, Rosselli arranged,

pursuant to Cuban #1 request, for a van loaded with rifles

and ammunition to be delivered in Florida. O'Connell and

Rosselli watched the Cuban contact pickup the van and

rose i watches

return it empty.

Rosselli assumed that these guns were

going to be used by the two or three-man raiding parties

in Cuba to assassinate Castro and overthrow the government.

During the Cuban missile crisis, Rosselli was in Chicago.

He contacted Harvey at Harvey's mother's home in Indian-

apolis and left his number in Chicago. (Harvey then callec

nim, told him to go to Washington, D.C./ From Washington,

D.C., Rosselli traveled to Florida where he stayed for

the duration of the Cuban missile crisis. He, at times,

would, through his Cuban contacts, attempt to verify the

Rosselli claimed

that this had been successful. After the Cuban missile

crisis, Harvey called Rosselli and told him to stop all

contacts with any and all persons involved in past Cuban

missions.

Harvey never stated why the missions were being

called off.

Rowan Tap

Rosselli said that he understood that Giancana had

asked Maheu for a tap on Dan Rowan. Maheu gave

Rosselli two stories.

The first was that he was

doing Giancana a favor and the second was that there

was a real intelligence value in that Maheu was

afraid that Giancana or Rowan might be giving out

intelligence information that would be of value to

enemies of the United States.

Rosselli had not heard

of the names Dubois or Belotti or Fred Harrison.

admitted that Harvey had discussed the tap with him,

but both Harvey and Rosselli were mad that the opera-

tion had gone on.

Giancana obviously knew about the

tap. Maheu did ask Rosselli to get bail money for

the two tappers who were caught and thrown in jail.

Maheu suggested that Rosselli could get a hotel to

turn over the bail money. Finally, Rosselli arranged

to have a man with a green carnation in his lapel

meet and transfer the bail money. He never received

any of this money back.

Rosselli claims that he did

not know what type of tap went on.

He admitted that

he had been questioned by the FBI but he gave no

answers.

Rosselli knew that Maheu had been questioned

by the FBI.

Roselli

First,

some background information. Yesterday,

August 9, Senators Inouye and Baker met with Directors

Kelley and Bush to discuss Roselli's death. The FBI

doesn't want to touch this with a ten-foot pole.

At the

meeting, Jim Adams told Inouye and Baker that the FBI had

been told by Justice (Richard Thornburg) that it had no

jurisdiction in this case. Levi had, apparently,

not been

consulted.

Senators Baker and Inouye (especially Baker)

requested Kelley to take this up directly with Levi. Today,

a letter was sent to Levi, signed by Baker and Inouye, urg-

ing Justice to authorizé FBI involvement. A copy

of that

letter is

attached.

One other point about the meeting. George Bush was

extremely upset about this case and the allegations that

the CIA was involved in Roselli's death. He said that he

would personally contact Levi to request that the Depart-

ment grant jurisdiction to the FBI to investigate.

For your information, Roselli appeared before the

Committee on four separate occasions to testify on three

matters.

He appeared on June 25 to discuss the plots against

Castro;

September 20 and 22 to discuss the Campbell

affair;

and on April 25 to discuss the retaliation theory.

Now for current events. First, the two detectives in

Miami handling the Roselli case are Detectives Zatrefralek

and Wolf. They are with Dade County Homicide.

Their numbers

are 305-547-7456 and 547-7923. Madigan has already talked

with Detective Wolf. Second, in light of the Inouye/Baker

letter to Levi I did not ask the FBI about the current

whereabouts of Santo Trafficante. I did, however, ask CIA.

They have no information. Third, Baker and Liebengood are

putting

together a packet of information on Roselli, which

will include CIA and Select Committee information and will

get this

to you tomorrow.

I

think you already know this, but Senator Baker does

want to launch an informal investigation into this matter.

Roselli told him, when he appeared before the Committee, that

he thought his life

was, in danger for testifying.

PATRICK SHEA AND MICHAEL MADIGAN

JUNE 21, 1975

SUMMARY OF A MEETING WITH MR. JOHN ROSSELLI

BEGAN Al A11:35 a.m., JUNe 21, 1975, IN ROOM 711 Of the WAlERGATE HOTEL.

PRESENT AT THE SESSION: MR. MICHAEL MADIGAN, MR. PATRICKI SHEA OF THE SELECT

COMMITTEE

STAFF,

, MR. ROSSELLI, MR. THOMAS WADDEN, MR. JAMES CANTILLON, MR. LESLIE

SCHERR.

At the beginning of the meeting, Mr. Madigan asked Mr. Rosselli if he felt

a need for any protection. He stated; emphatically, 'No,"' that he was able to

ake care of himself Mc. Madigan made it clear that the Senate Select Committee

could provide U,S, Marshalls for Mr. Rosselli during his stay in Washington.

This offer

was

rejected.

Mr. Rosselli stated that Giancana had no involvement,

to his knowledge,

the attempted assassinations of Fidel Castro. Maheu did deal with

higher authorities in government but stated that Rosselli was only the contact,

Giancana has a backup man. Rosselli was very concerned about the adverse

publicity in

recent times, about the CIA and he thought it was unfortunate from

the Agency"S

point of view that the Giancana name had been linked to the Agency.

Rosselli was upset by the harassment he had been under by the FBI. He

pointed to the 1966 Frier Club incident as an example. He said in 1966 he had

been approached by the FBI to provide information on inside basis about organized

crime and when he had refused 18 months later he was indicted.

Again, the first

week in June of 1970, the FBI had offered him cooperation but he refused.

Rossell first met Maheu twenty years ago.

He was introduced through a

life long wriend who is dead now, named Spitzie, who was in the insurance business.

meeting happened in Los Angeles, in 1955. Maheu, at the time, was

running Maheul Associates in Washington, D.C. The meeting,was only a social

gathering. There was nothing specifically discussed about activities of the CIA.

In Juily or August,

, Maheu called Rosselli and stated that he was working for

the governient and had been specifically asked to recruit Rosselli.

Maheu Max

stressed that it was to be Rosselli and no one else.

They agreed to meet for lunch

at the Brown' Derby in Los Angeles. Maheu described the project as an intelligence

operation involving Cuba.

Maheu mentioned specifically Cástro, Che Guevara, and

Raoul Castro,.

It was Rosselli's feeling that Maheu had recruited him because of

his known Cuban connections in Florida.

These connections were unrelated to

gambling.

There was no money mentioned by Maheu to Rosselli for payment for

services.

The alleged support of Wall Street business men had not been mentioned and

was a cover invented by Roseelli later.

At the end of their first meeting, they

agreed to meet again at which time Maheu would verify to Rosselli that he was

working for the government. This verification would be by introducing a

government official of higher authority to Rosselli.

because New York was crawling with officials from all over the world. Rosselli

paid his own fare from Los Angeles to New York and stayed at the old Plaza Hotel

on Fifth Avenue and 57th Street. He was given the cover name, John Ralston.

The meeting in New York took place in a hotel room. In attendance were

Maheu, Rosselli and "big" Jim O'Connell, and two or three other people who

did not explain why they were there.

Jim O'Connell was introduced as a CIA

official. Rosselli was unclear as to whether this was stated explicitly or

whether through the whole context of discussions it became clear that he worked

for the CIAmiAt this point, Rosselli was satisfied that Maheu was working for

the particular projects.

After his stay in New york, he traveled to either Washington, b. C. or

Florida. Hellwas uncertain as to the exact location but he did remember there

were serieslof meetings between himself and Maheu to discuss further plans

about the attempted assassination.

There was only one further meeting with

O'Connell, involving these preliminary stages.

At this point,he only discussed

techniques of assassination with Maheu. Rosselli remembered staying in Maheu's

When

Rosselli reached Florida, he made his contacts with the Cubans and

then arranged for the Cuban's to meet with Maheu.

He trusted the Cubans he came

in contact with because they, according to themselves, were working on the Bay of

Pigs operation, which had not occurred as of yet. There were times when they would

stay at Arthur Godfrey's hotel. the Kenilworth Hotel, in Florida. At times he

registered under the name Rollans.

This was to allow him to maintain his cover

while Maheu, still working for Hughes, was able to register under his own name,

so that Hughes believed that he was doing his work.

The operation went on in

O'Connell, from

the CIA, would visit with Maheu and Rosselli.

One time, before the 1960 election,

O'Connell bröught with him two Admirals, one of whom, Rosselli thinks, was retired.

in seeing Castro done away with. The Cubans, at this point, had not met with im

O'Connell, but had met with Maheu. Inmediately after the Bay of Pigs, Maheu

left and Rosselli only met once more with O'Connell. Then he also left for the West

Coast.

The two attempts at assassination. both involved the use of pills. One attempt

was before the Bay of Pigs and the other was sometime after. " The first means was to

use a capsule filled with a special poison that could be spilled into the food of

would usually pick up the tab.

Harvey approached Rosselli with the proposed mission to try it for a second

time to assassinate Cubals]

Harver said that the new pills would really wark

six pills to his Cuban contact.

There were no special instructions on how'

At this time, Rosselli had no ongoing contact with Maheu, but may have run

into him in Los Angeles.

Maheu knew that Rosselli was still working on the Cuban

project and. that he, Maneu, was out.

Rosselli never got any report back on what

He stressed throughout the interview that he had never received any money and that

besides this $800 he had never given any money for. His last contact with Harvey

Mr. LIEBELER. Yes.

Mr. BRINGUTER. (Producing newspaper.] At the beginning of August in the

Mr. LIEBELER. For September 4, 1963?

Mr.

[Indicating photograph.] This Is the spy

who ras inside the training camp! The Christian Democratic Movement turned

bim over to the FBI, and the FBI ivas questioning him in Miami.

Democratic Movement found a letter, according to this information, from this

guy directedito Carlos Lechuga, former Cuban Ambassador to Mexico and now

Cuban Ambassador to the United Nations in New York.

In that letter the spy,

Fernando FInandez, was warning Lechuga that they have to be alert from that

date to August 8, and the day that Oswald came trying to infiltrate my orga-

nization Wasion August 5.

This sounds for me strange in all this matter.

(Indicating] Here is another interview from Fernandez here 3 days later.

Mr. BRINGUIER. Fernandez wrote a letter to Lechuga in Mexico.

Mr. TIERELER. Lechugn is a member of the Castro government?

Mr. BRINGIER. Right.

Mr. LIBELER. He is now Ambassador to the United Nations?

Mr. BRiNGUiER. In New Jork:; right.

Mr. LIEBeLer. Fernandez is the person who was the Castro spy who bad in-

Mr. BRINgUIeR. For the Christian Democratic Movement here In Loulsiana.

Mr. LIsBELeR. Now the Christian Democratic Movement, is-what? Pro-

Castro?

Mr. BRINdUIer. Anti-Castro.

Mr. LIEBELER. It Is an anti-Castro organization?

Mr. BRiQUeR. Yes; they were training Cubans over here'to make a com-

mando action against Castro, but they find out that there was a Castro spy

inside the, training camp, and they went back to Miami with the people and with

him, and they turn him over to the FBI.

I think that after that the leader

for the Chlistinn Democratic Movement-or that the FBI didn't found nothing,

because was not against the law to spy inside an anti-Castro orgunization.

It

was against the law to spy inside the U:S. Government but not inside the anti-

Castro organization.

And my feeling-and this is the question that I am asking

myself-in New Orleans we are about 900 miles from Miami:

In Mlami is wbere:

the headquarters of all the anti-Castro groups.

I could not find any reason

for Oswald to come to me and offer me his service to train Cubang In guerrilla

warfare at the same moment when there was i secret anti-Castro training camp

In New Orleans and a Castro spy was inside that training camp.

That for me

Is- because, if he was willing to infiltrate one active organization, he will go

directly to Mimi and he will offer his service over there in Minmi, but not in!

New Orleans where it is not publicly known tha here was something going on

at that moment.

I believe that that was the only time herelin New Orleans that

there was something like that, and it was a coincidence.

Andithere is another

coincidence

too for me, and that Is that when Oswald left; the city he went to

Mexico, and the letter from Fernandez that was Intercepted here was to. Mexico

too, and Oswald visit the Cuban consulate In Mexico, and the Fernandez letter

was to the Cuban Ambassador to Mexico,

For me, that is a big doubt.

Mr. LIeseLeR. Go ahead.

Mr. BRINGUIeR. You see, after the debate, the same night of the debate, I

went to the ??

radio station here in New Orleans and the local papers and the

United Press International office, and il gave a press release. ' If you want a

copy, I could gite you á copy.

I gave a copy to the Secret Service.

The most interesting thing is the four things that I asked to the Secret

Service of New Orleans. I think| that this is the second one where I sald,

"Write, to your Congressman asking for a full Investigation of Mr. Lee H

Oswald, a confessed Marxist' [producing document]. And that was 3 months

before the assassination.

Mr. LienatEs. Do you have another copy of this?

Mr. BRINGUIER: I have the original of that.

You can have that.

• Mr. LeBatER. I have marked a copy of the press release distributed to the

various communications media here in New Orleans, on August 16, 1963-

Mr. BRINGUIER! No, 'August 21.

Mr. LIEBELER. Let me go over some.of this testimony that' you have just

given to see lie I understand. Mr. Fernandez wrote to Mr. Lechuga a letter

in wbich Fernandez said that we meaning the Castro people?;

Mr. BRINdUIER Yes.

MIr. LIBBELER: Must be on guard up until August 8?

MIr. BRINOUIER. August 8, that is right.

Mr. LISBELER. Of 1903?

Mr. BRINOUTER.| That is right.

Mr. LIsBeLER. You indicated that Oswald had come to your store or offices

on August 5119632

Mr. BRINgUIER: That is right.

Mr. LIERELER. Oswald came to you offering to assist in the military training

of Cubans?

Mr. BRInGUIER. That is right.

MIr. LIBELER. At that time, there was, in fact, a training camp near New

Orleans-

Mr. BrinQUiEr. That is right.

Mr. LIEBELER.

For the training of people for military action against Castro?

Mr. BRINGURE I Right.

Mr. LIEBELER.

And that was not public knowledge at that time?

Mr. BRinGUIER, That is right.

Mr. LIBELER! So you are tying this up in your mind by considering the pos

sibility that Oswald was, in fact, a Castro agent?

Mr.

Brinduler. That is right.

Mr. LIEBeDER. And did know about the existence of this training camp, be

cause Mr. Fernandez had already himself infiltrated that training camp?

Fair Play for Cuba Committee materials on one uneventful oc-

casion in Dallas sometime during the period April 6-24, 1963,316

Oswald's first public identification with that cause was in New Or-

leans.

There.h

in late May and early June of 1963, under the name

Lee Osborne, he had printed a handbill leaded in large letters "Hands

Off Cuba," in application form for, and a membership card in, the

New Orleans branch of tle Fair Play for Cuba Committee.317

first distributed his handbills and other material uneventfully in the

vicinity of the U.S.S. Wasp, which was berthed at the Dumaine Street

wharf in New Orleans, on June 16, 1963.318 He distributed literature

in downtown New Orleans on August 9, 1963, and was arrested because

of a dispute Wich three anti-Castro Cuban exiles, and again on August

16, 1963.319 Following his arrest, he was interviewed by the police, and

at. his own request, by an agent of tlie FBI. On August 17, 1963, he

appeared briefly on a radio program 32 and.on August 21, 1963,

debated over

hadio station WDSU, New Orleans, with Carlos Brin-

quier, one of the Cuban exiles who had been arrested with him on

August 9,323

Bringuier claimed that on August 5, 1963, Oswald had

uttempted to lift rate an anti-Castro organization with which he was

associated. 32501115

While Oswald

publicly engaged in the activities described above,

his "organization" was a product of his imagination 3 The imaginary

president of the nonexistent chapter was named A. J. Hidell,as the

name that Osald used when he purchased the assassination weapon, 3o

Marina Oswald said she signed that name, apparently chosen because

it rhymed with "ridel, a to her hushand's membership card in the

New Orleans

sichapter. She testified that he threatened to beat her if

she did not do sö.32a The chapter had never been chartered by the

national FPCC organization. 330

It appeurs to have been a solitary.

operation on Oswald's part in spite of his misstatements to the New

Orleans police that it had 35 members, 5 of which were usually present

at meetings which were held once a month s301

Oswald's Fair Play for Cuba activities may be vierred as a very

shrewd political operation in which one man single handedly created

publicity for his cause or for himself. It is also evidence of Oswald's

describe events accuritely and of his need to present

himself to others as well as to himself in a light more favorable than

was justified by reality. This is suggested by his misleading and some-

time untruthfull statenents in his letters to Mr. V. T. Lee, then

national director of FPCC. In one of those letters, dated August 1:

1963, Oswaldi

wrote that an oflice which he had previously claimed to

have rented for FPCC activities had been

"promply closed 3 days

Inter for some obsure reasons by the renters, they said something

about remodeline ect, I'm sure you understand," 31 He wrote that

"thousands of

circulars were distrubed" 332 and that he continued to

receive inquiries through his post office box which he endeavored

"to keep ansevering to the best of my ability." sis In his letter to

V. T. Lee, he stated that he was then alonel in his efforts on behalf

of FPCC, but he attributed his lack of support to an attack by Cubun

407

exiles in a street deinonstration and being "officinly cautioned" by the

police, levents whiel

robbed me of what support I had leaving me

alone.". 334

In spite of those

claims, the Commission his not been able to un-

cover any evidence that anyone ever altacked any street demonstration

in which Oswald was involvell, except for the Bringuier incident men-

tioned above, which occurred, & days after Oswald wrote the above

letter to.V. T. Lee. 3 Bringer, who seemed to be familiar with many

anti-Castro activities in Ner Orleans, was not aware of any such

incident, 338 Police reports also fail to reflect any activity on Oswald's

part prior to August 9

$ 1963, except for the uneventful distribution of

literature at the Dimaine Street wharf in June 337

Furthermore, the

general tenor of Oswald's next letter to V. T. Lee, in which he sup-

ported his report on the Bringuier incident with a copy of the charges

made against him and a newspaper elipping reporting the event, sug-

gests that his previous story of an attack by Guban exiles was at/least

greatly exaggerated 335

"Vhile the legend "F PCC 541)Camp St. NEW

ORLEANS, LA." was stamped on some literature that Oswald had

in his possession at the time of his arrest in Neit Orleuns, extensive

investigation was notable to connect Oswald with that address, al-

though it did develop flie fact that an anti-Castro organization had

maintained offices there for a period ending early in 1962.339

The

Commission has not been able to find any other indication that Oswald

had rented an office in New Orleans.

In view of the limited amount.

of public activity on Oswald's part before August 9, 1963, there also

seems to be no basis for his claim that he lad distributed "thousands"

of circulars, especially since le had claimed to have printed only 2,000

and actually had only 1,000 printed. In addition, there is no evidence

that he received any

substantial amount of materials; from the na-

tional headquarters. 30

n another letter to MuT. Lee, dated August 17, 1963, Oswald wrot

hat he had appeare al

on iMr. Willium Stuckey's 15-minute television

program over TDSU-TV called "Latin American Focus" as a result

of which he was "flooded with callers and invitations to debate's ect.

be well as people interested in joining the TPC.C New Orleans

WDSU has no program of any kind called "Latin Ameri-

can Focus." 842 Stuckey had a radio program called "Latin Listening

Post," on which Oswald was heard for less than 5 minutes on August

17, 1963.313 It appears that Oswald had only one caller in response to

all of his FPCC activities, an agent of Bringier's attempting to learn

more about the true bature of the alleged FPCC "organization" in

New Orleans. 346

Oswald's statements suggest that he hoped to be flooded with callers

and invitations to debate. This would have made him a real center of

attention as he must have been when he first arrived in the Soviet Union

and as he was to somerextent when he returned to the United States.

The limited notoriety that Oswald received as a result of the street

fracas and in the subsequent radio debate was apparently not enough

to satisfy him. He exaggerated in his letters to V!,T. Lee in an appar-

information about the AMLASH operation.

This information was turned over to the

FBl which informed the CIA. Both

agencies interrogated Espinosa in June

of 1965 and found that he knew that

AMLASH and others were planning a coup

which involved the assassination of

Castro and that the CIA had been

involved with AMLASH and others in the

planning.

Espinosa and AMLASH were life-long friends

but during the interrogation he gave no

AMLASH-CIA meetings.

Espinosa's

information noted in the 1967 IG Report

operation and the CIA plots to assassinate

Castro using underworld contacts.

Therefore,

Espinosa's information raised

Castanyava was the chief of the Navy.

Well he was very fond of everything German. He

to pacify the tourists, the passengers on the ship

because they were terrified. They thought they were

So I helped my father pacify the

And he offered you a job, right?

Yes, after about 5 hours on board ship we went back

up to my father's cabin and had drinks and exchanged

very well. My father is diplomatic and they

The same day I arrived in New York. Because my

father took off that night for Germany again and

the phone ring, and it rang at l o'clock in the

morning.

I guess the previous...

Well he went back to Germany with the ship, right?

Where did you go?

I was living with my brother in New York City.

My brother was a translator for the United Nations

and I was alone living in New York City going to

the Merchantson Banker School.

Well how did you get back to New York City from

Havana?

On my father's ship.

It was the last stop on the

cruise of about 5 or 6 stops.

Oh, in other words the, in other words the ship left

that night, left Havana that night...

Yeah.

went over to New York and then from New York went

back to Europe, right?

Yes. I thought about Fidel and he pointed out

this is my Havana and I guess I was impressed.

was young, I don't know. And I thought that...

He called, he called you, he knew just about what

time you were going to arrive in New York and when

you got there he called you, what, the same, the same

day you got there?

The same day our ship arrived, three days later. And I

just picked up the phone and the Havana operator said

one moment please,

the Prime Minister is on the phone,

on the

line,

and

I heard some shouting and then I

heard "hello"

Did he speak Cuban or English to you?

He spoke broken English in his hoarse voice. I guess

he was giving a lot of speeches

at that time. And he

asked me, "Hello Marita, you think I don't call? I

think about you very much and I call. I keep my word.

I want to prove to you that one man's Cuban word I keep."

So,

I was

as surprised, I was very surprised.

How long was it did you leave New York to go to

Havana?

Fidel said to me, I said is this really you Fidel,

and he said yes.

I am in Havana Hilton, you call

me back in room 2408, and I said no, alright I

believe you I said because how else would you have

my number. He said "I want you come back.

I think

about you

and I will send

a plane,

my plane, and you

come back."

And it was a joke really, I liked the

Cocoa Glace, it's an ice cream in a coconut shell,

and he had sent to my father's ship a case of it so

I would have enough for the return trip home because,

I don't know, I just talked about Havana, the island

in general.

So I,

and I still didn't believe him

that he would send the plane.

Did he send the airplane?

Yes.

What kind of an airplane did he send?

A. Cubana airliner with...

Four engines?

and two men came to the, my door.

I was living at 344 West 87th Street at the time, on

the second floor, and my brother was at a UN party

and I was home alone studying.

Oh no, in fact I was

reading a Herbert L. Mathews article

on Fidel Castro

and Cuba when the doorbell rang, and it was Jesus

and they showed me identification.

One came in military

uniform,

one didn't.

I was driven by black limousine right to the Hilton.

And that's where Fidel was staying at the Hilton, right?

Yes, he was having an argument in his suite with Chez

Raoul and some Americans.

He was having some argument with some Americans. Do

Yes.

Who were they?

One lady attorney trying to promote something, Muriel...

Oh this was more business or something like that?

Yes business.

Everybody was trying to promote this

and that with Fidel.

Yes, well that's immaterial.

So then I was told to go in the room and wait and the

door locked

And I was in there, in his suite, and

Fidel came in and I missed him and he missed me and

the rest is going to be in the book if I ever write it.

You'll write it don't worry. Alright now...

If I live.

Do you know approximately when you met me?

A couple months, or two months, or three months after

that.

In the coffee shop.

In the coffee shop and this is when you were recruited

to go ahead and spy for the United States and so forth

and, were you ever introduced or, to Colonel Nickels?

Yes.

Do you know who Colonel Nickels is, right. He was

the Colonel who was military attache with the American

Embassy in Havana, Cuba at

that time, right?

Yes.

Okay.

Then you started your spy thing and so forth

and so forth, alright?

Um hum.

We'll go ahead and jump a little bit and so forth.

There were several meetings that Fidel had in the

Hilton with some of the people of the staff.

I was

present at the meeting, right?

Right.

And, one of the time that Fidel was talking to the

staff concerned the gambling casinos and American

business interests in Cuba, right?

You're gonna have all the American business interests

put pressure on the State Department which would put

pressure on him and that they would be up in arms and

they would have the agents, they would send new agents

To lead the revolution?

I was in his Cuba alright.

Right, now also what we were getting in this Senate

Intelligence Committee has got is the things that

Fidel has stated against the United States government

if they tried to interfere with the revolution and so

forth when the new election time comes because at that

time the President of the United States was Eisenhower

and it looked like that the Democrats were going to

win the election and he felt that if a new government,

which was discussed among the top military people, if

the new government came in and if they decided that they

didn't like Fidel's policy, which Fidel was saying what

he was going to do for Cuba on an international scale,

that if the United States government decided to go and

turn against him and put pressure on him he would do

likewise to the United States government. And he was

going to export his revolution in Latin America.

are the things that you heard...

We had, the building consisted of 300 units, which

300 apartments, my husband had access to files.

Each

Soviet file read the same -- Permanent Mission of the

Union of Soviet Socialist Republic resident, and I

got interested. Then one day an agent came

working with Treasury and other agencies, including

Yes, political. And, my husband had known him

previously working with the Polaris missile, Polaris

This was before I met my husband or

married him.

He did something with the Polaris

missile thing. And my husband was paid by this same

agent.

Anyway, we, he came dally and we went over the

the building.

up surveillance, a camera, high-power camera across

How about the Albanians now, tell me about the code.

The Albanians, the Albanians we got very friendly with

a Mr.

Koyani, Ambassador to the Mission, the U.N., and

the Albanians are not as elite as the Russians are.

The Russians dry clean their own clothes, burn their

own garbage, have no photos, personal things in the

The Albanians are more, they allow their

children to watch television.

The

Soviets don't.

on the 21st floor of the Newberry.

they had about 30, 30 families who resided there and

their mission was

there.

And we became very friendly

with them because of one incident, especially my

husband, took, went to see his mother and left me in

charge of the

building.

That same day they had a so-

called demonstration where the demonstrators had a

25-minute picketing right to picket.

The demonstra-

tion turned into a bloody riot where they burned flags

and everything and the Albanians came down.

They all

are armed.

They're all armed,

and they agitated the

rioters out on the street.

And I was alone with only

my basic police training and my wits, really, and a

panicking

doorman and my kids.

I was just alone.

I,

the first thing I looked out the window when I heard

the shooting I called the Bureau and I said, "Get me

Al Chestone

fast."

I said I don't have Louis here.

I said I need help. I have a demonstration.

I don't

know what to do.

And there were about 500 people

throwing bricks, urnines, everything through the plate

glass windows.

American flags and Albanian

Élags because of something that happened in Albania.

Those that defected here started this demonstration.

So then I, things got out of hand, the doorman was

hurt with

a brick.

I saw blood, and the Albanian

Ambassador and five top officials agitated these

people from inside the lobby with fists.

Very

unprofessional-like.

Yeah.

So I physically pulled them by their coats and told

them,

"Get upstairs, get upstairs and get yourself

back into the mission'

, because

tenants were walking

hrough the lobby and we were going to get hurt by

Flying glass and everything else.

And I had no help.

The police were outside of the line...

Marita,

what we're going into details is something

that is

story.

Oh, alright.

So we'll go ahead and just bypass that.

Anyway, the Albanians Al was interested into, and

especially because they were admitting the Red Chinese

into the United Nations, which they did.

It was that

speech, which I have the original copy of.

agent

Al Chestone told me convince them, you know,

what

time they throw their garbage out.

Garbage was

the most valuable source of information for the

Bureau, and that was...

Garbage and trash.

Trash. Chicken bones,

codes, diapers, whatever, you

know, and that was my job because I had the patience.

Now the FBI supplied

me with bandaids and gloves,

flashlights, batteries and the whole thing, because

I convinced

the Albanians that the compacter, which

was the disposal system in the building from

31 floors

down -- in other words when they threw their garbage

out that it would come out in brick form, block form,

brick crushed, which in fact was not true.

But they believed it?

They believed it.

They trusted us. Louis and I were

the only ones

allowed in the mission. We were. the

only ones.

Now this mission is that building you were talking

about.

That's still there.

Still there.

Very much there. That's the code that you have.

Right.

So, I started, made it a every two hour routine to go

after midnight when they put their garbage out in the

hall, pick up the bags:

Take them down to the service

turn this garbage letter, in other words, I would

past it together and give it to the Bureau and some

of these letters turned out to be very valuable. Among

them was

one code, now...

And this was turned over to who?

To Al Chestone. The first code I got, I just got on

a hunch lucky.

Because it was just at

the time when

the Red Chinese entered the United States, first

came here.

So I went

downstairs and I waited and sure enough

around 3:30 these bags started to come down from the

21st floor.

3:30 in the morning?

3:30 in the morning because Al said watch them

closely, because of the Red Chinese. And I shut

the machine off and I got these, I got this code,

I caught it in other words, but it....

This is the code you turned over to me?

This is the first code, the very first code,

at the

risk of having my hands chopped off because if I

didn't shut that machine off in time I could have

We were just one mother to another mother.

Their little girl in trouble, mine not in trouble and

it was little things like that that I would get very

involved with. I don't know...

Morita let me ask you this here, did the agents ever

tell you to go out with any of the diplomats in the

mission?

Well, now we have to go back to Oleg, Oleg Likichev.

And who is he again?

He was the KGB spy that they lost and thought he, they

thought he was still residing in Washington, the

side of Washington, D. C., in Virginia.

and all of a sudden they picked him up

in our building,

Well, Oleg, Oleg, let's just say, I don't know if it

was a game they were

or what.

They talked laying or if they were doubles

a lot about the State of

Washington, residing in the State of Washington.

They also knew I had diamonds and he asked me,

(unintelligible) "Can you get me diamonds?"

What did he call you?

Ilonka Marischa, Ilona Marita.

Oh, that's in Russian?

Yes. And we always exchanged Russian words and I

know a few, enough to get by

on.

All of a sudden,

you know, he was interested in diamonds.

He had a

fascination for diamonds. His wife, she was kind

of sweet on my husband he was kind of sweet on me

and I kept telling Uncle Al this thing is going to

get out of hand.

So I said Oleg, what do you

He said uncut stones for cash.

I am a Soviet official, I cannot go into a jewelry

store like you and buy them. I want diamonds.

I said,

"Money, why does anybody want diamonds."

I said tell me why, Oleg. And he s said it's

a good

enough reason.

can we

said we'll figure something out.

And then Oleg said,

this was at a dinner party up in their house.

Hot

diamonds, he wanted hot, uncut, raw diamonds. So

he was serious, he was dead serious. He said he

would buy them for cash.

How serious was he? Did you ever get any for him?

Well it got this far. We told Uncle Al the next

morning.

I said,

"Uncle Al, I got a surprise for

You're gonna have to come up with some hot

diamonds:

A hundred thousand dollars worth because

I promised Oleg that I would get them for him since

he can't buy them.

Oleg wants diamonds." And I

said if you can put two

guy will defect because he's talking about the State

of Washington.

I said but you have to be careful,

I have to be careful, no? So Al said I'll get you

the diamonds. You tell him to get the cash ready.

So Uncle Al went to an underworld source and got

the diamonds.

Uncle Al made a boo-boo and Oleg, the

day of the exchange I was supposed to make the sale

in the apartment, Oleg was at a sports meeting in

Washington, D.C.

Uncle Al said,

"Oh is he?"

I said, "Yes

Right.

Anyway, Uncle Ai started to panick

So what happened?

Al said he had to give them back to

the underworlds

to his source.

so he took ther

back and then Oleg, you know, I had to talk my

way out of it.

It was just one of the flubs.

But

anyway after I left my husband Oleg kept asking for

me, kept coming directly to the apartment and

say-

ing, "Louis, I don't believe you two split, you two

go, she left.

I don't believe it."

And my husband

said "yes, she did leave;

It's her own problems,

Oleg, you know, forget about it."

And he said,

"No, it's not possible.

You must stay together.

You must stay together."

Anyway, he kept coming,

wants to see you.

Where is she living? My

husband tells him I'm living on

88th Street.

Now

I talked to my husband and I said what did you do

that for? Tell him I'm living on 88th Street?

You know, because I know he wants to go out with

me.

You can feel it,

I can feel it, the, you know?

So 1 call up,Uncle Al meantime is transferred to

Newark, I get another case agent. Louis gets a

case agent for the building and he works alone,

without me. The other agent is John Kotter.

With the FBI?

FBI, 69th Street. I call up

John Kotter.

I said,

"John, I hear your taking Al's place", and I meet

him.

Drop things, start things, drop things,

different assignments, then we get to Oleg.

look, Oleg is bothering Louis. He wants to go out

with me.

And John Kotter says, "Beautiful, that is

a beautiful setup. Let's call

him up."

I said,

"Hey, wait a minute:

Either do this sophisticated,

alright?

First I'll send him a Christmas card and

sign it Ilonka Marischa, you know?

I'll put my

phone number on the bottom, something you know?

I said you don't

just call him up.

You know that's going to be like

SO;

saying,

"I got Ilonka's Christmas card.

Marita Lorenze

You an American citizen?

Yes.

Were you born here?

Born in Braemen, Germany on August 18, 1939 and my

mother registered me at birthwith the Consulate

because she was stuck in the war over there, but I

am an American

citizen, not naturalized or

anything.

I was registered as an American citizen.

How old were you when you came to the United States?

I was about 12, came over on the U.S.S. Henry Gibbons,

American troop

transport, because my mother worked for

the United States Army.

Okay, now we're going to go ahead and jump.

You went

to Cuba what month and what year and on what ship.

I met, I went, I took several trips with my father

who was Commander of the oceanliner Berlin. I met

Fidel...

What was your father's full name?

Commander Heinrich Frederick Lorenz.

And how old was he?

Approximately 50-something, 55, when I first, I went

on several trips to Cuba before I met Fidel with,

but I was a little girl.

When's the first time you went to Cuba after Fidel

took over the government on January 1, 1959?

I met Fidel February 28, 1959, on one of my father's

cruises where Fidel came

aboard with several of his

men. He said he saw the oceanliner from the Havana

Hilton balcony and he took a launch with his Chief

of the Navy, what's his name, I forgot, Castagna...

Forget it, forget about it, we can go ahead. Who

else was

there besides the

chief of the Cuban navy.

Selia Sanchez, Haiti Santa Maria, Paco

and Fidel and several of his armed guards.

Okay now, what happened

Castanyava..•

Castanyava

Castanyava was the chief of the Navy.

And Fidel offered you a job or something, can you

go into that?

Well he was very fond of everything German. He

said he read

and my father, you know, tried.

to pacify the tourists,

the passengers on the ship

because they were terrified. They thought they were

being invaded.

So I helped my father pacify the

tourists and it was really a funny scene.

Then I

steered Fidel to my father's cabin and we went to

dinner and Fidel started to play kneesies under the

table. And this was February 28, 1959 on the cruise.

And he offered you a job, right?

Yes, after about 5 hours on board ship we went back

up to my father's cabin and had drinks and exchanged

gifts; and my father and Fidel seemed to get along

very well.. My father is diplomatic and they

exchanged plaques and my father's silver ashtray and

stuff like that.

And he asked me, he asked my father

if since I was bilingual if I could go, come back,

return to cuba to be his secretary since he was

getting German mail and he did not speak German and

he assured me that I would be safe and set up in an

office,

and blah, blah, blah, blah.. And I had

friends in Cuba

anyway.

How old were you then?

Nineteen, nineteen years old:

Did you get off the ship and stay there?

No, I went back to New York. Fidel, on the bridge,

asked me for my phone number and address in New York

and said he would call me, and I just, I didn't

believe it.

When did he call you?

The same day I

arrived in New York. Because my

father took off that night for Germany again and

morning.

Well he went back to Germany with the ship, right?

Where did

you go?

I was living with my brother in New York City.

My brother was a translator for the United Nations

and I was alone living in New York City going to

the Merchantson Banker School.

Well how did you get back to New York City from

Havana?

On my father's ship. It was the last stop on the

cruise of about 5 or 6 stops.

Oh, in other words the, in other words the ship left

that night, left Havana that night...

Yeah.

went over to New York and then from New York went

back

to Europe, right?

Yes. Yes. I thought about Fidel and he pointed out

this is my Havana and I guess I was impressed.

was young, I don't know. And I thought that...

He called, he called you, he knew just about what

time you were going to arrive in New York and when

you got there he called you, what, the same, the same

day you got there?

The same day our ship arrived, three days later. And I

just picked up the phone and the Havana operator said

one moment pleasel heard some shouting and then i

the Prime Minister is on the phone,

on the line,

heard "hello"

Did he speak Cuban or English to you?

He spoke broken English in his hoarse voice. I guess

he was giving a lot of speeches at that time. And he

asked me, "Hello Marita, you think I don't call? I

think about you very much and I call.

I keep my

word.

I want to prove to you that one man's Cuban word I keep."

So,

I was as surprised, I was very surprised.

How long was it did you leave New York to go to

Havana?

Fidel said to me, I said is this really you Fidel,

and he said yes.

I am in Havana Hilton, you call

me back in room ?408, and I said no, alright I

believe you I said because how else would you have

my number.

He said "I want you come back.'

I think

about you and I will send a plane, my plane, and you

come back."

And it was a joke really, I liked the

Cocoa Glace, it's an ice cream in a cocoanut shell,

and he had sent to my father's ship a case of it so

I would have enough for the return trip home because,

I don't know, I just talked about havana,

the island

in general.

So I, and I still didn't believe him

that he would send the plane.

Did he send the airplane?

Yes.

What kind of an airplane did he send?

A. Cubana airliner with...

Four engines?

Yes, with two men and two men came to the, my door.

I was living at 344 West 87th Street at the time, on

the second floor, and my brother was at a UN party

and I was home alone studying.

Oh no, in fact I was

reading a Herbert L. Mathews article on Fidel Castro

and Cuba when the doorbell rang, and it was Jesus

and

• Pedro

and they showed me identification: One came in military

one didn't.

the one said, c"Are you ready?" And one sa

One said,

And one said,

"We go

now. Fidel want very much to see you.

(Laughter).

And I said I didn't finish my homework yet. I was like

in shock.

I didn't know what to do.

So they said they

were staying in a hotel, that they would, the plane

would leave tomorrow, please be ready. I, meanwhile I

haven't even unpacked, you know, from the cruise. My

Mond. other even un

clothes were all laundered anyway from the ship and

I hadn't even unpacked because I was worred about

missing two days at school.

FS :

So

I went...

ES:

Well these

are incidentals anyway, so, what'd you

do, you went to the airport?

time named something else. Idlewild, right?

guards.

So anyway, I met Fidel and that's when I got involved.

FS :

This is more or less a background so they know her

background.

(Unidentified voice: "Yeah, right.")

I mean don't drag it out so much because the details

I was in the...

At the Hilton?

I was driven by black limousine right to the Hilton.

And that's where Fidel was staying at the Hilton, right?

Yes, he was having an argument in his suite with Chez

Raoul and some Americans.

He was having some argument with some Americans. Do

you know who the Americans were?

Yes.

Who were they?

One lady attorney trying to promote something, Muriel...

Oh this was more business or something like that?

Yes business.

Everybody was trying to promote this

and that with Fidel.

Yes, well that's immaterial.

So then I was told to go in the room and wait and the

door locked.

And I was in there, in his suite, anc

Fidel came in and I missed him and he missed me anc

the rest is going to be in the book if I ever write it.

You'll write it don't worry. Alright now..:

If I live.

Do you know approximately when you met me?

after that...

In the coffee shop.

In the coffee shop and this is when you were recruited

to go ahead and spy for the United States and so forth

and, were you ever introduced or, to Colonel Nickels?

Yes.

Do you know who Colonel Nickels is, right.

He was

he Colonel who was military attache with the Americar

Embassy in Havana, Cuba at that time, right?

Yes.

Then you started your spy thing and so forth

and so forth, alright?

Um hum.

We'll go ahead and jump a little bit and so forth.

There were several meetings that Fidel had in the

Hilton with some of the people of the staff. I was

present at the meeting, right?

Right.

And, one of the time that Fidel was talking to the

And it was stated that he was going to run all the

racketeers

out of.

Out of Cuba.

Cuba.

All the American businesses were going to go

ahead and be nationalized because it was Cuba and the

Cuba

• for the Cubans.

Right.

And then it was suggested about well

you know the American government may not like it.

You're gonna have all the American business interests

put pressure on the State Department which would put

pressure on him and that they would be up in arms and

they would have the agents, they would send new agents

into Cuba because the CIA at that time was very close,

closely contacted, at least certain people in the CIA

had contact with

the 26th of July movement.

As a

matter of fact that they were exchanging information

with Castro...

Uh hum.

which enabled him to outwit many of the other groups

so really CIA helped Fidel quite a bit in this power

struggle that was going on in Cuba at that time. So

Fidel, with the help of CIA...

Yes.

got to be the ruler of Cuba. Now...

I would, what about, where did Fidel get most of his

guns from?

Well, you know...

To lead the revolution?

Right, you know, so forth.

That's a story which we

won't have to go into and so forth because we just

unintelligible briefly over it.

And then there

came a period of time where Fidel in all his

popularity and so forth was, now Fidel with you - he

nade approaches to you, right, and so forth?

And in the process of being close with him, being as

force his

attentions

on you and naturally he seduced

you.

You didn't want to but it happened.

Yes.

And you had nobody to go to because, hey, you're in

his

Cuba, right?

I was in his Cuba alright.

Right, now also what we were getting in this Senate

Intelligence Committee has got is the things that

ldel has stated against the United States governmen

I they tried to interfere with the revolution and s

forth when the new election time comes because at that

time the President of the United States was Eisenhower

and it looked like that the Democrats were going to

win the election and he felt that if a new government,

which was discussed among the top military people, if

the new government came in and if they decided that they

didn't like Fidel's policy, which Fidel was saying what

he was going to do for Cuba on an international scale,

that if the United States government decided to go and

turn

against him and put pressure on him he would do

likewise to the United States government. And he was

going to export his revolution in Latin America.

These

are the things that you heard...

So I said,

can we do for oleg about his diamonds? and LouisE

And then Oleg said,

this was at a dinner party up in their house.

Hot

diamonds, he wanted hot, uncut, raw diamonds. So

he was serious, he was dead serious. He said he

would buy them

for cash.

How serious was he? Did you ever get any for him?

Well it got this far.

We told Uncle Al the next

morning.

I said, "Uncle Al, I got a surprise for

you.

You're gonna have to come up with some hot

diamonds.

A hundred thousand dollars worth because

I promised Oleg that I would get them for him since

he can't buy them.

Oleg wants diamonds.

Oleg was at a sports meeting 1n

Dear Mr. Chairman:

We have received a letter from the Honorable George Bush,

Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, relative to the destruc

tion of papers and material which he has held for sometime relative

to our request. Our action was taken to facilitate the inquiry being

undertaken by your predecessor committee under the chairmanship of

Senator Frank Church.

In view of the fact, as we assume, that all of Senator

Church's committee records have been turned over to your permanent

Select Cormittee, we would appreciate your advising us as to whether

or not you want our original letter to stand and the papers and other

materialo to st111 be held. Could you give us the judgment of you

and your Conmittee on this matter?

With best wishes, we are

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20505

2 June 1976

Honorable Mike Mansfield

United States Senate

Office of the Majority Leader

Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Senator Mansfield:

On 27 January 1975, following adoption of S. Res. 21 creating the

Select Committee on Intelligence, you and Senator Hugh Scott requested

that the Central Intelligence Agency "not destroy, remove from [its] pos

session or control, or otherwise dispose or permit the disposal of any

records or documents which might have a bearing on the subjects under

investigation, including but not limited to all records or documents per-

taining in any way to the matters set out in section 2 of S. Res. 21."

In response to this request, the Agency placed in effect a complete

moratorium on the destruction of records, including normal administrative

records scheduled for routine destruction.

The purpose of this letter is to advise you that it is our intention to

proceed with destruction of records, now that the Select Committee has

completed its investigation and issued its final report. We have so advised

Senator Church.

Along with the backlog of routine administrative records, the Agency

will destroy records which were collected and maintained by the Agency

and which were subject to investigation by the Rockefeller Commission

and the Select Committee. The Agency is required to destroy much of

this latter material by the Privacy Act of 1974 (P. L. 93-579) and by

Executive Order 11905. Of course, all records destruction will be fully

consistent with other applicable laws, Presidential directives, and the

requirements of pending litigation and Justice Department investigations.

I trust you agree that this action is now necessary and appropriate,

and I would appreciate your confirmation of this understanding.

I am sending a duplicate of this letter to Senator Hugh Scott.

Sincerely,

Geogge Bush

Washington, b.C.

Dear Senator Mansfield:

lou may recall that some weeks ago you were kind enough to arrange a

meeting between myself and Mr. William Miller, of the staff

of the Senate Select

Committee on Intelligence.

Tou arranged this meeting for me so that I could

present documents, which I showed you, relating to possible CIA illegal activ-

ities in Indochina. Specifically, as

you know, I have long been interested in

the problem of who carried out the nassive defoliation raids against Cambodia,

one year prior to the lo. incursions into that country and during a time when,

formally, there were normal relations between the United States and the Royal

government of Cambodia. After talking with you about the matter, I met, for

about one-half hour, with fir. Hiller and showed him the documents I showed you.

He made some notes and assured me that the question of possible illegal activ-

ities of the CIA in Indochina, including Cambodia, was on the agenda of his

committee. Sometime ago, I wrote ir. Miller to find out when he expected the

committee might look into Indochina. However, as has been the case since

ugust, with respect to communications from this comnittee, I have as yet re-

ceived no answer, not even an acknowleugement of receipt.

I have just read

in the press that the Senate Intelligence Committee expects again to look at

Chile, Cuba, etc., but there is no indication of any interest in Inaochina.

I would creatly appreciate your help in learning whether, in fact, the senate

Select Committee on Intelligence will look into possible illegal coltert opera-

tions of "... intelligence agencies in l!idochina.

your views as to what I should do to get an investigation of the massive clan-

destine herbicide attack on Cambodia (1969). This was a unique operation in

technological history of foreign relations and as a biologist I an most inter-

ested and concerned to get the full story on this bizarre incident.

If the

Senate delect Committee will not ask obvivus questions of the intelligence

community, I would greatly appreciate your views on whomI should turn to, to

ask these

questions.

I want to thank you again for your hel; on my last trip to washington. I

regret that I have to keep bothering you about this matter, but I do hope you

understand my concern, based on my personal observations in Indochina, that

the t'acts about covert operations there be publically determinea.

Dear Mr. Miller:

Recently I discussed with Dr: E. W. Pfeiffer, University of Montana

zoologist, an incident in which he has had an abiding concern:

herbicide attack that occurred in eastern Cambodia in the spring of

1969.

As I understand it, from my talks with Dr. Pfeiffer and from my

review of the correspondence he has received from various agencies,

there is no doubt that the attack actually occurred, that it was

large and sirnificant, and that the nature of the chemicals and

aircraft involved indicate that the U.S. hadi a direct role in

carrying it out.

Yet it seems the state and Defense departments, the CIA and the

"private" CIA-affiliate Air America have all denied

In one way or

another that they conducted the attack.

The obvious question is who did make the attack? Who ordered 1t,

why was it ordered and under what authority? Dr. Pfeiffer has

Indicated your committee is looking into this matter and that the

affair may ultimately be discussed in the course of Select Committee

hearings at some point.

Is it possible for you to

tell me the status of your inquiry? Would

It be ampropriate at this

time for our newspaper to interview Dr.

Pfeiffer and write a news -tory on the documents he has received,

or would such a study benefit from new information your committee

efforts may resurrect within the near future?

Thanks

in advance for your

interest.

We have followed with great

Interest the Select Committee efforts to date.

Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Miller:

Through the good offices of Senator Mansileld, we met some

weeks ago to discuss certain problems related to possibleciA

activity in Cambodia. As you know,I am particularly interested

in why the CIA cannot or will not find out who carried out the

massive herbicide attack against Cambodia in the spring of 1969.

The CIA has under the Freedom of Information Act provided me

with some documents from my file which bear directly upon this

strange episode and Senator Church's efforts to find out information

for me. When we met you indicated that CIA activities in Indochina

were to be investigated by the Select Committee. I would greatly

appreciate krowing about when you think this subject will come

up. I would also very much like to submit some of the documents

I have received from the CIA and my persohal testimony to the

Committee. I believe that Professor A. Westing and myself were

the last official guests of the Sihanouk regime before it was

temporarily deposed.

I look forward to hearing from you on these matters.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Mr. Wallach:

As decided in our phone conversation today, I am

writing to you about a conversation I had last week in

Paris with an official of the Royal Government of Cambodia.

He informed me that CIA-directed activities hostile to his

government are presently occurring in his country, and that

these activities are being launched from bases in Thailand.

I would greatly appreciate your assistance in finding out for

me whether any agency of the U.S. Government is presently

carrying out activities against the Royal Government of

Cambodia.

I greatly appreciated the opportunity to talk with

you in person recently, and thank you for your interest

and help.

Memorandum

mM 2/14/74

To: Terry Lenzner

From: Jim Moore

Subject: Robert Maheu - John Roselli -

Hereis a summary. of what I have done on the Roselli-Maheu

HW

50955

connection®

Yesterday I spoke with David Nissen, who prosecuted Roselli in

1968 for being an unregistered alien and for being involved with hidden

owners in the Friar's Clubi case. Nissen never met Maheu or spoke with

him.

However,

he did remember that stories about Maheu and Roselli

being involved in anti-Castro plots did come to his attention when he was

investigating and prosecuting Roselli. He couldn't remember the source

of those stories, saying that his information came from many people,

including Justice Department lawyers in Washington and the FBI. One

story he heard was that Maheu tried to intervene in Washington, either

through direct contacts in the FBI or at Justice or through Edward P.

Morgan, to kill the Roselli prosecution on the basis that Roselli had helped

the United States in Cuba. Maheu was reportedly an old CIA agent, • Nissen

remembers hearing at some point that Roselli had gone to Cuba in an attempt

to assasinate Castro.

Nissen said that there are extensive files on Roselli maintained by

the FBI or the Department. Niesen had a vague recollection that the files

contained a story about Maheu somehow being involved in a wiretap on Sam

Giancona, for whom Roselli worked. Nissen also remembered information

about a meeting between Maheu and Giancona regarding. Cuba, but he couldn't

remember any of the specifics.

itines

DocId: 32423630 Page 317

## Page 315

When Roselli came up for sentencing, he was represented by Tom

Wadden, who had been associated in some capacity with Edward Bennett

Williams. Wadden filed a motion to reduce sentence and included with it

two columns by Jack Anderson that recounted the story of Roselli and Maheu

trying to assasinate Castro. Nissen thought the motion might also have

included an affidavit from Edward P. Morgan.

The government successfully

resisted the motion on the grounds of fraud, since Wadden produced no

witnesses or documentation to support his claim..

I called the Federal Court

in Los Angeles, and they have sent the motion for reduction of sentence? and

attached papers to us. The Clerk there told me that in addition to the Anderson

columns, the motion included affidavits from Anderson and Les Whitten

vouching for the unnamed source of the columns.

Roselli is now in Florida so he can be reached, but, according to:

Nissen, Giancona is in exile somewhere in Mexico.

FRONTIER CASE

Nissen never heard about Maheu being questioned in Washington in

Frontier

lieu of the Grand Jury appearance. Nissen did not try the/case, because he

had been promoted to supervisory capacity. However, he seemed surprised

that he had never heard of such a meeting. He. gave me the names of

three lawyers who handled the case after he gave up direct responsibility.

for it.My phone interview with the first of them, Jerry Ullman, is written

up as a separate interview. The second Lawyer, John Hornbeck, has not

yet returned my phone call. The third, Tom Kotoski,actually tried the case.

He is now an assistant United States Attorney in Los Angeles and about to

become head of the San Francisco Strike Force. He will be in Washington

Thursday and Friday, February 14 and 15, and I have asked him to call me

as soon as possible.

that

One final note - Nissen said/the Roseli/in the Justice Department

contains many references to Maheu. He never, however, saw or heard about

a file kept on Maheu himself.

Richard Crane, head of the Organized Crime office in Los Angeles,

is also in town until the end of this week. He may know something about

Maheu and Roselli,

asi

well as about? Dalitz coming back to the

Desert Inn. He should call me this evening or tomorrow morning.

:?Also.

Mike DeFeo,head of the Kansas City Strike Force, will be in town tomorrow

and Friday. He, according to Crane, might know something about the Dunes.

In addition,

Will Wilson mentioned the strike fouce man from Kansas City

as the one who set up the Maheu interview at the Justice Department.

I

spoke with DeFeo today, and he will call me tomorrow to arrange a meeting

time before he leaves town.

MEMORANDUM

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL

to:

Senator Ervin

From:

Terry Lenzner and Marc Lackritz

Subject: Relevance to S. Res. 60 of John Rosselli's :

testimony about his CIA activities

'2..

Summary:

John Rosselli and his attorney, Tom Wadden, object to

testifying about Rosselli's involvement with Robert Maheu in a ::

CIA-financed plot to assassinate Fidel Castro in the early 1960's :

The objection is based upon national security grounds as well as

an assertion by Mr. Wadden that the material is not relevant to

our inquiry under S. Res. 60.

Testimony of Mr. Rosselli about this matter is relevant

and necessary to our investigation for a variety of reasons.

Facts: -

..÷::'

end al Wood darter

During the last year of the Eisenhower Administration, the

CIA apparently financed and organized a plot to assassinate Fidel

Castro. "Among the participants in this plot were Robert Maheu and

John Rosselli. Maheu had a public relations business at the time..

and Rosselli was associated with some alleged organized crime

figures (e.g. Sam Giancana) who had lost substantial gambling

Investments when Castro came to power. Apparently, the plot

continued into the early 1960's even after the abortive Bay of Pigs

invasion, but it failed in attaining its objective of killing Castro.

Only a few officials in the government knew of the exis-

tence of the plot at that time.

Justice Department officials stumbled across this infor-

mation about the plot as a result of their investigation into an

illegal wiretap by Sam Glancana in the early 1960's.

The sensitive information was brought to the attention of

FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, and either he or then-Attorney General

Robert Kennedy ordered the prosecution of Giancana dropped in order

not tò compromise national security considerations.

...÷

1 815.

The Information about the alleged assassination plot then

lay dormant in a secret file in the Department of Justice until

early

1969, when Assistant Attorney General Will Wilson requested the

file from the Deputy Chief of the Organized Crime Section. The file

was returned to Central Files shortly after it was taken out.

→ AsSistant Attorney General Wilson next requested the sécret

Justice file in early 1971 in connection with his interview of Robert

Maheu on January 27, 1971 (see attached chronology). This interview

at the Department of Justice, in lieu of a grand jury appearance, was

arranged by a telephone call to Attorney Ceneral Mitchell on January 19,

1971, only one day after Jack Anderson published his first column linking

both Maheu and Rosselli to the CIA plot to kill Castro. (see attached)

7 41

However, the significance of Anderson's column on January 18,

1971, was that on the same day. Haldeman requested Dean to find out

what he could about the Hughes - Maheu - O'Brien relationship.

In the follow-up memos from Caulfield to Dean on the Maheu-

O'Brien link, Caulfield notes Maheu's prior "covert activities" for the

CIA and advises Dean that a check into CIA, FBI, and IRS files on Robert

Maheu is advisable to avoid a "counter-scandal."

In addition, Assistant Attorney General Wilson showed the

sensitive "Castro file" to Attorney General Mitchell, in January, 1971,

and discussed with him the political implications of the information.

Following the on-the-record interview of Maheu on January 27, 1971,

by Lynch, Wilson and Petersen, Maheu was interviewed privately by

Wilson concerning his prior CIA activities with John Rosselli. Maheu

was not forthcoming with information about the plot at that time.

Attorney General Mitchell discussed the contents of the sensitive file

with President Nixon, according to Wilson, who had advised him to do

SO.

Conclusion:

Therefore, the obsession of the Administration in keeping tabs

on Larry O'Brien in 1971 and 1972 was in part motivated by a "fear that

Maheu would impart some of this sensitive information about the plot

to O'Brien. Alternatively the objective was to discover if there was

any information about the plot that might be damaging to the Democrats

that O'Brien might possess from Maheu. And these concerns could

have been a possible motivation for the break-in to the offices of the

DNC and Larry O'Brien by four Cuban-Americans on June 17, 1972.

especially since their directions were to photograph any documents

relating to Cuban contributions or Cuban involvement in the 1972*•

Democratic campaign.

It is for these reasons that we wish to question John Rossell For:

about the nature and scope of his activities. with Robert Maheu in the

early 1960's.

MEMORANDUM

John Rosselli is actually Filippo Sacco, born July 4, 1905,

in Italy of parents Vincenzo and Maria Sacco. Vincenzo Sacco

came to the United States after the birth of Filippo, his oldest

child, and in 1911, Mrs. Sacco and Filippo joined Vincenzo in

the United States where they resided as aliens in East Boston.

Filippo Sacco completed the sixth grade in the public

schools of East Boston and was discharged from school in 1917.

By this time Filippo had two younger brothers and two younger

sisters. In 1918, Vincenzo Sacco died. His wife Maria and the

five children moved into the residence of Liberato Clanciulli

and a daughter was born in 1920. In 1922, Maria and Clanciullf

were married.

In 1922, Filippo had a job driving a horse-drawn milk

wagon and was nicknamed "Milky". However, in addition to his

legitimate occupation, Filippo had made connections with the

criminal element in East Boston and was engaged innarcotic

traffic with his headquarters in and around Maverick Square.

On September 14, 1922, Filippo sold morphine to a government

informant named Fisher while under surveillance by a narcotic

agent. On September 19, 1922, Filippo arranged for a large

sale fron his "source" and was present and under agent sur-

veillance when the morphine was delivered. On September 29,

1922, Filippo Sacco and his "source" were arrested by Federal

narcotics agents. On October 18, 1922, the Federal Grand Jury

in Boston indicted Sacco for the sale of narcotic drugs and

two days later he was released on bail. While awaiting trial

in the narcotics case, in Federal Court, Sacco was arrested and

indicted in Massachusetts State Court for grand larceny and

was released on bail on July 2, 1923.

In 1923, while he was on bail awaiting trial in the

narcotics and larceny cases, Filippo Sacco jumped bail in both

cases and disappeared from East Boston. The Government narcotics

informant, Fisher, disappeared about the same time and Goverment

sources believe that he may have been killed to

prevent him from

testifying

Because of his fugitive status, both indictments

against Sacco were dropped.

After Sacco's flight from his home in 1923, he spent some

time in New York and Chicago, and finally made his appearance in

Los Angeles in 1924 under the fictitious name "John Roselli."

Sources indicate that Sacco engaged in bootlegging and hijacking

during this period and police records show he was frequently

arrested on such charges as carrying concealed weapons, and sus

picion of robbery.

After 1930, Sacco became associated with the Al Capone

gang in Chicago and was also closely associated with organized

crime in Los Angeles. Reliable sources relate that he was an

executioner for the criminal organizations in both cities. In

1936, by demands and threats, Sacco forced his way into part

ownership of "Nationwide News Service," a horseracing information

service used by bookmakers across the country.

• After prohibition was repealed, Sacço left the bootlegging

business and associated himself with Columbia Picture Studios.

As a close friend of Los Angeles underworld leader Jack Dragna,

Sacco soon became known as a labor muscleman and racketeer for

the movie studios. In 1943, Sacco was Indicted on a charge of

conspiracy to extort millions of dollars from movie producers

and a labor union. Also indicted were union officials Browne

and Bloff, and the following ranking members of the Chicago La

Cosa Nostra family: Frank Nitto (aka Nitti), Louis Campagna,

Paul DeLucia (aka Paul "the waiter" Ricia), Phil D'Andrea,

Francis Manitote (aka Frank Diamond), and Charles "Cherry Nose"

Gioe. In 1944, Sacco and the Chicago defendants were convicted

and all were sentenced to ten years in prison.

In 1947, Sacco and all his co-defendants were paroled

immediately upon their becoming eligible therefor.

There were

indications that their release had been secured by bribery but

admissible evidence sufficient for prosecution was not obtained.

In July 1948, Sacco's parole was revoked because of his con-

tinued association with known criminals and he was imprisoned

until November 1948, when his parole was reinstated. Shortly

after Sacco's parole terminated in March 1954, William Bioff, a

key Government witness at the extortion trial was murdered by

the bombing of his vehicle. (The trial judge reportedly had

warned the defendants that if anything happened to Bioff while

they were on parole he would hold them responsible.) Two other

co-defendants of Sacco have also been victims of gang slayings.

Upon his release from prison, Sacco returned to Los Angeles

and again associated himself with a movie studio. Reliable

sources report that this was a front and in fact, through his

close association with San Giancana of Chicago, Sacco received

the responsibility of overseeing the concealed interests in

Las Vegas casinos of the Chicago underworld.

Sacco immediately

became a powerful figure in Las Vegas. He travels back and

forth between Las Vegas and Los Angeles extensively and asso-

ciates with the known Cosa Nostra members and major gamblers.

Rosselli appeared before the Kefauver Committee investi-

gating organized crime and falsely testified concerning his

association with underworld figures and even his own personal

background.

During the period 1956-1958, Sacco was very active in

the construction and pre-opening operation of the Tropicana Hotel,

and Sacco received the lease to operate the gift shop.

Nevada Gaming Control Board refused to allow the Tropicana to

open as long as Sacco was associated with its operation, where-

upon the hotel owners were forced to buy back the gift shop lease

at a cost of $180,000, reportedly about thitty times the amount

paid for the lease.

During the above period, Sacco also involved himself in the

production of shows for the Tropicana, but again the Gaming

Control Board refused to allow him to participate in any capacity

and he sold his interest.

Following his ouster from the

Tropicana, Sacco sold ice machines to most of the Las Vegas hotels

at prices far in excess of prices on the open market. Sacco has

also received numerous "finders fees" from various Las Vegas

hotels and casinos for which few if any services were performed.

• In October 1960, Sacco and I. W. Richardson were involved

in placing a wire tap on the telephone of comedian Dan Rowan in

Las Vegas at the request of Chicago gangster Sam Giancana.

In May 1968, Sacco was convicted of failing to register as

an alien and report his address annually. In the course of that

trial, it was shown that birth records in Chicago, Illinois, had

been forged in an effort to make it appear that Sacco had been

born there as John Rosselli. Sacco has long been

a close friend

of Edward J. Barrett, County Clerk, Cook County, Illinois,' in

whose office the birth records for Chicago were kept.

Among Sacco's underworld associates are the following:

Al Capone - head of the Chicago underworld gang;

Charles F. Fischetti - a Capone lieutenant;

Micky Cohen - gambler and racketeer;

Jack Dragna - leader of the Cosa Nostra, Los Angeles,

now deceased;

Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel - member of Murder, Inc.,

Numerous prospective witnesses in the course of investiga-

tions concerning Sacco's criminal activities have expressed or

displayed fear at the prospect of being called to testify

against him, and a number of witnesses have refused to testify.

In the Friars Club trial, It was apparent that a number of

witnesses deliberately perjured themselves in order to exonerate

Sacco, Including Friedman, Vinnie Donato, Lee Deer, and Nat Ross.

Defendant Sacco was convicted in the Friars Club case in

December 1968 of interstate travel in aid of a racketeering

enterprise and interstate transportation of fraudulently obtained

securities. He was also convicted of making a false statement in

his income tax return.

Sacco has had a long practice of concealing.

the source and nature of his income. He was sentenced to five years

in prison.

In view of Sacco's extensive criminal record extending back

more than 40 years, as well as his membership and participation

In the organized criminal syndicate known as Cosa Nostra, we

strongly urge that defendant Sacco's sentence not be reduced for

any reason whatsoever.

He is a genuine menace to society and,

In particular, to those witnesses who have testified against him.

Prior to moving to Florida he

Benjamin Teitlebaum, and Manuel Jacobs. (He noted that Hank Greenspun had no Involve-

ment either as a co-defendant or unindicted co-conspirator in that case.)

With regard to Bob Maheu, he net Maheu for the first time in the mid-50's

in either Washington or, California

When questions were asked as to what his subsequent Involvement with Maheu was,

Rosell's attorney instructed him not to

Re

said that he had received a call from Maheu, who needed to make arrangements for

Hughes to move to Las Vegas from Boston.

According to Maheu, no one wanted to give

Fughes any rooms. Roselli at the request of Maheu left his residence in Los Angeles

and went up to Las Vegas and asked his acquaintance Ruby Kolod, who owned 13% of

the Desert Inn, to accommodate Hughes and allow him to take two of the penthouses

at the Desert Inn. At the time Maheu was in charge of security and responsible for

seeing that Fughes arrived unnoticed in Las Vegas.

Kolod acquiesced and told

Rosellf that the top floor of the Desert Inn would be available at the going rate,

but that they would have to leave the hotel by New Years. When the New Years date

was approaching, Maheu called and said that they had received notice from Kolod and

were suppose to leave

their premises.

Rosell then convinced Kolod to allow

them

to stay.

At the same time he told Maheu that Hughes should buy the Hotels

any problems:

Maheu responded that he was

want to get involved in any of the gambling businesses and would not therefore want

to purchase the hotel. It was at this point that Roselll conceived of the idea of

trying to selt the hotel, and approached kolod and asked if he would be willing to

sell it. Kolod replied that if Rosells could make arrangements to sell it he would

receive a finder's fee. Rosell then turned around and-asked Maheu if he wanted to

purchase It.

Maheu responded that he would and Roselll turned the matter over to

his attorney Fd Morgan who then handled the matter until the end. Rosell also

represented his finder's fee for the sale of both the Desert Inn and the Sands:

concerning the las Vegas hotel Industry•

With regard to Ed Morgan, Roselli met him in the middle 50's. Since that

time Morgan has represented him in different Las Vegas Interests. He noted that

Morgan did not represent him in his Friars' Club defense (but did arrange for Jim

Cantillion, a Los Angeles attorney to handle the matter). He said that he had no

trouble with Morgan's handling of the Desert Inn finder'g fee, since he trusted

Morgan implicity. He noted that Morgan had arranged for John

Rosell1 to be represent

by Tom Wadden, his present attorney. This representation first began on the appeal

from the Friar's Club.

Rosell1 indicated that his only present interest in Las Vegas concerns:

his boldings in the gift shop at the Frontier hotel. His involvement there started

in 196T when he had an arrangement with Mr. Friedman. This set-up did not work out

and Rosells resigned as President of the gift shop.

Thereafter he made an arrange.

ment with a Mr. Breen whereby he would furnish Breen with money and indemnify him

against any losses if Breen would run the gift shop.. This arrangement has worked

out fairly well and he continues to receive his share of the profits each year from

the gift shop.

He mentioned that it was his opinion that Breen had been poorly

treated by the Fughes enterprises, since Hughes first purchased the Frontier.

He

recalls, at his last meeting with Maheu, asking Maheu to lend Breen $60,000 for the

gift shop. Maheu said he would get back to him but never did. Ultimately a loan

was arranged through Perry Thomas at: the Valley Bank of Nevada.

÷

Since 1967 Rosell has seen Maheu only once. And while he does not recall

the date of that meeting he remembers that it was in Los Angeles before Maheu had

terminated with Hughes. He recalls that Maheu was in Los Angeles at the time while

his wife was having a foot operation; and that he called Roselli to have supper.

Rosell has no recollection of the conversation that the two had at supper other

than that they discussed, as noted above, the possibility of arranging a loan for

Breen at the Frontier Hotel Gift Shop.

He said he has known Peter Maheu since the middle 1950's and that he went

to Peter's wedding reception. His only Involvement with Peter occurred whenever

Robert Maheu wanted

a message conveyed to Rosell1. He recalls no subsequent substanti

discussions with Peter Maheu.

Los Angeles, he remembers being represented by James Cantillon & Los Angeles attorney

He remembers that this grand jury was convened sometime in the summer of 1970 and

that his appearance took place before he went to jail, which was Jamary 25, 1971.

He has no recollection of lavid Nissen, the prosecutor, ever having made a comment

about Maheu; nor did he question Rosellf about his recollection of his involvement

with Maheu in the Cuban undertaking. Roselli had very bad words about Nissen and

mentioned that Nissen had once filed with Judge Gray an unsigned and undated state-

ment discussing Roselli's background, which Roselll, and Wadden both said was very

inaccurate.

Roseill has no recollection of being asked to be an informer by Nissen.

Hedoes

remember, however,

being approached by two FBI agents in 1966 about the

possibility of being an informer.

This possibility is discussed in the court files.

Rosell recalls appearing four or five times before the Frontier Hotel

He answered questions

appeared at

grand jury the request of Nissen and waited around.

extensively only on the first day and thereafter

Wadden indicated that we should

make a request of Judge

Byrne or whoever

else might have access to those grand jury

minutes to get Roselli's testimony about the Frontier.

Rosell1 does not recall

having talked to Bob Maheu about his appearance before the grand jury. He said he

had no recollection of Maheu appearing there but, after being advised by Wadden

that Maheu's appearance was well noted in the paper, he said he may have read about

He said he has no recollection or knowledge of Bob Maheu ever making an

application on Roselli's behalf for reduction of sentence.

With regard to political contributions, he has never had any discussions

with Rebozo, or had any conversations with anyone about any contributions (of over

$10,000) to a Presidential campaign. He has no recollection of the Teamsters making

any substantial contributions to the Presidential Campaign. Similarly he has no

knowledge of ferry Thomas making any contribution.

Rosselli has no recollection of ever discussing with Maheu any of

Maheu's problems or contacts with the Administration.

Specifically, he does

not recall Maheu ever talking about Stans or any involvements Stans may have

had

with Thomas or Greenspun

He knew nothing about any use of stolen stocks.

With regard to Jim Crosby, Jack Davis and Mary Carter Paoint Co. he

knew nothing.

Similarly he knew nothing about Jim Golden.

He had no knowledge of Bob Peliquin or Intertel's involvement at

Paradise Island.

Wadden chimed in by noting that he had been an old associate

of Fundley and had gone to Paradise Island with Hundley about T years ago to

look at the Paradise Island set-up.

Rosells has never talked with or met Jack Caulfield. Nor does he

recall ever having any private individuals interview him while he was in jail.

He recalls however, that three officers from the Immigration Department once vis-

Ited him'and told him about the detainer that was being held on him.

Similarly,

while he was in

ja1l, the IRS interviewed him in los Angeles about the finder's

fee he received

in the Frontier Hotel.

The Investigation may have related somewhat

to maneu, but, since it was so short, he does not recall what the discussion

about Maheu concerned.

He noted that no one has ever asked him about Danner,

Rebozo or any members

of the Administration.

With regard to Hank Greenspun, Roselll has known him since the 50's.

The last time he met Greenspun was when

he ran into Greenspun in Los Angeles shortly

after he got out of prison, at which time they talked a few minutes.. No questions

were asked and there was no discussion with Greenspun about his involvement with

He noted that Greenspun has never questioned him about any matters.

He noted that he has never met Gordon Liddy, Howard Funt or any of the

Cuban Americans who were involved in the Watergate break-in.

He said however that

he has been Liddy once, and that was at Terminal Island when he was acting as a

prison librarian.

There were no discussions with Liddy. He is fairly certain he

has never met Hunt with regard to any CIA Involvement of his own. He also noted

that he has never had any property or business dealings in Cuba.

The interview concluded with the serving of a subpoena upon Mr. Rosell

and the decision to hold a further meeting under oath at a later date.

On January 18th and 19th, 1971, there appeared in newspapers

throughout the country nationally syndicated articles by columnist

Jack Anderson alleging that defendant had assisted the Central Intelligence

Agency of the United States Government as set forth in said articles.

The affidavits of Jack Anderson and his assistant, Les Whitten, are

as Exhibits A and B. Exhibits A and B were published on the 18th and 19th

of January, 1971. Attached as Exhibit C is a follow-up column which

SS.

LESLIE WHITTEN, being duly sworn, deposes and says the

following:

1. I am employed as principal associate of nationally-

syndicated columnist Jack Anderson, writer of: "Washington Merry-

Go-Round".

2. I worked on certain articles relating to John

Rosselli, and services performed by him on behalf of the Central

Intelligence Agency, an organ of the United States Federal Gov-

ernment.

3. As part of my investigation, I twice called William

K. Harvey, a retired Central Intelligence Agency official, now öf

Indianapolis.

4. On my first call, in January, I asked Harvey if it

were not true that he had personally intervened with the Justice

Department in order to mitigate the government's prosecution of

Rosselli on the basis that Rosselli had done a formidable service

for his country. Harvey said "this is a long story... I don't

think it ought to be printed." I asked him whether it was not

true that he had

a high regard for Rosselli. "I still do," he

earnestly replied.

5. In pursuing the story further, I called Harvey

again in Indianapolis in February and asked him whether he could

comment on our

story

about Rosselli which by now has been

pub-

lished widely in the United States. He declined to comment. But

he twice reaffirmed his "high regard" for Rosselli. I advised

him I was making an affidavit on Rosselli's behalf and he ex-

pressed concern for Rosselli, asked his present status and said

he would "follow up" on Rosselli's behalf from his end.

6. Based on my part of the investigation, I am satis-

fied that the facts set down in Exhibit A, appended to the Affi-

davit of Jack Anderson, are a truthful account of Rosselli's

June 24, 1978 Testimony of John Rosselli before Committee

Senator |Church presiding

Los Angeles

Rosselli first met Maheu in approximately July, 1960,

pursuant

to a telephone call from Maheu.

At their first

meeting, Maheu told Rosselli that a high government official

had requested that Maheu recruit Rosselli to "fight Communism

90 miles away from Florida"' -- to recruit Cubans to

assassinate

Castro.

New York

Rosselli had second meeting with Maheu and went to New York

in September under the alias of John Rawlston

[Castro was

in New York at this timel. Rosselli met Jim O'Connell of

CIA, plus "three others.

Florida

O'Connell, Maheu and Rosselli met in Florida hotel approxi-

mately one week after New York.

Rosselli introduced Giancana

to Maheu. Also introduced X (Trafficante) to Maheu. Obtained

permission from Maheu to bring Giancanainto project.

Rosselli recruits Cuban #1, Rosselli's cover was as Wall Street

businessman.

Rosselli and Maheu agree on a $250,000 price tag

for the job.

O'Connell never met Cubans. Trafficante, Cubans and Maheu met.

Maheu brought $10,000 and poison capsules.

Rosselli told Giancana about CIA involvement to keep his mouth

shut.

Rosselli only had one discussion with Giancana.

O'Connell called Rosselli after Bay of Pigs. Met in Florida

not long after Bay of Pigs with William Harvey, O'Connell and

Rosselli. Harvey told Rosselli that he wanted Rosselli to

have nothing to do with Maheu and not to use Giancana connections.

Rosselli indicates that pro-Castro people in Florida probably

had inkling of assassination attempts.

During Missle Crisis, Harvey asked Rosselli to see if "they"

had any intelligence on us, on the missiles.

FBI agents Hill and Dodge met with Rosselli and his lawyer,

Cantillon.

At this time Dodge informed Rosselli that the

and home

FBI was

aware that he was not a U.S. citizen.

Dodge indicated

something about Nevada and

some other secret organizations.

Rosselli met with Sheffield Edwards in 1966 for some drinks

and discussed his problems with the FBI.

Rosselli received a telephone call from an FBI agent, Jack

Barron in June of 1970.

The agent informed Rosselli

that his

appeals can be reversed. He was told that his lawyers and

friends can't do anything for him in Washington.

Rosselli talked with Bill Harvey prior to his testimony before

the Select Committee to see if Harvey had objections and

Harvey only suggested that Rosselli protect those people whose

lives and whose families might be jeopardized by his testimony.

Rosselli stated he did not know the five so-called Watergate

burglars -- Hunt, McCord, Barker, Martinez or Sturgis.

Roselli had no doubt that the Cuban operation was on behalf

of the CIA and not Mr. Hughes.

Rosselli stated that his Cuban contacts were never informed

that this was a CIA project, but that he represented a Wall

Street business:

In the period 1967-1968, Rosselli failed to register as an

alien and faced criminal charges.

Rosselli describes how he is brought into the operation --

Maheu's contact: and O'Connell's satisfying him that they

were government representatives.

Rosselli stated that Sheffield Edwards was not overly concerned

with the FBI's contacting Rosselli.

Rossell's reason for not informing his sources that it was

a CIA operation was because he believed he would be more

successful doing what he was doing by representing big

business.

When the FBI contacted Rosselli in both 1966 and 1970

they hinted that they wanted Rosselli to provide information

about United States gambling interests.

After the Cuban Missile Crisis, the whole operation came

to a halt and Rosselli said he

was never in contact with

the Cubans again.

Rosselli met Harvey at Dulles Airport in Washington after

the Missile Crisis, in June 1963, and had dinner with him

in Washington that night.

Rosselli mentions FBI had him under surveillance for several

years.

Roselli has two stories re Rowan wiretap from Maheu.

Maheu

told him he wanted Rosselli to get some bail money for two

guys in Las Vegas who were in trouble and he had placed some

taps in Rowan's room because 1) Maheu was doing Giancana a

favor, and 2) Maheu had the authority to see if Giancana was

leaking to his girlfriend.

Rosselli arranged bail money for the two men who were caught

tapping Rowan's room.

Giancana laughed when Rosselli discussed tapping incident with

him, but gave no clues to the reason for the tap.

Rosselli met in New York with O'Connell and Harvey in April

1962.

Rosselli states to the Committee that he felt the CIA came

to him because he has contacts in Cuba.

Rosselli states he took on "project" because it was the

government; he was patriotic.

Rosselli knew Trafficante before "operation" started.

Rosselli maintained some contact with Maheu after Harvey took

over.

Rosselli still is social friends with Harvey.

In April or May of 1966, Rosselli was stopped in the street

by two FBI agents with note saying to meet him later. Rosselli

referred them

to his attorney, Mr. Cantillon

SUBJECT:

ASSASSINATION OF THE PRESIDENT

I had a long talk this morning with Congressman Gerald R. (Gerry) Ford

told me he wanted to talk in the strictest of confidence. This was agreed to.

(Chief Justice Warren was carrying on his Chairmanship of the Presidential Commission.

He explained that the tist inistake that Wurren made was his attempt to establish a

ore man commission"' by appointing a Chiet Counsel, Warrei Olney, that was his own

prolege.

Ford staled that after the mention of Olney's name by the Chief Justice, at

their first meeting, Allen Dulles, former Director of CIA, protested quite violently.

Because of Dulles' protest.

the other members told Warren that they would like to knowI

more about Olney prior to giving their consent.

On the occasion of their second meeting, Ford and Hale boggs joined i

Dulles. Hale Boggs told Warren flatly that Olney would not be acceptable and that

he (Poggs) would not work on the Commission with Olney. Warren put up a stiff

argument jut a compromise was inace when the name of Lee Rankin was mentioned.

Warren sinted he knew Rankin and could work with him.

Ford told me that he was currently having problems inasmuch as the

majority of the members of the Commission desired to go along with the recommendatio

made in Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach's Loiter to the Commission dated 12-9-63-

"In this loller, Katzenbach recommended that the Commission make an immediate

self-defeating ways. Indeed, even as the

Kennedy Administration was taking

these first covert steps toward rap

prochement, the CIA was engaged in an

attempt on Castro's life. If, due to a lack

of political control and a prevailing at-

mosphere of cold-war hostility, U.s

agents could be conducting such activi-

ties in direct conflict with Presidential

policy, it is not difficult to imagine simi-

lar distortions on the Cuban side. Only a

few weeks earlier, Castro had publicly

denounced U.S.-sponsored assassina-

tions and even threatened retaliation.

ficials have taken this for tacit authority

But all this remains speculation. It is

possible to envision any number of sce-

narios that might have led to. the fatal

events of Nov. 22. In lieu of hard evi-

dence, however, it seems only fair to give

Castro the same benefit of the doubt that

Kennedy has been accorded-namely:

that he be considered innocent until

proved guilty. It is hoped that the inves-

tigations to come will proceed on the

basis of that assumption.

PART TWO: JIM. BRADEN

One of the most incredible bodies of recent information

concerning

the alleged conspiracy

to assassinate President

Kennedy is largely based on the investigative research

done by Peter loves, a former CBS Producer and top inves-

tigative reporter.

Last year, Noyes published a book, Legacy of Doubt, which

summed up many of

his findings, and which generally outlines

what Noyes believes

was heavy Mafia involvement in the

assassination. The Noyes book is almost entirely factual

and is largely based on substantiated information such as

Department,

police officials.

Though the Noyes book (like most recent assassination books)

did not sell well or receive much press attention,

it has

regarded

as a valuable contribution by most of author

Noyes' fellow Warren Commission critics.

It can definitely be said that

almost all of lloyes' findings,

particularly with respect to his main character Jim Braden,

have been

factually substantiated and are solidly established

by official police

records.

Basically the Noyes book outlines the background of a

mysterious man who was picked

up by the police at the scene

of President Kennedy's assassination

just minutes after the

shooting. The man was apprehended by a Dallas policeman who

thought he was behaving suspiciously. The man, who identified

himself under the false name of Jim Braden, was released

shortly thercafter following brief questioning by the Dallas

Sheriff's Office.

Author loves uncovered the story of Jim Braden and his

true identity during five years of investigative research.

And it is Jim Braden's true identity and his ironic misfortune

of being picked up at the scene of the assassination for

"looking suspicious" that the warren Commission critios now

believe

ranks with James McCord's mistake of leaving masking

tape on the doors during the Watergate break-in as

the ultimate.

fatal slip-ups in the two conspiracies.

For Jim Braden, whose true identity is Eugene Hale Brading,

is a man with

singularly avesome direct ties to the highest

levels of the kafia. Of all the Mafia figures connected to

the syndicate's crucial security and enforcement activities

of coercion, maiming, intra-syndicate assassination and

outside murder contracting, Jim Braden appears to be an

indispensable link - or leader - of organized crime's

far flung network of "controlled violence" specialists

and professional hit men.

Braden's involvement with the Mafia's highest echelon

"enforcers" has spanned the continent from coast to coast

and covers virtually every national crime syndicate juris

diction. According

to federal authorities working with

Justice Department's organized crime strike force units, and

Meyer Lansky.

The importance of this mysterious man who was picked up

under a false name across

the street from the Texas Book

Depository just moments

after the shots were fired on

November 22, 1963 cannot be overemphasized.

Though there vere several

innocent witnesses or bystanders

in the arca of the assassination who were also arrested or

brought in for questioning by the dallas police, all of whom

were shortly released like Jim Braden, his presence there at

that precise moment does in fact raise an incredible specter,

and may indeed have been

of the warren Commission now attest to

Jin Braden's Arrest On Hovember 22

Deputy C.L. Lewis was one of the first Dallas police

officers on the scene at the

Texas School Book Depository

following the assassination.

wIthin just minutos after the deadly shots were tired,

Donuty Lowis confronted a man across the street fron the

Book Depository, a man whom Lewis thought was

"acting

suspiciously."

Deputy Lovis questioned the man for sevoral minutes before

taking him

to the Sheriff's office for further interrogation.

The man identified himself as Jim Braden, and said that he

was in the oil business in Beverly Hills, California. Deputy

Levis became even more suspicious over the way the man first

tried to identify hinsolf. Instead of producing his driver's

license, the common

means of identification, the man pulled

out a gasoline credit card instead.

The man who identified himself

as Jim Braden strongly protested

when Deputy Lewis told him

that he would have to take him in

for further interrogation.

it the Sheriff's offico, Jim Braden agreed to make a voluntary

statement. Braden, then

48, told the police that he vas in

Dallas on oil business and

had been there for two days. He

he was staying at the Cabana lotel, s short distance away

the scene of the assassination. Braden said he had been

walking down the street by the Texas Book Depository at the

time of the assassination and had been looking for a taxi cab.

Braden further stated that he was confronted by Deputy

Levis inside a building across the street from the Depository

during an attempt to make a telephone call following the

shooting.

Braden was shortly thereafter relcased by tho Dallas Sheriff's

office. Braden was not fingerprinted, nor was any check made

of possible criminal records relating to him.

Two months later, in late January of 1961, Jim Braden was

interviewed by tro

FBI agents at his office in Bevorly Hills.

The Marren Commission's investigation was then in full swing

and witnesses to the assassination were being questioned by

the FBI and other authorities. In his FBI interview, Braden

gave the same

account as he had given

to the Dallas police on

the day of the assassination. The FBI's official report on

Braden's interrogation further stated

"Braden has no

information concerning

assassination and both Lec Harvey

Oswald and Jack Ruby are unknown

to hin."

Jim Braden's Truc Identity Energes

In early 1909, Peter Foves,

the investigative reporter

whose bool covers much of

the information regarding

Jim

Braden, Dogan investigating the mysterious california

"oil man."

loyos originally received a tip about Braden from a

former FBI agent who was then aiding District Attorney

Jim Garrison's investigation of the Kennedy assassination.

The FBI man told loves of Braden's presence at the scene of

the assassination at the time of the shooting.

lioyes soon found that Jin Braden was no longer at cither

of the addresses that he had given the Dallas police, and

had left no forwarding audresses.

Hoves then had the California Department of Motor Vehicles

run

a chock on the license number that Braden had given to

the Dallas

police at the Sheriff's office following the

assassination. Motor Vehicles told joyes that Braden's

(1751755) had boen renewed by Braden in San Diego

county in November of 1966. Braden has also listed new

business and home addresses, which interestingly were over

a hundred

miles apart.

The Department of l'otor Vehiclos' rocords on Jin Braden

also showed that "Jim Braden" was not really his original

name. The license had actually been issued in the 1950's

to Luacre lialc Brading, which is Braden's true identity.

On September 10, 1903, just ten wechs before the assassination,

Lugene Hale Brading had notified the Department that he had

logally changed his name to

Jim Braden,

and he requested a

new license under that name. The license was granted.

Intrigued by the fact that Jim Braden was really a false

identity assumed by Bugene Brading, investigator Noyes

contacted the Intelligence Division of the Calliornia

Attorney Genoral's Office, and had a checl run on the

mysterious brading.

Hoves was told that Eugene Hale Brading "is a real bad guy.

He's got a long rap sheet and apparantly has liafia connections."

Nojes shortly thorcafter obtained a copy of Eugene Brading's

(Jim Braden's) police records.

The Brading

"rap sheet" contained an incredible 35

soperate entries covering virtually every phase of

crininal activity, including mail fraud, embezzlement,

operating a gambling house in Miami, car theft, shop

lifting, receiving

stolen property,

and sclling wartime

gas ration coupons on the black market.

¡ost of these arrests had been made under the name of

Eugone Hale Brading, but the

police dossier on him also

showed a handful of

other aliases, including Harry Eugene

Bradley,

Gone Brady, James Lee Cole, James Bradley Lee,

and incvitably, .Jim

Braden.

"Jim Bradon" was the last ontry shown on Brading's

records.

Incredibl:, investigator lloyes found that due to the fact

that the dallas police had not fingerprinted Jim Braden or

run a make on him,

his true identity of

Bugene Brading was

nevor discovered by the FBI or the Warren Commission at the

time

of their investigation of the assassination. The Warren

Commission had only routinely included Braden's

short state

Jim Bracion (Buriche Bradinal ind The liafia

Investigator loves began a thorough investigation of

Braden based upon all available police records and

documents.

What soon clearly merged was a long record of involvement

by Braden (Brading) with many of the most notorious hafia

Icaders in

the nation, a record of close association with

key figures in the national crime syndicate.

Following a

string of arrests in the 1940's, dating all

the way back to his young adulthood, Eugene Brading had

moved to bl Paso, Texas, in 1950.

(DRADING AND PEREIRA)

In El Paso, Brading became closely associated with victor

Pereira, a

man who was a close associate and confidante of

scvCral

Mafia

members. Brading and Percira became involved

in a numbor of schemes involving marriage to and embezzlement

of wealthy widows.

In 1051,

Brading and his close friend Porcira vore arrested

by the EDI in New York on a fugitive varrant issued in Texas.

The iro

were charged with

embezzling over

$50,000 fIOm

flecing with her money. Brading and Percira were soon con-

victed of the charges

and were each sentenced to 12 years

in prison.

ycars of their appeals, and Brading was later paroled in 1959

after having served just five ycars of his sentence.

The Snaldone brothers, who were also known as "Checkers

and Flip Flon," verc. the Mafia loaders in charac of the

syndicate's vending-machine market which stretched from

the Rockies all the way to Chicago. Police records show

that at one time,

the smaldones virtually controlled the

antire lucblo arca of Colorado.

The Smaldone brothors wore notorious for the brutal brand

of violence they practiced in their operations. Brading

(Draden) becane involved in many transactions with the

Smaldones and became a close personal friend. Several years

(BRADING AND CLARK AID BAUMAIT)

Brading and his friend Pereira later moved to Beverly Hills

in California. Shortly thereafter, Brading inevitably came

under investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department

Intelligence Division's Mafia specialists.

In particular,

the LAPD interest in Brading was

focused on

his close association in Beverly Hills with two

"oil specu

lators" from Miami, Arthur Clark and Roger Bauman. Clark

and. Bauman were notorious Mafia figures with long police

records.

Brading's friend Clark had been one of the ton leaders of

che famous Purple Gang of the lafia, which had oncratec

out of Detroit and Younastown. The Los Anacles

police had

nlaced Clark and Bauman under

tight survcillance and had

comniled extensive information on their friondship with

Brading.

In 1956, the Chief of Intelligence of the LAPD, Captain

James lianilton, sent a letter to the Crime Commission of

Greater liani

seeking infornation about Clarl, Bauman, and

Brading.

Cantain Hamilton,

Who was

as one of the foremost

experts on the Mafia in the nation, asled the liami Commission

(which was conducting extensive investigations of the Mafia)

to inform him as

to the involvement of several

Clark and

Bauman.

Among those named was Bugene Brading.

Captain Hamilton's letter stated:

"This Department has under investigation Arthur

Iewis Clark, SI., FBI 3709258, and a Roger Bauman.

These men arc representing thensolves as officials

of the sunbeam Oil Company, 212 Roosevelt Theater

Building, Hiami Beach, and

"Clark has been arrested several times and has been

associated with many confidence men and hoodlums such

brothers of Denvcr."

As investigator Peter loves points out, the men listed

with Brading in the letter, reprosent a virtual "Who's iho"

of organized crime leaders

between California and the Midwest.

(BRADING AID FRATIANO)

of these top lafia men listed with Brading (Braden) perhaps

the nost important one is James Fratianno, also widely known

as "Jimmic The Heasel." Fratianno was known as perhaps the

Mafia's highest ranking executioner in the nation.

in his testinony before the Rackets Conmittee of

the california logislature, captain lamilton, the chief of

LAPD Intelligence, stated that,

"ie have lona considered Fratianno to

the exccutioner for the Mafia on

the West Coast."

Captain Hamilton told the Rackets Committec that his Intelligence

Division had linked Jimmic Fratianno to at lcast sixteen Mafia

exccutions.

Fratianno had once

been arrested for the attempted

assassination

of Los Angeles Mafia head Mickey Cohen in 1919. Conen had

survived the bloody shooting which took the lifc. of one oi

nis licutonants. Fratianno was later rolcased due to insuf-

ficient evidence. Fratianno used the alibi that he had been

at the home of lafia associate Nick Licata the night of the

shooting. Licata later became the new head of the Los Angeles

Mafia,

and, perhaps significantly, was later given control of

the Nafia in Dallas, Texas.

jimmie Iratianno was also susnocted of complicity in

the murders of two men in 1951. Two mon who made the

Flaningo Hotel in Las

Vegas were found dead in a parked car folloving the

robbery. Both of their skulls had been shattered by

bullcts

fircd behind the ear, apparantly in true Mafia

fashion.

Fratianno had al50 been linked to the famous murder of

Iarry "Hooky" Rothman, who had been another close

associate of lilclicy Cohen,

the Los Angeles Mafia head.

A150.

Fratianno was also linked to the disapocarance of

another top momber of the richey Cohen gang, Frank Hiccoli.

Niccoli had mysteriously vanished following a late dinner

at Fratianno's home one night.

Fratianno was also linked to the brutal murder of a business-

man in northern California in 1952. Thomas Keen, a wealthy

gambler, had apparantly welched on a $80, 000 gambling debt

that he owed the lafia, and was blown to bits from a dynamite

charge hidden under the hood of his car.

Pratianno later corved a six year prison

term (1954-1960) for

extortion. In later years Fratianno becane the central figure

involved

in LOOK magazine's

"exposc" of San Francisco layor

Joseph Alioto's alleged Mafia connections. LOOK alleged that

Fratianno had becone a close friend of linvor Alito and that

Mayor had arranged for Fratianno to receive loans of over

$105,000 from a bank there Alioto sorved as Chairman of the.

Board. Alioto admitted that Fratianno vas a "casual acquaintance"

of his, but denied that he had used any influence in the loans.

The lavor also said that he had not known that the notorious

Fratianno was a nember of the Mafia.

(BRADING AND MELTZER):

while in Los ingeles,

Brading (Jin Braden) also became

connected with top Mafia leader Harold "Happy" Heltzer.

The LAPD Intolligonce Division had originally become

avare of Brading's close relationship with lieltzer when

Brading's nane was found on l'oltzor's Christmas card list.

Meltzor was widel! known

as one of the most powerful lafia

Jim braden: Possible Link To Jack kub:

The samo inadequate investigative work which led the

Warren

commission to largely overlook: Jack Ruby's solid

Mafia involvement, appears also to have boon responsible

for the failure to

uncover Jin Braden's true identity of

Eugene Brading during the official invostigation into the

Kennedy assassination.

is shown

in the previous

account of Jack Ruby's very

substantial ties to the rafia, Ruby vas particularly

involved in the syndicate areas of gambling and narcotics.

But bevond the multiplicity of evidence which indicates

that Jack Ruby and Jim Braden wore both important nafia

figures opcrating in

the same general arcas, at the same

general times,

there is another sinale niece of evidence

which places both Ruby and Braden at the same place on the

day bofore the assassination.

Evidence indicatos that both Jim Braden and Jack ruby

visited the Dallas officos of the H.l. Hunt Oil Company

on the afternooi? of lovember 21, 1963, just twenty four

hours bofore the President was murdered. Obviously any

of course raise further significant questions about a

possible Iclationship between the tro men.

Jim Braden

received pernission from the U.s. Board of

November 18, 1903,

Braden was roguired to report all of his travels to his

Parole Board folloving his parole in 1959 for the embez-

zlement conviction.

On November 21, 1963, the day before the assassination,

Jin Braden

checked in with the U.s. Parole Office in

Dallas. According to Roger Carroll

the Chief Parole

officer in Dallas, Braden (Brading) "advised that ne

plannod

to soe Lamar

here." Lamar lunt is the son of H.L. Hunt, the famous

right-ving oil billionaire.

has' recalled that he distinctly renombers Braden visiting

other men. Rothernel has stated that the office 10g for

ilovember

21 showed that Roger Bauman (Brading's old Mafia

friend and lorgan Brown and Duane Howlin "and friend"

Hunt office on that afternoon. Rothermel statcs

that Braden

also on November 21, the day before the assussination,

iccording to a conclusion oi the warren commission, Jac!

uly was also on his wy to the Mol. Hunt ofiices in ballas.

The Warren Commission concluded that Jacl Ruby drove a woman

the lunt offices somotime that same after-

noor. The roman, who had acclined work in ruiy's nightclub

as a stripper, drove with Ruby to the lunt offices, apparantly

of enployment. This does coincide with Braden's

visit to the same offices on that same afternoon.

The Warron Comminsion investigated soveral other possible

lints of Jack Ruby to the Hunts,

including the still

nernlained fact that Lamar Hunt's name was found insido

one of Ruby's notebooks. But of these possible lints, the

Warren Commission concluded only that evidence dia indicate

that ruby had drivon to the lunt offices on Movember 21.

Thus a possible ruby-Braden conncction on the day before

Jim Bricion: jossible link to David Forric

Investigator Ictor Moyes has turned up several pieces

of information which indicate a possible connection between

Jim Braden and the mysterious David Ferris.

David Forric was the homosekual airline nilot and private

invostinator thon Jim

Garrison

accused of participating

in the plot to assassinate President Kennedy. Six days after

District ittorney Garrison's charges vere made public, David

Ferric was found

dead in his apartmont in New Orleans. His

mysterious death. was finally ruled to have been a suicide.

David Ferric has been

a target of investigation !! critics

of the warren Connission ever since the rosassination. In

fact the FBI and

secret sorvice both investigated a possible

Ferrie role immodiatoly after the

assassination. It was

widely rumored in Me. Orleans

and Dallas that Forrie vas

to

have flown

the alleged assassins out of the country following

assassination. The warren Commission docided not to include

the official secret service and FBI roports or ferric in

26 Volumes of lierrinas wich vere released after the liarren

lenori was issued. However,

Justico Department did finall!

release those renorto io

the National Archives in 1957 following

Garrison's public accusations.

Author Hoyes

has sinon establishod that both Jim Braden

Davod Ferrie worked out of themfloor of offices in a building

in Now Orleans

in the month or two immediately preceding the

assassination.

This

is particularly significant due to the fact that at that

time the mysterious

David

Ferrie was cnploved as a privato

investigator by Carlos Marcollo, the cop lafia kingvin. It

is widely believed by nost federal authorities that Carlos

Harcollo rans with his close friend licyer Lansly as one of

the two single most powerful loadors of the infia's national

and intornational crime syndicate. Carlos inrcello heads the

l'afia empire centered in New Orlcans, Louisiana, and controls

nost of the Mafia activity in the southern part

of the United

states.

In Septenber and Octobor of 1963, just woeks before the

assascination, David Ferrie was working out of tie offices

of Carlos lincollo's criminal attorney, G. Wray Gill. Ferrie,

who was doing investigative work on a

nerjury charge that his

boss liarcello was then encing,

worked out of Room 1707 in the

Fore larauctte Building in dew Orleans.

it this same time, in september and october of 1963, Jim

Braden was operating out of room 1701 in the Fere inrouetic

Building.

was working as a representative of his lafia

fricnd Roger Bauman, the oil speculator. Braden worked

Room 1701, which was

the office

of his associate,

Victor Main,

an oil geologist. This was just a short

way down the hall from David ferrie in Room 1707.

Intorestinaly, in one visit to his Parole Offico, Braden

"nistakenly""

told his Parole Officer that he was working

out of loom 1700 - which would have bech the room next

door to Ferric - instead of Room 1701.

Thus a possible Braden-Ferrie connection in the weeks

just bofore the assassination does indeed arise in addition

to the possible Braden-Ruby connection. Both connections

definitely do seem to fall outside of or beyond the arca

which could reasonably be attributed to coincidence, chance,

or circumstance.

Bavond soveral soto of information wich tend to indicate

that David Ferric had some contact with Loe Oswald at

various

times;

the critics of the warren Commission have

particularly focused on Ferric's ties to Carlos Marcello

and the Marcello lafia empire.

In fact, in his interviews with the FBI and Secret Service

after the assassination, Forrie clained that he was with

Marcello at the very time of the assassination. Ferrie

stated that he was

in court with harcello on the afternoon

of Novenber 22, which does

appear to be true.

Carlos Marcello, alona with leyer Lansky,

had becone the

of the Justice Department's Organized

Crine Division in the carly loon's, under the vigorous

diroction of Attorney General Robert Kenncay.

Marcollo once claimed that he had boon kidhanpod under orders

of Robert kennedy and the Justice Department.

Sa Reid,

author of the Greenicit Junale and widely recognized

as one of the most respected exports on the Mafia

nation, has written that Carlos. Marcello once threatened

have President Kennedy and his brother murdered. Reid has

written that

he was told of Marcello's threat by an informant

who attended a secret meeting with Marcello in New Orleans in

september of 1902.

iccordina to Roirl's informant, Marcello told his too

lieutenants, "Don't worry about that little Bobby

sonofabitch. He's going to be taken care of." The

informant stated that Marcello said that President

Kennedy himself would have to be killed first, and

that his brother would then follow. The informant

further stated that Marcello spoke of using some "nut"

Jim Bradion: author Peter loves And Judae Bvrne

Peter Moyes, the investigative reporter who uncovered

material

regarding Jim Braden (iugene Brading),

is a former classmate and close friend of Judge latthew

Byrne, JI.

the U.S. District. Court Judoc who prosided

over

the Bilsberg

Pentagon Papers trial last year.

As is now well known, Judge Byrne dismissed the case

against Ellsbera

nfter he was notified that the white

House "Plumbers" had once burglarized the office of

Ellsberg's psychiatrist.

A short time later, it became known that Fresident Nixon

had twice instructed John thrlichnan to anproach Judge

Byrne during the course of the illsberg trial and offer him

the position of Diroctor of the FBI. This offer, which Judge

Byrne refused, has been regarded as a potentini

act of

bribery by some critics of President ilixon, and

is currently

under investigation by the Soccial Frosecutor's Office.

It has been wicely assumed that llixon's fervent interest

in the outcone of the prosecution of Ellabore may: have

been the motivation benind his approach to Judge

byrnc.

Author Moves has writton of his friend Judge Byrne's

involvement in his research on Jim Braden. In 195?,

very impressed by the subatantive evidence

which Hoves had gathered. During one of these rectings with

Byrne and another

PBI man whom Byrne haci invited to attend,

the Fil man told loves that the fBI had never before known

that Jin Bradon - the man arrested at the scene of the

assassination in 1903 - vas

actually sugone Erading. the

FBI man said that the Burcau must have made a big mistal

in not tracing down Braden's true identity and police recora.

The FBI man

was nearly incredulous over lloyes' cvidence on

Braden.

loyes meanwhile had discovored that Jim Braden had also been

in Los Angeles on the night that Robert kennedy was assassinated

in carly June of 1968.

Though Toyes couldn't find any significant information indicating

any Braden conncction to the second kennedy murder, he and his

friend Matt Byrne Forwarded the information on Braden to the

The la Costa Country Club had become, under the direction

of doc Dalitz and liever Lansky, a key "watering hole" of

the syndicate. La Costa was originally financed through a

syndicate deal with James Hoffa of the Teamsters. Onc of

known in

Intelligence authorities in southern California have long

regardod la Costa as a nrime hangout for the Mafia. Some

officials have dubbed it "Apalachin West."

Long before

his recent murder,

John Rosselli, the CIA's underworld

recruit in attempts to kill Fidel Cas-

agents of the Cuban premier, in retali-

ation, were involved in the assassina•

tion of President John F. Kennedy.

Rosselli's belief in a Cuban

connec

tion to the Kennedy assassination was

expressed through his attorney, Ed-

ward P. Morgan, to the FBI as long

ago as March, 1967, and also in private.

ate of Rosselli who participated

in

meetings between Rosselli and the

CIA.

has confirmed that Morgan and Rosselli

. were the sources of the testimony that

suggested a Cuban role in the Ken-

Morgan's account, according. to a

summary of the FBl interview,

was

that Rosselli had reached his conclu-

The JFK Assassination: Curiosity in Havana

An inquisitive American learns many things on a

visit to Cuba. One of the most surprising is that high

officials in Havana seem genuinely hopeful that the

investigation of the Kennedy assassination will be re-

opened. They are convinced that there was a Cuban

factor in the murder.

•Conversations with senior officials of the Cuban

government, including Deputy Prime Minister Carlas.

Rafael Rodriguez, make clear that they have followed

closely the disclosures by the Senate Intelligence

Committee casting doubt upon the Warren Commis-

sion investigation. The Cubans are well aware that the

doubts center on the failure of the CLA and the FBI to

inform the Warren Commission of the several plots

mounted by the CIA to kill Fidel Castro. Knowledge

of these plots appears to have been withheld even

from the FBI and CIA officials who were responsible

for investigating the President's murder and for sup-

porting the work of the Warren Commission. As a re-

sult, there was no special effort to explore the possi-

ble involvement of either the Cuban government or

Cuban exiles in the assassination. Evidence developed

by the Senate committee makes both hypotheses plau-

sible and a new inquiry imperative.

The situation is murkier and more perplexing than

ever. Those who are resistant to conspiracy theories

and who have been prepared-even, eager —to be-

lieve that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone can no

longer rely on the Warren Commission report as an

"The writer is a senior fellow of the Council on For.

eign Relations:

adequate prop for their predilections. The commis-,

sion did not know that on Nov. 22, 1983, at about the

very hour Oswald struck in Dallas, an agent of the

Central Intelligence Agency was meeting with a rank-

ing Cuban

official (code-named AMLASH and re.

cently identified as Rolando Cubela) to plan the mur•:

der of Castro. Simultaneously, in Cuba, a French re-

porter, Jean Daniel, was spending the day with Cas-

tro, conveying to the Cuban leader views expressed

by President Tengedy in a brief interview at the:

White House on Oct. 2t, persuading Castro that Ken-i

nedy wanted to explore ways to normalize relations.

• Thus, at the moment the President was killed, U.S.

pollcy toward Cuba appeared to be moving not only

on two tracks but in opposite directions, and move:

ment on either track could have provoked violent re-

sponse by one or another Cuban faction.

Perceptions inside the Cuban government re-

sponded to both tendencies in U.s. policy. There is

good reason to suspect that the AMLASH operation

involved a double agent, or at least a singularly inept

one. Castro almost certainly knew of it. The CLA even-

tually concluded that the AMLASH activity was "inse-

cure"

and terminated it. Among other discoveries.

within two days of the assassination it was known (but

not to the Warren Commission) that AMLASH bad

been in contact with Soviet personnel in Mexico City, i

where Oswald had gone in September 1963 to visit

hoth the Cuban and Soviet consulates. Whether these .

facts are significant or merely coincidental, one can-

not tell. In retrospect, Cuban authorities note with

some relief that Oswald was denied permission to visit

Cuba, implying that, had his request been granted:

the finger of suspicion would surely have pointed at

Havana.

Perhaps more suggestive of a direct leak from AM:

LASH to Castro was the sequence of events on Sept. 7,

1963, when the CIA re-established contact with the Cu-

ban conspirator for the first time since the preceding

: year. Late that evening, Prime Minister Castro called

in Associated Press reporter Daniel Harker for an un-

expected interview. Only three Western reporters.

were based in Havana at the time and their contact

with Castro was quite limited. Evidently, the Cuban

leader had a message he wished to get on the record

through Harker. He charged that the United States

was aiding terrorist plots in Cuba and warned U.S.

leaders that "if they are aiding terrorist plans to elimi-

nate Cuban leaders, they themselves will not be safe."

This threat of reprisals seems less inflammatory

and more understandable now that we know what

Castro knew at the time, namely, that the United

States was in fact stepping up its covert operations

against Cuba during the summer and fall of 1963. Yet

it seems an exception to the main lines of Cuban pol-

icy as it was then evolving.

For months afer the missile crisis of 196%, Castro

had been displeased with the Soviets, and there are

signs that he was interested in an opening to Wash-

ington. On Sept. 5, the Cubans quietly proposed. talks

have no recollection of consulting with Scott on that

more hopeful relations between the two countries.

The John Kennedy of 1963 was not, in their judgment.

the same man who was inaugurated in 1961, but a

more mature, poised and forward-looking leader with 7

whom they could have done business.

With this frame of reference, Cuban officials specu-

late that the real origin of the assassination lies in an..

ti-Castro circles, with which Oswald also was in touch.

• They emphasize that assassination is incompatible

with their own revolutionary doctrine and that they

never contemplated it even against Batista, the pre-

vious Cuban ruler. And they volunteer the suspicion #

that the recent murders of Sam Giancana and Johnny

Rosselli, the Mafia figures who consorted with the

CIA to kill Castro, surely have some connection with

Cuban exile politics and the Kennedy murder.

Castro has said publicly that he bas no proof "count-

er-revolutionary elements" planned the assassination,

but that is clearly the consensus in Havana. Furthera

investigation may still be inconclusive, but, far from:

seeing it as an impediment to Cuban-American rela-

tions, the Castro regime welcomes such an inquiry.

• about the CIA plots - which could

have been the incentive for pro:

Castro forces to kill Kennedy -

had been kept from the Warren

Commission.

"I was an admirer of Earl War-

that the Chief Justice could put his

High officials in the Cuban gov-

THERE HAVE been theories re-

to

show

both pro and

why

could have wanted to get JFK out

On the one hand, there is the re-

port of French journalist Jean Dan-

of an offer from JFK for calmer re-

lations.

Castro

was

reportedly

agreeable. The report stated that.

Daniel later was .lunching

with.

Castro when word came that Ken-

i nedy had been

shot. Daniel

de-

scribed the Cuban leader as genu-

inely shocked by the news.

It has since been learned that

probably in the very hour JFK was

shot, a one-time Castro supporter

was receiving a poison pen device

from a CIA agent in what was it

long-running

anti-Castro

That Cuban agent was code-named

AM/LASH, and he has since been

all said he had no knowledge of

such plots and would never have

approved of them.

George Smathers,

Kennedy discussed

the ramifica

Smathers has since said Kennedy

rejected the idea and that the dis.

cussion was more of a "brain-pick-

ing" session.

AT LEAST one high-level CIA

official did testify he believed the

White House was being briefed on

the plots but according to Richard

was through the method of "plau-

sible deniability."

That, according

cials to deny knowledge of an op-

world plotters, first made public by

the Senate Committee,

involved. Judith Campbell Exner,

There is documentation to show

that on March 22, 1962, Hoover

and presumably gave him his first

few hours later.

Another possible link discussed

PURPOSE:

BARON

To advise you that an Agent of the Secret Service,

testilying before the President's Conmission, denied naking certain

statements to FBI Agents which vere subsequently reported to the

Commission. i

DETÄILS:

In Volume iI of the hearings before the President's

Connission conmencing on page 61 there appears the testimony

of Roy Il. Lellernan, Assistant Special Agent, White House Detail,

U.S. Secret Service on 3-9-6%.

*In Charge

:. ...

Under questioning by a Conmission member, Kellerman

was asked about certain statements reportedly made by him on

11-22-63, to SA's Francis ¼: O Neill, Ji. and Janes W. Sibert,

of our Baltinore Office, which appear in the 12-10-63 Dallas

: (page 3, paragraph

SA'S O'Neill and Sibert were under orders to be observel's

during the autopsy of resident Kennedy at the lational Naval •

Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, which commenced on the

evening of 11-22-63, to be oi assistance to the secret Service;

and to look after the Bureau's interests.

• A. Bosen to Mr. Belmont Memo

RE: PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION

The Conmission in questioning Kellerman made specific

reference to the underscored portions of the above paragraph

as it contradicts some of Kellerman's testimony. Kellerman

claims he did not hear the President nor Mrs. Kennedy say

these things and hud never told our Agents that he had.

part of Kellerman's denial he stated "I don't know where they

got those quotes."

OBSERVATIONS:

Kellerman is claiming our Agents furnished inaccurate

accounts of a conversation with hin.

It is to be remembered

that at the time this conversation with our Agents reportedly

took place 11-22-63, Kellerman had been a security guard in

the President's car

and more than likely was upset and feeling

remoise over the days episode.

In his testimony before

Commission he endeavored to give the impression that he'acted

" calmly and immediately took command, issuing logical instructions

after the Presiddnt was hit.

The conversation reported by

our agents made it appear Kellerman reacted normally to the

tragedy and not dramatically as indicated in his testimony,

as he didn't order the driver to the hospital until after the

President had so directed.

It is felt our Agents reported accurately what

Kellerman

told them on 11-22+63, and that Kellerman's testimony

32 months later is the result of considered deliberation, on

his part, to paint the most favorable picture possible, under

the circumstances, for the Secret Service.

Consideration has been given to discussing this matter

with Chief Rowley of Secret Service,

hovever, since it is the

word of our Agents against Kellerman's, it is not felt any good

purpose would be served by this course of action.

RECOMMENDATION:

Affidavits are being obtained from our Agents Sibert

and O'Naill attesting to the accuracy of their report and

refuting kellerman so that we vill be in a position to show

any future inquirer that we recognized this contradiction and

did

something about it.

2.

We believe that the Italian diplomat on the Cubana

flight No. 465 on 22 November 1963 from Mexico City to Havana,

Cuba,

was Mario MAURI who was accompanied by his wife, Maria

Antonieta

MAURI. We have been unable to determine who trans-

mitted the'information

to CIA and we

have not been able to locate any documents relating to this

matter in Latin America Division files or the Oswald files.

3. We have been unable to locate any documents which

would indicate that there was a response

Mexico City.

Assuming there was no response

the

originating Headquarters component

should have initiated

follow-up action if a response was not received.

We have been unable to find any further information

relating to

Latin America Division files.

It has now been disclosed that the

According to the final report, ihe

JACK ANDERSON

Plot to kill

Kissinger

blocked

WASHINGTON - A reported plot to assassinate Sec-

retary of State Henry Kissinger in Costa Rica six months

ago was blocked by US and Costa Rican authorities four

days before it was supposed to be carried out.

We have pieced together the story from secret lestimo-

ny before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee and

from interviews with Cuban exiles and US intelligence

sources.

A Cuban terrorist named Orlando Bosch Avila was re-

ported to be gunning for Kissinger. The attempt on the

Secretary's life was

expected, according to underground

reports, during his visit to Costa Rica last February.

Shortly before Kissinger's arrival, Bosch slipped into

Costa Rica on a false passport. But the FBI and Secret Ser-

vice had been alerted. They traced Bosch's movements and

notified the Costa Rican authorities. The suspected assas-

sin was arrested and clapped into a tiny jail cell four days

before Kissinger got to town.

The plot to kill Kissinger apparently grew out of his

overtures to improve relations with Cuba's Fidel Castro

back in 1972. This reportedly upset an anti-Castro terrorist

band, known as Cuban Action, which Bosch headed

We reported part of the story two years later after a

lengthy investigation in Miami. In columns on Sept. 1 and

Nov. 12, 1974, we warned that anti-Castro terrorists

planned an "assassination ... against American congress-

men and businessmen who supported a ... thaw." We noted

that Kissinger had been in touch with Castro:

The first hint that Kissinger, himself, was one of the

targets came later from Carlos Rivero Collado, son of the

man elected to the presidency of Cuba in 1958, Rivero was

active in the anti-Castro underground in Miami's little

Havana. But he later re-defected to Cuba where he gave a

fascinating interview.

"I have known privately since 1972," he said, "(about)

the plan to assassinate the US Secretary of State." He said

the plot had' taken "certain form" by 1973 and had been

"actualized" by 1974.

Then, in a reference to our 1974 columns, he added:

"This fact which, I repeat, I've known privately, has been

corroborated by the US journalist Jack Anderson."

Rivero named Bosch as one of the 18 anti-Castro l

ers who had conspired to kill US and other leaders pron

ing a Cuban-American detente. Bosch already had bi

convicted in 1968 of shelling a Polish freighter with a

• zooka while it was moored in Miami. He jumped Fede.

parole and fled to Venezuela ir 1974.

Months later, he was reported to be in Curacao, pr

lected by Chilean gunmen. He bragged, according to u

reports, of his "money, friends and protection."

Florida's Dade County Public Safety Department, be

cause of the huge Cuban population in Miami, has excellen

ties throughout Latin America. In early 1976, tbe county':

terrorist expert, Lt.: Thomas Lynch, picked up some electri-

fying news.

He told the Senate Subcommittee about it in secret tes

timony. "We received information from confidential sourc-

es," he swore, "that there was going to be an attempt on the

life of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger... We passed the

information on to the FBI, and they had also received the

information, and we notified the Secret Service, as they.

have the protective duty for the Secretary of State."

The plot was linked to Kissinger's two-day stay in Cos-

la Rica, and Bosch was picked up and questioned. He was

held on a false passport charge until Kissinger was safely

out of the country.

Bosch later insisted: "My only crime was entering the

country with a false passport." Certainly, it was never

proved in court that he hoped to knock off Kissinger. He is

now at large somewhere in Latin America.

* Columnist. Drew Pearson went to

the late Chief Justice of the United

Earl Warren late in January,

1967, and told him that a Washington

lawyer had confided to him that one

of his clients said the United States

"had attempted to assassinate Fidel

Castro in the early 1960s and Castro

had decided to retaliate."

Warren declined Pearson's sugges-

tion that he see the lawyer, who was

Edward Morgan. Warren referred the

matter to then Secret Service Direc-

tor James J. Rowley, who on Feb. 13,

1967, wrote FBI Director J. Edgar Ho-

over, informing him of the allegations.

Hoover sent the Rowley letter to six

senior

bureau officials on an

"eyes-

only" basis. There is no record of FBI

meetings or discussions of those alle-

gations. At that point the sensitive let-

ter bounced back and forth in the

higher reaches of the FBI bureauc-

racy.

The job of responding to Rowley's

letter was assigned to the supervisor

of the FBl's General Investigative Di-

vision who was given responsiility for

the overall assassination investigation

in March 1964.

This official's job was complicated

by the fact that he had never been in-

MEMORANDUM TO THE PRESIDENT

SUBJECT: Sabotage against Castro

Three small-scale sabotage operations have been approved by the

Special Group, but this recommendation is based on a routine con-

tinuation of broad policy guidance which I think you may wish

to review. The three operations involved

are:

(1) a commando sabotage operation against a coastal

warehouse and pier;

(2) a sabotage attack against naval or patrol vessels in

a harbor; and

(3) a sabotage operation against a fuel barge proceeding

in coastal waters.!

All of these operations would have been approved three months ago,

and indeed one of them is a rescheduling of an operation aborted

because of high seas.

While it is always hard to predict the noise

level in these matters, these operations seem comparable to the

small attack on a Cuban naval patrol which occurred in late December

which Castro promptly blamed on you (in fact it was an operation

approved before November 22 and not cancelled thereafter because it

seemed to fall within the guidance you expressed in your first review

of the Cuban problem).

The policy question now is this: If we continue these even small

sabotage operations, Castro will certainly know it. Equally, if we

call them off, he will know it, and so will the Russians.

We thus

have an opportunity to choose.

I doubt if this choice should be made on momentum alone.

I therefore recommend a Cabinet-level review of the whole principle

of covert sabotage against Cuba. I know that Rusk has never liked it

and that McNamara thinks it does very little good.

McCone and the CIA

are for it, and so are most of the middle-level officers dealing with the

Castro problem. I myself consider the matter extremely evenly balanced,

but before hearing full argument, my guess is that in your position

I would stop sabotage attacks on the ground that they are illegal,

ineffective, and damaging to our broader policy. I might then wish

to make a little capital from this decision with the Soviet Union.

Connection Between Amlash Operation and Investigation

of JFK Assassination

DATE:

SUBJ:

Background

The staff's memorandum of January 5, 1976, postulated that the

Amlash operation might have had some effect on

CIA's response to

the investigation of President Kennedy's assassination.

On January

9, 1976, the staff asked for access to the Amlash file at CIA; and

after a delay which was not explained, the staff was permitted to

review the file on January 23 and 26.

Summary of Amlash File

Amlash initially contacted by CIA in 1961 met occasionally with

case officers through August 1962, at which time he was given instruc-

tion in secret writing and explosives.

Interest in Amlash continued

after the August meetings, but there was no further direct contact by CIA

agents until mid-1963.

Why there was a year lapse in contact with Am-

lash cannot be determined; the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962

undoubtedly made CIA cautious in dealing with Amlash.

In any event, DIR 4819g*

to Rome of 19 June 1963 states that

Anwhip, a Cuban exile who assisted CIA, had sent a letter as part of

an "activation effort to reluctant dragon." Presumably, Amlash was

"reluctant dragon" and was, by this letter, asked to recontact CIA.

In late August, Amlash traveled with a large contingent of Cuban

officials and athletes to

He cabled Amwhip

about his arrival on August 29. This cable apparently was

the signal

that he was prepared to meet Amwhip

Amwhip and two CIA case officers met with Amlash

between September 5 and 8. The two case officers have testified to

the Committee about their understanding of events at this series of

meetings which they viewed essentially as a get acquainted session.

CIA messages tell a different story.

10704 to DIR öf 7

September stated that Amlash told Amwhip he felt there were only two

ways of getting rid of Castro. The first was an invasion by U.S.

forces which Amlash knew was out of the question and the second was

an "inside job."

Amlash indicated he was awaiting a U.S. plan of action.

He

referred to the

explosives demonstration CIA gave him a year earlier

as

"too cumbersome" for his purposes.

* DIRs are messages

At the conclusion of the meetings with Amlash, Headquarters

cabled on 9 September that, based on what little feel Headquarters

approach appa d hot cong

He should be urged to recruit a

and more serious matters on an orderly basis. (DIR 67110

On 11 September,

ligence information Amlash had given on Soviet units

in Cuba, saying

all IRBM and bombers had been removed. By this time Amlash had left

Brazil apparently heading for a vacation in Europe.

20...

A document in the file dated 16 September and marked OFPA 72775

appears to be a transcript of a conversation obtained by covert means.

There is no indication as to where the conversation takes place, but

it probably is in the Cuban Embassy in Paris.

"Mary: I don't want to imagine things but

this thing of Amlash.

Moreno:

It is either

a tremendous secret or a

Lop sectet matter (unreadable) then the

word "treason" or "reason").

Betty: I believe it is a top secret matter."

By letters of September 14 and September 16, Amlash stayed in

contact with Anwhip.

Paris stacion apparently was picking up responsi

bility for Amlash at this

time, since

Paris 0706

to DIR dated 19

September asks for some background material on Amlash.

On 19 September, JMWAVE 4580 to DIR warns that Amlash is part of

an anti-communist group in Cuba and details the membership of his group

as well as a communist group. The message also notes that Fidel is

allegedly aware of the two groups and acts as moderator between them

in order to maintain cohesion in the Government of Cuba.

Nevertheless, Amwhip is asked to continue to work with Amlash

and is assigned to accompany him around Europe. According to Paris

0934 to. DIR dated ? October, Amlash met with case officer O* on 5

October.

Case officer O sat and listened permitting Amlash to get

everything off his chest. Amlash seemed to be complaining about the

low level espionage matters that had been discussed at the September

meeting

implying he had a more valuable role.

Case officer

O "provided necessary assurances his feelings not in fact true and

that his case receiving consideration highest levels. (emphasis added)!''

"With this problem which had undoubtedly been bothering Amlash con-

siderably, off his chest, a much more relaxed Amlash departed restating

his desire return Cuba to undertake 'the big job:

On October 15, London 5224 to DIR states case officer O met with

and Anwhip on 13 October. Although. the case officer had been

forewarned by Anwhip, he was not successful in discouraging Amlash's

request for a high level meeting.

"Amlash convinced that if such meet

does not take place at this time

it will be almost impossible come out

again and we will be in same situation

as last year with no definite

decision.

Also finds it difficult

to believe why RFK who receives many

Cubans would refuse to see a major" such as Amlash. The message notes

the fact remains that Amlash does "have excellent entree to highest

target level which believe we cannot afford overlook."

This message seemingly moved Headquarters to re-evaluate Amlash's

role. DIR 75683 to London on 15 October directed case officer O to

return headquarters soonest for discussions of all phases of the case.

The next meeting apparently took place on October 29. One case

officer met Amlash holding himself out as the personal representative

of REK.

He informed Amlash,

according to a 13 November MFR, that

the U.S. was prepared to render all necessary assistance to

any anti-

communist Cuban group which succeeded in neutralizing the present Cuban

leadership and which assumed significant control to invite

the U.S.

to render assistance.

He emphasized that U.S: support could come only

after a

successful coup. Amlash responded by saying that without Fidel,

ne milltary would break up into 4 or 5 groups and the regime woul

disintegrate.

He also said he was satisfied with the policy discussio

but desired to know what technical support he could get.

Since Anwhip was closer to Amlash than the case officers, he was

asked about Amlash's reaction to the

meeting.

His reactions

are

summarized in Attachment A to Anwhip's Memo of Meeting dated 14 Novem-

ber. Anwhip said Amlash was still not pleased with support from U.S.

government. While Amlash was satisfied on policy grounds, he was not

at all happy with the fact that he still was not given the technical

assistance for the operation plan as he saw it.

Amlash could not under-

stand why he was denied certain small pieces of equipment which promised

a tinal solution to the problem, while, on the other hand, the U.s. gave

much equipment and money to exile groups for their ineffective excursions

against Cuban coastal targets.

The memorandum ends with

In a Memo for Record dated 19 November, one case officer summarized

the actions to be taken at the next meeting with Amlash.

Amlash was

to

be told the U.S. was prepared to give full

support to Amlash's coup.

He would be shown President Kennedy's speech in Miami of November 18

and told this reaffirmed support for Amlash's proposal. Headquarters

had approved giving Amlash

scopes and rifles

and other equipment.

memo ended by stating that "C/SAS* requested written reports on Amlash

operation be kept to a minimum."

Pari 1564 to DIR of 20 November indicated Amlash had been called

on the night of November 20 and had agreed to postpone his return

Cuba in order to see case officer O "if it something interesting."o

CIA officer said he could not assure it was interesting but that it was

to be a meeting which Amlash had requested.

Obviously, CIA wanted

to

give Amlash the

"technical support" he felt he had not been promised in

the 29 October meeting.)

Case officer O flew from the U.S.. so as to arrive in Paris on the morn-

ing of November 22 for this meeting.

Pari 1607 to DIR received at Langley at 6:25 a.m. on 23 November

is the only message

in Amlash's file reflecting the fact the meeting

had taken place.

It indicated that Amlash was anxious to return to

Cuba and that case officer O was to arrive in Washington at 1810 that

day.

The file contains no outgoing cable to Paris on November 23 or

any other time telling Paris to break contact with Amlash.**

On 25 November, a contact report was prepared. There is reason

to question the authenticity of this document which is three pages

and reports the 22 November meeting with Amlash.

The first two pages

have dark type as though prepared on a typewriter with a new ribbon.

a poison pen to Amlash.

On November 27, Pari 1669 to DIR reports information obtained

in October possibly by clandestinely listening devices.

A source com-

plained bitterly about official (Cuban) visitors to Paris and how they

denigrate the revolution..

The source said she wished she had a con-

cealed tape recorder to record these conversations.

She named Amlash

as one of these visitors.

in 3 December, Headquarters furnished JMWAVE some details on the

Amlash meeting including

the fact that he had been promised "full U.Si

support if he is successful in a real coup against the Castro regime.

He was

also promised arms which will have to be furnished through

IMWAVE's operations.

A series of confusing cables passed between Headquarters and JMWAVE

on December 6, 7, and 8.

Apparently, Headquarters first gave JMWAVE

authority to

Then Headquarters called

off the operation.

In DIR 87615 of ! December, it is noted "major

top level Cuban/Caribbean policy review scheduled early next week which

should provide basis for decision.

JMWAVE complained about the change in orders in a cable of 8

December. JMWAVE 8702 pointed out that one Headquarter's message

indicated December infiltration operations were approved by higher author-

ity but a

second message indicated a scheduled operation should be de-

layed and not run in December.

Headquarters responded in DIR 87880. Headquarters procedure

was to present infiltration operation plans to "higher authority"

even though there is a reasonable chance operation may

be postponed

or delayed as was

case with the scheduled operation.

"This procedure

will secure approval for the operation with only telephonic recontirma-

tion needed when previously relaxed operation finally mounted."

Head

quarters recommended delay until

January after considering and equating

objectives against risk

factors

for Amlash and others.

"Believe by

January,

CIA should be in position better evaluate status of internal

assets.

By Pari 1914 of 13 December, Paris reported that Amlash left

Paris for Prague on November 27 but did not seek recontact with case

officer.

DIR 90966 to JMWAVE of 23 December reported that Havana radio

on 2 December stated Amlash arrived Cuba on

• 1 December.

The last document in Amlash's file for the period ending December

1963, is a long report on Amlash, but it does not contain information

relevant to the October-November activities.

Nevertheless, in red pen

on the cover page appears:

"Dec 1963 Not to leave this office

on Nestor's

(Sanchez) orders." followed by initials that appear to be

"GM."

One later document in the Amlash file contains more information

about the November 22, 1963 meeting.

That document, a rough draft of

a biographical information sheet on Amlash (no final draft was found)

appears to have been preparediin 1966 at the time of Amlash's arrest

for a later plot against Castro. It states:

"22 Nov. 63 Mr. Fitzgerald

and

Mr. Sanchez assured subject

that

this Agency would give him every-

thing he needed (telescopic sight, silencer, all the money he wanted).

The situation changed when Mr. Sanchez and Mr. Fitzgerald left the meet-

ing to discover that President Kennedy had been assassinated. Because

of this fact, plans with subject changed and it was decided that this

included the following.

"We would not furnish the silencer, nor scope

nor any money for direct assassination; furthermore, we would not lift

a finger to help subject escape from Cuba should he

assassinate Castro."

The same document states this message was communicated to Amlash

in November 1964 by Mr. Sanchez.

Despite this decision, the CIA in fact continued to assist Amlash

through a cut-out until Amlash's arrest in 1966.

Later documents on Amlash are also relevant to the September-

November 1963 Amlash operation.

Several such documents report informa-

tion received to the effect that Fidel Castro had long been aware of

Amlash's plots against him.

for example, Amlash's one time Cubar

mistress was believed to be working for Cuban intelligence and hei

brother was known to be with Cuban intelligence. Pari 8242 to DIR

in December 1964 warns that Amlash's objective may be known to too

many Cubans.

And, one CIA informant reported in 1966 on one known

double agent of Cuban intelligence working for CIA and said the CIA's

Cuban operations had been penetrated at a high level by Cuban intel-

ligence. He identified this latter individual only as one of the Cuban

exiles who was knowledgeable of a number of the most important opera-

tions.

Nevertheless, Amlash's

file contains nothing to indicate any

detailed analysis of these possible penetrations of the CIA's Amlash

operation,

although a cryptic handwritten note on at least one re-

port rejects the suggestion that Amlash was himself reporting to Castro.

gave

One other document bears on the testimony Amlash's case officers

before the Select Committee to the effect that Amlash was given

a poison pen for self-protection.

That document reports that Amlash,

and other Cuban officials in Paris in 1963, were carrying pistols for

self-protection throughout their travel in Europe.

This doctrine is based on the proposition that

the decision has been reached that the U.s. cannot live

with a Castro/communist regime in Cuba which continues

America and that we are determined to take appropilate

action to put an end to these acts.

an adequate hemispheric safeguard and therefore that the

United States must unilaterally declare (see 5. below).

to the Soviet Union that further behavior of this sort

by Castro will compel the U.S. to adopt drastic measures.

Point out to the soviet Union the physical vulnerability

of cuba as well as the effect a failure to resolve the

Cuban problem will have on the traditional policy which

the U.S. has pursued of not exerting pressures upon the

Soviets! European satellites. Make it plais that the U.S.

Acceptiag as valid the Attorney General's statement

that there is no point in discussing courses of action

with respect to Cuba until the fundamental decision 1g

States to live with castro, the tollowing possible

courses of action are listed under the headingg "Can

Live with Castro" and "Can't Live with Castro." Neither

of these headings is absolute; the courses of

action

listed under each are indicative of degrees of accepta-

bility of the Castro regime or conversely the urgency

to overthrow 1t.

COURSES OF ACTION

A. Can Live with Castro

l. Negotiate a detente with Fidel looking towards

to one compatible with the requirements of a peaceful

Latin American Island republic.

No covert activitles would be undertaken and

intelligence operations would be of a nature compat

You mist realize that you will cone under tremendous pressures with any attempt

to do FPCC work in that area and

that you will not be able to operate in the manner

which is conventional here in the north-east. Even most of our big city Chapters have

been forced to abandon the idea of operating an office in public. The national office

here in New York is the only one in the country, today and the flew York City Chapter

uses our office too so it is the only Chapter with an office. Most Chapters have dis

covered that it is easier to operate semi-privately out of a home arid maintain a P.O.

organization to guarnatee the continued contact with the national even if an incividual

recommend that you engage in one at the very beginning but wait and see how you can

tive." Second question: What does the American gov-

ernment expect to gain from the blockade? Is the

economic isolation of Cuba a punishment or a political

maneuver?

Kennedy's reply: "Are you suggesting that the polit-

ical effectiveness of the blockade is uncertain [smile]?

You will see when you go to Cuba whether it is or nut.

In any case, we can't let Communist subversion win in

• the other Latin American countries. Two dikes are

needed to contain Soviet expansion: the blockade on

the one hand, a tremendous effort toward progress on

the other. This is the problem in a nutshell. Both battles

are equally difficult." (Silenice.) Then, a last comment:

"The continuation of the blockade depends on the con-

tinuation of subversive activities."

The interview was over. I did not really wish to sug-

gest anything, since I had never been to Cuba and,

on the other hand, I had heard from all sides tales of

the privations the Cuban people were sulfering owing

to their isolated economic situation. But I could see

plainly that John Kennedy had doubts, and was seeking

a way out.

That same evening I recounted this conversation in

detail to an American colleague - an intimate friend of

President Kennedy, through whom I had obtained this

interview -and to the editor of The New Republic.

Both my confidants, who knew the President a thou-

sand times better than I, agreed that John F. Kennedy

had never before expressed him so specifically and

with such feeling on his understanding of the first

phase of the Castro revolution. They hesitated to draw

any political conclusions from his remarks. However,

they were not surprised at Kennedy's invitation to

come and see him again when I returned from Cuba.

In effect, John Kennedy displayed two basic charac-

teristics in his exercise of power: first, an overwhelming

degree of empiricism and realism. A man without a

particular doctrine, he reacted decisively to events, and

only to events. Nothing but the shock of collision with

a problem was sufficient to make him come to a deci-

sion, and because of this, his decisions were unpredic-

table. At that point he had

a consuming need for

information, and this need had increased a great deal

since experience had taught him not to rely solely on

official channels.

After this, I went to Havana.

ors, writers and painters, militants and counter-revo-

lutionaries, ministers and ambassaubts- but Fidel re-

mained inaccessible. I had been warned: he was snowed

under with work; as a result of the hurricane, the

Cuban government had been obliged to revise its whole

planning program; and then, above all, he no longer

had any desire to receive any journalists, least of all

Yestern newsmen. I had practically given up. hope

when, on the evenine of what hauche wis to be my

leparture dais the capricious plane which link

Tisan with Mexica happily did not leave the next day

after all), Fidel came to my hotel. He had heard of my

interview with the President. We went up to my

room at to in the evening and did not leave until 4 in

the following morning. Here, I shall only recount that

part of that interview which constitutes a reply to John

E. Kennedy's remarks.

Fidel listened with devouring and passionate irter-

est: he pulled at his beard, yanked his parachutist's

beret down over his eyes, adjusted his maqui tunic, all

the while making me the target of a thousand malicio

sparks cast by his deep-sunk, lively eyes. At one point

I felt as though I were playing the role of that partner

with whom he had as strong a desire to confer as to do

battle; as though I myself were in a small way that

intimate enemy in the White House whom Khrushchev

described to Fidel as someone with whom "it is pos-

sible to talk." Three times he had me repeat certain re-

marks, particularly those in which Kennedy expressed

his criticism of the Batista regime, those in which Ken-

nedy showed his impatience with the comments attrib-

uted to General de Gaulle, and lastly those in which

Kennedy accused Fidel of having almost caused a war

fatal to all humanity.

When I stopped talking, I expected an explosion.

Instead, I was treated to a lengthy silence and, at the

end of that silence, to a calm, composed, often humor-

ous, always thoughtful exposition. I don't know wheth-

er Fidel has changed, or whether these cartoons cari-

caturing him as a ranting madman which appear in the

Western press perhaps correspond to a former reality.

I only know that at no time during the two complete

days I spent with him (and during which a great deal

happened), did Castro abandon his composure and

poise. Here too, I shall let Castro speak for himself,

reserving only the possibility of correcting certain judg-

ments on these two political leaders based on my own

experiences in Cuba.

"I believe Kennedy is sincere," Fidel declared. "I

also believe that today the expression of iris sincerity

could have political significance. I'll explain what I

chiavellian tactics and the equivocation, the attempts at

of a counter-icvolution, the blockade and, above ev "y-

thing, all the retaliatory massures which were imposed

hefore, lony before there was the uretert and alibi of

Communism. But I feel that he inherited a difficult

situation; I don't think a President of the United States

is ever really free, and ! believe Kennedy is at present:

feeling the impact of this lack of freedom. I also believe

he now understands the extent to which he has been

misled, especially, for example, on Cuban reaction at

the time of the attempted Bay of Pigs invasion. I also

think he is arcalist; he is now registering that it is im-

possible to simply wave a wand and cause us, and the

explosive situation throughout Latin America, to dis-

appear.

Why the Missiles Were Installed

"There is one point on which I want to give you new

information. right away. I have refrained from doing

this until now; but today an attempt is being made to

frighten all mankind by propagating the idea that

Cuba, and in particular I, might provoke a nuclear war,

so I feel the world should know the true story of the

missile emplacement.

"Six months before these missiles were installes in

Cuba, we had recoived an accumulation of information

waiting us that a new invasion of the island was being

prepared under sponsorshige the Central Intellicence

Agency, whose administrators were humiliated by the

Bay of Pigs disaster and by the spoctacle of being

ridiculed in the eyes of the world and beraled in US

government circles. We also knew that the Pentagon

was vesting the ClA preparations with the mantle of

its authority, but we had doubts as to the attitude of

the President. There were those among our informants

Who even thought it would suffice to alert the President

and give him cause for concern in order to arrest thesc

preparations. Then one day Khrushchev's son-in-law,

Adzhubei, came to pay us a visit before going on to

Washington at the invitation of Kennedy's associates.

had been received by the American Chief Excculive,

and their talk centered particularly on Cuba: A weck

after this interview, we received in Havana a copy of

Adzhubei's report to Khrushcher. It was this report

which triggered the whole situation.

•"What did Kennedy say to Adzhubei? Now listen to

this carefully, for it is very important: he had said that

- the now situation in Cuba was intolerable for the Unit-

med States, that the American government hud decide

it would not tolerate it any louser; he had said that

peaceful coexistence was seriously compromised by the

fact that 'Soviet influences' in Cuba altered the balance

of strength, was destroying the equilibrium greed

18

upon and fat this point Castro emphasized his state-

ment by pronouncing each stable separatelyl Ken-

nedy reminded the Russians that the United States

had not intervened in Hungary, which was obviously

a way of demanding Russian non-intervention in the

event of a possible invasion. To be sure, the actual word

draw the same conclusions as we did. But when we

communicated to Khrushchev all our previous informa--

tion, the Russians too began to interpret the Kennedy-

Adzhubei conversation as we saw it and they went to

the succo du formation. By is cadet month,

definite conviction that an invasion might take place

from one moment lo the next. This is the truth.

"What was lo be done? How could we prevent the

invasion? We found that Khrushchev was concerned

about the same things that were worrying us. He asked

is the same as in allack ou the Sawin Tion. And how

to realize this objective? All our thinking and discus-

sions revolved around this point. We thought of a

proclamation, an alliance, conventional military aid.

The Russians explained to us that their concern was

twofold: first, they wanted to save the Cuban revolu-

tion (in other words, their socialist honor in the cyes

of the world), and at the same time they wished to

avoid a world conflict. They reasoned that if conven-

tional military aid was the extent of their assistance,

the United States might not hesitate to instigate in

invasion, in which case Russia would retaliate and this

would inevitably touch off a world war."

At this point I interrupted to ask how Cub.: could

have been absolutely certain of Soviet intervention.

After all, I said, Stalin certainly "let down" Markos,

the Chief of the Greck Communist Resistance, because

such help would have conflicted with prevailing zones

of influence.

"I know," Castro replied, "but the two situations

cannot be compared." Then he continued:

"Russia was much too deeply committed to us. More-

over, since then we have had every proof of the im-

mense solidarity of the Soviet people and its leaders.

You can see for yourself how clearly this solidarity is

manifest here. Then there is. something else, specifi-

cally apropos of Stalin. When I was in the USSR and

others, outside Russia, were reproaching Khrushchev

for taking a more conciliatory standthan Stalin toward

the capitalists, Khrushchev confided to me several ex-

amples, which I will not repeat to you, illustrating the

prudence, even the abdication of Stalin. He told me -

and I believe him - that Stalin would never have em-

placed missiles in Cuba.

"It is true that it was said then by other factions

that. the real

reason for installing the missiles was

because certain internal problems were driving the Rus-

sians to use us to provoke the United States. I am here

to tell you that the Russians didn't want and do not

today want war. One only need visit them on their

home territory, watch thein at work, share their cro-.

nomic concerns, admire their intense efforts to raise the

workers' standard of living, to understand right away

that they are far, very far, from any idea of provocation

or domination. However, Soviet Russia was confronted

by two alternatives: an absolutely inevitable wai (bc-

cause of their commitments and their position in thic

socialist world), if the Cuban revolution was attacked:

or the risk of a war if the United States, refusing to

retreat before the missiles, would not give up the at-

tempt to destroy Cuba. They chose socialist solidarity

and the risk of war.

"Under these circumstances, how could we Cubans

have refused to share the risks taken to save us? It

was, in the final analysis, a question of honor, don't

militants. In a word, then, we agreed to the emplace-

ment of the missiles. And I might add here that for us

Cubans it didn't really make so much difference

whether we died by conventional bombing or a hydro-

gen bomb. Nevertheless, we were gambling with

the peace of the world. The United States was the one

to jeopardize the peace of mankind by using the threat

of. war to stifle revolutions.

"And so in June, loos, my brother Raoul and Che

Guevara went to Moscow to discuss ways and means

of installing the missiles. The convoy arrived by sea in

three weeks. The United States was able to find out

that weapons were being shipped in, of course; but it

took them tivo months to discover that these weapons

were guided missiles. Tiro months... in other words,

longer than we had calculated. Because, of course, we

were seeking intimidation, not aggression."

•Alliance for Progress

The conversation now turned to the Alliance for Prog-

ress. "In a way,". Castro said, "it was a good idea, it

marked progress of a sort. Even if it can be said that it

was overdue, timid, conceived on the spur of the

moment, under constraint. despile all that I am will

ing to agres that the idea inter constituted an effort.

to adapt to the extraordinarily rapid course of events in

Latin America. Such as, for example, what we read in

he papers this morning - did you see the news? That

Argentina is nationalizing the oil industry? The Argen-

tine government! Do you realize what that means? This

ill cause more commotion on the deir York stock

exchange than Castroism! The Catholic and military

concervatives of Argentina, the factions most closely

linked with American interests! There is talk of na-

tionalization of industries there, of agrarian reform

there... well and good! If the Alliance for Progress

provokes these developments, then it's not doing so

badly; all these things are consonant with the aspira-

tions of the people. I can look back to the days of

Eisenhower, or rather of Nixon, and recall the furore

which broke out when the United States and Cuba to-

gether decreed an agrarian reform which was to apply,

mark this well, only to landowners of over 200,000

hectares! Yes, 200,000! Yet the reaction of the trusts

was terrible al that time. Nowadays, in the other Latin

American countries, because the Communist banner is

used as a bogeyman, the reaction of the American

trusts is shrewder. They are going to choose strawmen,

so as to rule indirectly. But there will be difficulties.

"This is why Kennedy's good idcas aren't going to

vield any results. It is very casy to understand and at

this point he surely is aware of this because, as I told

you, he is a realist. For years and years American policy

- not the government, but the trusts and the Pentagon

- has supported the Latin American oligarchies. All the

prestige, the dollars, and the power was held by a class

which Kennedy himself has described in speaking of

Batista. Suddenly a President arrives on the scene who

tries to support the interests of another class (which

has no access to any of the levers of power) to give the

various Latin American countries the impression that

the United Sates no longer stands behind the dictators,

and so there is no more need. to start Castro-type revo-

lutions: What happens then? The trusts see that their

interests are being a little compromised (just barely,

• but still compromised); the Pentagon thinks the strate-

gie bases are in danger; the powertul oligarchies in all

the Latin American

countries alert their American

friends; they sabotage the new policy; and in short,

Kennedy has everyone against him. The fes liberal or

allegedly liberal presidents who were chosen as instru-

ments of the new policy are swept out of office, like

Bosch in Santo Domingo, or else they are transformed.

Belancourt, for example, was not a Balista; now he

has become one.

"In view of all these things, how can the American.

government seriously believe that Cuban subversion is

at the root of explosions taking place all over the

South American continent? In Venezuela, for, example,

are you familiar with the situation there? Do you think

the Venezuclans need us to understand what's going

on in their country? Do you think we don't have

enough problems of our own? Right now I ask only

one thing: Leave us in peace to better our country's

economic situation, to put our planning into effect, to

educate our young compañeres. This doesn't mean we

do not feel solidarity toward nations that are struggling

and suffering, like the V'enezuelan people. But it is up

to those nations to decide what they want, and if they

choose other regimes than ours, this isn't our business."

"We Have Alionys Lived with Daiger"

I asked Fidel where is this all going to end? How will

the situation develop? Even if the United States uses

against you what you call the alibi of Communism, it

still remains true that you have chosey Commonism,

that your economy and your security depend on the

Soviet Union, and that even if you have no ulterior mo-

tives in this association, still the United States considers

that you are part of an international strategy, that you

constitute a Soviet base in a world where peace depends

on mutual respect for a tacit division of zones of in-

"I don't want to discuss our ties with the Soviet

Union!" Fidel Castro cut me short. "I find this inderent.

We have none but feelings of fraternily and profound,

total gratitude toward the USSR. The Russians are

making extraordinary efforts on our behalf, efforts

which sometimes cost then dear. But we have our own

policies which are perhaps not always the same (we

have proved this!) as those of the USSR. I refuse to

dwell on this point, because asking me to say that I am

not a pawn on the Soviet ches tael is something like

asking a woman to shout aloud in the public square

that she is not a prostitute.

"If the United States, sees the problem as you have

posed it, then you are right, there is no way out. But

who is the loser in the last analysis? They have tried

everything against us, everything, absolutely every-

thing, and we are still alive and getting better day by

day; we are still standing upright, and we plan to celc-

brate with greater festivities than usual, on January 1,

1964, the fifth anniversary of the Cuban Revolution!

The United States'

policy of isolating us economically

is less effective with each passing day; we are increas-

ing our trade with the rest of the world. Even with'

Spain! We have just sold a shipment of 500,000 tons

of sugar to the Spaniards. Far from discouraging us,

the blockade is maintaining the revolutionary atmos-

phere we need to stiffen the country's backbone. Are we

in danger? We have always lived with danger. To say

nothing of the fact that you have no idea how many

friends one discovers in the world when one is porse-

cuter by the United Staba Nion truly, for all these

reasons, we are not suppliants, we ask nothing. I'll

tell you something else: since the rupture and the

blockade, we have forgotten the United States. We feel

neither hatred nor resentment any more, we simply

don't think about the US. When I think of the problems

20

which diplomatic relations with the United States

would porc! The Swiss Ambassador Wepresenting the

U's at present. I prefer to do business with him than

with 2o0 members of an Embassy among whom surely

some spies would be spotted.

"I have just talked to you as a Cuban revolutionary.

But I should also speak to you as a peace lover, and

from this viewpoint I believe the United States is too

important a country not to have an influence on world

peace. I cannot help hoping, therefore, that a leader

will come to the fore in North America (why not Ken-

nedy, there are things in his favor!), who will be willing

to brave unpopularity, fight the trusts, tell the truth

and, most important, let the various nations act as

they see fit. I ask nothing: neither dollars, nor assis:-

ance, nor diplomats, nor bankers, nor military men..

nothing but peace, and to be accepted as we are! We

are socialists, the United States is a capitalist nation,

the Latin American countries will choose what they

want. All the same, at a time when the United States

is selling wheat to the Russians, Canada is trading with

China, de Gaulle respects Ben Bella, why should it be

impossible to make the Americans understand that

socialis leads, not to hostility toward them, but to co-

existence? Why am I not Tito or Sekou Touré? Because

the Russians have never done us any injury such as

the Yugoslavians and the Guineans have complained

of in the past, and because the Americans have never

given us any of the benefits for which these to nations

congratulate themselves today.

"As to this matter of fearing

Soviet intentions in

Latin America through Cuba's subversive activitie:

this is just attributing to others one's own desire lu

• dominate. You said yourself just a little while ago tha:

the Russians have had enough of their Cuban involve-

ment. Economically this is obvious. This is why, speak-

ing from a military viewpoint, it is better not to force

nations id turn to the Russians for help. Really, it

scems to me that á man like Kennedy is capable of

seeing that it is not in the United States interest to

pursue a policy which can lead only to a stalemate. So

far as we are concerried, everything can be restored to

normalcy on the basis of mutual respect of sover-

eignly."

In conclusion, Fidel Castro said to me: "Since you

are going to see Kennedy again, be an emissary of

peace, despite everything. I want to make myself clear:

I don't want anything, I don't expect anything, and

as a revolutionary the present situation does not dis-

please me. But as a man and as a statesman, it is my

duty to indicate what the bases for understanding

could be."

All this was said two days before President Ken-

nedy's death.

The minutes of the June 18, 1964, meeting (dated June 22, 1964)

contained the following: | [OBTAIN COPY] (signed by Peter Jessup)

"A paper was discussed on alleged plans which involve

the underworld to assassinate certain Cuban leaders.

Mr. McCone was somewhat skeptical of the reported plots and

stated that he would like to go into the matter further.

Others, including Mr. Bundy, felt that the United States was

being put on notice and should do everything in its power to

ascertain promptly the veracity of the reports and then under-

take prevention.

It was decided that Mr. Bundy would call the

matter to the Attorney General's attention as a

matter of law

enforcement."

Mr. McCone's personal memorandum for the record on this

meeting (dated) June 18,

1964, contains substantially the same

information.

(OBTAIN COPY] It refers to a June 10, 1964, CIA

memorandum "reporting plans of Cuban exiles to assassinate

leading Cuban government leaders.

This memo apparently had

been sent to Special Group members and the Attorney General.

[OBTAIN COPYJ

McCone's memo contains the following:

"ACTION: Discuss with General Carter and Mr. Helms steps we

should take

to establish the credibility. of the report; also

communicate with the FBI through Mr. Papich. Also I should

call the Attorney General personally."

The official minutes of the July 30, 1964, 303 Committee

meeting (dated July 31, 1964) (referred to in 1967 IG report)

contain no

When Castro Heard the News

TABN

It was around liza in the afternoon, Cuban time.

We

were hoing lunch in the living room of the modest

summer residence which Fidel Castro owns on magni-

ficent Varadero Beach, 12o kilonicters from Havana.

For at least the tenth time, i was questioning the Cuban

icader on details of the negotiations with Russia before

the missile installations last year. The telephone rang,

a secretary in guerrilla garb announced that Mr. Dor-

both the American contingets inchieve this goat, a -

leader would have to arise in the United States capable

of understanding the explosive realities of Latin Amer-

ica

and of mecting them halfway. Then, suddenly, he

had taken a less hostile tack: "Kennedy could still be

this man. He still has the possibility of becoming,

in the eyes of history, the greatest President of the

United States, the leader who may at last understand

that there can be coexistence between capitalists and

socialists, even in the Americas. He would then be

an even greater President than Lincoln. I know, for

"What's that? An attempted assassination?") He then

turnes to us to say that Kennedy had just been struck

lown in Dallas. Then he went back to the telephone

ind exclaimed in a loud voice "Merido? Muy grave-

"icnie"" ("Wounded? Very seriously?")

He came back, sat down, and repeated three times

he words: "Es una male noticin" ("This is bad news.")

He remained silent for a moment, awaiting another call

with further news. He remarked while we waited that

tere was an alarmingly sizable lunatic fringe in Amer-

can society and that this deed could equally well have

he work of a madman or of a terrorist. Perhaps a

Victnamese? Or a member of the Ku Klux Klan? The

econd call came through: it was hoped they would be

abie to announce that the United States President was

ill alive, that there was hope of saving him. Fidel

Castro's immediate reaction was: "If they can, he is

ready re-clected." He pronounced these words with

satisfaction.

This sentence was a sequel to a conversation we had

eld on a previous evening and which had turned into

in all-night session. To be precise, it lasted from 1o in

he evening until 4 in the morning. A good part jof

the talk revolved about the impressions I recounted

to him of an interview which President Kennedy

granted me this last October 24, and about Fidel

Castro's reactions to these impressions. During this

nocturnal discussion, Castro had delivered himself lof

• relentless indictment of US policy, adding that in the

recent past Washington had had ample opportunity

lo normalize its relations with Cuba, but that instead

it had tolcrated a CIA program of training, equipping

nd organizing a counter-revolution. He had told m

nat he wasn't in the least fearful of his life, sinc

danger was his natural milieu, and it he were to become

, virtim of the United;States this would simply en-

1a.

his radius of influence in Latin America as well

as throughout the socialist world. He was speaking, he

said, from the viewpolat of the interests of peace jin

example, that for Khrushchev, Kennedy is a man you

can talk with. I have gotten this impression from all

my conversations with Khrushchev. Other leaders have

assured me that to attain this goal, we must first await

his re-election. Personally, I consider him responsible

for everything, but I will say this: he has come to

understand many things over the past few. months;

and then.too, in the last analysis, I'm convinced that

anyone else would be woise.

Then Fidel had added

with a broad and boyish grin: "If you see him again,

you can tell him that l'mizelling to declare Goldwater

my friend if that will guarantee Kennedy's re-election!"

This conversation was heid on November 10.

Now it was nearly a o'clock and we got up from.

the table and settled ourselves in front of a radio.

Commandant Vallero, his physiclan, aide-de-camp, and

intimate friend, was easily able to get the broadcasts

from the NBC network in Miami. As the news came

in, Vallero would translate it for. Fidel: Kennedy

wounded in the head; pursuit of the assassin; murder

of a policeman; finally the fatal announcement: Presi-

change. The United States occupies such a position in

world affairs that the death of a President of that

country affects millions of people in every corner of

the globe. The cold war, relations with Russia, Latin

America, Cuba, the Negro question... all will have to

be rethought. I'll tell you one thing: at least Kennedy

was an chemy to whom we had become accustomed.

This is a serious matter, an extremely serious matter."

After the quarter-hour of silence observed by all

the American radio stations, we once more tuned in

on Miami; the silence had only been broken by a re-

broadcasting of the American national anthem. Strange

indeed was the impression made, on hearing this hymn

ring out in the house of Fidel Castro, in the midst of a

circl. of worried faces. "Now," Fidel said, "they will

ha: to find the assassin quickly, but very quickly,

otherwise, you watch and see, I know them, they wir

try to put the blame on us for this thing. but tell I

how many Presidents have been assassinated? Fosi

This is most disturbing! In Cuba, only one has been

assassinated. You know, when ive were hiding out is

the Sierra there were some (not ill my sroup, in an.

other) who wanted to kill Batista. They thought they

could do away with a regime by decapitating it. I have

always been violently opposed to such methods. First

of all from the viewpoint of political self-interest, be-

cause so far as Cuba is concerned, it Batista had been

killed he would have been replaced by some military

figure who would have tried to make the revolutionists

pay for the martyrdom of the dictator. But I was also

opposed to it on personal grounds; assassination is

repellent to me."

The broadcasts were now resumed. One reporter

felt he should mention the difficulty Mrs. Kennedy

was having in getting rid of her bloodstained stockings.

Fidel exploded: "What sort of a mind isi this!" He re-

peated the remark

several times: "What sort of a

mind is this? There is a difference in our civilizations

after all. Are you like this in Europe? For us Latin

Americans, death is a sacred matter; not only does it

mark the close of hostilities, but it also imposes de-

cency, dignity, respect. There are even istreet urchins

who behave like kings in the lace of death. Incidentally,

this reminds me of something else: if you write all

those things I told you yamalay against Kennedy's

policy, don't use his name now; speak instead of the

policy of the United States government."

Toward 5 o'clock, Fidel Castro declared that since

there was nothing we could do to alter the tragedy, we

must try to put our time lo good use in spite of it. He

wanted to accompany me in person

on a visit to a

granja de pucblo (state farm), where he had been en-

gaging in some experiments. His present obsession is

agriculture. He reads nothing but agronomical studies

and reports. He dwells lyrically on the soil, fertilizers,

and the possibilities which will give Cuba, enough

sugar cane by 1970 to achieve. economic independence.

"Didn't I. Tell You"

We went by car, with the radio on. The Dallas

police were now hot on the trail of the assassin. He

is a Russian spy, says the news commentator.. Five

minutes later, correction: he is. a spy married to a

Russian. Fidel said: "There, didn't I tell you; it'll be

maturn next." Buin jad. The next word was: the

assassin is a Marxist deserter. Then the word

through, in effect, that the assassin was a young man

who was a member of the "Fair Play for Cuba Com-

mittee," that he was an admirer of Fidel Castro. Fidel

declared: "If they had had proof, they would have said

8

he was an agent, an accomplice, a hired killer. In

saying simply that he is an admiss, this is just to try

and make an association in people's minds betwach ihe

name of Castro and the cmotion awakened by the

assassination. This is a publicity method, a propaganda

device. It's terrible. But you know, I'm sure this will

all soon blow over. There are too many competing

policies in the United States for any single one to be

able to impose itself universally for very long."

We arrived at the granja de preblo, where the farm-

ers welcomed Fidel. At that very moment, a speaker

announced over the radio that it was now known that

the assassin is a "pro-Castro Marxist." One commen-

tator followed another; the remarks became increas-

ingly emotional, increasingly aggressive. Fidel then

excused himself: "We shall have to give up the visit

had questions: "Who is Lyndon Johnson? What is his

reputation? What were his relations with Kennedy?

With Khrushchev? What was his position at the time of

the attempted invasion of Cuba?" Finally and most

important of all: "What authority does he exercise

over the CIA?" Then abruptly he looked at his watch,

saw that it would be half an hour before we reached

Matanzas and, practically on the spot, he dropped off to

slecp.

After Matanzas, where he must have decreed a state

of alert, se returned to Varadero for dinner. Quoting

the words spoken to him by a woman shortly before,

he said to me that it was an irony of history for the

Cubans, in the situation to which they had been re-

duced by the blockade, to have to mourn the death of

a President of the United States. "After all," he added

"there are perhaps some people in the world to whom

this news is cause for rejoicing. The South Vietnamese

guerrillas, for

example, and also, I would imagine,

Madame Nhu!"

I thought of the people of Cuba, accustomed to the

sight of posters like the ore depicting the Red Army

with maquis superimposed in front, and the screaming

captions * HALT, MR. KENNEDY! CUBA IS NOT ALONE..:

I thought of all those who had been led to associate

their deprivations with the policies of President John

F. Kennedy.

At dinner I was able to take up all my questions.

What had motivated Castro to endanger the peace of

the world with the missiles in Cuba? How dependent

was Cuba on the Soviet Union? Is it not possible to

envisage relations between Cuba andthe United States

along the same lines as those between Finland and the

Russians? How was the transition made from the

humanism of Sierra Maestra to the Marxism-Leninism

of 1061? Fidel Castro, once more in top form, had an

explanation for everything. Then he questioned me

once more on Kennedy, and each time I culogized lie

intellectual qualities of the assassinated President, 1

awakened the keenest interest in him.

The Cubans have lived with the United States in

that cruel intimacy so familiar to me of the colonized

with their colonizers. Nevertheless, it was an intimacy.

In that very sedative city of Havana to snich we re-

turned in the evening, where the luminous signboards

with Marxist slogans have replaced the Coca Coln and

toothpaste billboards, in the midst of Sovict exhibits

and Czechoslovakian trucks, a certain American emo-

tion vibrated in the almosphere, compounded of re-

sentment, of concern, of anxiety, yet also, in spite of

everything, of a mysterious almost imperceptible rap-

prochement. After all, this American President was able

lo reach accord with our Russian friends during his

ifetime, said a young Clean meilectual to me as i vas

taking my leave. It was almost as though he wore apolo-

gizing for not rejoicing at the assassination.

JEAN DANIEL

By Saturday night, even the television seemed worn

out by attempt and failure and ceased to comment and

gave over to a succession of photographs of the col-

imns and the windows and the corners of the White

House and of the shadows of the great Lincoln head

in Springfield and to a voice reciting "Oh, Captain,

My Captain." It is to be, then, the grand style. But the

ship has not weathered every storm; Mr. Kennedy is

not Abrahm Lincoln; not because he is more or less,

but because he is a remembered physical presence and

Mr. Lincoln an image of the plastic arts. One's own

time is personal, not historical. Just how long will it be

before many of us will want to read a book about the

day Mr. Kennedy was shot?

The news of tlie President's assassination was given

by a taxi driver to three gentlemen as they left a hotel

on Arlington Street in

Boston: They turned right

around and hurried back inside to allend to their in-

vestments. Packed with students in businessmen a

shuttle plane from Boston to Washington waited for

permission to take off when the captainicame. on the

intercom: "Folks, up here on the flight deck we've been

listening to the news and the President is dead." There

was only time to hear one woman say,

"How dread-

ful" before three men went back to discussing plan

specifications. A college student reading denmemnon

the money and started to serve drinks. Then the cap-

tain was back againsthey had been listening to more

neivs, that is trying to listen to news because their

real job was to hear flight control. There had been a

gun battle in Dallas; a patrolman was killed; the police

had taken a man in Tearie theater. Vice President

Johnson was now the President. The talk of business

went on through this, and stopped only when the cap-

tain again interrupted to say that the new President had

been sworn in aboard an aircraft. A few laughed.

They ask too much of us when they ask us to act up

to the grand style. We are not an emotionally affluent

people. Ant yet some of us always complained that

Mr. Kennedy did not seem quite emotionally commit-

ted enough. But now someone remembered with special

alfection a moment late in the 100o campaign. Mr.

Kennedy was in a motorcade and the Democratic gov-

ernor itho was with him said how wonderful it was to

feel the love with which these crowds pressed forward

to feel the touch of their candidate. "Öh, dry up," Mr..

Kennedy said. It seemed now somehow a special grace

respect for the grand style to counterfeit it; how much

truer to him might we have been if we had come down

in scale and if the many of us who must have remem-

bered the lines from Cymbeline had thought them

proper to speak

Just as Secret Service men reacted instinctively, rushing to protect the

presidential party, reporters reacted instinctively to get the news-sketchy

as it was at first-to the world. United Press International's Merriman

Smith, dean of the White House correspondents, describes on pages 32-33

his frantic rush to call the Dallas UPI bureau. Reproduced here is the result

of Smith's first efforts-the actual Teletype copy that almost immediately

clacked out of hundreds of UPI machines in newsrooms, radio and

television stations, pressrooms, and business offices all over the world.

The Dallas bureau, alerted by

Smith over radiotelephone from

toward the hospital, sends out

the first sparse news.

Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach telephoned at 10:50 a.m.

He said he had just completed talking on the telephone with Alexis Johnson,

Deputy Under Secretary of State. Johnson told Katzenbach that insofar as

the investigation of this matter in Mexico is concerned, the State Department

felt this should be coordinated and directed by the FBI. State took the

position that the President's directive to the FBI extended to any activity

outside of the United States, as well as within the country. Insofar as the

Ambassador in Mexico is concerned, Johnson believed he should be kept

informed of any pertinent developments but that the Ambassador should not

be running the investigation.

• As to current developments, Katzenbach said that the last thing

he would want would be for the FBI to take Agents away from their investiga-

tive duties to prepare reports. He requested, however, that if there were

any pertinent developments he be orally briefed

"one son se pite continue'

With further reference to his conversation with Alexis Johnson,

Katzenbach said he had been asked whether the State Department should make

a formal inquiry of the Soviet Government for information concerning Oswaid

and his wife, particularly as to their activities in Russia. He asked that this:1

question be considered by the Director, as Katzenbach feit his views most

important.

In thinking about the matter himself, Katzenbach noted if we

did not ask the Soviets for information there would 'be no answer should the

question of Oswald's stay in Russia be raised, other than to admit we had

made no inquiry. On the other hand, he observed that we could not place

any reliance on anything the Soviets said.

Sinc

atenioraudum to Mr. Belmont!

following recommendations are submitted with reference to the points

raised by Mr. Katzenbach:

1. Insofar as making a formal approach to the Soviet Government,

we believe this undesirable. Such a formal request from the United States

will enable the Russians to put out an official statement entirely favorable

to them. The United States will have to acopet this, since it is in response

to our formal request, and we won't be in a position to disprove it. The

State Department has responsibility here and we should not dictate the

position they are to take, but our views should be stated.

2.

In connection with the investigation in Mexico, it is

recommended Katzenbach be informed that the State Department and

Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) have jurisdiction in dealing with foreign

governments and in getting investigative results and intelligence coverage

abroad; that while we are cooperating fully with State and CIA in Mexico,

the responsibility in this matter should rest with State and CIA.

I approved, Katzenbach will be so advised.

Dear Mr. Heacock:

Fille Church, L'a, 22843

Tel, (1001) 534-3975

Thank you for writing

to me regarding your knowledge of

the activities of the Central Intelligence Agency.

I understand

that you have discussed these questions at length with members

of the Committee

staff.

On March 1 the Committee reported S. Res. 400 creating

a Senate Committee on Intelligence Activities.

The legislation

which was before us concerned only the establishment of

a new

congressional committee; it did not involve revisions that would

significantly modify the structure of the powers of the CIA it-

self.

The Committee has not been authorized to hire additional

staff personnel for the purpose of this legislation. Further-

we were under instructions from the Senate to report out a.

formal recommendation in the form of legislation by March 1.

I am, however, deeply concerned with the charges you

have made because, it

true,. they represent grave examples of

corruption and criminality.

It is

my hope and intent that the

new committee created by the legislation we are considering,

once it is established, will have the jurisdiction and the re-

sources to explore the

kind of issues which you raise.

I assure you that the entirety of the information you

have submitted to my committee will be made available to the

new Congressional oversight committee.

I am sure you understand the constraints on the Govern-

ment Operations

Committee which prevent us from

undertaking the

investigations you suggest, but I shall forward the material

you submitted to the new committee as soon as it is established.

For your information, I

am enclosing a copy of S. Res.

400 and a copy of the committee's report on this measure.

Sincerely,

Sile itin

Antonio BLANCO Pico, former chief of SIM killed on 28 October 1956 at the Mont-

martre nightclub. On 29 lovember 1955 SIM agents interrogated Dr. Armando CaNOENAS

admission from CaRdchAs that duan Pedro CeRso servia ano

USELES Secades had sought refuce at his house after the assassination of Elico

Rico and had remained there approximately three or four days.

CARDERAS stated

during interrogation that CARSO had

arrived at his house carrying a sub-rachine

gun.

On the basis of CARDElAS admissions, SiM officiais are convinced that

CARBO and CUBELAS viere the ones who killed ELiNCO Rico.

2. Implication of CARDENAS and CUBELAS resulted from the interception of a cable

by SIM sent from Miami, Florida, by a friend of CUBELAS to Virginia sEcades,

mother of CUBELAS, in Mabana.

On: 27 November 1956 Virginia SECADES was arrested

by SIM and taken to SIM headquarters for questioning concerning her son's parti-

cipation in the assassination of BLANCO Rico. SIM agents were unable to obtain

any information from SECADES concerning her son's role in the killing but suc-

ceeded in learning that CARDENAS was a close friend of her son.

On 29 lovember

1956 SIM agents picked up CARDENAS, who, under pressure, admitted that he was

a homosexual, that CUSELAS was his intimate friend, and that he had nidden

CUBELAS and CARBO in his home for about four days.

These admissions were made

at SIM headquarters in the presence of Colonel Irenaldo GARCIA Baez, deputy

chief of SIM, Lt. Col. Marcelo TASERNILLA, ho was wounded during the shooting

Of BLANCO Rico, and other high SIM officials.

4. SIM has transmitted the results of interrogation of SECADES and CARDEÑAS tO

President Fulgencio BATISTA, but the latter's reaction to these new develop-

ments is not known. Further action by the Cuban-authorities is complicated

by the fact that the Government's main witness, CAPPENAS, is of dubious re-

liability, because of his homosexuality. CARDENAS is also reported to be

the doctor of the family of Santiaço VEPDEJA Neyra, Minister of Defense, who

vouched for him when he was arrested by siM.

Field Carments:

1. Office files contain no previous record of CARDENAS in connection with

anti-BATISTA activities. A Dr. Armando CARDEMAS was listed in Hor (defunct

newspaper of the Cuban Co-sunist Party), issue of 22 April 1969, as one

of the persons who sent greetings to the Horld Corgress of Peace Partisans,

scheduled to begin in Paris on 20 April 1949.

2.

Both CARSO and CUBELAS have been the subjects in the past of denunctations

and arrests by the Cuban authorities as a result of their anti-BATISTa

activities.

•They were accused in August 1955 by Colonel Orlando PIEDRA,

chief of the Department of Investigations, of having fled from the police

from the site of an ams cache.

In February 1956 CUBELAS was arrested and

tried on charges of participating in student disorders, according to articles

which appeared in local newspapers on 15 March 1955 and 1 April 1956.

CARBO

was denounced by the Cuban police as one of BLANCO Rico's killers immediately

after the shooting incident at the Montmartre nightclub.

3.

office files contain no previous record of Virginia SECADES, Habana news-

papers of 29 November 1956 carried an item in which the University of Habana

Student Federation protested against the detention of Virginia SECADES by

SIM.

4. Files of the Consular Section, United States Embassy, Habana, revealed

that CARBO was issued a tourist visa on 3 June 1951 and that CUBELAS re

ceived a similar visa on 15 October 1954. The files do not indicate

whether these visas were valid for a single entry or multiple entries, but

they could still be valid, on the basis of the dates of issue.

possible that CARDENAS may have been forced by siM interrogators to make

statements implicating CARBO and CUBELAS which were not altogether true.

6.

The local press and radio reported on 29 and 30 Movember 1956 that United

States authorities were looking in lew Orleans for two Cubans who were sus-

pected of being the killers of BLANCO Pico.

They were identified by name as

Rolando CUSELAS Secades and Guillermo GARCIA Riestra.

The latter, wile a

student at the University of Habana, was accused of having participated in

an attempt against the life of Rolando MASFERRER in September 1949, accord-

ing to office files.

2.

Re question number 3(a) of reference: For your background,

•the Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil (DRE) was a Cuban

exile entity founded in September 1960 as an anti-Communist revolutionary

organization dedicated to the overthrow of the Castro regime!

organization of the DRE was the Directorio Revolucionario (DR), a revolu

tionary organization of Cuban students opposed to the Batista regime

which actively joined the Castro forces by organizing a guerrilla move-

ment which contributed greatly to the collapse of the Batista regime.

The Castro government, themselves of student origin, recognized the DR

power and by-passed them politically by forming the new regime without

their participation. The original DR became Communist controlled and

directed. While the Agency had no role in the founding, the DRE was an

entity used by the CIA as a unilateral asset in pursuing U.S. policy

objectives. CIA support to the DRE ceased on 30 September 1966 and formally

terminated on 1 January 1967. At that time DRE files were reviewed and

material dealing with CIA support and operations were either destroyed

or turned over the JMWAVE Station.

The DRE was expected to continue as

an organizational entity and continue its activities independent of CIA.

The DRE files of both Station INWAVE and Headquarters that are

available have been reviewed and Lee Harvey Oswald's name does not appear

in these files.

WAVE cable 8049 (in 66782) of 22 November 1963, states

in the third sentence, "according AMSPELL files, Oswald", undoubtedly

refers to the DRE files maintained in the DRE office in Miami, Florida.

4. Re question number 3(b) of reference: We have been unable to

determine if Station JIWAVE was instructed to review its files for

Information on Oswald. For. many years the CI Staff has been the focal

point for the collation of any and all information concerning Oswald

and if the J'WAVE files on any Cuban groups contained information on

Oswald

such information should be reflected in Oswald 201 file.

SUBJ:

CIA Briefing with Raymond Rocca Regarding Oswald

Early in our investigation of CIA's handling of the Oswald case,

Raymond

Rocca briefed Wallach, Dwyer and Greissing on November 11 and

13, 1975.

Some of Rocco's comments merit consideration in light of

our present knowledge of the case.

1.

Opening of 201

Rocca explained that Oswald's 201 was opened by Betty Egerter::

from a list of American defectors 1958-1960 from the State Department.

2.

Status of 201, 11/22/63

Rocca explained that on November 22, 1963 all documents in the

Oswald 201 were originated by other agencies; Mexico City cable

Traffic was not included in the 201 because it was routed through

a compartmentalized channel and therefore would not be circulated

via the 201.

3.

Oswald's Defection to' USSR

With regard to Oswald's defection to the Soviet Union, Rocca

said Oswald would have been of interest to the military and the FBI

and that CIA was only interested in the "'information"'

aspect of the

case.

Rocca could not cite any, example of a U.S. citizen defecting

on behalf of any interest of the U.S. government.

Jith regard to the "Hoover" memorandum of June 3

the possibility that an imposter could be using Oswald's birth certifi-

cate, Rocca believed Hoover would not have generated it.

Rocca sug™

gested someone at the Bureau who was familiar with soviet technique

of using birth certificates for illegals -- Larry McWilliams, Brannigan

or Cregar - would have authored the memo. (Rocca could never establish

if, in fact, Oswald took his birth certificate with him to the Soviet

Union.)

• Rocca commented that the Bureau memo, sent to State and ONI,

should have been forwarded to CIA by State, but never was.

In Rocca's determination, Oswald was the only American defector

who was allowed to stay in Russia following a suicide attempt.

' Rocca

said that Oswald would have been subjected to one or two assessments

by the KGB.

Rocca referred to an SB study, directed by Lee Wigren and con-

ducted by Virginia Valpi which compared the Oswald case to other U.S.

defectors and their wives.

SB concluded Oswald was not given special

handling by the KGB. Rocca maintains Oswald was given special treat-

which Oswald received financial assistance) and the Red Cross' relation-

He believes Oswald's relationship with the

"Red Cross"

ship with the KGB should be clarified.

Rocca also finds it peculiar that Marina married Oswald since

Marina's uncle was KGB.

Rocca said that Oswald was the only defector

who married someone with a KGB connection of that kind.

Rocca said that

the CIA developed this information after the assassination.

Rocca described Minsk as "not an unsensitive section" of Russia

and added that Oswald was the only American defector in Minsk, a white

Russian area.

Rocca commented on Oswald's surprise

bassy in Moscow by saying.

in Russia!"'

Rocca believes Oswald's Soviet diary is bona fide. Rocca ad-

mitted that although there are perceptible changes in the quality

of Oswald's written material, Oswalds'

mentality seemed conducive

to periods of attention to thoroughness and detail.

4. Alleged Debriefing of Oswald

Rocca did not have any knowledge of an alleged debriefing of

Oswald in New York City by the DCD.

Rocca said that if a debriefing

report existed; it would have been distributed in 00 series (overt

operations) of the DDI (now DDO) .

Rocca also noted that a debriefing

report would not have been filed in the Oswald 201. Rocca noted that

a Dr. Froyn (phonetic) supervised DDI records.

Rocca also said that

Traveler's Aid was a legitimate charitable organization which had no

ties with the CIA.

5.

Oswald and Mexico City

Rocca said that Chief, WH could clarify aspects of technical

operations

on Cuban and Soviet Embassies.

Rocca said that David

Phillips organized the technical surveillance.

Although the Cuban Embassy was officially closed on September

Rocca found nothing unusual about Oswald's visit there and meeting

Silvi Duran, Cuban consulate employee.

Rocca emphasized that Oswald's activities in Mexico City were

the responsibility of the FBI.

6. Possible Oswald-Cuban Connections

Rocca described document gaps in the materials that the Russian

and Cuban governments forwarded to the WC via diplomatic channels.

He described these areas as "open and relevant."

Rocca drew attention to Oswald's Marine duty in California in

1958. Basing most of his analysis on

testimony of

DelGado, Oswald's

sergeant in California, Rocca maintained that Oswald had made contact

with the Cubans at the

Cuban Embassy in Los Angeles.

Rocca said that

DelGado had to release Oswald. from guard duty because someone from Los

Angeles reinitiated contact while Oswald was on duty.

Rocca placed specific emphasis on Castro's"impromptu "comments

to Harker at the Brazilian Embassy in Havana

Rocca viewed Castro's comments as a "message"on September 7, 1963.

to American leaders

and said it was a "very important signpost,"

Rocca added that the

Mexico City Station brought Castro's comments to Headquarter's atten-

tion on 11/25/63.

Rocca also viewed Castro's comments in terms of

Oswald's possible perception of

them, since New Orleans Times Picayune

ran the Harker atticle on September

9, 1963. (This is the Tine Slawson

adopted: could Oswald have read the piece?)

•In regard to the Castro comments (unfortunately my notes are

sketchy here)

Rocca refers to a 10/24/63 cable, memo, or letter from,

"Des to Paris.". He then refers to an 11/5/63 memo for the record and

said "man never heard from again."

Rocca should be asked

to clarity

these references.

Rocca briefly outlined Cuban-Russian relations in the early 1960s.

he described 196l as the

"seed time" between Cuba and the USSR.

Rocca

said that following the missile crisis, the KGB and DGI began a "pre-

liminary relationship."

Rocca mentioned Srotoff (phonetic) and

Alexiev (sic) as being KGB principals involved. Rocca said that when

Castro visited Moscow in June-July 1963, Alexiev and Leonoff served

as liaison between Kruschev and Castro.

Rocca referred to an escalation

of Alpha-66 activity (sporadic revolutionary attacks on Cuban ports

vessels, etc.) in July-August 1963.

Rocca places Castro's "warning"

of September 7, 1963 in the context of these activities.

Rocca said that Oswald's

activities for the FPCC in New Orleans

were apparently self-motivated.

Rocca added, however, that V. T. Lee,

national chairman of the FPCC,

visited Cuba in 1964.

Rocca noted that

(fnu) Hernandez handled Lee's

case and that Hernandez' office was next

to Azcue's, who, according to Duran, argued with Oswald at the Cuban

Embassy in

Mexico City.

According to Rocca, Hernandez was mentioned

in penetration reports

from Guatemala where

Hernandez was running two

DG1 agents.

Rocca outlined these relationships briefly to demonstrate

DGI-FPCC connections.

Rocca concluded that the Warren Commission should

have paid more attention to the DGI. Rocca also mentioned that the

who

was handled by WH Division.

7.

Oswald, New Orleans, Garrison Case

Rocca said that the CI/R and A stayed on top of

the Garrison case

and "summarized overt developments."

Rocca identified the analyst

for the Garrison material as Donald Pratt. Rocca said that by NSA

intercepts and associated relationships,

the CIA believed Garrison

was operating (unwittingly) under KGB manipulation.

(Rocca briefly

described Soviet technique of misinformation. He recalled an inter-

view that Drew Pearson had with

Kruschev in

Cairo in 1964 or 1965.

Kruschev told Pearson that his "'gut feeling" was that American right-

wing extremists and capitalists

were responsible for theresident'

assassination. Rocca said this typified KGB disinformation.)

Rocca characterized Oreste Pena's allegations as "absolute

fabrication." Rocca said CIA files revealed that Clay Shaw was a

contact of the DCD until 1956.

Rocca said that he was never informed in 1962 or 1963 about

a revolutionary training camp around Lake Pontchartrain.

He believes

that the GIA did not know of its existence.

Rocca said there is evi-

dence that messages

from the Lake Pontchartrain camp were going to a

drop in Mexico City.

8.

GP FLOOR Period

GPFLOOR was the crypt used to describe the investigation con-

ducted by CIA following the President's assassination (11/23-1/12-15/63.)

The Mexico City aspect of GPFLOOR was controlled by WH: J. C. King,

Chief; Jack Whiten, Desk Chief, and Win Scott, COS, Mexico

City. Rocca

said that Whiten would report Mexico City developments to Helms who

would then inform McCone.

9. End of GPFLOOR: Warren Commission

With the formation of the Warren Commission, the GPFLOOR period

ended. Rocca explained that Helms served as the major liaison between

the CIA and WC.

Rocca served as chief of research for matters of in-

terest to the WC -- mostly concerning Oswald's defection to Russia.

Rocca's staff included: Thomas Hall, Arthur Dooley and Paul Hartman.

Hall conducted research on Soviet service in DDO.

Dooley followed all

Bureau developments forwarded to CIA.

Hartman was responsible for ex-

ploration of overt references and Soviet service."

Additionally,. Hartman

researched DeMohrenschildt's relationship to the Oswalds.

Rocca reported his research staff's findings to Angleton; Rocca

had no contact with Helms.

Rocca explained that he had some liaison

with Slawson of the WC staff.

Rocca said that any negotiation between

the CIA and WC was conducted by Helms,

Dulles, and Rankin

Rocca said

he had no knowledge of any CIA assassination attempts against castro.

Rocca emphasized that the FBI

was the investigative arm for the

Warren Commission.

Rocca said that Sam Fapich, Dick O'Niell (sic) and

Jim Hunt were the Bureau personnel involved with the WC.

is magis

Rocca said that additional research in CI was conducted by

David Murphy and Bagley, Chief and Deputy Chief of CI/SB.

Rocca

said that Lee Wigren and Virginia Valpi were also involved ir

Soviet R&A.

10.

Rockefeller Commission Inguiry

Rocca served as CIA liaison to the Rockefeller Commission

in regard to Warren Commission allegations.

Belin and Robert Olsen

were involved in the investigation.

Belin wanted Rocca to review

documentation regarding the photo of the unidentified individual

in Mexico City.

Belin told Rocca that the Warren Commission was not

clued in on Cuban emigreeissues

and Operation MONGOOSE. Rocca de-

veloped the impression that the Rockefeller Commission

was looking

into CIA's operations aimed at Castro.

Belin asked Rocca for the

Castro comments of September 7, 1963. Belin was not aware of the

statements during the Warren Commission. (Slawson, however, was but

only at the conclusion of the WC.).

Rocca also

said that Belin is writing another book on Oswald

and the President's assassination.

I then got a call from Bundy on October 2nd, and he said

that -- Chasa, I think his name was.

Peter Chase, one of his

assistants -- is the person to be in touch with, and to keep

him apprised of all developments.

I later again got a word from Jean Daniel, the French:

correspondent who had come back from Havanna saying Cuba seemed

ripe for a conversation.

So this also came from anothar source,

a Greek town planner named "Doxiati;,: who said that Castro was

very much interested in some kind of normalization relation,

but that Che Guevera and Raul were opposed.

October 21st, I got a call again from Bundy's office asking

me what was new. I said, well the ball is now, in the Cuban's

court.

On the 28th, I saw Lochuga again at the UN who said that

Havanna didn't see exactly how a talk would be useful now, but

he would be glad to maintain continuous contact with me anyway.

The 4th of November I brisfed Stevenson on these develop:

ments and meanwhile, Miss Howard had been on the phone with

Rene Valao who was Fidel Castro's aide at that point, and who

was one of the so-called pro-Americans in the group and who

suggested that I get in touch with him by telephone.

I then briefed Bundy on this: on the 5th of November

Bundy told me that the President was more in favor of pushing

towards an opening toward Cuba than was the State Department,

the idea being -- well, getting them out of the soviet fold and

perhaps wiping out the Bay of Pigs and maybe getting back into

Chase then said. Bundy wanted a chronological memo about

the entire thing. I might say I have forgotten one point. When

I first told Adlai Stevenson about this demarche :or approach

by the Cubans he said he liked it, but, and I quote, he said

the CIA, unfortunately, is still in charge of Cuba. But he

said -- he still offered to take it up with the White House.

Anyway, we're now on November 12th, and I went to Miss

Howard's apartment where she said he had set up a phone call to

Havanna with Valao. We never could get through. the bad

connections, but she had spoken to him before I arrived and

he had suggested that I come to Marianao from Key West and

talk directly with Fidel Castro, because they wanted to avoid

going through Havanna.

Bundy called me the same day to say that the White House

favored preliminary talks with Valao at the UN but not down in

Cuba and told me to tell Valao this. I finally reached Valao

on the telephone on November the 14th and delivered a message

about his. coming here. He said -- and that

we wanted to discuss

He said he would send instructions to LaChuga and that he

would - or rather Castro, through him, to LaChuga, that they

should discuss an agenda with me. He was very cordial on the

telephone.

we referred to our talk in

'59. and he said another talk might

be possible and useful at this time, and that was the first real

indication. At this point, I said I'm no longer a private

citizen but a government official and we agreed that the

current situation was different, at the same time, things were

a bit abnormal and he said the Cubans were very much annoyed at

the exile rate, the CIA rate on Cuba, as well as the freezing

of their assets.

The next step was my visit to Washington on September 24th

when I came down to see Robert Kennedy who was then Attorney

General. His position was -- I showed him the memoranda, which

I had prepared on what had happened up to that point. He said

that a trip to Cuba which is what LaChuga had suggested would

be rather risky, said it was bound to leak and said it might

result in some kind of Congressional investigation or something.

Anyway, it might be a problem. But he did think the matter was

worth pursuing through UN. channels, and he would be talking to

Averell Harriman and Bundy about it.

At that point, LaChuga said he would be making a very

violently anti-American speech on November 7th and not to worry

too much about it, so Stevenson asked me to help prepare a speech

in raply. On the 27th of Septembar, I saw Lochuga again, told him

I could not aecept any invitation to come to Cuba, but I would

be glad to keep in touch with him and he could talk with

anyone who wanted to come up and he said he would notify Havanna.

I reported this to Bundy on the 19th of November -- by the

way, my call to Valao was the l8th -- he said that after their

agenda had been received, the President wanted to see me at the

White House and decide what to say and whether to go or what

we should do next. That was the 19th of November, three days

before the assassination.

On the 29th of November, LaChuga had seen! Miss Howard

and he wondered where things stood now. I passed the word to

him that I didn't know, but that until we were told differently

that we would continue

our conversation.

On the 2nd of December he confirmed. getting a letter from

Valao and he wanted to know if i things had changed again. He

said he was authorized to talk to me in general terms.

I called the White House, Chase in this case, to say that

the ball was now in our court.

On December 4th, LaChuga again looked me up at the UN;

said he now had a lettar directly from Castro approving the

detailed talks and an agenda.

Again, I informed Chase.

He said the decision would take some time now because all

our policies were under review.

This went on. I kept seeing LaChuga and LaChuga would say

he was waiting for an answer, and I kept saying well the door

isn't closed, I just don't know.

On the 17th of December the President, this time President

Johnson, came to the Waldorf to meet with the delegation at

Stevenson's apartment and told me that he had read my Cuban

memo recapitulating the events of the discussions in the fall

with interest and that was

that. And I then was in washington.

Averell Harriman asked me about the Cuban project. I said I

didn't know, that it was lying down in Chase's office in the

White House and that he told me he'd get back to me after the

holidays.

Well, that ended my diary in '63. I then went to Kenya

as Ambassador in February of '64. However I do recall that

some time in January I again called Chase and I said, well, if

this thing is going to be continued I would suggest either

John Case or someone on that mission. He said, well, it doesn't

look as though it's going to be continued now because it's an

election year, or whatever the reason was, and anyway we'll keep

it in mind but that it was

a dead issue.

The interesting thing, I think in terms of your investiga-

tion is that whatever was yoing on in terms of assassination

plots, certainly there seemed to be two tracks, because it seems

hard for me to believe that the Executive would be approving this

type of negotiation while other covert oparations were happening.

although it could conceivably have happened.

The Chairman. If it did happen, what we are in search of

I think your testimony is helpful. Certain inferences

On May 20, 1975, I reviewed one file of documents

agent report of April 20, 1961, transmitted by a memo to

Assistant Attorney General on April 25, 1961). He said

MEMORANDUM

TO:

File

FIom:

Mason Cargill

Subject: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DOCUMENTS

On the afternoon of May

20, 1975, I briefly

examined the Justice Department files on the Kennedy assassi-

nation, ranging from February 18, 1969, to January 28, 1971.

According to Mr. Keeney and his

secretary who has reviewed

these files in detail,

they contain no memo from any State

Department employee who was in Mexico in 1963.

Basically these

files consist of letters from citizens, some referred from

congressmen, and press clippings relating to the assassination.

Mr. Keeney's secretary referred me to several

entries in these files respecting allegations by people who

claimed to have been involved in the Kennedy assassination.

One claimed to have been a CIA agent. There are also many

letters from assassination "nuts."

Other documents relate

to court proceedings to force FBI agents to testify in the

Clay Shaw trial in Louisiana.

One document is an FBI report, dated February 2,

1972, stating that one Richard von Kleist had contacted the

FBI claiming he had information on the John F. Kennedy

assassination. Kleist claimed certain people conspired in

the Hotel Luna, Mexico City, in July, 1963. Kleist was

not

a State Department employee.

He appeared to be a free-lance

magazine writer.

that before looking at the FBI as to possible "leaks," he should carefully examine his

own house. I told him I was quite thoroughly familiar with the way Guthman and

Rosenthal dealt with the press and that as he well knew the wire service people stayed

'constantly in Guthman's private office. I told him it was quite obvious to me how the

AP had learned that the report had been sent over to the Department.

Katzenbach reiterated that he had no complaints against the FBI. He

stated again that the purpose of his call was to tell me about Senator Russell's feelings.

He added that he had another reason for calling and that was to determine

if we could give him any ideas as to how Warren Olney could be dropped as Chief

Counsel of*the Presidential Commission. I told Katzenbach of our feelings concerning

Olney. He stated that the was presently working through Congressman Hale Boggs and

he thought he was going to be successful in getting Olney's name removed from

consideration. He told me that Boggs was very sympathetic.

Katzenbach mentioned that Waggoner Carr, the Texas State Attorney

General, would like very much to see the Director on Friday, 12-6-63. I asked him

what for. He stated that Carr had no particular motive in mind other than to indicate

to the press later on that he had discussed matters with the Director. I told him I could

agency and that Carr's dealings should be with the Department and the Presidential

Commission. Katzenbach indicated that the White House might think otherwise. He

stated that the President was most anxious for Carr to be given attention in Washington

inasmuch as Carr was running for office next year. Itold Katzenbach I knew this,

however, I still felt that the Director should not be injected into this matter.

Rat zenbach stated he would attempt to disuade Carr from seeing the Director, however,

Carr was quite persistent.

ACTION:

In view of the close friendship which Carr obviously has with the

President, the Director may desire to just shake hands with Carr without sitting down

and discussing facts concerning our report.

ASSASSINATION OF THE PRESIDENT

Balligan

While at the offices of the President's Comnission on other

matters,

J: Lee Rankin requested Malley to stop by his office

Rankin

advised that he desired to

make it known that the Bureau had been of tremen-

that an extronely large nute of

cooperative in handling all requests which had been made by the President's

Conmission.

He commented that recently there had been quite an increase in the

number of requests and

there was

a possibility that there would be many more

additional requests. Mre Kankin

stated this was not intended as a criticis

of the Bureau's work but instead was the following through of the connis :

sion's desire to complete the Commission's record and leave no unanswered

¡questions.

Bil

In this regard,

Mr. Rankin went on to say that the Bureau, in.

conducting its investigation

had an extremely difficult and enormous task

to perform and that he as weil as other menbers of the Commission staff had

been amazed at the amount of detailed information which had been developed

oy the Bureau in its investigation.

He concented that the Comnission in;

performing its tasks was of necessity making a most minute study of the

Bureau's work as well as that of other Goverment agencies with the idea of..

picking the investigation to pieces to the extreme degree so that wherever

it was possible to clarify any item, this could be handled while the

| Commission was in existence.

= i

Mr. Rankin advised that in connection with the letter which had

just recently been transmitted to the Bureau requesting an explanation con-

cerning information relative to Special Agent James P. Hosty's nane being

omitted from a report prepared in

the Dallas Office (report of special Agent

Robert l'. Gemberling dated 12/23/63), he wanted the

that prior to any

question being raised concerning.

visa in

these

conditions.

Fe expected to process the visa.

He knew it

would take long to process the fussian visa and would watt for it in

Cuba and leavs from there.for the USSR. IV. - The thing is that if his

wife is now in mashington she will receive the visa for returing to

Pussia.

She will receive the visa in rashington and having the visa

she can sent it to any place for example here or any other place but

right now she doesn't have it. SILVIA - Naturally, and we can't give

him a letter of recommendation because se don't know if his visa will

be approved.

IV. - se will only zive the visa according to indications

(intructions) SILVIA. - Then that is what I will put in my plans.

IV.-

se can't give him a letter of recormendation either becuese we

don't know him.

Please parson the bother. SILVIA .- No bother and

An Extract From Kennedy's Address to Press

Washington Post, Tuesday, November 19, 1963, p. A15

(AP) Nov. 18 -- The following is a text of President Kennedy's address

tonight before the Inter-American Press Association:

"The genuine Cuban revolution -- because it was against the tyran-

ny and corruption of the past -- had the support of many whose aims and

concepts were noble.

"But that hope for freedom and progress was destroyed.

"The goals proclaimed in the Sierra Maestra were betrayed in Havana.

"It is important to restate what now divides Cuba from my country

and from all the American countries: It is the fact that a small band

of conspirators has stripped the Cuban people of their freedom and hand-

ed over the independence and sovereignty of the Cuban nation to forces

beyond the hemisphere.

They have made Cuba a victim of foreign imperial-

ism,

an instrument of the policy of others, a weapon in an effort dic-

tated by external powers to subvert the other American republics.

This,

and this alone divides us." As long as this

is true nothing is possible.

Without it everything is possible.

Ready and Anxious

"Once this barrier is, removed we will be ready and anxious to work

with the Cuban people in pursuit of those progressive goals which, a few

short years ago, stirred their hopes and the sympathy of many people

throughout the entire hemisphere.

"No Cuban need feel trapped between dependence on the broken prom-

ises of foreign communism and the hostility of the rest of the hemisphere.

For once Cuban sovereignty has been restored we will extend the hand of .

friendship and assistance to a Cuba whose political and economic insti-

tutions have been shaped by the will of the Cuban people."

Unofficial Envoy

An Historic Report from Two Capitals

by Jean Daniel

A recent trip to the United States, followed by a jouney to Cuba, made it

possible for me to establish a "'dialogue" betiocen the late President Kennedy and

Prime Minister Fidel Castro. Sinde my arrionl in Mexico, ichere this article is

being written, I have been asked whether the impressions I derived from these

interviers could shed any light on the assassination of the President and on

future relations beticeit Lyndon B. Johnson and Castro.

Last weck in these pages I rinswered the first question by describing the re-

actions of Fidel Castro, with rohion I was visiting at the time, to Jolm Ken-

nedy's death. Here I shall explore the second question by reconstituting the

Kennedy-Castro dinlogue from thie viewpoint of one who was a witness to it.

THE AUTHOR

President Kennedy received me at the White House

on Thursday, October 24. My appointment had been

scheduled for 5:30. I waited in the Cabinet Conference

'ocm, and at 5:45 the President, following his usual

custom, came to look for me himself so that he could

escort me into his office. He apologized for the delay,

no: so much as a courtesy or to flatter me, but to ex-

plain the scheduling of his time, which seemed to be

ver: strictly organized. As we passed through the small

roon where his secretary was working, we caught a

glimpse of Mrs. Kennedy leaving by a French window

on her way to the private garden of the White House.

The President called her back to introduce me.:

Is was still Indian summer in Washington. The

weather was very warm, and both the President and

Mr. Kennedy were very lightly dressed, thus enhanc-

ing the impression of youth, charm, and simplicity

which was in rather surprising contrast to the solemnity

of entering these august chambers.. The President

(athletic looking in his well-tailored suit, speaking with

quick, abrupt gestures and a mobile expression but, at

times, freezing up and becoming disconcertingly, al-

most, I would say, completely expressionless) invited

me to be seated on the semi-circular sofa which was in

the middle of his office. He sat in a rocking chair op-

posite the sofa. The interview was to last from 20 to 25

minutes, and it was interrupted only by a brief tele-

phone call.

The President immediately asked me how the French

situation was developing. After my reply, he spoke

about General de Calle. He talked in a relaxed fashion,

like someone who has at last found solace in indiffer-

ence after having long been exasperated and fascinated

John Kennedy was a man who liked to get to the heart

of a matter quickly, animake decisions even more

rapidly. But this was not possible in dealing with de

Gaulle, who is more difficult to handle than Khru-

shchev. One day, impatient at not understanding the

General's reasoning and intent upon convincing him,

Kennedy telephoned de Gaulle direct: All in vain. Odd-

ly enough, however, since the recent visit of de Gaulle's

foreign minister, Couve de Murville, to Washington

Mr. Kennedy had ceased to be so deeply concerned

about Franco-American relations. The truth is, he had

made up his mind not to worry about them any more.

According to him, it was a waste of time.

"Mr. Couve de Murville and I both verified that we

didn't agree on anything," the President told me. "And

we agreed that such total disagreement was hardly cal-

culated to create a flourishing friendship between two

great Western nations. I came to the conclusion that

rieneral de Gaulle's strategy, which is rather incom-

prehensible to me, requires a certain amount of tension

with the United States. It would seem that only through

chis tension is it possible to restore to Europê the desire

to, think for itself and renounce its torpid dependence

on American dollar aid and political guidance!

President Kennedy went on to sum up, with con-

ciseness and vigor, the points of disagreement between

the United States and France. On the subject of Ger-

many, nuclear policy, Europe, the len of "indepen-

ince," he told me what has since

become public

15

NW 50955 DocId: 32423630 Page 631

## Page 629

Thr

knowledge. He added, however, that

France had

strange way of manifesting its independence, part.-

ularly, for example, on the subject of Vietnam

and

Cuba. It seemed ironic and irritating to him that the

French Chief Executive was apparently bent on telling

more appreciative than he of advice, information, and

even criticism; but that these were all the more valued

if the friends proffering them were themselves com-

mitted to a program of action.

I then asked Mr. Kennedy what could be expecteil

from General de Gaulle's proposed visiti to the United

States next February: He replied: "Absolutely nothing."

But he followed this up immediately and with a broad

grin, as though savering in advance the pleasure of

the impending meeting:

"It will be exciting, just the

same. General de Gaulle is an historic figure; he is de-

cidely the strangest great man of our time."

Relations with Cuba

Taking the initiative at this point, I brought up the

subject of Vietnam and Cuba, saying that the Gaullists

were not the only ones in France who deplored certain

mistaken US policies. I pointed out that the first time

that speech been faithfully applied in

Saigon and

Havana? Here my notes are very specific, and I shall

let the late President speak through them:

"We haven't enough time to talk about

Vietnam,

but I'd like to talk to you about Cuba. Incidentally, our

conversation will be much more interesting when you

return, because Ben Bradlee [of Newsweek] tells me

you are on your way to Cuba now.

"Every now and then I read articles in the European

press pointing out that we Americans were blind to

what was happening in the Cuban situation. I have just

learned that General de Gaulle himself regarded Com-

munism in Cuba as nothing but the accidental and

temporary form of a will to independence from the

United States. Of course it is very easy to understand

this 'will to independence around President de Caulle.".

John Kennedy then mustered all his persuasive force.

He punctuated each sentence with that brief, mechan-

ical gesture which had become famous:

"I tell you this: we know perfectly, what happened

In Cuba, to the misforeme de all, From the beginning

I personally followed the development of these events

with mounting concern. There are few subjects to which

I have devoted more painstaking attention. My conclu-

sions go much further than the European analyses. Here

is what I believe.

16

RH 50955 DooId: 32423630

Page 632

"I believe that there is no country in the world, in-

cluding all the African regions, meluding any and all

the countries under colonial domination, where

CCO-

nomic colonization, humiliation and expicitation were

worse than in Cuba, in part owing to my country's

policies during the Batista regime. I believe that se

created, built and manufactured the Castro movement

out of whole cloth and without realizing it. I believe

that the accumulation of these mistakes has jeopardized

all of Latin America. The great aim of the Alliance for

Progress is to reverse this unfortunate policy. This is

one of the most, if not the most, important problems in

American foreign policy. I can assure you that I have

understood the Cubans. I approved the proclamation

which Fidel Castro made in the Sierra Maestra, when

he justifiably called for justice and especially yearned to

rid Cuba of corruption. I will go even further: to some

extent it is as though Batista was the incarnation of a

number of sins on the part of the United States. Now

we shall have to pay for those.sins. In the matter of the

Batista regime, I am in agreement with the first Cuban

revolutionaries. That is perfectly clear."

After a silence during which he was able to note my

surprise and my interest, the President continued: "But

it is also clear that the problem has ceased to be a

Cuban one, and has become international - that is, it

has become a Soviet problem. I am the President of the

United States and not a sociologist; I am the President

of a free nation which has certain responsibilities in the

Free World. I know that Castro betrayed the promises

made in the Sierra Maestra, and that he has agreed lo

be a Soviet agent in Latin America. I know that throgh

his fault - either his 'will to independence', his nad-

ness or Communism - the world was on the verge of

nuclear war in October, 1962. The Russians understood

this very well, at least after our reaction; but.so far as

Fidel Castro. is concerned, I must say I don't know

whether he realizes this, or even if he cares about it."

A smile, then: "You can tell me whether he does when :

you come back. In any case, the nations of Latin Amer-

ica are not going to attain justice and progress that

way, I mean through Communist subversion.

They

won't get there by going from cconomic oppression to

a Marxist dictatorship which Castro himself denounced

a few years ago. The United States now has the pos-

sibility of doing as much good in Latin America, as it

has done wrong in the past; I would even say that we

alone have this power - on the essential condition that

Communism does not take over there."

Mr. Kennedy then rose to indicate lat the interview

was over. I apologized for keeping him toxas two

quick questions. The first: Could the United

States

tolerate economic collectivisin? He answered

about Sekou Touré? And Tito? I received Masha Viro

three days ago; and our discussions were

most posi-

June 30, 1975

• Committee Contact' with Sam Giancana

To my knowledge the Committee's first contact with Sam

Giancana occurred on June 9, 1974, when Patrick Shea of the

Committee staff received a telephone communication from

Robert Bennett, Assistant District Attorney, Houston, Texas.

It is my information from

talking to Mr. Shea that Mr. Bennett.

called the Committee to advise that Sam Giancana was admitted

to the Methodist Hospital, which was located at 6515 Bertner

Street in Houston, Texas.

Mr. Bennett's information was that

Giancana was admitted to Room 402 of the Hospital under the

care of a Dr. Debakey. Mr.' Bennett also advised that Giancana

was there for a gall bladder removal operation. I believe, al-

though I am not positive, that Bennett also advised that

Giancana was then under surveillance. My recollection at this

time is not clear as to whether Bennett advised as to which

agency or organization had Giancana under surveillance, but my

impression is that it was not the F.B.I.

At about the time of this communication from Bennett, I, as

Committee Counsel, had been attempting to locate Mr. Giancana.

I had discussed his possible testimony before the Committee

with Chief Counsel, Fritz Schwarz, and Staff Director, William

Miller. It is my recollection that we agreed that I should

attempt to contact Giancana

for the purposes of interview-

ing him in order to determine whether he would have suffi-

cient information to warrant an appearance before the Commit-

tee as a whole: It is my memory that we did decide that

he was of sufficient importance to be interviewed by the

Staff, i.e.,

for me to'interview him.

During this same

period of time, I discussed with

Messrs. Schwarz and Miller whether we should consider

issuing a subpoena for Mr. Giancana while he was in the

hospital.

I made this suggestion because of an impression

I had that Giancana was difficult to locate. I should add

that I see absolutely nothing prejudicial or improper or

discourteous in the issuing of a subpoena, but rather

regard a subpoena as a valid method of obtaining testimony

before a Congressional Committee. In any event, my dis-

cussion with Messrs. Schwarz and Miller resulted in a

decision to have me contact Mr. Giancana over the telephone

and offer him an opportunity to appear before the Committee

voluntarily and to have me interview him if he so agreed.

If he did not agree, we would then take it before the Com-

NY 50955 DooId:32423630 Page

- 3-

mittee as to whether a subpoena should be issued for Mr.

Giancana. Because of the events that followed we never

reached the point of bringing before the Committee the ques-

tion of whether Giancana should be subpoenaed to testify.

After the initial phone call from Bennett to Shea, I

telephoned Bennett on two different occasions. My telephone

contact with. Bennett was for the purpose of our locating

Giancana and a telephone number at which I could reach him.

Bennett initially indicated to me, as described earlier

in

this memorandum, that Giancana was in the hospital. My recol-

lection is that on my second telephone call with Bennett, he

informed me that Giancana was now out of the hospital and

staying at

the Warwick Hotel. Finally, I recall calling the

Methodist Hospital in Houston and asking to speak to Mr:

Giancana. I recall that the hospital authorities indicated

that they had no such person by that name in the hospital.

I do not recall the precise date of this telephone communication

to the hospital. It is my recollection that the name used by

Giancana was Doc Brown. I am uncertain whether Bennett told me

Giancana was using "Doc Brown" at both the hospital and the

hotel, but I believe he said that the alias was used at the

hospital. Bennett advised that Giancana had been visited by

several relatives. and gave me the names of a cuple of persons

NW 50955 DocId: 32423630 Page 636

---

## Page 634

- 4 -

who he thought were Giancana's sons-in-law.

The only name

I remember is that of Tisci.

In either the second or possibly a third conversation

with Bennett, he told me that Giancana had now checked out

of the hotel and was either on his way back to his home in

Oak Park; Illinois, or

with his daughter in California. He

provided me with the telephone number of the daughter in

California and suggested I obtain Giancana's home number from

the information directory in Illinois.

The telephone conversations with Bennett occurred, to

the best of my recollection, during the week of June 16, 1975.

It is possible, however, that the first conversation occurred

later in the week of June 9. It is my recollection that my

second telephone conversation with Bennett occurred on Thurs-

day June 19. In any event, I am certain that I attempted to.

contact Giancana by telephone on Thursday, June 19. I was

unable to get anyone to answer the telephone in California

and did not have an opportunity to attempt to obtain the

Illinois number.

I learned Friday, June 20 that Giancana had

been shot and killed in his home in Oak Park, Illinois on.

the evening of June 19.

Slain Mobster Claimed

Cuban Link to JFK Death

By Ronald Kessler and Laurence Stern

Washington Post Stall Writers

Long before his recent murder,

John Rosselli. the CIA's underworld

recruit in attempts to kill Fidel Cas-

tro, had been privately claiming that

agents of the Cuban premier, in retali-

ation, were involved in the

assassina-

tion of President John F. Kennedy.

Rosselli's belief in a Cuban connec-

tion to the Kennedy assassination was

¡expressed through

his attorney,

Ed-

ward

P. Morgan, to the FBI as long.

ago as March, 1967, and also in private.

;conversations with a longtime associ-

ate of Rosselli who participated in

meetings between Rosselli and the

CIA.

An FBI "blind memorandum" on

an

interview

with

Morgan

dated

March 21, 196%, was included, without

identification of the interviewee,, in

last June's

Senate Intelligence Com-

mittee's report on the role of the in-

telligence

community in the Kennedy

assassination investigation.

Morgan told the FBI that Rosselli

and another Morgan client had in-

formed him that Castro became aware

of

CIA

assassination

conspiracies

against him and

"thereafter employed

teams of individuals who were dis.

patched to the United States for the

purpose

of assassinating Mr. Ken-

nedy'."

Because neither. Morgan nor Ros-

selli was identified in the Senate re-.

port, the significance of that portion

of the 106-page

document was dis-

counted at the time it was published:

in June,

before. Rosselli's disappear.

ance and the subsequent discovery of

his body in an

waters. The Washington Post, however,

has confirmed that Morgan and Rosselli

were the sources of the testimony. that

suggested a Cuban role in the Ken-

nedy murder.

Morgan's account,

according; to a

summary of the FBI interview, was

that Rosselli had reached his conclu-

sion about a Cuban connection to the

Kennedy

assassination:

from

"feedback" furnished by

sources close

to Castro who were involved in the ClA

plots to assassinate the Cuban leader.

"His (Morgan's) clients were aware

of the identity of some of the individ-

uals who came to the United States

for this purpose and he understood

that two such individuals were now in

the state of New Jersey,". the FBI in-

• terview summary stated.

A long-time associate. of Rosselli-

who was interviewed separately by

: The Washington Post, said there was

; no question in

the slain mobster's

i mind that President Kennedy

was.

¿ killed on Castro's behalf in reprisal

: for the CIA schemes against the Cu-.

ban leader.

"He was positive; he was sure." said

, the associate, who knew Rosselli well

and was in contact with him

before

Rosselli disappeared from his Florida

home on July 28. The associate, who

does not want to be identified pub-

¿licly, is scheduled to be interviewed

• this week by Dade County. Fla.. homi-

cide detectives. He was a party to Ros-

selli's contacts in the early. 1960s with

CIA case officers overseeing the at-

tempts to assassinate Castro.

Despite occasional speculation, the

collective conclusion of all

official

U.S. government investigations into

the Kennedy assassination-including

the Warren Commission, the FBI and

the CIA-has been that there was no

evidence that implicated the Castro

• government or any of its agents.

However, the CIA's involvement in

the schemes to assassinate Castro

was not divulged to the Warren Com-

mission, and knowledge of them was

confined

until 1967 to a small, elite

, circle of the U.S. intelligence commu-

nity. President Johnson

apparently

first learned about the schemes only

after a March 7, 1967, column by the

late Drew Person,

which prompted

* Johnson to order a CIA investigation

of the highly sensitive episode.

Full details of the CIA-underworld

collusion in the plots to kill Castro

did not surface publicly until the pub-

•lication last year of the Senate Intelli-

gence Committee's assassination

port and the ensuing report last June

The body of Rosselli, who lived

flamboyantly in a world of mobsters,

politicians and playgiris, was found

two weeks ago in an inverted oil drum

Senate testimony on the CIA schemes

to kill Castro has brought the FBI

into the investigation at the request

of Attorney General Edward H. Levi.

The involvement of Rosselli, Gian-

underworld figures-

Tampa, Fla., whose one-time Havana

gambling enterprises fell hostage in

1959 to the Cuban revolution-in plots

against Castro had been a closely held

secret within the top echelons of the

CIA and FBI until recently.

The tangled chronology of suppres

sion and eventual disclosure, although

detailed in the June report, has re-

ceived little public attention. Rossel-

li's murder adds significance to those

sequence, pieced to-

from the testimony given to

Senate intelligence investigators:

Pearson went to

of the United

States Earl Warren late in.: January,

1967, and told him that a Washington

lawyer had confided to him that one

of his clients

said the United States

"had attempted to

assassinate Fidel

Castro in the early 1960s and Castro.

had decided to retaliate."

Warren declined Pearson's

tion that he see the lawyer,

Edward Morgan. Warren referred the

matter to then Secret Service Direc-

tor James J. Rowley, who on Feb. 13,

1967, wrote FBI Director J. Edgar Ho-

over, informing him of the 'allegations.

* Hoover sent the Rowley letter to six

The interview was assigned to two

which

the Senate

committee concluded was "puzzling"

because it was the Domestic Intelli

which had been

possible foreign involvement in the

Neither agent was privy to the

knowledge, confined to Hoover

and

his top aides, of the CIA's assassina-

tion plots against Castro. Both agents

testified eight years later that they

were

"surprised"

when

Morgan

"These agents stated

that they

Elaborate plans were made, including

. the infiltration of the Cuban Govern-

that he was out of the dountry at the

FRITZ AND BILL

MIKE EPSTEIN

JUNE 20, 1975

SUBJECT: GIANCANA

I expect that no one will write off the alleged Giancana murder as a

"third-rate homicide," and that it will grow and grow and grow.. It is clearly

the most volatile media issue of the season.

Given the barest outlines of what allegedly happened, and taking them

at face value, we have a responsibility to take action under 18 U.S. Code,

Section 1505:

Whoever

.... by .. force ... endeavors to ... impede any

witness

... in connection with any inquiry or investigation

being had by ... any committee of either House

... or

Whoever ... by ... force ... obstructs, or impedes or

endeavors to ...:

obstruct, or impede

... the due and proper

exercise of the power of inquiry under which such inquiry

or investigation is being had by ... any committee of

either House ...

Shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more

than five years, or both.

In short, if Giancana was a "witness" (which status he might have

achieved by mere location contacts made by staff) and he was killed to

prevent his appearance; or indeed

even if he wasn't yet a "witness" but

this was a ",

message" to all witnesses to keep quiet (e.g. Roselli and Maheu),

there is a violation of law which we might have the responsibility to investigate.

Beyond what our responsibility is, it seems clear to me that most extreme

possibilities of what might actually have happened dictate that we come up

with a well-reasoned position and plan -- after careful, deliberate, intensive

consideration of all avenues of approach, pitfalls, suspected motives, etc.

Most important of all, it seems to me, is our acceptance of the fact that

maybe we don't even have anyone on our staff with sufficient experience,

sophistication, background, and investigative maturity to deal with this

situation.

As a first step, I urgeiyour decision to convene a planning

session to

decide what the second step will be.

I can't emphasize enough the need for well-thought-out planning here.

Who knows where this will lead? And at a minimum, some months from now,

Senator Church may be asked, "What did you do the day after you learned

that' Giancana had been killed?" .

My stream of consciousness on kinds of things to consider would

include: What our public statement on this should or should not be,

security for other witnesses, immediate contact with other key witnesses

(to reassure them), secrecy of witness lists and immunity applications,

secrecy of place, time and even fact of interview, meetings with Justice

organized crime section, Chicago strike force, local law enforcement people

in Oak Park and Illinois, obtaining all FBI investigative reports (they're

in it per tonight's Star), getting background on all law enforcement officials

in Illinois who will be involved. (whom do you trust?), is this a diversion

which we're being sucked into, how do we avoid that (hire someone just for

this), how do we show we care so other witnesses (known or unknown) won't

dry up, etc. etc. etc.

MEMORANDUM:

TO: Mike Madigan

FROM: Ed Greissing

DATE: August 13, 1976

SUBJECT: Mention of Carlos Marcello in the 4/23/76 transcript of

John Rosselli.

On April 23, 1976 during Mi. Rosselli's appearance before the

Schweiker-Hart Subcommittee, we took the opportunity to question

him about any information he might possess regarding the New Orleans

Mafia Chieftan, Carlos Marcello.

Our interest in Marcello developed from l)uthe allegation that

Marcello was tangentially involved with both Clay Shaw and David

Ferrie; the fact that Marcello was deported by Attorney General Robert

Kennedy and that

the assassination of President Kennedy was a possible

retaliation,

In my telephone conversation with Jim Johnston, 8/13/76, he could

think of no other reasons why we questioned Rosselli about Marcello.

If you would like to talk to Jim about this matter, his telephone

number is 780-6203.

Inspector General's Report states that Maheu was instructed

to tell Roselli that Maheu represented businesses (Wall Street)

who had interests in Cuba and who wanted to eliminate Castro and

were willing to pay $150,000.

Roselli -- Trafficante's gambling interests in Cuba -- interest

in killing Castro?

I.G. Report indicates "first meeting" to be 14 September 1960

in New York City, with Maheu, Roselli and O'Connell present.

I.G. Report indicates that Roselli introduced Maheu to Giancana

and that Giancana was to arrange contacts with syndicate elements

in Cuba -- meeting for Roselli/Maheu/Giancana meeting in Fountain-

bleu Hotel in Florida week of 25 September 1960. I. G. Report

I.G. Report in

"Second Phase" indicates Roselli telling

O'Connell that Trafficante knew a man high up in the Cuban exile

movement who could take over the job from Orta. Report indicates

this man's name is Varona, and that Trafficante probably knew

Varona in his efforts to take over gambling once Castro was out.

O'Connell's Testimony

O'Connell's recollection is that Orta's man would not go through

with it and that the pills were

returned to O'Connell by Roselli.

O'Connell's recollection then is that the second plan was a call

from

Roselli and Maheu indicating the use of a chef. The pills

were sent down and again returned when this plot failed.

O'Connell is unclear which of the aforementioned schemes took

place before the Bay of Pigs. He indicates, however, the use of

Varona to be after the Bay of Pigs.

O'Connell has the first introduction of Roselli and Harvey as

being in the Miami airport.

O'Connell's testimony is that he received a call from Maheu

who said that Giancana was upset about Phyllis MacGuire seeing

Dan Rowan. Maheu said that he had been requested to place a tap

for Giancana and that Giancana might "stop helping" on the assassina-

tion plot if this tap was not placed. O'Connell checked with

Edwards and received the go-ahead. O'Connell indicates that

Maheu was authorized to pay for DuBois out of the month given him

on the assassination plan.

O'Connell states that he recalls November 1960 as the time

period of the delivery of the pills for Roselli through Trafficante?

O'Connell recollection that "chef" incident after Bay of Pigs.

O'Connell states that Varona's price was $50,000 = $10,000

worth of communications equipment in addition.

O'Connell introduced by Roselli to Varona as "Mr. Olds."

ZRRIFLE was to be applied to Cuba.

Harvey reference to pressure from the Kennedys to topple the

Castro regime clandestinely and not by means of any attack.

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

I am writing you today on behalf of the Select

Committee about the recent death of Samuel Giancana. As

you are no doubt aware, his name has been raised in the

context of allegations concerning the central Intelligence

Agency's possible involvement in so-called political

assassinations.

Based on information available to the Committee,

It was obvious that he might be knowledgeable about the

political assassination matter. Although Mr. Giancana

had not actually been subpoenaed to testify by this Com-

?mittee, he had been approached by members of the staff

for a possible interview. Since this might involve viola-

tion of federal statutes pertaining to obstruction of a

Congressional Committee Investigation, the Select Committee

1s requesting that you instruct the Federal Bureau of

Investigation to keep It

fully informed of all information

coming to the Bureau's attention pertaining to Mr. Giancana's

death. In making this request, the Committee 1s not conced-

Ing. its right to conduct its own investigation of

this

matter

However, It is acting in the spirit of cooperation

on a question of mutual concern to the Executive and Legis-

lative Branches of government.

WW 50955 DocId:52423630 Page 654

---

## Page 652

The Committee is also concerned about the

safety of several other possible witnesses.

Therefore,

we request 24-hour-a-day protection by the United States

Marshall Service for the following witnesses

which the

Committee has subpoenaed, intends to subpoena, has inter-

viewed, or intends to interview:

(Alternative paragraph:

The Committee Is also concerned about the

safety of several other possible witnesses.

We would

like to discuss with members of your staff the necessity

for special arrangements by the United States Marshall

Service to ensure the safety of witnesses who have or

might have to contact with the Committee pertaining to

these matters.)

Yes, sir; I would like to read it to the committee.

Mr. BRown.

Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, I am

Neil G. Brown, chief of the Police Department of the city of Tampi,

I have been a member of the Tampa Police Department for the past

16 years, and I have been chief of the department for the past 4 years.

Prior to my appointment as chet, I served as inspector of detectives

I am a graduate of the National Police Academy of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation, and a member of the Tampa Bay Area Chiefs

of Police Association and of the International Association of Chiefs

of Police.

With me here today is Sgt. Jack de la Llana who, at my direction,

formed our department's first criminal intelligence unit in February

ot 1962, and has been its director since that time.

Sergeant de la

lana also holds the important post of chairman of the Florida In-

telligence

Unit, a statewide agency which coordinates information

amongst intelligence units in cities throughout the State of Florida.

In addition to Sergeant de la Llana, whose diligent work and knowl-

edge of criminal operations has provided much of the foundation for

my statement to you, I feel fortunate in being accompanied also by

Sgt. Willian Branch of the intelligence division of the Orlando Polico

Department.

Sergeant Branch is presently attending the National

Academy

of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation.

He has been &

member of the Orlando Police Department since 1951, and a detective

sergeant since 1956.

He is particularly familiar with organized gam-

bling operations in the central Florida area, and I believe his presents-

tion of that situation will be of material value to this inquiry.

I feel privileged to be able to testify before you today.

I beliere

that the facts I can present here about organized crime operations in

Tampa will help you and the American public realize the seriousness

of this problem, and our Nation's emergent need for further Federal

legislation to combat an evil that has clearly expanded beyond the

May I ask a question, Chief, there?

As I understand what you have just testified relative to the grand

jury's report,

they acknowledged that there was some evidence of the

existence of Sicilian Mafia in the community, but apparently felt

that evidence was not conclusive; is that a correct summary?

Mr. BROwN.

That is correct; yes, senator.

The Tampa Police De-

partment, however, has long been aware that many criminals in our

area have local reputations as Mafiosi.

My staff and I have made a

careful evaluation of those reputations, based upon

personal knowl-

ege, criminal records, surveillance reports, personal histories, familial

relationships,

statistical analyses, reports from confidential inform-

ants, information from Federal and local luw-enforcement agencies,

and other customary police intelligence sources.

It is our considered conclusion that the Mafia exists in Tampa, that

it controls most illegal gambling in

Tampa and central Florida, and

that its members have interstate and international ties to other Mafia

groups.

The organization of the Mafia in the Tampa area is best understood

from a chart we have formulated which I submit to this subcommittee

as our exhibit No. 2.

Senator Muskir. Before me get to that, Chief, may I ask another

question?

The grand jury to which you referred sat in 1956, am I

correct?

Mr. BrowN. That is correct, sir.

Senator MosKIF.

That is 7 years ago. Do you think you have

accumulated additional evidence as to the existence of the Mafia in

Tampa which would justify a new reference to the grand jury?

MIr. BRowN. Yes; I believe so.

Senator Muskie. Are you planning that?

Mr. Brown. Yes, sir.

The CHASIAN.

Very well. This chart may be received as eshibit

No. 45 and we will direct it be printed in the record if it can be, as

far as it can be.

The title of it is "The Mafia Organization in the

Tampa, Fla., Area."

(The document referred to was marked "Exhibit No. 45" for refer-

ence and faces this page.)

Would you say the operations of this organized

soup are not confined just to the city limits of Tampa, but they are

in the area?

Mr. BRowN. By all means; the entire area.

The CIrInsAN. All right.

This chart is now a part of the record

and, if you wish to comment about it, we will proceed with your state-

ment.

Mr. Brown. The chart is keyed to show only the criminal, business,

and familial interrelationships and activities of the persons named,

although other criteria figured m our categorization of these persons.

Of course, this chart cannot be considered as a definitive

"table of

organization" of the Tampa Mafia, because it is but a simplified repre-

sentation of an organization that is in a constant state of flus, and about

which we know we still have many things to learn.

However, I believe it is completely accurate in showing that Santo

Traflicante is the boss of this criminal group.

Indeed, it is to Santo

Traflicante that Tampa owes the dubious distinction of having been

represented at the notorious crime convention at Apalachin,

N.X.,

in November 1957.

The CumIraaN. I notice you designate or refer to this group as the

Mafia.

Would you say that it is the sume group that has been referred

to by the famous witness, Joe Valachi?

Mr. Brown. Yes. sir:itis

The CamaraN. Whether he calls it Cosa Nostra or the Mafia makes

no ditterence.

This is the organized crime group to which you re

ferred?

Mr. Brown. That is correct, Senator; this is the group.

Senator MusKu. May lask a question there:

Under this group, there is another group which you describe as

nonmember asseciates and employees.

Is that intended to

that the people who are so described know nothing about the identity

of their employers and the organization of which they are a part?

Mr. Brown. "Senator, that is a part of the insulation of the group.

They have many employees, and as we go into the statement, to show

how in this gambling

operation the seller is non-Sicilian in most

cases, and he reports to another member up the ladder, and so on up.

Many of these people are nonmembers of the Mafia as it is.

Senator Muskic. Do they know they are engaged in criminal ac-

tivities?

Mr: BRowN. Yes, sir.

Senator MusKIr.

They know they are a part of a criminal orga-

nization?

Mr. BRown. Yes, sir.

Senator MuskiE.

But they are not members?

Mr. BRowN. That is correct.

of a hoodlum ho is entrusted by the Mafia to act as a courier for them betreen

the various groups.

Coticchia was born on February 27, 1020, in Cincinnati,

Ohio.

When he was

arrested a couple of years ago, he gase as his occupation "industrial linancier."

He is presently reported to be interested in the operation of a company offering

mired music in the Chicago area known as Symphonaire Sound Systems, Inc.

Ilis criminal record shows that he

was first arrested in 1030 in

Ohio for

robbery.

In 1937 he was nrrested in Miami, Fla., for investigation of a "shake-

dow'n."

He was held for 4 days and released without charges.

He was arrested

again in Hot Springs, Ark, in 1938 for investigation and released with the under-

standing that he would leave the city.

In 1938, in Cleveland,

Coticchia was arrested and charged with assault with

intent to commit rape.

He was convicted and received 1 to 15 gears, of which

he served 1 years, being released in 1941.

Ile was arrested in 10t2 in Los Angeles,

Calif., on a warrant issued in Baltimore for grand theft.

He was tried in Balti-

more for receiving stolen goods and received 5 years in prison.

Coticchia was again arrested in Dallas,

Tex., in 1961,

by the U.S. marshals

for violation of and for conspiring to violate the Federal Securities and Exchange

Act of 1083, which case is still pending in the Southern District Court of New

J'ork.

His last arrest known to us was on January 4, 1903, when be was ar-

rested in Tampa for investigation of grand larceny.

He was released due to

insufficient evidence.

Coticchia worked as a "pit boss" in gambling casinos in Las Vegas, Nev., and

Klavana,

Cuba.

He was involved in a scandal in 1900 in which mobsters at-

tempted to take over a nationwide bail bond business.

Coticchia has been in and out of Tampa since our first obserration of him and

on every occasion he is in direct contact with Trafficante and Diecidue.

December 31, 1962, he purchased a new automobile in Tampa, paying the dealer

$3,627.05 in cash.

He then registered the car under the name of Jane Campbell.

He remained in Tampa several days and was in constant contact with Traficante

and Diecidue.

On January 4, 1963. Coticchia was arrested in Tampa on suspicion of grand

larceny and it the time of his arrest he had $1,775 in cash on his person.

had papers on him that showed he had resided previously at the Aloha Motel in

Miami under the name Luiz l'anlino Bailey from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

also had a paper with a list of gambling equipment and the name "Empress

Ltd.,

No. 3."

An investigation rerealed this equipment had been shipped airfreight from

Ins Yegas to Nassau and placed in a German vessel, the Wappen Ton Hamburg,

which sails between Nassau and aliam.

This equipment included 50 one-arm

bandits, or slot machines, and was valued in excess of $65.000.

received was that this vessel was to travel between Miami and Nassau as a

floating gambling casino.

After Coticchin's arrest in Tampa, the telephone calls were checked at the

inotel.

It showed that he had made several calls to Trafficante, Diecidue, and

other associates of Trafficante.

Ile had also made a long-distance call to sonny's

I would like to submit for the record Coticchia's FBI record, and a photograph

ot him taken by my department when he was arrested in Tampa on January

4, 1963.

Another erample of the Trafficante group's connections with Mafia figures in

other parts of the Nation is:

John Joseph Vitale, FBI No. 793250, of St. Lonis.

Mo.

Vitale is well known to the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department, and

is reputed to be the Matia leader in that area.

He has a record of 13 arrests

and a conviction for violating the Harrison Narcotics Act for which he received

a sentence of y years' imprisonment.

He has been arrested as a fence and is

beliered to deal in anything in which there is a large percentage of profit.

Police authorities consider him among the most dangerous of Mafia principals

in the St. Louis area, and he is known to have underworld connections through-

out the country.

Bettors can place bets on any number from

1 to 100 and receive a 60-to-1 return if they win.

The Cuba winning

number is the last two digits from the Cuban national lottery number

which is five digits and is broadcast over a Havana radio station each

Saturdy shortly after 2 p.m.

The public is contacted by "peddlers" or "sellers," who receive a com-

mission of 15 percent of their sales.

"Pickup" men, who take the bets

from the sellers to the "checkup houses,"

receive 20 percent of what

they collect.

Employees such as checkup men, adding machine opera-

tors, and supervisors above this position usually receive salaries for

their duties.

Lottery operations in central Florida prior to 1948 were dominated

first by Charlie Wall of Tampa and then by Sam Warren, an Orlando

native.

In that year Harlan Blackburn, FBI No. 1026922, a con-

victed felon, came into Orlando and began taking over bolita and

Cuba gambling.

530 ORGANIZED CRIME AND ILLICIT TRAFFIC IN NARCOTICS

It has also been obvious to us that the Trafficante organization has

controlled the Blackburn operation for at least the

From our examination of seized records, and from the fact that in

all raids on the checkup houses we have arrested persons having

close family ties with the Trafficante organization who were acting

as auditors for his interests.

In addition, there has been heavy tele-

phone toll traflic between the Trafficantes in Tampa and the Blackburn

group in Orlando.

When Blackburn was arrested in 1953, a memorandum was found

containing telephone numbers of Augustine Prino Lazzara,

tore.J. Lorenzo, J. Al. Cacciatore-mele of Santo Traflicante, Jr.-and

Santo Traficante, Jr., and of the Nebraska and Flamingo Bars, both

owned by the Trafficante family.

In 1957 a search of a gambling house in Orange County by a State

officer, with the assistance of the Orlando

Police, resulted in the

arrest of several persons.

One of these was Lorenzo and another per-

son by the name of Leto, from Tampa.

They both gave sworn state-

ments at that time to the county solicitor that they were working for

Santo Trafficante, Jr.

In November 1961, another raid was conducted by agents of the

Internal Rerenue

Service in conjunction with the Orlando Police

Department on a house in Orange County.

There were six persons

arrested, and among those were Armando Rios and Sam Cacciatore.

These tiro were cousins of Santo Traflicante, Jr.

In July 1963, a raid on a gambling house in Sanford, Fla., by the

IRS agents, with the assistance of the Orlando Police Department,

established that it was another operation

supervised by Clyde Lce.

During

the past 12 years that we know of at least three murders

that have been due to lights for control of lottery operations in the

Orlando area.

The fantastic amount of money taken in by these lottery operations

has been repeatedly established by our raids of these gambling houses.

For example, the raid in 1957 in Orange County, where Frank Ferreri

and Sam Lorenzo were arrested, disclosed that the house was doing

a gross business of $100,000 per week.

Senator Muskr. What were they paying out?

MIr. BRAncH.

The profit on this operation runs about 50 percent.

The November 1961 raid in Orange County where Armando Rios

and Sam Cacciatore, cousins of Santo Traflicante, were arrested re-

vealed that operation was doing a conservatively estimated gross of

$160,000 per week.

TESTIMONY OF NEIL G. BROWN- Resumed

Mr. Brows. To understand the crime network Trafficante operates

it is necessary to eramine the modern er of crime in 'Tampa, which

dates from the early 1020)'s.

Its most violent episodes were between

1937 and 1915, when the Sictln underworld was attempting to move

in on all illegul gambling in 'Tampa.

This period in the history of our

city was referred to as "the era of blood"

Senator Muskie. Who coined that phrase, the gang or the news-

Mr. Browv. I think it was the newspapers, Senator.

During the 1920's, before the Sicilian underworld moved into the

rackets to any great extent, one of our most notorious residents, Charles

MI. Wall, started his rise to become the acknowledged boss of most of

he illegal gambling in the Tampa and central aren of the State ol

Ie styled himself "flean of the underworld," and in 10533 he

admitted to a Hillsborough County solicitor that he ind made his liv-

ing from illegal gambling.

During 1915, Wall forfeited his leadership

by entering into a partnership with Santo Traflicante, Sr.

The elder Trafficante was born in Sicily in 1886.

He came to Tampa

n 190t and became a naturalized citizen in 1025. In 1950, he was one

state what he was retiring from.

April 1055, Wall's body was

found in his home.

Ile had been brutal beaten and his throat had

been slashed.

We have never discovered who the murderers were, nor

have we determined their motive.

Wall was murdered be-

cause the killers leurned ho had admired that he was Traficante's

partner in illegal gambling, and that he disclosed confidential facts

about the Mafia.

In 1960, Sergeant de la Llana obtained-from a confidential source

of known reliability an astounding report about the Mafia and its op-

cration in Tampa.

The report had been obtained from Charles Wall

in 1945, approximately 6 months after Traflicante, Senior, had made

himself a partner in Walls' gambling enterprises.

Wall declared that from 1920 through 1915 he controlled gambling

in Tampa and in the Florida counties of ITillsborough, Pinellas, Pasco,

Ternando, Polk, and Orange. His rival for control ot the gambling

rackets was the local Mafia organization.

This

was headed, he said

by Santo Trafficante, Sr., the Diecidue brothers, James Luma, Ignacio

Antinori and Salvatore Italiano. Antinori was murdered on October

22, 1910; Lumia was murdered on June 5, 1950; and Italiano fled to

Mexico in 1951.

Wall admitted that he had good reasons for going along with Traffi

cante, Senior, in 1945; previously the Maha group had made three at

tempts on his life: the first was in 1937 as Wall was leaving a bank on

the main street in Tampa; the second try occurred as Wall was leaving

the garage behind his house; the third, in 1040, happened a few blocks

from his house.

In the third attempt, a truck passed the automobile in

which Wall was riding and then stopped abruptly in front of the car.

James DeSimone and Nicola Impostato, FBI No. 2716692, each armed

stepped from the truck and fired at Wall and his

chauffeur.

DeSimone and Impo-

stato were known Mafia killers from Kunsas City, Mo.

They were

staying with the Antinori family at the time.

The CHurIAN. Is Wall still living!

Mr. BrowN. No, sir; he was killed.

The CHAIRMAN.

Later killed?

Mr. BROwN.

Yes, sir.

The CarriAN. These three attempts failed but later he was killed!

Mr. BROwN.

Yes, sir.

Wall declared that the Mafia tried to make the public believe that

the organization no longer existed in this country and that Mafia mem-

bers pointed to the end of terrorism umong Italian groups as evidence

that the Mafia was gone from the underworld scene.

however, that the organization had merely changed its type of opera-

tion.

He said that other racketeers

had once used the Mafia to

monopolize rackets in major American cities.

They had educated the

Mafia so well in the process that the Sicilians had taken over the rackets

themselves.

Wall stated that the Mafia learned to consider extortion

from Italian businessmen a

"nickel-and-dime" business.

discovered that public ficials could be corrupted by bribery hed that

they could organize to take over the major rackets in the United States.

Wall declared that the Mafia was not dying out, but "ras bigger

and better than ever."

Ile said that his partner, the elder Trafficante,

had told him that there were some 10,000 active Mafia members in

the United States.

Wall stated that the Mafia leader in Tampa was

Tradlicante had told him, Wall said, that the Mnfia

in the United States was directed by a local board in every city having

a sizable Sicilian population.

There was a national board, headed

by Joseph Profaci in New York City, which was composed of the heads

of the major local boards.

Traficante is reported to have said that

Frank Costello,

Vincent Mangano, and Joe Massie were influential

members of the national board, and that Frank Nitti and Lucky

Luciano were former members.

According to Wall's account, the Mafia was composed of to dis-

tinet groups, an "iner circle" and an "outer circle"

The general rule

was that only natives of Sicily were admitted to the "inner circle,"

while American-born Italians were recruited into the "outer circle."

The CunraAN. Those would only be in the inner circle so far is

the Tampa area is concerned?

Mr. Brown. That is right.

The CHAIRMAN.

Not in the inner circle overall?

Mr. Brown. No, sir; this is just in the inner circle in the Tampa area.

The CLAIRMAN.

But that gives an indication of how the overall

organization is set up.

Mr. Brown. That is correct.

The CHAIRMAn.

You may have it in here, but I may have missed

Mr. BROwN.

had Joseph Profaci's friendship.

ence to a national organization in the Mafia. Was it referred to ns

such?

Mr. Brown. This is the information as Wall has reported that it

consisted of a national board.

Senator Muskie. Do you know who he identified as members of the

national board?

Mr. BRown. Well, Joe Profaci and Vincent Mangano were two of

the members of the national board.

The CARIAN. They are shown to be leaders of families, both of

them.

Senator Muskir. But those same people are leaders of families in

New York as testified by Valachi.

NIr. BRowN.

Yes, sir.

The Cuss. So it is your impression that the heads of the New

York families made up a national board that had jurisdiction over

Tampa, among other places?

Mr. BRowN.

That is correct; yes, sir.

Wall declared that there were approximately 40 members of the

Mafia living in the Tampa area and he believed that

Traficante's

share of proceeds of their gambling operation was being divided with

other members of the Mafia.

Information in our files from another confidential source confirms

Wall's statement.

In addition it reveals that Antonio Diecidue made

annual trips to Miami for the purpose of renting a house for Vincent

Mangano, who came down froin New York every year to spend 2 or 3

months in Miami.

This source stated that many important members

of the Mafia visited Mangano in Florida, but that Traficante never

appeared.

Senator Muskir. May I ask another question on the national board!

Was it your impression that the national board members shared in

the proceeds of the criminal activities in Tampa?

Mr. Brows. Yes, sir; they had a percentage.

Senator Moskir. Have you any idea what that percentage was?

Mr. BrOwN.

No, sir; I have no idea.

The gray shadings on our chart depict the influence of each of

these men.

To me,

it appears to be no small coincidence that in

Tampa the Diecidue family lost stature from at least the early 1950's

when Vincent Mangano disappeared; nor that Trallicante, Jr., the

Profaci man.

was in the immediate vicinity, when Albert Anastasia

was murdered in 1957.

Mr. Brown. Our department has always found it a most dificult

task to obtain evidence sullicient for successful prosecution of Malia

members, because the witnesses who might offer such evidence have al-

ways been reluctant to do so.

The paramount reason,

of course, is

their fear of Mafia reprisals, since it is common knowledge in Tampa

that the Mafia does not hesitate to use murder for such reprisals and

ORGANIZED CRIME AND ILLICIT TRAFFIC IN NARCOTICS

Castellano said he was interested, and they agreed to meet

later that night.

At the meeting, Scaglione mas accompanied by Joe Mistretta and

Angelo LoScalzo.

Castellano got into the front seat of a car provided

by the others, and the four men drove to a thickly wooded area outside

of Tampa city limits.

Castellano was then attacked with a hammer,

being hit repeatedly on the head.

He managed to get out of the car,

although he was badly hurt.

He broke loose from his elderly assail-

ants and ran away.

Ile stumbled into a nearby house and asked to

be taken to the constable's house, where he gave a statement about

the incident, naming the three

as his assailants.

He swore to the

county solicitor that he had no idea why he was beaten.

Scaglione,

Mistretta, and LoScalzo were arrested and charged with assault with

intent to murder.

•Toe Custellano disappeared for a period of time.

After he tras

found, the case went to trinl.

Castellano changed his story completel

und testified that he had injured himself while hunting on the nigh

of the attack.

The predictable result, of course, was a verdict for the

defendants of "not guilty."

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FORTIER FEDERIL LEGISLATION TO FIGHT

ORGANIZED CRIME

I believe firmly that it is almost impossible for the Police Depart-

ment of the City of Tampa, or any other municipality, to cope ef-

fectively

with the activities of a national or international crime

syndicate such as these hearings show exists in the United States.

One of the main problems is that the most dedicated, well-trained,

and well-staffed police force is ahnost always limited legally and

financially

to the territorial boundaries of its municipality.

For

example, the Tampa

Police Department is obviously interested in

and informed about the activities of Santo Trallicante.

However, in

the past the department was unable to do anything about Trafficante's

operations in pre-Castro Cuba; it has no jurisdiction or control of

his illegal affairs in Minmi and elsewhere in central Florida.

department could only record that he attended the A palachin meeting

in November of 1057, but it could do nothing about this obvious evi-

dence that he was a high-ranking member of a national crime

syndicate.

In the light of our experience with the Mafia in our own city's

underworld, I submit for this subcommittee's consideration some sug-

post 1s to elem legislation which I betieve nile trint more

las enforcement agencies to fight organized crime

electively.

1. More ample funds must be obtained by local agencies to recruit

high caliber police personnel and to retain superior personnel having

the experience and eapabilities to understand, investigate, and prose-

cute organized criminal conspiracies.

interstate nature of organized crime, Federal legislation similar to

Could Rosselli Have Linked

Castro Plot to JFK Death?

By RON LaBRECQUE

. Herald Staff Writer

In 1960, when the CIA was try-

ing to set up a delicate attempt on

. the life of Fidel Castro, it turned to

a man once described as "the big-

gest flag-waving SOB in the coun-

try" -

West Coast underworld

figure Johnny Rosselli.

Rosselli - a seemingly improba-

ble conspirator

in a government

plot - got the "flag-waving"' label

from Salvatore (Momo) Giancana,

• then Chicago's top crime boss and

a man Rosselli brought into that

same plot.

Now both are dead, murdered in

the past year, and investigators are

wondering

whether their plotting

led to their deaths and whether the

CIA plots against Castro - only

recently made public and even kept

from the Warren Commission

Quatted

are Vitai clues to the John F. Ken-

nedy assassination.

The deaths of Giancana, in June

of 1975, and Rosselli, this summer,

have aroused a renewed concern in

Washington, where on Friday the

House of Representives voted to re-

open the investigation of the Ken-

nedy murder.

REP. THOMAS N. Downing (D.,

Va.), who will be chairman of the

panel, said he is "convinced" a con-

spiracy was involved in Kennedy's

death.

Now, in the aftermath of theevi

selli, the question arises of what

underworld figures to have Castro

murdered.

Whether the Kennedy? White,

House knew about about the CIA's

plotting (Robert F. Kennedy found

out after the contacts were ended),

the ClA's use of the underworld

seems ironic in retrospect.

Robert Kennedy's passionate ef-

forts to disable organized crime are

well documented.

wrote about what he had learned

Just to trace Rosselli's history

the investigators. Yet, it is just one

affair.

With Rosselli's 'death this sum-

mer, the newly

appointed Senate

committee saw its list of knowl-

edgeable

witnesses further trim-

med. Some of those witnesses have

died violently and some from natu-

ral causes.

When Giancana was murdered in

June of 1975, before he could even

be questioned by the committee

staff, authorities attributed it to an

internal gangland struggle - even

though. the murderer is still un-

known.

The death of Rosselli, who had .

appeared

- Baker,

vice

Committee, called for the FBI to

some: "high rollers" in would be

more profitable — it was Rosselli

•who patched things up.

Hughes

eventually

bought

the

Desert Inn, as well as the Frontier.

What Rosselli told the federal

grand jury about the Frontier in

1971 is unknown. Rosselli didn't:

testify later at the trial at which

Anthony J. Zerilli and Michael Pol-

izzi and the. Emprise Corp., among

others, were convicted.

ZERILLI and Polizzi are still in

jail. In 1973, the House

of Repre-

sentatives • Select Committee

on

Crime probed the influence of or-

ganized crime in sports - and one

area

they looked at was

Emprise

and the Frontier Hotel case.

At the time of the conviction, the

federal prosecutor asked that Poliz-

zi and Terilli be jalled immediately

because

monitored,

Wiretapped

conversations showed that the two

had talked about "murder, the kill-

ing of certain individuals."

• An intimate associate of Rosselli,

however, discounts the possibility

that Rosselli's grand jury appear-

ance could have led to his death.

"They know Johnny didn't talk to

the grand jury," the associate said.

JOE BREEN said Rosselli hadn't

been to Las Vegas for

nine years,

that "he's never even seen the gift

shop."

Since

prison

move to Plantation, Rosses ev agne

trying to regain

power; according,

to his friends.

"He had no muscle.'

said

an associate."I

can't believe

Rosselli was getting back into mob

stuff."

But at the same time, 'many of

the

associates

were

surpised

to

learn about Rosselli's recent visits

with alleged organized crime fig-

ures on the West Coast.

Several associates speculate that

Rosselli wanted to get involved in

casino gambling, preferably in the

Middle East, and

was looking for

someone with maney to back him.

"MY IMPRESSION was that he

was: broke,"' Morgan said.

"He told

me last year, 'I'm in bad financial;

" straits.''

Scheer said Rosselli's income in-

cluded about $60,000 from the gift

shop and about $3,500 in social se-

curity, most of which went for

back fees to attorneys and for gov-.

ernment fines.

One friend

said. that just before

Giancana's death, Rosselli had ac

cepted Giancana's offer of money.

The friend was to act as the inter-

mediary. "Let me figure out what:

my next (attorney's) tab will be,"

the friend quoted Rosselli as say-

ing.

Rosselli is described as a man

with a sense of humor who did lit-

tle offending.

A California

woman who had

known Rosselli for about 40 years

,told The Herald,

"If you

were:

around him for 30 minutes you'd

like him because he would regard

you as a human being."

"If you had a headache he would

either

get you an aspirin or send

someone to

get one. I said: some-.

thing significant there - he would

get it or he would send someone

he wasn't a pansy, but he wasn't a

tough guy either.
