This memorandum is being prepared pursuant to your instructions

following a call to your office by Mr. Edwin Guthman of the Department late

yesterday afternoon.

Mr. Guthman advised that the Metropolitan Police Department

regularly receives requests for press passes from newspapers throughout the

country so that their representatives may cover special events in Washington.

He said that the practice of the Metropolitan Police Department

in regard to these requests is to have Mr. Ben Gilbert, one of the editors of the

Washington Post, screen the names submitted to the police to make certain that

shey are not objectionable and are acceptable to the Washington Press Corps.

Mr. Guthman said that in connection with the 8/28/63 march on

Washington the police have received a letter signed by Eric Bert, managing editor

of "The Worker" in New York, requesting passes far several individuals allegedly

affiliated with the paper. This request was turned over by the police in- accordance

with their usual custom to Gilbert who in turn called Guthman to ascertain if it

was satisfactory with the Department for such passes to be issued. In connection

with these passes it is noted that the holders of such are allowed to cross streets,

police lines, and are given other courtesies normally afforded other working press

and not to the general public.

M. A. Jones to Mr. DeLoach Memo

RE: AUGUST 28TH MARCH ON WASHINGTON

All of these individuals, of course, are well-known communist

officials and we have prepared a brief resume as to their identity and background.

This is attached.

This attached data regarding these individuals has been furnished

to Guthman by your office:-Mr. Guthman has further been told that as far as

the FBI is concerned we can see no reason why they should have the requested press

passes or be furnished any other courtesies.

It was pointed out to Guthman that

the Communist Party, its officials and its members have defied the Attorney

General and the United States courts by refusing to register as directed under

the Subversive Activities Control Act. It was also stressed to Guthman emphatically,

however, that a final determination as to any action must be made by the Department.

RECOMMENDATION:

For your information.

The "Morning Freiheit" in its issue of August 18, 1963,

page 1, columns 1 - 3, continued on page 4; column 3, reported

that the Reform Rabbis, who are affiliated with the Union of American

Hebrew Congregations and the Central Conference of American Rabbis,

urged the members of their congregations to exert all their efforts

to help the Negroes in their struggle. for civil rights. It was

stated that these two organizations represent 650 Reform Temples in

the United States and their appeal was directed to over a million

members of these Temples.

In their appeal

the Rabbis called for the boycotting of all

companies, banks and businesses which practice discrimination against

the Negroes and urged participation in the march to washington on

August 28th.

According to instant article, the spokesmen for the Reform

Rabbis at a press

conference which was held on August 15, 1963, at

the "House of Living Judaism," 838 Fifth Avenue, New YArk City,

declared that in the march to Washington hundreds of Rabbis will

participate and they will carry signs with quotes from the Torah

which condemns the curse of race hatred and discrimination.

A characterization of the "Morning Freiheit" is

attached.

WORKERS WORLD PARTY

On April 17, 1959, a source advised that on

February 12, 1959, a Socialist Workers Party (SWP) minority

group under the leadership of National Committee member,

SAM BALIAN, split from the SWP.

The source stated that this minority group, referred

differences on varied issues concerning tactics and interpreta-

tion of political events, split from the SWP on the grounds that

the Party was liquidating itself by departing from the Marxist

precepts of LEON TROTSKY. and retreating from the fight for the

world

socialist revolution. The final issue which ultimately

forced the split was the minority's opposition to the SWP

regroupment policy which involved cooperation with-the Communist

Party (CP) periphery - individuals characterized by the minority

as petty - bourgeois.

The minority program, according to the source, advo- -

cates unconditional defense of

the Soviet Union and has

as its

goal the building of a revolutionary party with a complete

proletarian orientation for the purpose of overthrowing capitalism

in the United States and throughout the world.

On May 12, 1962, the source advised that this minority

group had chosen the name

Workers World Party:

On April 18, 1962, the source stated that the head-

quarters of the Workers World Party were located at 46 West 21st

Street, New York, New York.

The SWP and the CP have been designated by the Attorney

General of the United States pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

The aims of the club were put forth as

In its first issue,

dated March 3, 1963,

there was set forth a "Proposed Statement

of Principles" in which the aforementioned aims were elaborated

upon.

In this same issue of the "San Francisco News &

World Report," the lead editorial in part describes the W.E.B.

Du Bois Club of San Francisco

who are convinced that Socialism is the only answer to the

many problems of our time and so find philosophical rapport

with the life and thought of Dr, Du Bois, nevertheless we are

weighted with humility in comparing our goals and ambitions

with

the

genius of his life and work.

& source of

inspiration the figure of W.E.B. Du Bois is unequaled in

American history, but as a standard and example, we seem

miserably lost in his shadow.

We can only resolve that we do

his name no dishonor, and whatever we may accomplish should be

recognized as a supplement to his life work."

SYNOPSIS

the March on Washington scheduled for august 48,

1963, which has created nationwide interest, is being actively

supported by various legitimate nonsubversive religious,

fraternal, civil and labor organizations.

Current information developed as a result of our

Investigation of the Communist Party (CP), USA, activities™

does not indicate that this event was actually initiated by

lor is controlled by the CP. However, it is pertinent to

note that when Martin Luther King, Jr., one of the leaders

of the March, first conceived the

March on Washington, he discussed the matter with stanley Davic

Levison, a concealed CP member, and sought Levison's advice as

to whether the time was right for such a move.

Levison agreed

"The time is now." The lact that King consulted Levison

assumes additional significance in the light of information

He received from a source who has furnished reliable infor-

mation in the past to the effect that in May, 1962, a national

functionary of the CPUSA commented that Stanley levison, by

reason of his association with the Martin Luther King movement,

was doing the most important work in the variy at tnai time.

With respect to Levison's Party connection, we received

Information in June, 1963, that although he still has strong

communist convictions and

still acts as an effective Party

advisor to King, he has become critical of the Party's role -

in the civil rights movement. Levison said he does not

consider himself to be under

• the control of the Party with

respect to his dealings with King.

The Party is actively supporting the March, in

spite of its awareness of a public statement by leaders

of the March that they did not want "any communists."

CP

support of the March is manifested by endorsement of the

March in the communist press to foster the illusion that

the CP is a humanitarian group acting in the interest of

the Negro, and by Party leadership urging rank-and-file

CP members to clandestinely participate in the March.

This clandestine participation is a Party tactic which

is apparently being used in order not to alienate the

organizations sponsoring the March since the Party views

this event as a golden opportunity to reach a growing

powerful mass movement for Negro civil-rights.

The Party plans to distribute openly its literature,

including 10,000 copies of a planned special edition of "The

Horker," east coast communist newspaper, to March participants

in various locations outside of Washington, D. C.

In addi-

tion, the Party hopes to sell 10,000 of its pamphlets. No

distribution of Party literature

D. C., in deference to public announcements by leaders of

distributed in Washington during the March.

Coverage of communist activity in connection with

the March is planned at present through six Bureau security.

informants who are coming to the March with local groups.

American communists in Mexico are supporting the

March, including the collection of funds for the purpose of

sending telegrams to March on Washington headquarters.

Endorsement of the March has been announced by the

Socialist Workers Party (SWP) (cited as subversive under

Executive Order 10450) and instructions calling for partici-

pation have been issued by the wörkers orla Party (WWP), a

splinter group of the SWP. No information has been received

to indicate that Elijah Muhammad, leader of Nation of Islam

, or NOI members plan to

march as individuals.

CP leaders have stressed the fact that the March

is not the be all and end all in itself.

Events which sub-

sequently flow from the March will be of utmost importance,

such as following up on contacts now being made by CP members

working in support of the demonstration.

Utilizing the

March, the Party has three basic general objectives:

(1) Participation by CP members through legitimate

organizations.

(2) Attempt to get the Party line into the hands of

sympathizers and supporters of the March through

distribution of "The Worker" and Party pamphlets.

(3) Utilize the March as a steppingstone for, future

Party activity through contacts now being made

by Party members involved in the March.

It remains to be seen to what extent the Party will

be successful in translating its efforts stated above into

concrete results.

DETAILS

Utilization of the March to Further Aims of the Communist Party

The march on washington scheduled for August 28,

1963, is an event which has created national interest and

is

being supported by such nonsubversive organizations as. the

American federation of state, County and Municipal Employees,

Catholic Interracial Council, State Association of the Elks

and the Greater Philadelphia Council of Churches.

The

Communist Party (CP), USA, although it did not initiate nor is

it controlling the March,

is using this event for the purpose

of promoting its own interest.

It is pertinent to note here, however, the conversa-

tion Martin Luther King, Jr., one of the March

with stanley David Levison, a secret member of the Party, on

IJune 1, 1963.

It is known to us that Levison and King have

foeen in contact with each other since December, 1956. As

early as September, 1958, Levison was descrived as ons of king's

Chiel assistants who spent considerable time advising and

helping King At one time, Levison and his brother, who is

snown as Roy Bennett, were

N

ie "Party-

and in past years Levison and his brother, Roy Bennett, both

have been heavy linancial contributors to the CP.

During the

afore-mentioned conversation, King commented he had never seen

the Negro community as aroused,

as determined, and as enthusi-

astic as at that time.

He said that "We are on the threshold

oi a significant breakthrough and the greatest weapon is mass

demonstration." King added "We are at the point where we can

mobilize all of this righteous indignation into a powerful mass

movement." King suggested that there be a mass march of literally

thousands and thousands of people on Washington. King said that

even the threat of such a march might so frighten the President

that he would have to do something. He asked Levison "Are we

ready for that." In reply, Levison said two things would have

to be considered: (1) There would have to be unanimity among

all groups. (2) Would more pressure be generated on Washington

by a series of local situations rather than by one mass march

on Washington. King answered at length and was in favor of one

He said he envisioned such an event would create

such an impact that "something would have to give." He again

that "something

asked Levison if the time was right for such a move. Levisor

then agreed "The time is now."

in the conversation,

ta to do society for ten at mans asses tepant

proposal with Roy Wilkins, Executive Secretary, NAACP, and

A. Philip Randolph, President of the International Brother-

hood of

Sleeping Car Porters, before any amouncement is

made publicly concerning a mass march on Washington. At

that point,

King suggested that either Levison or Jones

see A. Philip Randolph and that a statement be worked out

along the lines of the new militancy throughout the

country.

During the discussion, it was indicated that.

Clarence Jones

had attended a meeting at which the

National Council of Churches had expressed an interest in

King's direct action approach.

Levison asked Jones whether

it would be possible to quote individuals without mention-

ing names who had attended the meeting as "this is new

when white church leadership is looking for something in

the way of direct action."

Levison

said this would give

it the biggest, broadest front ever as "you can see the

effect of Negroes joined by the National Council of Churches

and not just Negro churches."

The significance of this

conversation is apparent when consideration is given to the

fact that when King first was considering a march on

, Washington, he discussed it in detail with his contact in

the CP and sought the advice of this communist as to whether

the time was right for such a march. Additional significance

can be attached to this. conversation; in the light of

information we received from a source who has furnished

reliable information in the past to the effect that in

May, 1962, a national functionary of the CPUSA commented

that Stanley Levison, by reason of his association with the

Martin Luther King movement, was doing the most important

work in the Party at that time.

Information received in

June, 1963, indicated that while Levison still retains his

strong communist convictions and still acts as an effective

Party advisor to King, he is becoming critical of the Party's

role in the relationship. He believes the Party has lost

prestige among Negroes lately because it has not been

sufficiently aggressive and effective in promoting civil

rights for the Negro and otherwise immersing itself in

Negro causes. Levison said he does not consider himself to be

under the control of the Party with respect to his dealings

with King.

on august 2, 1963, CP-leaders In New York City-

stated that the leaders of the March have not invited the

Party to participate and in addition have publicly stated

they did not want

"any communists."

and stated that "we" have to see in this the opportunity

I to build up friends with the objective of bringing

into the Party.

the possibilities inherent in this march as seer

by the Party are indicated in a statement made by Gushalt,

CP tenoral Sacrotany. in speaking

• to approximately 70

communists or communist sympathizers in Philadelphia,

D. C

N

Pennsylvania, on July 31, 1963.

He described the March as

an indication of a peaceful transition toward socialism and,

according to Hall, it is imperative that as many white :

people as possible participate.

On August 2, 1963, Hall

commented that the Party should not give the appearance that

it is "taking over." (Along this line, Party leaders in

, early August, 1963, urged rank-and-file CP members to

clandestinely participate in the March through legitimate

organizations.

N

At a meeting of leading CP functionaries, New York

City, August 14, 1963,

PhilyBart, CP National Organizatior

Secretary, stated that there never has been a comparable figure

in the past wherein hundreds of communists will actually be

together with tens of thousands of others, as will take place

in the March. Bart called for efforts to work with the idea

of, establishing connection with this new force. At this same

meeting, Joseph Brandt, CP national functionary, commented that

- 3b -

HH 55180 Do0Id:32989649 Page 128

## Page 129

the Party has blended itself into this "movement" and,

because persons in the March will be listening to our people,

the question now arises as to what can be done with these

people after the March.

From information we have received, it is apparent.

the Party anticipates that participation by its members in

this event, which it feels is of great historical significance,

will subsequently be used as a vehicle to reach a new massive

force. Association with March sympathizers could well serve

as components of a luture picture painted by the Party,

\ featuring itself as the champion of the Negro cause.

Party Program

As early as June, 1963, some semblance of a Party

program began to jell and was outlined in an article appearing

in the June 23, 1962, issue of "The Worker."

This article

suggested a program based on a report adopted at a recent

national gathering of communist leavers.

It called for:

(1) direct, mass, peaceful action pursued through the Negro

people and

their organizations; and (2) the support vi white

allies, beginning with organized labor. Included in the

proposals were the withholding of Federal funds from states -

which deny constitutional rights to its citizens; a petition

to the Supreme Court to set a time limit of January 1, 1964,

;for compliance with its 1954 decision on the desegregation of

public schools; and, if necessary, the federalization of the

State National

Guards.

By July 15, 1963, the Party had issued two directives

"TO ALL (CP) DISTRICTS." One referred to an article in a

recent issue of "The Worker" by James Jackson, which identified

the "Dixiecrat" politicians and the "Northern

Republican ultra-

Rightists" as the enemies of the Negro movenent. The "Directive".

urged Party members to order reprints of this article for mailing

to influential figures in Negro organizations, trade unions,

fraternal orders and churches.

The other "Directive" urged

Party support of the March, which it described as "an event of

the greatest historic importance."

At a meeting of leading CP functionaries in

New York City on August 1, 1963, William Albertson, member of

the CP National Board, stated that the Party must show the

Participation of Rank-and-File Party Members

While leaders of all major Party districts discussed

participation in the March on Washington, actual organized par-

ticipation is receiving its largest support in the New York City

and Philadelphia areas.

In New York the 1lth Assembly District CP Club, which

had been advised that the CP should not be directly identified

with the March but should participate in other groups, was

making arrangements by August 7, 1963, for rail transportation

to Washington. Five members of

the Club pledged their attendance.

Three members of the CP Peace Club, Brooklyn, New York, planned to

participate in the March and will travel to Washington

by train

with a group from the 17th Assembly District, Brooklyn, New York.

On August 7, 1963, it was reported that 100 members of

whose leadership consists largely of communists, will go to

Washington by train.

(ICC), which was initiated and founded by the CP of Eastern

Pennsylvania and Delaware in October, 1962, decided on July 22,

1963, that it would take up the task of contacting people who

would not be contacted by the National Association for the

Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and CORE. The ICC pledged

In Detroit on July 17, 1963, Cart Winter,, CP Function-

ary, advised that the Party is not happy with President Kennedy'™

speaking out in favor of the demonstration since this will

insure its peacefulness and diminish CP participation.

In late

July, 1963, William Allan, CP member, Michigan, stated that

every Party club organization should try to recruit for the March

and he hopes to see at least one chartered bus and several car

loads of marchers from the west go to Washington.

In Chicago, Illinois, Claude Lightfoot, Chairman 01

the CP in Illinois and a National Vice-Chairman,

stated in early

August, 1963, that the CP of Illinois is attempting to get 500

white persons to go to Washington.

In Los Angeles, California, at a meeting of the

Jewish Commission, Southern California District CP (SCDCP),

on August 5, 1963, a recommendation was made for the SCDCP

to send a representative to Washington on August 28.

BenfDobbs.g

Executive Secretary. SCDCP, had stated on July 30, 1963, that

the SCDCP would not directly support the March by paying

transportation costs due to lack of funds.

The Virginia CP State Executive Committee on July 14,

1963, proposed that work should begin on getting a delegation

to go

to Washington as participants or as onlookers.

In Seattle, Washington, the CP leaders of the Central

District Youth Club are attempting to raise money with an

apparent objective to cover expenses of bus transportation for

a group to attend the March.

According to a source, NAACP

-

leaders in the State of Washington are having nothing to do with

the communists.

Use of Party Literature

Much attention has been given the use

of Party.

literature and a special edition of "The Worker" is being

planned in connection with the March. Stachel, on August 7,

1963, proposed to leading CP functionaries that "The Worker'

and other literature be distributed to delegations to the

March.

This was accepted but with the qualification that

no distribution would be made during progress of the March.

Louis Weinstock, General Manager of "The Worker," who originally

planned to go to Washington on August 27, 1963, with 1,000

copies of "The Worker" in the trunk of his car, proposed, on

August 14, 1963, that 10,000 copies of "The Worker" be distrib-

uted at bus and

train terminals since there is to be no

distribution in Washington, D. C.

He also proposed that 10,000

pamphlets be sold at concentration points on the morning of

August 28, 1963, and the remainder be sold after the demonstration.

Support of March by American Communists in Mexico:

A group of American communists in Mexico are working

actively to support the March. They have revived temporarily

a defunct

organization known as thelleague for Defense of

Negroes and have been collecting funds to send telegrams of

encouragement to the Washington headquarters for the March.

Individuals in the group are writing the telegrams and

attempting to secure on them the signatures of well-known

persons in Mexico. To date, they have succeeded in obtaining

the signatures of a number of prominent personalities./

mexit:

' Including that of the former Mexican President, Lazaro Cardenas.

Haywood Hall, described as one of the most militant members of

the group, reportedly has left Mexico City already with

intentions of joining the

March, and Albert Maltz, one of the

well-known

"Hollywood Ten," reportedly also plans

to travel to

Washington to take part in the demonstration.

FBI Coverage of CP Participation in March

Calif

Six security informants from various offices are

scheduled to attend the March.

These informants have been

Instructed to promptly furnish the Washington Field Office with

all pertinent developments pertaining to communist efforts to

influence the March.

Subversive Connections of Certain Leaders of March

Certain leaders of the March have some subversive

connections.

This has been covered in a separate memorandum,

Scatterday to Rosen, dated August 20, 1963, captioned "March on

¡ashington, August 28, 1963, Summaries Re Principals Involved,"

mcopyat which is

Participation of Other Subversive Groups

The Socialist Workers Party (SHP), designated under

Executive Order 10450, at its National Convention in July, 1963,

officially endorsed the March as part of its policy to link

the SWP with the struggle of the Negro people.

The Workers

World Party (WHP) issued instructions that all individuals

attending the Lorthcoming national WWP conference in

New York City should participate in the March. The WWP split

from the SWP in 1959.

While there may be members of the Nation of Islam

(NOI), an all-Negro, antiwhite cult which seeks separation of

the races, participating in the March as individuals, as of

August 14, 1963, there were no indications that Elijah Muhammad,

the leader of the NOI, planned to be in Washington on that date

or that the NOI planned to participate in the March in any way.

It is anticipated members of the NOI in Washington

may attempt to sell copies of "Muhammad Speaks," NOI newspaper,

during the March.

valuation of Party Influence and its Utilization of the March

Realizing that plans for the March on Washington are

obviously being carried on successfully by other organizations,

the Party is making an all-out effort to take advantage of this

opportunity to further its cause. The Party has three basic

l objectives:

(1) Participation by CP members through legitimate

organizations

(2)

Attempt to get the Party line into the hands

of sympathizers and supporters of the March

through distribution of "The

Worker" and

Party pamphlets

(3)

Utilize the March as a steppingstone for

future Party activity through contacts now

being made by Party members involved in the

March

It remains to be seen to what extent the Party will

be successful in translating its efforts stated above into

concrete results.

APPENDIX

PROGRESSIVE LABOR MOVEMENT

A source advised on January 15, 1902, that at

a meeting

of the MILTON

ROSEN faction

Peat y Ivania, on January 11, 1962, it iS pointela,

that this group was in touch with

Communist Party (CP)

former CP members in various cities throughout the

United States hoping to convene a National Conference in

the summer of 1962 for the purpose of establishing a

National MARXIST-LENINIST organization.

"The Worker," an East Coast Communist newspaper,

Issue of January 7, 1962, page 10, column 3, reported the

expulsion of MILTON ROSEN, former Labor Secretary of the

New York State CP, from the CP.

A second source advised on July 2, 1962, that

Progressive Labor groups held a conference in New

York

city, on July

•*1, 1962, where MILTON ROSEN acted as chair-

man.

He read a statement at this conference setting forth

their intention to form a new MARXIST-LENINIST party in the

United States. ROSEN stated that a more formal organization

was necessary,

one which would provide a framework for all

who wanted to join in a united effort to build an American

vanguard. The functions of this new organization are to

include:

consolidation of all existing forces around

•Progressive Labor and organizing additional forces; expand

and improve political activities; win additional forces to

an outlook of MARXISM-LENINISM and increase the open advocacy

of socialism; develop a significant MARXIST-LENINIST program

for the new party; and organize a collective organization of

leaders and members.

A third and fourth source advised in February, 1963,

that this new MARXIST-LENINIST party has not yet been

organized on a formal, basis, but that Progressive Labor

groups had been formed in several localities in line with

proposals of MILTON ROSEN.

The sources advised as of

February, 1963, that the leaders of this group are

referring to it as the Progressive Labor Movement.

MARCH ON.

MASHINGION

AUGUST 28, 1963

Assistant Attorney General John Douglas telephoned me

last evening.

He said, as we know, he had been assigned by the

Attorney General to assist the Deputy Attorney General in

coordinating matters for the Department in connection with the

March on Washington scheduled for August 28, 1963.

Mr. Douglas stated that he had become concerned on reading

several memoranda from the Bureau relating activity on the part of

Communist Party members in connection with the narch. Douglas noted

that he frankly has no idea what action the Department should take

in this regard. He said he was, therefore, contacting us for any

advice which we might have.

This matter has been discussed with Assistant Director

Sullivan and we are in accord that great damage would be done to the

cause of the Communist Party if the Negro leaders of the August 28thg

march came out forcefully denouncing the communists and rejecting-

their support.

This would be a blow to the Communist Party since

It would forestall later propagandizing of their efforts in support

of the Negroes and the demonstration.

There are leaders in the Marca

on Washington. movement who have consistently opposed the communists,

such as, A. Philip Randolph, President of the Negro American Labor

Council

and Roy Wilkins, Executive Secretary of the NAACP.

- Public denounciation of the Communist Party by responsible&

Negro leaders at the time inmediately- preceeding the March on

Washington, when public interest is high,' would undoubtedly result

in nationwide publicity.

Our future ability to investigate the

Communist Party would not in any way be alphardized by this action...

ACTION TO BE TAKEN

• EX 104

RE##+ 1 57-97051037

If you approve, Mr. Douglas will be recontacted and it

will be suggested to him

that the Department might desire to, on a

confidential basis, inform the responsible leadership of just what

the communists are

trying to do relative to this march, In order

that these communist efforts may be publicly denounge 48 1963

SAM BALIAN, split from the SWP.

The source stated that this minority group, referred

to as the Marcyites, after many years of program and policy

differences on varied issues concerning tactics and interpreta

tion of political events, split from the SWP on the grounds that

the Party was liquidating itself by departing from the Marxist

precepts of LEON TROTSKY and retreating from the fight for the

world socialist revolution.

The final issue which ultimately

forced the split was the minority?s opposition to the SWP

regroupment policy which involved cooperation with the Communist

Party (CP) periphery - indíviauals charâuverize by the minority

as petty - bourgeoise

The minority program, according to the source, advo

existence

The Central District Youth Club (CDYC) came into

around the lst of May, 1963. It originally con-

sisted of about twelve members,

several of whom were

related to EDDIE GIVENS. The membership has grown to more

than thirty-five and has broadened to include young people,

for the most part, tho vere attracted to it as a result of

pubiicity concerning its activities. The majority of members

have no connection whatsoever with the CP and are not aware

of the fact that CP members are leading the group.

The officers of the CDYC are believed to be EDDIE

GIVENS, Chairman; RAY COOPER, Vice Chairman; and CARLYN KING,

" Secretary

RAy mas commeuted on several casions that it

is very difficult for CP leaders to put their program

across to the group because the members of the group lack

political maturity. Activities of the CDYC, therefore, are

often imstigated by the group and followed by the CP leaders.

Some of the activities of the CDYC include art

classes conducted by MARGARET COOPER, who is not a CP member.

' EDDIE GIVENS, RAY COOPER (husband of MARGARET COOPER) and

CARLYN KING are members of the Communist Party.

The purpose of the CDYC is to develop the political

awareness of the people involved in order to broaden the mass

movement

toward Socialism.

Memorandum Baumgardner to Sullivan dated 8/ 22/63 set

forth information pertaining to connunist influence and participa ow

tion in the March on Washington 8/28/63.

The purpose of instant

memorandum is to bring the Director up to date concerning the

Party's latest plans with respect to this March.

..!:

Gus Hall, leader of the Communist Party (CP), USA, has

now decided to participate in this March. Hall plans to partic-

ipate quietly and with no publicity. As

an example of the Party's

desire to participate in the March under a veil of secrecy, nine

Party functionaries, headed by James E. Jackson, Editor-in-Chief

of "The Worker,". east coast

communist publication, are attemoting

to gain accreditation as "press representatives" of "The Worker.

rather tall as are patepant w

Information available to us as of 8/27/63 indicates that"

excess of 100CP members plan to participate in this March.

While the majority of these individuals will come from the New York

and Philadelphia areas, individuals in such widely scattered areas

as Buffalo, New York; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Detroit, Michigan;

Chicago, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Denver, Colorado; States

of Oregon and Washington; San Francisco and Los Angeles, California;

/ and the New England area plan to attend.

Information received on 8/22 and 23/63 indicates that it

has been rumored among Puerto Rican independentists in New York City.

that the New York Junta of the Nationalist Party o1 Puerto Rico

(NPPR) (designated pursuant to Executive Order 10450) desires to

have one of its adherents participate-in the March and to join the

March leaders who will be received by the President.

If successit,

this adherent, in the presence of the President, would attempt to

create some unspecified type of disturbance to publicize NPPR demands

for a free and independent Puerto Rico.

Information concerning the

NPPR has been furnished to the local Secret Service by our Washington

Field Office and was promptly telephoned to Mr. John Nolan, Administra

tive Assistant to the Attorney General.

? - promote peaceful co-existence between

the U.S. and Russia.

3 - promote and encourage Marxist doctrines

and to bring about a socialistic govern-

ment in the U.S.

This

In its first issue,

dated March 3, 1963, there was set forth a "Proposed Statement

SECRET

without receiving the Investigative attention 1t required.

Based on information available to your office, the importance

Of this meeting and appropriate coverage thereor are obvious:

Your office is well aware that levison, a secret member of

the Communist Party, gravitated to King, a recognized leader

Of and spokesman for millions of Negroes, some time ago.

Levison has applied dedication to the communist cause by

expending prodigious eftorts in King's behalf. This has

reached the point where king now consults with and depends

on Levison for guidance.

King has recently adopted the pre-

cautionary measure of avoiding direct contact with Levison

and instead consults with hin by using Clarence Jones, an

attorney, as an intermediary. (S)

The Bureau considers this to be one of the most

important cases in the New lock Office at the present time.

A number of recent communications fron the Bureau have served

to impress upon your office the urgency and importance being

attached by the bureau to all aspects relating to the Inves

tigations concerning captioned and related natters.

SAC

Letter 63-50 (1) dated 10/1/63 is but one example of these

communications.

This case should be the responsibility of ASAC Boney.

You are theretore instructed to obtain fron ASAC Roney his

personal explanations as to the reason this meeting was not

covered. His explanations should set forth what quidance he

has riven to this matter,

as well as what remedial steps he

intends to take to prevent a recurrence of this situation.

In addition, explanations of other responsible

personnel should be obtained and subritted along with your

personal recommendations as to administrative action.

it is important to have the information that revolved around thie; the involve-

ment of these people, what information we have, whether fleeing from looting

or what is going on.

He asked it there is any infernation available.

Memorandum for Messrs. Tolson, DeLoach, Rosen, Sullivan, Bishop

have a demonstration today and the Guardsnes are present, but they have

been blocking Highway No. 1 most every day. I said very fortunately,

they have arrested and charged three of the leaders for the damage done

to the Adrainistration Building when they went in the other night and broke

the furniture, et cetera

The Vice President said what he wants to be able to do is bring

out some fects the media conveniently overlookedi

I said they never give

the things that are being done constructively, many times by studeuts, to

try to prevent this, but they eraphasine all the things these jerisa are doing.

The Vice President said he sar a picture about Augusta showing

some of the Negroes jumping out of store windows with loot and bocty and

fleeing and you never hear anythiny about that. he said whatever i can cive

him that can ameliorate some of the impact; that he understande some of

these things are wrong and me are probabir going to find some of the shootings

showed too much force, but none the lass, the people have to understand

the very thrust of the nemspaper articles is that a bunch of police shot down

six Negroes and what haupened before - why did they shoot at them -- not

just because they feit like killing people. I said they were severely provoked

at kentand we will finish Augusta, Atlanta, and Jackson this week.

I told the Vice President I was sending to hizz fednesday, the

material Kent Crane asked for, which gives in sumwary the material we

have sent in detailg

The vice President said he thought he was going to have to start

destroying Abernathy's credibility, so anything I can give hira would be

appreciated. I told him I would be glad to. Lead i was the only one who

spoke out against slartin Luther King and I got hell, but I did not give a damn

because it is more like bouquete than brickbats froz some people. The

Vice Fresident said we canit let demagogues become roartyrs and teroes.

I said I had brieied the Appropriations Committce about his (Sing's) back-

ground and it has been effective recently because they have been trying

to the Committee and they have, in turn, bricied some of their colleagues,

but I will see that he, the fice President, gets the details even beiore we

finish the reporte

The Vice President said he would like to be thoroughly conversant

with all of that because if the crisis comes where we need to throw it he

will. I told him i rould pet it over in the next 24 to 48 hours as to the high-

Q.C.

Pursuant to the Director's instructions, a speech by

Abernathy, the President of the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference, on 5/18/70 in New York City was covered by the New York

Office. Essential information regarding the speech is included in

the attached letter to the Vice President who requested to be

advised regarding Abernathy's activities.

In connection with the coverage of the speech, it is noted

that the field offices involved, Atlanta and New York, both did ex-

cellent work in learning of the location of the address on short

hotice.

New York's work was especially noteworthy in securing a

source who was able to cover the meeting. Atlanta was able to

ascertain discreetly that Abernathy was not in Atlanta but was in

New York City to speak before a meeting of Baptist ministers. The

Location of the meeting could not be obtained in Atlanta on such

short notice. Although there was no public advertising of the

meeting, New

York found'

that Abernathy a speaking beto ground a baby mattes

at 3PM. New York was able to secure'a source who could blend into

this type meeting and equipped him with a recording device to tape

the address.

12 MAY 22 1970

Abernathy, in a highly emotional speech, called for the

unification of black churchmen in the Ü.S. and for a reexamination

of their nonviolent attitude.

He implored them to take a more

positive position in the racial struggle and beseeched them not to

Identify themselyes with the late Martin Iwher King, Joi

as the

nonviolent struggle in the U.S. was dying out.

He cited the recent

shootings in Augusta, Georgia, and Jackson, Mississippi, as reasons

for believing that nonviolence is dying.

He accused Governor Lester

Maddox of Georgia of giving local police, state police, and the

National Guard wholesale authority to slaughter black people.

Jackson State College, Jackson, Mississippi, and in Augusta and

Athens, Georgia, as well as information concerning a proposed mass

march to Atlanta, Georgia, symbolizing the deaths of six Negroes

in the Augusta disturbance, have been prepared and are attached.

These memoranda set forth summaries of information

available at this time as to the events that took place in the

disturbances in the three cities. At Jackson, Mississippi, the j

disorder began on the night of 5-13-70 when a

crowd of 100 Negro

students, later joined by 600 other persons, including hoodlum-types,

engaged in extensive vandalism and rock throwing at white-occupied

motor vehicles. Disorder erupted again the following night with

numerous reports of sniper fire and attacks on police resulting in

gunfire by the police. The gunfire left two Negroes dead and ten

others wounded.

Riotous disorder in Augusta, which erupted 5-11-70,

involved sniping, looting, and arson by crowds of rampaging Negroes

and resulted in the deaths of six Negroes before order was restored.

The disturbances in Athens, which occurred on several

days in the latter part of April and early May involved several

firebombings and acts of disorder by young Negroes protesting the

RACIAL DISORDER AT

JACKSON STATE COLLEGE,

JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI

MAY, 1970

the Jackson State College, a state-supported

coeducational Negro institution with a student body of

approximately 5,000, is located in the Negro area of

Jackson, Mississippi, about one mile from downtown Jackson.

This college has been the scene of student a sturbances

in past years.

In recent months sources of this Bureau

have advised that many students at the school had acquired

firearms and were retaining them in their dormitories. The

Dean of Men reportedly expressed his concern in this regard

to a gathering of students several weeks ago.

On the night of May 13, 1970, a crowd of approximately

100 students, protesting United States

involvement in Cambodia

and chanting antiwhite slogans, gathered on Lynch Street,

which intersects the main campus, and threw rocks and bricks

at passing motor vehicles occupied by white persons. One

motorist and one bystander were injured. The crowd subse-

quently increased to about 700 persons, made up mostly of

students.

According to a source, a number of black hoodlum-

type youths, many of them "high" on liquor or narcotics,

joined the students in the disorder. Members of the crowd

threw objects at Negro campus police officers and at campus

buildings, causing extensive window damage to dormitories and

classrooms. Numerous pistol shots reportedly were fired into

the air and at some buildings and motor vehicles by mob members.

The disturbance was brought to a halt at about 2 a.I., May 14,

Racial Disorder at

May, 1970

-

Disorder again accurred on the night of

May 14, 1970, when a crowd of about 60 Negroes, including

many nonstudents, assembled near Alexander Hall, a girls'

dormitory which faces Lynch Street. Members of the crowd

renewed their attacks

on white-occupied motor vehicles

with rocks and bricks.

A source advised several tavern

owners roceived anonymous telephone calls at this time

urging them to spread the rumor that Mississippi civil

rights leader Charles Evers and his family had been killed.

By 11:30 p.m. the disorderly crowd had grown to over 200.

A dump truck was set afire and police units moved into

the area to clear the crowd to enable the fire department

to extinguish the blaze.

Police reported that from the time they arrived

in the area they

were subjected in abusive language and

became targets for rocks and bottles from the crowd of

Negroes.

Police also reported sniper fire coming from

Stewart Hall, a men's dormitory also Incated on Lynch Street.

A newsman reportedly stated that while Inllowing a fire

truck on foot he heard a volley of shots and was told the

shots were coming from a sniper located between two school

buildings. One officer claimed he heard six small caliber

shots in the area of Stewart Hall at the time the truck

fire was being extinguished.

At about 12:15 a.m., May 15, 1970, a large

contingent of city police officers and state troopers in

riot gear, carrying rifles and shotguns, who had moved

on to the campus reportedly was approached by a mob of

about 200 students near Alexander Hall. The police fired

three tear gas canisters at the crowd forcing it to retreat.

The crowd, however, again came tovard the police line

hurling bottles and other objects, at which time the police

allegedly opened fire. In witnesses stated they heard

the crash

ni a bottle and one small gunshot or firecracker

just betore the police fired. One officer reported that

at about the same time he saw a muzzle Ilash in a window

of Alexander Hall and another officer stated he saw a

streak of fire emanate from a top window of another

school building. Police reportedly entered Alexander Hall

where they allegedly fired several shots.

As a result of the gunfire two Negroes, Phillip Gibbs,

age 21, a Jackson State College student, and James Earl Green,

e high school student, died. Ten other Negrnes were wounded,

three critically. Five Negines, as well as three state

troopers and iwo

Jackson poiice

nificers, suffered other

forms of injuries, minor in nature.

Two additional arrests of Negroes were made on

the night of May 14, 1970, one being charged with carrying

a concealed weapon and the other for assaulting a police

officer. Property damage in the two nights of disorder

• from vandalism involving extensive window breakage has been

estimated at $8,000 to $10,000. Some windw breakage and

damage to walls was also reported as a result of the gunfire.

A contingent of about 400 National Guardsmen who

had been on standby in the area aided police in restoring

order shortly after the gunfire had ended. A group of about

100 students went to the residence of the college president

and demanded to see him but upon his refusal, they dispersed

and caused no further disturbance.

Complete details regarding the disorder at

Jackson State College and the circumstances surrounding the

shootings are not yet available. State and local investigations

MAY 11-12, 1970

On May 9, 1970, a 16-year-old Negro male,

Charles Oatman, being held in the Richmond County Jail,

Augusta, Genigia, for the March 31, 1970, gunshot slaying

of his five-year-old niece was beaten to death by two other

Negro juveniles incarcerated in the same cell.

On the evening of May 10, 1970, local authorities

advised that a group of approximately 300 Negroes led by

Negro City Councilman Grady Abrams and a "Committee of Ten,"

a group of local Negro citizens attempting to take a more

active part in heiping Negro juveniles and the poor of

the community, appeared at the County Jail seeking an

explanation of the death..

The demonstrators dispersed

without incident after the Sheriff of Richmond County

furnished an explanation of Oatman's death to the group.

On May 11, 1970, approximately 400 Negroes,

primarily teen-agers, led by Abrams appeared at the Richmond

County Municipal Building demanding improved conditions

at the Richmond County Jail specifically relating to the

handling of juvenile prisoners. When the Sheriff presented

Abrams and his group with a list of plans worked out with

the Chairman of County Commissioners toward the improvement

of the handling of juvenile prisoners, Abrams appeared

satisfied with the solution.

The local pastor of a Baptist church then spoke

to the crowd stating that they were not there for violence.

He then indicated that it was time for the crowd to disperse.

_While the demonstrators were in front of the Richmond

At approximately 5:30 p.m. local authorities

reported that some of the demonstrators had reassembled

and nonblacks. Local authorities also reported that

rioters overturned and burned numerous cars and tricks.

By 9 a.m. on the morning of May 12, 1970, approximately

1,000 Georgia National Guardsmen were on duty in the city

of Augusta where they had been called by Georgia Governor

Lester Maddox.

On May 12, 1970, the Richmond County Coroner's

Office furnished the ages of the six Negroes killed

during the rioting: 45 years, 39 years, 28 years,

20 years, 19 years, and 18 years. Police authorities at

Augusta reported that the Negroes were presumably killed

in an exchange of gunfire between snipers and police.

At a meeting of the City Council on May 12, 1970,

the Mayor of Augusta read the following demands made

by

Negro leaders in Augusta in connection with the riot:

1. Amnesty for all arrestees.

2. Blacks in policy-making positions in city

and county Government.

3. Positive minority hiring practices.

4. Investigation of county and city penal systems.

5. Community relations committee to be set up

with subpoena powers.

6. Positive effort by city and county to recruit

black investors along with private industry.

7. Periodic meetings of officials to ascertain

problems and moods of community.

Reportedly the Mayor of Augusta took the above

demands under advisement.

Councilman Grady Abrams and another member

of the "Cornittee of Ten," however, stated they were not

satisfied with the Mayor's response. The biggest demand

of the Negro leaders was for amnesty for all individuals

arrested during the disorder. The Mayor agreed to make an

effort regarding the amnesty grant but indicated that

Individuals arrested on State charges were beyond his

control.

During the evening hours of May 12, 1970, local

authorities reported minor isolated sporadic outburstg

of violence in Augusta but there was no organized effort

to repeat the previous night's violence. One 17-year-old

Negro male looter was shot and wounded during the evening

hours of May 12, 1970. At 4:45 a.M. on May 13, 1970, the

Augusta Police Department reported that all was quiet in the

city with only a few arrests for curfew violations and

intoxication.

On May 18, 1970, an official of the Augusta Police

Department advised that preliminary information received

during the rioting, three were shot by police while looting;

two others were tound in the street by police alter being

The Chief of Police in Athens, Georgia, advised

that Negro youths in Athens reportedly are dissatisfied with

the manner in which the predominantly Negro Burney Harris

High School is to be closed to conform to integration

mandates this coning school year.

During the evening hours of April 29, 1970,

approximately 175 Negro youths marched through the downtown

area and several windows in business establishments were

broken by the demonstrators, causing an estimated damage

o8*$1,000. Une Negro temale was arrested for disorderly

conduct.

During the evening of April 30, 1970, about 100

Negro youths assembled near a Negro housing development and

began throwing rocks at passing autonobiles. Police

authorities ordered the youths to disperse, however, they

ignored the orders and continued the rock throwing and began

running into the street in an effort to interfere with

traffic.

Damage was estimated at $1,000.

Seventy-three

Negro youths were arrested for unlawful assembly.

Later

during the evening, two Negro adults were arrested near the

Burney Harris High School in possession of four Molotov

cocktails and charged with criminal possession of incendiaries.

Harris marched from a church to the downtown section and

back to the church, where they dispersed. This demonstration

was conducted with a permit and no incidents occurred. The

of the resentment on the part of some of the students that

Burney Harris be closed to conform to integration requirements.

MILITANT STATEMENTS MADE BY

RALPH DAVID ABERNATHY,

PRESIDENT OF THE

SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE

Abernathy purports to advocate nonviolence but

has made a number of statements which, while not directly

advocating violence, certainly invite violence. Examples

of these statements

follow.

In May, 1968, at the beginning of the Poor

People's Campaign, a massive march on Washington, D. C.,

sponsored by the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference,

Abernathy told an audience in Atlanta, Georgia, "I don't

want anyone to expect me to be Martin Luther King, JI. I

to the Nation, to the United States, with Ralph Abernathy

you've got hell on your hands." In the same month in

Birmingham, Alabama, Abernathy said, "Under Doctor King we

were just going. to rock the boat, but under the leadership

of Doctor Ralph Abernathy, I'm going to goä step farther.

We're going to turn this Nation upside-down and right side

up. "

In May, 1969, at a speech in Atlanta, Georgia,

Abernathy referred to an unpaid bill for generations of

Irresponsibility, oppression and neglect. He said, "The bill

is going to be collected - willingly or unwillingly, in

civilized decency and love or in fear and hate and the flames

of destruction. Time is not running out, but rather, time has

run. Öut."

MILITANT STATEMENTS MADE BY RALPH DAVID ABERNATHY,

PRESIDENT OF THE SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN. LEADERSHIY CONFERENCE

According to the Chicago Tribune August 30, 1963,

Abernathy addressed 3,000 peace demonstrators in Grant Park,

Chicago, Illinois, on August 29, 1968, during the time the

Democratic Convention was being

held in Chicago. He referred

to police officers as "pigs" as black extremists regularly

do and said that nothing was taking place on the Convention

I100r.

He then added, "But the Lord knows It.fs happening here,

and more will take place because: we are going to sock it

to 'em, baby," referring to clashes which had already occurred

between demonstrators and police.

In May, 1969, apparently angered at what he

considered a poor reception received by his poor people's

delegation from the Nixon Administration, Abernathy said time

was running out on nonviolence as an approach to solving the

Nation's problems. He said, "I do not know how muuhilönger?

nonviolence can be effective in this country. If the Nation

fails to display some consideration (for the people), then I

tremble for my America." He added that if the litor Administration

fails to hear nonviolent voices, then they will have to listen

to violent voices.

In September, 1969, while speaking in Atlanta,

Georgia, Abernathy said the country is "on the verge of political

repression and possibly even bloody revolution." He warned

that "there is a limit to people's endurance of injustice and

America is rapidly approaching that limit.".

On August 13, 1969, Abernathy emphatically embraced

and endorsed a plan for counseling young men to refuse to be

drafted into military service. The plan was presented to the

Annual Convention of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

in Charleston, South Carolina.

Abernathy's inconsistency in his nonviolent posture

is matched by the same attribute in the personal conduct of

this preacher.

MILITANT STATEMENTS MADE BY RALPH DAVID ABERNATHY,

PRESIDENT OF THE SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE

On the night of August 29, 1959, Abernathy

dashed from his church office in Muntgomery, Alabama,

pursued by an irate husband wielding a hatchet who accused

Abernathy of having a relationship with his wife. The

wite of the assailant told a Montgomery Circuit Court jury

In November, 1953, that she had submitted to unnatural sex

acts with Abernathy before her marriage, beginning at the

age of 15, and that "He never stopped chasing me" even

after her marriage. She had been a member of Abernathy's

church.

The jury reportedly deliberated only ten minutes

before acquitting the husband of charges

xe needly

in connection with

his attack on Abernathy

During the Poor People's Campaign in Washington, D. C.,

Abernathy was headquartered at the Pitts Motor Hotel in

Washington, D. C., while his followers were mired in the mud

In Resurrection City, a shantytown near the Lincoln Memorial.

This became a point of contention among his followers and on

one occasion Abernathy slept at Resurrection City. However,

he returned to the Pitts Motor Hotel during the night after

suffering 'stomach pains."

Abernathy has supported the violence-prone Black

Panther Party. In the latter part of 1969 he made several

public statements favorable to the Black Panthers. On

April 20, 1970, Abernathy urged liberal and progressive forces

to join a rally on behalf of the Black Panthers at New Haven,

Connecticut, on May 1, 1970.

RACIAL MATTERS

To advise Of possible violence in New.Haven,

Connecticut, in connection with the trial of BPP National

Chairman Bobby Seale, charged in the murder of Alex Rackley,

a BPP member suspected of being a police informant...

NK 605-R*|learned on 4/5/70 that Jon Turner in

New Ilavell talked to an unknown woman in Berkeley, California,

and told her he would be in New Haven about three weeks to do

something about Bobby Seale being "framed" into the electric

chair. He said his education and skills would be useful and

told

her that Dave (not further identified) would bring Turner's

"stuff" in Dave's briefcase on 4/6/70.

Chief of Staff, left Los Angeles on 4/5/70 for New Haven:

Turner told the woman to listen for news from New Haven in the

nest few weeks because it would be interesting.

According to the source, Turner again called California

on 4/14/70 and instructed that Shelley Bursey, a BP memper who

works on the Panther nevspaper, bring him his

"black bri:e fcase"

when she comes to New Haven.

The source added that a "big thing"

is planned for 5/1/70, a "giant May Day celebration, -

" details'"

inot yet decided. Jon Turner is a San Francisco subject and is

i¡considered a bombing suspect because his clothes contained

information on explosives when he took them to be cleaned.

The New Haven police and Secret Service in New Haven

have been advised concerning Turner and the possible violence.

Investigation of Turner and Bursey is being intensified and

we are attempting to learn the contents of the briefcase being

carried by Bursey. New Haven is preparing a comprehensive letter-

The BPP national headquarters has promised the

New Haven Chapter all the support it needs in preparation for le irf

upconing murder trials involving BPP National Chairman Bobby

Seale and other Panthers.

Reportedly, all chapters throughout

the United States have received instructions to send members

to the arca with an emphasis being placed on those having

training in the use of explosives. Numerous Panthers, including

Elbert Howard, the Deputy Minister of Information, have already

arrived and Howard has stated that "The people are ready, just

waiting for the word." A massive rally has been planned for

May 1, 1970, and thousands of individuals, induding BPP members,

i the New Left, students and various coalition groups are expected

to participate. The BPP states that "big things" are planned

during this rally.

Large purchases of guns, ammunition and explosives have

been nade for transportation to New Haven and a New York BPP

member has been placed in charge of a team of specialists in

demolition and fircarms. A bombing suspect of the Berkeley,

California, Police Department is in New Haven and is assisting

in this regard.

Current emphasis by the BPP is being placed on shutting

(NH airtel 4/15/70 re BPP

Counterattacks and Annihilate

Similar inflammatory themes have been featured in

recent issues or

"The Black Panther," weekly BPP newspaper.

For example, BPP Minister of Information Eldridge Cleaver,

who is a

lugitive Iron justice and sell exiled in Algeria,

wote n the Maich T isoue:

"Te, Diacs peupie, if we are

forced to go it alone, must be prepared to unleash the ultimate

political consequence

upon this racist nation.

The ultimate

political consequence which Black people have in their power

to unleash is RACE WAR....This is the political consequence

which America faces because of this unspeakable evil attempt

to murder Chairman Bobby Seale in the Electric Chair." The

April 18 issue contains instructions for cleaning shoulder

veapons,

for Iirearms training, and for making Molotov cock-

tails and hand grenades.

This issue also carries a comment

by Randy Williams on the jailing of David Hilliard and BPP

Minister of Culture Emory Douglas In New Haven for contempt

of court. Willlams, who is in custody of the Dakland,

California, Police Department for "unprovoked ambush and

wounding of" four Oakland police officers on April 17,

1970, wrote: "Counterattack by any means necessary.

Fascist

Anerica will soon dread the birthday and curse the name oi

the Lascist pig judge in Connecticut....ORDERS: Destroy the

spirit of the fascist forces; seek out and annihilate them

Wherever they are found."

Shoot to K111

The New Haven SPP chapter's "People's News

• Service"

picked up the theme of race war in its April 5 issue

when it

stated:

But when niggers take to the streets it's shoot

to kill. When pigs go after Panthers 1t's destroy a11,

kill all. The only solution to our problem is dead pigs

from the three levels of oppression, the demagogic politicians,

avaricious businessmen, and the racist pig cops."

In this

connection, a rumor was spread through the ghetto area of

New Haven that Arnold Markle, State's Attorney who is

prosecuting the BPP case, will be murdered if Seale is

convicted.

Another rumos calls for the kidnaping of someone

in the office of the Attorney General of the United States

who would be held for the release of Seale if Seale is

convicted. (NH it 3/26/70 re BPP; SF it 4/6/70 re BPP)

"Glant May Day Celebration"

There are other ominous signs.

Jon Turner, BPP

activist from the West Coast is in New

Haven. Turner, who

as viewed as a possible boubing suspect by the berkeley,

California,

Police Departmer, has toid west coast associates

that his education and skilis would be useful in New

and that a "big thing," a "giant May Day colebration" is

planned for May 1 in New Haven.

Turner added that in

New Haven things are "uptight," the community is mobilized,

and its going to get hot.

Elbert "Sig Man" Howard, BPP

Deputy Minister of Information, has also mentioned

a rally

in New Haven on May 1, and has said that even school children

In New Haven are determined to keep Bobby Seale from the

electric chair.

At a rally held at Yale University on

April I4, Howard stated that the black community

• "must meet

kidnaping with klanaping; killing with killlng." If the

Panthers are convicted, Howard predicted, "You will have a

Flood of crazy niggers

in your streets."

Trouble at Yale

As for Yale Univorsity, the campus is tense as the

Panthers go all out to get student support, Tarlier this

month, albert howard wanted Robert Scheer, Lorner editor of the

rabidly anti-United States magazine, "Ramparts," to come to

New Haven to lead a three-day strike at Vale University and

to demand of Yale $500,000 10r the "Bobby Seale Defense Fund."

Panthers in New Haven are distributing pamphlets, brochures,

and "The Black Panther" widely on the Yale campus to rally

support. On April 20, David Dellinger of the New Mobilization

Committee to Ind the War in Vietnam and Reverend Ralph Abernathy

SF IRET

of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference held a press

conference concerning the mass rally scheduled to be held in

New Haven on May 1, 1970, and said they expected support

from Yale students.

An unidentified Negro told a group of

Vale students on April 17, "If you don't close Yale down in

two weeks, we have the means to do it ourselves." On the

night or Aor 1 21, the Vale Student Senate agreed to "a vote

for a volun try strike to express concern for justice and

the rights" of the Panthers charged with the murder of

Alex Racktry. On April 22, about 80 per cent of Xale's

students wie on strike. (NH tts 4/16, 17, 20/70 re BPP)

Weapons and Ammunition Stockpiles

The volatile statements and threats of the Panthers

cannot be dismissed as more rhetoric or propaganda.

It has

been reported, for example, that Robert Webb, New York City

Panther,

has been placed in charge of a team or specialists

in demolition and firearms. A Meriden, Connecticut, police

officer apprehended six young Negroes on April 8 after a gun

shop had been burglarized.

On the previous night, 19 weapons

were solen from the same shop. there is ample reason to

believe that these stolen weapons were to be delivered to the

BPP in New Haven®

Furthermore, Boston Panthers have been

purchasing arms and large quantities of ammunition for

delivery to New Haven.

The purchases, the bulk of which

were made on April 17, Included live rilles, one shotgun,

one carbine, and nearly 30,000 rounds of ammunition,

including 23,000 rounds for high-powered rifles. (NH to 4/9/70

re BPP; Boston it 4/20/70 re BPP)

violence. In view of the many threats of violence made by BPP leaders in th

event Bobby Seale is convicted of murder, law enforcement agencies in

New Haven are making special preparations to handle any violence that may

occur. The chief cause of concern at the present time is the massive rally

which the BPP and its sympathizers are planning for 5/1/70, which activity

may continue for several days. The chief of the New Haven

Police Department

advised today that current plans call for utilization of 200 police officers on

duty on a continuous basis from 5/1 through 5/3/70. Three hundred Connecticut

State Police officers and 700 National Guardsmen will assist. In addition,

there will be 1100 National Guardsmen on call who can be mobilized within a

2.-hour period. •

Reports of stockpiling of weapons by BPP members continue to be'

received. These reports have been to effect that members of BPP are prepared

to buy large amounts of weapons and ammunition for use by New Haven Panther

Defense Committee in the upcoming "revolution." Police in Boston report

that Ber members or sympathizers there hake mosce purchases of rities,

! shotguns, handguns and large quantities of ammunition-for use in New Haven

Weapons in possession of the Panthers reportedly include automatic weapons.

On 4/23/70 an official of the United Nuclear Corporation in

Memorandum for Mr. Sullivan

RE: THREAT OF RACIAL VIOLENCE

NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT

"United Illuminating, Olin Mathiesen, and United Nuclear would be bombed out. "

He stated he had alerted officials of these companies as well as the Atomic

Energy Commission and local authorities.

Information was received in February that dynamite was located

at BPP headquarters in New Haven. Recently a source advised that at least

two members of each BPP chapter in the country (BPP organizations

are located in about 40 cities) should proceed to New Haven and that preference

I should be given to members having explosives and demolition experience. .

Violent statements by BPP leaders have already caused minor

disturbances in New Haven. Following the jailing of two BPP officials on

contempt of court charges during preliminary proceedings in the BPP trial

on 4/14/70, a group of blacks broke windows and created disturbances in

downtown New Haven. Several days later, a group of about 300 high school

students, most of them Negroes, who had been demonstrating in front of

the courthouse ran through the downtown area shoving and pushing shoppers

and damaging property. On 4/22/70, a local BPP leader created a disturbance

at a high school forcing the temporary closing of the school when fires were

started and windows broken by rampaging students.

Reports indicate BPP gaining support of Yale University student

groups. Leaders of the BPP have been active on the Yale campus where

many of their threats of violence have been voiced. They have indicated

they expect strong support from Yale students in the 5/1 rally and have

threatened to close Yale down if a demand of $500, 000 from the University

'to be used in defense of Connecticut Panthers is not met. A threat was made

to take over the rare book library at Yale.

On 4/22/70, ten of twelve undergraduate colleges at Yale voted to

strike in support of the

Panthers. Yesterday approximately 500 striking

students staged a march to the residence of the University president and

then held a brief peaceful rally. A peaceful "civil disobedience" demonstration

called for by Yale Chaplain William Sloane Coffin, Jr., during which Coffin

and otherswould subject themselves to arrest scheduled to be held on 4/24/70

has been postponed to be held, according to Coffin, in abeyance for possible

future use.

Memorandum to Mr. W. C. Sullivan

RE:

THREAT OF RACIAL VIOLENCE

NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT

Yale University law library damaged by fire.

Yale University.

has been the scene of much of the activity by BPP leaders

in the New Haven situation. In connection with the recent

demand for $500,000 from the University, threats were made to.

close Yale down and to take over the rare book library.

Yesterday, a fire of

suspicious origin caused considerable

damage to

the basement of the Yale law school library.

The

damage was confined mostly to books and heavy smoke damage

to the upper portion of the building.

Facilities allegedly to be provided by Yale University during

the demonstrations•

It has been reported that Yale University

is providing medical aid through medical stations located on

the campus.

Most of the colleges at Yale are arranging for

housing in rooms and temporary shelters for the use of the

demonstrator's.

Food will also be provided by the University

at a price of 20 cents per meal.

Hartford Courant, a Hartford, Connecticut, newspaper stated that

Powell previously held a press conterence

at the Bradley

International Airport in Hartford, stating that the "New Haven

Panther trial is high on my list of issues to discuss.

The

Black Panther Party are good friends of mine, all of them."

He also stated, "I'm proud of them and I'm proud of the fact

that we have an

armed band of blacks.

FBI Chief J. Edgar Hoover

lis the architect of the genocide of the Black Panther Party."

ACTION:

Pertinent information with regard to the above is

being furnished by teletype to the White House, the Vice

President, the Attorney General, Central Intelligence Agency,

Secret Service, and military intelligence agencies.

Washingion, D. C.

Dear Mr. Nassikas:

I thought you might be interested in the

following infornation concerning the, increasing activity

of the extremist and violence-prone "Black Panther Party

in the New England area which poses a potential threat

to electrical power installations throughout the country.

The Black Panther Party is currently engaged in

a massive campaign in New Haven, Connecticut, in support

of Its Chairman Bobby Seale and other Black Panther Party

members who face trial there for the killing' of a fellow

Panther in May, 1969. The main propaganda phase of this

campaign is that Seale is a political prisoner who 1s

being railroaded to the electric chair. The Black Panther

Party claims that he will never be electrocuted because it

will turn off all the electricity and let the flame of

liberation light the sky. This theme of shutting off the

eleccricity is continually preached by the Black Panther

Party in speeches by

its members and in the articles and

cartoons appearing in its newspaper, "The Black Panthar,"

Approximately 139,000

coples of the newspaper are being

printed each

Honorable John N. Nassikas

Although this threat against electrical power

systems appears to be pure propaganda at present,

it is

quite possible that individual members of

this extremist

organization could be incited to committing a destructive

act against a power installation. You will, of course,

be advised of any specific threat developed in this regard.

For your additional information, there is

enclosed herevith a Current Intelligence Analysis dated

April 24, 1970, which contains details of the Black

Panther Party campaign currently underway in New Haven,

Upon removal of the enclosure, this letter

becomes unclassified.

Sincerely yours,

J. Edgar Hoover

NOTE:

See memorandum G. C. Moore to W. C. Sullivan dated

4/27/70, captioned "Black Panther Party, Racial Matters,"

prepared by ABF:bjr. Classified "Secret" because the enclosure

is so classified.

The enclosure is so classified because it

contains information from confidential sources and sensitive

investigative techniques, the disclosure of which could adversely

affect the national defense interests. Information in the letter

1s from public source data.

try to place sympathizers in positions in law enforcement and

commit burglaries to obtain firearns and lunds to further BPP

Counterattack and Annihilate

Similar inflammatory themes have been featured In

recent issues of "The Black Panther," weekly BPP newspaper.

For example, BPP Minister of Information Eldridge Cleaver,

who 1s a fugitive Irom justice and self-exiled in Algeria,

wrote in the March 7 issue:

"ie, Black people, ii ve are

forced to go it alone, must be prepared to unleash the ultimate

POTENTIAL FOR VIOLENCE DURING

DEMONSTRATIONS IN SUPPORT OF

BLACK PANTHER PARTY DEFENDANTS

NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT

A.

Géneral Situation

Many signs indicate that the possibility for racial

violence, acts of destruction, and even

assassination in New

haven, Connecticut, is increasing sharply.

The basis for

this is the all-out effort being made by the extremist Black

Panther Party (BPP) to make Nev Haven a center of operations

for the BPP and a rallying point for black extremists and

white radicals in order to whip up aupport for BPP National

Chairuan Bobby Seale and other BPP members who are facing

trial on a murder charge.

Many outside groups, including a

large portion of the Yale University student body, are

lending support to the BPP,

and reports disclose that these

groups will undoubtedly participate in massive demonstrations

which are scheduled to take place in New Haven for several

days beginning on May 1, 1970. A source advised on April 26,

1970, that an individual not known to him had informed the

national headquarters of the BPP that 50,000 persons would

take part in the demonstrations in New Haven next weekend.

B. Threats of Violence

On

March 18, 1970, BPP Chief of Staff David Hilllard,

in an address before 2,000 persons at the University of

Connecticut, threatened that 1f anything happens to Seale,

"There will not be any lights for days in this country...Not

only will ve burn buildings, we will take lives, ve will blow

up buildings, we will kill judges..."" He stressed what was

expected of young white revolutionists in these words, "If

they feel that they want to do what they have already

• been

doing in terns of explosives, then they should do that.

they want to assassinate judges, they should do that.

If

you don't want black people to just go out in the street and

indiscriminately murder white people or vice versa, then I

think it's necessary for us to come together around the issue

of trying to free Bobby."

Hilliard said

"We're going to unleash

& race war on the pigs of America and it's up to you as

white

revolutionists to support the struggle of black people."

Similar inflammatory themes

have been featured in

recent issues of "The Black Panther," weekly BPP nevspaper,

and in Ministry of Information Bulletins prepared by the

Connecticut State BPP.

Examples of this are included in

-the attached copy of Ministry of Information Bulletin,

Number 15, which, among other things, contains a photograph

of the

Chief of Police at New Faven with the caption "Wanted

Dead." Reportedly, 10,000 to 12,000 copies of these Bulletins

are distributed throughout the State of Connecticut, as well

as in New York City and Boston, Massachusetts, weekly. The

April 18 issue of "The Black Panther" carries an article by

Randy Williams who wrote, "Counterattack by any means necessary.

Fascist America will soon dread the birthday and curse the

name of the fascist pig judge in Connecticut...ORDERS:

Destroy

the spirit of the fascist force; seek out and

annihilate them

wherever they are found."

C: Stockpiling of Arms and Ammunition

On April 21, 1970, a source advised that he had been

contacted numerous times by John LaPort, a member of the New

Haven Panther Defense Committee, requesting that he be prepared

to buy large amounts of weapons

and ammunition for use by the

New Haven Panther Defense Committee in the upconing "revolution."

He indicated he had $3,000 with which to purchase weapons.

According to reports from sources, BPP members in

Boston, Massachusetts, have been buying guns and large

quantlties of ammunition in recent weeks for use in New Haven.

John Pinderhughes, a Boston Panther, has been one of the

largest purchasers of ammunition in

the Boston area.

The weapons reported purchased have included five

rifles, one shotgun, and one carbine.

The ammunition purchased

has included 4, 400 rounds of .30 caliber, 1,700 rounde of 8mm,

880. rounds of

44 caliber, and 150 rounds of .00 buckshot.

source reported that the ammunition purchased by Pinderhughes

was delivered to BPP headquarters in New Haven on April 20,

1970, by James Wilson, a white male who has been involved in

BPP activity.

A source advised on April 22, 1970, Johu Wayne Thomas,

& Boston fanther, had made it known that he is trying to obtain

magazines for automatic weapons and

said he has 75 Sm automatic

weapons.

A report was received by the Connecticut State

a company in Newington, Connecticut, over the weekend. No

suspects in these thefts have been developed.

On April 26, 1970, a source advised that Douglas

obtain 100 sand bags for use at

obtain 1,000 "bags" as quickly as possible as

"a matter of

iife and

death," stating "they" had to get "the stuff prepared

by Iriday." The source was unable to learn the specific nature

or purpose of the "bags."

D. Use of Explosives

The use of dynamite and other explosives by BPP

members and their sympathizers in the New Haven situation

is a strong possibility.

Information was received in February

that dynamite was located at BPP headquarters in New Haven.

A source advised on April 16, 1970, that Robert Webb, a New

Xoris Panther, has been placed in charge of a tean of specialists

in denolition and firearms.

Another source reported that the

BPP recently issued

instructions for at least two members of

each BPP chapter in the country (BPP organizations are located

in about 40 cities) to proceed to New Haven in connection with

the Panther murder triat, and that preference should be given

to members having explosives and demolition experience.

Jon

Turner, a black extremist from Berkeley, California, who is

& bombing suspect of the Berkeley Police Department, was

recently in New Haven, reportedly to ald in the activity

there by utilizing his

skills as an explosives expert.

Indications are that he will roturn to New Haven.

A source reported on April 19, 1970, that he had

been informed that two members of

the Weatherman faction of

the Students for 2 Denocratic Society (SDS) will be lurnishing

dynamite to the BPP and their cause.. On April 27, 1970,

at a party attended by people in "the movement" in New York City

on April 24, 1970, an individual named Lee Doyle, who is employed

at a chemical warehouse in New Haven, has stated

he plans to

individuals coming into that city will be able to store expio

sives and weapons to be used in the demonstrations beginning

way I, 1970.

Doyle reportedly stated that he was obtaining

liquid nitroglycerin and will be able to furnish it to anyone

who needed it.

conversation among six Negroes at a barroom in New Haven who

James K. Hernes, who

had been expelled for radical activity,

was arrested.

Gregory Wells, aged 22, was also arrested.

Both were charged with possession of explosives with intent

to destroy property and persons.

. Demonstrations Scheduled for May 1, 2, and. 3, 1970

A chief cause of concern in the Now Haven situation

at the present time is the massive rally which the BPP and

its sympathizers are planning for May 1, 2, and s, 1930.

Kepores indicate that 30,000 to 50,000 persons are expected

Such activity over this extended period could

well result in confrontations between the demonstrators and

The radical groups planning to join the large number

no doubt that the situation is fraught with danger. Groups

which have indicated that they will participate include SDS

Security Measures Being Taken by Local Law Enforcement

Agencies

: Lay enforcement agencies in the Now Haven area are

making special preparations to control the demonstrations

during the ibree day period from hay l through s, 1970.

The

Chiet of the New Haven Police Departnent has advised that

current plans call for the full utilization of his 425-man

police force. Sixteen-hour shifts will be worked during the

period with two thirds of the force on duty at all times.

Three hundred Connocticut State Polico officers and 700

National Guardsmen will assist local authorities. In

addition, there will be 1,700 National Guardsmen on call who

can be mobilized within a two-hour period.

In view of the possible attempts to free the BPP

nenbers awaiting trial in Ney Haven, extra security guards

will be on duty at the State Prison in Montville,

Connecticut,

and Women's Prison at Niantic, Connecticut, were the BoD

members are contined.

Both of these cities are approxi

mately 50 miles east of New Hayen.

The police department has established an

Intelligence Center where 17 telephones on direct lines will

be manned at all ilmes. About 40 undercover police officers

with valkie-talkies operating fron strategic concealed

places will act as - spotters, during the period of the three

day activity.

As a special security measure against the use of

explosives, all manhole covers in New Haven have been welded

down.

Special police personnel will be assigned to guard

strategically located business establishments as well as

the police department,

G. Reaction of Local Citizens to the Demonstration Activity

The population of greater New Haven Is approXi-

mately. 350,000 people.

The population of New Haven itself

is approximately 150, 000 people, 40 per cent Negro.

Indications are that the local responsible citizenry, black

and white, is extremely concerned about the situation and

that lt; vill remain clear of the demonstration aren, where

possible.

Il. Disorders Which Have Already Occurred

Minor violence has already occurred in New Haven

•as a result of activities of BPP members. On April 14, 1970,

folloving the jailing of two BPP officials on contempt of

court charges during preliminary proceedings at the EPP

trial, a group of Negroes broke windows and created disorders

1u downtown New Haven®

Several days later, a group of ebout

3uo high school students, most of them Negroes who had been

demonstrating in front of the courthouse, ran through the

downtown area shoving and pushing shoppers and damaging

property. On April 22, 1970, 2 local DPP leader created a

disturbance ai a high school, forcing the

temporary closing

of the school when fires were started and windows broken by

rampaging students.

On April 27, 1970, a fire or suspicious

origin caused considerable damage to the basement of the

Yale Law School Library. The damage was contined mostly to

books and to the upper portion of the building caused by

heavy smoke:

On April 26, 1970, police observed an automobile

occupied by two women

and a

man driving by police headquarters

several tines and then stopping at the rear entrance of the

building. One of the individuals vas arrested for a traific

violation and the other two for trespass. A search of the

car by police revealed literature concerning the BIP rally

and also a map of the City of New Haven on which several

locations, Including National Guard armories, a shopping

mall, the

office building housing the fBI office, and the

Yale

University bowl had boen marked. Also found in the

I. Conclusions

I. Based upon the current intelligence relected

• In this paper, the potential for violence is extremely high.

-The assessment in this regard pertains not only to the

possibility of police confrontations and rioting, but also

takes Into account assassinations, bombings, arson and

sabotage against key facilities.

2.

The Departmental Civil Disorder Task Force

should proceed to New Haven on instructions of the Attorney

General

and Deputy Attorney General for instant deployuent.

3. Taking into account the high potential for

violence of all kinds, the decision with respect to alerting

Federal

troops will be taken

into consideration by the deputy attorney

General in connection with his neeting with appropriate

military authorities.

4=

Responsible agencies, both local and Federal,

should maintain close and continuous liaison throughout

this crucial three-day period with particular attention

being given to the protection of vital facilities and

Installations, including Government buildings which may

become targets for extremist elements.

To recommend that the attached teletype be sent to all

offices, except Anchorage, Honolulu, and San Juan, alerting them

to the high potential for violence at New Haven and to instruct

that immeciate contacts be made with informants and sources to

insure that appropriate coverage is afforded this matter.

A continuous flow of information regarding the grave

and increasingly high propensity for violence at New Haven,

Connecticut, is being received. The steady influx of militant

excremists, both black and white, into the area

to take part in

demorstrations and related activity to commence 5/1/70 to show !

support for Black Panther Party (BPP) members charged with

murder has continued. This, accompanied by intelligence infor-

mation indicating that many of these extremists are intent upon

committing acts of violence, appears to underscore the necessity

to send reliable informants to the area. Also, it would appear

that sympathy demonstrations which could result

vioLence may occur on campuses or in cities in other parts

of the United 'States.

ACTION:

It you approve, the attached teletype to all offices

except Anchorage, Honolulu, and San Juan will be sent in

accordance with the above.

RE:

DINCNSTRATION ACTIVITY IN

SUPPORT OF BLACK PANTHER

PARTY MEMBERS FACING TRIAL,

NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT

Current Davelopments:

Tre demonstration activity in New Haven started today

shortly after noon with a press conference on the New Haven Green

during which David Hilliard, BPP Chief of Staff, and Elbert Howard,

BPP Deputy Minister of Information, and several

members of the

"Chicago 7," including Abbey Hoffman and David Dellinger, spoke.

An estimated crowd of 1,000 persons were present.

Hoffman made

the statement "If they do anything to Panther headquarters, we

will bring it out into the streets." Dellinger, on the other hand,

staied "We" should not have violence because the Government is

promoting violence and wants to cover up the true purpose of the

demonstrations by creating violence.

The press conference lasted

about 1 hour and 15 minutes and no violence was

reported. About

30 members of the violent Weatherman faction of SDS

were reported

earlier to be on the Yale campus with Abbey Hoffman, who was

"preaching fire."

‚Connecticut Hall on the Yale campus is being

,used by the Boston, Massachusetts, SDS contingent.

As of 1:30 P.M. the estimated number of individuals who

hạd arrived in New Haven to participate in the demonstrations was

4, 000. The demonstrators are continuing to arrive from New York,

New Jersey, and other points. One group from Washington, D.C., is

reportedly on its way to New Haven carrying 50,000 "Free Bobby Seale"

leaflets prepared by a Washingion radical newspaper. The New York

Conmictee to Defend the Panther 21 in New York City paid $7,000 for

the chartering of 32 bises yesterday which were being used to

transport persons to New Haven.

A source reported that 75 members of a Hartford, Connecticut,

Black Panther group and the Blackstone Rangers,

a Hartford youth

gang, are attempting to secure trucks and buses to come to New Haven

and these individuals are reported to be armed.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

A source who has furnished reliable information in

the past attended a "Revolutionary Action on Campus and In

Community" workshop at the Black Student Revolutionary

Conference (BSRC) which was held at Yale University, New Haven,

Connecticut, May 16 - 19, 1970. This conference was held

under the direction of the Black Panther Party (BPP). At the

May 18, 1970, session of that workshop, at least 100 persons

were present and the group appeared to

be made up of four

factions. Two of the factions were white and one of those

consisted of the extremist Students for a Democratic Society

Weathermen. The other two groups were representatives of the

black extremist BPP and the Black Student Union (BSU).

BPP leader Douglas Miranda and two BPP representatives

from California spoke at that workshop.

Speakers encouraged students at the workshop to

withdraw their savings from banking institutions and invest

those funds in the necessary arms and material for revolution.

It was stated that an underground should be formed by students

from all states. It was said that intelligence files should

be kept on all black policemen and daily reports kept on their

activities so that they may be judged by the people and tried

at a later date:

It was pointed out that maps should be made pin-

pointing all emergency shelters, hospitals, fire stations,

reservoirs, railroad terminals, airports, telephone installa-

tions, and utilities. It was noted that guerrilla units

should be organized and developed to operate against trans-

portation facilities, radio and television stations, and

public utilities. Those units should consist of people who

are ready to die and are explosives experts, snipers, and

cameramen.

It was suggested that welfare mothers stockpile

canned goods and that defense groups seek weapons and bombs

for a people's arsenal. Mention was made of an underground

strike center which should be set up with security clearance

necessary for all who enter or leave. Such a center would

be used by only the most trusted personnel of the people's

army.

It wa's proposed that names and addresses of all public

officials, city and state, be recorded and classified so that

they can be readily "moved on" if necessary.

A second source who has also furnished reliable

information in the past advised that as individuals arrived

in New Haven on May 16, 1970, for the BSRC, they went to the

BPP Defense Office where they registered and were assigned

rooms.

As part of the activities of the BSRC, the second

source advised that at about 8:30 PM on May 18, 1970, there

on their campuses. One unidentified student from Staten Island,

New York, Community College ¡ mentioned that gun clubs were

being organized on his campus as well as other

campuses and

he urged that blacks be influenced to join them. He pointed

out that college libraries have a wealth of information on

guns which is available to all.

According to the second source, another series of

speeches was given at the BSRC on May 19, 1970. One of the

speakers

at that time was BPP member Richard Moore who stated

that when the BPP sends out a call to go to Washington, D. C.,

he wants everyone there

to help "repaint the White House."

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

One of our Black Panther Party sources, who was in

New Haven, Connecticut, on May 1, 1970, during the massive

Black Panther Party demonstrations at Yale University, has

been debriefed and has furnished the following pertinent

information.

It was the source's observation that the Black

Panther Party in New Haven had considerable community support

evidenced by the fact its leader, Douglas Miranda, appeared

to be well-known and well-received by Negroes in the community

as he rode through the streets. (It appears very possible that

the recent remarks made about the Black Panthers by Kingman

Brewster, President of Yale University, expressing his opinion

as to the inability of black revolutionaries to achieve a fair

trial anywhere in the United States may have contributed much

to deepen and widen the comminity support being given the

violent Black Panther Party .)

Source advised he observed the Black Panther Party

office in New Haven, located at 35 Sylvan Avenue, was protected

on the first floor by sandbags from floor to ceiling. The only

openings were gunports at the windows. The windows and doors

were protected by metal shields and bars. The second floor

was also protected by sandbags and appeared to be the opera-

tional area as it contained office equipment and some sleeping

• quarters.

The third floor had sleeping quarters and had food

and clothing stored there. The source was warned that the yard

surrounding the house was mined.

The source stated he saw in the Black Panther Party

office a Negro making silencers for guns. This individual was

regarded with awe by other Panthers who said he was making

silencers for various types of firearms. The source also

stated the Black Panther Party had quantities of what appeared

to be dummy or practice-type hand grenades which had "Korea"

stamped on them.

The Black Panther Party hopes to be able to

use these as bombs or grenades.

According to the source, during the weekend of

May I to May 3, 1970, the Black Panther Party in New Haven

stressed that there was to be no violence at this time as

the "pigs" were ready and outmanned and outgunned the Black

Panther Party.

The source indicated that the Black Panther Party

members in New Haven have noticed the large number of one-

man police patrol cars which they say appear very vulnerable

and opens possibilities for ambush. The source was also told

that a New Haven Police Department plain-clothes man, who is

called "Buffalve," is hated by the Black Panther Party and

that they will "get him."

The source said the philosophy of the Black Panther

Party during the weekend of May I through May 3, 1970, was

that there is a time and place for everything but this was

reliable information in the past, advised that on

May 16. 1970 he was present at the Black Panther

Party (EUP) office on Chapel Street, New Haven,

MAHES

-Onnecticut and contacted John Cheatham. . Source

stated he traveled around with Cheatham who, while

they were at the Panther location on Newhall Street,

in New Haven, showed source three brand new . 306

pump shotguns.

He told source that the Panthers were

watching the operations at the Colt., Winchester and

Olin gun manufacturing plants.

They ars seriously

thinking of a raid on Olin and they have some

sympathetic people in there who may be able to assist

them in setting it up. Cheatham bragged that he is

responsible for the New Haven Panthers ind showed

source 'a

sheet of yellow lined paper with names of New

Haven Panthers on it.

Source did not get the opportunity

to exanine it but roughly estimated it held about sixty

names.

Cheatham replaced the paper in his outside jacket

pocket where he seemed to keep it.

Cheathan also mentioned that the Mafia in the

Greater Boston area have a man, who keeps a supply of guns.

When the Mafia is going to make a.hit he issues guns and

they are returned to him. The BPP knows who he is and

where the arsenal is and are speculating about the possi

bility of hitting it. He also claimed a black soldier

attached to the Military Police or Security Department at

a New Jersey Army Installation had contacted the Panthers

about selling then some Ml6 rifles for $500. The plan is

to have this soldier drive a trück onto the base on Memorial

Day when the base is busy and load the guns and drive off

the base.

The BPP does not trust this soldier and feel

he will abscond with the $500 which he wants in advance.

They feel if he could get the guris he would be able to sell

them for $150 to $200 each.

While at the Chapel Street office of the BPP

source observed Douglas Miranda talking with three young •

White men. There were three wooden boxes of dynamite on

the floor one of which was open and contained long red

sticks of dinamite. They were being cut in smaller pieces.

The young men when speaking to one another spoke in a

language which source believed to be French. Miranda had

not paid for it and was asking how he could reach them.

He: wrote down one or two phone numbers and an address.

Miranda mentioned he had to go down souti to appear at

some demonstration for black student's. He did not

nention wherefor when.

Source felt in observing Miranda

that he seemed to be worried and jumpy and not his usual

self.

Source stated. that while in New Haven at the

conference he saw Robert Heard, Orlando/Yaughn and Winfield

"Chambars from the Boston Panthers.

MENDER OF SUBECT ORCINZATION •

The Panthers said the yeat big rally would be in

Washington, D. C. on Emancipation Day and they would be

there.

On the wall of the room which one enters on coming

into the Chapel Street office are three or four telegrams

posted up from people who have made large donations to the

Panthers. One from Alabama was for $3000.00.

Source noted that the Panthers occupy this whole

building.

He was told

that the Panther gun expert.

, the

one who was designing silencers for Panther guns, is in

charge of security for the building and has placed steel

plates on the doors leading into the building and over the

When source registered he was assigned a room in

On May 17, 1970, he attended the showing of a film,

"Battle of Algiers" which consisted of various aspects of

guerilla fighting and showed house to house combat and roof

top fighting.

On May 13, 1970, he attended a workshop "Revolutiónary

Action on Campus and in Conmunity." There were at least 100

persons present and the group seemed to be made up of four

factions, two were white and one of these consisted of

Students for a Democratic Society Weathermen and the other

called themselves some "Brigade" the exact name of which

source was unable to learn.

The other two groups were

black and were the Black Panther Party and Black Student

Union.

Douglas Miranda and two Panthers from California

spoke.

Mrs. Artie Seale spoke briefly. The workshop

was told that students should draw their savings out of

the bank and invest them in the necessary arms and material

for revolution.

An underground should he formed by

students from all states and weapons, food supplies, medical

supplies and information stockpiled.

The community should be organized and one suggestion

was that Welfare mothers' stockpile can foods distributed

by the Welfare. Defense groups should be seeking weapons

and bombs for the people's arsenal.

Intelligence files should be kept on all black

police and daily reports kept on their activities so that

at a later date they can be judged by the people and tried.

Maps should be made pinpointing all emergency

shelters, hospitals, fire stations,

reservoirs, telephone

installations and utilities, railroad terminals and airports.

The names and addresses of all public officials,

city and state, should be recorded and classified so they

can be rcadily moved on if necessary.

EXTREMIST PHOTOGRAPH ALBUM

EXTREMIST MATTERS

75293-12.

The purpose of this memorandum

recommend

that

| the Black Nationalist Photograph Album (BNPA) be renamed the

Extremist Photograph Album and that it be expanded to include

extremist individuals in Klan and similar white extremist groups

meeting criteria for inclusion.

It is also recommended the

attached airtel be sent all offices and Legal Attaches (Legats),

Paris, Ottawa, and Mexico City, advising them of changes.

The BNPA is available to all offices, Legats, Paris,

ORea, pod Me Acaditi A Trently it includes

and!

FOREIGN POLICE AGENCY

a photograph,

biographical data and, where appropriate, confirmed felony con-

victions of individuals who are militant black nationalists, leaders

but not necessarily limited to black extremist groups, black

extremists who are fugitives in Bureau criminal cases

extremist informants who travel in behalf of their respective

extremist organizations. Approximately 484 names are included

in the BNPA.

* *2

The BNPA has been a valuable investigative aid in our

'also.

CO

investigations of black extremists who travel by making available

photographs and background data.

Inclusion of extremist individual

in the Klan and similar white extremist groups who come within

the above criteria for inclusion in the BNPA would prove equally

valuable. It is estimated that approximately 25 to 30 individuals

connected with Klan and similar white extremist groups will be

added as result of the above.

If approved, appropriate Manual changes will be made

and form-FD-432 will be revised for submission of data in

connection with the BNPA.

and to add this data to the Manual of Instructions.

The BNPA was approved and established in March,

1968, and consists of a photograph and biographical data

of individuals in the racial field who travel or are likely

to travel extensively. It has repeatedly proven to be an

extremely valuable aid to any office in which a black

extremist from another area travels. Experience indicates

that these extremists travel extensively and with the BNPA

an office covering the travel has a photograph and background

of the individual immediately available.

151-14415-31

Included in the album atl lEfant black nationalists,

leaders of black extremist organizations, black extremists

who are Bureau fugitives, and our racial informants who travel

on behalf of their respective extremist organization. A

separate form is prepared on such individuals by each office

and furnished to the Bureau and all offices, where a complete

album is maintained.

To cover foreign travel, the album is

also furnished to the Legal Attaches, Ottawa and Mexico City,;

and to thel A FOREIGN POLICE AGENCY... and , A THIRD.

Bureau letter 3-11-68 instructed that a Black

Nationalist Photograph Album be maintained in each Bureau

oifice. Although the original instructions were to include

the photographs of subjects known to travel, it now appears

logical to include the photographs of the principal leaders

of any black extremist organization, as experience has shown

that they can be expected

to travel

also.

The inclusion of photographs of racial informants,

particularly those in the Black Panther Party, should be

considered as the availability of such photographs could

simplify investigations when the informants travel outside

their own divisions. Those informants who have traveled for

their respective black extrenist organizations, or who ale

COMM-FBF

Ilkelyto do so, should

be included.

These photograghs and

their descriptions should be handled just as those of any

other subject and they should not be distinguished in any

way.

The availability of these photographs has proved

to be an excellent investigative aid and greatly simplifies

the handling of leads by auxiliary offices.

Each office

should review the matter at this time to determine if other

subjects or informants should be included.

Fox your information, a set of the photographs in

The recently completed special black nationalist

that many militant black nationalists travel extensively

conferences, and other meetings,

The conference felt that the distribution Field-

would be most helpful for identification purposes should one

of these individuals show up in a particular field office

Reference is made to my memorandum of May 16, 1974

providing you with our opinion that investigation by the

FBI of the Nation of Islam (NOI) should continue. In the

interim we have had an opportunity to further consider whether!

the NOI's activities appear to violate certain statutes such

as Title 18, United States Code, Sections 231, 233 (Civil

Disorder s); 241, 245 (cunspiracy lu Deprive ani Deprivaiivi vi

Civil Rights); and 2101 and 2102 (Riots).

In my May 16 memorandum, I informed you that I considered

it inadvisable to base continued investigation of the NOI on

Executive Order 10450 until the question of the continuation

of the Attorney General's list was resolved. On June 4, 1974,

the President signed Executive Order 11785, which abolished

the list and prohibited its use by any agency of the Governs

ment.

However, Section 8(a) (5) of Executive Order 10450, as

revised by Executive Order 11785, requires that investigations

conducted pursuant to Executive Order 10450 shall relate

to:*

inter alia, knowing membership

in any organization which

unlawfully advocates of practices

the commission of acts of

force or violence to

prevent others from exercising their

rights under the Constitution or laws

reports indicate that NOI may have engaged in

which deprive citizens of constitutional rights, it would

still come within the crateria of Executive orderlog 13y

The Civil Rights Division has advised that it has

received no information on which to conclude that the NOI liftids

has violated any of the

statutes within its jurisdiction (18

U.S.C. $$ 241 and 245), and is unable to express any view as.

to whether the continued investigation of the NOI is appro

However, the General Crimes Section of this Division

has recommended continued investigation for the reasons set

forth in my May 16 memorandum and on the basis of potential

violations of 8 U.S.C. 8$ 2101 and 2102 (Riots).

"and, finally, represent a potential threat to the public

safety as described in my May I6, 1974 memorandum.

As I have previously indicated, you should consult

further with the Department to reassess the basis for con-

tinuing the investigation if information is developed that

the NOI has changed its tactics and objectives and has

assumed an attitude of non-violence.

Reference is made to your letters of June 8, 1973,

August 6, 1973, and October 4, 1973, to me in which you

requested an opinion as to whether activities of the Nation

of Islam (NOI) come under the criteria of Executive Order

10450, whether any federal statutes had been violated and inter

whether the investigation of the NOI should be continued

along surrent lines. A review has been made of pertinent

FBI reports i the activitios of the coganization, its

members and activities, and consultations have been held

with members of your staff. As a result, it is our opinionl

that, for the time being, investigation of the NOI should

continue.

With respect to your specific questions, although our

'review of FBI reports indicates that NOI may have engaged

in activities which deprive citizens of constitutional

rights, and, therefore, it would come within the criteria

Of Executive Order 10450, the Department is currently

reviewing the Attorney General's list for the purpose of

determining whether its

continued existence is warranted.

Therefore,

I do not think it advisable to base continued

investigation of the NOI On Executive Order 10450, until

this question is resolved.

Insofar as any statutory violations may be concerned,

we are seeking the views of the Civil Rights Division and

we are considering further the applicability of statutes

•administered by this Division as to whether NOI's activities

should be investigated in light of statutes over which they,

and we, have jurisdiction.

A basis for continued investigation was described by

Deputy Assistant Attorney General Kevin I. Maroney when he

testified before the Committee on Internal Security of the

House of Representatives on February 20, 1974. He pointed

out, inter alia, that without a broad range of intelligence

information, the President and the departments and agencies

of the Executive Branch could not properly and adequately

protect our nation's security and enforce the numerous

statutes pertaining thereto.

There is, in our view,

sufficient evidence to indicate that certain NOI members

have been involved in disturbances and attacks on police

throughout the country as noted in reports disseminated

to the Department of Justice, other executive agencies and to

the Secret Service in connection with its responsibility for

the protection uf le President. Under thase circumstances:

I feel the Department, and in particular the Attorney General,

must continue to be informed of those organizations that engage

in violence which represent a potential threat to the public

safety. Therefore, continued investigation of this group is

warranted.

If, during the course of your investigation, information

is developed that the NOI has changed its tactics and

objectives, and has assumed an attitude of non-violence, you

should again consult with the Department to reassess the

basis for continuing the investigation. In the interim,

I will apprise you of our decision as to whether NOI's

activities appear to violate certain statutes,

e.g., Title 18,

United States Code, Sections 231, 233 (Civil Disorders),

241, 245 (Conspiring to Deprive and Deprivation of Civil

Rights), and 2101

We have conducted a continuous

security-type investiga

tion of the NOI since 1953.

Periodically, and most recently on

July 12, 1966, we have requested the Department's opinion concern-

ing possible prosecution of the NOI under appropriate statutes

or its designation under Executive Order 10450.

The Department

has repeatedly declined to take action against

the NOI citing

lack of adequate evidence of specific acts by its leaders resulting

in force being utilized or violence occurring, as well as referring

to the quasi-religious nature of the NOI as a

further deterrent o

successful prosecution.

In view of the character and activities

of the NOI, the Department requested by memorandum July 28, 1966,

that the NOI continue to be the subject of active investigation

and that the Department be furnished the results for examination

for possible violation of Federal statutes and for possible

designation under the provisions of Executive Order

10450.

During the period April 2, 1973 - May 25, 1973,

one week in-service sessions of specialized training in black

extremist matters were conducted at the FBI Academy for selected

representatives from each FBI field office except Anchorage and

It was the consensus of those attending these sessions

• that the NOI certainly warrants our continued investigative

attention in view of its substantially increased potential for

_ Violence in the past two years.

As a

considerable period of time has transpired since

the Department's last request for investigation regarding the

NOI, and in view of the increased propensity for violence of this

group, It appears in the Bureau's best interests to seek a

decision from the Department as

exists concerning the NOI and as to the desirability of continuing

Recently a suit for refund of income taxes for

the years 1966 and 1967, was instituted in the United

States District Court for the Northern District of

Illinois, by Muhammed All. The suit seeks recovery

of $97,048.68 for the years in question based upon

a claimed deduction for contributions made to the

' Holy Temple of Islam or the Nation of Islam.

In

the earlier of the two years Muhammed Ali allegedly

made a substantial contribution to the organization

and then borrowed the money from it on the same day.

As to that transaction we, of course, are maintaining

that there was no true contribution and that the two

transactions effectively eliminate any claim of

deduction.

As an alternative defense for the first

year, and as a defense in the second year as well,

we are also contending that the recipient organi-

zation was not one to which deductibility contributions

could be made since, under the statute,

part of its

earnings inured to the benefit of certain individuals,

namely its leader Elijah Muhammed and members of his

Lamily.

Evidence available to us indicates that

organization funds were used

to purchase homes, cars,

and other things for such

CONE IDENTIAL

Reference is made to your memorandum of July 18, 1966

and to our correspondence in this matter dated March 3, 1964

wherein we discussed the operations of the NOI and particu

larly the type of evidence which would be needed to initiat: D

action against the organization for designation under Secti

8(a) (5) 0f Executive Order No. 10450.

The results of the investigations conducted in this

matter have been closely followed and it is noteworthy that

since our last communication there has been no significant

change as to the character and tactics of the organization.

The Fruit of Islam and Military Girls' Training groups con-

tinue to function

and the role of the white man as a devil

and snake continues to be the central theme of all

preachings of the minister in the various temples. It is

also to be observed that the leadership continues to deni

grate the American flag and advocate disobedience of any

law contrary to the beliefs of the Muslims.

While it is clear that the leadership preacher's dis-

trust of all other groups and thac the membership owes

allegiance only to the Muslim Cult, the tenor of the

preachings are in the nature of religious prophecies subject

to be fulfilled at some unknown future time by the supreme

rower, Allah.

an opinion be furnished at this time as to whether the

activities of the Nation of Islam come within the criteria

of Executive Order 10450 or its activities are in violation

of any other Federal statute.

OBSERVATIONS:

The Nation of Islam is an all-Negro semireligious

organization which advocates a doctrine of violent hatred

of the United States Government and the white race.

organization is headed by Elijah Muhammad with headquarters

in Chicago, Illinois. We have conducted a continuous

security-type investigation of this organization since 1953.

Periodically, we have requested the Department's opinion

as to possible prosecution of the Nation of Islam under

appropriate statutes or designation under Executive Order

10450, most recently on January 31, 1964.

The Department has repeatedly declined to take

action against the Nation of Islam, citing lack of specific

acts of force or violence by its leaders or members.

The

Department makes repeated reference to the quasi-religious

nature of the Nation of Islam as a further deterrent to

successful prosecution.

Recognizing the threat to the

internal security of the Nation posed by the Nation of Islam,

the Department has requested our investigation be continued

and the names of appropriate Nation of Islam officials be

included in our Security Index and that they be considered

for apprehension during a period of national

emergency.

mans

There is insufficient evidence to warrant proceedings

for violation of any Federal statute within the jurisdiction of

the Internal Security Division's responsibility.

Section 8(a) (5) of Executive Order No. 10450 provides

for the designation of "any foreign or domestic organization,

association, movement, group, or combination of persons which is

totalitarian, Fascist, Communist, or subversive, or which has

its activities to be in the category, of "subversive, or which

with guns.

At every meeting the white

man is characterized as a devil, a

snake who has tortured the Negro and always will; that this white

devil must be exterminated along with his black sympathizers; à

that the white man was alloted by. Allah, their Supreme power,

certain period on this earth and this period is now up; that

all

NOI members must await the signal from Elijah Muhammad to indicate

the beginning of the extermination of the white devils to make

room for a Negro takeover of the country; that such

Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X and others, preach that they must

have a part of the territory of the United States as their own

exclusive territory together with sulficient financial means

to set them up economically independent. At their meetings, the

NOI members denigrate the American flag and advocate disobedience

of any law contrary to the beliefs of the Muslims.

This reported information, however, is insufficient

to prove a policy of advocacy or approval of

the commission of

acts of force or violence to deny other persons their rights

under the Constitution of the United States.

The aciivities reported must be shown to be more than

mere prophecies or utterances made with the hope of ultimate

attainment of their desired aims.

For example, while teaching

that the white man must be exterminated they do not say by whom

or how. There should be available evidence to show that the

advocacy or approval of the commission of acts of violence to deny

others their Constitutional rights is calculated to

the foreseeable future incite the

is needed to show the specific acts taken by particular individual

leaders in advocating or approving acts of force and violence;

not that "heads will roll in the streets", which could be merely

1 prediction, but rather what specific plan of action,

has been made to bring about such event: not the abstraci

reaching that Allah will cause the desired event,

but the concrete

steps taken by specific individual. leaders to effectuate their

goals.

It is fully realized that

such evidence is not easily

obtained even if it exists;

and finally there seems to be some

indication that the leaders

are becoming more cautious in their

utterances.

Of acts of force and violence to deny individuals their constitutional

rights or in seeking to alter the form of government of the United States

In previous opinions, the Department advised a review of the

activities of the NOI did not constitute violations of any Federal

In fact,

the Department in the past has contended the

language used by NOI officials does not advocate overthrow of the

Government by unconstitutional means but seeks. to arouse hatred

against the white race as a whole.

continue to furnish data concerning NOI for future study. ' Wei have:

CONFIDENTIAL

This is in response to your memorandum of January 10,

1962, inquiring about the possibility of designation of the

captioned organization pursuant to the provisions of

Executive Order No. 10450, and asking whether its activities

are in violation of any federal statute.

An examination of the reports and memoranda pertaining

to the subject organization fails to disclose sufficient

evidence to warrant prosecutive action against the leaders

under the Smith Act and other related statutes, or to justify

the institution of designation proceedings. The reasons

set forth in our memorandum of September 21, 1960, are

relevant to the present situation.

Because of the radical, semi-secret, and violent nature

of this organization, and the continuing tendency on the part

of some of its leaders to use language of implied threats .

against the Government, we are asking the Bureau to continue

its investigation of the organization and its leaders.

CONE IDENTIAI

This is in reply to your memorandum to the Attorney General

dated September 9, 1960, inquiring about the possibility of pro-

secutive action against the leaders or designation of the captioned

organization under provisions of Executive Order No. 10450.

The available evidence concerning the activities of the

leaders and members of this organization falls far sl

short of the

evidentiary requirements sufficient to meet the standards set forth

In the Yates decision. Thile the leaders of the Nü1 at Limes re

sort to the use

of Virulent and vicious language which would incite

the members to individual acts of violence against the white race,

it is more calculated and designed to arouse hatred and antipathy.

against the white race as a race,

rather than against the Government.

There is evidence of language which speaks of the destruction of

America, but is couched more in terms of prophecy and prediction,

often referring to the "War of Armageddon," than in terms of incite-

ment to action. Moreover, the First Amendment would require

something more than language of prophecy and prediction and implied

threats against the Government to establish the existence of a

clear and present danger to the nation and its citizens.

1960

Regarding designation of the NOI pursuant to the provisions

of Executive Order 10450, it is our opinion that hate-language em-

ployed by the organization's leaders is not probativeos the criteria

of "subversivel nor is it sufficient to establish the NOI to be an

organization ". . • seeking to alter the form of government by ?,

unconstitutional means."

"Although there' is substantial evidence of

NOI's advocacy of future violent reprisals-for alleged vrongs com-

mitted against one or more of its members, the evidence is

insufficient at this time to meet the criterion that it has adopted

a policy of advocating or approving the commission of such acts

of violence to deny others

their constitutional lights.

During the past years there has been an exchange of

corsespondence between this Bureau and the Department concerning

what legal action, if any, can be taken against this organization

and/or its

menders.

The Department by various memoranda has advised

that a revion of this matter has disclosod there is insufficient

evidence to establish a violation of tho smith Act of 1940 or any

other statute of which this Bureau has investigative jurisdiction;

has disclosed the organizacion appears to have no progran of action

which reasonably would be calculated to bring about or attempt to

bring about the violent overthrow of the United States Government;

and has disclosed there is insufficient basis upon which to

proceed against this organization pursuant to the provisions of

Executive Order 10450.

The Department from tune to time has advised

that it desires that security-type investigations be conducted

concerning the leaders of the organization and/or its active

participating members for consideration for apprehension during

the period of a national energency and for inclusion in the Security

Index.

In view of the extreme radical and violent nature of this

organization and its leaders I thought this matter should be called

to your attention in order that you may consider whether there is

any legal action that can be taken or whether the organization can

be designated pursuant to the provisions of Executive Ordex 10450.

Your File No. 25-330971

CONFIDENTIAL

This is with further reference to your memorandum

dated

June 19, 1959, wherein you request to be advised

Whether any action against the Nation of Islam (NOI) is

contemplated under provisions of Executive Order No.

10450.

MAY

As you know, it has been the Department's policy

not to designate religious or quasi-religious organi

zations.

On the other hand, the NOI's basic tenets make

this a potentially dangerous

organization in any emergency

172.

For this reason, extensive study and consideration was

given the Bureau reports with a view of determining whether

the NOI falls within the purview of Executive Order No.

10450.

As you have been previously advised, the designation

of NOI poses a number of legal problems.

For example, the

inclusion of NOI under the category that it is an organi-

zation"

.... seeking to alter the form of Government of

the United States by unconstitutional means", has been

determined to be inapplicable inasmuch as the language

used by Elijah Muhammed and his ministers seeks to arouse

hatred and antipathy against the white race as a whole,

rather than seeking to alter the form of government, and

any language concerning the destruction of the government

usually has been couched in terms of prophecy or prediction

rather than in terms of incitement to action in the fore-

seeable future.

It has also been determined'that there is insufficient

basis upon which to proceed against the NOI under any other?

Amendment insofar as freedom of speech is concerned.

Any

prosecution involving members of this organization will un-

doubtedly be reviewed by the courts not only

from this as

pect, but also from the

"freedom of religion" clause of the

first Amendment. It can; therefore, be anticipated that

the courts will require that the proos against any member

of this organization be strong and unequivocal, mainly be-

cause of the claimed religious natuse of the organization.

FIRAND

With regard to possible prosecutions under sec-

tions 1001 and 1621 of Title 18, United States Code, We

have reviewed all individual cases coming within the pur

view of these statutes and, to date, have been unable to

recommend prosecution in any of them for the various

reasons of which you have been apprised in our previous

correspondence in this matter.

Because of the repeated

acts of disrespect to-

ward our flag shown by leaders of this organization, we are

considering the desirability of proposed legislation, simi-

lax to Title 4, Section 3 of the United States Code, which

is applicable only to the District of Columbia, to make

criminal acts of desecration or other disrespectful acts di-

rected toward our country's flag.

With regard to possible designation proceedings,

certain legal problems created by an action under the appli-

cable criteria are under consideration and an analysis is

being made of the more recent reports submitted by the Bureau.

You will be advised concerning this matter as soon as a de-

cision has been reached.

Memo to Mr. Belmont

Re: Nation of Islam

25-330971

on a continuing basis with copies of reports concerning all investiga-

tions.

As of 6/15/59 there were 400 NOl members on the security

Index.

the bepartment has recognized that this organizarion has

dangerous potentiality as it accepts the fact that members of NOI

should be on Security Index.

In an emergency through the Emergency

Detention Program the effectiveness and operations of this organization

would be destroyed through the apprehension of its key members.

1/11/50 we presented the facts of

this case to the Department to see if

legal action could be taken, including placing the NOI on the Attorney

General's list of subversive organizations (pursuant to E.0.10450).

Department replied by memorandum 2/7/56 that the organization does not

warrant designation under E.O. 10450 or consideration under the Smith Act

of 1940. It is noted that we could expect considerable difficulty in

producing wienesses to clearly depict the violent nature of this organi-

zation at any administrative hearing because we have gained most of our

information from live Negro informants who would be extremely loathe to

testify publicly because of the inherent physical danger from other members

of the organization and ostricism by other members of

their race.

ACTION:

Despite the above, there is attached for your approval a letter

which raises again with the Department the question of possible legal

action against the NOI.

As you know, this Division has had under review FBI reports

on the Muslim Cult of

September 7, 1955, Subject: Program for Apprehension and Detention of

Persons Considered Potentially Dangerous to the National Defense and

Public Safety of the United States.

• The review was being conducted with a view toward making a

determination as to whether or not the Muslim Cult of Islam should be

designated by the Attorney General, and also the effect the reported

membership in this organization would have on the consideration of whe-

ther an individual should be listed on the Security Index.

The memorandum to me of March 25, 1957, captioned "Emergency

Detention Program!' enclosed a copy of an FBI report dated March 12,

1957, at Atlanta captioned "James Alfred Martin, JX., was" and bore the

character "Security Matter--NOI.

The first paragraph of the details

of this report reflects the following:

"On January 21 and January 22,

1957, Confidential Informant Atlanta I-1, who has furnished reliable

information in the past, advised that the organization formerly referred

to as the 'Muslim Cult of Islam' has been described by ELIJAH MUHAMMAD,

the national leader, as the 'Nation of Islam' and/or Muhammad's Temples

of Islam' The character of this case is therefore being changed from

'SECURITY MATTER - MCI' to 'SECURITY MATTER - NOI'

It is not clear if your Bureau intends to substitute the

"Nation of Islam" for the

"Muslim Cult of Islam on the sole basis of

the description furnished to Atlanta Informant I'l, nor is it clear whe-

Ilther the "Muslim Cult of Islan" is no longer in existence.

If it is intended that the Nation of Islam be a substitute for

Reference is made to your memorandum dated January 11, 195

which transmitted a summary report of the activities of the subject

organization, wherein you requested to be advised whether these

activities constitute a violation of any statute within the juris-

diction of the Bureau.

The Muslim Cult of Islam is ostensibly a religious organ

ization composed exclusively of Negroes.

The principles of

Islam are (1) belief in Allah; (2) belief in the prophets;

(3) belief in the scriptures that the prophets bring; (4) prayer;

(5) charity.

The express purpose of the Cult is to clean up the

dark people physically and spiritually so they will be respected

by the other civilized people of the earth.

It desires to elimin

prostitution, gambling and drinking among the dark people so that

they can be respected. It teaches that its members should not

take any par' in fighting or anything pertaining to fighting.

Despite this toaching, the leaders have repeatedly advised that

any member who kills your white men will be assured of salvation..

according to trijati

Mohammed; the national leader of the Cult,

Allah, taught that d1l dark people are Asiatics and belong to the

Nation of Islam and that the "wicked" (white devils) were to be

destroyed by fire and that the dark people would then have peace

when this source of their trouble was eliminated.

A fundamental tenet of the organization is hatred of the

white man.

Faithful members are promised that under the leadership

of Allah they will be delivered from, the domination of the white

among the reasons given by the leaders why Cult members should not

register for Selective Service or seive in the armed forces.

Each Temple of the organization has a branch known as

the Fruit of Islam, composed of the able bodied male members. T'he

members of these groups are instructed in close order drill, sel

defense,

eating habits, wearing apparel and the study of regula

tions and doctrines oi the Cult. In some of the lemples, addi

are also given,

The report cites four specific acts of violence in

which Cult members have been involved. These acts may be sum

marized as follows:

Silver Spring, Maryland, Incident. A group of approximately

30 Cult memoers was traveling in a day coach en route from Jersay City,

to Chicago.

Shortly before arrival in Wasnington, Do Los some members

of the party became involved in a dispute with a railroad porter over

the issuance of a soiled pillow to one of the groud. Several members

of the group assaulted the porter, who then broke contact with the

group and reported the incident to the Station vaster at Washington

The train had departed Washington before any action could be taken;

but police in Silver Spring, Maryland, were requested to investigate

the incident. Upon boarding the train in Silver spring, four police

officers were assaulted by Cult members and the guns and blackjacks.

Oi two were taken by Cult members. After police reinforcements

arrived, nine Cult members were arrested and charged with assault and

battery, inciting a riot, and interfering with an officer in the per

formance of his duties.

Six defendants were tried, convicted, and

sentenced to terms ranging from six months to twenty-one months.

The officers shot and wounded two of their attackers,

who were identified as Cult members. Three MCI members were tried

and convicted of attempting to incite a riot.

san Diego.

California Incident. A dinner was held at

Fort Rosecrans for the 1402d Combat Ingineers Battalion, a Negrc

National Guard organization which lad been called into Federal Service.

A civilian who attended the dinner, identified as Harrison Cole, a

Cult member, engaged several of the recruits in conversation. When

it was determined that he was making seditious statements to the

recruits, he was removed from the fost by armed escort.

The report also contains numerous statements by Elijah

Mohammed and the various ninisters of the organization. These state-

ments appear to advocate the violent overthrow of the Government and

I the slaughter of the White race.

The dominant theme of the utterances

is that all persons who are not members of the cult willbe destroyed

in the War of Armageddon, at which time the Government will be

overthrown and the Muslims will come to power. There are also

statements which approve the acts of violence committed by the

Mau-Mau in Africa and the Fuerto Rican Nationalists, and which exhort

Cult members to kill the white devils in order to bring about the

day of their deliverance. It should also be noted that the report

contains other statements by leaders of the organization to the

eifect that the deliverance of the luslims is to be brought about

through a divine act of Allan, who will destroy the "wicked" and

overthrow their government without any assistance from Cult members.

According to this teaching, the role of the membership of the Cult

in the War of Armageddon will be entirely a passive one.

Although the report is replete with violent

statements by

the leadership of the organization and there have been acts of

violence by the individual members, It is believed that the evzdence

of the organization which could reasonably be calculated to attempt

the violent overthrow of the Government..

The statements of the

Leaders of the organization, while they do express the desira-

bality of overthrowin, the Government, are more in the realm

engaged, fail to evidence any plan of the organization or its

All these acts are of the spontaneous type, and except

for the fact that the persons involved are members of the organ-

ization, have no connection at all. It is also believed that the

The attached memorandum from Assistant Attorney

contained in Depariment memorandum of 8/23/55 that the names

and I'BI file numbers of members of the Muslim Cult of Islam (MCI)

included in the security Index be forwarded to the Department

for review for the purpose of determining whether their names

should be retained in the security Index.

The Director askea

"What about this? Haven't we complied with request of

August 23? H."

The Depariment's request of 8/23/55 was discussea in

my memorandum of : 912/55. I recommended that

this list not be

furnished the Department pending a decision by the Department

as to whether membership in, active participation in the affairs

thereof, and adherence to the basic tenets of the McI constitute

sufficient basis to include an individual's name in the security

Index. We have been pressing the Department for a decision in

this matter since 8/8/55 and, with the Director's approval, I

personally delivered a memorandum to Mr. Tompkins on 9/8/55

requesting the Department to thoroughly review the organizational

reports on the MCI. I informed Mr. Tompkins at that time that,

if the Department arrived at the conclusion that the cult did

not constitute a potentially dangerous instrumentality in the

event of a national emergency and that active participation in

the affairs thereof and adherence to its basic teners were

insufficient to consider an individual potentially dangerous,

this Bureau would immediately review the cases of the security

Index subjects for appropriate action and that; in the meantime,

the individuäl list of security Index subjects was not being

referred to the Department for review. lui

While I still feel that the basic problem involved. has

not been resolved, it is noted that the Department indicates: that

the reappraisal is being made. of the case on the basis of a

the Mot was reportedly organized in 930 In betroit,

Michigan.

The national leader since 1933 is Elijah /Mohammed

who claims to have been

sent by Allah, the supreme Being,

to lead the Negroes out of slavery in

the United States.

Members of the Cult fanatically follow the alleged teachings

of Allah as interpreted by Elijah Mohammed and disavow allegiance

to the United States.

Members pledge allegiance only to

Allah and Islam and believe that any civil law which conilicts

with MusLim Law should be disobeyed. The cult teaches

that members of the colored race cannot be considered citizens

of the United States since they are in slavery in this country

and must free themselves by destroying non-Muslims and

Christianity in the coming x"War of Armageadon." For this

purpose the Cult has a military branch called the *Fruit of

Islam" composed of all able-bodied members who participate -

in military drill and judo training.

The Department has advised the Bureau by letters

dated 2/9/53 and 1/26/55 that evidence presently available

in this case is insufficient to establish a violation of the

smith Act, a conspiracy to violate the Smith Act or Iltle 18,

¿ Code' Code (Seditious (Seditious Conspiracy)..

In view of the fanatical beliefs of the MCI and

the tense racial situation that exists today, It is believed

we should send the Department this summary report and the

exhibits thereto with the request that this material be

reviewed to determine if the activities of the MCI are in

Iviolation of any Federal statutes within the Bureau's jurisdiction.

The original of the attached memorandum

dated

september 7,

1955, to Assistant Attorney General Tompkins,

was delivered personally by me on september & to dr.

Tompkins. I aduised him that in our correspondence with

the Department on the Muslim Cult of Islam, we had the

distinet impression that the Depariment has not thoroughly

reviewed the file and all investigative reports on this

organization, I pointed out that there are approzimately

150 persons on the security Inder who are connected with

this cult and that the question involved is whether the

Department has sufficiently reviewed the file to arrive

at a conclusion as to unether membership in a leadership

capacity, or active copacity in the "fruit of IsIUm"

(the military section of the cult), should be considered

dangerous in the event of an emergency.

I told AT. Tompkins

that is the Department comes to the conclusion such persons

wiII not be dangerous in an emergencys this Bureau would

immediately review the cases of the security Inder subjects

Sor appropriate action and that in the meantime the individual

List of security Index subjects is not being referred to the

Department for review.

I advised ur. Tomplins that the memorandum of.

Gandy -

As result of action taken by the department to remove three

members of the Muslim cult of Islam (MCI),

, all Government employees,

from the security Index, we directed a letter to the Department August 8,

1955, requesting advice as to (I) whether we should continue to conduct

security-tupe investigations of the leaders and active participating

members of the lCI and particularly the members of the Fruit of Islam (FOI),

the military arm of the cult, to determine whether the names of such

individuals should be added

to the security Index and (2) whether the

names of all members of the McI currently on the security Index should

be removed from the security Index.

Hith respect to the questions posed to the Department, the

Department advised (1) that the Bureau should continue to conduct

security-type investigations of the leaders and active participating

members of the McI and (2) that an individual review and evaluation

of derogatory information reported on each of the leaders and active

participating menbers of the cult must be conducted to ascertain whether

as individuals, they should be removed from the security Inder or should

continue to be included, based on substantiutdevidence of each respective

individual's anarchist and revolutionary activities and beliejs, as

members of the cult. the Department further noted that on the basis of

available information the anarchist and revolutionary statements

reportedly made by a single minister of the cult are not of such scope as

ministers.

The Department concludes that statements and activities on the

part of individual members of the cult indicating anarchist and revolu

tionary beliefs, will be determining factors in determining whether or not

such individual members come within the revised security Index criteria.

The Department requests that a complete list of the names and FBI file

numbers of the members of the MCI currently included in the security

Index be made available and that the Internal security Division be kept

informed of the individual members' activities on a continuing basis

in

order that their cases may be reviewed of re-reviewed in light of any new

evidence or information developed.

Thumbnail Sketch of the MCI:

Reliable informants report that this cult is an organization

composed entirely of Negroes which was reportedly organized around

1930 in Detroit, lichigan. The national leader and founder is

Elijah Mohammed who claims to have been sent by Allah to lead the Negroes

out of slavery in the United States. Members fanatically follow the

alleged teachings of Allah as interpreted by lohammed and disavow

allegiance to the United States.

Members pledged allegiance only to

Allah and Islam and believe any civil law which conflicts with Muslim

law should be disobeyed. The cult teaches that members of the dark

skinned race cannot be considered citizens of. the

United States since

they are in slavery in this country and, therefore "war of Armageddon. "

must free themselves

by destroying non-muslims and Christianity in the

this purpose the cult has a military branch called the fruit of Islam

composed of all male able-bodied members uno participate in military

drill and judo training.

Hembers of the cult also believe that they

are directly related to all Asiatic nations and any conflict involving

any. Asiatic nation and the Western nations is considered a part of the

War of Armageddon in which the Asiatic nation will be victorious.

Instances of Violence Against Police Authority: •

on several occasions the primitive hatred with which members

are so imbued, exploded into open violence. In June 1950 the Detroit

Police, in attempting to solve a traffic problem, were assaulted by a

number of Negroes in front of the Temple of Islam. The officers had

their night sticks taken away, were forced to use firearms, and were

given a severe beating by the assembled Negroes.

These Negroes were

identified as members of the Muslim cult of Islam.

Another incident occurred in September 1950 in San Diego,

involving two officers of the san Diego police Department who were

attempting to serve a traffic warrant. upon arrivingat the address,

two individuals accosted the officers and aduised them the subject of the

warrant was not at home.

When the officers

exhibited the warrant and

expressed their intention of searching the house, they were ruthlessly

attacked. This perpetrated a near riot and necessitated the calling

out of additional-cars and approximately twenty officers. Before the

subject was taken into custody and order was restored, an unknown

individual fired three shots into a police. car.

It was later determined

that the subject and the two individuals wno intercepted the officers

were all members of the san Diego Temple of the Muslim Cult of Islam.

Memorandum for MT. Boardman:

In february, 1951, another incident occurred which involved

a disturbance between members of the cult who were en route to the

yearly convention in Chicago. Members of the Montgomery county Police

in silver spring, Maryland, were alerted. Four policemen uno met the

train and entered the car were assaulted

and had their guns and

blackjacks taken away from them by members of the cult.

necessiated a call for police reinforcements, and nine members of the

Cult were removed to the station and charged with assault.

Opposition to Federal Authority:

such open defiance is not relegated merely to local authority.

In view of the stand this organization has taken in connection with

service in the armed forces,

since the

passage of the selective Iraining and Service Act of 1940, adhered to the

teachings of their leaders in refusing to register, because they claim

•to be registered in the book of Allah in the Holy City of Mecca and

cannot serve two masters.

In 1942, three leaders of the HI, including

Elijah Mohammed, and seventy members of the Chicago Temple were arrested

by Agents of the Bureau. The charges leveled against the leaders included

failure to register for selective service, sedition and counseling their

followers "that members of the temple of Islam should not go into the

Arny and should ignore any cards or letters from the local draft board."

The indictments returned for sedition and conspiracy to commit sedition

were dismissed in lay, 1943; however, the three leaders served prison

¿erms for selective service violations. of the seventy members arrested,

approxinately forty served prison terms for violation of the selective

Training and Service Act of 1940.

During the course of the second Morld War and the war in Korea,

such incidents were repeated throughout the country, and a number of

convictions were secured for violations of the selective service acts;

now with the threut of hostilities in the far east, the cult ras

again taken an open stand against service in the armed forces of the

United States.

They continue to include in their teachings such

' information as:

The black people have always been helping

the devil by fighting in his wars, but the

Muslims do not go to war but rather to jail.

Those who register will be kicked out of

the nation of Islam and will die with the

white devils.

Memorandum for Mr. Boardman:

Disloyalty and Disrespect for the United States Government:

Intertwined with dejiance of the provisions of the Selective

service acts is the vivid disloyalty to the Government and the continual

disrespect for its laws. such comments as "no good Muslim registers

for the draft, vote or do anything else in the devil's government, " are

repeatedly made throughout the various temples. In 1942, Elijah Mohammed,

the leader of this cult, described the American flag as follows:.

flag you see, here is the flag of the white devil. The white that you

see, and notice that you don't see any black.ony where on it, represents

the white race; the red represents the blood that they lose keeping it for

the white deurd alone, the blue background,

the white stars represent

justice to the whites, not the red men or

the black men but only jor

the white devils."

When the unrted states was at war with Japan, the culi considered

the Japanese their "little brown brothers" and gleefully predicted

the victory of the land of the rising sun. at the outbreak of the war

in korea, the cult immediately allied its sympathies and spoke in

glowing terms of the strength of their korean brothers.

They have

of the leaders nave lost no occasion to rise, to the dejense of the

States and Russia.

Observations:

Based upon an analysis of the rabid teachings of this group, it

is definitely considered that these people present a threat to the

internal security of the united states, and would, with the right number

of followers and the opportunity, be more than willing to perform any

acts which would subvert American principles and endanger the existence

of the American nation as such.

such a potential threat could materialize

by actual violence ageinst civil authorities prior to a national

emergency as has been done by the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico or

by seizing upon the opportunity presented by a national emergency to

commit acts of violence based upon their hatred and disloyalty to the

Government of the United States.

Our instructions to the field are that

security-type investigations are to be conducted on individual members

of the cult who are reported to be (1) functionaries or leaders of the

Cult; (2) members of the military section of the cult known as the

"Fruit of Islam" or (3) active participants in carrying out fanatical

and disloyal aims and purposes of the cult. Individuals affiliated with

the cult have been retained in

the security Index after careful evaluation

of their activities in furthering the violence and anarchist aims and

purposes of the cult under thut portion of the revised security Index

Mmorandu for Mr. Boardman:

criteria which reads "investigation has developed information that the

individual though not a member or a participant in the activities of

a subversive organization has anarchist or revolutionary beliefs and is

likely to seize upon the opportunity presented by a national

emergency to. endanger the public safety as shown by overt acts or

statements within the last three years established through reliable

sources,

informants or individuals." As of the current date, we have

151 such individuals included in the Security Index.

Extensive

investigation has been conducted of the activities of the organization

since 1942 and the numerous reports in the matter have been foruarded

to the Department.

It appears from the conments contained in the

Department memorandum of August 23, 1955,

that an analysis of the

potential dangerousness of this organization and its menbers has not

been the subject of a thorough study by the Department. The Domestic

Intelligence

Division feels that we should cite the information set

out previously herein and specifically draw the attention of the

Department to the organizational reports submitted concerning the

Huslim cult of Islam, and request the Department to reconsider its

stand in this matter. If the department has

reason jor not desiring the names of these individuals included in

the security Index, it is felt that we should be so informed.

RECOMENDATIONS:

(1) IJ you approve,

there is attached a proposed letter to

the Department along the lines mentioned above.

(2)

It is recommended that we not furnish the depariment a

list of the 151 individuals, ucI members, included in the security

Index pending reconsideration by the Department.

(3) The Department's correspondence indicates it has not thoroughly

reviewed the entire file on the duslim cult but itemont we deliven on

on the statement of one minister.

Ij you agrees

for the department to thoroughly reuieu the sule on this organization li

prior to any decision as to the individual members.

Memorandum for Mr. Boardman

Memorandum

from Assistant Attorney General Tompkins

dated August 10, 1954,

captioned "Elijah Mohammed, et al,

MusLim Cult of Islam, Internal Security - MCI," stated in

part

that the MCI continues to foster a program of

' vicious racial

hatred, fanned continually by the fanatical preaching of

Mohammed and his ministers, bitterly denouncing the United

states Government, Its flag and leaders, and proclaiming the

eventual destruction of the country and

the white people thereof.

He further stated that the fanaticism of the MCI members appears

to be of such an extreme degree as to render possible an out-

break of violence by Cult members which might be similar in

nature to the attempted assassination of the members of the

House of Representatives by the Puerto Rican Nationalists.

OBSERVATIONS:

The conclusion reached by Mr. Tompkins in regard to

the three Federal Government employees in regard to the dangerousness

of the individuals or the anarchist and violent aims and purposes

of the MCI appears contrary to the observations in his memorandum

of August 10, 1954.

Individuals deemed dangerous because of anarchist

or revolutionary acts or statements have been placed in the

Security Index both under the old Security Index criteria and

the revised criteria, even though there is no affiliation with

the CP or other Marxist revolutionary groups. The criteria

clearly spelled out this situation.

The radical group of Negroes who are members of the

MCI are lead by Elijah Mohammed.

with Muslim Law should be disobeyed.

The members disavow

allegiance to the United States and pledge allegiance only to

Islame

They do not consider it their duty to register for

Selective Service.

The members consider themselves merely slaves

of this country who will continue to be slaves until they free

themselves. This Cult presents a threat to the internal security

similar to that presented by the Nationalist Party of

Puerto Rico. Their training, teachings and statements

clearly depict them as potential security threats.

Only

The three Federal employees fall within

If you approve, there is attached a memorandum

as to whether the investigations

Miss Gan's

CONFIDEN TAN

This refers to my memorandun of September &, 1953 wherein

you were advised thai pursuant to your request a review of the

material submitted on the above subject would be made for the

purpose of determining whether prosecution will be authorized and

whether further investigation is desired with regard to the Selective

Service conspiracy phase of this case.

The investigative reports reflect that the Moslem Cult of

:.

Islam is described by informants as a viciou und famatical organi

zation composed of Negroes whose members disavor allegiance to the

United States and declare allegiance only to Islam and Allah's

Prophet, Hijah Mohammed.

The organization's rules imply civil dis

obedience to the laws of the United States while awaiting the annihi

lation of the White Race in the Biblical reference to the "War of

Armageddon. "

In connection with Its policy of civil disobedience to

the laws of the United States, several instances bave baen reported

where leaders of this Cult have, during the course of meetings, made

statements to the effect that its members should not comply with the

Selective Service Laws and to disregard orders received fron their

respective local boards.

This attitude is apparently in line with its general

policy of opposition to civil authority and there is no spacific

intornation developed which would establish that a conspiracy was

formed for the purpose of evading or counseling evasion of service

in the Armed Forces of the United States.

OPIES DESTROYIO

While there have been instances where individuals have

$5 NOV

23

counseled such evasion, it could not be established that they were

acting as part of a conspiracy and, consequently, prosecution based

on this phase of the case is not warranted. In the circumstances,

therefore, no specific investigation as to this possible violation

on the part of the organization is desired aù this time.

However, 1t

Is réquested that individual instances of counseling evasion or refusal

6 1.

to comply with Selective Service laws be reported to the Criminal

Division.

Reference is made to your memorandum of December

30, 1952,

wherein you requested to be advised if the activities of the

captioned organization and its leaders constitute a violation of

the Smith Act of 1940. Your memorandum also requests advice as to

whether security-type investigations should be conducted regarding

the leaders and/or members of the Cult for consideration in connection

with the Security Index.

The file in this case has been reviewed and it is my opinions.

that the evidence presently available is insufficient to establish a

violation of

the Smith Act or a conspiracy to violate said Act. This

conclusion has been reached in spite of the fact that the leaders of

the Cult, in some measure at least, advocate the desirability of the

violent overthrow of the existing Government.

However, such advocacy

is expressed more in the nature of a prophecy that such overthrow will

inevitably come about under the leadership of "Allah" in the "war of

Armageddon." The organization appears to have no program of action

which reasonably would be calculated to bring about or attempt to

bring about the violent overthrow of the Government. In addition,

it is pointed out that the conclusion hereinabove expressed is to

a large extent influenced by my opinion that the evidence available

at this time is insufficient to establish such a "clear and present

danger" as is required to make application of the Smith Act consti-

I am, of course, keenly aware that an organization which

subscribes to and breeds on the fanatical beliefs of the Muslim Cult,

and which encourages bitter race prejudice and disloyalty to the

United States would, under certain circumstances, represent a serious

threat to our internal security.

This is in response to your memorandum of December 285-19515

with its attachment, in which you requested my views as to whether

the facts developed in the above matter warrant prosecution and also.

to be informed specifically of the extent of any further investigation

that is desirable.

The facts developed in the investigation to date are insuf-

ficient at this time to prove that men within the draft age have been

actually counseled, aided and abetted by members of the organization

to evade registration and/or service in the Armed Forces. However,

since the investigative report of November 28, 1951, reveals that

men within the critical age group may have been told by members of

the organization not to comply with the provisions of the Selective

Service Act and to disregard orders received from their respective

local draft boards, I believe that the investigation should be con-

tinued. In connection therewith I suggest, oon investigation o1*

subsequent Selective Service

violations by members of this cult,

*that

the delinquent be interviewed, as in the past, with a view to ascer.

taining whether his delinquency was the resinit

"being" counseled by

a member or members of the organization. If this fact is established,

it is requested that you endeavor to secure the names of those present

at that time, the date of the conversation and its substance in detail.

The information available does not reflect a violation of the

Sedition Statute, 18 U.S.C. 2387, since it does not appear that the

subject group or the members thereof have advised, counseled, urged,

or in any manner caused or attempted to cause insubordination, dis

loyalty, mutiny or refusal of duty by any member of the military or

naval forces of the United States®

During your investigations of black excremist organi-:

zations and individuals, you have furnished information indi

cating that certain individuals are extremely active and nost

vocal in their anti-Government statements and their calls for

terrorism and violence.

Although the violence potential in all

black extremists necessitates continued priority attention by

all offices, there are certain individual leaders and activists

who can be

considered as Key Black Extremists (KBE) • =

At this time, the Bureau is designating those on the

attached list as RSIs.

The term KBE does not require that an

individual actually hold an official position in an organization

to the Bureau must be made promptly.

The desirable coverage must include, but not be

limited to, the following investigation. These investigations

must be conducted with initiative and imagination in order that

the desired results are achieved. Each of these cases will

receive close scrutiny at the Bureau.

(1) A11 KBEs must be included in Priority I of

the Security Index. If not already so included, promptly

subnit FD- 122.

(2)

All KBis must be included in the Black

Nationalist Photograph Album (BNPA). Promptly submit

photograph and required background on each KBE not

presently in the BNPA and when a subject is designated

a KBE.

(3) All aspects of the finances of a KBE must

be determined. Bank accounts must be monitored.

Safe

deposit boxes, investments, and hidden assets must be

located and

available information regarding them must be

reported.

(4) Continued consideration must be given by

each office to develop means to neutralize the effectiveness

of each KBE. Any counterintelligence proposal must be approved

by the Bureau prior to implementation.

(5) Obtain suitable handwriting specimens of each

KBE to be placed in the National Security File in the

Laboratory. When possible, obtain specimens from public

records, law enforcement agencies, and similar sources.

Send specimens to the Bureau under separate cover letter

by registered mail for the attention of the FBI Laboratory.

When they are of value as evidence, so state in the transmittal

letter and request their return after copies have been made.

Specimens should be sufficient to permit future comparisons by

the Laboratory.

which may subsequently become subject to criminal proceedings.

Promptly record all such information in interview report form.

(7) Where there appears to be a possible violation

of a statute within the investigative jurisdiction of the

Bureau, the substantive violation character should be included

our coverage on certain black extremists.

Because of the violence potential of all black extremists,

we have required that the

Field give priority attention-to the

investigations of all black extremists. The information submitted

by the field indicates that there is a need for intensified coverage

on a group of black extremists who are either key leaders or

activists and are particularly extreme, agitative, anti-Government,

and vocal in

their calls for terrorism

and violence.

Leaders of

the violence-prone Black Panther Party have indicated that the

"revolution" is entering the beginning phases of actual armed

struggle and our investigations indicate there are certain extremists

moxe likely to resort to or to order terrorism as a tactic and

therefore require particular attention.

Intensified coverage to bring to bear the tatal capabi

and possible violation of federal and local law of these individuals

should receive the closest investigative and supervisory attention:

Following the receipt of an investigative summary report

reports on these individuals should be submitted every 90 days,

Re: Key Black Extremist Program

Inasmuch as KBE individuals are of the type who would be

subject to maximum investigative attention and close supervision,

the

administration and supervision of this program entails only a

minimum amount of time above that which would normally be

expended on these cases.

The continuing revolutionary activities of the individuals

designated as KBEs warrant the close investigative and supervisory

attention required by the KBE program. This program will be

reevaluated in December, 1972.

That the KBE program be

The Key Black Extremist (KBE) program is being revised into

a Key Extremist (KE) program, which will encompass the activities of

all extremist matters subjects, black, white-hate Klan-type, and

American Indian, who warrant intensive investigative attention.

Qualifications for designation as a KE and investigative requirements

The KBE program was initiated 12/23/70 to intensify

investigative coverage of selected black extremists throughout the

United States who were extremely active and posed the greatest

potential for revolutionary activity. The program's objective was

to develop complete and

It is recommended this KBE concept be revised into a KE

program, which would encompass the activities of all extremist

matters subjects, black, white-hate Klan-type, and American Indian.

The program will focus on individuals whose activities warrant

intensive investigative attention.

Individuals designated KEs will be considered for

the ADEX; a biographical sketch with photograph will be included in

the Extremist Photograph Album; all aspects of their finances will

be determined; handwriting specimens will be placed in the National

not always being afforded individuals who

1970 as the Key Black Extremist Program to provide guidelines for

intensive investigation of certain black extremist leaders and

activists whose endorsement and/or involvement in revolutionary and

terrorist activity warranted priority attention.

In January, 1973,

the program was redesignated KEP and revised to include key white-hate

Klan-type extremists and American Indian extremists in addition to

black extremists. There are approximately 90 individuals throughout

the country currently designated as Key Extremists in some 27 field

offices.

Specific instructions as to the nature and extent of

investigation to be conducted on Key Extremists are outlined in

Manual of Instructions, Section 122 A, Item 5, Pages 5 and 6, and

should be specifically reminded of the requirements set forth therein.

Re:.

157-8415

In order to make a thorough overall analysis and

reevaluation of the KEP at FBIHQ and to assist each office in .

analyzing the effectiveness of its own program, the following survey

is to be conducted:

Each office is to examine pending cases on individual

extremists (black, white-hate Klan-type, and American Indian) within

its territory to insure all who warrant designation as a Key Ixtremist

are so designated and those individuals currently designated as Key

Extremists varrant retention as same. By airtel to reach the Bureau

by 7/2/73 under the caption "Key Ixtremist Program, -

Division,

Extremist Matters," advise the Bureau that this survey has been

completed and identify appropriate individual extremists by name,

character, Bureau and field file numbers under the following self-

explanatory captions:

A. "'Individuals Currently Designated Key Extremists"

B. "Individuals Designated Key Ixtremists Who Ho Longer

Warrant Retention as a Key Extremist"

:

C. "Individuals Who Warrant Designation as a Key Extremist"

If the answer under any one of the three captions is "None," so

state.

II. Those offices with individual extremists listed under

above captions' B and C, submit by the same date in airtel form

under the individual's case castion your recommendation for inclusion

or deletion of that individual from the KEP. Full justification

should be set out and Bureau will act on your reconnendation.

III. Those offices with current individual Key Extremists

(caption A above) submit by the same date in airtel form under

by number, relative to that individual:

9. Has a full. and thorough background investigation

been completed on the subject?

If the answers to questions number 5 through 9 above are

in the negative, outline in another paragraph immediately under the

answer the specific steps underway or being instituted by your

office to fulfill this investigative requirement.

Some confusion regarding Key Extremists has arisen over

the new ADIX criteria outlined in Memorandum to All SACs 21-72 dated

9/12/72. This revised criteria make it possible to have an extremist

who warrants designation as a

. Key Extrenist and yet does not meet the

new criteria for inclusion on the ADEX. Such individuals may continue

to be designated as Key Extremists.

Additional confusion has also arisen over reporting require-

ments which were relaxed by above-mentioned Memorandum to All SACs.

Hereafter, individuals designated as Key Extremists are to be consirered

as exceptions to the above memorandum under Item 4d, Page 8, and reports

on Key Extremists are to be regularly submitted every 90 days. If no

report has been submitted on a Key Extremist within the past 90 days,

promptly prepare and submit an up-to-date report and submit follow-up

reports thereafter on a 90-day basis.

Section 122 of the Manual of Instructions is being revised

to outline more clearly the criteria for designating black, white-hate

Klan-type, and American Indian extremists as Key Extremists as well as

the ADEX status of and reporting procedures for Key Extremists.

All offices insure in the future that hew cases on individual

extremists are carefully scrutinized to see if they varrant designation

as a Key Extremist, and that an appropriate recommendation is promotly

submitted to the Bureau.

offices be sent to remind the field of the requirements of the

Key Extremist Program (KEP), to request data to aid in analysis

and reevaluation of KEP, and to assist offices in analyzing the

effectiveness of their own program.

A preliminary analysis of KEP by IS - 1 Section,

including discussions with field supervisory and investigative

personnel

attending a series of Extremist Matters In-Service

classes, has determined that continuing investigative attention is

not always being afforded individual extremists who have been

designated as Key Extremists.

KEP was instituted in 1970 as the Key Black Extremist

Program to provide guidelines for intensive investigation of certain i

black extremist leaders and activists whose endorsement and/or

E involvement in revolutionary and terrorist activities warrant

priority attention. In January, 1973, -the program was redesignated

KEP and revised to include key white-hate/ Klan-type extremists and

American Indian extremists in addition to black

Re: Key Extremist Program

Extremists under investigation, the identity of Key Extremists who

no longer warrant designation as such, the identity of individual

extremists who should be designated Key Extremists, and to deter-

mine if required investigative steps are being followed with respect

to those individuals designated as Key Extremists.

Originally, all Key Extremists were to be included in the

ADEX. Recent changes in ADEX criteria require an individual included

therein to be dangerous now to national security and some confusion

has resulted in the field over whether or not Key Extremists must be

removed as Key Extremists if they do not qualify for ADEX, The field

is being instructed that this is not necessary and an individual can

be a Key Extremist and still not qualify for ADEX. Confusion also

exists as to when reports are to be submitted on. Key Extremists due

to recent relaxation of reporting rules. Original instructions

required reports on Key Extremists every 90 days and this is being

reiterated.

We currently have throughout the United States a total of

90 individual extremists designated as Key Extremists in 27 separate

field offices.

The New York Office has 19 and the San Francisco

Office has 16. The number of Key Extremists in the remaining 25

offices range from one to eight. The results of analysis by each

field office will be thoroughly analyzed and evaluated by the IS - 1

Section with additional instructions issued, if warranted.

ACTION:

If you approve, the attached airtel to all offices in line

with the above will be sent.

Purpose of this memorandum is to justify continuation

of the Key Extremist Program.

This program was initiated 12/23/70. to intensify

investigative coverage of selective black extremists throughout

the United States who vere extremely active and posed the

greatest potential for revolutionary activities.

The program's

objective was to develop complete and detailed

information on

their day-to-day activities and luture plans.

On 1:4/73, this

program was expanded to include non-black extremist subjects.

Individuals designated

I Key Extremists (KE) are con-

sidered for the ADEX; a biographical sketch with photo is

included in the Extremist Photo Album; all aspects of financés

are placed in the National

Security File in the Laboratory Division: fingerprints are

included in the Identification Division's Single Fingerprint

File; all possible criminal violations are vigorously pursued;

emphasis is placed on obtaining records of revolutionary state-

ments. In addition, particular attention is paid to their

travel and high level informant coverage is required on each

individual.

FEC-106

Ninety individuals were initially designated under

this program but with additions and deletions, and as a result

of an annual review, this number is now 68.

API :.

Inasmuch as KE individuals are of the type who would

be subject to maximum investigative attention and close:..

supervision, the administration and sunervision of this program

entails only a minimum amount of time above that which would be

normally expended on these cases.

In view of increasing problems with which we are

faced in the overall racial field, particularly in the

development of racial intelligence concerning militant

black nationalist elements, we have carefully analyzed our fei.

informant program to place proper emphasis where needed.

Although we are making progress in developing racial sources

in the ghettos, we

feel we can do much more and must do so

rapidly in the

coming six months to be prepared for another

potential summer of violence. Proposed SAC letter attached.

To accomplish our objective of thorough penetration

of the ghettos with a network of quality sources under a

crash program, the following procedures will be instituted to

carry out this program.

tacting under this crash informant program will be living in

the ghettos; therefore, in the absence of any derogatoxy in

formation developed, background investigation should consist

of a check of field office indices, Bureau indices, FBI

Identification Division records, and local credit and arrest

records. Of course, prior to instituting any background

investigation to qualify a ghetto informant, he must be in a

position to furnish racial information and

must be willing

to cooperate with the Bureau. This individual will be carried

as a probationary racial informant and the Agent contacting

him will be constantly alert for any indications of character

traits or activities which might cause embarrassment to the

Bureau.

In addition, the information furnished by

such an

informant will not be taken on'face value but will be verified

through other sources and investigation where possible.

In addition, we are specifically instructing that

security informants active in the racial field be designated

as racial informants and that their activities be supervised

by the Racial Informant Desk.

We are also reiterating our

instructions that it is imperative and essential that the

Bureau learn of any advance planning or organized conspiracy

(G) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- In view of the in-

creasing problems with which we are faced in the racial field, particularly

in the development of racial intelligence concerning militant black

nationalist elements, a careful analysis of this matter has been made in

order to insure that proper emphasis is placed where needed. Also, in

order to afford better coordination over all interrelated racial security

matters (individuals and organizations) including the development of

racial informants, supervision is now being handled by the Racial

Intelligence Section of the Domestic Intelligence Division. For your

information, the Subversive Control Section is no longer in existence.

The investigation of the Communist Party and related matters other

than those with a racial aspect are being handled by the Internal Security

Section.

Our analysis of the racial informant program has shown

there is a definite need to develop additional penetrative coverage of the

militant black nationalist groups and the ghetto areas immediately to

be in a position to have maximum intelligence in anticipation of another

outburst of racial violence next summer.

In line with our objective, particular emphasis is being

placed on the development of ghetto-type racial informants. Individuals

to qualify as this type of informant must live or work in an area described

as a ghetto and, therefore, have access to pertinent racial information.

The steps necessary to qualify such an individual are as follows:

(1) The individual must have access to racial intelligence

information and must be willing to cooperate with the Bureau in furnish-

ing such information.

(2) In the absence of any derogatory information developed,

it will be necessary for you to check the following: field office indices,

FBI Identification Division records, and local credit and arrest records.

Of course, you must develop sufficient background data concerning each

prospective informant to allow an intelligent check of the foregoing

records to be made. As to the method of recommending to the Bureau

that an individual be approved as a racial informant (ghetto-type), be

guided by the instructions set out in Section 130, Volume IV, Manual

of Instructions, concerning probationary racial informants.

All individuals recommended and approved as ghetto-type

racial informants will be considered probationary racial informants

with the word "ghetto" after the informant's name or symbol. An

example of this is "John Jones, Probationary Racial Informant (Ghetto)"

or "NY 1234-R (PROB - Ghetto). "

Agents handling these ghetto-type probationary racial inform-

ants must be constantly alert for any indications of character traits or

activities of these informants which might cause embarrassment to the

Bureau. In addition, the information furnished by these informants

should not be taken at face value. A diligent attempt must be made

to verify all information furnished by these informants through other

sources and/or investigation.

In addition, immediately review all security informant files

for the purpose of determining which security informants are solely or

predominantly active in the racial field. Examples would be individuals

furnishing information concerning the Minutemen, as well as the Nation

of Islam, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Congress of

Racial Equality, and other militant black nationalist-type groups. The

security designation of these informants should be changed to the

appropriate racial informant designation. For example, a potential

security informant should be made a probationary racial informant and

a security informant should be designated as a racial informant. There-

after, they should be operated principally in the racial field and super-

vised by the Racial Informant Desk. When an informant is changed from

a security informant to a racial informant, the field classification

number should be changed to a 170 classification. Advise the Bureau

promptly as to which security informants are being converted to racial

informants.

In addition, each office having a, Black Nationalist Groups

TOPLEV Informant Program is to immediately assign at least one

Agent to work exclusively on developing informants under this Program.

Each office participating in this Program will submit at the end of a

three-month period appropriate observations as to the success of the

Program and recommendations as to its continuance.

As I have advised in the past, it is imperative and essential

that the Bureau learn of any indications of advance planning or organized

conspiracy on the part of individuals or organizations in connection

with riots and racial disturbances. You are again reminded that

informants should be alerted and directed to obtain information con-

cerning individuals who may be stockpiling firebombs, Molotov cocktails,

weapons, and to identify any groups of terrorists who may be planning

on carrying out a type of guerrilla warfare during riotous situations.

I expect each office to give this most important matter

priority attention in order to achieve our goal during the next six

months. Your efforts and results will be followed closely at the Bureau

and during field Inspections. Appropriate Manual changes will be

forthcoming.

On May 16, 1968, the Executive Conference, consisting

of Messrs. DeLoach, Mohr,

Sullivan, Tavel, Casper, Callahan,

Trotter, Conrad, Gale, Bishop, Scatterday for Rosen, Walters

for Felt, and Beaver, considered a recommendation by Assistant

Director Sullivan that a survey be made of the Negro ghetto

areas where violence has occurred or where there is a concen-

tration of militant, violence-prone, black power elements in

order to determine

the racial informant coverage in those areas.

Complete details are set out in attached memorandum and proposed

letter to all continental offices dealing with this matter.

Basically, the purpose of this survey is to enable both the

field and

the Bureau to evaluate the adequacy of informant

coverage in these areas and to pinpoint areas in which added

coverage is needed.

This assignment could be completed in each office

by one Agent

in less than one day. from information already

available in

each field division, it being noted that on every

inspection the inspector requires the field to identify its

ghetto areas.

The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend

approval for the attached letter to all continental field

divisions which contains instructions to furnish to the

Bureau information concerning ghetto-type informant coverage

in Negro ghetto areas where there has been violence or where

today there is a concentration of militant violence prone

black power elements and the adequacy of such

coverage.

By SAC Letter 67-62 (G) dated 10/17/67 captioned

"Racial Informants, Racial Matters," all offices were given

instructions and guidelines for the development of ghetto-type

racial informants in areas where potential racial violence

exists. We have aggressively followed this matterwith the

field since that time but because of the widely divergent

nature of cities across the Nation where possible racial

problems exist, we have been unable to precisely evaluate the

extent of the need of ghetto-type informants in each division.

Attached letter to all continental offices requires the submission

by each office of factual information concerning the numbers

of all Negro ghetto areas where there has been violence or

where today there is a concentration of militant violence prone

black power elements, an estimate of the population of each

such area, and statistics concerning the numbers of ghetto type

racial informants developed to cover such areas.

It also

requires that each field division advise how many ghetto

informants it believes it should have in each of the above

type ghetto areas in order to provide the coverage required

the Bureau.

Memorandum to Mr. W. C. Sullivan

RE: RACIAL INFORMANTS

Attached letter will serve two purposes. Each

office will have to make a factual survey of pertinent

aspects of the racial problem in all urban areas covered

by it. This survey will serve to drive home to each office

the size of the potential problem in each division and will

force each office to formulate concrete plans for developing

adequate informant coverage where such has not already been

done.

Secondly, the information submitted by each office

will

give the Bureau a comprehensive picture of the potential

problem in each division which will enable the Bureau to

more effectively evaluate the adequacy of the ghetto-type

racial informant program in each office. Supervisory personnel

will be able to more easily detect shortcomings and weaknesses

in any given division with this information at hand.

To obtain the information requested by this letter

should not be a burden on the field in that it should only

take the time of one Agent for less than one day to compile

the information concerning the ghetto areas from the information

already available in the field divisions. It is to be noted

that on every inspection the inspector requires the field

to identify its ghetto areas and those areas having a potential

for violence.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the attached proposed letter to all continental

field offices in accordance with the above, be approved.

RE: RACIAL INFORMANTS

Tor your guidance, the goal you should be setting

as to how many ghetto informants are needed in a particular

area is that your coverage should be such that you are completely

knowledgeable concerning all pertinent racial activities in a

particular area. The type of information you should be receiving

from your ghetto informants is advance information as to whether

anyone is planning to cause a racial disturbance, stockpiling

weapons for use during a racial disturbance, full details

concerning the activitles of militant black nationalists and

white extremists in ghetto areas, as well as any other activities

which may bring about a racial disturbance.

I expect that immediate attention will be given this

matter and also expect that the Bureau will be kept advised

of progress being made in this field. Progress will be followed

closely and the desired cesults are expected to be produced.

PURPOSE:

To obtain authority to send the attached letter to

all Special Agents in Charge changing the maximum permissible

period between contacts with ghetto-type racial informants

from two weeks, as presently required by the Manual of

Instructions, to one month.

BACKGROUND:

The ghetto-type racial informant program was

established in October, 1967, to develop sources living or

working in ghetto areas who are in a position to keep the

Bureau advisedof situations of potential violence.

Ghetto-

type racial informants are distinguished from regular racial

informants in that they are not associated with or reporting

regularly on black extremists. Their primary purpose is to

detect and report on all violence-prone elements, activities,

and situations in ghetto areas which could spark riots or

assist black extremists in any way.

REGULAR RACIAL INFORMANTS STILL CONTACTED AT LEAST EVERY

TWO WEEKS:

No change in present Manual of Instructions require-

ments that regular racial informants be contacted at least

once every

two weeks is contemplated.

Because of the rapport

established with ghetto-type racial informants, the field is

often able to direct such informants into membership in or

association with black extremist groups.

case, these individuals are converted from ghetto-type racial

informants to regular racial informants.

If approval is given

to extend the maximum period between contacts with established

gnetto-type racial intormants to one month, any such informant

Who is converted to a regular racial informant will again be

subject to the requirement that he be contacted at least once

every two weeks.

OBSERVATIONS:

Laborers,

cLerks, nousewives, busInessmen, anc

numerous other types of individuals are developed as ghetto

type racial informants.

Frequent initial contacts with each

such individual are necessary (1) to establish adequate rapport,

(2) to insure that each such individual is fully aware of the

nature of and the seriousness of his assignments,

and (3) to

estabLish adequate channels ot communications suitable iol

use at any time.

Once these goals are achieved, the informant

can be considered established and contacts every two weeks are

no longer necessary since the primary purpose of each such

informant is to remain alert to information of value and promptly

relay same. Once a ghetto-type racial informant is established,

contacts once each month will be adequate. To definitely fix

the time at which a ghetto-type racial informant is considered

establisned, the Special Agent handling this informant will be

required to place a memorandum in informant's file stating

that requirements (1),

(2), and (3), mentioned above, have been

met and

that informant is considered established.

SAVINGS FROM LENGTHENING PERIOD BETWEEN CONTACTS:

As of August 1, 1968, there were 3,248 ghetto-

New Informants

this type informant are presently required to contact each such

individual at least once every two weeks, there are a minimum

of 6,496 contacts being made each month.

Even if a contact

Lasts but a few minutes,

the manpower expenditure is considerable.

It the maximum permissible period between contacts is extended

to one month, manpower expenditures will be cut in half.

ACTION:

It approved, attached letter to all Special Agents

in Charge will be sent in accordance with the above and appropriate

Manual changes will be prepared.

(E) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- Effective immediately,

the maximum permissible period between contacts with established ghetto-

type racial informants is extended from two weeks to one month. Prior

to the time that you consider an individual as an established ghetto-type

informant, you must continue to make contacts with that individual at

least once every two weeks. A ghetto-type racial informant is to be

considered established only after he has been contacted a sufficient

number of times (1) to insure that good rapport exists between the con-

tacting Special Agent and the individual concerned, (2) to insure that the

individual concerned is fully aware of the nature and seriousness of the

matters assigned to him, and (3) to establish adequate channels of com-

munication suitable for use at any time. To definitely fix the time at

which a ghetto-type racial informant is considered established, the

Special Agent handling the informant must place a memorandum in

informant's file stating that requirements (1), (2), and (3), mentioned

above, have been met.

Purpose of this memorandum is to obtain approval Ior

attached letter to all continental field offices instructing

that the Ghetto Racial Informant Program in each office be analyzed

/ in detail to insure that each field office is obtaining the full

potential from is network of ghetto informants.

We are presently operating 4,469 ghetto informants

throughout the United States.

These informants are producing

valuable racial information on a regular basis. For example, during

the past year ghetto informants were able to furnish information

which was given to the local police and was helpful in containing

racial disturbances. In addition, since

April, 1969, our informants

have been responsible for bringing about the arrest of 283

individuals (195 local and 88" Federal

arrests) and have been.

responsible for salting 63 other cases, and recoveries valued

at $82,038.40.

Although the ghetto informant program is productive,

review has clearly shown that certain field offices are getting

far more results from their ghetto informants than others.

In

view of this it is believed every "s ffice should analyze

their progran.

The attached letter to all continental field offices

instructs each field office to analyze their ghetto intormant

program and we are furnishing: several guidelines for theil

The Ghetto Racial Informant Program was instituted

on 10/11/67 for the purpose of obtaining information concerning

situations in the ghettos which might erupt into racial violence

as well as for the purpose of obtaining infornation concerning

extremist activity in the ghetto areas. This program has been

productive to date; however, a review of the program in the

various field divisions has show that certain field divisions

are getting more results from their ghetto informants than

others. In view of this, each field division should analyze

its - particular ghetto racial informant program to insure that

informants are producing infornation on a regular basis.

In the event an informant is not producing information on a

regular basis the case should be closed ard a new more productive

Informant should be developed.

The attendees at the recent Specialized Training of

¡Bureau Personnel conferences concerning informant matters recommended

that instructions be furnished to the field to the effect that

in addition to having ghetto informants as listening posts, a

larger percentage of these informants be given direction so that

Ithey will be actively seeking racial information on a regular basis.

The Ghetto Informant Program was instituted in July, 1967,

in order that the Bureau would have access to pertinent racial

information in the ghetto areas in anticipation of outbursts of

racial violence. This program has proven to be very successful;

however, it was noted that some field divisions were operating

their ghetto informants as listening posts and other divisions

were actively operating the ghetto informants by giving them

positive assignments.

5-Dlaheriv

It is noted we are presently operating 4,520 ghetto

informants and it is essential that we have some operated as

listening posts but we would also achieve greater efficiency

if the greater number of these informants were given positive

assignments in the racial field.

These assignments would include

attendance at public meetings held by extremists, surveys of

extremist bookstores, verification of residence and employment

of Agitator and Security Index subjects who may live or work

in ghetto areas, identification of extremists who may be agitating

in a local area, as well as furnishing information concerning the

activities of youth gangs operating in the area when these activities

may tend to increase racial tensions. In addition, ghetto informants

because of their access to criminal information, could furnish

information concerning both Federal and local crimes./ '

Index subjects who may live or work in ghetto areas,

identification of extremists who may be agitating in a local

area, as well as furnishing information concerning the

activities of youth gangs operating in the area when these

activities may tend to increase racial tensions.

It is recognized that certain Individuals presently

being operated as ghetto informants would be more useful in

their role as listening posts; therefore, they should be

continued as such.

In line with the above, each ghetto racial informant

file should be reviewed in connection with the regular review

of ghetto informant files in order to determine whether the informan

should be operated

as a listening post or whether he should be

given positive assignments as set out above.

In the future development of ghetto racial informants

you should strive to obtain quality ghetto informants,

particularly the type which can be operated so they will be

actively seeking racial information in their ghetto areas.

It is to be noted that when ghetto informants are furnishing

information on a regular basis concerning extremist activity

they should be designated as probationary racial informants

and the ghetto designation deleted. An aggressive and

imaginative approach to the Ghetto Informant Program will

enhance the overall Racial Informant Program in every

field division by producing on a regular basis, individuals

who can be directed to positions where they will have access

to pertinent racial information on a regular basis.

To obtain authority to revise current policy with

regard to the administrative handling of the Ghetto Informant

Program.

The Ghetto Informant Program instituted in July, 196%,

Ior the purpose of providing the Bureau with in-depth racial

coverage in ghetto areas.

We currently operate 4520 ghetto

informants throughout the Nation.

This informant program is

productive with its value having been clearly established. We

have been exploring methods to administratively streamline this

program to reduce paperwork and

correspondence; in this regaro

it was suggested during a recent Specialized Training of Bureau

Personnel conference concerning informant matters that we

discontinue the classification of probationary ghetto informants

and

permit Special Agents in Charge to authorize and supervise

all ghetto informants within their respective territories requir

ing that only a number count be included in the monthly racial

Current policy requires that removal of the proba-

tionary status on ghetto informants be on Bureau authority

after notification that specific requirements have been met.

Proposed plan eliminates necessity for the probationary status

and.will place all ghetto informants in one classification

upon completion of necessary requirements on SAC approval.

The recommended procedure will materially reduce correspondence

between the field and the Bureau.

Additionally above

recommendation eliminates the necessity for the currently

required two-week contact with probationary ghetto informants

which was necessary at the beginning of the program and will

place all ghetto informants under a thirty-day contact rule

To obtain authority to revise current policy with regard

to maintenance of subfiles concerning ghetto informants.

As a result of recent specialized training of Bureau

personnel conferences concerning racial matters, it was recomnended

that the maintenance of field office subfiles concerning ghetto in-

formants be left to the option of the Special Agent in Charge (SAC).

Current policy requires that reports written or oral

(reduced to writing) from racial informants including ghetto

informants be filed in a field office subfile. Many ghetto

informants serve only as "listening posts" and often furnish only]

information to the effect all is quiet. This type of information

is considered positive information and

according to current re-

quirements a copy of the report should be placed in the informant

subfile along with a copy in the racial situation control file.

In view of the nature of "listening post" type infor-

mation it is believed sufficient to place a copy of the report in

the racial situation control file, thereby eliminating the

necessity for its inclusion in a subfile.

The above policy change

is considered a streamlining device materially reducing paper work

currently involved in the maintenance of the ghetto files and will

increase the efficiency of our operation.

RECOMMENDATION:

= D-

That the attached SAC Letter in accordance with/above

• be approved and sent to all SACs.

If approved, appropriate

Manual changes will be prepared.

(D) GHETTO INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- As a result of re-

cent conferences concerning racial informants held at the Seat of Govern-

ment, it has been recommended

and approved that ghetto informants be

approved on the authority of the Special Agent in Charge and that the

probationary status of these informants will no longer be necessary.

Current policy requires that before a ghetto informant can be removed

from a probationary status the Bureau must be advised that certain

specific requirements have been satisfied; thereafter, Bureau authori-

zation is given to remove the probationary status of the informant. You

will no longer be required to advise the Bureau of the identity of the

ghetto informants and your only requirement will be to give the number

of ghetto informants currently being operated by your office at the time

you submit your monthly racial informant status report.

Current investigation required concerning development

of ghetto informants will remain in effect and it will be the responsi-

bility of each SAC to assure the necessary requirements are fulfilled

before approving these informants.

In addition to the above change it will no longer be necessary

to contact any ghetto informants on a two-week basis as was required in

the handling of probationary ghetto informants. You are now required

to contact ghetto informants on a 30-day basis.

The above changes do not affect your requirements to ob-

tain Bureau authority concerning ghetto informants who will be utilized

in connection with educational institutions.

The above changes should materially ease the administrative

handling of your Ghetto Informant Program and provide you with more

time to develop additional productive ghetto informants throughout your

territory.

Appropriate Manual changes are forthcoming.

E) RACIAL INFORMANTS - GHETTO INFORMANTS -- As a result of recent

racial informant conferences held at the Seat of Government, a recom-

mendation was made and approved giving the Special Agent in Charge

(SAC) the option of maintaining subfiles concerning ghetto informants.

As you are aware, current policy concerning subfiles relating

to ghetto informants requires that a subfile be maintained on all ghetto

informants regardless of whether or not they are furnishing only "listen-

ing post"' type information. Effective immediately, the maintenance of a

subfile for your ghetto informants is being left to the option of the SAC.

There is little reason to maintain a subfile on those ghetto informants

who are used primarily as "listening posts" and furnish information con-

cerning attitudes and tensions within a ghetto area. It will suffice to

place a copy of the report (FD-209) in the racial situation control file,

thereby eliminating its inclusion in a subfile.

Subfiles may be necessary in those instances when ghetto

informants are reporting valuable substantive information.

Appropriate Manual change forthcoming.

This is to justify the continuance of captioned program

in view of the fact that this program is producing substantial

accomplishments in the actal field on a regular basis a ge

The Ghetto Informant Program was instituted by memorandum

G. C. Moore to Mr. W. C. Sullivan, dated 10-11-67, captioned

"Racial Informants, Racial Matters." A ghetto informant is an

individual who resides or works in an area described as a ghetto

and can furnish pertinent general racial information. At the

present time we are operating 5,178 ghetto informants and as of

6-1-69 we were operating 4,067 ghetto informants. This is an

increase of 1,11l ghetto informants in the past year.

During the past year ghetto informants have been responsible

not only for obtaining valuable racial intelligence in the ghetto

areas but also for bringing about the arrest of 76 individuals, 43

on Federal charges and 33 on local charges. In addition, these

informants were responsible for solving 88 other cases, nine of

which were Federal and 79 local as well as bringing about

recoveries valued in excess of $67, 660. The types of cases

involved in this were bank robberies, mail robberies, stolen

automobiles, deserters, narcotics, assaults and general fugitive

matters.

As to the racial intelligence furnished by ghetto

informants during the past year it has been responsible for not

only preventing racial violence in certain areas but also for

identifying those individuals who have perpetrated violent acts

in connection with racial disturbances. These informants have

also furnished information concerning acquisitions of firearms

by racial extremists as well as information concerning individuals

who were attempting to form Black Panther groups in certain areas.

;Following is set forth to show the difference between a

racial informant and a ghetto

A racial informant is an individual who is

furnishing information on a confidential basis concerning

extremist groups (black or white) as well as information

concerning individuals who are members of these groups.

A ghetto informant is an individual who lives

or works in a ghetto

" area and has access to information

regarding the racial situation and racial activities in

his area which he furnishes to the Bureau on a confidential

basis.

The difference between the above types of informants

is that the racial informant is targeted towards extremist

organizations and their members whereas the ghetto informant

furnishes general racial information and is not a member of

an extremist group.

+6-2514-11-219X

At the present time we are operating 953 racial

informants and 6,024 ghetto informants.

The combination

of these two types of sources gives us a combined total of

6,977 individuals who are furnishing racial information to

the Bureau.

•To obtain approval for attached airtel to all field

offices concerning the advising of the Bureau of symbol

numbers assigned to ghetto racial informants.

5. 1601

SAC Letter 71-19 (C) dated 5-4-71 set out that a

symbol number designation should be afforded to all

individuals from the time any steps are taken to develop

them as any type of Bureau source. This letter instructed

that the Bureau should be advised concerning the symbol

number assigned by secure teletype.

Ghetto informants are approved by the authority

of the Special Agent in Charge and the identity of the

ghetto informant is not normally furnished to the Bureau.

In such cases as it is necessary for the Bureau to obtain

the identity of a particular ghetto informant, this is done

by individual communication.

Accordingly, it is not believed necessary for the

field to advise the Bureau of the symbol numbers assigned

to individual ghetto informants.

ACTION:

That attached airtel instructing the field not to

advise Bureau of the symbol numbers assigned to ghetto

informants unless an unusual situation occurs be approved.

Purpose of this memorandum is to advise concerning

the racial Ghetto Informant Program in respect to the article

which appeared in Sunday's 7/4/71 edition of "The Washington

Post" highlighting this Program.

"The Washington Post" article captioned "Analysis

oi Stolen FBI Documents Provides Glimpse of Bureau at Work,"

(copy of which is attached), sets out the Bureau instituted

a new program "ghetto informants" to cover the ghettos of

America. The analysis in the article is based on the

stolen documents from the Media, Pennsylvania, Resident Agency.

The article sets forth that some of the specific

assignments were to attend and report on open meetings of

knowit or suspected black extremists, visit black Afro-type

bookstores to determine if extremist literature is available

and report on changes of the attitudes of the Negro community

toward the white community which may lead to racial violence.

The Ghetto Informant Program was instituted in

October, 1967, by memorandum dated 10/11/67 from G. C. Moore

to Mr. W. C.

Sullivan captioned "Racial Informant, Racial Natters."

It was recommended and approved that the Bureau develop sources

• Memorandum to Mr. C. D. Brennan

Re: Ghetto Informant Program

This Program has been productive in furnishing racial

intelligence information which has been iesponsible for not

only preventing racial violence but also identifying individuals

who have perpetrated act of violence during racial disturbances,

identifying individuals attempting to sell explosives,

individuals who participated in firebombings as well as

reporting on the activities while racial disturbances were

occurring.

In addition, these ghetto informants along with all

our racial informants from January to May 31, 1971, were

responsible for bringing about the arrest of 237 individuals,

23771, verduals,

on both local and Federal charges, 64 of which were FBI

fugitives, as well as being responsible for the recovery of

$63,865 in stolen merchandise.

OBSERVATIONS:

The Ghetto Informant Program is a sound program even

if the liberal press such as "The Washington Post" using

stolen documents attempts to imply that the Bureau through

this Program is checking on every black living in a ghetto

area. Such a task would be impossible. At the present time

we have 6,301 ghetto informants throughout the U.S. These

are mostly Negro individuals who are cooperating with the

Bureau in order to help fight the extremist and criminal

elements in their neighborhoods which jeopardize and disrupt

the law abiding Negro citizen.

This Frogram is analyzed on a regular basis through

field inspections, inspection of the Seat of Government and

through supervision by the Domestic Intelligence Division.

In view of the need for racial intelligence that is provided

by the Program and its productivity, we will continue to

operate it in accordance with Bureau standards.

ACTION: For information.

In order to increase the productivity of the Ghetto

Informant Program, there is attached for approval an airtel to

all continental field offices instructing that each Special Agent

in Charge (SAC) thoroughly evaluate the Ghetto Informant Program

in his respective division and submit recommendations for

improving the program in line with the guidelines set forth by

the Bureau.

The Ghetto Informant Program was instituted 10-11-67.

A ghetto informant is an individual who resides or works in an

area described as a ghetto and can furnish general information

concerning extremist activity. When originally instituted, the

ghetto informant was mainly a listening post; however, with the

change in extremist activities, a good number of these informants

were given positive assignments, which assignments definitely

increased the productivity in certain field divisions.

At the present time we are operating 6,541 ghetto

informants. This is a valuable reservoir of individuals who

•should be elevated into positions in extremist organizations.

In addition, by increasing the productivity of the ghetto

informants, the Bureau will be in a position of obtaining

additional criminal statistics.

Wi

It is to be noted that in addition to obtaining

information concerning extremist activities, the ghetto informants

along with other extremist informants since January 1, 1971, have

been responsible for bringing about the arrest of 445 individuals on

both local and Federal charges, 127 of which were FBI fugitives, as

well as being responsible for the recovery of $193,181.28 in

stolen merchandise. With the increase in extremist activity as

seen by the disturbances in penal institutions, the unprovoked

attacks against police and the definite trend concerning

guerrilla warfare throughout the U.S., we must accelerate our

penetration of extremist groups.

Accordingly, in order to fully utilize our vast

reservoir of ghetto informants, it is believed each SAC should

be instructed to evaluate the Ghetto Informant Program in his

division along the following lines.

I. Ascertain the number of ghetto informants that

have been elevated into extremist organizations. 2. Determine

what percentage of the ghetto informants are given positive

assignments on a regular basis. 3. Evaluate the extremist

intelligence accomplishments of the ghetto informants in the

particular field division.

4. Evaluate the criminal

statistical accomplishments. 5. Set forth specific steps

being taken to not only increase the productivity of the

Ghetto Informant Program but also the steps being taken to

elevate the ghetto informants into extremist organizations.

Upon receipt of the above from each continental field

office, analysis will be made and appropriate instructions will

be furnished all field divisions concerning the future handling

of ghetto informants.

ACTION:

That attached airtel to all continental field offices

be approved furnishing instructions concerning the ghetto

informants as set out above.

The evaluation of the ghetto informant program made by

each continental field division clearly shows that there is a

definite relationship between the accomplishments of this program

and the percentage of ghetto informants being given positive

assignments!

In addition, the ghetto informant program has proven to

a most productive program not only in the extremist intelligence

be

field but it has also shown that ghetto informants can be helpful

obtaining criminal statistical accomplishments. Since 2/1/71 ghetto

informants have been responsible for bringing about the arrest of

bringing about the recovery of $49,999.

In view of the increase of guerrilla warfare activity on

the part of black extremists, it is necessary that we develop

additional informant coverage to obtain information concerning this

activity..

community (ghetto areas); therefore, our ghetto informants

must be targeted to obtain information concerning this

guerrilla warfare activity.

In order to fulfill our responsibilities in this

field, each field division must promptly improve both the

number and quality of ghetto informants in accordance with the

guidelines set forth below: (1) New ghetto informants

developed must be the type who can obtain information concerning

black extremists who are operating in the ghetto areas and

planning or perpetrating guerrilla-type activities such as

robberies, attacks on police, and other violent activities;

(2) The recent survey of ghetto informants showed that the

productivity of the program in each field office was in direct

relation to the percentage of ghetto informants being given

positive assignments. Those field divisions achieving greater

productivity are the ones who had a greater percentage of their

ghetto informants being given positive assignments. Accordingly,

on your FD-405b setting forth your extremist informant accomplish-

ments you must set forth the percentage of your ghetto informants

being given positive assignments.

Each ghetto informant must be evaluated on a yearly

basis; and if it is determined that the informant has not

produced positive extremist intelligence-type information, which

information would include criminal-type information, the informant

must be closed and a new ghetto informant developed.

It is expected that the quality and quantity of ghetto

informants will be improved in the near future in order that the

Bureau may fulfill its responsibilities in the extremist

intelligence field.

Purpose of this memorandum is to obtain approval for

attached airtel to all continental field offices instructing that

the extremist ghetto informant program be upgraded in accordance

with the guidelines set out in order to increase the productivity

of this program and to obtain information concerning the present

phase of extremist activity, namely, the guerrilla warfare phase.

By airtel dated 9/22/71 all continental field offices

were instructed to evaluate the ghetto informant program. These

evaluations have been received and reviewed.

The review clearly

shows that those field offices giving the majority of their ghetto

informants positive assignments are achieving not only positive

intelligence information but also valuable criminal statistical

accomplishments.

These informants, since 2/1/71, have been

responsible for bringing about the arrest of Ill individuals, 51

of which were Bureau fugitives, and the recovery of $49,199 In

stolen merchandise, weapons, and cars.

In addition, we are now seeing another phase of extremist

activity, that is the guerrilla warfare phase, as opposed to the

mass demonstrations which occurred in the past.

Extremists are

involved in expropriations (robberies), killing of police,

and other terroristic activities.

The extremists involved in

guerrilla warfare have very limited or no contact with the

aboveground extremist organizations; therefore, our coverage has

been limited in this respect.

The guerrilla operates within the

community (the ghetto area), and this is the area where we also

operate our ghetto informants; therefore, our ghetto informants

i should be targeted, toward developing information concerning acts

¡of guerrilla warfare.

This is to justify continuance of captioned program

in view of the fact that this program is producing substantial

accomplishments in the extremist field on a regular basis.

During the past year these informants have furnished

intelligence information concerning extremist activities which

has brought about the arrest of Black Panther Party (BPP) members

on armed robbery charges, identified individuals responsible for

a fire bombing of a food store, identified individuals who have

been involved in murder cases, as well as information which

brought about the recovery of weapons and ammunition, and

information which has been of assistance to local police in

handling civil disturbances.

While the primary objective of the ghetto informant

program is to obtain information concerning extremist activities,;

it also provides substantial accomplishments in the criminal

field in that these informants either live or work in ghetto

areas which are usually high crime areas. During the period

7/1/71 to 4/30/72 ghetto informants were responsible for bringing

about the arrest of 305 individuals (174 local and state, 131

Federal), of whom 85 were FBI fugitives. In addition, these

informants were responsible for the recovery of $174,994'

occur in the form of disturbances and riots. As the program

progressed it was noted that these informants could be operated

in such a manner to increase their value by giving them positive

assignments to develop information concerning black extremists

who are operating in ghetto areas and planning or perpetrating

guerrilla-type activities such as robberies, attacks on police,

and other violent activities. In addition, the field has

constantly been reminded of the potential of ghetto informants

to obtain criminal information in addition to the extremist

intelligence, and this has paid off as indicated above.

Information has recently been developed indicating

black extremists are obtaining funds by robbing narcotics

dealers. Accordingly, the

field has been instructed to target

ghetto informants specifically toward ascertaining the identities

of narcotics dealers in their particular areas as well as

obtaining information concerning plans of black extremists to

rob these individuals.

The ghetto informant program is a sound program and

is analyzed on a regular basis through field inspections,

inspections at FBI Headquarters, and through supervision by

the Domestic Intelligence Division. In view of the need for

extremist intelligence information provided by this program

and its productivity, it is believed this program should be

continued, and it will be reevaluated in July, 1973.

ACTION:

If approved, this program will be continued and

rejustified in July, 1973.

ghetto informant program which will reduce the number of ghetto

informants by fifty per cent without impairing the efficiency

of the operation.

• After careful analysis of the ghetto informant pro-

gram during the recent inspection of the Domestic Intelligence

Division, it was concluded that a modified ghetto informant pro-

gram would streamline and improve efficiency of the existing

program. This will be achieved by having only Special Agents

assigned to extremist matters handling ghetto informants.

Experience has shown that Special Agents experienced in extremist

matters are in a better position to achieve maximum use of ghetto

informants.

Growing civil unrest in the mid-1960s created an urgent

need for a comprehensive network of "listening post" type sources

within ghetto areas to provide advance intelligence information

relating to civil unrest.

To fill this need the ghetto informant

program was initiated on October 11, 1967. The ghetto informant

program proved highly successful and subsequently these informants

were directed to areas of greater responsibility in addition to

their "listening post" function. A notable byaraquct these

informants has been their ability to furnish highly significant

criminal information.

Re: Ghetto Informant Program

explosive element smol ldering within the ghetto areas throughout

the Nation. This volatile force, more sophisticated than in the

past, frequently surfaces in the form of urban guerrilla terrorist-

type activities often by unaffiliated extremists, resulting in the

sniping and killing of police, firebombings, and other violent

criminal activities. The current threat of

civil unrest in the

ghetto is perhaps an even greater menace to our society than the

unrest we have witnessed in the past. To cope with this continuing

undercurrent, a more selective ghetto informant program is necessary.

The primary purpose of our modified ghetto informant pro-

gram is to provide a highly selective corps of "listening post"

informants versed in the type of information desired by the Bureau

which will assure we are abreast of growing civil unrest and

developing extremist activities. This can best be accomplished

by having ghetto informants exclusively handled by those Special

Agents assigned to extremist matters.

Inasmuch as ghetto informants

generally work or reside in high crime areas and frequently associ-

ated with the criminal element, we will continue to encourage the

acceptance of criminal information coming to the attention of these

informants.

While we expect a fifty percent decrease in the 7,514

ghetto informants currently being operated, the modified ghetto

informant program in no way diminishes the responsibility of the

Special Agent in Charge (SAC) to have "listening post" type sources

in those ghetto areas where there is a potential for civil unrest

or extremist activity. In addition, the SAC will be instructed to

carefully analyze each current ghetto informant and those with the

best potential to be retained as ghetto informants or elevated to

probationary extremist informant and others, if appropriate, redesig-i

nated as criminal informants or discontinued.

Some SACs have levied an arbitrary rule requiring Special

Agents, regardless of assignment, to develop ghetto informants. We

will give instructions to insure this practice is discontinued.

RECOMMENDATION: That attached SAC memorandum, in accordance

with above, be approved and sent.

-c::

A request to reduce the number of ghetto informants by fifty

percent, which gives the appearance of being an arbitrary figure,

AGREE

immediately suggests the need to explore thoroughly the merits of the

ghetto informant program and to consider what, if any; more practical

alternatives might exist.

An informant who is classified as a ghetto informant, as dis-

tinguished from a criminal, security, potential security or extremist

informant, appears to be one who is expected to provide advance

intelligence information relating to civil unrest. In evaluating the

program, it is therefore important to know of each instance since the

program was begun on Ocotber 11, 1967, in which intelligence informa-

tion prior to an urban riot or upheaval was obtained from a ghetto

informant.

I am not referring to criminal and security information. If

the information from a ghetto informant fits within one of these two

categories, it would seem more plausible for the informant to be

carried as a criminal, a security, a potential security or an extremist

informant.

Only if he has furnished intelligence information concerning

an urban riot or upheaval should an informant be designated as a

ghetto informant.

SLIA. REC43 - 110.099

2420 NOV E1972

Classifying the informant as a ghetto informant whim anyo

information obtained from him falls only within the criminal or security

field is not a mere matter of semantics. It seems apparent from the

Agents Handbook, Part I, pp. 20a and 20b, that carrying a person as a

ghetto informant involves a vast expenditure of Agent and clerical time.

There has to be a background investigation, at least one contact a month

and, in some instances, progress letters to the Bureau every six months.

Memorandum for Mr. Gray

Re: Ghetto Informant Program

Extremist Matters

Although I have not seen the answers to the question referred

to above as to the instances in which ghetto informants have furnished the

type information which was expected of them when the program was

established, my initial opinion is that the ghetto informant program has

not produced any information which could not be obtained by (1) regular

debriefing of criminal, security, potential security, and extremist

informants; (2) liaison with local police departments who, as a part of

the increasing emphasis upon better police-community relations, are

much closer to the pulse of the local ghetto community than may have

been the case heretofore, and who have probably always been closer to

the ghetto than the FBI could ever hope to be; and (3) volunteered

information from interested citizens.

The last paragraph of the Moore to Miller memorandum of

9/8/72 impliedly suggests what I believe to be the major justification

for continuing a separate program under the heading of ghetto informants.

SACs do not levy an arbitrary rule requiring SA's to develop ghetto

informants unless the SACs, rightly or wrongly, believe the Headquarters

expects a certain caseload of ghetto informants from their respective

offices.

The suspicion that it is the caseload concept which underlies

much of the current discussion about the ghetto informant program in

the aftermath of the recent inspection of DID is increased by the proposed

cutback of fifty percent, which, as previously indicated, appears to be

a somewhat arbitrary figure.

You should know in advance what the consequences would be as

far as the budget is concerned if the ghetto informant program, which

has undoubtedly accounted for a significant number of cases, were dis-

continued. If those consequences include a drastic cut in funds, you of

course can not be oblivious to them, but, at the risk of sounding naive,

I would hope that the future of this program can be decided solely on the

basis of the program's merit or lack thereof without regard to the case-

load factor.

Re Dave Kinley's note about our discussing this matter,

I believe I heard at the SAC Conference on 9/26 that DID was going

to poll the Field to get the views of SAC's and I got the impression

that DID, upon receipt of these comments from the Field, might

wish to revise the proposed SAC Memorandum which was the

subject of the 9/8/72 memorandum from Mr. Moore to you.

If there is to be a revised proposal from DID in light of

comments from the Field and the comments of Mr. Gray, it may

be that our discussion would take a substantially different form than

if it occurred now. Therefore, I suggest that the meeting contemplated

by Mr. Kinley not occur until after you have had a chance to poll the

Field and consider the comments of Mr. Gray.

-236

The ghetto informant program was instituted on 10/11/67,

to fulfill an urgent need to develop a network of "listening posts"

in the ghetto areas of our cities.

Ghetto informants are those

persons living or working in ghetto areas who could furnish

Intormation concerning the potential for riots and violent civil

unrest. As the field gained experience in the handling of these

informants, their value steadily increased. The "listening post"

concept was expanded and ghetto informants are now utilized

to

attend public meetings held by extremists, to identify extremists

passing through or locating in

the ghetto area, to identify

purveyors of extremist literature as well as given specific assign-

ments where appropriate. A valuable by-product of the ghetto.

informant program has been their ability to furnish highly

Significant criminal information.

In addition, our ghetto informant

program has been a proven reservoir of productive extremist

informants who have been elevated from the ghetto informan't ranks.

We currently operate 7,482 ghetto informants.

informants are developed and handled by field agents regardless

of their assignment, whether it be criminal, extremist, or

security. During the recent inspection of the Domestic

efficiency of the existing program. This was to be achieved

by having only Special Agents assigned to extremist matters

handle ghetto informants and instructing the SACs to reduce

modified program has not been approved.

As a result of the number of views expressed during

the SAC conference on 9/26/72, concerning the appropriate

utilization of ghetto informants, there is a need to obtain

the opinion of all SACs before considering modifying the

existing program. Accordingly, there is attached an airtel to

all SACs with instructions to promptly analyze their ghetto

The Bureau is currently considering modifying the ghetto

informant program for the purpose of achieving greater efficiency

and maximum utilization of these informants while carefully preserv.

ing the "Ilstening post" concept of the program.

One proposed change to the ghetto informant program

recommends a reduction in the number of these informants by fifty

percent and the handling of these informants exclusively by Special

Agents assigned to extremist matters. This proposal emphasizes

quality and the closing, where appropriate, or redesignation of

those informants best suited as extremist, criminal or security

intormants.

The proposed modification of the ghetto Informant program

was discussed during the 9/26/72 session of the Special Agent in

Charge (SAC) conference held at FBI Headquarters. A number of

opinions were expressed as to the value of ghetto informants in

enabling each office to fill its responsibility in the extremist

field.

It was agreed that further study of the program is necessary

before initiating any modification of the program.

Re: Ghetto Informant Program

captioned "Upgrading Extremist Ghetto Informant Program."

This airtel requires that ghetto informants be the type of

individuals who can obtain information concerning black

extremists who are operating in the ghetto areas and planning

or perpetrating guerrilla-type activities such as robberies,

attacks on police, and other violent activities. Our current

ghetto informant program requires that these informants be

given positive assignments and that they be evaluated on a

yearly basis in order to close the unproductive informant.

To assist the Bureau in determining what changes,

if any, should be made to the existing ghetto informant

program, you are instructed to carefully analyze your ghetto

informant program in line with the following points and sub-

mit your recommendations to reach the Bureau by 10/9/72.

Bear in mind our purpose is to have a uniform program to

best do the job intended:

1) Retain current program without modification.

2) Adopt the proposed change set out above calling

for a fifty percent reduction in the number of ghetto

informants. Should you disagree with the fifty percent

reduction, submit your recommendation concerning the

percent of reduction you consider appropriate with an

explanation as to how you arrived at your conclusion.

Bear in mind that quality is difficult without

quantitative measurement.

3)

Other changes believed necessary.

4)

Abolish the ghetto program in its entirety.

If you recommend the program be abolished, submit

specific alternate program you recommend to obtain

the intelligence information now being developed by

ghetto informants.

The purpose of the memorandum is to secure

approval of a letter to all offices modifying instructions

concerning the ghetto informant program.

A survey of all field offices relative to the

ghetto informant program has been completed.

The field overwhelmingly expressed a desire to

continue the program; however, a number of suggestions were

offered to modify certain aspects of it.

Based upon a review of the results of this survey (/

the following recommendations are made:

1)

The number of informants operated under this

program should definitely be governed by the needs of a

specific office as determined by the Special Agent in Charge

(SAC). Attached letter will instruct each office to conduct

an analysis to determine its needs and only those informants

absolutely necessary to fulfill the needs of the office are

to be operated.

The letter will also instruct that this

program is not to be utilized as a device to increase the

office case load.

some offices actually do not have "ghetto" areas but do

have certain geographical locations of potential civil

As of September 1, 1972, we were operating 7,482

ghetto informants. It is not possible to determine at this

time the number of these informants that we will end up with

based on the instructions set forth in attached letter.

However, we anticipate a decrease from the existing level.

OBSERVATION: There have been a variety of opinions expressed

in the past on the value of the ghetto informant program and,

• in fact, we have utilized a discussion of this program to

"warm up" Agent conferences and in-service classes because

of the lively discussion it generates.

The recently completed

survey, however. shows that only four offices were in favor

of doing away with the existing ghetto informant program.

It is obvious

that this program is considered to be of con-

tinuing value to our field offices.

Re: Ghetto Informant Program

Target most

It has been said that there has not been a single

instance where a ghetto informant has furnished significant

information pertaining to civil unrest.

This is a mis-

conception because, in fact, since the inception of this

program there have been numerous times that these informants

have furnished significant information concerning civil

unrest. Examples of a few of these are as follows:

A Memphis ghetto intormant identified four Negro

males who had assaulted and stabbed a high school teacher

which lead to their arrest and resulted in the quieting

of a potentially riotous situation.

A Minneapolis ghetto

informant identified participants

involved in a disturbance

at the University of Minnesota. A Jackson ghetto informant

provided pertinent information concerning a disturbance at

Jackson State College and identified four individuals

setting fires on the campus.

This informant also identified

individuals leading a mob of 100 persons attacking the

Reserve Officer Training Corps Building on that campus.

Ghetto informants of the Knoxville Office furnished informa-

tion on black extremists extorting money from white merchants

with the threat of fire bombing their stores if they failed

to cooperate. A Norfolk ghetto informant furnished informa-

tion that a gathering of 200 young blacks had 40 fire bombs

which they intended to use.

Local authorities credited this

information with avoiding a

massive civil disturbance.

A

Springfield ghetto informant identified an individual attempt-

ing to sell a large quantity of explosives for use in creating

a civil disturbance.. A Tampa ghetto informant identified five

• Negroes responsible for provoking trouble at a local school.

In addition, ghetto informants have furnished a

large amount of valuable criminal information which is perhaps

best highlighted by a recent case wherein a ghetto informant

of the Oklahoma City Office furnished the information which

lead to the identification and apprehension of four subjects

in a terrorist-type slaying of a man, his wife, and a young

son.

ADDENDUM OF THE INSPECTION DIVISION L. M. WALTERS:wmj 10/24,

Ghetto Informant Program instituted 10/11/67 to fulfill a need

then recognized to develop a comprehensive network of "listening posts"

in the ghetto areas of urban centers throughout the country. Over the

succeeding years number of such informants has gradually built to some

7500 existing today. Field inspections in past year have pointed to diffic Itj

of evaluating justification for such informants because, unlike the other

informant programs (criminal, security, extremist, revolutionary

activities, and top echelon) the justification for an individual informant

cannot be supported by what he is producing. It is sufficient that ghetto

informants are geographically well dispersed and promise cooperation.

The practice of opening such cases varies widely and can be used by a

field office to effect sharp changes in total case load upward or downward,

The number of ghetto informant cases substantially affects manpower

utilization in that each ghetto informant opened requires a background

investigation and thereafter 30-day contacts.

Accordingly, during inspection (8/18 - 9/1/72) of Domestic

Intelligence Division (DID the merits of the overall program were

thoroughly reviewed and discussed. As a result, DID proposed in inspection

that hereafter assignment of such informants be limited to those Agents

assigned to extremist squads or extremist work and that SACs be instructed

to cease levying a requirement that all Agents, regardless of assignment,

must develop and operate ghetto informants. DID estimated that such a

change in the program would probably reduce the total number of such cases

by 50%.

The proposed letter to the field accomplishes little meaningiul

change. It changes the name of the program; it provides latitude to SACs

to determine extent of program within guideline that the number of

informants operated must be deemed necessary to fulfill the needs of the

• office (this has always been so); it also provides latit ude to SACs as to

whether all Agents in the office participate or only those Agents assigned to

extremist matters. Implementation of changes proposed herein would

result in an extraordinary lack of uniformity throughout the field.

The point really called into question here is whether concrete

steps should be taken to effect an overall case load reduction by sharply

reducing marginally productive cases in order to divert Agent manpower

to more productive uses in major program areas. The broader question

is currently under consideration and the results of that consideration should

HH 55180 DocId: 32989619

-Pate 835

---

## Page 836

more clearly dictate the proper approach to the Ghetto Informant

Program. Accordingly, it is recommended that any change in this

program be deferred until the overall question of case load vs.

manpower utilization is resolved.

Re memo of G. C. Moore to Mr. E. S. Miller of 10/18/72

on this subject.

The first paragraph of the Addendum of the Inspection Division

sets forth some of the considerations which have caused my skepticism

as to whether the benefits gained from this Program are sufficient to

justify the costs in terms of resource utilization attendant to the Ghetto

Informant Program.

With reference to the recommendation of the Inspection Division

that no action be taken until the overall question of caseload versus man-

power utilization is resolved, I am not certain as to the precise inquiry

currently in progress which is being referred to by the Inspection Division.

It there is such an inquiry with a view towards instructing the Domestic

Intelligence Division not to let fears as to the consequences of a reduction

in the quantity of its total caseload interfere with devoting concentrated

attention towards the most important matters within its jurisdiction, I

would be the first to applaud this inquiry.

In this regard, the problem I see with the proposed letter of

the Domestic Intelligence Division is that by giving wide latitude to SACs

to administer the Ghetto Informant Program within their respective offices,

the memorandum is not likely to accomplish meaningful change as long as

so much turns within the Bureau on the total caseload of an office. Even

though an SAC in Field Division X believes that he could terminate his

Ghetto Informant Program altogether and, by doing so, increase the

effective utilization of his personnel, he will hesitate to make such a

decision because he knows it could well result in a substantial reduction

in his total caseload, which in turn would mean that his office would lose

Agents and/or supervisors or would not be able to obtain additional Agents

and/or supervisors.

Re: Ghetto Informant Program

Extremist Matters

This is why it seems so vitally important to achieve the

by no means easy goal of finding some way to measure the needs of an

office without resort to dependence upon the total caseload of the office

because the present reliance upon caseload figure restricts the SACs

ability to make decisions, otherwise called for, which would reduce

his total caseload.

The Domestic Intelligence Division furnished to me copies of

the responses received from the Field Divisions in connection with the

Field survey concerning the Ghetto Informant Program. The information

submitted by the Newark Division so closely approximates my opinion

concerning the Ghetto Informant Program that I am attaching a copy of

was granted for the Special Agents in Charge (SAC) to approve the

There is set forth data showing that the Ghetto Informant

PROGRAM

Analysis of the then existing Security, Criminal and Extremist

Informant Programs determined that none of these existing programs could

supply the answers to the questions being asked.'

The above analysis further showed that due to the orientation

of the various informant programs mentioned above, that is, criminal

informants to obtain criminal information, security informants for

security information, and extremist informants for specific information

concerning extremist organizations and known extremist individuals,

there was still a vast area where racial unrest was rampant, namely, the

ghetto areas where there was a need

I for a "listening post" type

informant. Accordingly, the Ghetto

Informant Program

was instituted.

Comparison of Ghetto Informant Operations With Other Bureau Informant

Operations

The Security Informant Program as well as the Extremist

Informant Program require tight supervision at both Headquarters and

field level because of the extreme sensitivity of these operations.

As

previously stated, there was a need for development and rapid operation

of sources in the ghetto areas which were to be utilized as "listening

posts." In view of the nature of this operation, it was decided that the

tight supervision required by the other informant programs was not

necessary, however, it was also recognized that for any program to be

fruitful and administratively sound, there must be guidelines set out..

The guidelines formulated were based on our experiences with

the Security and Extremist Informant Programs and required that some

background checks be conducted prior to the approval of an individual as

an informant; a contact be made with the individual designated as an

informant at least once every 30 days; that any payments made to a ghetto

informant must be in accordance with Bureau policy which is also the

requirement for other informant programs.

In synopsis, it can be said that the Ghetto Informant Program

is similar to other informant programs (security and extremist) in that

there are definite guidelines set for the designation and operation of

an individual as a ghetto informant, as well as the fact payment to these

informants must conform to Bureau regulations. In short, the Ghetto

Informant Program, although operated basically as other informant

programs, does serve a separate and distinct need which our experience

has shown the other Bureau informant programs did not and could not

fill.

Memorandum to Mr. E. 'S. Miller

RE: GHETTO INFORMANT PROGRAM

- i

Comparison of the Justification of Ghetto Informants With

Justification of Other Existing Informant Programs

In the Inspection Division's addendum dated 10/24/72 to

the memorandum from G. C. Moore to E. S. Miller dated 10/18/72

concerning captioned matter, it was set out "Field inspections

in past year have pointed to difficulty of evaluating

justitication for such informants (this refers to ghetto

informants) because, unlike the other informant programs

(criminal, security, extremist, revolutionary activities, and

top echelon) the justification for an individual informant

cannot be supported by what he is producing."

The Inspection Division's difficulties have not previously

been brought to the attention of the Domestic Intelligence

Division (DID), however, this Division does not agree with the

above set out difficulty.

The statistical accomplishments of the ghetto informants

have been set out numerous times, therefore, this in itself would

assist in making a justification

for ghetto

informants; but,

it is more important that the ghetto informants be justified

by obaining information concerning potential civil unrest.

This must be considered in light of present circumstances.

While we are not experiencing the burning of the cities that

we did in the late 1960s, we are still living in a state of

erno wig, eational fees concerin the pularization of the races.

Therefore, based on our experiences, we recognized

that in reporting on the pulse of a particular area in regard

to the potential for civil unrest it is very important to

know that there is no indication of civil unrest in a particular

area at a particular time, as well as knowing that there are

indications of civil unrest.

Accordingly, the report that there

is no indication of civil unrest in a particular area is

considered positive information and should be counted as such.

In accordance with these guidelines, there does not appear to

be any difficulty in justifying the

makes reference to the practice of opening ghetto cases and

states these cases can be used by a field office to effect

sharp changes in total case load upward or downward. This

RE: GHETTO INFORMANT PROGRAM

Mr: Gray concerning the Ghetto Informant Program on 9/26/72,

to take the recommendations of the SACs, who are our leaders

in the field, then why did we bother to request their opinions?

Likewise, they certainly are entitled to know the results of

the survey and this is what we are attempting to do.

In connection with the recommendation made that any

change in this program be deferred until the overall question

of case load versus manpower utilization is resolved, there

apparently is no indication as to when this will be resolved

and further, this question should not be the deciding factor

as to whether or not there should be a Ghetto Informant Program.

Memorandum of Mr. Daniel M. Armstrong III dated November 2, 1972

Mr. Armstrong stated that in connection with the

inquiry concerning the overall question of case load versus

manpower that if there is such an inquiry with a view toward

instructing DID not to let fears as to the consequences of a

reduction in the quantity of its total case load interfere

with devoting concentrated attention towards the most important

matters within its jurisdiction, he would be the first to

applaud this inquiry.

In respect to this, DID is not aware of any fears in

connection with the above case load work load inquiry and,

further, we will always go full steam ahead to obtain the

maximum quality intelligence data needed to fulfill our

responsibilities to the United States Government, regardless

of any alleged "fears."

Mr. Armstrong stated that the problem he sees with

DID's proposed letter of 10/20/72 is that "by giving wide

latitude to SACs to administer the Ghetto Informant Program

within their respective offices, the memorandum is not likely

to accomplish meaningful change

The attached series of documents arose from DI inspection review of

Ghetto Informant Program, 8/18 - 9/1/72. Inspection Division adheres to its

position expressed in addendum to 10/18/72 memorandum attached and still feels

that the proposed letter to the field contains no meaningful change in the

operation of the Ghetto Informant Program.

Under the heading, "Need for the Ghetto Informant Program," in foregoing

memorandum (page 1, last paragraph), DID mentions questions such as "Are

these (racial) disturbances spontaneous or are they planned?", and "Are these

disturbances caused by organizations or individuals?"

', as questions asked by

high Government officials after the racial disturbances of 1967. Inspection Division

feels that advance information responsive to such intelligence needs must be

obtained from productive, well-placed Security, Revolutionary Activities, and

Extremist Informants, or as by-product information from Criminal Informants

and other sources from whom we have reasonable expectation of positive

information reporting based on past experience. Our current concept of

a Ghetto Informant includes the proprietor of a candy store or barber shop in

a ghetto (under new proposal in an urban area) who may or may not have

such information.

One such proprietor could have significant information about

an impending racial disturbance and another may not. Can we assume that our

Ghetto Informant is the local proprietor with the answer because we have

selected him in the neighborhood as a listed Ghetto Informant?

Inspection Division feels that the Ghetto Informant Program as viewed by the

DID is different from all other informant programs in at least one highly

important respect. On page 3 of the memorandum, it is stated that the report

(from a Ghetto Informant) that there is no indication of civil unrest in a particular

area is considered "positive" information and should be counted as such. Negative

information is not counted as positive information in any other informant program

and in other programs we obtain some history of the furnishing of productive in-

formation before forming a conclusion that the individual is worthy of continued

contact or further development. If we accept the views of the DID, then every

Ghetto Informant opened by an office and established for monthly contact is

capable of furnishing "positive" information because everyone is capable of

saying they do not have information indicating civil unrest.

Some Ghetto Informants have in the past furnished information in extremist

or criminal matters. This has been recognized as a by-product of the Ghetto

Informant Program.

A more meaningful approach to this whole problem might be

to concentrate more heavily in ghetto areas to develop proven Security, Extremist,

Revolutionary Activities, and Criminal Informants upon whom we can then rely to

keep us advised of civil disturbance plans as a steady by-product to the information

50180 DocId: 32989619

## Page 851

they are regularly furnishing on domestic intelligence or criminal matters.

Existing Ghetto Informants who have shown productivity in any area of FBI

jurisdiction should be converted to the appropriate substantive informant

program to which their services relate.

Further, all informants designated

in the other informant programs who are strategically located in areas of

potential civil unrest, should be briefed on supplying information that may

come to their attention relating to develing tensions and civil unrest. Such

approach would, in our view, represent a better ordering of priorities and not

have the "cart before the horse. " Moreover, we have some concern of

justifiable apprehension that might be expressed by the Congress or the public

if this program were to be described in terms out of context with our real intentions.

We could fully defend informants providing us regularly with information directly

related to our jurisdictional responsibilities and using them for "by-product"

information on civil unrest. It would be much more difficult to defend

establishment of ghetto or urban listening posts all over the country with a

possible by-product of information directly within our jurisdiction.

In our view, the Ghetto Informant Program is not a proven program and in

view of the manpower expended on it, the decision as to whether we should

keep it, modify it, or abolish it should be made after a decision is reached

concerning the oerall question of case load vs, manpower utilization now pending

in connection with a separate management study.

Re memorandum from Mr. G. C. Moore to Mr. E. S. Miller,

dated November 20, 1972, on this subject and the addendum of the Inspection

Division thereto, dated November 24, 1972.

As noted in the addendum of the Inspection Division, the Urban

Informant Program formerly known as the Ghetto Informant Program

differs from all other informant programs in that negative information is,

under this program, counted as positive information.

It would appear from Section 130 (H) (2) (b) (4) of the Manual of

Instructions that an urban informant who does nothing more than advise our

inquiring Agents that there is no indication of civil unrest in his particular

area could qualify for payments on a regular basis under Bureau authority.

In this regard, I believe it would be useful to know (1) how

many of the Bureau's present urban informants are being paid on a regular

basis, (2) of that number, how many have furnished only information to the

effect that there is no indication of civil unrest in their areas and (3) of

those urban informants not paid on a regular basis, are there documented

cases in which those informants have been paid for saying that there is no

indication of civil unrest in their areas?

The answer to Question (1) would appear to be readily available.

The uses to the other questions, especiallie Estion (2), might be

If you deem it appropriate, I would be pleased to have you obtain

Re:

December 15, 1972

Hel Form

One of the memoranda on this subject which was

included in the package which Mr. Deegan sent me at your

request was a memorandum of 12/5/72 from me to Mr. Kinley

upon which Mr. Gray had written - "Prepare a memo for my

signature requesting the info. GIII 12-11 9:09A." The

information to which Mr. Gray was referring would be the

answers to three questions set forth in the body of the

memorandum.

In view of the fact that you are already in possession

of the memorandum containing the three questions and Mr.

Gray's instructions with reference thereto, I have suggested

to Mir. Kinley that the preparation of a memorandum for

Mr. Gray's signature would now be, under the circumstances

at this case, unnecessary. Mr. Kinley suggested that the

answers to those three questions coula be compiled and made

available to Mr. Gray in conjunction with the overall project of

developing an Urban Informant Program which he also requested™*

in his notation of 12-11-72 at 9:1T AM.

Therefore, I will not prepare a memorandum formally

requesting the answers to the three questions, and will assume

that the information will be furnished in connection with the project

we are now working on. Please advise if this suggested approach

presents any problems.

PURPOSE:

To obtain approval to send a letter to all con-

informant coverage.

• BACKGROUND:

Following the murder of Martin Luther King, JI.,

Bureau Agents conducted numerous interviews in ghetto

areas of U. S. cities as a result of racial disorders.

Productive contacts made with individuals dring these inter-

views are avaluable source of untapped informant potential.

By, following up these interviews by recontacting cooperative

residents of the ghetto areas, the Bureau can obtain a

higher quality and larger number of ghetto informants.

Receiving offices are instructed to exploit this situation

by developing, through contacts made during riots, additional

probationary racial informants (ghetto).

It is imperative that the Bureau utilize every

available investigative technique to obtain advance

In the wake of the racial upheavals following the

In keeping the Bureau and interested agencies

fully advised of the rapidly developing events in these

cities, Bureau Agents interviewed a great number of

individuals who were in positions to report on the under-

currents prevalent in the ghetto areas of these cities.

Undoubtedly these interviews opened up a whole

The new revised Extremist Informant Program

eliminates urban (ghetto) informants. and is limited to

Definitions and qualifications for these new

Potential Extremist Informant:

A PEI is an individual who is in a position to

furnish information concerning extremist activities of

individuals and organizations as well as information of an

extremist nature in those geographical areas where there is

a potential for violence.

The personal authority of the SAC is necessary to

designate and operate an individual as a PEI with exceptions

as noted below. These informants are to be operated for a

period of not more than one year and not less than six months

providing their potential is such that it appears he will qualify

for elevation to EI. The PEI must be discontinued immediately

following a determiration that he has no future potential as an

EI and those PEIs not elevated at the end of one year must be

discontinued.

Memorandum to Mr. W. M. Felt

Re:

Extremist Informant Program

The following are exceptions to the SAC's authority

for granting the approval of the operation of a PEI. If any

of the following conditions exist, the SAC must submit his

recommendation to FBIHQ on a UACB

basis:

1. Any individual in a sensitive position (i.e. news

media, educational field or any other field where disclosure

as an informant would cause concern to the Bureau).

2. Any individual being placed in an extremist

organization or any individual presently in an extremist

organization.

3.

Any individual who has been charged with a

felony violation in the past five years.

4. Any individual who is presently under indictment

or is on probation or parole, Federal or local.

5. Any individual with an unsavory background yet

who is in a position to furnish uniquely valuable information

not available from other sources.

The Special Agent in Charge has authority to

authorize payments to PEIs in the amount of up to $400.

Additional payment authority must be obtained from FBIHQ.

Bureau authority is necessary to elevate a PEI to

an al. Field recommendation must contain full justification.

II PEI does not qualify for EI within one year, he must be

discontinued.

Extremist Informant:

An El is an individual who has been operated as a

PEI for at least six months (in order that his reliability can

be properly evaluated) and is furnishing extremist information

on a regular basis whether it be concerning an extremist

organization or an unaffiliated extremist. In order to elevate

a PEI to an

EI, he must have produced authentic data on

extremist activities and be in a position to continue furnishing

extremist intelligence information.

Confidential Sources-Extremist:

A CS-E is an individual who is willing to cooperate

with the Bureau by furnishing extremist information brought

to his attention by virtue of his position in the community,

by his employment, or in view of his background in extremist

activities. This individual, whose identity must be protected,

will not be actively seeking information on behalf of the

Bureau.

OBSERVATIONS:

We contemplate no changes in the existing extremist

requirements as they pertain to background investigation,

payments, or other administrative policy.

Our present urban informants will be evaluated to

determine if they should be considered in the future as EIs,

PEIs, CS-E, directed to the Security or Criminal Informant

Programs, or discontinued altogether.

No individual will be operated as an EI or PEI solely

because he is in a "listening post" position. To insure we

have informant coverage in those areas where there is a potential

for violence, instructions will be issued to each SAC to insure

all Special Agent personnel are aware of the need for developing

information where there is a potential for violence and that

those Special Agents not directly involved with extremist

matters refer those individuals who may possess information of

potential violence to the Extremist Supervisor in order that

their informant potential may be assessed.

Re: Extremist Informant Program

The field will be instructed that CS-Es are not

to be kept in a pending status unless these sources are

furnishing information on a regular basis. Sources reporting

infrequently may be operated from a pending file with a

provision for closing after a fixed period of inactivity,

out of a dead file or out of a control file. Each SAC should

determine which method of operation is best suited for his

individual needs. SACs may desire to establish an informant

map which will clearly depict coverage in any geographical area

within their division.

Those informants currently carried as probationary

extremist informants should either be designated as PEIs

or elevated to EIs.

Program are approved, appropriate Manual changes will be made.

ADDENDUM

4/6/73

Mr. Gray in his instructions of 12/11/12, which led to the

aforementioned meeting of 2/20/73, said he was not persuaded that the

"listening post" concept continued to have merit. "It is," he said, "a

luxury that we cannot afford at the present." In view of the fact that the

"listening post" concept has up to now been a central feature of the Urban

(Ghetto) Informant Program, Mr. Gray's comments clearly contemplate

a major change in this program.

In order to insure effective implementation of the new policy,

it is therefore important that SAC's clearly understand that a major change

is intended. Unless the new policy is spelled out in unmistakably clear

terms, SAC's may understandably interpret the new policy as not repre-

senting a major change from the past.

The motivation for this kind of

interpretation is great because such an interpretation would be most

consistent with the maintenance of a high case load of urban (ghetto)

informants, and SAC's continue, I fear, to operate on the assumption

(erroneous I hope) that any significant decrease in their case loads,

regardless of the circumstances leading to the decrease, will automatically

mean a reduction in the number of Agents assigned to their Divisions, etc.

It is with the above in mind that I venture the following comments

on the proposed description of the revised Extremist Informant Program.

1. The revised policy statement should include language that

the revised Extremist Informant Program is designed to reduce substantially

the number of non-productive informants in the Urban (Ghetto) Informant

Program who have not provided positive specific intelligence concerning

extremist, security or criminal activities. The SAC's should be told that

careful and close attention must be given to insure that each informant

operating in the revised Extremist Informant Program is both in a position

to furnish and willing to furnish information of positive value to the Bureau

in the extremist area.

2. I would define a PEI simply as an individual who is in a position

to furnish information concerning extremist activities of individuals and/or

organizations. If we are covering both known individuals and organizations

with a potential for violence, "geographical areas where there is a potential

for violence" should automatically be covered. An additional reference to

"geographical areas...." is therefore unnecessary and could be confusing

Page 865

## Page 866

ADDENDUM (Continued...)

to SAC's since they are told elsewhere that mere "listening posts" are no

longer to be operated.

3. If a PEI is defined as suggested in #2, it is not clear who else

would be left in the great majority of situations for an SAC to approve as a

PEI except an individual who is being placed in an extremist organization or

an individual who is presently in an extremist organization. Therefore,

requiring an SAC to submit a recommendation to FBI HQ before an individual

is approved as a PEI when the individual in question is being placed in an

extremist organization or is presently in an extremist organization, which

submission is required by condition #2 on page 2 of this memorandum, could

be tantamount to requiring notification to Headquarters in practically every

case. This should not be necessary because the SAC seems to be in the best

position in the great majority of cases to make a final decision as to whether

a person should be operated as a PEI.

4. With further reference to those situations on page 2 of this

memorandum describing when the SAC must submit his recommendation of

a PEl to FBI HQ, there would appear to be very few candidates for a PEI

who have not been at least charged with felony violations. Therefore, the

fact that an individual has been charged with a felony violation in the past

five years seems of no great significance to the question whether that person

should be operated as a PEI, and the SAC should not be required to notify

FBI HQ when this situation arises. Thus, I would delete condition #3. With

specific reference to condition #5, as presently worded, this condition seems

too broad and/or ambiguous.. Practically speaking, couldn't anyone likely

to qualify as a PEl quite conceivably be described as a person with "an

unsavory background?" If so, this condition could have the effect of requiring

advance notification to FBI HQ in practically every situation, a result which,

as indicated above, I do not favor.

Finally, if fBi HQ is to be notified, as is

proposed by condition #1, when the individual is in a sensitive position, I

think the SAC should be given more specific guidance as to what is considered

to be a sensitive position. The phrase "any other field where disclosure as an

informant would cause concern to the Bureau" is too vague.

Armstrong Ill dated April 6, 1973, attached to Mr. G.

to Mr. E. S. Miller memorandum dated March 6, 1973, captione

"Extremist Informant Program."

Set forth below are comments concerning Mr. Armstrong's

observations:

1. Mr. Armstrong suggests the revised policy

should include language that the, revised Extremist Informant

Program is devised to reduce substantially the number of

"nonproductive informants in the Urban (Ghetto) Informant

Program.

We believe this is clearly stated in our memorandym

to all SAls on page four, paragraph one "Under the revised.

program no individual is

to be operated as an EI or PEI

solely because he is in a 'listening post' position."

2. Mr. Armstrong proposed that he would define

a potential

• extremist informant (PEI) simply as an individual

who is in a position to furnish information concerning

extremist activities of individuals and/or organizations.

hereiore, since we are covering both known individuals ano

organizations with a potential for violence, there is no neec

Ior a reference to "geographical areas where there is a poten-

tial for violence."

The key to the weakness in Mr. Armstrong's

definition is the

statement "covering both known individuals

and organizations with a potential for violence." There are

many areas in the United States where known organizations and

known extremists do not operate. Nevertheless, there is a

potential for violence in these areas because of socio-economic

conditions that breed frustrations thereby making the individuals

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re:

Extrenist Informant Program

The observation that SACs have a better insight

in the great majority of cases to make a final decision as to

whether a person should be operated as a Pal in connection

with the placing of an individual in an extremist organization

is not accurate in each and every case.

It is pointed out

that extremist activity is nationwide and individual FBI field

office files do not necessarily contain full information and

background concerning these organizations and the individuals

involved in these activities.

Experience has shown that

readquarters, after considering the sac's recommendation.

is in a better position to determine an individual's suit-

ability for operation as a PEI.

One of our greatest continuing

concerns is penetration of our informant ranks by extremist

"plants" as well as Agent provocateurs.

Headquarters' review

percent Pulprool, is an additional necessary check.

although not necessarily one hundred

This

in no way mitigates the SAC's responsibility as his approval

and recommendation is necessary in the first instance.

4. With regard to the comment there would appear

to be very few candidates for PEI who have not been at least

charged with felony violations, it is stated that althoug

a great number of our informants have been charged witr

VIolations, a felony charge in itself is not as frequent

as Mr. Armstrong believes.

A sampling of forty recently

approved PEIs shows that only seven of this forty had been

charged with a felony.

5.

As to the observation concerning informants

naving an unsavory background, it is noted our present

regulations as set out in Section 130, Volume IV, Manual Of

Instructions require that individuals with unsavory back-

grounds who would not ordinarily be considered as PEIs

because of the possibility they would not make suitable

witnesses because of unfavorable characteristics such as

extensive arrest records, excessive indebtedness, emotional

Illiteracy, and personal physical

approval.

Our operation of informants has a twofold purpose

(1) to obtain intelligence and (2) evidence necessary for

successful prosecution of violations of local and Federal

statutes.

We strongly believe we must continue this

requirement to insure our objectives are attained in all

cases.

In order to elevate

a PEI to an EI, he must have produced authentic data on

extremist activities and be in a position to continue furnishing

extremist intelligence information.

Confidential Source-Extremist:

A CS-E is an individual who is willing to cooperate

with the Bureau by furnishing extremist information brought

to his attention by virtue of his position in the community,

by his employment, or in view of his background in extremist

activities. This

individual, whose identity must be protected,

will not be actively seeking information on behalf of the

Bureau.

Prior to operating anyone as a CS-E, advise FBIHQ of

to furnish on a UACB basis.

OBSERVATIONS:

Our present urban informants will be evaluated to

determine if they should be considered in the future as EIs,

PEIs, CS-Es, directed to the Security or Criminal Informant

Programs, or discontinued altogether.

No individual will be operated as an EI or PEI solely

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE

(A) EXTREMIST INFORMANT PROGRAM -- Effective immediately

changes in the Extremist Informant Program as set out below are to

be implemented.

The revised Extremist Informant Program eliminates

the urban (ghetto) informant category and will now be limited to the

following three categories:

(a) potential extremist informant (PEI)

(b) extremist informant (EI)

(c) confidential source-extremist (CS-E)

Potential Extremist Informant:

A PEl is an individual who is in a position to furnish in-

formation concerning extremist activities of individuals and organizations.

A PEI should also be utilized to furnish information of an extremist

~ nature in those geographical areas where there is a potential for violence.

The personal authority of the SAC is necessary to designate

and operate an individual as a PEI with exceptions as noted below. These

informants are to be operated for a period of not more than one year and

not less than six months providing their potential is such that it appears

they will qualify for elevation to EI. The PEI must be discontinued im-

mediately following a determination that he has no future potential as

an EI.

The following are exceptions to the SAC's authority for

granting the approval of the operation of a PEI. If any of the following

conditions exist, the SAC must obtain authority from FBIHQ prior to

operating any individual as a PEI:

1. Any individual in a sensitive position (i.e. news media,

educational field or any other field where disclosure as an informant

could cause concern to the Bureau).

from FBI Headquarters.

Bureau authority is necessary to elevate a PEI to an EI.

The field recommendation must contain full justification. I PEI does

not qualify as an El within one year, he is to be discontinued.

Extremist Informant:

An El is an individual who has been operated as a PEI for

at least six months (in order that his reliability can be properly evaluated)

and is furnishing extremist intormation on a regular basis whether it be

concerning an extremist organization or an unattiliated extremist. In

order to elevate a PEI to an EI, he must have produced authentic data

on extremist activities and be in a position to continue furnishing

extremist intelligence information.

Confidential Source-Extremist:

A CS-E is an individual who is willing to cooperate with the

Bureau by furnishing extremist information coming to his attention by

virtue of his position in the community, by his employment, or in view

of his background. This individual, whose identity must be protected,

will not be actively seeking information on behalf of the Bureau. Prior

communication.

Under the revised program no individual is to be operated

as an El or a PEI solely because he is in a "listening post" position.

It is your responsibility to insure that there is informant coverage in

those geographical areas where there is a potential for violence. Alert

all Special Agent personnel to the need for developing information where

there is a potential for violence. Instruct those Special Agents not

directly involved with extremist matters to refer those individuals who

may possess information of potential violence to the Extremist

Supervisor in order that the informant potential of these individuals may

be assessed.

Those informants currently carried as probationary

extremist informants should either be designated as PEIs or elevated

as Els.

Appropriate Manual changes follow.

"Dean comrades:

"The march on Washington, August 28th, called by

rights, is an event of the greatest historic importance.

It deserves the support of everyone who recognizes

that this struggle isessential to guaranteeing constitutional

rights for all and for the further denocratic advance of our

country.

"For this reason, we, as all other labor and

progressive groups, will lend our full support to this event.

"We urge you follow closely these developments

and that you follow the worker and Midweek Worlter on the

progress of the campaign, as well as suggestions for its

further development."

INTEREST OF CPUSA IN MARCIL ON WASHINGTON

A. National Leadership, CPUSA

At a meeting of leading CP functionaries

JACKSON reported on

importance of getting legislation abolishing segregation in

all public places.

he called for a Federal policy of

non-aiscrimination, and the inclusion of on-the-job truining

{or Negroes in all areas of the United states.

JACKSON stated 100,000 to 200,000 white

people should join with the Negro people in a massive

demonstration in Nachington, D.le: in the event of a

filibuster to prevent the passage

of civil rights laws.

He added a cooperative relationship must be established among

the Negro organizations.

BENJAMIN J. DAVIS remarked everyone is calling the

Negro movement a revolution.

He said it is a transition

of the Negro in

this country Irom second class to first

class citizenship within the framework of our present social

system.

He continued,

"We are witnessing a revolutionary

movement in our country, but we are just not in it...

DAVIS sald the biggest single question is not the

aisagreement and disunity among Negro leaders, which is

that the white allies of

would like "to see the Party get on all fours in respect

to the struggle."

POTASH said the criticism

against the Party is

valid, and it is correct to say

"we" are not coming forward

not writing and not giving leadership.

The leadership or the

Party should explore all ways and means for all of "us"

to play a bigger role in this struggle "which we have not

done yet."

POTASH felt the trade union movement was not making

a real struggle because of their own discrimination, and

the comrades must find ways to "build a fire" under the

leadership of the trade. union movement.

ELIZABITH GURLEY FLYNN stated no matter how much

"we" do, It is not enough, but, on the other hand, "we"

should not underestimate the work the Party does.

TAMES E.

JAcKSON stated "the worlor" must be

utrized along with Party facilities to interest the trade

union movement in the Negro struggle, and "the Party must

register Its presence on the street,"

June 19, 1963

At a meeting of the Organization Bureau, CPUSA,

held July il, 1963, at CP Headquarters, New York City,

JACK STACHEL stated the purpose of the

meeting was to discuss

the August 28th march on Washington, D.C., which he said

had two objectives:

I. To arouse the conscience of America to the

economic plight of the Negro in the United States.

2. To demand that an effective and meaningful

civil rights bill be passed by congress, to protest

against filibuster and demand majority rule in the United

States Senate.

STACHEL described plans being made by organizations

then asked rhetorically,

"How can we explain to anybody in the future that

100,000 people went to Washington and we were not among them?!

STaCHEL proposed that, if need be, the Party

finance people to go to this demonstration.

He suggested

that contact be made with Jewish clubs and national groups

such as the Hungarians, Russians, Ukranians and Armenians

in order to get people for the demonstration.

He commented

"We must convey this approach to the other Districts.

There

are tremendous possibilities here for contacts with the

Negroes, in the

Jewish field, the youth. It can open up a

new life for us."

IRVING POTASH proposed that comrades go to

community organizations and set up groups in shops to

collect money.

He said the Party must concentrate on the

nomployment issue in Harlem, Newark and other areas

, "where

there are congregations of Negro population."

STACHEL proposed further meetings on this matter

to perfect plans, stating that he thinks it possible "for

our left forces alone, if they work properly, to organize

more than five thousand people to be there in Washington."

that it is an ideological struggle for the minds

the question always to be decided upon is on what do you

base yourself and the answer is to defend Negro rights.

STACHEL stated that Negroes make up a large

majority of the working class and "we" have to represent

them.

The second question is in regard to the labor movement

In relation to Negroes and whites and

"we" have to become the

vanguard in this.

thing "we" decided is that on

and "The Worker."

He said that WILLIAM WEINSTONE

and LOUIS WEINSTOCK will 'help plan this and make sure "we"

have Comrades...The general idea is that Comrades will sell

papers and there are available pamphlets on the Negro question.

The idea is to organize pressure groups..... which will come

from New Jersey, Philadelphia and Baltimore.....

The estimate

require a minimum of 100 people.

WILLIAM ALBERTSON said it must be realized that

before

this "civil rights revoiution" got underway, the Party

was isolated from the movement of the Negro people. He stated

that to

build the Party.

it must be

"that you are the

est picketers, the best cadre fighting, the best of

everything, otherwise you are just a propaganda organization

and you are not participating in the struggle."

ALBERTSON proposed the opening of a specia

headquarters in Washington, D.C. He stated "the people

that we organize can go there as part of a whole group, and

then they separate themselves there."

He suggested that

recruits for the demonstration be sought among

who do not have mass responsibilities"

WILLIAM WEINSTONE proposed that a quantity of

Ilterature be carefully selected to get into the hands of

the people and "thereby help to deepen the struggle."

ARNOLD JOHNSON said there should be a meeting

between the National Association for the Advancement of

colored People (NAACP), the

church groups and the various

other agencies that are participating so that some kind of

order can bemaintained. He

said that there should be a

full-fledged discussion on this and proposed that the NAACP

pe contacted in order to arrange a meeting.

He continued,

"secondly, I would like to say

this August 28th is not

the climax to this fight.

It is not the end to everything.

We should not go into this thing

everything we've

got only to find that we have nothing left to go with arter

JOHNSON urged that the Party try to become

associated "with these different groups that are participating,"

noting that in this way "we may receive a share of the

radio and press coverase that will go with this event "tie

said that besides contacting all these other agencies, it

He commented,.

'I think we can sell this for a nickel.

WILLIAM ALBERTSON expressed pleasure with the

activity going on in New York, and commented "we have in

this march a relationship between Negro and white that we have

never had before in history."

ALBERTSON said "we" have two objectives:

1. Participation by the total membership.

2. "We" take responsibility for initiating

organization on the "grass roots level" in connection with

the march....

He said there is one problem, the puerto Ricans are

going down and are setting up their own political action

IRVING POTASH commented that "our Comrades" in

Industry have been instructed to make the maximum contacts

possible in whatever Lactory they are in and

WILLIAM ALBERTSON, concluding the discussion,

said that there is to be from 50 to 75 assembly points in

Washington.

Each State will have an assembly point. The

smaller States will be merged. ALBERTSON then proposed that

chrough what the Negro has over the vears. coupled with

chis, is also the fact that the puerto Ricans do not desire

to be linked with the Negro population, and as a result

elements of racism are showing.

Continuing, THOMPSON remarked that the Puerto

Rican movement may develop under Its own leadership,

THOMAS NABRIED stated that in Phlladelphia

"we" have gone into certain areas with loudspealers to inform

the people as to what is going on.

"We" expect that about half of

these people in these areas will participate in the March

on washington:

and "we". are interested in setting up a

neeting upon their return from Washington.

He said they

would like to establish a base for the continuation of

their ideas in order to correlate what has happened.

NABRIED said that there is the usual amount of

jealousy among the various organizations working on the

March, but he believes they will be set aside "for this

historic event."

JAMES LUSTIG commented on the situation in New

Jersey, which he said was getting better.

LUSTIG, in commenting on the March, said that

the number represented will depena upon the amount of

transportation available.

for the Advancement of Colorea People (NAACP, has

sponsored a train from Newark to washington, D.C., and that

buses will be sponsored by the Congress of Racial Equality

(CORE), and will leave for Washington from Lincoln Park in

Newark, New Jersey.

LUStIG, in concluding nis comments,

that the most important thing is that following the

March, the participating organizations will hold a conference

and what will be decided there will be as important as the

March itself.

MORTIMER DANIEL RUBIN said that the general picture

he has regarding the March is that there will be a large

number of young people attending.

He said that a young

person from Pittsburgh had written to him saying that

between two and three thousand people are expected

to go to Washington, D.C. by train and bus.

RUBIN said

the one big problem

that has arisen is "What is our special

role in all of this? We have people with a lot of

enthusiasm working with people unrelated with us."

as to widen partleipation and to work harder: to

said "we are loaded with literature but are unable

this situation applies not, only to New York but to all sections

of the country. WEINSTOCK recommended that ten thousand

copies of "The Worker: be distributed in various parts

of the country, since there is to be no distribution in

He also recommended that ten thousand

pamphlets be sold at concentration points on the morning

of August 28, 1903; the remainder to be sold after the

demonstration.

RENTAMTN •T. DAVIS

agreed that ten thousaa

copies of "The Worker"

should be distributed as a Party

enterprise.

He said that as a result there could be

a substantial increase in the paper's circulation, as

well as a build-up for the Party.

DAVIS commented that GEORGE MEANEY's statement

regarding

the Negro Movement indicates a white chauvinist

and a white supremacy attitude.

DAVIS felt that MEANEY,

because of his attitude, is turning the Negro Movement

over to the muslims and

other extremists.

He recommended

that the Party call upon workers and labor leaders to

repudiate MEANEY's statement.

At the same time "we" should

defend A. PHILIP RANDOLPH and WALTER REUTHER's attitude.

DAVIS was of the opinion that RANDOLPH would welcome a

sharp criticism of GEORGE MEANEY.

WILLIAM I. PATTERSON commented that MANEY's

action will have an effect.not only in relation to the

March but also to its aftermath.

He said it must be

shown that MEANEY's attitude does not reflect the attitude

of the Trade Union Movement as a whole.

PHIL BART stated that there has not been a

comparable period in the past wherein hundreds of

communists will actually be together with tens of thousands

of others In the March. He said efforts should be made to

work with the idea of establishing connections with new

forces.

that they have to point out that the problem of Negro

unemployed is not only a Harlem problem, it is also

a problem on the lower East Side, in Bedord Stuyvesant,

if this proposal is adopted, someone from the caucus

group scula be on the committee, or better still,

he the chairman nê the committoo.

4.

Propose that if the speakers committee 1s

established, a list of the various unions in New

their meeting dates in order that NALC speakers

could attend the various meetings to solicit support

for the march.

TORMEY said that this would serve to

obtain union sanctions for the march or to get their

representatives to take part in the march.

5. Propose that NAIC delegates be sent to the

enlist their support for the march. TORMEY felt

that the construction trades would probably support

V. VIEWS OF CPUSA ON RESULTS OF MARCH ON

WASHINGTON AND SUBSEQUENT ACTIVITY

A. National Leadership, CPUSA

GUS HALL stated; with respect to the March ón

Washington, that in his opinion

there were a quarter of a

million people in the March. He stated that one quarter of

people in the March were

white and that he and the Party

could take credit for there having

; been so many white neople

in the March. HALL further stated the Party "had a

deal to do with this and that the Party played a major role

in many of these white people going to Washington."

NY I-45

August 28, 1903

A meeting of leading CP functionaries was

held

August 30, 1963, at CP Headquarters, New York City.

The discussion concerned itself with the civil rights

legislation pending in Congress and what could be done to get

the Congress to react favorably towards this legislation now

that the March on Washington was a success.

JACK STACHEL urged that efforts should be made to

get the labor unions involved in this fight.

WILLIAM 1.

PATTERSON commented that demonstrations should be held in front

of press offices demanding editorials on the need to do away

with the filibusters

in Congress.

ARNOLD JOHNSON called for work stoppages as well as

demonstrations in Washington, D.C., as an anti-filibuster

step. He said the work stoppages could be for a few minutes

each day, to be increased daily as long as the filibusters

continue.

BENJAMIN J. DAVIS, Jr., stated that the CP should

think more along the lines of a

mass movement of a non-partisan

DAVIS said that he would propose that the CP have people

demonstrate in washington, D.C.,

every day of the

filibuster.'

He also felt that it was

move Ho co

shut down everything in this country as an anti-filibuster

no doug

possible to have ten million Negroes

move. He felt that the work stoppages could be for fifteen

minutes a day on the first day and the next day incres the

work stoppage to a period of two hours.

He felt that it was

a legitimate demand to mobilize the American people in order

to break any filibuster.

DAVIS averred to the recent article by DAVID LAWRENCE

in the "New York Herald Tribune."

He described LAURONCE'S

column as the worst one in ine

entire country. NaVlu suated

that in his opinion, he did not believe that it would be out of

line to set up a picket line around the "New York Herald Tribune."

He said the picket line would be along the lines that DAVID

LAWRENCE must go or there must be a public apology by that

paper.

DAVIS also felt that some effort should be made to force

Governor NELSON ROCKEFELLER of New York to take an active part

in breaking any filibuster.

NY T-45

August 30, 1963

A meeting of the National Board, CPUSA, and invited

guests was held September 4, 1963, in New York.

At this meeting, the main point on the agenda was

the March on Washington.

BENJAMIN J. DAVIS discussed the March. He characterized

It as "the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history

the country" and said there is a feeling in many quarters

that official estimates of the March were lower on attendance

figures than the number who actually participated. He stated

that although the newspapers said there were approximately 200,000,

it appeared more likely that there were close to 300,000 or

400,000.

NY 100-151548

DANIS called for the establishment of a policy

committee by the CPUSA for the purpose of bringing the

meaning of the March to the people and to act on local

problems.

He commented,

"More and more it is going to be

necessary to work on our

contribution within the framework

of the March... to fight fop the role of the working man...

more and more it becomes necessary to work for the ideolngy

of this particular movement and the working class...

According to DAVIS, the breaking of a filivuiter "is

the main next job"

and pressure must be put on the prosident

of the United

States to break the resistance.

JAMES JACKSON commended DAVIS on his report.

He

stated that ROY WILKINS, Executive Secretary of the Wational

Association for the Advancement of Colored People (vard?)

had paid tribute to Dr. DU BOIS and it was his opinion

that "there seemed to be kind of a second thought that the

Negro movement at this stage in its organizational security

can ill afford its divorcement of the experience and the

substantial contribution of Negro Marxists.

JACKSON

noted that every newspaper in every country in the world has

Identified DU BOIS,

not only as a leading literary figure, but

also as a Communist.

In describing the role of the CPUSA, JACKSON said that,

"although equipped with proper foresignt and projections, it

"We were one of many stimulating elements... but in this we

played a rather anonymous fole and we functioned more or less

as individuals.

Our mission was that runaistinguishable

parts of the whole. In many areas our people were responsible

for getting fine turnouts...the stimulating role our people

played in certain areas needed additional emphasís...as to just

what should be our particular role...it is a

fact that in

the huge mass role we performed anonymously."

NY 100-151548

JACKSON then asked

rhetorically "Was there no special

role for the Party?"

and continued that "it points out

serious aspect of the Party - akind of critical

aspect of

organizational laxity, a problem of definition of our identity."

JACKSON was critical of the fact that

participated in the distribution of "The worker,, so few

and other

Isterature noting that "in spite of the fact that the

literature was neatly packaged and all prepared, in spite of

the fact there were decisions and commitments, 3 or 4 people

participated in the distribution..

He said this was not

just another mass meeting but was

"a big chunk of the most

advanced area of the American popular masses and working class."

He noted that "this is an assembly that comes once in the life-

time of a party to assumbic the militant, dedicates people who

crossed half the country, gave up their jobs for a day or so,

sacrificed to get into a social

pawn in which Communists should exist... to be with these

people, eat with them, meet with them,

net with them, dev

This was a natural

develop address with

which they could further communicate."

JACKSON recalled the fact that, with only one

aissentang vote, it had been decided that there be a

special edition of "The Worker" for

the March and that "a

hundred comrades should participate" in Its distribution

but, in spite of this, the one dissent was the prevailing

reaction.

GUS HALI asked how many copies.

WEINSTOCK stated that 7

sold "that day" and a total of about 1,000 pamphlets were

also sold.

WEINSTOCK remarked that final arrangements were

made three or four weeks before the affair and "there were

nineteen people at the meeting where 100 were supposed to

come, five of them non-Communists..."

JACKSON stressed the need for getting better

organizational means to get people to work.

He said

that, while in Weshington, he had gotten "maybe a half

dozen invitations

from trade unions"

and that the trade

•unions put on a cremendous public relations job. He

noted that there was a Socialist Party conference for

civil rights held on Thursday and Friday following the March

attended by 100 people at the first session and about 300

people at the second session.

WILLIAM PATTERSON remarked "I think there is the

opportunity for us to strengthen our participation in the

follow-up (of the August 28th March) in the major districts

and states that have not only struggled for public works

programs but also other unemployment programs

MORTIMER DANIEL RUBIN stated he thought there was

an improvement in youth work in terms of participation through

mass organizations and there has been an improvement in terms

of involvement of youth in civil rights demonstrations.

IRVING POTASH commented "the country will not be

the same after this March. I think an examination will

probably show that many of our comrades played a very

important role in bringing about or helping to bring about

the participation of quite a number of trade unionists and

trade union officials in this."

POTASH stated the CPUSA must play a very important

role in the civil rights struggle and "the youth movement ir

estab a baste relations vote the per so farst of all to

POTASH continued, "It is not difficult to establish

unose unions where the Communists have a great deal of

influence.

Those were the unions which produced the greatest

participation in this March.

To some extent this is true of

the UAW. Although that is not a red led union, it is true

It has

a great deal of left influence...you take District 65

(District 65 Retail Wholesale

and Department Store Union,

AFI-CIO) with a participation

of four and one half thousand,

certainly there is an example of left influence, Conmunist

influence, where

these unions have led the upsurge in che

Negro struggle."

POTASH, with respect to the role of the CPUSA,

stated he thought that up to now the Party has been too

cautious and it should be put on

the agenda to move into this

area with a greater decisiveness.

September 4, 1963

At a meeting of leading CP functionaries

neld September 6, 1903, in New York, JAMES E. JACKSON

reported on the August

28th, 1963 March on Washington,

claiming that "not since the Civil war have so many

official bodies of the working population of our country

there was a unity of purpose between the leadership and those

who participated in the March.

JACKSON mentioned his attendance at a conference

called by the socialist party and held in Washington, was

during the week of the March.

He said the conference

very significant because it attracted to it as participants

and key

administrators of the March.

JACKSON commented, "One of

JACKSON was critical of the role of "The

Worker" In connection with the

March, stating "our paper

In comparison with any paper did not

follow this event

as it should have done.

The truth is that very little

happened to utilize 'The Worker' to establish our banner

above the other banners in this movement."

JACKSON pointed out that, in spite of the

decision to publish a

He described

of adequate distribution of

"The Worker" as a serious

weakness in organization and said "Our Party is the

vehicle to socialism.

The 200,000 people who took part

In the March should be the 200, 000 people no snoula be

In our Party. So we had the additional duty in this March

to win Party members."

GEORGE MORRIS said that the union representation

at the August 28th March was brought there by unions that

are partially or to some

extent Socialist-Party influenced

or have a Left background.

He described this as a

revitalization of the united front and stated "I think this

Is something for us to seriously think about because it

again emphasizes that there is a base for progressive

activity. "

A meeting of leading CP functionaries was held

September 16, 1963, in New York.

JAMES JACKSON reviewed the racial situation in

Birmingham, Alabama, and announced that "The Worker" would

carry a lead editorial on the first page demanding that

Governor WALLACE of Alabama be brought to justice; demanding

that the President establish federal occupational

authority

throughout Alabama; demanding a roundup of the membership of

the American Nationalist Party, the White Citizens Councils,

and the Ku Klux Klan; and demanding the immediate discharge

J. EDGAR HOOVER, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

(FBI), and a complete reorganization of the FBI.

& WILLIAM PATTERSON said that, immediately after hearing

of the bombing in Birmingham, he reached a number of people ir

the Harlem area of New York City, and raised the question of

sending telegrams and holding some kind of demonstration.

PATTERSON said that, while he thought JACKSON's

he would like to see

a special article devoted to the FBI and

statement concerning the FBI was correct, its complete fallure

over the years" in relation to racial matters in the United

States.

ROBERT THOMPSON stated the CPUSA should try to bring

about effective, immediate action by the New York City Committee

on Racial Equality. He said there should be some kind of major

action in New York City, either In the nature of a mass meeting

or a march and the Party should undertake a campaign in New York

and nationally to influence public opinion in this situation.

IRVING POTASH said it Is not enough to throw

responsibility on Governor WALLACE of Alabama, but it must

be stated in clear terms that the federal government also

has a certain responsibility for what is happening in Alabama.

POTASH noted that President KENNEDY is scheduled

to appear before the United Nations (UN) and suggested it might

be advisable to set up delegations to submit petitions and

demands

"even before he gets to the UN", thereby precipitating

a possible demonstration at the UN.

POTASH also suggested the possibility of taking the

proposed statement for "The Worker"

and reading it publicly

at some federal office, "possibly at Foley

"to dramatize our feelings in this matter. „Square" in order

BEN DAVIS commented, "I feel bitterly disappointed

and bitterly dissatisfied with the response of our Party."

He

said the Negro movement has now reached the stage which requires

a sharpening up of "our attack on the Kennedy administration."

DAVIS urged greater activity on the part of the CPUSA stating,

"I am of the opinion that unless our Party finds a way,

symbolically or personally, or in some other way, to integrate

Itselt n some public manner, if not in its own name, then

through some organization in which the Party is known to have

influence, we are just going

.. "Brutal murder of 6 Negro children yesterday in

Birmingham demands immediate action and Federal troops to

protect lives of American citizens against lawless insurrection,

terror,

and calls for the arrest of Wallace and others

responsible for murder and'bombings. Federal authorities

Nothing short of these minimum measures will

occupying various positions along

CrUSA, and discuss what he felt to be the main threat to the

democratic idea.

BEN DAVIS spoke of the letter from Tuskegee

Institute describing it as of greatest importance.

He

asserted that the Negroes are now willing, as are other

forces, to know what the Communist Party nas to say ana

to listen to Communists and welcome whatever support, guidance,

leadership, and practical sacrifice the Communists can give

"In this new stage, which in how to breal the resistance of

the Dixiecrats and how to stop the McCarran Act." DAVIS stated

that the letter from Tuskegee indicates how the

A meeting of the National Board, CPUSA and invited

guests was held September 25, 1963, in New York.

The meeting concerned itself primarily with a report

being prepared by BENJAMIN J. DAVIS, Jr. on the Negro struggle

In the United States.

BENJAMIN J. DAVIS, Jr. discussed an outline form for

the report he is preparing.

said

that he did not intend

-65-

NY 100-151548

that his report be considered an ideological report, noting

there is "no Chinesè wall"

between questions of ideology ano

a political line. He said it is possible to divide

the two.

The point, of the report is to concentrate on the next step

in the Negro movement as a whole.

DAVIS felt that the Party

had defined the character of the

Negro Revolution and

"our

position" is essentially that the

in form despite the fact that

"we"vegro movement is national

had come up with

the

erroneous position of "self-determination."

DAVIS said that the Negro people have adopted a

method of struggle, namely "peaceful, non-violent, direct

mass action.

He said this is now the chosen method of

struggle by the Negro masses.

He said the new question coming

Up, as a result of

the bombings in Birmingham, is whether now

the time to abandon the whole question of non-violent

He saiû it mus his opinion that thoy should not

abandon this theory because the purpose of the violence in

Birmingham is to provoke the Negro and to date, the Negro

has shown more self-restraint in the face of it.

Continuing, DAVIS said "we" must make it clear

that "we are for these self-defense programs of the Negroes."

He said the Negro should have the right to defend himself

against brutal attacks by racists

with whatever weapons they

can. He said the Party shoula point out that the Federal

Government should step in and protect the Negro so that this

responsibility is not left on the Negro people.

DAVIS said

the Negro people are in favor of Federal action in Birmingham

and want Federal troops to take over the state. He felt that

an additional goal is to break the resistance of the Dixiecrats

which means "illegaiizing and outlawing"

all fascist organizations.

operating in the south.

DAVIS commented that the two-man truce team sent by

the KENNEDY Administration to Birmingnam (KENNETH C. ROYALL and

EARL C. BLAIK) was a pitiful step by the administration.

He

said that KING (MARTIN LUTHER KING,

President of the southern

Christian Leadership Conference) made a serious mistake when

he agreed to accept these two people.

DAVIS said that in

criticizing this method "we" should put the blame on the

KENNEDY Administration and not on KING.

Continuing, DAVIS stated that the great unity achieved

as a result of the August 20, March on Washington can only be

maintained by the development of further mass motions of this

adding "you cannot have unity of the Negro people

He said the domestic leadership of

the Negro movement, in one form or another, is tied in some

"way to the KENNEDY Administration.

This is a situation

that requires greater independence on the part of the Negro

movement and its leaders.

The key question is "how to get

our line out and how to fight for it and how the party is

to exert some control and some influence."

DAVIS stated that the August 28, March on Washington

was not only a historical and unprecedented demonstration of

the unity of the Negro people as well as the white people, but

that the March transferred ihe responsibility to the Federal

Government and to the American citizen.

He said the next

step, following Birmingham and the bombings, has to be a step

involving masses of people. Since everyone

"at the demonstration"

took a pledge to sit in, to stand in, to demonstrate, now 1s the

time, in my opinion, for the leaders of the Negro movement to

use this to advantage. DAVIS stated that the south in the sext

five years will be the additional force which can be brought

into the progressive movement and

will help change the whole

relationship of forces.

He said "somehow our party has to appear

as the champion of the Negro people's movement and as the

champion of

masses in the south."

He said this is

"We" have to keep

• In mind the image of

'our Party" among the Negro people as well

as the white workers and progressives throughout the country.

Following DAVIS' comments a discussion period

followed.

ROBERT THOMPSON said that the main object of

the report is to develop the question "What is required now

to successfully force federal intervention in Alabama?"

He said that "we" have to defend KING's leadership in this

movement.. especially the leadership that KING represents.

THOMPSON remarked that he did not agree that there was

a need for a new center for the civil rights movement

as suggested by DAVIS. He said it would not serve a

useful purpose and such a center would be a focal point

for the gathering of "every flighty element that is trying

THOMPSON said "we" have to think about the

development of the strength and role of the Negro-American

Labor Council (NALC). He said their activities can play

a real part and can be expanded to shape the program of

the civil rights movement.

GUS HALL expressed the opinion that there is a

need now to discuss the question of a new party, a party

of labor and Negro. There is a need to discuss a new

emerge as a giant political action.

He felt that there was

also a need

to project new ideas on the part of labor

• "in

order to get out of their rut."

JAMES JACKSON said the report should give a rousing

salute to the Negro in

this year 1963.

Is the glorious rise of the Negro in America which has

inspired the world.

JACKSON, in commenting on the pending

civil rights bill, felt. that

fact that the

their responsibilities. He said that if the Federal

nothing which will either turn this movement into an anti-

GREEN said "our objective" must be to press the

administration to break with the Dixiecrats and this will

guarantee the renovation of the south.

been raised to a new level by the March.

The struggle for

equality is a struggle for all Americans not, for Negroes

alone.

The March was excellent but the murder of Negroes

in Alabama and the fact that police brutality 1s still a

major issue against Negroes should have been brought out more

in the March.

The leaders of the March should concentrate on

these proposals in regard to civil rights and a strong

Fair Employment Practices Commission.

They should see that

the Negro is protected in his right to vote in the south

and a tight made for full equality in the struggle for jobs.

The Negro fight or jobs is a test for the labor movement

and Negro and white allies.

This fight should be concentrated

Industry by industry and understanding in trade unions raisea

to a new level.

Although the Narch was good, there was not enough

organization in the grass root section of the morement,

especially in the puerto Rican cormunity. Jew Puerto Ricans

took part because they were not organized and were not told what

the March was all about.

The Puerto Rivan lovement should be

built up and this is one fleld the Parly could move into and

do a good job.

The Negro American Labor Courcil was not as successful

as It should have been in the March. Ihis organization has

been going downhill since its last convention in its fight for

Negro rights. However, individual leaders, especially A.

PHILIP RANDOLPH, showed great strength and

character.

The formation of the new Negro party is a danger

to the Negro movement at the present time.

It is a danger

to the Negro movement because its name will split the movement

itself.

JAMES TORMEY gave a report on the Negro Movement

and the August 28, 1963 March on Washington,

at a meeting of the CP caucus in the New York Chapter of

the Negro American Labor Council (NALC).

TORMEY advised tho following in hio rsport:

The Negro Movement is a revolutionary movement

aimed at the elimination of the residue of slavery anc

Reverend MARTIN LUTHEF

against the power structure of the United states,

and

.that this is most important because it is a Marxist approach

to the problem coming from a Negro leader.

Concerning the August 28, 1963, March on Washington,

the Negro leadership estimated 250,000 people participated

With an estimate of approximately thirty per cent white people.

This is very important to the overall success of the March.

The Muslim and Black Nationalist Movement suffered

a serious setback because of the March on Washington, the way

It was received and the way that it was carried out without

any riots or fighting.

The efforts of the progressives to obtain the labor

unions participation in the Civil Rights and Negro Movement

cantamount to saving labor unions. If the Labor Movement

does not become involved in this struggle they could be

seriously weakened. Labor seriously needs the alliance

with the Negro Movement.

reason given was that as originally planned it would have beer

At a CP meeting held September 4, 1963, in Newark,

New Jersey, a discussion was held relative to the March on

Washington.

It was stated by one of the members present that

he felt the March would not accomplish any great change in

congress, and it would not bring civil rights closer, but it

was

a success in that the March was actually held.

that President KENNEDY, by being so nice, had robbed the

March of its militancy. President KENNEDY, by endorsing the

March, attracted many people to the March

who otherwise would not

have attended.

It was further felt that a bad part of the March

was the failure of those participating not to realize that

the United States must have socialism to bring about civil

rights and end unemployment.

INDEPENDENT SOCIALIST LEAGUE (ISL), formerly

known as the Workers Party (WP)

The May 4, 1942, issue of "Labor Action"

cial publication of

Party (SWP).

The article stated that when the Hitler-Stalin Pact

was signed

and Poland invaded, the minority group within the SWP,

in proclaiming the formation of the WP, condemned the pact as

being imperialistic in nature and stated it would not support

either imperialist camp.

The April 25, 1949, issue of "Labor Action" contained

an account of the Fifth National Convention of the WP, held March

24-27, 1949, in New

York City, which reflected the change of name

of the organizaiion from the we to the independent socialist.

League (ISL) in order to emphasize the character of the group as

a propaganda group for the spreading of socialist ideas and not •

as a full-fledged political party.

The July 14, 1958, issue of "Labor Action", an official

publication of the ISL, contained an article captioned "The ISI

Program in Brief". The article indicated:

"The ISL stands for

socialist democracy and against the two systems of exploitation

which now divide the world:

as a Marxist movement, looks to the working class and

present struggle as the basic progressive force in society.

oreme the looks

capitalism and Stalinism.

The ISI,

its ever-

ISh is organized to spread the ideas of socialism in the labor

movement and among all other sections of the people. There can

be no lasting and genuine democracy without socialism and there

can be no socialism without democracy."

The September 22, 1958, issue of "Labor Action" con-

began in 1945 when several militant members of the young

People's Socialist League (YPSL), the youth organization

of the socialist Party,

accepted

a proposal that they become

affiliated with the Workers Party.

The first issue of the group's

newspaper, "Youth Action for Socialism," in October, 1945,

contained an article which indicated that "...Only socialism can

answer youth's needs for jobs, peace, education and a fuller

youth so i eates the only national revolutionary

Challenge," published as page three of "Labor Action," an

League (YSL) which pointed out that ataunity conference occurriny

YOUNG SOCIALIST LEAGUE (YSL)

The March 1, 1954, issue of the "Young Socialist

Challenge," published

as page three of "Labor Action," an

official publication of the Independent Socialist League (ISL),

contained an article concerning the creation of the YSI,

which pointed out that at a unity conference occuring February

12-14, 1954, at Labor Action Hall, New Yorks, New York, a merger

occurred between the Young People's Socialist League (XESL)

and

the Socialist Youth League (SYL). The new organization was

named the YSL.

On June 15, 1954, a source made available the minutes

of the YSL'S National Action Committee meeting of April 13, 1954,

which reflected that one S. Siteman, "Chairman of SP (Socialist

Party) Youth Committee," had objected to a statement appearing

in "Commerce," a New York University journal, which indicated

that the YPSL merged with the syL to torm the YSL. He explained

that the YPSL did not merge with anyone, that it continued to

exist as the youth section of the Socialist Party. He explained

that a small group of the YPSL was dropped, expelled, or

suspended from that organization and joined the syl, which he

characterized as the youth group of the "Trotskyite

ISL". He

explained that after these few former members of

the YPSL joined

, the SYL, the SYL then proceeded to change its name for its own

purposes.

On April 9, 1956, a second source advised that the YSL

has frequently worked in close sympathetic cooperation with the

ISt toward similar objectives, although each major issue given

mutual consideration is decided upon by these organizations

individually. The YSL serves as an apprenticeship for the

Ish, but ISh selection of members from Ist ranks is made on

an individual and personal basis.

In may instances YSL members

are also members of the ISL. The YSL and the ISL utilize the

same printing house

in New York City and the YSI publication is

printed as an insert in "Labor Action." Frequently, lecturers

before the YSL are ISL members.

WORKERS WORLD PARTY

on April 11, 1959, a confidential source advised

that on February 12, 1959, a Socialist Workers Party (SWP)

minority group, under the leadership of National

committee member, SAM BALLAN, split from the SwP.

The source stated that this minority group,

referred to as the Marcyites, after many years of program and

policy differences on varied issues concerning tactics and inter-

pretation of political events, split from the SWP on the

grounds that the Party was liquidating itself by

departing from the Marxist precepts of LEON TROISKY and

retreating from the fight for the world socialist revolution.

The final issue which ultimately forced the split was the

minority's opposition to the SwP regroupment policy which

involved cooperation with the Communist Party (CP)

periphery - individuals characterized by the minority as

petty - bourgenis.

The minority program, according to ine source,

advocates unconditional defense of the Soviet Union and

has as its goal the building of a revolutionary party

wish a complete proletarian orientation

for the purpose of overthrowing capitalism in

the United States and throughout the world.

On May 12, 1960, the source advised that this

minority group had chosen the name workers World Party.

On May 6, 1963, a second confidential source

stated that the headquarters of the workers World Party

were located at 45 West 2lst Street, New York, New York.

The SWP and the CP have been designated by the

Attorney General of the United States pursuant to

Executive Order 10450.

MARCH ON WASHINGTON,

AUGUST 28, 1963

RACIAL MATTERS

Віди

Although statements of the leaders of organization

involved in the march on Washington set for August 28, 1963,

10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., plus facts reported by our sources tov

date indicate a "peaceful demonstration" and that violence maylistm

be averted, nevertheless, we are bending every effort to

secure in advance detailed information as to the make-up,

size,

and the mode of transportation of local groups which will

attend, are keeping the Department and interested agencies

advised

of all pertinent developments, have arranged for visual and

photographic coverage by Washington Field Office, and have

demonstrations occur in the Federal triangle area.

Apparent through the lack of coordination existing

between the National Association for, the Advancement of Colored

People (NAACP) and the Congress of' Racial Equality (CORE), the

oftentimes divergent vertebrae providing principal support to

racial demonstrations, is the possibility that since organizations

sponsoring the march on Washington many times have not presented

a unified front on a local basis, it will be even more difficult.

for the march leaders to establish'a cohesive operation on a

nation-wide basis.

For example, information received 7/24/63 from

our Little Rock sources specifically pointed up such a situation

when the CORE representative issued statements concerning an

"ultimatum" which was going to be forthcoming if racial conditions

were not improved while NAACP leaders in the area separated

themselves from this position with "no comnent" answers to press

inquiries.

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont

RIE: MARCH ON WASHINGTON

Our source at a principal focal point of racial

activity, Albany, Georgia, indicated exhortations were being

nade to recruit marchers on a pay-your-way basis. Although

Local authorities have been gravely beset with demonstration

problems, by the same token demonstrators have experienced

a drain on funds and energies which may have developed a

recruiting problem.

All divisions have been ordered to alert Klan and hate

informants, racial informants, and other sources to obtain specific

details concerning the formation of delegates, mode of travel,

and other pertinent details.

All divisions have likewise been

instructed to maintain close liaison with security informants

for information as to possible participation of subversive

organizations.

Each SAC has been impressed with the fact this

is a personal and continuing responsibility.

The Domestic Intelligence Division has learned that an

official of the Communist Party USA at a meeting of functionaries

held 7/11/63 stated the party should finance people to attend the

march on Washington, although no formal organization exists along

these lines.

The possibility of communist participation has

been furnished to the Civil Rights Division and the Internal

--

Security Division of the Department by Domestic Intelligence.

Any further developments along this line will be made known

immediately to interested divisions of the Department and other

appropriate agencies.

The assurance of orderly activity given by demonstration

leaders is complemented by recognition of their right to demonstrate

announced publicly by the Administration, the incentive that

violence might prejudice possible passage of favorable legislation

plus advanced planning by the Washington Metropolitan Police

Department.

Washington Field is maintaining close liaison with

the Metropolitan Police Department so as to be informed of plans

of local police authorities.

Reports from a confidential source which has been

authorized to provide close coverage of Clarence Jones, the

attorney for Reverend Martin Iuther King, JI., will be

watched closely by the Domestic Intelligence Division for

pertinent information for our own intelligence and dissemination

purposes. Initially the Attorney General requested such coverage

of the Reverend Mr. King but later indicated he had decided not

i to authorize such.

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont

RE: MARCH ON WASHINGTON

The Laboratory Division is alerted personnel-wise

and equipment-wise as to the special needs for photographic

coverage and other possible demands for urgent laboratory

examinations as well as communication needs of-the Washington

Field Office and has coordinated this matter with Washington

Field.

The Special Investigative Division, which occupies

first floor space in close proximity to the public entrances

and public corridors, has especially alerted all employees

to the need for the utmost discretion in their conduct both

In and out of the building, the need for security precautions,

and the desirability of remaining away from windows and

continuing in their normal duties during any demonstration

which might occur.

Pursuant to my memorandum of 7/19/63 all

other divisions also have been alerted to emphasize to all

employees the need to be most circumspect in conduct in and

out of the building and to re-emphasize our socurity precautions

which are always in effect.

As previously indicated Washington Field Office is

coordinating the investigative activities necessary for coverage

of events which may take place, and pursuant to my memorandum

of 7/19/63 Supervisor Joseph C. Trainor, Room 2266, is correlating

information concerning the demonstration at the Seat of

Government.

The suggestion of the Laboratory Division that some

•Seat of Government bureau automobiles should be dispersed away

from the building so that any bottling up may be prevented has

been referred to the Administrative Division for consideration.

As a matter of information, WFO has advised the cars

of the Hashington Field Office will be operated out of the

usual storage facilities, located out of the proposed

demonstration area, and controlled from the investigative

headquarters of the field office, being deployed as the need

for coverage develops in the event of a demonstraties.

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont

RE:

MARCH ON FASHINGTON

The Administrative Division, in addition to

alerting all employees, has noted the

possibility that

a larger-than-usual number of applicants for Bureau

employment might appear on August 28, 1963, and, therefore,

has

made

arrangements for a sufficient supply of materials

and the presence of Special Agent Supervisors to conduct

applicant interviews called for.

The Administrative Division has also been in

contact with the Superintendent of the General Services

Administration Protection Branch for the Justice Building

which has advised that maximum available guard force will

be arranged for August 28 through adjusting reporting bours,

changing days off and in some cases cancelling annual leave

of guards.

Superintendent of the protection Branch has

advised that if developments appear to warrant it, con-

sideration will be given to closing all entrances of the

Justice Building with the exception of the Ninth street

and Pennsylvania Avenue entrance

"and" the fent Street

automobile entrance, both of which are patrolled by guards.

The Inspection Division has alerted all personnel

with reference to security precautions and conduct and is

--

submitting a separate memorandum to that effect.

Although separate memoranda are not being submitted

at this time by divisions other than those named above, the

following action has been taken by these divisions as of

July 29, 1963.

The Identification Division, although housed in a

building to which the public is not generally admitted, has

arranged to establish extra security patrols on each entrance.

In addition, Special Agent Supervisors will be stationed in the

vicinity of entrances during the duration of the demonstration.

However, so as to avoid generating à premature wave ol alarm

among clerical employees of the IdentifIcation DIvIsion,

actual discussions of special security precautions will be

withheld until a later date.

The Training Division has, in addition to alerting

employees, instituted considerations as to whether a possible

4-.

training schedule change will be necessary in view of the

problem of traffic congestion and demands on housing which

may occur during the demonstration. The Training Division

" Will be in contact with the Administrative Division on this

point.

Files and Communications Division, in addition to alerting

personnel,. will take extra precautions with respect to the

courier service between the Riddell, Justice and Identification

Division Buildings noting it may become necessary. to reroute

or suspend this service temporarily. The security patrol

force will be especially alerted and consideration will be

given to locking the doors to this division's space if

developments so varrant.

The Crime Records Division has advised that no

additional action is being taken at this time in addition to

the general alert already in effect.

pertinent information received from our racial, Klan and

On April 17, 1959, a source advised that on February

12, 1959, a Socialist Workers Party (SWP) minority group,

under the leadership of National Committee member, SAM BALLAN,

split from the SwP.

The source stated that this minority group, referred

to as the Marcyites, after many years of program and policy....

differences on varied issues concerning tactics and interpre-

tation of political events,

split from the SWP on the grounds

that the Party was liquidating itself by departing from the

Marxist precepts of LEON TROTSKY and retreating from the fight

for the world socialist. revolution. The final issue which

ultimately forced the split was the minority's opposition to

the SWP regroupment policy which involved cooperation with the

Communist Party (CP) periphery - Individuals characterized by

the minority as petty-bourgeois:

The minority program,

according to the source, advo-

cates unconditional defense of

the Soviet Union and has

as its

goal the building of a revolutionary party with a complete

proletarian orientation for the purpose of overthrowing capi-

talism in the United States and throughout the world.

On May 12, 1960, the source advised that this minority

group had chosen the name

Workers World Party..

-—

on April 18, 1962, the source stated that the head-

quarters of the Workers World Party were located at 46 West

2lst Street, New York, New York.

demonstration in Hashington, D. C., on August 28, 1903,

was discussed.

It was mentioned that the. Communist Party,

UBA, (CP), will do everything possible to participate and

¿o use this demonstration. Carl Winter made it clear the

CP is not happy at all because Presideni Kennedy spoke

an effort in Detroit on

the previous day to try and find out about the march on

washington, scheduled for August 28, 1963, and no one seemed

to know anything about the affair.

he could find out at the NAIC? Office in Detroit was that they

have a train schedule to Hashington.

Winter commented that

the only thing he knew of at the present time was that one

train holding 750 people would be going from Detroit to

Washington and that this was not sufficient participation.

APPENDIX

WOMEN'S PEACE AND UNITY CLUB,

Formerly known as the

Chicago Women for Peace

The sins and purposes of the Chicago Women for Peace

(CWP) as

set forth in its self-identified publication, "Chicago

Acts for Peace" (CAP), May, 1951, Issue, describes this organi-

zation as a "service center for

women working for peace." This

publication described the CHP as being affiliated with the

American Women for Peace and as cooperating with the American

Peace Crusade (APC).

The January, 1954, Issue Of "CAD" announced the dis-

solution of the American Women for Peace and the affiliation

of the CWP with the APC Council in Chicago.

A source advised in November, 1956, that the CWP

remained affiliated with the APC, Chicago, until that organiza-

tion dissolved In September, 1955. The CHP continued with no

national affiliation until Sopteuber, 1955, shon a "reorganiza.

tion and name change took place," and

it became known as the

"Women's Peace and Unity Club" (WPUC).

The reason given for this

"reorganization and name change" by DOROTHY HAYES, Secretary of

the organization at that time, was

that the CiP had been formed

to end

the Korean War, and since that war was over and there was

a "measure of peace in the world," women's interests were more

centered on such issues as civil rights, desegregated and better

schools, juvenile delinquency, equal opportunities for women,

housing,

and cost of living.

Source advised that the only actual

"reorganization" of the CWP was the change of its name to "Women's

Peace and Unity Club."

A second source advised in October, 1956, that the

Comunist Party (CP), Illinois-Indiana District, had ordered the

dissolution of the CHI because it no longer served the purpose

of the Party since It was a "left-wing" peace group.

Though the

CP refused to dissolve and chose to continue in the form of

the "Womens Peace and Unity Club,"' It continues to be a "communist

front organization" whose policies and activities are directed

by CP members.

A third source advised on May 14, 1963, that the WUC,

as of that date, continued to operate in the chicago area as a

peace organization under the direction and controlcof CP members

and its objectives continued to be the same.

The American Women for Peace and the APC have been

designated pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

WORKERS WORLD PARTY

On April 17, 1959, a source advised that on

february 12, 1959, a Sccialist Workers Party (SWP) minority

group, under the leadership of national committee member SAM

BALLAN, known in the SWP as SAM MARCy, spllt from the SWe.

referred to as the Marcyites, after many years of program

and policy differences on varied issues concerning tactics

and interpretation of political events, split from the

swe on the grounds that the Party was liquidating itself

by departing from the Marxist precepts of LON TROlsAY

and retreating from the fight for the world socialist

revolution.

The final issue which ultimately forced the

split was

the minority's opposition to the SWe regroupment

policy which involved cooperation with the communist Party

(CP) periphery - individuals characterized by. the minority

as petty-bourgeois.

The minority program, according to the source,

advocates the unconditional defense of the Soviet Union

and

has as its goal the building of a revolutionary party with a

• complete proletarian orientation for the purpose of over-

throwing capitalism in the United States and throughout

the world.

On May 12, 1960, the source advised that this

minority group had

chosen

the name workers world Party with

headquarters located at 46 west 2ist Street, New YOrk,

New York.

The SWP has been designated pursuant to Executive

Order 10450.

drift towards war and the outlawing of the COMMUNIST PARTY (CP)

has accentuated the need for all radical, progressive and

liberal forces to unite in a common party."

In a leaflet entitled "Call to Progressive Minded

America" issued by the INVP, its founding convention was

scheduled for November 25, 1961, in New York City. The aims

and purposes were listed

as:.

L. For the

resurgence of the American Labor Movement.

2o For the winning of the struggle for Negro rights.

3..For an end of the cold war.

1. For economic security and higher mass living standards.

5. For the end of the exploitation of man by man.

•A source advised on December 19, 1961, that CLARENCE

COGGINS is considered the Provisional Chairman of the uNVe.

Other active members include BERNARD (WHITEY) GOODFRIEND, ALVIN

OLIVER, WILLIAM CLARK, and RODNEY OLIVER.

A second source advised on December 12, 1959, that

CLARENCE COGGINS, BERNARD (WHITEY) GOODFRIEND, ALVIN OLIVER,

WILLIAM CLARK, and RODNEY OLIVER were all members of the Harriet

T'ubman Section of the Essex County, New Jersey,

CP, which was

expelled from the Party with no right of appeal by action of the

17th National Convention, CP, USA, being held December 10-13, 1959.

A third source advised on March 7, 1962, that the

SOCIALIST HORKERS PARTY (SWP) and the LNVP are working closely

'In efforts to bring disgruntled CP members to their respective

camps and are working jointly in the political field. FARRELL

The third source advised on June 26, 1963, that due

to mutual suspicion the drive toward unity between these two

rrganizations has ceased.

On January 15, 1963, the first source advised that

the INVP is now using the name LABOR-NEGRO VANGUARD CONFERENCE

(LNVC) and is the name the organization is now known by and

under which name all leaflets are issued.

LNVC does not exist on a national scale; and although CLARENCE

COGGINS, Chairman of the LNVC, has

traveled through the eastern

MARCH ON WASHINGTON

ington March Committee.

Reverend Lovell Johnson, a Pastor

in a Minneapolis church having a predominantly Negro member-

ship is known to have commented that, the March having been

given so much publicity, it would be difficult to keep out

the communists and other sübversives. Mr. Chivers, however;

ultimately did bring the support of the NAACP behind the Minne-

and was given assurances that every

possible measure would be taken to keep the Minnesota dele

gation free of subversive influences.

The contributions made to the Minnesota Committee

have not as yet been completely tabulated. It is known

that a number of labor groups have promised support.

Thusfar, according to both MP T-1 and MP T-2,

there has been no appreciable nor effective communist or

otherwise subversive influences on the activities of the

Minnesota March to Washington Committee.

In July 1963, Betty Smith, who is an active and

leading member of the Minnesota-Dakotas District of the

Communist_ Party. (MDDCP), had made attempts to place certain

individuals which as yet have been unnamed by her on the

committee and in the delegation from Minnesota which will

go to Washington. It is known that on the morning of August

12, 1963, Ralph Taylor, Chairman, MDDCP, approached another

member of the MDDCP to discuss the possibilities of having

& person named by Taylor go to Washington with the Minnesota

delegation.

MP T-1 has indicated that the participation

of this individual in the March is an extremely remote

possibility.

The Minnesota delegation will depart Minneapolis-

St Paul International Airport on a chartered American

Airlines plane between 3 A.M. and 4 A.M. on August 28,

1963.

Before any person will be permitted to board the

plane that person will be required to execute a formal

non-violence pledge which restricts that person from engag-

ing in violence of any character whatever the provocation

might be.

The pledge cautions that any participant in the

delegation who is involved in violence will be summarily

abandoned by the remainder of the delegation and will not

be permitted to return to Minneapolis aboard the chartered

plane.

MARCH ON WASHINGTON

August 28, 1963

•SI I-1 advised on August 9, 1963 that the headquarters of

the Negro Américan Labor Council (NAIC) in New York City was sending

to the st. Louis area approximately 8,000 leaflets and 500 three to

four page booklets pertaining to the March on Washington. These

were for dissemination among people possibly Interested, however,

organizations in the St. Louis area were being invited to partici-

pale in the march and these organizations included integrationist

organizations, labor and social organizations.

Source stated that

attempts are being made at this time to raise funds to finance the

trip to Washington inasmuch as

It had been ascertained that the

chartering of a bus would cost approximately $800.00 or more from

St. Louis. This source said no bus had yet been chartered inasmuch

, as personnel willing to go are lacking.

this source also stated that the plans call for the

hiring of a Greyhound Bus which would take the group to Washington,

D. Cos where they would remain during the daytime only and immediately

return with no stopover.

The source stated that there was a feeling

among NALC leaders that

the Committee on Racial Equallty (CORE)

was attempting to take over a part of this march and this was

resented on the part of NAIC officials.

This source reiterated

that there is no enthusiasm in'St.' Louis for this trip. He knew

of no one who was going.

would be a very small representation

MARCH ON WASHINGION

August 28, 1963

CONFIDENTIAL

Involved. SL T-2 advised that he felt attempts were being made

to make the trip a peaceful one in every respect and that at least

from the St. Louis area there was a feeling that any demonstration

In Washington which might take place might center around the

UnIted States Senate inasmuch as it was felt the greatest problem

with civil rights legislation and civil rights matters was

encountered in the Senate of the United States rather than any

other branch of the Government. This source knew of no one who

was making the trip.

SI I-3 advised that to his knowledge no one was going

from the st.

'Louis area on the Washington, D.C. trip on August 28,

1963 and he felt the reason for this was the cost involved especially

as it applies to those who might make the trip not being financially

able to do so.

SI T-4 advised on August 8, 1963 that it was his under-

standing nearly forty people had expressed an interest in making

the trip

to Washingion, D.C., and that this number would be one

bus load.

This source

stated that it is his understanding there

would be

three drivers on the one bus in order that the bus would

not make a stop en route to washington or on, the return trip.

This

was to avoid the possibility of incident.

This source stated that

the bus, which would be Greyhound, would not be in Washington, D.G.

more than twelve hours and it was

anticipated no problems en route

except possibly in the Immediate suburban area around Washington,

• D.C.

On August 9, 1963, SI I-5 advised that Owen Lutz,

'whom

the informant described as a member of the Freedom of the press

Committee (characterized in the attached appendix), stated that™

he had attempted to contribute to the National Association for the

Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), St. Louis, Missourte

sufficient money for the transportation of Dolores Richardson

for the trip on August 28, 1963. This source described Dolores

Richardson on August 9, 1963 as

a member of the Communist party,

Sto Louis, Missours.

SI T-5 also advised at this time that Owen Lutz was

refused by the NAACP in his offer for a contribution to have

Dolores Richardson go. The source said that the NAACP had advised

RE: MARCH ON WASHINGTON

CONFIDENTIAL

Iutz that they would not take his money nor would they permit

Dolores Richardson to make the trip under any circumstances

In view of the fact that she was a woman of loose morals and

one whose character was no good and could only bring discredit

upon the NAACP.

This source knew of no one who was making the

trip to Washington, D.C.

SL T-6 advised on August 8 and 9, 1963 from information

available to him even though there have been two inquiries made

regarding bus transportation to Washington, D.C., no plans have

yet been made to actually charter or reserve a bus to go to.

the st. Louis area.

This source advised

that it was his understanding inquiry has also been made in

Kansas City, Missouri regarding the chartering or reserving of

a bus to leave from Kansas City, Missouri and a second bus to

no actual reservations. The source stated that the cost of

chartering a bus would

be somewhere between $800.00 and $900.00

and that no bus could be reserved until this money were actually

deposited.

This source also advised that if a Greyhound Bus were

chartered for the occasion, the bus would go non-stop from St. Louis

to Washington, D.C., and non-stop return and takes approximately

24 hours for the

trip one way.

This source stated that the only

stops the bus would make would be for rest periods and food and

the food facilities where the bus would stop would only be those

utilized by Greyhound.

This source also advised on August 9, 1963

that unless a bus were reserved or chartered about ten days

before

August 28, 1963, It would be very difficult to charter one after

that time for the 28th.

March, 1954, advised that the principal activities of the

communist Party in the St. Louis area at that time were

concentrated in various front organizations of which the

Freedom of the Press Committee was one.

In May, 1963, a source advised that the Freedom of

the Press Committee is one of the front organizations in the

St. Louis area in which the activity of the communist Party is

concentrated; that the committee's purpose continues to be

distribution of "The worker"; and that the organization has

been continuously under the complete control and domination

of the Communist Party in the St. Louis, Missouri anea since

he became acquainted with It in 1955.

The "Dally Worker" was an East Coast Communist

Re: MARCH ON WASHINGION

August 28, 1963

The article stated that the buses will leave Cleveland

at 7:00 PM On August 27, 1963, and will leave Washington as soon

the demonstration is over on August _28, 1963.

on the same date, another article in the cleveland

"Plain Dealer," reflected that the cleveland chapter of the

Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) plans to send a total of

To persons on two chartered buses to the August 28, 1963:

demonstration. The article reflected that the buses will

leave Cleveland at 12:00 midnight on August 27, 1963.

On August 12, 1963, a source, who has furnished

reliable information in the past, advised that the buses

sponsored by CORE will return to Cleveland as soon as the

march is over in Washington on August 20, 1903. He stated

ne had neard that two or three members of the socialist

Workers Party I sup! might go to Washington for the demon-

stration but did not know

as yet if they would go with the

CORE group. He stated that these SWe members do not plan

to cause any trouble and would not make their identities

as SWP members known if they go with a group.

The SWP has been designated by the Attorney General

of the United States pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

An article

in the August 12, 1963, Issue of the

"Chronicle-Telegram," an Elyria, Chio, daily newspaper,

reflected that the Reverend George Short, President of the

Elyria chapter of the NAACP, announced that his group would

hire a bus to take Elyrians to Washington for the march on

August 28, 1963.

Re: March on Washington

August 28, 1963

The Bennington, Vermont daily newspaper "Bennington

Banner," issues of July 31, 1963 and August 6, 1963, reported

the formation of the "Vermont March for Civil Rights" at a

gathering in Bennington on July 30, 1963 to organize partici

pation in the March on Washington to be held August 28, 1963-..

::Irving Adler. (also known as Isaak/Adler) and his wife, Ruth

(Adler, were mentioned as being active in the organizing group.;

These news articles indicated efforts have been made

to enlist endorsement and support by local church groups and •

by the Bennington Labor Council. It was reported that as of_

August 6, 1963 15 persons have indicated their intention to

make the

trip to Washington, D.C., traveling by bus (Yellow

Coach Lines, Inc. of Pittsfield, Massachusetts), leaving

Bennington the morning of August 27, 1963 and returning late

on August 28, 1963.

On January 24, 1952, Patrick J. O'Halpin,

Bayside, Long Island,. New York, a self-

admitted former member of the Communist

Party (CP), advised he knew Ruth Adler,

wife of Isaak Adler, to have been a member

of the Bayside club of the CP in 1945-46.

O'Halpin stated most of the meetings of

the Bayside club were held in the homes of

2 members, 1 of them being Isaak Adler.

HH 55180 DocId: 32989649 Page 1236

## Page 1237

He advised Ruth Adler attended meetings of

the Bayside club during 1945 and 1946,

during which time O'Halpin observed the

CP membership cards of Adler and other

members of that group many times, when

they paid their dues

at club meetings.

O'Halpin advised that Ruth Adler's husband,

Isaak, was the first chairman of the

Bayside CP club.

On August 11, 1954, Confidential Informant

AL I-1, who has furnished reliable infor-

mation in the past, advised Ruth Adler was

a subscriber in 1954 to "The Worker" and

"The Worker" is an East Coast.communist

newspaper.

"The Daily Worker" was an East Coast daily

communist newspaper, which suspended publi-

cation on January 13, 1958.

Confidential Informant AL. I-2, who has

furnished reliable information in the past,

advised on January 30, 1953 that Isaak

Adler, husband of Ruth Adler, was a CP

member from at least 1943-49.

"Burlington Free Press,

The Burlington, Vermont daily newspaper,

issue of August 7, 1963 reported

Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) had called upon all

northern Vermont civic, religious and labor groups to join

in plans for the August 28, 1963 'March on Washington for

the bus would leave Burlington Tuesday evening, August 27,

1963, arriving Washington, D.C. the next morning, leaving

that night and arriving in Burlington early Thursday

morning, August 29, 1963.

On Auigust-8, 1963, DI.M. Alfred Haynes, Presi-

dent of the Burlington Chapter of the NAACP, stated that

chapter is composed OF approximately 100 paid members, but

he did not know at the present time how many of these

members would participate in the March on Washington. He Ut

said Burlington and Bennington, Vermont were the two

coordinating areas for participants in the March on

Washington. |DI. Haynes advised that plans for the trip

to Washington hinge upon the number of persons going and

said August 17, 1963 had been set as the deadline for

FAIR PLAY

L FOR CUBA COMMITTEN

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times"

newspaper

contained a full-page advertisement captioned "What

Is Really Happering In Cuba," placed by the Fair Play for Cuba

Committee (FFCC) •

This advertisement announced the formation

of the FFOC in New York City and declared the FPCC intended to

promuigate "the truth abou" revolutionary Cuba" to neutralize

the distorted American press.

"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961,

reported that at a hearing condusted before the United States

Senate Internal Security Sukcommittee on January 10, 1961, Dr.

Charles A. Santos-Buch identified himself and Robert Taber as

organizers of the FPCO. Hs aiso testified he and Taber obtained

funds from the Cuban Government which were applied toward the

cost of the arore-mentioned advertisement.

On May. 16, 1963, a source advised that during the

first two years of the FPOC's existense there was a struggle between

Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP) elements to

exert their power within the FPOO and thereby influence FPCC policy.

However,

during the past joar this

source observed there has been a

suCcessin AfLor+ ry FPOO Ieadership to minimize the role of these

and other orcanizations in the FPCC so that today their influence

in negligible.

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that the

National Headquarters

of the FPCC is located in Room 329 at 799

Broadway: New York City.

According to this source, the position

of National Office Director was created in the Fall of 1962 and

was filled by Vincent "Ted" Lee,

who now formulates FPCC policy.

This source observed Ice has followed a course of entertaining

and accepting the cooperation of many other organizations including

the CP and the SWP when he has felt it would be to his personal

benefit as well as the

• EPCO:S.

However, Lee has indicated to this

source he has no intonsion of

permitting FPCs policy to be determined

by any other organization.

Lee feels the FPCO should advocate

resumption of diplomatis relations between tuba and the United States

and support the right of Cubans

to manage their revolution without

interference from other nations, but not support the Cuban

1 revolution

per se.

The CP and ike SwP have been designated pursuant to

Executive Order 10450.

RE: HYMAN DAVID JENKINS

A fifth source reported that at a meeting of

the CLS on March 25, 1957 held for the purpose of dis-

cussing the school's future, JENKINS said that he was

the person who had started the els and had for many years

devoted a tremendous amount of time and work toward the

school. JENKINS said that during the past few years the

school had adopted a policy with which he did not agree

and. that if the school continued to teach the present

courses he did not see why he should assist it. JENKINS

said that if the CLS would change its political orientation

from pushing a pro-Marxist line andævote itself simply

to educating the working people in the San Francisco area

along the lines of general educational courses he would

again be willing to support the school.

A sixth source advised on September 25, 1957

that at a CP meeting held in September, 1957, It was

mentioned that JENKINS dropped from the Party but was not

an enemy of the Party.

A seventh source has in recent years advised

that JENKINS was working from time-to-time in attempting

to raise funds for the defense of officials of the Inter-

national Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers who were

convicted of violation

of the Labor-Management Relations

Act, 1947.
