estimated

at $60,000 per year.

The file indicated that

On May 20, 1965, HART advised that their investi-

gation of CIVELLO,

which has involved numerous surveillances

in the past, has failed to indicate that he has been in

personal contact with DRAGNA.

HART advised their files contain

no information to indicate that DRAGNA has a close relationship

with CIVELLO other than the fact that they possibly belong to

the Italian-American Club and attend various Italian functions.

Spot surveillances conducted by Bureau Agents have

failed to indicate that CIVELLO is associating with DRAGNA

that DRAGNA is visiting the Airway Liquor Store owned by

CHARLES CIVELLO.

1965, concerning the person or persons who possibly leaked

the

information that FBI Agents were checking accounts at the

Merchants State Bank.

Informant stated he was originally of

the opinion that JOHN DRAGNA was the one who tipped off the

individuals concerned, but now he is not sure inasmuch as

any employee of the banko who was aware of the Agent's

presence, could have fased on the information.

Informant

advised on his previous contact, he assumed that it was DRAGNA

but that he had no proof nor had he received any direct

information that DRAGNA was responsible.

In view of the fact that the informant can offer

no concrete

information as to the person or persons possibly

Re report of SA John B. Hotis dated 4-9-65.

to the effect that John Dragna, a member

of the Board of Directors of the Merchants State Bank, Dallas

is Civello's contact with the Merchants State Bank as

well as

the contact for other local racketeers. This informant also

reported that when the records of that

institution were recently

checked by your office; Dragna immediately notified Civello and

several other racket figures who formerly had accounts in that

bank:

It would appear from the above action on the part of

Dragna that his position with the bank is being utilized to the

advantage of the hoodlum element.

there would appear to be some degree of influence exerted on

a bank official by the hoodlum element.

In conductingsyour criminal intelligence investigation

of Civello, this situation should be more fully explored to

determine the extent of

. Dragna's relationship with the hoodlum

element and the degree of hoodlum influence being exerted on

hin and the reasons therefor. Inguiries should also be made.

to determine whether Dragna is related to Louis Dragna,

Los Angeles hoodlum. You should also be alert to the possibility

of Dragna, in his capacity as a bank official being involved

in a violation of the banking laws.

Upon obtaining more detailed information regarding this

matter, a comprehensive letterhead memorandun should be submitted

to the

Bureau in accordance with previous Bureau instructions

relating to Hoodlum Influence in Banking Institutions.

In view of the information received to date, you should

be circumspect in your dealings with the Nerchants State Bank

NOTE: Civello is a ICN member residhe tin Di currently being
