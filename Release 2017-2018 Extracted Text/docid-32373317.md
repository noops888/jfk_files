enclosed coples of several 1963/1964 documenta from the Chicago

Field Office'« file on GAIN, which ADC/PSD forwarded to SRS with

the comment that 'It appears DCS is cleaning out their fllon se Lee

Harvey OSWALD, et al.".

2. Subject, it is obrious, had been a source of information

regarding an alleged discussion of the assassination of President

Kennedy at a secret mooting of the Fair Piay for-Cuba Committee

held in Chicago in Fobraay 1963 under the direction of Richard

CRILEY ($346 116). He also was the source of laformation regardiag

the alleged attempted secruitment into the Communist Party of young

•Cubans in the Chicago area by one Guillermo ESCOBAR, who sccord-.

Ing to the Chicago office was "one of Horace SPEED'« (SAS) leads

obtained from Ralph PEREZ." (Presumably Ralph PEREZ, 8144260)

During review of CAIN's Security file, I noted a message

regarding him from Mexico City, on 25 April 1962,which mentioned

a "Willard ANDREWS, reputable American businessman in Mexico,"

who obviously had had contact of some kind with CAIN, as well as with

a CIA representative in Mexico to whom ANDREWS had commented that

CAIN claims to have been with OSS during W. W. II (A copy of this memo-

he made to have worked with Task Force W, could be substantiated. The

Station was advised that he did have (or had bad) a legitimate detective

laboratory in Chicago.

4. With reference to Willard ANDREWS, Security indices contain

no record. I believe the individual referred to is Wyllya ANDREWS,

(Edward) Wyllys ANDREWS IV, $2769, a former OSS/CIA employee who

has lived in senter many

has lived in Mexico for many years and has continued to have social con-

tacts with representatives of this Agency in Mexico as well as with Agency

employees from Headquarters who visit him from time to time. ANDREWS,

like CAIN, was born in Chicago of parents who also were born in the general

area of Chicago.

5. The firettime CAIN came to the attention of the Security Office

was when the Mexico Station requested traces on him. Their request

stemmed from an unannounced visit he made to the Station, during which

he stated that he had an investigative agency in Mexico with branches in

Chicago and Los Angeles.

He had also stated that his agency in Mexico

was for the purpose of training Mexican Government agents in police

methods, in investigative techniques, and in the use of the lie detector;

and had added that he was investigating Communism in a certain unnamed

Central American country.

6. In June 1962, the Mexico Station advised that CAIN was being

deported by the Mexican Ministry (of) Gobernacion for these violations:

a. Carrying a loaded revolver and brass knuckles

b. Impersonating a Mexican Government official

(He had identification as an investigator for the

Mexican Treasury Office.)

c. Violating his tourist permit by working at his

detective office and at the Mexican Treasury

7. Sabject was subsequently of interest to the DCS in September

1963 when an ad hoc clearance was requested to permit his being asked

to respond to general requirements regarding his knowledge of certain

Cuban refagees and their potential fox foreign positive intelligence. On

10 September 1963, the DCS was seat a memorandum which furnished

much of the above information on CAIN.

8. On 22 May 1967, the Director of Security indicated that he

had received information from the FBI which ties Subject to the Mafia

in Chicago; and he directed that the DCS be contacted for information

as to whether or not they ever established contact with hima and, if so,

for what purpose. The DCS was also to be advised that, if they were

in contact with him, it was suggested that they break it off. On 25

May 1967, the DGS advised that there had been no contact with GAIN

since 1963, and furnished coples of eight reports for which Subjeet had

been the source of information. These had to do with anti-Castro Cuban

activities, procurement of arms, etc.

9. On 29 May 1967, Sacurity advised the DCS that there is a

current F'BI investigative interest in Subject and recommended that

there be no further contact with him at this time.

10. The 1 September 1967 copy of Life magazine contains an

article titled 'Brazen Empire of Organired Grime," in which it is

stated that Sam GLANCANA, Head of the Chicago Cosa Nostra, is "still

running things by remote control from a hide-out in Mexico... where

he poses as Riccardo SCALZETTI. The real SCALZETTI, GIANGANA's

erst while chauffeur and courier, is more familiar to Chicagoana as

Richard CAIN, a well known former Chicago policeman and more recently

& private investigator."

Il. Eldon S. COHEN who is mentioned in paragraph 2 of this

memorandum as having evidenced an interest in GAIN during the guber-

natorial campaign of the now Senator (from Illinois) Charles H. PERCY,

#178329 and #EE-21773, is now PERCY's Executive Assistant. COHEN,

who became employed by PERCY in January 1964, following his resigna-

tion from CIA which was effective 31 December 1963, at the time he con-

tacted a representative of the Chicago Office of DCS regarding CAIN on

10 February 1964, did not indicate that he was employed by PERCY. He

said, rather, that ho'd been asked by the "PERCY for Governor"' people

to inquire as to CAIN's status.

12. During the timo COHEN was a CIA employee (1949-) 963), ho

was of concern to the Security Oífico, due principally to the activitias

and proclirities of his wife, Rita C. Heller COHEN, #MS-3185, the for

mar wife of Irving ROTH, #MS-2001 R. COHEN was the subject of ai

Employment Review Board case in 1956; and in 1956 was diaqualilled

as a member of the Junior Caree: Development Programa. It was than

decided to put him un a job in I'BIS in which he would not be exposed to

highly sensitive material. At the time of his resiguation, he was an

I. O. Contact, GS-14, in tho Chicago Office of the DDI/DO Contact

Division

13. In January 1965, the DCS requested approval to contact

COHEN on an ad hoc basis to participate in the briefing and debriafing

of his employer, Senator PERCY, woo planned an extensive tour of the

Far East, In June 1967, Mr. George CARY, Legislative Counsel,

requasted a check on COHEN stating that there may be occaaion to brief

him from tima to tima. According to MI. CARY, COHEN would be

brieted genarally on the builà up in Cuba but would not be exposed to

operational information or exotic material.

15. There is attached a copy of the above zeferred to September

articies in Life magazine, in one of which GAIN is described as tha erat-

while chauffeur and courter of Sam GIANCANA. The second of these

articies makes reference to alleged iriendly contasts of Jim GARRISON.

of the OSWALD Case, with henchmen of the Cosa Nostra in the Louisiana

arca.
