3. The product of LIZIIG4's efforts to case tbe

LIRING consulate will be reviered in a separate dispatch

which vill also transnit floor plans and dravirgs o. that

LIRING component.

There is little question that the eug

of LIBING 3'8 arrest in Guaterala gained LIBING 4 tbe syn

pathy of varlous members of LIRING iDcluding LIBING-3, -9

and -16.

They seer to understand LIBING-4'e desire to postpone

her departure for PBRTON after baving receired her long awaited

PBRUVEN visa. The problem now is to have LIEISGA leave for !

PBRUKES while LIRIYG3 is still incarcerated in Guatemala.

mentioned in & recest cable, BOrTOY has encourazed LIRING-4's

plans to try to visit LIBISG-3 in ja1l in Guatenala City ss

BOWTON feels that LIRING 3 will probably urge LIBISG 4 to

spend in PBROWN at least some of the tire he bas to spend in

jall.

As for the conduct of Sergio TALDEZ (BEe BOTTON'S repOrtS

dated 19 april and 6 lay), it appears that the latter has delib

erately been provocating LIRIG 4.

As this Station sees it,

VALDEZ's purpose was to

"shake up" LIBISed in the absence

of LIRING-3 to test her reactions.

It is doubtful that he acted

Indication that he usy have been doing this for the PBRUMEN"s

(although thig is no doubt a possibility).

The Statiou is look

ing into the desirability, at this point, of placing VALDEZ

under surveiilance.

The clain that BOTTON in alias offered

in PERCYEH has to

SEE-RIETY

AUNA • 34531

According to reports subnitted to Wallace B. ROTTON by

LIRING-3, the latter get Carlos Manuel Persaval Marcue origijalls

through the latter's sister-in-law, Carmer'lozada de Ranirez,

who had been carrying on an extra-marital affair bith LIRisG3

since early Jorchber 13÷7.

On the evening of 3 Narch 1960,

approached LIRISG3 in connection

with the difficulties

that a young Cuatemalan woran living in lexico City was havine

in staining false documentatior to enable her to travel to

Guatemala

to recontact her husband,

whon Persaval described as

"an important

guerrilla leader"

Persaval revealed to LIBING 3

that he had been assistirg the FAR in propaganda work in lexico

for some time and

gave LIRING3 several copies of a pamphlet

"Violencia en Guatemala" which Persaval said had been

published on one

of his uncle's presses and ras being sold at tse

nominal price of three lexican pesos to help raise money for the

When LIRISG3.

under ROSTON's direction, responded

favorably to this initial appros'à,

the natter

that he was in touch with two

in returning

clandestinely

asked LIRISG3 to arrange

to guide these persons across the Guatemalan border south of

Chiapas, an

area LIBI'G3 had previously told Persaval he was very

faniliar with fron his previous residence in San Cristobal.

Persaval made no further reference to

foung Guatezzlan wife

of the FAR leader®

LIRING 3 surmised to ROtTO: that this person

night actually have been the wife of francisco Lara Barrios, but

that plans for her return were discarded in favor of the trip

by Lara himself.

At ROTTOY's urging, LIRING3 insisted on neeting the tro

involved and in talking to then before undertaking

such a mission.

Persaval finally introduced LIRISG3 to Francisco:

on 17 March 1968, and the latter presented LIPISG-3

to a certain "Rodolfo", who LIRiNG3 ascertained subsequently zs

a member of the l3th of lovember group headed bj Yon Sosa by the

nane ofSandoval.

Francisco Lara Barrios confided to LIBING 3

that he had in his possession a false Guatenalan passport in tbe

name of Jose Maria Oliva Carranza and that be had obtained legal

residence in Mexico with his wife and children through the efforts

of ex-lexican President Lazaro Cardenas.

He also naned a certaia

& Eskenazi and LIREBEL-1 as persons who assisted Guatemalan exiles

• in derico.

Station believes Eskenazi may be identical with

Luis DavidlEskenassy Cruz, a former agent L

with the approval of RO.ToN, LIRISG agreed to help

the above mentioned persons to cross the lexican/ Guatemalan border

and to accompany them to Guatemala City.

This latter extension of

the original trip was nade by lara at the suggestion of LIRING 3

so that the latter could neet with the FAR soman responsible for

logistics.

LIRING 3 reported to RONTON subrequently that just

before their departure, lara also offered to arrange for LIRING 3

to travel clandestinely to the Sierra de las Minas to neet directly

with FAR and l3th of lovember leaders to discuss further support

that LIRING3 might be able to provide through his corsercial

contacts in Chiapas and northern Mexico.

LIRING 3 fabricated a false Mexican Identify dotument

(Secretaria de Education) for Francisco Lara Barrios in the

name of Jacinto Rangel Cervantes with Lara slightly disguised so

that the latter could move about more unobtrasively on the Mexican

side of the border just prior to crossing.

On 3 April 1958,

just prior to their scheduled departure dale, Francisco Lara

informed LIRISG3 that their mutual friend Bodolfo Sandoval.

would not be accompanying then since he was too well known and

his mission ras not important enough to justify the risk and the

expense involved.

7.

LIRINGS uid not depart as

he had hoped on 5 April 1968,

because Lara unfortunately accidentally shot himself in the ankle

on the norning of that day vile cleaning his gus and had to be .

given nedical attention before he could make the trip.

LIRING4

told RONTOY that LIRING3, Francisco Lara and Rail Sloreno, a

friend of LIRISG3, finally left lexico City in the personal

car of Paul Moreno

on 10 April 1958. but that Moreno had returned

to Mexico City two days later as a result of an accident that

disabled the car sorewhere in Chiapas.

LIRING& did not report

anything concerning the subsequent intolvement of Carlos Persaval

Marcue,

stating that she iad not received any comminication

fron

LIRING} after his telegran of 12 April, in which ke reported

the return of Raul Moreno. RONTO! surmises that wien Raul

Moreno tad

to return to lexico City. LIRING3 a-d Lara asked

Carlos Persaval Marcue to join then and drive then to the border

1=113

sad that Porcaval continued on with then toward

Guatemila City.

8.

advised on 22 Acril 1968,

that

the story of the arrest of Lara, Persaval and LIZING 3 had reached

the local press and

that they would be turned over to the appro

priate courts for trial.

This indicates

that LiBisc3 may

eventually be

released and bence be arailable to BONION for

complete debriefing.

9.

The only significant nase that had surfaced as a result

of LIRIVG3's involserent with the Guatemalan resels in Mexico

City is that of Rolando Mendez Aguilar,

whom Frascisco Lara

Barrios contacted on 45-60-30 extension 27, in early April from

the home telephone of LIRIXG3.

"Publicaciones

(This number corresponds to the

€ Impresiones Mexicaras. S.d. - Diario Ovaciores,

Calle Lago Sirabuen

297, Mexico City).

From the LIFEAT coverage •

on LIRING3 it is apparent that lencez is a close contact of

both Lara and Sandoval

and may be providing or tase provided

emplorent for them in

Mexico.

The Station is attempting to

determine the home address of

lendez in the hope that further

details of his possible collaboration may be uncorered.

On 8 Yarch 1968 PERSAVAL told LIRING-3 that two (2)

LIRING-3 commented that there was limited

brief the Guatemalans so as to facilitaté their illegal

crossing of the lexican/Guatemalan border, or if they desired,

he would guide them.

On 9 March 1968, PERSAVAL again discussed the matter

•with LIRING-3, saying that one of the two travellers possessed

• legal travel documents.

Since the otber person has no such

legal documents, they should enter Guatemala illegally:

CHEXI-47907

LIRING-3 reported on 27 March 1968, that one of the

traveller to Guatemala is FRANCISCO ADALBERTO LARA BARRIOS.

The group is of the opinion that LIRING-3 should also go to

Guatemala in order to meet

an unidentified moran, described

as the FAR logistics officer, to discuss FAR support from

PEXI-5000

Departure was delayed because LARA sustained a self-

wound while cleaning a weapon.

LARA, and another person--described as a member of

the YON SOSA Faction-departed en route to Guatemala.

LIRING-3 was informed that the FAR and the YON

surveillance by the LI EMBRACES.

The results, at least in the

PBRUV phase of this operation, have been unspectacular so

fat.

The main usefulness of LIRING-3 and LIRISG 4 has been

a) as access agents to bikiib, (although this has been

largely reduced to the LIRING

Consulate), and b) to introduce

Wallace B. RONTOS to visiting PBRUNEN officials and members i

of tne local leitist community with access to PaRUlE and

LIRING.

A major effort was started recently to take this

operation

the latter to PBPUJEN on a mission to assess

and hopefully

recruit new sources of information.

The exploitation of

LIRISG-3's contacts with representatives of the Guatemalan

FAR rebel movenert was the object of separate correspondence.

LIRING 3's renewed contacts with these representatives do

not at this time involve PBRUSEN,

although the latter clearly

supports at least some of their activities.

as the situation changed

several times

and LIRING4 did not really know what to expect

from LIRING fron one meeting with its representatives to the

next, not to agzin mention the ups and downs of the LIRING 3/

LIRING4 relationship, which hit a new low during this period.

The Station

would like to point out in passing that, in

addition to

cable reporting and dispatches transnitting

contact reports, the operations in which LIRING-3

and LIRING 4 are

involved in are reviewed in sone detail in

the over-all mouthly report submitted by the PBRCie, Section

of this Station.

The last time LIRING4 accompanied LIRISG 3 to PBRUMEN,

she obtained an entry visa in a few days.

LIRISG4 thus felt

that as

an ex-enployee of LIRING with good connections in

PBRUNE! and LIRING

she would obtain a new PBRUVEY entry visa

fairly

Estry visas are now quite a bit more difficult

to obtain, however,

for PPRUJEN nonofficial citizens abroad.

It also appears that the LIRING staff did not really know

what to make of LIRING-4's stated desire to return to PBRUMEN

for an extended period of time,

as this was obviously based

on a domestic quarrel.

LIRING3 and LIRING4 have had other

quarrels, and the LIRING staff may have thought that this last

one would subside and that LIRING 4 would postpone or cancel

her plans for going to PBRUMEN.

It was to convince the LIRING

staff that the difficulties with his wife were serious that

LIRING- 3. first went to LIRING. In a maneuver to further

convince

the LIRING employees, particularly LIRING 2 and

LIRING 9, that LIRING 4 seriously wanted to go to PBRUMEN as

& result

of donestic problems, ROWTON decided to have LIRING-3

openly question LIRING 4's right to take their child with

ber.

It must be remembered that, in lexico, i wife carnot

leave the country, and especially take a child with hei,

without the express and official consent of the husband. This

little scenario appears to have been well played. On the

other hand, it did

not help LIRING* obtain a visa any (faster.

LIRISG-3 to arrive at a decision regarding their child accept

Specifically, how did LIRING 3 hear of

in 1966, how did he learn of its proposed publication in the

press of a Central American country, how did he obtain the

report on Rico CLAN which he passed to LIRING, and how could

he have learned of certain of the activities of loises OROZCO

Leal?

To all these questions LIRIYG3 replied by saying that

he had good sources in lexico and Central America and that he

was not about to divulge them to the Bruitiers.

BOLD LIRING 2

and Identity in their conversations sith LIRING 3 and LIRING 4

took pains to say that LIRING-3's conduct in his dealings

with LIRING and PBRUMEN was "above reproach." They wanted to

be sure, however,

"had not fallen victim to unscrupulous

elements constantly

surrounding the revviution." To quote the

old cliche, LIRING3 "got their message."

5.

RONTON's introduction to LIRIYG2 and other LIRING

members by Rodolfo REYES Cortes and his subsequent meetings

with LIRING2 were bound to make the latter sonewhat curious

about this wealthy Greek businessman and proclaimed friend of

"the revolution" who seems to travel extensively and appears

to have well-informed and influential friends in many parts

of the #orld.

LIRING-2 was apparently ruffled by ROWTON'S

criticism of

the LIRING efficiency

(see ROWTON's report dated

1 January

sent as an attachment to reference B) since he

finally phoned ROWTON's

"office" after the incident described

in RONTON's 1 January report.

For some reason LIRISG 2 made

the call on a legal holiday when offices

are usually closed,

and the operator of ROWTOY's answering service answered

"Ar. ROWTON's (in alias) office."

This apparently made

LIRING 2 even more inquisitive.

During a

one hour neeting

at LIRING on 15 February LIRING2 asked LIRING& about her

relationship

with

"the Greek."

LIRIXG2 wanted to know where

and for

whom

he

worked, et

cetera.

ROWTON's report of

17 February covers this conversation in detail.

LIRING 2:

appeared to suspect ROWTON may have been one of the sources

of the information passed LIRING by LIRING 3 and warned

LIRING 4 "to go easy with the Greek," if not for herisake, at

least for LIRING 3, who

"has not always treaded on firm ground."

LIRING 4 provided some

"information"

possibility that the PBRUNENers may allor LIRING 4 in their

country to interrogate her about the activities of her husband

and some of her

friends has occurred to RONTON and the Station.

Such a possibility is, however,

most unlikely as the object

of the PBRUMEN suspicions is LIKING 3 and not LIRING4, who

has several times told them that she knows little of what

LIRING3 does.

The nost important consider tion, however, is

contrary,

LIRING-3 has time and again warned them of impending

difficulties or problens.

The fact that LIRIYG4 is married

to a Inxican and that

she enjoys the status of immigrant in

Mexico is also the best assurance that she would be allowed

to reture to Mexico,

The Station agrees with

ROWTOY that LIRING I would, if given a chance, prove herself

to be a good asset.

As for the question of being left with

continuing obligations in this operation, both LIRING 3 anc

LIRINC4 know that there is little ROWTOY could do beyond

providing legal-type advice to bring LIRING4 back to lexico

if the PBRUMENers refused to allow her to returu to ber husband,

an unlikely possibility as mertioned abore in view of current

Mexican/ PBRUMEN relations. The letter of understaing signed

by LIRIXG4 specifies the extent of ROWTON's commitment and

leaves no doubt as to the extent of his obligations.

Station hopes that LIRING 4's relationship with LIRIYG3 will

not improve with time to the point where she will lose the

proper motivation and cover to undertake the mission to PBRUMEN

for which she has been trained and briefed.

The attempt made to exploit Carnen LOZADA's trip to

PBRUMEN to obtain assessments and vulnerability information

on a number of persons she knows who have operational potential

turned out to be a complete failure.

LOZADA ran into such

difficult family problems in PBRUMEN that she had no time (or,

as it turned out, desire) to obtain the information requested:

LIRD:C/4 Report of Questioning by LIRIiG/2 re

Rowton

("The creek").

1. at 1030 on 17 February, 1963, IXIIG/4 inforsed Fonton that she had

aropped into the LIstio offices at about 1230 on 15 February and azain

on the corning of tze folloving day to check with IIRLiG/2 concercing

her entry permit fo= travel to lavana. Cn the first occasion IIRI'G/2

asked her casually bether she had seen anything of the "Breek friend"

lately. IInIiG/4 told norton that she replied that she and LIRING/3 heard

Iron his fron tine to time, rainly by telephone, and that he had invited

her out cocasionally, but she,lIRiG/4, bad turned hin down.

2. Da the ==eond anonnica, dunáro the late maming no AB Fahmulary, 1069;

LIRN:G/2 saw L/4 agin on the preises and asked to not to leave until

she lad seen him, since he wanted to discuss something with ber. wuen she

fibaliy sar him in his office some 30 -inutes later, he again asked whether

she had seen the "Greek", not ventioring Rowton by his alias (farris).

Since I/2 bad mentioned I/4'g Greek friend woon he had met through Fodolfo

Reyes on a previously occasion, llni:G/4 felt she could not preterd at to

know about whon be ras talking. Sne therefore repliea again that cocasional-

1y she heard from tim when he was on a trip to rexico. LINING/2 asked

what 1j4 thought of bin (the Greek), to sick she replied that she found

him pleasant and very generous (bondacoso). I/2 replied, "Yes, but what

does that cenerosity cone fron?" He thea added that he had many question-

marks concerning that person. He save as an exazple the fact that ben be

telephoned his nunter on a holiday, 31 December or 1 cacuary, his "secre-

tary" replied. It seened very strange, continued I/2, that the Greek's

telephone was manned at all times, night and day, and even jon holidays.

He then further expressed doubts about where this person lived and bow

he earned his money, and why be was so interested in Cuba.

3. LIRING/4 stated to Reston that she as st first quite taken aback by

this direct "interrogation", even thougb it was nace in a friendly tone,

and replied as best she could by ear. She stated that she assumed the

Greek was carryinE on lucrative business and lived in jurope alóbough she

could not supply any specific answers. she was aware that he had brought

sore of LIMIliG/3's paintings at an excellent price and took hisgenerosity

for ranted since she enjoyed livine fron the good business LIRING 3 rained

through hin. LINDiG/d then asked If2 why he himself didn't do sone checking

of bis own, since soe assused the that sIninG office was capable of such

activity wben tre occesion called for it. 1I113/2 replied that be bad

too many otber things to do, and angray, when sc-ething smelled bad

("apesta") he Keeps away fron it. 11a11G/4, coatinuing to take tbe of-

fensive, stated that on several occasions intbe past the Greei had invited

her out but sce had not accepted, but tiat sce easily could accept on the

next occasion. ard possibly even obtein a photo of some, kand for II:I:G/2.

L/2 replied that a paoto would not be of any use, all he could do itb

it being to serd it to havana. He aided that he aud many suspicions,parti-

cularly as a result of the telepbone, but nac sothing concrete "ir his

hands", and that what le needed as "datos".

4. LIxIliG/2 then asked I/4 whether she knew then dodolfo Reyes was return-

ing and where he would be living? she told sowton that she relied in the

negative, commenting sinoly that sie had heard that he. rould be coving

to chile to work in the national ballet there. I/2 returning again to the

Greek sondered by ke was so geneross with gifts and entertainment. 1/4

stated that she never looked a gift corse in the south, to which unliG/?

replied that she must be careful, if not for ber oin sake at lease for the

sake of LINI:G/3 woo, ke felt, was nor treading on fira ground "terrexo

firne). I/4 aditted that she was often worried about I/3's activities,

about wich be told ber alnost nothing. Il2 then commented "Invesitigate

the Greek and Jou'il feel better." (iverizua lo del Griego). He then added

that that supposed letter from rico Galán vas sot considered authetic,

and also the case of orozco definitely involved the police: Il-i, since

she was awars that if3 had discussed both these cases with I/2, ercept

that Il3 had not to ber knowledge centioned the arrest of Crozco, stated

that she felt Ils had acted in completely 500d faith, even though ie night

have been somewhat irpalsive ("precipitado").

5. LIRING/2, continuing the conversation, which according to I/4 lasted

over one hour, stated that both she and Ill rust be careful of their con-

tacts. ie conented that he could not even fo out on a date with a firi

without thinking of the consequences. le could so out once maybe, but

he felt it wiser to doop the contact for securit: reasonsl4 told io ton

that she concluded the conversation with a promise to elicit as much data

Subject:

SGSaIZE, Exanination of LIRING/3.

1. Pros about 1330 until 1530 on 29 September, 1957, LIRING/3 was

given an SiS"IRi examination. Rowton arrived at the safehouse ( Tacu-

baja) with the SGurIRi operator at 0930 that coming and remained with

the operator until the exarination was completed. He had not fiven II-

RUiG/3 any previous notice of the nature or exteat of the examination,

but siaply asked his, on 2? September, to keep the entire day of 29 Septen

ber free for a lecithy dicussion with Rowton. Zorton introduced the SG

SIlI operator as señor ilbertini, a trusted "scio", and spent the first

hour or so reviering his relationship with lindis/3, ostensibly for the

visit ii mistin torte- 1h0=,1--d01r to enhjoct of certain

doubts that he had in the past concerning iIRt:3/3's reporting, stated

that Albertini had & means of checking scientisfically the truthfulness

Of LIBI:G/3's statesents. Routon explained that be was particularly con-

cerned about the possiblity of IIRI:S/3 having doubled back with iliG

andraintzining with them a secret agreement of some sort to report on

Rowton and his activities.

2. WRING/3 wiet into a state cf visible snock at this and stated that

even the thought of betraying Rowton had never occurred to him at any time.

when the SiS*Il operator explained the scienti?ic means he was to use on

LIRNiG/3, the latter stated that he could not possibly accept this humili-

ating means of testing hin since it was diarestrically opposed to his

principles. Ee pointed out that he had accepted soton at his word and be

could at see or understand why Rowton could not do the.

same for biz, adding

that the whole thing snacked of nethods used by «OFAST and LIRIiG. He added .

that if this neant that he would have to break with Bouton, then regret

fully he would have to accept this alternative. Be explained that submit-

ing to the SGS. IRe exanination would inevitably destroy the idealistic and

profound relationship which he had previously felt he enjoyed with Bouton.

3. Rorton and the SGS"IRl operator spent the next two hours

calmiss HIRING/; •

down and finally convincing him that he would not be compromising with his

deeply-felt priceiples by taking the test. He at last consented to be ques-

tioned on his lojalty to Rowton and insisted that he be asked, ""Do you be-

lieve in Kowton?"

4. Alter a brief break for lunch the exarination was given inone of the bed

appeared to be in reasonably good spirits after the test, although

he was obvioisy enotionally strained by the experience. Rowton nade

a date to see him again that evening at 2100 tn talk things over in

a claner atrosphere.

5. hi that neeting with IICiC,3 Rowton explained that he had felt it

necessary to ascertain as oujectively as possibly the extent of LIRIlo/3°g

loyalty to him and he was happy to have scientific proof that LIRIlG/3

had not berayed his to the IIRIlG's. LIPING/3 stated that after it vas

all over he felt letter and admitted that he agreed with Roston on the

necessity for such an exanitation, buniliating as it night at first bave

==ao9pà tabe, do censorred that any "amero" lesbedentione and modeeten?

that he bad nade in the past, were due to his intense desire to produce

for Roston, since he still felt very sensitive about baving to accept soney

Iron Boston vithout being able to render commensurate services. He stress-

ed, however, that at no time bad be ever been disloyal to Rowton or done

anything agairst Rowton's interest, as señor Albertial could prove with

the results of the SGS.IRL. LIRING/3 promised in the future to follow Row-

ton's direction serupulously and assured Rowton that he no longer felt.

unde= any compulsion to exaggerate or fabricate anything to impress Ronton.

6. Headquarters and the Station may find the SGSWIRI examination disappotn-

ting in its linited coverage, but it niust be realized that LIRING/3's..

initial reaction des entirely negative and at one point be treatened to.

break off completely with Rowton because of the insult to his "dignity".

Although the SGS:IRI operator felt that from a professional standpoint it

would be better to administer the exaziration at another time when II?ITG/3

vas less enotionally upset, Rowton asked both him and LIRünG/3 to 50 thru

with it on the spot, fealing that psychologically it was essential to

make IIAING/3 sub=it, even for a linited test. Rowt:n also feels tbat the

test did serve as a very favorably deterrent over iIRIlG/3 in the future,

when a second one can be more painlessly adainistered, In a calmer

phere. It, of course, also covered the very pertinent question of whether

KIRING/3 had been an LIRING doible agent or betrayed Roton in any vay.

bad finally nanged to have a private talk with Rocolfo! Reyes Cortes,

his Mexican chereographer friend, ou the afternoon of 27 October, 1967;

and that, in the course of conversation, Rodolfo eyes had revealed

to IIRIlG/3 in confidence that the reason why the IIRiNGS had assumed

a rather cocl attitude toward LIRIXG/3 over the past year. Zodolfo

Reyes explaized that the last time he was in savana he lad heard rumors,

asong bis friends in the lexican colony, that LIRISG/3 was working

"either for MurIaM or the Cubans". Rodollo went o= to

say that the

OrIgIn O1 tois Iumor, as lar as he could ascortain, was the fact that

LIRING/3 had pade two trips into Havana for no know specificreason and

at his own expense. Rodolfo Reyes, indicating that de himself did not

believe the runors or, at least, did not care whether they were true or

not, commented to LIRING/3 that other menbers of IIPING/3's profession

were naturally jealous of the success of anyone of their group and were

always quick to draw their own corclusions.

2. LIRING/3 co-mented to Rowton that, although this news had sbaken hi.

and LIRING/4 badly at the time, neither of them cared particularly wast

the LIRIliGs thought of them, since their own conscience ves cleer.. II-

RIRG/3 added that it was important, however, to continue to develop bis

commercial activity in Chiapas ( especially since acdolfo Reyes' home is

by coinciderce locateà in San Cristóbal) so that cord would gradually.

filter back to the WIllits that he actually did bave financial resources

outside his art production. LIRIG/3 continued that obviously the LInliGs

did not have any specific proof or they would long ago have cut off all

contact with hin as well as LIRING/4. He concluded that since the LIBLiGS

had certain suspicions, they navurally warned all dis friends and forzer

"contacts (lacluding, of course, arnol Rodriquez)

to ayoid close contact

with him until their doubts could be resolved.

3. In reply to howton's query LIRING/3 stated that Zodolfo Rejes and Carmen

Molina (separately) had commented to him that they vere favorably lopresseu

by Rowton ard did not voice any suspicion of Rowton's bona fides (as a

Greet leftist businessman) Carmen Molina, in fact, aad gone so far as to

show some irritation that LIRING/3 had not introduced her to kowton pre-
