Title: JFK RECORDS COLLECTION ACT OF 1992 (The Act)

Synopsis:

Las Vegas is requested to conduct necessary research

pursuant to the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) letter

requiring the FBI's response by 10/21/96.

Las Vegas

is also

requested to send

pertinent files to Headquarters/JFK Task Force as

soon as possible.

The ARRB by letter dated 9/10/96 (copy available upon

request) has requested that the FBI identify all information in FBI

assassination records that the FBI believes is under court seal.

The ARRB's interest in this matter, is to have the Department

of

Justice assist in petitioning the courts to unseal the records so

the documents may be opened to the public as established by the JFK

Assassination Records Collection Act (JFKARCA) .

In accordance with the ARRB letter,

; the FBI must identify

which jurisdictions/judges placed these records under court seal.

• In the case of electronic surveillance, the ARRB also seeks the

location and

the duration of

the surveillance.

Because the

background information concerning these electronic surveillances

are maintained in the Field Office,

we are requesting that the

field do the research necessary to respond to the ARRB's request.

The ARRB seeks the following information:

1) the name and jurisdiction of the judge approving the

electronic surveillance.

the location and duration of the electronic

4) the subject of the electronic surveillance.

Please furnish this information for each file/informant number

indicated at the end of this communication.. This information may

be faxed into HQ/JFK Task Force by secure fax (202) 324-9471. This

information should be furnished to HQ by C.O.B. 10/11/96.

Pursuant to the JEKARCA any materials considered

assassination

records must be

made available to the National

Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in their original form.

The JFKARCA defines how

FBI may now postpone certain

information, but the originals are still sent to the NARA, to be

maintained until the year 2017 when they are to be opened in full.

Therefore, the files will not be returned to your Field office.

since the originals will be sent to NARA, copies of the files

should be made

for record purposes prior

to their shipment to

Headquarters.

All files should be received at Headquarters

later than C.O.B. 10/11/96.

Below are the assassination records maintained in your

Field Office.

Because the copies of the documents we are working

with were put together in 1978 in no real assemblage and many with

no identifying file numbers, we are furnishing you with the best

available information possible. If you have any questions, you may

contact Brian Fields (202) 324-9535 or LuAnn Wilkins (202) 324-9466.

Please ship the following files to FBIHQ, JFK Task Force,
