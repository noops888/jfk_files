Re Miami letter dated 10/24/69.

As previously noted, subject was contacted by a

Bureau Agent in the vicinity of his residence and an appoint-

ment arranged for October 27, 1969.

At that time he voluntarily

presented himself for interview at

the Miami Office and was

immediately friendly and cooperative. He readily furnished

information concerning his contacts with JOSE CARBONELL

MARRERO during the period 1963-1964.

A copy of the FD-302 setting forth details of this

interview is enclosed for the information of the Bureau,

and this interview will be incorporated in the forthcoming

report concerning CARBONELL who is the subject of Bureau

file 105-173672.

HERRERO, although somewhat forgetful and confused

in recalling past

activities, appeared to be genuinely open

and sincere in furnishing information to the best of

his ability regarding his associations with CARBONELL. KIt

appeared that he had not been knowingly involved in CARBONELL'S

activities in behalf of the Cuban Intelligence Service.

mation obtained from HERRERO coincides closely with that

developed in the investigation of this and related cases, and

HERRERO appears to be sincerely anti-Communist and pro-U.S.

in his political beliefs.

He has volunteered to contact

this office with any information received in the future

regarding CARBONELL or any other pro-CASTRO activity.

Accordingly

this case is being closed.
