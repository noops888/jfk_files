on July 30,, 1951, stated that he and his.

companions had

just been in:

Denver, Colorado, where they engaged in a crap game and won approximately

$3, 000.00, that they started to leave the game and it appeared that the

proprietor of the game called the Sheriff's Office inasmuch as the Sheriff

and his deputies stopped SCHEELER. and his companions on the highway

and searched them and the automobile.

SCHEELER' thought the Sheriff

was looking for the money that they had won in the game. but the money

was hidden in the automobile and the Sheriff apparently could not locate

it.

It appears that thereafter SCHEELER accused the officers of taking

the money from his suitcase and thereafter the officers appeared to

become suspicious of each other.

According to SCHEELER after this

incident occurred, he and his companions were released by the officers.

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
