I told him our Ambassador

had received a neative reply

from the Costa Rican Govern

ment as end user about 28 November.

RAY pointed out that

this must have been the second or

even third visit paid by

our Ambassador to Costa Rican authorities on this matter

and he stated he belicves these multiple comings and goings

must have given the Costa Ricans the impression the U.S. is

against the shipment.

• told him apparently Oduber got ou

f touch with current thinking in Costa Rica. but RAI

believes there were just too many visits on the matter.

Per discussion with Mr. Crimmins, I then raised

the possibility of arranging

told Rif that our people felt he would have a better chance

of survivind if he walty another thice to six monthe for

his attempt, and this secmed to cheer him up, but he says

his plans have been progressing very well the past two to

thice months, and I can see he has been kesing himself up

to the action.

I am

told him I would try to find out about this, but

indicated my beller that when several departments

two governments are involved, secrecy cannot well be guaran-

teed, especially when the arms firm involved (Erquiaga) has

been having some legal troubles and is being watched.
