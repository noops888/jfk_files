Title:

John. F. Kennedy Records Collection Act

of 1992 (the Act)

Synopsis: The Act established the Assassination Records Review

Board

(ARRB) to oversee the governments' production and

compliance with the Act.

The ARRB reviews

the proposed

postponements in documents sent to the National Archives and

Records Administration (NARA) and decides what postponements the

Act allows or opens the document in full. The ARRB's

responsibilities include having agencies search other subjects

and areas to find any additional material not already identified

as assassination records.

The establishment of the ARRB by the

Act also limited the time for their duties to be accomplished.

The ARRB must complete their tasks by September 1997.

With this

deadline in mind, the ARRB sent a letter requesting additional

information.

Enclosures: ARRB letter requesting material

Details: On March 10, 1997, the ARRB sent a letter to the FBi

setting forth a formal request to receive and review additional

records.

The ARRB's goal is to research every possible subject

that may have a bearing on assassination theories and to assure

Congress and the American public that all was done to accomplish

the intentions of the Act.

Requested offices should conduct a search for the

listed items.

If offices are aware of any administrative records

they may have maintained outside the normal index system, they

should include those areas in the search.

If any documents

related to the matters are found, please

• forward the documents to

the JFK Task Force.
