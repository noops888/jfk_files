Dear David:

This is to acknowledge your letter of 31 July 1995 to

Director of Central Intelligence Deutch regarding the

Assassination Records Review Board's formal determinations

with respect to certain CIA records.

The appropriate Agency components have again reviewed

the two documents

which the Board has decided to release to

the National Archives in their entirety without redactions.

Please advise the Board that the Agency does not plan to

appeal to the President to postpone the disclosure of these

particular documents.

It is understood that the issues raised in these two

documents may be revisited as they appear in other documents

in different contexts.

We would welcome the opportunity to

discuss with you and your staff any issues that may arise

with respect to declassifying and releasing CIA-originated

information.

Sincerely,

Jhe Perein

John

The Honorable John M. Deutch

Director of Central Intelligence

The Central Intelligence Agency

Washington, DC 20505

Dear Mr. Director:

In accordance with the President John P. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act

of 1992 JFK Act), I am writing to inform you that the Assassination Records Review

Board has made additional formal determinations concerning the public disclosure of

executive branch records.

Enclosed is a list of the determinations that the Review Board has made. These

decisions were premised on several factors including the significant historical interest in

the documents and the absence of evidence that the release of the information would

cause harm to the United States or to any individual.

You have seven days to appeal these decisions to the President. You are invited to send

your representative to the Review Board to examine our copies of the documents for

which determinations have been made and to discuss the determinations with my staff.

Sincerely yours,

Sione

David G. Marwell

Executive Director
