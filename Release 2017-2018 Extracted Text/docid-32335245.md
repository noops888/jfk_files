LaureLy

Mississippi

June 20, 1964

Informant advised that during the regular meeting of The white

Knights of the Ku KIX Klan of Mississippi (WKKKOM) (The Boguehoma

Hunting and Rifle Club) on Tuésday 6/23/64, the situation regarding

CLINTON CLARENCE COLLINS, SRo, was discussed. It was reported that he

• the

car with him. Some of the members were rather "hot" about this and it

was indicated that something might take place if he did not cease this

activityo

It was reported by DON HENSHAW that he had observed several whites

and negros dancing at the Old Negro American Legion Club just off

Highway #59 at the Hast side of Laurel. It was reported (badieved by

HENSHAW) that recently the Sheriff or one of his deputies rode by the

American Legion Club and the person stopped dancing andwent in the back

room, when he left they came back and started the dance again. Some

member of the WIKKOM claims to have fix "peeped" in the window at this

club but did not see anything since the lights were turned out.

He states (FNU) GRAHAM, who lives on the lower Myrick Road, near

Laurel and CECIL SESSUMS,

Preacher from shady Groves Mississippi had

some project recently and several negros were reported to have rur

through the woods,

when frightened. Informant does not know when or

where this happened.

Informant advised that there is very little discussion about the

various projects prior to the time they are carried outo This is due

to no one except the Division leader and LAWRENCE BYRD, acting project

chairman, knowing about it. The Division Leader pickes

his men then

gives them the project and it is up to them to carry it out. The results

of the projects are discussed at the next meeting after carried out.

*

Informant rode to a meeting with B. E. HINTONs ECs recently and HINTON

talked about "leaks" in the organization

He thinks there are about two

and maybe more. He did not identify any of the suspected leaks.

He feels that the recent incident where HEBSTON STRINGER and the other

man were "sworn out" was due to a misunderstanding between SIRINGER and

ED WADSWORTH, POlice from Ellisville, Misso. WADSWORTH was supposed to

attend an initiation but missed the group and felt that sirlnith had

crossed him. This was straightened out and the two men were taken back

into the axux klan on 6/23/640 (They were sworn out by LAWRENCE BYRD)
