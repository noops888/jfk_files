Yes, sir.

During the nine years you were with DDO's Cuban

operations, who was -- who were the chiefs of the Miami

activities with respect to Cuba, did you ever learn of any such

attempts?

A

Well, let me answer it this way. I wouldn't say

attempts. I know there was discussion. "Attempts" is too

strong a word.

Well, can you place in time your first knowledge of

any such discussions?

A

Well, the first knowledge I had of any discussions,

I was on TDY and this was October, November, 1963, with Fitzgeral

in Paris. And I knew that he was going to meet - let me put

it another way. I had overheard that discussions were going on

with a member of Castro's military but that he wanted, as

at one time he was

on.

I didn't participate in it because I was there for another

reason. And I know that subsequent to that time that Fitzgeraid

met with him again and as I recall, as the personal lepresenta-

tive of the Attorney General, Bobby Kennedy.

I provided all those files. There are 19 volumes that

we gave to your people. But I don't know who was reviewing

them. I think Belin was going to do it himself.

Yes. He is. He is doing it himself.

You said there were 19 volumes of documents with

respect to this.

I don't see how. Frank Sturgis is a soldier of

He has constantly tried to associate himself

destroy it, he is an intelligence nuisance."

Have you caused the Agency records with respect to

Sturgis to be assembled in any one location?

Yes. Ihave custody of them.

As I recall, there are five volumes. Your Committee

I guess it was last Saturday. They called for them Monday and

they returned them

Monday afternoon.

examined those files?

No, I don't.

You indicated a moment ago that Mr. Sturgis contacts

the DCD

office in Miami with some frequency, is that correct?

Well, not great frequency but he does with tidbits

of so-called information.

Is this information limited to narcotics, alleged

narcotics traffic?

I can't speak to that but the records that we have

don't reflect anything like that. Before they would contact

somebody in that context, inowing that there is a 201 file

on Sturgis, they would have to coordinate with the Latin

a boat on such an operation, would he be charged with putting

together his own crew?

No. ile had an assigned crew and every boat had

the Miami Station. Sometimes I would assume that we did

You spoke about paramilitary operations and covart

of activities?

A

Well, actually one can fall into the other. The

paramilitary could fall into covert action but in those day's

we did distinguish somewhat. A lot of the covert action was

media placement, We had a number of operations at -- legal-

type operations, harassment operations. For instance, Fidel

seized a great many art treasures and in particular he had a

Napoleonic collection which was supposed

to be the finest in

the world that he sold to dealers in Europe. He had paintings!

Let's tall: about economic warfare for a couple of

moments. Could you describe for me briefly the type of

economic activities that were conducted against Castro?

Well, first of all, we wanted to denigrate the

regime, his credit worthiness, and this type of thing, we

worked very closely with the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs

in

the State

Department and, well, for instance, in those days,

•I

guess it was back in 1964, the price of sugar had jumped iron

about a penny a pound to 13 cents a pound, something like

that, and we couldn't understand why. So we kept -- Fidel let

saying that he had such a poor crop and this type of thing and

we

just couldn't figure out why he had such a poor crop barrasy

some of our own island assets told us they were out there cuttin

this cane like mad and the mills were working 24 hours a day.

this type of thing. So subsequently, we found out that he was

lying and he was storing the raw cane in the schools, any

place. He had no storage facilities and put it any place lie

could.

So in cooperation with a couple of sugar brokers

in

New York, we surfaced this fact and the price of sugar took

real tumble and all of a sudden then Cuba started exporting.

It was this type of thing that obviously he vas

trying

to build up the world price because he didn't have

any

money, he was so short on his exchange, and obviously we didn't

want him to get the exchange. So it was those types oe

activities.

Q

Was the assistance of any u.s.

businessmen or u.s.

companies enlisted

in that effort?

A

2

oh, yes.

In what manner did

you use U.S. companies and

businessmen?

A

Well, we simply used them as the experts. A jicat

many -- the sugar industry in Cuba was controlled by the

American community, by American bankers, and obviously they

lost everything when they had to pull out. Sugar is the

lifeline of Cuba as far as any exchange, foreign exchange. is

type of thing, and it was naturally our Number 1 tarjet. i

was only natural that we would go to the American businessmen.

What kind of assistance did you seek or obtain

these businessmen?

A

Well, we simply talked with them about why -- you

know, the market conditions were, why the price was risini. :

we could find out that fidel has plenty of sugar, what would

happen to the market price. This type of thing.

The thing

we wanted to get at was the oil and the

automotive machinery on the island. lie knew it was breaking

down and if we could get a conplete breakdown we would have

everything at a standstill because in those days the automotiv

equipment wasn't coming in that rapidly from Europe because

Castro didn't hve the money to buy it and they weren't going

The railroad system was in total disaster. The

Soviets had such a long louistics line, supply line, plus

the fact that the cubans didn't like the Soviet equipment

because they were used to good American equipment. And these

were principal targets that we were trying to get to.

to the Soviet Union and I forget exactly now what happened to

it but I know that it got a hole below the waterline, or

something, and had to put into fuerto Rico for repairs.

In order to repair it, I guess, and get it in the

drydock or wherever it was, they had to remove the sugar and

put it in the warehouse and at that time I guess somebody cane

up with a plan to try to widen the rift between -- there was

a rift at that time between the Soviets and Cubans and to

put a harmless substance into the sugar that would make it

acid, sour tasting, and it wouldn't harm the sugar or the

individual, and some of this was done.

And then when it

leaked, of course, we had to get rid of it and we had a sugar

But as far as sabotaging any Cuban product, no, we

When was the Miami Station established?

A

As a

station?

Yes.

I think in September 1961.

And that was several years before you became involved

in Cuban matters?

A

Yes.

Do you know of any other facilities of that natura

You mean, targeted against the opposition?

Yes.

squad in terms of FBI squads. It had 36 people on it, somu-

Yes, yes. You have got to remember, too, that a 10t

of the people on that Cuban squad were in the legal section

of the Embassy in Havana. You know, the fBI overseas is

known as Legal Attaches, obviously working out of the Embassy

the same as our Station was, and a lot of our Station officers

Have you reviewed, Mr. Sturhitts, the Agency's entire

to the Cuban operations and particu-

Yes.

There is no relationship.

Is it your testimony that the records and files of

the Agency reveal no official or unofficial contact of any

To my knowledge that is true.

same Cuban organizations which were being sponsored of funded

by the Agency also had

activities or operations in New Orleans?

I don't know if I can answer that, whether they had

the same functions. I know that some funding arrangement for

subsidizing the organizations in Miami was carried out through

New Orleans.

These people were normally prominent people and --

And did they got funded by the Agency, then, through

A.

These vell-to-do people ostensibly would call a friend,

of theirs that had been made trustee of another type of activity

and say, you know, we are trying to assist these Cubans in this

type of thing. Could your organization give us any money, and

the guy on the other end would say, sure, we can probahly lend

you $25,000 or something like that, or donate $25, 000. This is

the way the funding went into the fronts.

a lot of talk about that.

Did you participate, yourself in the overhearing of

such conversations?

No.

Was this a matter of something that was reported to

you?

A well, it was -- I really don't remember what the

source of it was but I know in my discussions with people at tha

Station and from my visits down there and that type of thing

that this subject always came up. What were they going to do

with Fidel? How are they going to get rid of him and this type

of thing. I don't mean the Agency people. This is what the

Cuban exile community was discussing.

Yes. Do you know what Howard Hunt was doing for the:

too long ago hecause we did have an inquiry and we obtained the

time and the attendance records from the Office of Finance which

showed that Howard Hunt was on sick leave on that day.

was this just fairly recently?

Yes.

I understood from what files I have seen, Mr.

Sturbitts, that the only records that were available from the

Office of Finance showed that he had had nine hours of sick leave

during the two-week pay period ending the 23rd of November but

that the records were not available as to how much sick leave

or annual leave had been taken on any particular day.

A

Well -

Am I mistaken?

A.

As I recall, he was in a duty status one day and a

sick leave status the next day and back to duty the next day.

I would have to check that with my Budget and Fiscal Officer.

He is the chap that got that for me..

BY MR. MANFREDI:

Was there any effort to determine what MI. Hunt's

previous pattern with respect to sick days had peen?

A.

(Nods in negative)

BY MR. OLSEN:

Q. November 22, 1963, was a Friday. When you say that

records reveal that he was on a duty status the next day --

A.

It was a Friday. Then I was mistaken.

Does that mean he was on duty the following Morday

or on the next day, Saturday?

A.

No. On the following Monday. I didn't realize the

22nd was a Friday.

Will you check that thing for us and give us a bries

memo together with whatever supporting - copies of supporting

documents you can find?

A. :

Okay.

As promptly as possible on this question.

I think that covers the subject matter.

MR. MANFREDI: I can give you another moment if you want.

Can you think of anything else?

MR. OLSEN: I think that is all.

MR. MANFREDI: Okay. Off the record.

Sure. If he got information that he thought iris

Yes. He was a contract employee.

And were intelligence requirements levied on such

All foreign nationals.

We levied on the Secret Service as a requirement

that they have identified these people by nationality before

we would run a, name trace. Inadvertently, at one time

they did submit a list, a rather long list of American citizens

which we promptly sent back to them and told them we could

not trace.

And this practice was followed both in 1968 and

1972?

A

That is right.

And where were these names traced?

A

They were traced back here and also in Miami. The

Miami Station did their name check and we did our name check

here. In the case of Cubans, probably the Miami Station had

more information on the Cubans than we would have back here.

Watergate trial.

Some of these allegations that came out

and I think they were carried in the Anderson column but we

made file checks and this type of thing. One particular

activity was supposed to have been carried out in Rockefeller

Center in New York and it turns out it was taken out of

context.

It was a training mission and -- training exercise.

These guys were being trained in surveillance in New York

and they were simply asted to go into a branch of the Manhattar

- Chase Manhattan and to come back out and then they were

supposed to diagram the layout of the bank. And this to some

of them meant casing the bank when in fact it was just a

memory exercise.

exercises conducted?

preted as casing the bank. These exercises were given -- they

who are still in Cuba. I mean, relatives who are in the U.s.

who have relatives in Cuba.

type of thing. He does contact these people all over tha

he might be recruitable, or perhaps we could even double hin,

we will, after we make our preliminary assessment, and we

find out where relatives and these types of people are, we

will ask this career agent or instruct him to go contact

these people, be it New York, New Jersey, Chicago, or what-
