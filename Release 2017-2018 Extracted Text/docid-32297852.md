UNDERWOOD so far as he knew was not a paid Agent of the Cuban

Government; that UNDERWOOD indicated he resides in New York

City, but HERNANDEZ claimed to possess no information further

concerning UNDERWOOD.

HERNANDEZ also confidentially advised that

JESUS ESTRADA, who has been working as an informant for

HERNANDEZ in Miami, has been ordered by CARLOS PRIO to proceed

to Mexico City and to establish contact with CANDIDO de 1a

HERNANDEZ said that ESTRADA is travelling by Greyhound Bus Line

and is scheduled to have left Miami at 9:45 AM, Sturday, July 6,

1957, although he has not been able to definitely confirm

ESTRADA's departure.

He will enter Mexico at Laredo, Texas.

He is supposed to obtain a Mexican Visa at New Orleans, Louisiana.

prior to his departure; JUAN ORTA, who is closely associated

with PRIO and who is the subject of a separate perjury case

oased upon false testimony which oniA gave during January, 1951

frand Jury proceedings, Miami gave ESTRADA a ticket and 825.

in cash.

PRIO, according to HERNANDEZ, gave ESTRADA an additional

$50, in eash and PRIO is also supposed to furnish ESTRADA's wife,

who is supposed to remain in Miami, with $50. every 15 days or so.

HERNANDEZ sald that he,himself, gave ESTRADA $100, in cash and

Instructed ESTRADA to sew this money in the belt line of his

trousers or some suitable place to be used for emergency only.

HERNANDEZ said that he has instructed ESTRADA to participate

in all revolutionary preparations up to the time that the

revolutionists are scheduled to board a boat or plane, at which moment

ESTRADA shout then use his emergency fund for immediate trans-

portation to the nearest city from which point he should

immediately contact HERNANDEZ. HERNANDEZ said that he also

expects to receive progress reports from ESTRADA prior to the

date of final departure.

It appears that JAVES BARTON UNDERWOOD is probably

identical to JAMES BARTON UNDERWOOD, who was the subject in 1943

Bufile 46-2435. Information possessed by Miami in that case
