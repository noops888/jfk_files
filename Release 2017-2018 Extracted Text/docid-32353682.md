Action Required:

See paragraph 1

Forwarded for Headquarters retention are 70 volumes

(5 packages) of the photographic take of LONION from late.

1961 throuch December 1968.

Since the Station is trying to

reduce its volume of hard copy records, it is requested that

Headquarters retire these volumes to

the Records Center so that

in case a need arises, they can be reviewed by Headquarters

The Station suggests that a retention period of 10-yearsfrom

the date of information may be desirable.

The above volumes are being forwarded Headquarters

via the IURADIAL flight of 19 August 1969..
