contain no derogatory information identifiable with STEVENS.

â€¢ de or the

During the course of the interview with STEVENS he made

several references to the tour which he made of many countries

in Africa after leaving Moscow.

In connection with this

he referred

to the way some South African nations are

handling their "nigger problem"

and said our country should

learn a few things from them and get away from the current

philosophy in which we are taking many rights away from

white people and giving them to the black people who have

no basic right to intrude on the private lives of white

people.

Mr. JONES said he feels very strongly on this

matter and it was noted that he appeared to be very loud

outspoken.

This is pointed out as of possible interest

in the event future consideration should ever be given to

using him as a witness.

In this connection it is also noted

that Washington Field Office letter dated October 10, 1963,

said that Mr. MCDANIEL described STEVENS as "an honest,

loyal American, but one who could be described as an 'Ugly

American', in that he did not like Russia, Russians or

anything about them and let them know it at every opportunity."
