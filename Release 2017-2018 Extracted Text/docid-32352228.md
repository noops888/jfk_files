MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Raymond A. Warren

Chief, Latin. American Division

FROM

Norbert A. Shepanek

Office of the Special Assistant

to the DDO for External Oversight

SUBJECT

House Select Committee on

Assassinations' Questions

1. The House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA)

staff

has passed the questions outlined below which we are

unable to answer.

The questions obviously derive from their

research of our

files and/or revelations made during inter-

rogation of our personnel..

Perhaps Mexico Branch or Mexico

City Station could shed some light on these questions.

2.

The first question relates to telephone taps. The

HSCA was provided access to the take from three taps, but HSCA

believes

that there were

five taps. They want to know about

the other two taps - what lines were tapped, location, time

period, and period in operation.

3.

The HSCA staff learned that there were unilateral

taps in Mexico City.

Were these on official Cuban or Soviet

installations?

(There would be little interest if these were

against private residences.)

4.

In the photo coverage of the Cuban Embassy, there

were three camera positions.

Photos made available to the

Committee appear to be only

from two camera positions.

Where

is the coverage from the third position? What dates was it

in operation?

There was a second position from which photos were

made of the Soviet Embassy which carried

the cryptonym LILYRIC.

They would like to see the LILYRIC take.

6. They have asked for the identity of LITAMIL/9.

Could you determine if LITAMIL/9 is an active source and what

relationship, if any, he/she might have had to the assassination?

At this point, we have no way of determining the reason for

their

interest in LITAMIL/9.

7:

We would appreciate if you could give_ this matter

priority attention.
