• OCTOBER 1950

Early in October 1950, DIMITROV visited the Lavrion Camp where he met

with a number of his Bulgarian friends and advised them that he had been

given a "charter and instructions", by certain members of

to form a committee of five members for the planning and execu-

tion of a fight for the liberation of Bulgaria. This committee, according

to DIMITROV, would be established in

and would cooperate with other

similar committees which have already been formed in France, Germany, and

other countries. The committee would later expand to 20 members and would

establish a so-called "Democratic Agrarian Bloc". Recruits would come from

among the members and sympathizers of the Bulgarian Democratic Party

(Moushynov) and from the Gichev Agrarians. Eligible Bulgarian emigres

would come to Greece

from Western Europe. to assist in the work, and pro-

minent members of the Gichev Agrarians and of the Democratic Party would

be assisted in escaping to Greece (presumably from Bulgaria) to join the

organization.

DIMITROV listed the organization's tasks as follows:

a. Intelligence activity in Bulgaria.

b. Organization of an underground resistance

movement in Bulgaria, and

C.

Organization of sabotage activity against

Bulgaria.

DIMITROV revealed that he was the president of the organization.

DIMIRTOV took frequent occasion

to mention that the

committee had its headquarters in

DIMITROV again visited the Lavrion Camp to inform his recruitsthat they

would shortly be moved to a pleasant hime in

which the Americans

were repainting for the purpose. On the occasion of this visit, the re-

cruits were divided into three groups, as follows:

a. a groupd of 10 men to specialize in intelligence;

•b.

a group of 6 men to be trained in radio in Germany

c. a group of. 15 men to specialize in sabotage.

The source of hhe information contained in the

DIMITROV as"an unprincipaled opportunist and Greek agent".

During this period of time, DIMITROV was the principal agent

in an ill-fated operation which resulted in a major expose and

trial in Sofia during 1951.

The agents used were those selec-

ted by DIMITROV, at least one of whom was pots probably an

operative of the Bulgarian Militia and acted as the betrayer

of his colleagues.

So one day. Iamkor ...(was).• told to go to the "Committee."

He was the

father of a Communist who probably had an important post in the

capital.

"We have missed you, lamkor, we see nothing of you."

"Oh, well, business you kaow."

"Why don't you com to the office of the People's Committee

so that we can sit and have a talk?"

"To the office? What would I be doing there?"

"Oh, having a talk."

"What do we have to talk about?"

Twell,"

as men and as fellow villagers we have mch to

talk about.

Fellow villagers? Tankov felt his blood boiling and

rising to his head. That expression "fellow villagers" struck

lis earg as an irony,

as an insult. he felt he was-being de

lled bi the mouth of that sordid murderer. because it wa

against these fellow villagers that his manda and extremism

had been directed and his fellow villagers had been killed on

his instructions; killed by the rabid mob of the Party during

its first onslaught. And among these fellow villagers whom

this jackal had killed there were his friends: the kind priest,

the teacher and the doctor, all those who were the heart and

mind of the village.

"Ilke fellow villagers?"

like friends.

I want to discuss something

with yony "It's necessary that" I should have a talk with you."

Yancho Yamkoy, who was descending the stairs without being

aware of this.

But the Russian organiser stopped him.

"No nonsense. This isn't the time for it. We shall

think over how and when and where it must be done."

And he did think about it.

A few days later Yankor was

found dead in a field outside the village.

He had beon

stabbed with wild ferocity.

Tinko and the militia made every effort to find the mr

derers. And they found then.

They were two peasants, two

stolid and incorrigible anti-Communists, who, aceording to

their own "confession', written and signed before the militia,

had committed the murder because they were informed that

Yankov had registered for participation in the kolkhos and

because he insistently and persistently had urged his fellow

villagers to join him.

The two murderers were taken away

for trial and never reappeared.

Yankora belongings, in accordance with a statement wieh

he had "gigned," were taken over by the kolkhot.

Here in Paris we finally have an Agrarian Union and we have

these letters: and am now again sending you one so that you can

Io In accordance with your instructions received through Mr. Donald F.

Ewing, CSE/2, and in coordination with Mr. Mahoney of WH Division, I flew to

DIROBALO, arriving there at noon on 26 May 1953, for the purpose of determining

whether subject has current operational information concerning SE operations

and personnel that would make him a security risk if he were allowed to re

settle within the next calendar year.

that KiLLY had been in detention until approximately 15 May when he was released

from confinement and allowed to attend classes and live with other persons who

are being prepared for resettlemente

Between 1300 and 1600 hours on 26 May, I reviewed the DIBOBALO Station

files on kathy and made an appointment with KilIl'g case officer to have a con

ference with KirLY at 0800 hourg 27 May. It was decided to use the affice of

the Station Security Officer for the meeting because of its inunerabillty to

other agents and to the laborers who vere working in the area.

The Security

Officer stated that the office would be made available for the time specifiedo

4o At 0800 hours 27 May KELLI's case officer escorted me to the pre

arranged meeting site and introduced me as Mike Vargas to KELLY who bad been

walting in the office. The case officer informed KELLY that I had arrived fran

Washington, D. C. to discuss his problems with him and would endeavor to resolve

all matters possible. KILLY appeared elated and in broken English said that he

was very happy to learn that the organization (I presume he meant CIA) finally

acknowledges him as a friendo. KITLY stated that he has been watting 25 months.

to speak to someone fron washington. The case officer departed from the room and

left KeLLY and me standing in the center of the roal. I asked KiLLI to be

seated and told bin that I speal Serbo Croatian and Inquired 1f he understood

Serbo Croatian, KEIY replied that he does speak Serbian and is glad that I

speak the language also becarise his Englist was not fluent and he has difficulty

expressing himself. All conversations hereafter were conducted in Serbo Croatian®

I opened the conversation by telling kault that his reports and letters

were received and studied very carefully at Washihgton and assured him that

pressing daties made it impossible for anyone to visit him at any time prior to

the present. KELLY replied that he folt relieved that he was not forgotten by

his Iriends and that he could now reveal everything that has been a puzzle to

him since his apprehension by the Greeks in 1951, and perhaps learn the causes

for certain actions that were directed against hin. KELLY stated that he was

imprisoned a few times and that he suffered terribly during those periods

because of his lability to withstand imprisoment.

In order that I might have a clear picture of his background and

initial contacts with the Americans In Sofia and later in Athens, as well as

his associations with other intelligence services in Bulgaria and Greece, KELLY

stated that he preferred to start from the begirning of his clandestine work in

Bulgaria and chronologically bring me up to date on his activities and ensuing

events. Since much of kuLLY's discussion is repeated in a report he had pre

vously prepared and which is in his files and since a great deal of the dis

cussion had no direct bearing on the purpose of the mission, I will for the sake

To According to KILLI, the highlights of his background and activities

are as followes When the Commnist regime gained control In Bulgaria he realized

the position the people of Bulgaria were placed in and that under Communism

the people were not going to be any better off than they were under the Fascists

or Nazis.

The only salvation for the Bulgarian people was for the Demoeratic

powers to achieve control and thereby extend their form of goverment to the

! Bulgarian people. He therefore proceeded to exploit Bulgaria with a vier to

organizing adherents into clandestine groups in order to werthrow the Commist

goverent that was in control. KeLLY stated that he had organized over 250

cells consisting of some 10,000 persons throughout bulgaria and Macedonia

According to KELLY, in 1945 he met the American General Crane in Sofia

and the Genersl requested KELLY to prepare a progran of his organization out

lining its mission, functions, etc.. Upon complying with this request KELLY

stated that General Crane informed him that his progran was very favorable and

that he (General Crano) desired KELLY to work for hin. KILLY said he agreed

and proceeded personally to exploit the cells of his organization in Bulgaria.

% In 1946 while KELLY was inspecting units of his organization in Bulgaria

i was arrested by the Coumnists and tried and found guilty on four counts an

imprisonede. According to KiLiT the only reason he was not given the deatl

sentence was because the. Commniats had hoped to use him as a vitness against

Nikola Petloy, Agrarian leader In Bulgaria who was also fomenting unreat among

the Agrarian factions. KilLI contimed by stating that he remained in prison

for approximately six months near Vratss where he was tortued by the police in

an effort to extract from him information on his organization and people with

whom he was assoctated, particularly Americans. KiII said he did not reveal

the information which the police desired.

10. Early in 1947 through members of his organization he was able to make

his escape from the prison.

He made his way to Sofia where he tried to contact

General Crane, but learned that General Crane was no longer in Sofia and that

is replacement was a Hr. Horne (probably John Horner, Chauge d'Affairs A•I.

of the Political Mission in Sofia:

Through the Mission secretary, Kind made

an appointment to see Mr. Horne and when he did meet him Mr. Horne told him

that he was not

that he was not arare of anything that had existed between KELLI and General

him.

11. KiLLI realizing that he was wanted in Bulgaria by the police for his

escape fron prison proceeded to work his way out of Bulgaria. He was assisted

by one Fancha Fernandova neur Plovdiv. On crossing the Bulgarian border into

Greece Kiny stated that he surrendered to a Greek patrol who immediately

channeled him through its interrogation center®

During this process KnITY said

he was approached by British Intelligence, a Mr. Andros (possibly Andrews) and

Mr. Scott, and was told that the British had heard of his organization and

wanted him to work for them. KiLLI refused the offer and told the British that

he preferred to work with the Americans. KETLY also said that the Greek IS

had asked him to work for them, and that he refused them also. He was then

placed in a refugee camp in Athens with other Bulgarian refugees.

12. In 1949 during KElLy's stay in the refugee camp he said that he learned

the art of making trinkets as a trade and was allowed to leave the refugee camp

and seek employment in a shop where he could contime his trade. He found a

shop that offered him a job and he accepted.. He stated that he had no intentiona

of making a livlihood in that occupation but it did give him an opportunity to

get out of the refugee camp and contime to seek means to combat the Communists

in Bulgarias

While on this job KELLY met a Greek woman by the name of Flora

Vavariou who said she had an aunt who lives in Chicago, Illinois. Since they both

wished to go to the United States; they decided to get married and, with an

affidavit of support fron Flora's Aunt, get visas to the U. S. Their next

move was to get to Italy through IRO channelse

13. KELLY claims that he did not know the Aunt's address or name other

than that she was referred to as Teresa.

KELLY said that he and Flora planned

to separate on reaching the United States.

According to KETLI, he checked with

the IRO In Athens and learned that because he was a Bulgarlan Immigrant he was

eLigible for emigration through IRO and since Flora had probable means of getting

him to the United States he decided to go through with the plan. He married

Flora in February 1949 and by the latter part of March they were en route to

Italye

Iho While In Italy KiLLY stated that Flora comnicated with her Aunt in

Chicago who was preparing to process the necessary affidavit for their entry

into the United States, Horever, during this period KiLLI learned that Flora

was pregnant and according to Italian Immigration officials she could not be

considered for emigration fron Italy until after the birth of her child. On

learning this, KiLI said his whole plan had collapsed and that he could not go

through with it. He decided toreturn to Athens and leave his wife with her

parents®

They returned to Athens In October 1949 A daughter was born in

November 1949e

15. Now that he had returned to Athens KELLY's intentions were to earn

sufficient funds ($2000) to build a home for his daughter. He was not con

cerned with flora as he had married her for the purpose of getting to the

United States.

The marriage was to be a temporary affair as they were not in

love with each other and had no intentions of remaining married.: Our information

shows that KiLly worked for the Propaganda Section of the Greek General Staff

headed by It. Colonel M. A. Alexandralds on his return to Athens. In order to

earn money kaunt decided to write several books on anti-Communis. since he

was not fluent in Greek be sought the assistance of a Greek scholar who could

translate his writings fran Bulgarian into Greek. KiLLI said he wrote two

texts and turned them over to a Greek educator to translates

16. In hugust 1950 KELLY decided to take his texts to the American Embassy

in Athens and inquire as to the possibility of having the texts translated into

English and published in the United States. He said he was directed to a Mre

Dining (probably Mr. Donald F. Ewing), Chief of Information Service, who in turn

Ictooduced him to a Mr. Willard Allan also an official at the American Embassy

In Athens. KiLY stated that after several meetings with Mr. Allan he was asked

by Mr. Allan to work with the Americans. Kotty Immediately volunteered and was

told in order to get an organization that could accomplish its mission he would

need several assistants

He explored the Layrion refugee camp for potential staff

personnel and was given the names of Ivan Hristonov and Ivan and Dimitur Doneve

Upon the suggestion of the Americans, Kill said he accepted the persons namede

He established a headquarters and proceeded planning operation to penetrate

Eulgariao Kill claimed the Greeks and certain Bulgarian emigre leaders in

Greece were opposed to his position with the Americans and did everything

possible to belittle his position and impair his operations The results of

KELLI's abortive missions into bulgaria are contained in a report which KHLY

prepared at DIROBALO and which is now in his file.

17 During the perlod in which he was trying to get his operations

nounted into Bulgaria, KELLY was approached by the French IS to work for them.

CLY statad that he immediately informed his American superiors regarding the

French approach and was thereafter directed by the Americans in his dealings

and associations with the Frerch IS®

KeLl. listed the following American personnel with whom he coordinated

all his activities: The Chief, name unknown to katY - probably Mr. MacLean,

Mr. Willard Allan, Miss Vera George (Mr. Allan's secretary), Mrs. Kingales

(connected with the Radio Station), Mr. George and Mr. Clef (training officers)•

KELLY referred to the following Bulgarian personnel as having been associated

with his organization and with whon he was acquainted: Ivan Hristonov, whom he

believes supplanted him in the organization in Athens; Ivan and Dimitur Donev,

whom he claims are presently in Argentina; Choyo. Stonovald (probably Stoyo

Chonovsic); Andon Andonov; Gospodin Gospodinov; Hristo Iraitov; Vasil, Janchev;

KELLy continued by stating that he was apprehended by the Greek Police,

allegedly for safe keeping in April 1951 He was placed in detention and re

mained under Greek control until his departure from Greece to Frankfurt by airo

From Frankfurt he was transported to Panana where he arrived on 5 Septenber 1951.

He was placed in detention at a hospital in Panana and was of the opinion that

perhaps the hespital was an exterminating establishment for undesirables. Later,

however, he said he learned otherwise and through a friend, Mr. Stanley, learned

that he was sent to Panama to undergo several physical check-ups and that after

that was completed he would be removed to an area some 50 miles away where he

would enjoy full freedom. Also that he would remain at his new location long

enough to learn a language and prepare himself for resettlement. When he in

quired how long that would be he was told that would be about air months.

20. In March 1952 KELLY was transferred to DTROBALO. He stated that he

remained at DTROBALO for six months and after that period he contronted the

authorities concerning his release and resettlement

Approximately one month

later KELIE said he informed the Station authorities that he would leave the

area if they did not release him as initially promised. He stated that he was

apprehended and placed in confinement until his rulease in May 1953.

21.. KiTTY advised that the above is a true account of his past ex

periences and in view of my limited stay in DTROBALO would appreciate any answer

I could give him regarding questions that have never been resolved and con

sequently have disturbed him.. KELLY apparently had a list of questions prepared

which he drew from a notebook and proceeded to read. the questions were as

follows:

do Why was he apprehended by the Greek Police?

Do Why was he placed in confinement in Panama and later at DIROBALO?

How much longer mst he remain at DIROBALO?

Is there any possibility of his worlong with the organization

(CIA) to complete the mission he initiated?

What happened to the texts he wrote that weretaken to the

United States by Mr. Willard Allan?

Why haven't any of his old friends visited him during the past

two years?

In regards to his fanily - KilLy stated that only as a last

resort and only if he had to remain at DIROBALO would he want his fanil

there. He would prefer working and saying sufficient money ($2000) to

purchase or build a home for them in Greece and drop the whole matter.

In respinse to the above questions. I told Kelly that:

He was apprehended by the Greek Police because of his proposed

negotiation with the French IS.

He was placed in confinement at Panama to undergo mental and

physical check ups to assure

his recovery from the ordeal which he had

undergone. His confinement at DTROBALO was to prevent his contemplated

and announced escape.

KELLY's stay at DTROBALO apparently is dependent on his quali

fications to meet resettlement requirements.

I told him I was not able to

judge when he had fulfilled those requirements.

There was also the task

Involved of finding

suitable positions for individuals with varied skills

KELLY was told that the people when he knew in Athens and Sofla

were no longer with the organization and therefore it was impossible for

to visit him.

I told KilLI that I did not know anything about his wife and child

other than the fact that KilLy was married and that his wife and child

resided in Athens.

I again queried KELLY concerning his wishes regarding

his family. Kalist asked how long It would take to bring the family to

South America if that were possible.. I replied that I had no definite

answere

KLY said that only if he knew he had to remain at. DIROBALO

Indefinitely would he request to have his wife and child with him

As I found KELLY to be a frail, nervous, alert,

and extremely talkative

person. During the twelve hour conference with KELLY I frequently interrupted

him to query him on persons and activities he referred to in his story only to

find bin replying briefly and persistently requesting to be allowed to continue

relating his thoughts and feelings.

Bo In relating his story of the organization he established and members

who comprised the organization KILLI appeared to have a clear and concise

picture of operations he directed and names and deseriptions of people with whom

he had come in contact?

Co It is my opinion that KeLLY knows little about operations in Greece.

I believe KELLY was so wrapped up in his on abortive missions and personnel

difficulties while in Greece that he paid littls, if any, attention to operations

that were running concurrentije

KILLY mentioned names of agents who are bing

currently used in Bulgarian operations; however, he referred to them as Bulgarlang

Do I feel confident that KiLLI realizes that his chances of resuming his

thing and that is to contact a former Greek companion (Mr. Karapides) who is a

this Division has reached the conclusion, based on facts set forth in the

folloing paragraphs, that Kelly, 1l released from confinenent; will be a

source of serious embarrasament to CIA.

3o: Subject, ADulgarian refugee in Greece, was the principal agent

in an 111-fatod operation run fron October 1950 to March 1951.

The

operation resulted in a major expose and trial in Sofia during 1951. The

agents used were those selected by Subject, at least one of whom was

• probably an operative of the Bulgarian Militia and acted as the betrayer

of his colleagues.

4 Subject's behavior during his employment was extraordinarily bad

and characterized by a complete lack of seourity and & conscious effort

on his part to aggrandize himself at the expense of the United States and

his fellow agentse unfortunately, duriche time of his use by us, he

acquired considerable information about CIA personnel, operations and

installations in Greece.

He was permitted to come and go freely in the certain

CIA offices in the American Embassy®

Through another iniorant the Athens station learned in early

1951 that Subject had contacted French Intelligence officers in Greece

and had agreed to sell complete details on U. Se plana for operations

against bulgaria for the sum of 16,000,000 drachmae. All subsequent

information on this transaction corroborates the veracity of the original

Informant's stery including a French document secured through another CIA

channel which shows that as early as 1949 Subject had been an agent of a

Embassy in Athense

6o At the urgent reguest of the Athens Station that Subject be

removed Immediately from Athens; arrangements were made for his trang

portation and incarceratton at DIROBALO. To facilitate his removal,

Subject was told that he was being taken to the United States for a

meeting of important satellite refugee leaders.

He was flown by CIA plane

to Germany, and fron there to Panama by U.S. Army plane.

The American case officer who handled him in Athens reported,

"Early In our relations with Kelly we foresaw the need to curb him or

eliminate him fran our operations. Since, however, he was necessary to

us, we tried to use him, restraining him and teaching him the while.

Kelly, unfortunately, did not learn - he got worse. He "borrored" and

stole noney fron many sources. He lied to many people, including us, and

he developed an Infantile megalomanta in which he persisted in considering

himself the forthcoming Minister President of Bulgaria,". During his detention

Incarcocation at DIROBALO, we understand that these same character traits

have been evident.

8o This Division believes that Subject's confinement should be

continued indesinitaly to preclude the probability that he would agair

try to

Goverments, or the press in order to capitalize on the information he

possesses concerning CIA, its operations against Bulgaria, the detaile

1,Financial Finagling in Greece

BULGARIAN

(a) In February, 1951, when Kelly was head of the Democratic Bloc,

three of his men arrived in Athens, coming directly from IRO camps.

They needed shelter, but had no money. They were put on salary, but it

was not enough to cover the sixmonths advance rent which it is the custom

o pay when a lease is made in Athens. Thus Kelly's advance account wa

credited with amt the amount of (danca) $850, which was to be used

to pay the rental advance. the three men were to pay it back in monthly.

installments.

Two such installments were paid by the nen when Kelly was "interned"

by our people. The men were then able to complain that Kelly had forced

then into quarters best described as "very Inadequate, insecurem and

unhealthy."

Comparing the quallty of the quarters with the amount advanced for

rent, lt becomes quite certain that Kelly made some sort of deal with the

landlord in order to make some money.

It should be kept in mind that Kelly forced three of his own countrymen

to live In these quarters, from which they were forthwith removed for

health and security reasons.

(b) Just prior to his removal, it was discovered that felly had a

cash shortage of over $100 which was not accounted for in any way When

an attempt was made to collect the money, it was discovered that Kelly

had spent it on himself.

2. Bunchpisinter Manuscript Episode

In December, 1950, Willard Allen, in accordance with a promise made

to Kelly, brought with him to this country three manuscripts, ostensibly

written by Kelly. Allen was to see what he could do to have these manu-

sripts published here. Kelly hoped to thus exploit and dramatize hie

escape from Bulgaria.

He was given, by us, & $300 advance on the publl-

cation of the manuscripts.

On December 14, 1951, In a conversation with Mr. Allen, It was learned

by us that Kelly had not written the manuscripts at all. Allen learned thie

himself when the real author wrote to him demanding the return of his

works.

The author said that he had a statement from Kelly disclaiming all

credit for the manuscripts. furthermore, the real author had seen nothing

of the $300 gluen to Kelly, although they apparently had agreed to go

50-50 on any profits realized from the publication of the manuscripte-

It is clear that Kelly lied to us, and used someone olse's Ilterary

talentsin the hope of galning noteriety and money himself.

• In early 1951, Kelly Informed our people in Athens that a french

Vice Consul from Salonica had contacted him in the hope of getting Kelly

to work ritudocare for his country. Kelly was allowed by us to contime

seeing this man until it was determineddjust what the French wanted in the

way of information. This point was reached, and Kelly was told not to see

his Frenchman or ady Frenchmen after & certain Thursday.

We know definitely

that Kelly saw saw his Frenchman on the following Friday, Saturday, and

Tuesday.

We do not know what was

said, but from a source whom we have no reason

to doubt, ( an ex-friend of Kelly's who deserted Kelly and came to us to

warn us of Ime the situation with the French) we learned that for a sum

amounting to 16,000,000 drachmae, Kelly had agreed to give the French the

names of all the American staffinvolved in plans to infiltrate Bulgaria,

mplus iaformation on Radlo faxtashion Gorianin. Kelly was immedlately

picked up by the Greek Allen Directorate, acting upon orders from Henry

McLean.

4. Reaction of Othera to Kelly

"Kolly was a notoriously insecure, disreputable, opportunistic

indinidual over wnom control, other than physical, was next to impossible

to

exercise....e had a positive genius for trouble naking intrigue,

rare even in this part of the world; his continued presence in Greece

would have rendered impossible any oillig of the stormy Bulgarian refugee

waters here. Kelly was tied in even more closuly than other Bulgarian

agents with the imbassy here, and could be counted on to use that fact,

modermot a matter of common knowledge in the Bulgarian colony, to

his own advantage and to the disadvantage of the best interests of U. s.

"overnment policy."

(b) Chief of station, OPC 1n Athens, lay 1951

"Kelly, unfortunately, is of an essentially irresponsible Irish

natare. Moreover, In his stupidity, he conceives all othere to be equally

stupid.

Early in our relations with folly,.. we foresaw the need to curb

Kelly or to eliminate him from our operations. since, however, he wau

still necessary: to us, we tried to use him, restraining him and teaching

him the while. Kelly, unfortunately, did not learn he got worse. He

"borrowed" and stole money from many sources. he lied to many people,

Including us, and he developed ay infantile megalomania in which he per-

sisted in considering hömself the forthcoming Minister President of

Bulgaria.

MEMORANDUM

TO:

FROM:

SUBJIBST:

Gerald I. Manfield

Terence U. Hasmith

Lyle 0. Kelly

It occurs to me, lying happily upon uy hepatitle bed as I am, that

some sort of a statement regarding the "demise" of Lyle 0. Kelly might

be in order "for the record". I shall diseuss two aspects of Kelly in

this memorandum, apologizing in advance for the vagueness of the dis

cussion which is due, I shall maintain, to my present horizontal position

far from records, calendars and the recollectionful clink of the Ismailie

gold pound.

1. The good of Lyle O. Kelly.

In the summer of 1950 Stair was in the ridiculous position of

being unable to do anything because the alien support on which it de

pended; allegedly forthcoming from the reverend Dr. Glantz, was not

forthconing.

In a bit of a

tizzy, anxious to get cracking, we picked

up Lyle 0. Kelly. We suspected at the time that he was not the new

"white hope",

but we needed someone through whom we could obtain bodies.

We obtained bodies through Kelly and actually have accomplished some

substantive work.

Thus it must be remembered that Kelly performed a

useful service for is.

2. The bad of Lyle O, Kelly.

Kelly, unfortunately, is of an essentially Irresponsible

Irish nature®

Moreover, in his stupidity, he conceives all others to

be equally stupid.

Early in our relations with kelly, before I left

ICDrink in October, we foresaw the need to curb Kelly or to eliminate

aim from our operations.

Since, however, he was still necessary to as,

we tried to use him, restraining bin and

teaching him the while.

Kelly, unfortunately, did not learn - he got worse. He "bor-

rowed" and stole money from many sources. He lied to many people, in-

cluding us, and he developed an infantile megalomania in which he per-

sisted in considering himself the forthcoming Minister-President of

Dreamland.

Things took a serious turn when Kelly's coumittee, men he

himself had chosen, came to us behind his back complaining about him.

This became nore serious when his "closest" friend, & Flake, the man

who had actually written the books for which Kelly took credit, de

serted Kelly and came to us apparently in an honest desire to safe

guard America and the struggle against Commnism from further involve-

ment-with a character as shady as Kelly.

The most serdous matter, one which could not be ignored, in-

volved Kelly's relations with the FBFairies.

Kelly had advised us that

a Fairy Vice Consul from Salonica had contacted him with regard to work-

Ing together. We told Kelly he might go ahead and contime his relation

with this gentleman until we learned exactly what the gentleman wanted.

We learned what was wanted and advised felly he was not repeat not to see

the Fairy agent, of any other Fairies, after a certain Thursday. We know

definitely that Kelly did see this Fairy on the following Friday, Satur

day, and Tuesday.

We do not noy what he discussed with the Fairy but we have no

reason to doubt the word of his Flake friend which is essentially as

follows:

That the Fairies were interested primarily in the

names and numbers of all the players (as, that 1s) 1n

plans for Infiltration of Dreanland, In information on

Radlo Goriants, ete.; that Kelly had agreed to sell

this information to the Fairies for a sun of 16,000,000

drachmae and that he had an appointment to complete the

transaction at 1l o'clock the following morning-

On this information we had Kelly picked up, and are now troubled with

the question of disposing of him.

Since that time we have examined more closely into the elly

ffair and have found more lies, more secret agreements, more store

runds, more of that good, Irish whimsicality for which Kelly Is alread

so famous. (Note that even if the hearsay evidence regarding the sell-

out to the Fairies is erroneous - although it is backed by several in

dependent bits of substantial evidence - we still have enough proof of

untrustworthiness to have a compete case against Kelly.) We cannot

continue with kelly. He is finished.

(It is pertinent to note that Kelly's connittee, and his party

in general, feel no feeling of loss since his removal from active politics.

Not a single person has asked about him except his wife - whome he con

tinuously disowned - who wanted only to know how she might get in touch

with him to ask him for some money.

The committee and refugees in

Iflake in general, are in much better spirits than they have ever been

before. Kelly's removal is in every way a tonic.)

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Development of the Rift with DIMITRI. A. DIMITROV

1. Biography: (See 104 CAGNU, dated 4 October 1950) Born 7 May

192k in Medkovets, Bulgaria.

Education-studied philology for one year

at Sofia University, 1942-43. In 1942 joined secret branch of the

Bulgarian National Agrarian Union. Claims to have begun underground,.

anti-Fascist activities in 1943 in Macedonia and to have worked closely

with Dr. G. Mo Dimitrov during this time. After emerging briefly from

hiding in September 1944, he again went underground engaging in anti-

communist activities, touring various cities and toms,

(Including

sections of Yugoslav Macedonia) and urging members of the Agrarian party

to take positive action against the Communists. In October, 1940, he

was arrested by the police.. He believes the reason he was not executed

ins that the Comminists wished to use him as witness against Nikola

Petkov.

On 23. July 1947 he escaped to Greece.

2. Initial operation: (See Athe 3200 (IN 46672), 25 October 1950)

In Oetober, 1950, the OKSTAIR Field Chief learned of Dimitret through

the local peripheral reporting officer and contacted him covertly.

Dimitrov made six agents Immediately avallable for infiltration operations.

Three of these sir were successfully infiltrated on 10 December, carrying

leaflete signed: in the name of the Bulgarian Democratic Bloe, the emigre

political group organized and headed by Dimitrov.

3. Subsequent activities: Dimitrov has supplied an additional 21

agents for OKSTAIR infiltration operations, 15 of whom have just com

pleted training in Germany and are being prepared for infiltration by

mid hay

4. Origine of OSTAIR break with Dimitrov:

a. In Athe 4821, IN 30224, Manfield reported on 22 March that -

he was considering breaking off association with Dimitroy because

he had become too unpopular and dictatorial and self-important.

There were also indications of gerious misappropriation of funds.

Manfield felt that Dimitrov's group could continue to be utilized

under the leadership of Ivan Doner Ivanov.

b. In Athe 5150 (IN 36130) dated 20 April 1951, Manfield

cabled that he had had the Greek Aliens Directorate pick up Dimitrov

and put him under protective arrest for the reasons indicated above

and because Dimitrov was about to gell out to the French. (Mis

was discovered through an OPC penetration of Dimitrov's organization.)

He also requested instructions on how to

dispose of Dimitrov for

• period

of three months, which he felt was sufficient time in

which to render him harmless to STAIR operationa.

As a result of discussions between WHD, SE, CFI, and DD/A, It was

decided to send an SE representative to DIROBALO to Intervien Lyle O, KELIY

for the purpose of determining whether he represented sufficient security hazard

to current SE operations out of Greece to warrant his being retained in maxim

detention®

In accordance with this agreement, Major Michael A. Hemovich was sent

to DIBOBALO where he arrived at noon on 26 May 1953.

Major Hemovich discussed the case with the case officers concerned

at DIROBALO, and then spent twelve hours talling to KELLI.

As a result of

this, it has been ascertained to our satisfaction that KilLY does not appear to

have information of sufficient eurreney regarding staff or agent personnel, Or

current operations, in Greece to make his resettlement within the course of the

next twelve months a serious security riake

4o We therefore recamend that Lyle O. Kault be given whatever training

in language and trade Wl Division feels 18 required, and that efforts then be

made to resettle hin in South America. Our only request is that this Division

be kept informed of the progress of this rehabilitation and be advised of the

steps taken to resettle Kill.

In this connection it should be polated out

that KELI,, has a wife and child in Greece.

When queried by Major Hemovich

about them, he profesed no interest in having the wife or child Join hing

stating that he would like to provide sone money for the support of the child

11 and when he got a job and could put aside sone money for this purpose. It

1s therefore our intention to have KELIT write his wife a letter telling her

MEMORANDUM

SUBJICT. Dinitar Adamov DIMITROV ala "Dito" DIMITROV

1. A reviow of Agency filon revenls the following data concerning Subject

and his association with CIA.

2. Subject was first contacted in October 1950 by the Field Chiaf of OPC

activities in Athens, Greece. The purpose of this contact was to assest

Subjues as a principal agent and focal point in the recruitment of Bulgarians

to participate in OPC operation directed against Buigarta. For this parpose..

an organization called the Democratie Bloe was established, and Subject was

placed as its ostenaible organiner and chief.

3. During the perted October 1950 through March 195l, Subject remalsed

in the employ of OPC in Atheas and provided 21 agenta for infiltration into

Bulgarta, but he never participated in the cross-border operations.

4. In early 1951, various operational and adminiatrative dufleuities

began to manifest themselves and it was docided that Subjoct should be

removed from hia position. In April 1951 it came to OPC's attention that

Subject intended to sell his knowledge of CIA's activities to the French

Istelligence Service. This fact was used as the primary reason for his

removal from active participation in Balgarian operation.

5, Becauso of operational secarity considerations stemming from his

duplicity and personal make-up, it was deemed inadviaable to leave Subjeet

at large in Greece and it was decided that he should be transfarred to a CIA

holding facility.at Fort Claytos, Panama, He was airlifted from Athens to

Frankfurt where he was hopitalized four days for observation, and then

flown black to Fort Claytos, arriving on 4 September 195l. He remained

there until January 1954.

6. A CIA case officer was dipatched from headquarters in May 1953

to Fort Clayton where he interrogated Subject. It was determined at that

time that whatever operational knowledge Subject had of CIA, it methods.

personnel, and operations was obsolete.

## Page 135

13-00000

7. With termination of the holding facility at Fort Clayton, Subject

was temporarily reroved to Greece since there were no other immediate

posnibilition to resettle him. (The attached undezstanding with Subject

was effected o/a 12 January 1954 at the time ol his removal from Fost

Clayton.) CIA made a commitment to the Greek authoritice that CiA

would not abandon Subject in Creece and would inke step. to remove him

from Greek soil within enn year.: Elforta were made to effact Subject's

migration to Chands, Nov Zenland, Australia and alnewbaro, but to no

avail, Altur dus connideration by inturosted hondguarters olements and

the Athens Station, it was doetded that the bem eflective solution for

Subjees' a disposal would be to let him immigrate to the United States on

his own under the Refuge Bolial Act programa, bus without any asntatance

trom OlA:

8... Since arrival in the United States, Subject hmm come to our attintien

on the following occasion:

On 14 May 1957, the Dapartzent al State informed CIA that

Subjoct had contacted theis office and tried to Interest them la

purchaning a fenture longth film script. At tart tie Subject told

the Depariment of State that he was living is Newark, New Jersey.

with his wife and seven-year-old daughter and was in Washington

on a violt. The State Department had no interest to the film script

and asked 1 members of this Agency would like to meet Subject and

discans the script. This offer was turned dow. The cass offleer

involved understood that State Department then discontinued all

contact with Subject. There la no further information available.

9. Although ho was connidered to be of operational vuive at the time ho

was originally picked up by elementa al CIA, Subject's aubroquent actions,.

lach of integrity and poor security indicated that he wan unworthy of any

•further operational consideration. He hae a tendensy to exagerate to the

point of lylag and become involved is deals of which he was the financial

benefactor,

Throughout all his deals, howover, there in the thread of alleged

national pride and desire to project himmell in the fight againat Conmanium.

There have been reported rumors of bis having been a Bulgaria: S agent

even during the time when he was employed by CIA. No concrete evidence.

however, was actually uncovered to subatantiate there allegations, which

are believed to be typical of desunciatione made by rival polliical factiona

among emigres.

10. An the result of the sovlow ol Subject's ento, it in recommended

that nothing further be done for him since he dous not porenis any demaging

information concuring current operation and his memory of pint operationa

and personalities is between nine and ten yeara old... (I view of the circura-

stances of terminatios, It should be pointed out to Subject that le preacing
