V. 157-10673-802 p. 70 1s a xeroxed copy of the

registration card for "JOE PARISH" at the Provincial Motel

as set forth on page 84 of the report of SA ALBERT E. MILLER

dated 11/27/68 at New Orleans.

The indices of the New Orleans Office contain no

other references relating to anyone by the name of "JOE PARISH."

For the information of the Bureau because "JOE PARISH"

was unable to be identified and located, it appears possible

that this is a fictitious name used by a male to rent a room

for a "1-nite stand."

The name "JOE PARISH" would be used in

a similar manner as

the name "JOE SMITH" is

used in other

of the country on motel and hotel registration cards.

being noted that the name PARISH is commonly used in

this area as, all 64 counties in the state of Louisiana are

referred to

as a Parish, ie. Orleans Parish,

Jefferson Parish, St. James Parish,

St. John the Baptist Parish,

and so forth.

Mr. DEMPSEY was informed that the FBI was not

conducting such

an investigation.

He was furnished with the name of ROBERT BURAS

who has been associated with the NOPD in that BURAS was

employed by captioned committee to handle some of the

investigation. He was also furnished with the name of

a former NOPD officer by the name of L. J. DELSEA.

DEMPSEY stated that he knew both individuals and he

expressed his sincere appreciation for the above informa-

tion.

Peter G. Beeson, Mark A. Speiser, and Lisa Berlow, Staff

Counsel

of the HSCA.

:

The questioning related to the investigation

conducted by the New Orleans Office of the FBI regarding the

assassination of Martin Luther King.

In response to their initial questions, they were

informed that SA Callendes has been a Special Agent of the

FBI since August, 1951 and that he has been assigned to the

New Orleans FBI Óffice since December, 1961.

ON ASSASSINATIONS

In addition, the Staff Counsel was provided with administrative

data relating to the normal procedures in opening and

assigning a case as well as the handling of leads and

reporting procedures and

the closing of cases.

In response to their questions, they were informed

that SA Callender had not reviewed the Martin Luther King

assassination file in New Orleans prior to this interview

and had not conversed with anyone regarding the interview

before the "Staff Counsel", other than with a Bureau official,

on December 6, 1977 prior to the interview.

They were informed that the last time SA Callender

had thoroughly reviewed the King

assassination file in New

Orleans was possibly eight or nine years ago.

There would

have been no reason since that time to thoroughly review this

file,

that

within the past six months, small portions of

the New Orleans file had been reviewed

to locate specific

King in the investigation conducted by New Örleans.

The Staff Counsel initially pointed out that there

Upon response to questions., SA Callender

informed

that to the best of his recollection, former District Attorney

Jim Garrison of Orleans Parish, New Orleans, had not

conducted an investigation into the assassination of King,

that instructions had been received from Bureau Headquarters

not to have any contact with farrison prior to the King

assassination.

This probably was a result of Garrison's

claims that his investigation into the assassination of President

Kennedy had determined there was a conspiracy and the results

of his investigation were at odds with the conclusions of the

Warren Commission.

It was SA Callender's récollection that

that the reason Courtney was referred to the District Attorney's

Office at Memphis was not recalled, but possibly was because

that agency had a primary jurisdiction in the murder of

King.

It has been SA Callender's experience that the

Bureau's policy in dealing with the press in those days was

formulated at Washington, D.C. and for the most part,

controlled from Bureau Headquarters and especially in

matter involving the magnitude of the king investigation.

They indicated they had received information that a person

with the first name of Kent (last name unknown) attended

a Ku Klux Klan function at Alexandria, Louisiana and were

informed that to the best of SA Callender's recollection,

Kent courtney had not ever been identified as a Klan member.

In response to their questions, they were informed that

Klar groups active in Louisiana at the time of the King

assassination were the Original Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.

the United. Klans of America, and the Original Knights of

the Ku Klux Kiăn of the 6th

District.

The Silver Dollar

Group was a Klan type organization around the Vidalia-

Ferriday, Louisina, area.

It was not recalled if this group

was associated with the UKA or the Minutemenn or was à ..

separate organization.

No information had been developed regarding

possible involvement of organized crime in this matter.

The name of Frank Liberto was not familiar at this time..

It was recalled by SA Callender that there had been a.

conversation

between two men in Memphis who were in the

produce business which apparently was derogatory in

nature regarding King: As a result, an interview had

been conducted of an individual in New Orleans who was

in the produce business.

That investigation to identify the New Orleans

Italian Industrialist who reportedly was to give Ray

money which information was furnished by Charles Stein

had been conducted, however, the extent of the investigation

was not recalled.

Investigation had been conducted in the

area of the Chef

Menteur Highway, however, the extent was

not recalled.

That Willard Robertson was

at that time a

distributor for Volkswagen, which was located near the

Chef Menteur Highway. It was believed Robertson had

been interviewed, however, the results could not be

recalled.

That attempts were made to identify "Raoul"

however the extent was not recalled. That a lieutenant

on the Louisiana State Police Force by the first name of

Raoul had been

located and interviewed; however, the results

of the interview were not recalled.

To the best of SA Callender's recollection, the

John Birch Society and White Citizens Council, had not been

investigated in connection with the King assassination

and in fact, neither of these groups had ever been

investigated by the FBI in Louisiana.

It could not be

recalled li investigation was conducted at the Wallace

Campaign Headquarters in New Orleans to determine if Ray

was kriown, however, it was believed that this investigation

had been conducted.

That bars in the 400 and

500 block of Canal Street

in New Orleans had been canvassed inasmuch as Ray reportedly

was seen in this area when in New Orleans.

to various organizations and that in the past, Klan meetings

have been held at this meeting hail.

A group known as "Truth or Consequences" was

Iormed by New Orleans businessmen to raise

money for

Jim Garrison to conduct his investigation into the

Kennedy assassination.

That Cecil Shilstone is a self-employed New

Orleans businessman who had been publicly identified as

a member of Truth or Consequences.

Sometime after the

assassination of king, Shilstone and his attorney

appeared at the New Orleans Office and informed that à rumor

was going around the New Orleans business community

that Shilstone allegedly was a New Orleans industrialist

who Ray reportedly came to New Orleans to contact and

get money.

That Shilstone emphatically denied this

allegation and that he was not involved in any manner

or could he supply ty informactor relating to the

King assassination.

That all informants and sources in the New

Orleans Division were contacted regarding James Earl

Ray in an effort to determine if Ray was known or had

any association with any white hate groups or black

extremist organization.

That it could not be recalled what investigation

may have been conducted at Denham Springs, Louisiana,

regarding a remark allegedly made sometime prior to the

assassination that a collection ought to be taken up to

get somebody to shoot King.

To. SA Callender's recollection, there was no

racial prejudice among agents assigned to

the New Orleans

Office and that there

was no negro agents

assigned to this

office at the time of the King investigation.

In addition,

the "Staff Counsel" mentioned several names of persons,

however, these names mentioned were not faniliar to SA

Callender at this time.

except

prominent gambling figures like Sam Diviazza, who was

convicted by the New Orleans Division during

Agent was asked specifically for a chart of the

organized crime figures in louisiana would have a ulterior
