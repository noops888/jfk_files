AMWHIP/2 was told that we should like to maintain contact

with him after BUNCE leaves lone, but that the person who would be

basis - 1.o., that be in unpald, that his cooperation is voluntary,

and that he will not be required to engage in activity which could

endanger his security or business.) The second condition was that.
