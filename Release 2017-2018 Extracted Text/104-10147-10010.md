OLG # 79-6 205

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

This responds in full to a December 18,

1978, letter to the Attorney General signed by G. Robert

Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director, HSCA, which asked

that the FBI declassify, in toto, a Secret, September

1978, response made to 16 interrogatories pertaining a,

Ivanovich Nosenko which were propounded by the

Committee in its letter of September 5, 1978.

Declassification of the September 14, 1978,

response required coordination with the Office of Legis

Lative Counsel, CIA, which interposed no objection to

declassifying certain portions of that response.

The Committee's attention is invited to the

fact that CIA did suggest, with regard to the response

to interrogatory number "g", that the FBI "... may wish

to correct the dates on which the FBI did not have direct

access to Mr. Nosenko, to read 3 April 1964 until 8 December

1968."

For the convenience of the Committee, the

following declassified, verbatim reiteration of the

September 14, 1978, response is provided.

This responds in full to the following enumerated

interrogatories submitted for consideration in a letter,

and signed

"I. On what dates and for ho: long was Nosenko

questioned by the FBI about Lee Harvey Oswald

from 1964 to present?"

The files of the FBI indicate that Yuri Ivanovich

Nosenko was interviewed regarding Oswald and/oï the assassi-

topical discussions, of those five interviows; however.

sunmary communications indicate the February 27, 1964 inter-

view was conducted on the afternoon of that date and the

March 4, 1964 discussion of Oswald occurred at the outset

of an afternoon intorvier on that date.

42. When Nosenko was questioned by the [BI about

Lee Harvey Oswald, who did the questioning?"

The FBI interviews of Nosenko, during which he was

questioned about Oswald and/or. the assassination of President

Kennedy, were conducted by Special Agents (SAs) Alekso

Poptanich, Maurice A. Taylor and Donald E. Walter on

February 26 and 27, 1964; by SAs Poptanich and W. Maivin

Gheesling on March

3 and 4, 1954; and by SAs Poptanich,

Taylor and Walter on March 6, 1964.

13. What background, if any, did the interro

gator have in interrogations? What knowledge

did the interrogator have with respect to Oswald's

wear

background?"

There are no retrievable FBI statistics upon which

to base a quantification of the interrogatory experiences of

the SA personnel who interviewed Nosenko on the five pertinent

occasions.

suftice it to say, the techniques of cooperative

and hostile interrogations are integral aspects of the training

and aluost daily duties of SA personnel:

is noted that during the February and March, 1964 interviews

SA Poptanich had almost 13 years of SA experience; SA Taylor

had over 31 years of SA experience; SA Walter

had completca

almost 17 years of SA experience; and SA Gheesling had over

13 years of SA experience.

Further, their respective personnel

files disclose the following:

SA Poptanich was then fluent in the Russian language

(Nosenko's native tongue).

The Annual

Report of Perfornance

Rating, dated March 31, 1962, noted that SA Poptanich, during

the previous twelve nonths, had participated in the interro

gation of a soviet defector and his knowledge of the Russian

language and mores of the Russian people proved most helpful

relative thereto.

SA Taylor, on September 1l, 1962, received an incen-

award in recognition of the superior

fashion his responsi-

bilities were discharged over an extended period of time.

Special Agent in Chaige (SAC) of the Washington Field Office,

in submitting a recommendation for the incentive award,

connented that SA Taylor had demonstrated exceptional ability

in the interrogation and debricfing of three Soviet defectors,

all of whom were intelligence officers.

SA Taylor's Perfor-

mance Rating for the period April 1, 1963--March 31, 1964,

noted he was recognized as the finest interrogator on the

Soviet espionage squad in the Washington Field Office, which

accounted for his assignments

; to interview Soviet defectors.

SA Walter was the recipient of a personal letter of

on has sue, da a oct th had in of a he receive,

case,

successful interrogation being the key aspect of that

investigation.

SA Gheesling, at the time of the pertinent Nosenko

interviews, served as a Supervisor at FBI Headquarters and

had considerable experience in espionage, intelligence and

counterintelligence investigations.

SA Gheesling supervised

the field investigation of Oswald (from the latter's return to

the United States on June 13, 1962 until September, 1902, and

from November 22, 1963 through mid-1964). He was assigned

exclusively to supervisory responsibilities iclative to the

assassination of President Kennedy®

While the specific knowledge of Oswald's background,

possessed by these SAs at the time of the Nosenko interviews,

can be answered only by the SAs themselves, SA Gheesling's

prior assignent to supervision of the Oswald investigation

would tend to indicate that he,

at least, was quite knowledge-

able of

data contained in FBI files concerning Oswald.

"4. On the dates that Nosenko was questioned about

Ostiald, does there nois exist or did there ever exist:

a. a tape of the questions asked and Nosenko's

answers

b. a transcript of the questions asked and

Nosenko's answers;

c. a summary of the questions asced and.

Nesenko's enswers?"

As noted in FBI menorandum dated June 19, 1979,

captioned as above,

and which was prepared in response to HSCA

letter, dated June 13, 1978, to the Attorney General, FBI

records searches have

not located any extant tape recordings

o1 verbatin transcripts of FBI interviews with Nosenko that

concerned Oswald and/or the assassination of President Kennedy.

A docmient has been located which indicates that FBI personnel

did record the February 36 and 27, 1954, interviews of Nosenko,

among others. Since no recordings or transcripts have been

located, it can be assumed that the recordings were used by

the interviewing SAs to check the accuracy of their notos

prior to dictating the results of the interviews.

It is

further assumed that, upon verifying the accuracy of

sunnary

reportings of the interviews, the recordings were disposed of

since they had served the purpose for which they were made,

although no record of such.

disposition can be found.

Sunnary

reportings of the five pertinent interviers are extant, and

were delivered to the HSCA on March 21, 1978.

55. What criteria, if any, as used to determine:

a. what subjects to question Nosenko about;

b. how much time to devote to each subject!"

FBI files do not contain a specific enumeration of

criteria used to determine the particular subjects Noseako

was to be questioned about nor the amount of time to be devoted

to each subject in the questioning.

"6.

What significance — with respect to possible

foreign involvement in the assassination as cell

as to the issue of Nosenko's bonafides (sic) did

the FBI attach during the years 1961-1968 to Nosenko's

statements about Oswald?'

The FBI, during the years 1964-1968, considered

Nosenko's statements about Oswald to be very significant elements

of his initial reportings, the veracity of which nad to be

assessed in relation to the totality of information furnished

by him.

The FBI perceived Nosenko's statements about Oswald,

depending upon

a subsequent, definitive resolution of Nosenko's

bona rides,

to be the most authoritative information available

indicative of a lack of Soviet goveramental involvement in the

assassination of President Kennedy.

87. What significances - with respect to possible

foreign involvement in the assassination as well as

to the issue of Nosenko's bonafides (sic)-does

the FBI attach today to Nosenko's statements about

Oswald?"

The FBI does no perceive any significant evidence of

foreign involvement in the assassination of President Kennedy,

nor does the FBI perceive any credible evidence that Nosenko's

defection was a Soviet ploy to mask Soviet governmental

involvement in the assassination.

Therefore, the fil is

satisfied that Nosenko reported the facts about Oswald as he

knew them.

ng. If the answer to question 6 is different from

the response to question 7, when did the change

occur and why?"

The FBI had no direct access to Nosenko from

April 3, 1964 until April S,

1959, and therefore was not in

a position to make an objective assessment of his bona fides

nor of the veracity of information furnished by him.

Thus,

infornation provided by him, in early 1904, was accepted at

face value and qualified in

terms of the source and the

conditions under which it was reccived. On October 1, 1958,

the FBI advised the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that,

based upon a review of material provided by CIA, the FBI

found no substantial basis to conclude that Nosenko was not

a bona fide defector; however, the FBI

did not reach any

overall, definitive conclusions regarding his bona fides

because of a lack of access to Nosenko and all collateral

totality of information furnished by him.

F9. What was the FBI's position from 1964 to

1988 on the question of whether Nosenko is

bonafide (sic)?"

## Page 8

House Select Committee on Assassinations

The FBI, from 1904 to 1968, characterized Nosenko

aS

a

Soviet defector whose bona fides had not been established.

"10. What is the FBI's position today on the

question of whether Nosenko is bonafide (sic)?"

The FBI currently characterizes Hosenko as a former

Soviet Committee for State Security (KGB) officer who has

furnished reliable information in the past, and considers

Nosenko to be a bona fide Soviet defector.

"I. If the ansier to question 2 is different from

the response to question 10, when did the chenge

occur and why?"

The answer to question 8 is considered responsive

to question 11.

*I2. What sas the PBI's position from 1964 to

1968 on whether Nosenko was telling the truth in

the statements he made to the FBI about Oswald?"

The FBI did not take a position, from 1964 to 1908,

on Whether Nosenko was telling the truth in the statements

he made to the FBI about Oswald. The statements were accepted

at face value and qualified in terms of the source and the

conditions under which they were received.

#13. What is the FBI's position today as to

whether Nosenko was telling the truth in the

statements he made to the FBI about Oswald?"

The FBI is satisfied that Nosenko truthfully

reported the facts about Oswald as he knew them.

"I4. If the answer to question 12 is different

from the response to question 13, when dd the

change occur and why?"

As indicated in the responses to questions, and &

the FBl, as of October 1, 1968, found no substantial basis to

¿ conclude Nosenko was not a bona fide defector; as of May 11,

1977, accepted a CIA assessment that Nosenko was a bona fide

derector; and has not perceived any significant evidence,

from 196% to date, that Nosenko reported other than the faces

about Oswald as he knew them.

"15. Did either the FBI or the CIA have primery

responsibility for investigating Nosenko's state

ments about Oswald? If neither had primery

responsibility, was there any division of

responsibility?"

The FBI had primary responsibility for investigating

Nosenko's statements about Oswald that pertained to his

(Oswald's) activities in the United States, including the

assassination of President Kennedy. The CIA had primary

responsibility for investigating Nosenko's statements adout

Oswald's activities abroad.

"16. What communication, if any, existed betiresn

the FBI and CIA with respect to evaluating end/or

investigating Nosenko's statements about Oswald?"

The FBI forwarded a letter, dated March 6, 1964,

from

the Director, FBI, to the Director, CIA, enclosing

memoranda dated february 28, 1964, and March

4, 1964, cap-

tioned "Lee Harvey Oswald,"

which summarized the results of

FBI interviews of Nosenko regarding Oswald on February 26

and Li, 1904, and March 3 and 4, 1964.

The results of a CIA

interview of Nosenko on January 23, 1964, regarding Oswald

were furnished to the FBI in a letter from the CIA dated

AprIl 28, 1994.

These particular pieces of correspondence,

while not setting fortn any specific requests or investiga-

tive leads, were furnished for purposes of evaluation.

Where information is not piovided, it is either

not retrievable fron FBI Headquarters files or is not being

furnished pursuant to the Memorandun of Understanding.
