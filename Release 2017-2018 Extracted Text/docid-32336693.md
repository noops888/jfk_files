SECRE

Reference is made to your memorandum dated October 2, 1963, con-

Aries Linded

cerning information previously furnished to the Department indicating

that Eloy Cutierrez Menoyo, an SNIE official, was a "registered Army source.

You advised by the memorandum of October 2, 1963 that in checking with

Army intelligence in Miami on September 24, 1963, concerning Its current

interest in him, Army Intelligence advised that it no longer maintained

a relationship with Gutierrez and that it had no information concerning

a proposed plan to infiltrate a group of guerrillas into Cuba by use of

an airplane. You further advised in your memorandum of October 2, 1963,

NWR

that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Miami, advised on September

1963 that it had no operational interest in Gutierrez' proposed plan.

Accordingly, I believe you vill be interested in infornation which

was brought to our attention during a conference on January 6, 1964 between

1961

representatives of my Division (Foreign Agents Registration Section) and

representatives of Army Intelligence at the Pentagon (Office of Lieutenant

Colonel Rolfe, Chief of Collections Division), on matters relating to

the SNFE-Alpha 66. As you know, we have solicited the registration of

this organization pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign Agents Regis-

tration Act, and in view of their non-compliance, we had been considering

the possibility of a grand jury. At the conference, however, we learned

that Army Intelligence had under consideration a plan which was then pending

final approval by a high level Department of Defense authority, to use

Antonio

• Veciana, Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo and Nazario Sargen, all SNE-Alpha 56

leaders, as sources for the collection of intelligence.

It was particularly

pointed out that Army Intelligence was

interested in 'individuals' as

opposed to their organization.

The Army Intelligence representatives also

advised us that Gutierrez Menoyo is now a "registered Army source" in the

Intelligence source registry maintained by the Central Intelligence Agency

• (GIA):

Further, I wish to advise that this Division on January 14, 196

was telephonically advised by a Major Fer? & 220, of the Army Intelligence

representatives attending the January 6th conference with this Division,

that their plan had been approved and that Army Intelligence would be

using Veciana, Gutierrez Menoyo and Sargen for Intelligence purposes.

In view of the above, we do not plan to convene a grand jury

on this matter at this time.

This is for your information and should be considered as sensitive

intelligence information.
