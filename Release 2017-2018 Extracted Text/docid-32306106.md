Within the past month or so seven numbers runners

have been robbed and beaten up.

No newspaper, publicity

the victims did not file complaints with

the Newark, NJPD.

Informant said some numbers operators are paying

off as high as $200 per week to the Black Muslims for

"protection".

This shakedown is being tolerated because th

ICN figures behind the scenes are afraid of retaliation

through murder of some of the Black Muslims may set off

a race riot.

would further interfere with

the numbers

business; cause

This, in cura local, state and possibly Federal

investigations into

the causes of

the riot; and, as importantly,

embarrass

the politicians,

Informant said the LCN is aware ol this situation,

but is leaving the individual numbers operator to get

along as best he can.

The individual operator, not having

an "Army" to retaliate, is therefore complying

with the

shakedown requests.

The situat_on, however,

is groving worse because

the Black Muslims, feeling the ICN is bowing to their

demands, are making greater demands for "protection money".

When the interference and demands become non-manageable,

the individual operators will either be forced out or the

ICN will step in with the necessary incce to correct the

situation.

Informant feels the Black Muslins are using

Mafia tactics

"Army" and secrecy.

He said the LCN

does not relish the idea of doing combat with the Black

Muslims.

NK 2327-PC denied his numbers operation was

experiencing trouble.

When asked what specific reaction a

mob boss would have should informant relate the above

problem, intormant said the boss would listen attentively,

"You know what has to be done".

This evasion

of the problem leaves the individual numbers operator only

the choice of paying the shakedown price because he is in

no position to do battle,
