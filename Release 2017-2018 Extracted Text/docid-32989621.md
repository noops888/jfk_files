or strong arm tactics to achieve their objectives.

As these

groups of individuals were identified, investigations were

initinted on an individual basis. There has been no list

or indices maintained by this Bureau on "Action Groups" as

such.

(6)

The Security Index (SI) of the FBI predates passage

of the Internal Security Act of 1950, which legislation

contained the Emergency Detention Act (EDA),

A residential

Directive dated September 6, 1939, provided

that the FBI

take charge of investigations in matters rolating to espionage,

sabotage, subversive activities and violation of the neutrality

regulations.

Tollowing this Directive, a "Suspect List" was

compiled at FBIHQ in Novembex, 1939, as an inteinal administrative

aid.

Individuals included on this list consisted of primarily

large factions, those having Nazi sympathies and those having

communist sympathies, and whose liberty during time of a national

crisis tould constitute a nenance to the public peace and internal

sccurity of the U. S. This list vas duplicated on 5 X 8 cards

and maintained at

TBIQ and appropriate field offices

During

1940 the list ot individuals which had been compiled became

Inown es the "Custodial Detention List." To supplement

information available at FBIHQ, the tield was instructed to

submit names of individuals who should be considered for the

Custodial Detention List with data justifying their being placed

on this list.

Following extensive efforts by the rBI to obtain

policy regarding this list,

the office of the Attorney General

on April 21, 1941, provided a memorandum outlining the procedures

for the FBI

The Attorney

General requested this list be subdividod into those

individuals to be arrosted immediatoly on declaration of

war; individuals reconnended for reloase on bond, parole,

or on whom travel restriction be iuposed; and those strongly

suspected and on whon surveillance should be continued.

The cards maintained on these individuals were

initially referred to as "Internal Security Cards"; however,

this was later changed to Security Index cards,

Following

World Wax II, all SI cards were cancelled at the iBi with

the exception ot those relating to communists, fussians,

and indiviquals whose nationalistic tendencies resulted

Iron ideological or organizational affiliations with larxist

groups.

P SECRED

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

As a result of the international situation in 1948,

a Comnunist Index was

established, as distinguished from

the

SI, and this index was conprised of all Comnunist Party

members and reported members of communist organizations.

On September 23,

1950, the Internal Security Act

o1 1950, became law and with it the passage of Title lI

which concerned the Emergency Detention Act.

This act

provided for the detention of individuals believed to be

dangerous to the internal security during times of emergency

and required communist organizations and their individual

members to register with the Atterney

• General within 30 days

after September 25, 1900.

During 1951 a list of the individuals

maintained on the. SI was prepared and furnished to the

Department of Justice. During 1955 the Department advised

the FBI that neither manpower nor funds were available for the

Department to review SI cases and in the event of an emergency

the Attorney General would direct all persons named in the sI

to be promptly apprehended..

During 1960, the Reserve Index (RI) was established

and was comprised of those cards which had formerly been known

as the Conmunist Indes,

It was believed the Reserve Index was

& more descriptive term and individuals named therein were

affiliated with various subversive organizations, including the

Communist Party.

The RI represented a group of individuals,

who, next to sI

subjeets, presented the greatest potential

threat to the internal security of this country in time of

emergency.

The RI was discontinued along with the sI upon

repeal of

the Emergency Detention Act during September, 1971.

(1) During September, 1971,

the Attorney General was

requested to advise whether repeal of the EDA limited the

authority of the FBI to conduct security investigations or

maintain an administrative index of security subjects.

The

Attorney General advised during October, 1971, that the

FBI's investigative authority remained unaffected and the FBI

was not prohibited from maintaining an index of security

subjects.

As a result in November, 1971,

an Administrative

Index (ADEX) was established which

included the names of

those individuals on the former SI in September, 1971.

During

1972 the operation of the ADEX was evaluated and revised to

include only those individuals who posed a realistic, direct

and current danger to the national security.

In addition to the above-nentioned indices,

the

FBI also maintained a Dominican Ind: (DI), details con-

corning which are set forth below:

When the Dominican revolution crupted on April 24,

1900, our Government had practically no verified intelligence

data concerning Doninican Republic (D.R.) subversives.

Intelligence agencies having responsibilitios abroad

produced only 77 names of well-known connunists, whereas .

literally thousands of connunists and other leitists brought

about the critical situation by taking advantage of an attempted

coup.

On May 10, 1965, President Johnson ordored the FBI

MENORANDULL FOR DUE ATTORNEY GENERAL

ALL FBI INFORMAMION COILALNHE

DATE SIN BYL

•On June 26, it. Hoover sent the attached memorandum in which he

asked to be advised nether authority for the issuance of warrants for

the arrest of indivicuals on a so-called "suspect" list will in the

event of our boing involved in war originate in the Department or

whether this authority will be decentralized from the Department to

the various United States Attorneys. In order to prepare an answer

it seemed advisable to exanine in detail the entire procedure which

was used in regard to alien enemies in 1917-1919 and that which might

be used hereafter. Since the establishment of this procedure antici

nates the existence of a state of war which should not be contemplated

as an imnediate possibility and because of the major problems implicit

in such a procedure, time has been taken to give careful consideration

to the matter.

In answer to the specific question asked by Hir. Hoover, there

would seem to be no reason for a change in respect to the general

policy followed in the world ilar and outlined in your circular of

June 7, 1940, centralizing approvál here of action in national defense

The attached memorandom suggested for your signature is in

answer to iT. Hoover's question. Of course, various details in the old

procedure can be improved and we are now working out the same with the

Viar Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Retaining authorization of prosecutive action in these matters

in the Departnent here seems justified on numerous grounds. The word-

•ing of R. S. 4067 authorizes the "president" to regulate enemy aliens,

and it is doubtful if that specific grant of porte, should be delegated

further than the Attorney General.

The maintenance of policy determina-

tions here secures greater uniformity and yet permits efficient decen-

tralization of prosecutive action. It keeps all districts geared to

national action, serves to provide an over-all picture of the national

situation, permits a central bureau of records and preserves the nec-

It also tends to prevent impropor or

unjustified imprisonnent and excessive seal against suspects by over

enthusiastic United States Attorneys. Approval of formal action can

be given more advantageously by a person or agency not solely concerned

with criminal investigation or prosecutions, but able to give proper

consideration to cuestions of both national interests and the civil

liberties and rights of the individual. The emercency situations

KI. Hoover pictures can be met by powers for an emergency and the delays

ordinarily to be expected from centralized control can be cut dorm to

a minimum.

The existence of a "suspect" list contemplating nass action on

"jj" day has certain fundamental objections, howev:I, to which I wish

to call your attention. The controls available for action aside from

the arrest of persons for violation of the existing defense laws are

briefly examined in the attached menorandum, marked Exhibit A. This

discusses four classes of dangerous persons, namely, alien enemies,

aliens of other countries, naturalized citizens, and native born cit-

izens, and indicates that action should not be delayed to "ji day.

While alien enemies can be arrested on Presidential warrant and

interned in a relatively short time, because of the greater powers

available for their treatment, they constitute but a small proportion

of the dangerous persons. Except for the extreme case of an invasion

the great mass of dangerous persons can be taken care of only by de~

naturalization proceedings, deportation or arrests under existing or

proposed. laws.

Since an American citizen, naturalized or otheririse,

cannot be put in jail for being a "suspect", these cases must reach

the level of preparation óf a formal case in order to be effective.

The broad use of arrests without fully prepared cases would result in

an imnediate release of the "suspects" with or without bond and would

subject this Department to unjust criticism.

anthormore, in there

are 5,000 or more on the "suspect" list, as is probable, the postooning

of activity until "j" day will probably result in rough shod taatics.

An excess of actions against dangerous persons concentrated into a

short period would cause an overburdening of those charged with the

work, improper handling and imprisonment and tend to create the same

sort uf adverse public reaction as did the Slacker Raids in the World

War. In fact most complaints during the World War period related to

the length and condition of temporary detention, a problem groving

out of overloaded administration.

The conclusion is that as many steps as possihle should be taken

"now to avoid an undue amount of action later on. It is realized that

in various cases, there may be a sound reason for not taking action

at this time, but in many cases action or completion of preparation

for action will be possible.

with this thought in mind, I submit the

following program for your consideration and for the considera ion of

Ir. Hoover who may have objections which I have not fully considered.

1. The investigation and preparation for formal action should

be completed in as many cases as possible, both as to prosecutions and

deportation or denaturalization proceedings, even though action is not

to be immediately taken. This means that. the Criminal Division, or a

group therein, as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, should

review and prepare these cases so as to have them ready for prosecutive

or other formal action.

Such preparation con more properly be made in

• Washington than in

field in order to preserve se

secy and any

personnel assigned to the task should be satisfactory in this respect

to Hir. 'Hoover.

Proceedings should be initiated now and should not be post-

poned unless an interference with sound investigative techniques

would result.

This question should depend largely on the recommenda-

tion of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, although the suspension

of prosecutions in any probable case should also be approved by some-

one on behalf of the Attorney General.

3. In initiating steps now, particular attention should be given

by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in the case of aliens and

naturalized citizens no are considered dangerous persons, to the

basis of their entry to this country in order to develop the possi

bilities of deportation and denaturalization. Pecent legislation and

the allegiance of certain groups to foreign countries. may make this

quite effective. As far as compatible with investigative requirements,

such steps should be taken at once so that such persons may be treated

hereafter as alien enemies.

In this connection the Bureau of Immigra-

tion and Naturalization can be of considerable assistance and should

be called upon.

• :

4. The "suspect" list should be reviewed in hole or by typical

cases by someone on behalf of the Attorney General to determine, if any

sation other than prosecunion way be taken to eliminate the threat of

persons of such types; to determine il such suspects are indicative

general conditions; and to consider not only the establishment of

forbidden areas, the limitation on the award of war contracts and

other protective measures but also the possibility of positive mea-

sures, other than propaganda, for winning loyalty through authorized

activities by other government agencies.

The possible cooperation of citizens' groups might be considered

in dealing with groups, but not with individuals or here there is a

l danger of a disclosure of confidential investigative information.

5. The possibilities should be explored by this Unit of legisla-

tion which, inthin the framework of civil rights, will provide additional

controls over those dangerous persons no are United States citizens or

naturalized citizens as well as aliens and natives of neutral nations.

For example, legislation wich would cut down on the 60 day period

required for personal service in denaturalization proceedings might

provide a possibility in the case of raturalized citizens.

6. The Federal Bureau of Investigation should be requested to

submit for confidential use, a general picture of the number, types,

Ww 55099 DocId:32989621! Page 20

and location of cases composing the "suspect" list and other pertinent

factors having some bearing on the administrative load. The analysis

should be reviewed with an eye to establishing in advance instructions,

procedure, and policy particularly with reference to alien enemies and

the drafting of legislation.

Doubtless It. Hoover will have suggestions and modifications on

the content of this memorandun.

It is submitted to you first in the

absence of any discussion with him to secure an expression from you

concerning any difficulties which the subject matter presents and how

you wish these matters taken up with tir. Hoover.

Re: Classes of persons which compose the so-called

"suspect list" and possible steps tol be taken

in controlling them.

It is to be assumed that the "suspect list" is made up of four

classes of persons:

1. Aliens who would become alien enemies in the event

of a declaration of war between the United States

and their native countries;

2. Aliens of other countries;

•3.

Naturalized citizens;

4. Native-born citizens.

If there were approximately 5,000 persons on such a list, it seems

reasonable to assume that there would be roughly 1,000 alien enemies,

500. aliens of other countries, 2, naturalized naturalized citizens, and 1,000

native-born citizens.

The controls available for these classes of persons, discussed

hereafter, are entirely aside Irom the possible arrest of persons for

violation of existing defense lavs.

The question of control will arise,

(a) in the

event of war involving the United States where there is

invasion, or (b) in the event of war involving the United States winere

there is no invasion, or (e) where there is a national emergency of any

sort.

:

HN 55099 DocId:32989621 Page 22

## Page 23

Har: where there is an invasion

In contemplating the control of these persons if

there is a declaration of war and an actual invasion, there

1s, of course, the possibility of declaring martial law which

would apply to all citizens and aliens alike. This is the

extreme and least probable case.

It presupposes the possibility

of the derial of the writ of habeas compus and trial by military

tribunals for all.

In the case of alien enemies, there is also at present

statutory authorization enabling the President to order their

arrest and internment as set out beloir.

War:

where there is no invasion

Assuming that there is a declaration of war without

•an invasion of the soil of the United States, the law is clear

as to alien enemies. There is statutory authority which permits

the President to control their conduct in every respect. They

may be arrested by Presidential warrant and interned or paroled

as the necessity indicates. The internment procedure of the

World War period was handled through, close cooperation between

this Department and the War Department, and there seems to have

been little criticism of the machinery once internment as

decided upon. Details of the procedure followed are being

studied in so far as it is felt they can be made useful in a

plân for cooperati

retireen the lar Department and

ie Department of

Justice in any' future emergency:

It is apparent that there was much criticism of the delay incident

upon handling cases for decision as to wether the alien enemy should

be interned or not.

This delay necessitated long periods in temporary

prison quarters which

the Department of Justice was at the time ill

prepared to provide.

The "orld Tar experience shows that most of the

conglaints concerning personal mistreatment made bj arrested alien

enemies referred to the length and conditions o their temporary deten-

tion.

The situation in respect to aliens of other than eneny countries

is different. There is a possibility of deportation of a limited

percentage of these for fraud in obtaining their passports or for il-

legality of entry. The visa of a person in this country temporarily

could be cancelled for a violation of its conditions. Except for ob

vious fraud or illegality these cases would be uncertain and slow. There

,Is the further practical difficulty that many aliens could not be deported

because there is no place to nich they could be deported since their

native country no longer exists or would be unrilling to accept them

and there is no statutory authority for their detention in custody in

this country. Legislation, limited in scope, might be drawn to deal ith

unfriendly aliens in time of war. There are, even at the present tine,

for instance, certain restrictions, with regard to the employment of aliens

in furnishing or constructing aircrait or aircraft parts or aeronautical

accessories for tine United States as set out in I0 U.SiC. 310 j.

Naturalized citizens can be cealt iritin as in the world War by means

of denaturalization proceedings whereby they are again returned to the

status of aliens and controlled as any other alien or alien enemy.

One impracticable feature in connection with this form of proceeding

lies in the fact that there must be 50 days personal service before

instituting proceedings, wich slovs down procedure particularly for

serious cases.

Citizens are, of course, protected by all constitutional

guarantees as to civil rights: There was a suggestion made during the

World War period for legislation which would permit the cancellation

of bail in the case of habitual offenders and violators particularly

at that time of the Espionage Act. Other suggestions related to the

extension of the use of military courts in time of war. These sugges-

tions are, horever, of doubtfui wisuvi. The fixing of bail has no

•

real connection with the seriousness nor number of the offenses. The

military court idea was, in the grld War period and after, the target

for bitter criticism as a violation of civil rights by Departnent

officials and public alike.

National Emergency Period

Coming finally to the national emergency which is not war but is

related to war, there are no alien enemies who can be dealt with as

such.

There is little that can be done excapt to proceed against

violators under the existing lans, or institute denaturalization

proceedings and deportation proceedings. New legislation holds very

Limited possibilities:

In reference to the list of persons against. whom pro

Passians.

Naturalized citizens arriving in the

I thing tiese should be sub

divided according to country' of origin as above.

In every classification I think ie should have

Re: Suspect List

ARE TEL UTTORICATION CONTAINED

This memozandum will refer to thelpolicy and procedure for

handling matters connected with the Suspect list in so far as they

affect the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Special Defense

The directions set out below bring doin to date the various

memoranda and suggestions of the Attorney General on the above-

described subject.

I. General Policy

The entire Suspect List is to be revieved by the Special

Defense Unit to determine if prosecution or any other action mey be

taken to elininate the threat of persons of the type named therein;

to determine if such suspects are indicative of general conditions

and to consider not only the establishment of forbidden areas, the

Mimitation on the avaraing oiliar contracts and other protective

measures but also the possibility of positive measures, other than

propaganda, for rinning their loyalty through authorized activities

by other Government agencies.

The revier of these matters will be

given strictly confidential treatment.

The Special Delense Unit Till also explore the possibility of

legislation mich, vithin the framenork of civil rights, till provide

additional controls over persons considered to be dangerous to the

national defense who are United States citizons or naturalized citi-

zens as well as alien

enemies and citizens of neutral nations.

2.

The investigation and preparation for formal action should

be completed so far as possible, as to prosecution and'deportation or

denaturalization proceedings, or other feasible proceedings, even

though action is not to be innediately taken.

This means

that the

Bureau of Imizration and Naturalization and the Criminal Division

are to revier and prepare such appropriate cases as are referred io then

by the Special Defense Unit so as to have them ready for prosecution on

other formal action.

Particular attention is to be given, in the casa

of aliens and natwalized citinens, to the basis oi their entry into

this country and sinilar matters in order io develop the possibilíur

of their deportation and/or denaturalization.

## Page 30

= =

Formal proceedings are to be initiated now and are not

to be postponed unless the l'ederal Bureau of Investigation indicates

that the instituiion of suci brocesdings might interfere with sound

investigative techniques, and suspension of prosecution is approved

by the Special Defense Unit on behalf of the Attorey General.

The adoption of the procedure outlined below for the

handling of these natiers does not involve any abandonment by the

Department of its present facilities for obtaining information in

connection witnysubversite activities by surveillance or !counter-

espionage.

No public disclosure of ary confidential informant

being used by the Bureau is to be made without the prior approval

of the Bureau.

II. • Procedure to be followed by the

Federal Bureau of Investisation

A. Re: Xolassification of persons on suspect Iist

sane ......

The persons on the Suspect List are to be classified as

(I) aliens, (2) naturalized citizons, (3} citizens native horn.

2.

the list off

persons in classification (1) and (2) is to

be subdivided into Gerans, Russians, Italians, Japanese, Axis-

occupied countries, others.

The persons on the list are to be divided into three groups

as to the degree oi their possible dangerousness to the national

deiense, I.e., Glass i, those nose remaining at large would possibly

be dangerous to the national relfare; Class B, those to be considered

• for limitation as to activities; and Class C, those whose activities

warrant their being carried on such a list but as to whom the available

information is not considered sufficient to warrant inclusion in

Clases A or B.

Bo Re: Submitting natorial to the Special Defense Unit.

to References to all the material previously submitted by the

Bureau to the Department and copies of any reports not previously

submitted to the Department on those individuals considered to be in

Class A whether aliens, naturalized or native-born citizens are to be

submitted by the Bureau to the Special Defense Unit in such numbers

and at such tines as it may request.

Later, material on Class B.

individuals is to be submitted.

The Bureau is to be prepared to supply the Department "ith

additional copies of menoranda or reports previously submitted to the

Department in those cases in which a thorough search of the depart

mental files fails to bring then to light.

laterial being transmitted to the Special Defense Unit is

to be marked "personal and confidential" and should be enclosed in a

sealed envelope addressed tom

Defense Unit.

III.

Procedure to be followed by the Federal Bureau of

Investigation in the event of war with respect to

alien enemies.

The persons who become alien enenies and the conditions under.

which the statute declares such persons to be alien enemies are

described in 50 U.S.C. 21.

Upon the occurrence of the conditions described in the statute

and following the promulgation oi a Presidential Froclamation contain-

ing regulations governing the control and conduct of all persons vo

autonatically become alien enemies in accordance with the terns o1 une

statute, instructions to Uniteà States Attorneys and to United States

Marshals and supplemental instructions to the Federal Bureau of Investi-

gation till be confidentially released in tine to advise those con-

cerned of the necessary procedure to jolion.

All warrants will be

authorized and issued by the Attorney General.

The functions of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in connec-

tion mith the alien enemy progran till be as follows:

collection suri in the verious federa alone one the

regarding

all len enemies considered potentially dangerous in the

United States,

s, Aläska,

Farraii, Puerto Pico and the Virgin islands,

Care should be ezerciseà in all cases to determine citizenship so

that no American citizens are included. Facts concerning the alien

enemy nich may be obtained from ire Bureau of Irmigration and

Naturalization, under inose technical supervision all aliens fall,

should ibe included in this incoration.

It is assumed that a check

mll also be made of compliance by the alien enemy with statutes

and regulations peculiarly affecting him such as the Alien Registration

Act, and regulations mich might hereaîter require passes, identifi..

cation cards, etc. for alien enenies.

The Attorney General should be advised from time to time of the

nature and scopè of the problem to be anticipated.

## Page 32

With respect to those alien enemies whose cases have been

reviewed by the special Deîense Unit under the established procedure

described above for persons on the Suspect List, to subnit to the United

States ittorney concerned, promptly upon the promulgation of the

President's Proclanation one copy of every report previously transmitted

to the department, or a surmary report containing all pertinent informa-

tion in such reports so as to enable him to review all facts before

acting upon a varrant for arrest of the alien enemy.

Kith respect to any alien enemy believed to be dangerous,

whose case has not been hitherto reviered and whose arrest it is deemed

may be in the best interests of the inited States, to submit to the

United States Attorney concerned, tiro copies of every report in the

Bureau's files which contains any pertinent information or a surmary

report in duplicate containing all pertinent infomation.

One copy

of such report will be retained by the United States Attorney in his

permanent files, and one copy vill be used by him along with the

infornation record, hereinafter described to transmit to the Deparinent,

•as the basis for a request for the issuance of a Presidential varrant or

other action. A third copy is to be forwarded to the Department in

Washington.

Infornation transnitted as heretofore described should be

accompanied by a separate information record.

Whether the case of an

alien enemy has been hitherto revierred by the Special Defense Unit or

not, to copies of the information record are to be transnitted to the

United States Attomey along with the aforementioned report or reports

upon which it is to be based. A third copy is to be forsarded to the

Departuent for permanent filing, together with the information report

or reports transmittea.

It is upon this information record, iogether

path the information reports, that a decision will be made upon the

request oi the United States Attorney for the issuance of a Fresidential

warrant by the Attorney General. [military authorities will handle

arrests and interments in the Canal Zone and in the Philippine. Islands].

The infornation recora is to contain a sumary of the factual

material concerning the neme, age, nationality, and activities of the

alien enemys, sufficiently adequate to enable the United States Attorney

to obtain a working knowledge oi. each case before studying the entire

file.

Particular attention is likerise to be given to any information

*The items mentioned are suggestions only and it is not assumed that the

enumeration is as complete as is necessary to make the infornation record

useful.

It is contemplated that the experience of the Bureau will be

utilized in supplenenting the list of Items given.

with reference to such matters as the peculiar inowledge, abilities,

or habits of the individual nich would be userul to custodial authorities

if he should be interned.

Suitable spaces areito be provided in this

infornation record to enable the United States Attorney to complete it

with entries regarding the hearing given the alien eneny, any auctional

information then obtained, the aisposition of his case, applications

lor appeal, etc. LIt mill be appreciated if copies of the for to

be used for this information record are submitied to the Department

before they are finally adopted.]

40

In a limited number of emergency cases here infornation on

file prior to the promulgation oî a Presidential Proclanation estau

lishes beyond doubt that the activities of an alien enemy are clearly

dangerous to the interests of the United States, and where it appears

that unless he is arrested immediately irreparable damage to the United

States will result, infornation is to be transnitted directly iron the

Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington to the Department in

Mashington. If approved a Presidential versant will then be inediately

issued and authority to arrest wired direct to the United States

Attorney in the Federal district concerned.

To assist the United States liarshal or his deputy in making

arrests at the request of the United States Liarshal and with the

approval of the United States Attorney, or to make arrests, where the

emergency or the special character of the case requires assistance,

upon request to that elfect by the United States Attorney.

6. Io continue investigation after arrests are made to the

extent requested by the united States Attorney, and to subnit copies

of all reports on such investigations to the United States Attorney,

' in duplicate copy, in order to enable him to suomit to the Department

a copy oi any investigative report upon rhich he bases recomenda-

tions or conclusions, and in addition to submit one copy to the

Department.

7.

Folloring arrest, to assist at the request of the United

States Attorney, at any infornal hearing granted the alien enemy.

this hearings while not a matter of right, till be allowed to enable

the United States Attorney to obtain infornation from the alien enemy

as to his citizenship, age, loyalty, and activities. It is on the

basis of this hearing together kith the investigative reports of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation that the United States Attorney will

make recommendations to the Attorney General for disposition of the

alien eneny's case in terns of interment, parole, with or without

bond, or conditional or unconditional release.

MERIORANDULA FOR IR. HOOVER, DIPECTOR, FEDERAI, BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

•Reference is made to the dossiers on certain individuals

being submitted by you to this Unit for consideration for possible

custodial detention in the event of a national energency. On the

basis of the information contained on the dossiers a tentative

determination is made as to the dangerousness of the individual in

terms of "A", "B" or "c", and also as to the sufficiency of the

evidence in terms of iy

or "2".

As to the dangerousness classification, in Group "A" will

be placed those who are believed to be host dangerous and who, in

all probability, should be' interned in the event of war.

In group

*B" will be placed those persons who are believed to be somewhat less

dangerous but whose activities should be restricted.

In group "C"'

will be placed those believed to be the least dangerous, and who need

not be restricted in the absence of additional information, but who

should be subiected to general

- surveillance.

With regard to the

classification of sufficiency of the evidence, the numeral. "1" placed

after the letters "д", "g" or "C" indicates the evidence is sufficient

to establish the charges upon which the dangerousness classilication

was made, while the nuneral "?", similarly used, indicates that the

evidence is not considerea saulsiactory to substantiate the charges

and further investigation may be necessary.

Please be advised that the individuals, whose names and

addresses are shom on: the attached list, have been tentatively

classified in Class A-1.

This classification is subject to revision' in the light of

the contemplated future revier of all material in the files of the.

Bureau with respect to these individuals and of any additional.

information that may be hereaîter submitted to this Unit.

You will

be kept advised, of course, of any change in the classification or

evaluation indicated.

Re:

Iyo points vath referance tò theltustodial Detention/rocedure

1.

Since the latter part of July this unit has requested

further Bureau investigations in nore than 100 cases oi potential alier

enemdes tno noula de considered lor custodial detention in une event o1

the issuance of a Presidential Proclanation under Saction 21, Pita: 50

U.S.C.

In each of these cases the Bureau was requested to deteimine,

among other things, whether the parson concerned was an alien, a

naturalized citizen, or a native

born citizen.

In each request for

investigation it ras stated "In the event your investigation discloses

that he is not an alien, no further investigation will be liecessary at

"this time".

It ras not oux intention, however, by the use of the quoted

Languase, to suggest that the Bureau should stop its investigation

irmediately upon detornining that the subject is niot an alien if the

facüs indicated that further investigation should be nade for the

puxpose of determining the possible violation oi some other eristing

statute or for any other surposa mnich the burcau right deen sopro-

It was intended by that statenent to suggest only that •

further investigation rould not be necessary in so far as consideration

for custodial detention, is concered in the event oi the issuance of a ,

Presidential Froclanation under Section 21 of fitle 50 U.S.E., covering

the subject of the investigation.

In order to clear up any possible doubts in this connection

2.

In my memorandum to you of July 24, 1941, you were generally

advised of the danger classification and evidence evaluation designa-

tions being given by this Unit to the cases being referred here by the

Bureau for consideration for possible custodial detention in the event

of a national emergency. All such cases, whether they concer

potential alien enemies, aliens of other countries, naturalized

citizens, or native born citizens, are being tentatively classified

by means of these designations.

Ine designation "A" is given to

those cases which concern individuals whose activities are considered

potentially most dangerous to the safety of the country, "3" to those

less dangerous, and "C" to those least dangerous.

The Arabic numeral

"I" in all cases is used to indicate that the evidence being considered

is deemed to be sufficiently satisfactory to substantiate the danger

classification mace, while the numeral "2" indicates that the evidence

is not sufficiently satisfactory for that purpose.

However, it is only in connection with those individuals who

are potential alien enemies that the designations "A", "B", and "e"

also indicate the action which it is contemplated irill be taken in

their cases in the event of the issuance of a Presidential Proclamation

under Section 21, Title 50 U.S.C., such as internment, restricted

activities, continued surveillance.

The designations given to all

other individuals are being forarded to you at your request and

solely for your general infornation and should not be considered as

any indication of any possible action which might be taken with

reference to them.

ATTACELENT TO HFLICRANDUL FOR THE ATTORNEY GENBRAI, ON

SPECIAI: CASES

ALL FLI ETORIZATION CONTAINED

In order adequately to discharge the Departuentss responsibility

of protecting'internal security in the event of a national emergency,

It pras necessary to make an appraisal of the nature and scope oi

Fartime security problems to be anticipated, and to formulate procedures

and plans to meet such problems efficiently, promptly and mith scrupulous

regard for the preservation of civil rights.

These needs gave rise to

the special case progran in the summer of 1940.

Special case work, as the records of the Department amply demon

strate, has made a continuing and substantial contribution to the

soLution of nunerous wartime security problens of the Department. It

made possible a tell-organized and smoothly functioning alien enemy

control program with minimun delay. Special case work started investi

gations to secure evidence respecting potential alien enemies long

before the war began. It established carefully morked out standards

for determining that types of activities justified apprehension and

• custodial detention. It supplied information as to the number of aliens

those apprehension was. to be anticipated. An inventory was made of

i available custodial facilities and steps were taken to secure. facilities

there the number of special cases indicated that existing facilities

mere inadequate or nonexistent. These cases provided a lactual basis

'fordeciding the number and geographical location of hearing boards and

the Presidential Proclamations in effect since the outbreak of the war.

were in large measure based upon inforation derived from special

cases. Notwithstanding the failure by the Departient to adhere strictly

•to the special case procedure at the outbreak of HaI, I all convinced

that the careful formulation of procedures and the criteria for dealing

nith alien eremies exercised a restraining influence on any tendency

toward indiscriminate apprehensions.

In a somerhat similar manner special case fork, over a period of

montos, resulted in the development of a denaturalization program.

• Such a program was set up in the Criminal Division in February, 1942,

utilizing at the outset the experiences, the cases selected and even

the persomel of this Unit. This work also supplied much oî the

infomation revealing the inadequacies and the deficiencies of the

UcCornack Act and particularly Section I thereof, and thereby facilitated

the redraiting of that Act. It was the basis of

our reconmendation to

the Attorney General that no alien enemy proclamations be issued with

respect to aliens of Hungary, Fumania and Bulgaria men those countries

doclared war on us. It furnished a great deal of vital information in

our programs relating to the activities of pro-jois organizations. It

furished the information which enabled us to stimulate the program

against subversives in far industries in the War and Navy Departnents.

Information acquired through the special cases enabled us to demon

strate to the satisfaction of the Tar and Navy Departments that the

employment of aliens as a class presented no greater threat to our

•. Internal security than the employment of naturalized citizens as a

class. This paved the nay for the President's Directive of July 1l,

1942, encouraging the employment of aliens in iar industries, mich

tras drafted in this Init in conjunction with the far and Navy

Departments. Special case work was useful as late as the landing of

Americal troops in North Africa, when me made a detailed revier for

the attorney General of that steps;it any, should be taken in regard

to the Vichy French, and on taich review te mere conplimented.by the

Attorney General.

me origin of special case nork and its development prior to

tsarl Harbor are described in the folloiäng excerpts from a confidential

Remorandum prepared for the Buaget on October 31, 1941.

...

Fin accordance niüh the Fresident's Diractive of Soptenbor 5,

1939, all investigations in internal security matters have been

tentralised in the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In order to

handle the tremendous number of such matters (estimated by the

Attorney General to be 2500 per day) the number of special agents

Of the Bureau has been increased from 750 to over 2700.

To meet this difficuliy a system of counter-espionage

and aurveillance was therefore developed by the Federal Bureau

of Investigation. • i•

#on June 26, 1940, Mr. Hoover called to the attention of the

Attorney General the lact that for some time the Bureau had been

gathering infornation on individuals whose activities might be

dangerous to the safety of the country in the event of a national

energency and he requestsd the Depariment to formulate a program

so handle these cases.

"After careful study and research into. the Federal" stat-

utes,

the experience of the country durirg the last war, the

experience of other countries during this mar, and consulta-

tions with surezü officials, menbers of the Criminal Division,

and other officers of, the Department, a plan was dèvelouca to

complement the excellent surveillance and counter-espionage

nork being done by the. Bureau and the prosecutions reing handled

by the CrininaI Division by utilizing all possible administra-

tive, preventive and nor-prosecutive powers of the various gov-

emmental agencies to handle this special type of case being

developed by the sureau. This plan for handling,such special

cases was presented to the Attorney General on September 23,

1940, and received his approval. the procedure which it pro

vides for and which is now being followed is briefly outlined

below.

"These special cases are submitted by the Bureau to

this Unit through the transmittal of dossiers reflecting the

Information in the Bureau's files. the Bureau advised

us to prepare for a minimum of 18,000 such cases ...

"Since the Federal Bureau of Investigation is selecting

these special cases from the many thousands of internal secur

Ity cases being brought to their attention. • it would appear

that each one of these. special cases should receive careful and

Individual handling. On the other hand, the very number and

" importance of these cases has made it imperative for us to work

out a procedure whereby first things would be handled first,

1.e., attention given to the most dangerous cases and to the

most critical situations without necessitating an immense legal

and adninistrative staff to do the work. Another consideration

which has had to be kept constantly in mind is the fact that we

• must keep as current as possible in the work since no one knows

just when the nost serious kind of national emergency might

suddenly develop. ...

"Upon the receipt of a dossier the information con-

tained thereon is analyzed by one of the younger lawyers as-

signed to this work and placed upon what is called a classifi-

cation form"under the following headings: (a) name, (b) citi-

zenship status, (c, address, (a) political sympathies, I. e.,

N221, Fascist, corrunist, ete, (e) employment, (f) organiza-

tions, (g) activities, (h) special facts. In addition a tenta-

tive classification in terms of dangerousness and evidence

evaluation

and ary possible action which might be taken to

neutralize the dangerousness are noted on the form under the

headings "danger classification' and 'suggested action', re-

spectively.

The designation 'A' is used to indicate the most

dangerous

cases; 1B' the less dangerous; and if: the least

dangerous.

The numeral 11' is used to indicate that the evi-

dence is sufficient to sustain the danger classification and

82' is used to indicate that the evidence is not sufficient.

the forms are then reviewed by two or more older and more ex

perienced lawyers and are codifled and cross-filed. The form

contains, of course, spaces for the initials of the classifier

and reviener and the dates of their work and for the file code

numbers.

The dossier itself becomes the basic document for an

Individual file folder which is then filed alphabetically in

the special case fils.

"upon the receipt of a dossier and before the analysis

ard classification referred to above is done, a representative

of the Inmigration and Naturalization Service reviews, under

the supervision of this Unit, and takes off the dossier the

necessary information to identify any files wich that Service

may have in their In different file sections with reference to

this individual.

The purpose of this revier and search is to

have a definitive statenent fron that Service as to the alien-

age or naturalization of all persons covered by the dossiers

and to receive a report from that Service as to the possibility

of taking any action under the alien lawg, administrative or

prosecutive, with reference to any individuals so identified. -

"The main purpose of this preliminary analysis and tenta-

tive classification is to bring to our attention at the earliest

possible noment the nost important facts with reference to the

most dangèrous cases so that such cases can be given priority in

treatrent. nother reason for this analysis and classification

1s to make avatlable at once the significant facts of the case

for general study and planning purposes. In this connection

your attention is called to the great amount of work which has

been involved in working out policies and procedures for a

possible alien enemy program, as well as programs in connection

with subversive elements in national defense and other vital

: Industries, and other matters relative to civil defense in

which this analysis has been helpful.

"After the case has been so analyzed and' classified, the

Bureau is advised of the classification thereof and, at pres-

ent, if the case is classified as A-1 or A-2, a request is made

for all the underlying naterial thereon in the Bureau iles.

After al? the A cases have been taken care of a similar request

mill be made for a1l B cases •.. •

"Since the tentative classification previously made rep

resented only an opinion based upon the limited facts in the

dossier, it has been lound that in many cases the facts con-

tained in the underlying material necessitate changes in the

classification of the case either as to the dangerousness of

the suspect or the sufficiency of the evidence, or both. If

the attorney reviering the underlying material is of the opin

Ion that the dangerousness classification of the case should

be changed irom A to B or 5, he prepares a memorandum in suo-

port of that change, which is then summitted for the approval

of the chief of his

subsection and the chier of the Civil De-

fense Section. Thereafter the case is returned to the files

until such time as the general B or C class, as the case may

be, Is given consideration. Upon completing this revier and

moon finding that no additional investigation is needed, that

is that the case should be properly classified as an A-] case,

& sumary memorandum is prepared setting out the basic inform-

stion available concerning the suspect, whick shows his danger-

the source of the evidence with reference thereto, and

such additional information as may be pertinent to substentiate

the final determination made in the case. This menorandum is

then submitted to the chier of his subsection and the chief of

the Civil Defense Section before it is placed in the files of

the tait for use at the appropriate time.

"where it is determined that further investigation is

noeded or other information required, the necessary memoranda

to the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Immigration and

Naturalization Service are prepared. "

As indicated in the foregoing memorandum, the special case pro-

cedure contemplated tro separate processings for each case. The first

processing, rhich resulted in the assigmment of a tentative danger

classification, was a preliminary sifting or screening of dossiers,

abereby the most serious prima facie cases were selected for prefer

ential treatment as to further and more detailed consideration. The

second processing tas a careful analysis of the case based upon a

full report after investigation, and tas intended to serve as a

guide for the Department in dealing with the subject in the event. of

an acute national emergency.

With regard to a large number of potential alien enemy cases,

the first and second processing were both completed and classifica

tions of dangerousness were assigned and were given to lit. Hoover.

While it is true that apprehensions of many individuals were made

Tithout regard to the system of classification, it seems clear that

• the Unit's careful formulation of procedures and of criteria for

desling with alien enemies exercised a restraining influence on any

tendency toward indiscriminate apprehensions.

with respect to non enemy aliens and citizens, only the first

processing operation was performed.. On December 26, 1941, the

Attorney General issued instructions which in effect directed that

the Unit should not perform the second processing in such cases but

instead should transmit them to the Criminal Division for the examina

tion of the underlying naterial, direction of further investigation,

and consideration of appropriate action. In all such cases, therefore,

the classification assigned by this Unit ras a result merely of the

first processing. It was the practice of the Criminal Division, with

respect to special cases submitied to it, to send a general form

memorandum to the Federal Bureau of Intestigation requesting an

investigation. It soon became apparent, however, that under this

practice. the cases were not being developed adequately; no action ras

taken and the number of pending cases mounted steadily. Accordingly,

on April 23, 1942, I sent to dir. is a memorandum to the Attorney

, General detailing

the program and suggesting that either the Criminal

Division or this Unit be instructed to secure the underlying material

in these cases and, after a careful revier of such material, prepare

requests specifying the nature and type of investigation to be made.

On July 10, 1942

I sent a nemorandum to the Solicitor General, with

•a copy to bir. e

reading as follows:

*On April 17, 1942, I sent to Mr. al* a memorandum .

mat he tone ens on resting at end under on

secured from the FBI, and carefully reviewed by attorneys, .

who mould then prepare requests to the FBI, specifying the

appropriate investigation in each case. It was suggested

that this procedure should replace the presént procedure

whereby the Criminal Division sends to the FBI a form

, request (see copy attached) for a general investigation.

I believe that the latter is not an adequate direction to

the FBI, and that it has not been effective, for it has

not produced action in many cases.

*On Hay 22, 1942, you sent to Mr.

& memorandum

soproving my suggestion, and asking him whether he wished

these cases to be developed by his staff or by the Special

Far Polices Unit.

"Attached hereto 1s a resume of a nunber of typical

cases, with a brief summary of the facts, and an indication

of certain lines along mhich a specific,

rather than a general,

Investigation should be cirected.

The files indicate that

although the Criminal Division sent to the FBI requests for

general investigation, as far back as December 1941, no reply

thereto has been made by the FBI in these, and no further

action has been, taken. I believe that the situation in these

cases illustrates the point suggested above, and shows that

the cases call for nore positive action.

"the files in numerous other cases, which this Unit.

referred to the criminal Division some months ago, do not

indicate that any action has been taker, or that even the

request for general investigation has been given to the FBI.

*I feel that the present procedure does not adequately

neet the war situation by a positive program, and should be

Perised accordingly. Prior to December 7, 1941, when this

Unit was preparing for the possibility of issuance of an

alien enemy proclamation, this Unit folloned the procedure

Buggested herein, in connection with potential enemy aliens.

It ras then lound that requests for investigation along

definite and specified lines produced reasonably prompt and

, affective aotion on the part of the FBI.

"I sttach an extra copy of this nemorandum, which I

thought you might wish to send to ur.

I suggest that

& conference be had, to mork out this program.""

Conferences mere had with Ir. tall and in August 1942, it was

agrsed that the Criminal Division would give the necessary attention to

the Special Cases submitted to it, and not this Unit. This understand-

Ing ras corfirmed in li. == nemorandum to ra, dated August 7, 1942,

and my memorandum to ki.

oi, dated August 8, 1942.

In the autumn of 1942 this Unit undertook to revexamine its special

esse work to determine whether the circunscrioad junction served a

sufficiently useiul purpose to warrant the continued expenditure of the

araporer of the tro laryers emoloyed on it full time since June. In

December 1942, ne discontinued the practice of making danger classiii-

cations and giving notice thereof, and thereaiter concluded that these

cases should be examined by us pritarily for information in connection

with other nork of the Unit. Alter reviewing the cases on this basis

for some time, it was decided that only the reports of cases in the Con-

munist field provided suificient infornation to justify the time expenced

in the revier, and accordingly the fBI ras recently requesteà to dis-

continue serding its reports except in those cases where the subject is

alleged to be connected directly or indirectly with the Communist Party

or one or more of its front organizations.

of the country in the event of a national emergency. The Special

Case program was developed out of extensive conferences with repre-

sentatives of the federal Bureau of Investigation, the Criminal

Division, and other officers of the Department, and was presented

to Attorney teneral Jackson on September 23, 1940, and approved by

him. I am attaching a memorandum which sets out in some detail the

history of the programi

As the memorandum shows; the Special Case procedure contemplated

two separate processings for each case. The first processing, which

resultad in the assignment of a "tentative danger classification",

was so more than a preliminary sifting or screening of the Federal

Bureau of investigation dossiers, for the purpose of selecting the

sost serious prina facie cases for preferential consideration and lor

priority of investigation. The second processing was a careful

analysis of the case based upon a lull report alter invastigation,

and was intended to sarve as a guide for the Department in dealing

with the subject in the event of an acute national emergency.

With regard to a large nunber of potential enemy alien cases, the

first and second processings were both completed, and classifications

of dangerousness were assigned and given to ir, Hoover. While it is

true that, over the protest of this Unit, many individuals were appre-

¡ hended without regard to the system of classification, I am convinced

¡that the careful formulation of procedures and of criteria for deal-

ing with allen enemes exercised a restraining influence on any

geographical location of the hearing boards, and for the provision

of the necessary custodial facilities. Special Case work made other

continuing and substantial contributions to the solution of many far-

c. time security problens of the Department; and has been a major

factor in the development of a number of departmental programs and

policies nich are more fully described in the attached memorandulle

Since the outbreak of the war, however, the functions of this

Unit in relation to Special Cases have been sharply circumscribed.

On December 26, 1941, you issued instructions which in effect directed

that the unit should not perform the second processing, but, after

assigning tentative danger classifications on the basis of unverifies

Federal Bureau of Investigation dossiers, should transmit the cases

to the Criminal Division for examination of the underiying naterial,

direction of further investigation, and consideration of appropriate

action.

In several menoranda to, of conferences with, dro fun Mr.

sat and Mr. a during the spring and summer of 1942 I pointed

out that the procedure as it was being handled had failed to provide

a posItive program to meat the mar situation, and tnaü although int

sumber of pending cases tas mounting steadily the cases themsslves

ware not being developed adequately. Finally, in the autumn of 1942,

I undertook to re-examine the Unit's Special Case work to determine.

.,whether our circunscribed functions served a suificiently useful pur

pose to marrant their continuance. I concluded that vera tentative

classifications, based upon unverified dossiers or preliminary re-

ports and not supplemented promptly by the thorough second processing

originally contenplated, served no useful function, and in addition

were subject to the danger of nisconstruction, in that they might

appear to indicate a judgment of actual dangerousness, rather than

merely a selection of cases for priority of investigation Accord-

Ingly, in December, 1942, ve discontinued the practice of making

danger classifications and communicating those classifications to the :

Federal Bureau of Investigation in all cases received after Decem

ber 18, 1942, and thereater decided to confine our revies of the

cases to an examination primarily for information in connection with

other rork of the Unit:

Aiter reviewing the cases on this basis for

sone time, it was decided that only the reports of cases in the Com-

minist field provided sufficient information to justify the time ex-

pended in the revien, and accordingly the Federal Bureau of Investiga-

tion was recently requested to discontinue sening its reports except

in those cases nnere the subject is alleged to be connected directly

or Indirectly with the Communist Party or one or nore of its Frort

• organizations.

Some time after me had discontinued the making of danger classi

MEMORANDI FOR

HUGH B. COX, ASSISTAN ARE GIVERA

J. EDGAR HOOVER, DIRECTOR

FEDERAT, BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

I refer to Mr.

menorandum to meidated June 28,

1943, which reviers the history, development, and meaning of the Special

Case work and of the danger classifications that mere made as a part oi

that work.

After full re-consideration of these individual danger classifica-

tions, I am satisfied that they serve no useful purpose. The detention

of alien enemies is being dealt fith under the procedures established

by the Alien Enemy Control Unit.

The Special Case procedure has been

found to be valueless and is not rised in thet connection.

There is no

Istatatory authorization or other present justification for keeping a

"custodial detention" list of citizens.

The Departnent fulfills its

proper functions by investigating the activities of persons who may have

violated the laf. It is not aided in tais work by classifying persons

as to" dangerousness.

Apart from these general considerations, it is now clear to re that

this classification syster is innerently unreliable.

The evidence used

for the purpose oi making the classifications was inadequate; the stend-:

ards applied to the evidence for the purpose of making the classifica-

tions were defective; and finally, the notion that it is possible to

make a valid determination as to how dangerous a person is in the ab-

stract and nithout reference to tine, environment, and other relevant

circunstances, is impractical, unrise, and dangerous.

For the foregoing reasons I an satisfied that the adoption of this

classification systen was a mistaké that should be rectifiea for the

future. Accoräingly, I direct that the classifications heretofore made

should not be regarded as classifications of dangerousness or as a

HH 55099 DocId:32989621

determination of fact in any sense. In the future, they should

not be used for any purpose whatsoever. Questions raised as to

the status or activities of a particular verson should be dis

posed of by consideration of all available information, but

without reference to any classification heretofore made.

A copy of this memorandum should be placed in the file

of each person uno has hitherto been given a classification.

addition, each card upon which a classification appears should be

stamped with the following language:

"TEIS CLASSIFICATION IS UNRELIABIE. IT IS

Detention o1 Communists in the event oi sudden difficulty

• You have asked for my views concerning what legislation

would be required, and inst steps should be taken, in order properly

to protect the internal security oi the United States, in the event

or sudden hostilities with Fussia, by detaining members of the

Communist Party.

This matter should probably be divided into two

main topics, 'irst, the needed legislation, and second, suspension

Undoubtedly the next var, it there is one, will dwarf

all previous contlicts and justify resort to any tyce or measure

which might be needed ior the security of the Unived States.

A statute such as the Sritish Deiense of the Realm iots, which were

passed by Farliament in both world liars, 1/ might be justiried.

The british statute in lorce during World

as to authorize the secretary or state to detain "persons whose

involving atomic bonbs, robot planes and boabs, long-range

bombing plunes, parachute troops, etc., is likaly to change our

concepts of what the government should and snould not do

respecting individual rights.

However, such type oi legislation

obviousl! could nut be obtained in advance ai actual hostalities,

or. as s precautionary measure.

The Act of Farch 21, 1942, c. 191*50 Stat. 173

(18 T.S.û. Sec. 97a), the statute under which the progrem of

relocating persons ol japgnese ancestry was conducted, could and

should be utilized inmediately in the event of serious trouble

with russia.

This statute makes it a misdemeanor for anyone tò

enter,. remain in, leave or comnit any act in any military area or

military zone prescrited, under the authority of an Executive Order

of the fresident, by the secretary of far or any military commander

designated by him, contrary to the restrictions applicable to any

such ares or zone or contrary to the order of the Secretary o1' lar

or any such military comnanter.

Under it the President issued

E.0. 70. SU66 On February 19, 1942 (7 fed. Rog- 140%, authorizing

the Secretary of lar to prescribe military areas.

This was done on

the lest Coast by the general designated by the Secretary o1 "ar,

and provision was made by a series oi orders ior the relication.

of Japanese ard lor their detention--whether or not United states

oitizens--in relication centers for perious depending upon the

deterination oi their lovaruy:

The detention, si conca, was

eflected by orders declaring relocation centers to be military areas

or zones under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 972, and by other orders prohibiting

persons in those areas iron leaving them except pursuant to

regulations. is you moi, much of the actual relocation program

was carried out by the far Relocation suthority set up by the

President under I.0. 9102 dated March 18, 1942 (7 fed. Feg. 2165),

but it is unnecessary here to go into the details of its lunctions.

Three cases were decided by the Supreme Court involving

this statute. The government son two of tnem and lost the third,

but these decisions nevertheless indicate that this statute could be

used to detain all Russians and Commists, whether or not Anericar

citizens, during the initial Leriod when sieed is oi the essence

and to detain those shoin to be disloyal to the lnited States as

long as necessary.

The first or these cases, hirabavashi v. United States,

320 U.S. 81 (1943), upheld the validity oi curiew regulations

ImLosed unon japanese residing on the vest joast. The deiendant's

conviction under sec. Jia of tItle 18 vas all-rned without dissent,

E.O. 9U65 and the statute were each an exercise of the yuwer to

areas in question, at a tino of threatened air raids and invasion

by the japanese jorces, iron the sanger oi sabotage and espionage.

As to the attack on the curiew because it aenlied to catizens

oï the Unzied states lno vere oi Japanese ancestry and not to other

American citizens, the court rointed out the reasons why a

distinction could be raie, in tine oi var with Japan, between

citizens oi Japanese ancestry and other sitizens. It went on to

say that the circunstances justiried the military in believing

that restrictive nessures respecting Arerican citizens of

Japanese ancestry were urgent, and that the "zest alone that uttack on

our shores was threatened by Japan rather than another enemy cower

set

those citizens apart iron others who had no particular

associations with Japan. 3/ (p. 101).

The second case, Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214

(1944), involving the power to exclude United States

citizens

o1 Japanese ancestry iron areas designated under the statute and

Executive ürder, was decided in lavor of the government with one

justice iriting a corcurring opinion and three justides dissenting.

The deiendant was convicied oi remaining in such an area contrary

to the exclusion order oi the comnanding nilitary autnority.

The

majority opinion begins with a statenent that all legal restrictions

which curtali ine civi rigins vi a siugiu iñuial group a=s

immediutely suspect, but that that dues nut mean that they are all

unconstitutional singe iressing public necessity nay sometimes

justily their existence.

Exclusion from a threatened area in sar time

was held to have a cerinite and close relationship to the prevention

of espionage and sabotage, like the curren regulation involved in

the firakayashi cose. The court was not unmindiul of the hardships

imposed by the exclusion order upon a large group or American sitizens

but ielt that hardships are a part of war which leaves its impact

upon all citizens alike; while compulsory ecclusion oi groups of

citizens iron their homes is inconsistent with our basic governental

institutions exceet under circumstances of direst emergency and jeril,

nevertheless when under conditions of mocern warfare our shores are

threatened by hostile lorces the power to rrotect must be

commensurate with. the threatened danger.

The third case is Ex parte Erdo, 323 V.S. 283 (1944), which

mas unaninously dacided arainst the roverment, two justices

separately concurring Inis vas a habeas corrus case "nere the

petitioner, an American citizen vi Japanese ancestry, caallenged

The Court said thet tiss inco must be given her liverty since the

were concedingly loyal.

However, the court went no 'urther then thet;

deténtion in connection ith no phase of the evacuation program

would be lawul"; that it would assume thut "some such hower

night indeed. be necessary to the successial oreration oi the

evacuation program"; and that ior the purjoses ur this case

"initial detention in Relocation Centers nas authorized." Eence

this case very clearly recognizes that under sec. Ola Japanese

citizens could be detaized it they vere disloyal or while the

government was determiniss that question.

In the event of war with kussia Sec. 97a sbould ce

immediately utilized to set up a relocation procedure under which

Connunists would be dewined until such time as it might be

ascertained that the particular individual is not dangerous to

the government.

E.O. lo. 9066, supra, authorizing the

citizens and nationals oi the Union oi Suviet Socialist Republics,

and (2) to all persons who are now or have at any time in the

past been nembers oi the Communist Farty, or oi any party,

organization, lection or group which advocates the overthrow of

the government of the United States or adherence to the policios and

programs of its enemies.

The necessity for (1) is self-evident. Regarding (2),

it obviously cannot be linited to members of the Comunist Farty

since if a number or known Commu ists were detained it would

undoubtedly turn out that most of them were not actually members of

the Party at the tine or the detention.

As said above, Sec. 97s could be utilized in an

emergency as it nov stands.

Whether we should ask an amendment

at the present time, when reace is supposedly almost nere, is a

question of policy. In any event, the 7sth Congress is about to

adjourn and, unless a special session is called, nuthing could

be done looking toward new legislation until 1946. Ine important

thing at resent is that, ll' sudden trouble develops during

the adjourrment, sec. Sa can be tuilized until a special

session

or Congress can be convened.

However, its penel provisions becone

operative only unon the designation ol's military ares or zone

Current designations and restrictions were based upon the war

power; they will l'all cith the oificial termination oi the

to the Assistant Solicitor General, regardong the recomenaations

of the Interdepartmental Intelligence Comittee for legislation

dealing with the national security, that legislation might be

point here, Iur the use in question is

made an oilerse to lail to report toany relocation area, etc.,

In the indo case the Court left open the cuestion wether thet

would violate the statute in its present form. I also suggest

making violation oi the statute a felony instead of a misdemeanor.

II. Suspension of Frivilege of the

Virit oi rabeas Corpus

A consideration or this probler would hardly be complete

without some mention of the possible suspension of haleas corpus.

hile that has been done very rarely in ow history, and uncoubtedly

should not except in case or direst emergency, it may well be that

in another war conditions would be so difterent. Iron anything in

the past that the nost stringent steps should innediately le taizen.

such a suspension would emjover the goverament to detain anyone

non it desired, and rould make any new legislation unnecessary.

The Constitution, Article I, Sec. 9, clause 2, states that

"The privilere or the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended,

scept vinen in cases oi rebellion or invasion the public salety nay

equire it." The Constitution does not say that the privilege 5/

It would thus have been impossible to suspend habeas corpus in

the continental United States during World ar II.

That would not

be true in a l'uture war, however.

The United States would be

subject to attack by atonic and robot bombs, etc.; and while there

is dictum in Ex rarte illivan, 4 "all. 2, that the invasion must be

actual, under modern conditions bonbing attacks or the like would

certainly be considered a case of invasion witnin the neaning of

The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus nas been

extensively sustended only. twice in our history, except that

seneral andrew Jackson relused to nonor the urit irmediately. after

che battle o1 New Orleans in the war of 1812. M The important

occasions when the privilege was susrended were during the

Cival War in the United States and during World Har II in Fawaii.

During the Civil Far Fresident Abraham Lincoln suspended

the writ as early as April 1861, when he ordered the commanding

general of the Union Arny to do

Finally in serch 1863, Congress by

statute authorized suspension of habeas corpus, 8/ and pursuant

his last proclamation, srechlically relying

upon the statute, on September 15, 1663 (13 Stat. 7j4). But by

that time he had suspended nabeas corpus jur two years on his own

accord and without authority iron anyone; ior tho years he had

made arrests in thout varrants and held men in prison as long as he

• pleased; both or these being in flat disregard of Chief Justicy

Taney's ¿ecision in 1861 in the derryman case (17' Fed. Cas. lo. 5,487,

A good history of Liscoln's treatment, of the question

will be lourd in Sydney 5. Fisher's "The Suspension of Habeas Corpus

during the war of the Rebellion", 3 Pol, Sc. Q. 454 (1888).

During world ar II the rivilege was suspended in

Hawaii Iron Decenber 7, 1941, to October 24, 1944, urder the

section oi the Hawaiian Organic Act (48 U.S.C. 532) which empowers

the Governor to do so "in case of rebeilion or invasion, or

inminent aunger tnereof, when the public sarety derands it." /

The principal agitation

during the

Civil Ter contered on whether

the Fresident nieself could suspend the privilege or whether only

Congress could do so.

Thers is dictum in Ex parte Borlnan, 4 Granch, 75

¡soul), une siory sald in mis comentaries un ine couscicution

(Vol. 3,. Sec. 1336) that only Congress may susrend the privilege.

However,

Lincoln did not pesitate to take this step himself,

doubtless teeling that the necessity of the occasion justified his

action regardless of the views of legal authoritles.

Attorney General, Edward Bates, gave Lincoln an opinion in 1861

that the Fresident night suspend the privilege 1U/ and in several

Civil far cases the courts generally held that the privilege must

be suspended by Congress 1l/ although one court held to the

contrary. 1c/

'The reight of suthority holds that the President

cannot

suspend the privilere of hateas corpus, tut this is not

unduly inportent.

should the emergency be grave enough there

is enough authority to vrrant a fresidential suspension,

particularly il congress was not in session. however, a

statute should se sought as soon as the special session which

would' te called could cunvene; or il Congress ias in session when

the President acted it should be isked to ratify this action.

III. Conclusion

I have not attempted to cover in this memorandur the

possibility of martial law being declared. In the event or

hostilities with Russia martial law might be declared in sone

areas, il we were subjected to bumbing and sinilar attacks.

There would then be no problen of detaining comunists or anyone

else, since, of course, the civil courts would be closed and

civil law would be superseded by military lew.

In conclusion, my vier on this jeneral subject matter

is that, if relations with Russia become suificiently tad between

the convening of the next session o1 Congress, the

President may imediately invoke 18 U.S.C. Sec. 97a and,

through apropriate uruers ui une lat loparimaro, sun put inco

effect a relocation which would rally be a detention-progrem

for all Communists, whether or not imerican citizens.

Further, although suspending the privilege of the writ

öf habeas corpus

is a grave matter, conditions till now be dirferent

then ever belore.

The atonic bomb

alone makes a world of difference.

.. If we bresk with Russia we should forget rast concepts of

habeas corpus and traditional ideas regarding it and suspend the

privilege forthwith. Conditions will undoubtedly justily such

maction.

The suspension should be made by get of congress, but

II. the emergency arises during adjournment the Fresident will be

justiried in susrending the rivilege by ixecutive Order. His

action can ie ratiried by the special session which would be

irmediately called.

It is douitless too late to submit any amendments to

Sec. 97a to this session of Congress.

considered potentially dangerous to the national

defense and sublic safety of the United States.

Reference is made to your memorandum of May 11, 1951,

entitled as above, wherein you requested a definita expression

of the Department's opinion with respect

to the stanaeras, set,

out in your memoranda of Septenber 16, 1949 and July 27, 1958,

applied by the Bureau in deternining those individuals whose vest

or present activitles, or training, showed. them to be a potential

danger to this country in time of emergency so as to warrant their

inclusion on the Security Index:

HENN

As has been indicated in previous memoranda frou the

Department and pointed out aù conferences between Departient

representatives and those of the Bureau, the Department feels it

is advisable that, insofer as possible, the provisions of the

detention progran should parallel the provisions.of the. Emergency

Detention Act 011950. Accorsingly, it has ravised the security

Index standards so as to confor more closely to those of the act

and in so doing has to good extent utilized the language of the

statute.. Enclosed are copies of the standaras as so revised. i Tou

will note that in result the scope of the Bureau's standards is

not appreciably altered.

Inasmuch as the Department is now prepared to go forward

with the review of the Security Index, It ill appreciate receiving

your viers mith respect to the revised standaras at jour enrIlest

convenience.

In accordance with your request, you will be advised

In advance as to the attorneys who will be engaged in this work

and will also be advised as to the results of such

review in each

individual case as such reviews are completed. With the exception

of particular cases as to which you request special notification,

as illustrated by your memorandun of May 24, 1951, you are advised

that the Department presently contemplates first reviewing the files

on Federal Goverment enployees, including Atonic Inersy personnel,

who are included on the Security. Index.

Under date of May 22, 1951, a memorandum was addressed to

you in original response to your memorandun of May 11, 1951. It

has been pointed out that the language there emplosed is susceptible

to far broader interpratation than was intended. Accordingly, you

are advised that the Dapartment's memorandum of May 22, 1951, may

be disragarded.

the Attorney General on ApIll 1l, 1955, have been reviewed.

While no change appears necessary in the essential substance

of the criteria, the language used is in some respects uncleai

and possibly inconsistent. The proposed revisions set forth.

below are intended mainly to clarify what we understand to be

thê meaning of these criteria. These revisions are, of course,

subject to further change in the event that they do not accus-

ately, reflect the intended meaning.

It is noted that the present critaria do not contain

(and we are informed that there do not exist) formal defini-.

tions of the tems "basic revolutionary organization", 'revo-

lutionary groupi

, "Front osganizations"

, or "subversive

organization"

• While more precise indications of what is

meant by these terms would be desirable, we have not insisted

on formal definitions at this time in view of (1) the require-

ment that ary person actually detained will be entitled to a

hearing at which time the evidence will have to satisfy the

standards of $ 1 of PEAD 6 and the Emergency Detention Act, and

(11) the needed flexibility and discretion at the operating

level. in order to carry on an effective surveilance program.

The revisions recommended below have been drafted to

correct the following problems raised by the language of the

existing criteria:

(1) Paragraphs (a) and (3)

use the different terms

"basic revolutionary organization" and "revolutionary group,"

respectively, although we are informed that no differesce in

meaning is intended.

(2)

Under paragraph (b) it would be sufficient to ap-

prehend a person on the basis of "active substantial partici-

pation in the furtherance of the aims and purposes of the front

organization. "

Since it is one of the basic characteristics of

a front organization that its announced aims and purposes may

be wholly innocuous, or even praiseworthys it is conceivable

that some individuals might participate actively in (and sym-

pathize with) only those activities of a front organization.

that are related to unobjectionable purposes, and have no in-

volvement in those activities which relate to the aims and pur-

poses of a basic revolutionary organization. The detention of

such persons would not appear to be appropriate in the absence

of other considerations:

(3) Paragraph (c) is made applicable only to a person

who is

"not a member or a participant in the activities of a

subversive organization.

We have been informally advised by

the Internal Security Division, however, that the type of in-

.. dividual intended to be reached by this paragraph is likely to

•.

belong to some form of organization, though not one that meets

the standards of paragraphs (a) or (b).

(4) As it is presently worded, paragraph (d) can be in-

terpreted as being no more then a special, provision to include

individuals who otherwise qualify under one or more of para-

graphs (a), (b) or (c) except fox the fact that they have made

no overt acts or statenents within the prescribed five or three

year time linits. The Internal Security Division has informally

:: advised, however, that paragraph (d) is also intended to serve

as a catchall for certain individuals wiro do not meet the cri-

teria of paragrapns (a), (b) or (c).

Both paragraphs (c. and (d) apply on the basis of

the likelihood that the different categories of individuals

that they describe will perform undesicable acts in the event

of an emergency. No reason is perceived why paragraphs (c)

and (d) describe differently the undesirable acts that such

individuals may perform, as distinguished from the facts in-

dicating the likelihood that they will perform them,

or why such description should differ from that in s

SUBJECT: Campus Disorders

ATI, ISI INTERESA ME GOLDIES

DATE/01700 BUSHAMLI

The Internal Security and Criminal Divisions of the

'Department are jointly considering the possibility of conducting

a grand jury investigation of some future serious campus

disorder with a view towaids securing testimony and evidence

concerning violations of the seditious conspiracy (18 U.S.c.

2384), Smith Act (18 U.S.C. 2385), registration of certain

siganization= (Voorhis Act - 18 U.S.C. 2386), anti-riot

(18 U.S.C. 2101) and civil disorder. (18 U.S.C. 231) statutes

and any possible conspiracies in connection therewith.

In that regard, it would be most important for us to

secure in advance the names of any persons planning activities

which might fall within the proscription of any of the foregoing

statutes. It would also be important for us to know the

identities of the officials of any participating organizations

who have custody or control of records concerning the activities

of such organizations which we would seek to obtain by means of :

subpoenas duces tecum.

It would also be most helpful if you were able to furnis;,

" us with the names of any individuals who appear at more than one

campus either before, during, or after any active disorder of

riot and the identity of those persons from outside the campus

who might be instigators of these incidents.

We would, therefore, appreciate whatever action you can

take in obtaining information of the foregoing character, both

through your existing sources of information and through any

other sources you may be able to develop in those areas most

Ilkely to be productive of such information.

This will acknowledge your memorandum of September 30, 1971

regarding the effect that the repeal of Title II of the Internal

Security Act of 1950, as amended, has on the FBI's authority:

"to investigate subversive activities and related matters."

With respect to your initial inquiry, I wish to advise you

that the FBI's authority to investigate violations of the

espionage, sabotage, Smith Act, Atomic Energy Act and related.

statutes,

as well as subversive activities and related matters

in accordance with its statutory responsibilities and the

Presidential directivos, citca in your memorandum, remains

unaffected by the repeal of the Emergency Detention Act.

Furthermore, the repeal of the aforementioned Act does

not alter or limit the FBI's authority and responsibility

to record, file and index information secured pursuant to

its statutory and Presidential authority. An FBI adminis-

trative index compiled and maintained to assist the Bureau

in making readily retrievable and available the results of

its investigations into subversive activities and related

matters is not prohibited by the repeal of the Emergency.

to our national security.

With regard to Department instructions to the United States

RE: NEW LEST HOVEHENT

It is imperative to note the shilt to violence

in the New Left movement.

Sabotage, arson, bombing and a

variety of obstructive tactics have

been openly advocated

during the past year.

In September, 1968, within a five-day

period three ROIC establishments were sabotaged and a fourth

threatened.

In addition, a Central Intelligence Agency office

at Ann Arbor, lichigan, was

bombed during that month.

instances of openly made plans

for violence and the brazen

follow through of action

are examples of the problens facing

the Bureau in this field and the absolute need for intensive

investigative efforts in these matters. Successiul prosecution

is the best deterrent to such unlaviul

activity. Intensive

investigations of Key Activists under this Program are logically

expected to result in prosecutions under substantive violations

within the Bureau's investigative jurisdiction.

SYNOPSIS:

To advise of the results of New Left conference

with 12 key Special Agents in Charge (SAC) and their

supervisors at Seat of Government 12/6/68.

The purpose of the conference was to make attendees

personally aware of strong threat to. national security, also

to impress upon them the growing use of terroristic tactics

em not to na gho

on the part of New Leftists as shown by spreading incidents

of bombings and arsons. Further, the aim was to stress to

them the need to utilize manpower most effectively to combat

these activities. The SACs from Detroit and San Francisco

were called upon

to discuss in detail specific bombing

incidents perpetrated by New Left elements in their area to

illustrate how the hard-hitting investigative techniques

used are the most effective deterrent measures.

The determination was made the most effective

counteraction should involve concentration on Key Activists

in the New Left.

Various counterintelligence measures to

combat the New Left were explored. To insure most effective

utilization of manpower various streamlining measures were

discussed to obtain maximum investigative time and reduce

paper work. Conference vas highly beneficial to all

participants and specific recommendations and suggestions

made. These will be thoroughly reviewed and appropriate

Memorandum C.D. Brennan to W.C. Sullivan

RE: NEY LEFT MOVEMENT

DETAILS:

This is to advise of the results of the New Left

conference with 12 key SACs and their supervisors at Seat

of Government on 12/6/68. By memorandum of 11/7/68, the

Director approved bringing 12 key SACs with their appropriate

supervisors to Seat of Government for a conference.

The purpose of the conference was to make them

personally aware of the need for action, necessity of assigning

adequate personnel to these investigations and their respon-

sibility to give close attention to these matters to insure

positive results.

The conference was an open discussion between

participants. The over-all threat to our internal security

posed by the

New Left was defined and the shift to bombings

and arsons of Government tacilities was stressed. SACS

any Detroit, and on, San Francisco, gave in depth

discussions of recent New Left bombings in their divisions with

emphasis on the aeterrent eljects vi inru-hiiiing investigations

into the New Left movement.

The need for hard-hitting

investigations by the field and close personal supervision

by SACs Was clearly established. Extensive discussions were

held regarding

possible methods of reducing Agent time spent

on administrative matters and paper work with the objective of

giving maximum investigative time to the Agent commensurate

with our responsibilities

to supervise the field and disseminate

critical information to high Government officials and agencies.

The consensus of the conference was to concentrate

investigative efforts toward Key Activists in the New Left

movement with particular emphasis on developing evidence from

they may be successfully prosecuted.

Successful prosecution

remains the best deterrent to illegal activities. It was agreed

among participants taking Key Activists out of the New Left

movement by successful prosecutions would largely cripple its

effectiveness and more clearly establish its illegal and violent

nature to the public. The notoriety of the key leaders in the •

New Left and their seeming ability to flout the law has a

catalytic reaction among discontented and

restless youth that

cannot be allowed to continue.

Among the many suggestions and ideas exchanged, the

following specific recommendations have particular merit.

Memorandum C.D. Brennan to W.C. Sullivan

RE: NEW LEFT MOVEMENT

I) With the incoming Administration's expressed

interest in curbing lawlessness, it would appear a propitious

time to request a reaffirmation

of previous Presidential

Directives regarding the FBI's responsibilities in the internal

security field with particular emphasis on the subversive

threat of the anarchistic and violence-prone New Left.

Since

9/6/39, Presidential Directives have instructed the FBI to

investigate subversive matters; however, the New Left poses

new dimension in subversiveness and a strong forthright

Presidential Directive dealing directly with this problem

would give high level definition and focus to the problem.

2) Expansion of the existing Key Activist Program'

to include additional persons emerging in a leadership capacity

was considered essential, coupled with increased intensification

of our investigations of

them along lines detailed above.

Instituting a Key Activists Album containing a photograph

and

descriptive data of all Key Activists will materially aid

these investigations, particularly in following their

activities

between field offices.

Among possible streamlining measures considered to

afford additional investigative time to Agent personnel where

practical were the following:

1) Authorizing posting of channelizing memoranda

and other memoranda

to the file in internal security cases in

line with existing instructions in other security cases.

This

would eliminate a tendency on the part of Agents to send out

unnecessary correspondence to other field offices merely to

post a case.

2) Amending requirements for verification of residence

and employment when a subject is on both Agitator and Security

Indices

to insure there isno duplication of investigative efforts.

The above suggestions and recommendations will be

thoroughly reviewed as to their practicability and appropriate

recommendations made separately.

Many ideas

were expressed

and

discussed and they will undoubtedly have beneficial effects on

our investigations in this field in the future. Undoubtedly,

the biggest over-all benefit of the conference was the bringing

together of key personnel in a mutual exchange of ideas and

In that regard, it would be most important for us to

ReBulet 4/2/69 captioned "New Left Movement,

Internal Security - Miscellaneous (Key Activist Album)."

With the end of the Vietnam Har and Selective

Service Lottery System and reduced drafting of young men,

there has been a marked reduction in nationally known

agitators traveling about the country giving Inflammatory

speeches before large groups. There has been a corresponding

decrease in major disturbances. Some organizations of

national significance during the previous period of disorders

have become ineffective and other groups have emerged with

different tactics and leaders:

- на no.

The Key Activist Album has served as an invaluable

investigative aid to field offices covering subversives in

frequent travel status by making readily available photographs

and background information for use by Agent personnel on the

scene.

Because

subversive groups, particularly those

associated with New Left, are not particularly stable as to

leadership, there is a need for constant review of the

subjects included in the Album to insure there is a current

basis for their inclusion. Also there is a need for periodic

review of field office files to insure those subversives

emerging in leadership or activist roles are added to the

Album.

There are numerous well-known subversives who do not

have strong organizational affiliation but whose travel requires

coverage by the various field offices.

Offices should review logical files of those

subjects in which they are office of origin and who are

known to travel extensively for the purpose of recommending

for inclusion in the Key Activist Album those who warrant

the investigative attention required and whose presence in

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re:

Revolutionary

• Activities

Key Activists

of subversives who were known to travel extensively for the

purpose of recomnending these individuals for designation

as Key Activists.

No field offices subsequently recommended

additions to the Key Activist Album,

and at the present time

only 12 subjects are designated as Key Activists.

OBSERVATIONS:

Since the end of the Vietnam War and the draft,

the subversive movement has lost its "rallying point" and is

...in a fragmented state with little cohesiveness between

present day subversive organizations. This latter aspect is

certainly borne out by the Weather Underground's recent

the weather unc

publication of "Prairie Fire" in which they call for th

unifying of all revclutionary activists in

order to achieve

• their final objectives and goals; however, to date the

Weather Underground's call for such unification has failed

to achieve any success whatsoever.

Bureau teletype to all offices

and Legats, captioned

"Destruction of Field Files and Records," dated 1/29/75

instructed no FBI files or records maintained in the field

are

to be destroyed until further notification. Accordingly

recipients of attached airtel are

being instructed to maintain

their copies of Key Activist Album.

Forms FD-128 and FD-305 (attached) contain information

concerning Key Activists.

These references should

now be

deleted,as noted in line with discontinuance of Key Activist

program.

"..

RECOMENDATION:

1. That attached airtel be approved and sent to all

offices and designated Legats advising them of the termination

of captioned program..

2. This memorandum be referred to Training Division

so that

appropriate changes can be made in Forms FD-305

In January, 1968, FBI Headgnarters designated

instructed Key Activist subjects were to receive continuing

and

intensive investigation so that the Bureau would have

complete and detailed knowledge regarding their day-to-iay

This progran was later ezpanded to include all

Ileld offices and was invaluable at the time the "new Left"

movement was at its height.

At the time the Key Activist Program was

instituted, a numbei of individuals proninent within the

"New Left"

movement were making extensive public appearances

throughout the United States and abroad. During the course

of public appearances, these individuals were highly vocal

Re: Revolutionary Activities

Key Activists

Since the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam

and the ending of the draft, IBI investigations leave

litile doubt that the tactics of the subversive movement

have changed considerably; including diminished travel

throughout the United States and abroad.

This is borne

out by the field's inability to add qualified individuals

to the key Activist Album in response to referenced Bureau

letter.

Because of the above, Headquarters is of the

opinion the present day activities of subversive subjects

do not necessitate the continuance of this program.

Accordingly, captioned program is being terminated.

In

Line with Bureau relerine,

1/29/75 captioned "Destruction

of Field files and Records' all offices and appropriate

Legats should retain their copies of Key Activist Album.

Re: DOMINICAN INDEX

Mr.

Sullivan

A. Membership in a basic communist-type organization.

Bo Subject has served in a leadership capacity in a procommunist,

pro-Castro or communist-front organization or has had substantial active

participation in the furtherance of the aims and purposes of such an

organization.

Although not identified as a member of a subversive or front

organization, subject has, by public utterances and/or overt acts, shown

he adheres to communist doctrines and principles.

D. Although investigation has failed to establish overt acts or

statements on part of the subject, facts have been developed which clearly

and unmistakably depict subject as a dangerous procommunist individual..

Concerning the basic communist-type organizations hentioned in

Item A above, the Bureau considers, at present, as acceptable in this

category the vartido comunista Dominicano (IC) ~ Dominican Communist

Party) and the Movimiento Popular Dominicano (MPD - Dominican Popular

Movement): As additional information is gathered, additions may be made

-to these basic communist-type organizations.

OBSERVATIONS:

The Dominican Index is believed necessary at this time in order

to fulfill our responsibilities in the Dominican Republic. It

is

"believed that legat, Santo Domingo, should be armed with such an index

in order that he may have a complete run-down on those persons deemed

dangerous to the Dominican Government at all times.

RECONMENDATIONS:

That the Dominican Index be placed in effect and that Legat,

Santo Domingo, be advised of the mechanics to be utilized. In order that

we may proceed with implenentation of this index, there is attached

for approval:

(1) A form by which an index card may be prepared or amended.

II approved, form will bear number 5-146.

(2) A letter to legat,

• By memorandum 8/5/66 it was recommended and approved

that the Dominican Index (DI) be maintained for an additional

three-month period, at which time it should be re-evaluated.

We have made a re-evaluation and feel that the dI should now

be

limited in its scope. to include only the key figures among the

Dominican subversives.

BACKGROUND:

The DI is a ready record of individuals who should be

continually borne in mind from the

standpoint of the security of

the Dominican Republic (DR).

The DI was

established in November,

1965, to assist in fulfilling the

Bureau's mission in the Dr,

that of identifying Dominican subversives. It provides at a

moments notice,

through use of the data processing system, the

Identity ol those subversives deemed dangerous to the Dominican

Government.

It provides for the tabuiaiion of individuals

considered to be key

figures because of their position in the

Communist Parties, influence in education, labor, and so forth.

We have at this time over 960 individuals on the DI, of

which

over 250 are key figures.

CURRENT EVALUATION:

He have discussed this matter concerning the DI thoroughly

with Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, to obtain his views

as to

whether we should continue the DI

as in the past or to make

adjustments which would better serve his purposes. He havrialso.

discussed whether the DI should be discontinued.

Legal Attache feels that since his mission has now been

changed from an operational one to that of a strategic listing

post

for intelligence, the DI as originally instituted does not

meet his needs.

Since his efforts are now directed toward

gathering intelligence concerning the over-all Dominican situation

rather than the identification of individual subversives, he

believes the DI will be. of considerable assistance to him if

limited to the tabulation of key figures who are playing a prime

role in tha Dominican subversive movement.

RE: DOMINICAN INDEX

Our experience has shown that the capital city of

Santo Domingo is the hub of all political and subversive.

activity in the DR and it is on those key figures who exert a

significant influence on developments there that Legal Attache

will concentrate.

Accordingly, we will carefully go over names

currently designated as key figures on the DI to make certain we

• do not waste time and effort on the less important ones, many

of whom are located in rural areas of the DR. These names will

be eliminated as key figures.

Legal Attache has stated that by concentrating on

key figures and by utilizing the DI for tabulating purposes,

such will be of great assistance in his developing information

which will enable him to be well aware of just what is happening

in the DR from an over-all standpoint. As an example, he noted

the communist influence in the labor movement is worthy of

attention and that by concentrating on key Dominican subversives

active in this vital area, he will be able to closely follow this

area and spot the areas where the influence is greatest.

In connection with our re-evaluation of the DI, we

have taken due cognizance of the capabilities of nis current

permanent staff in order

to avoid bogging him down with

unnecessary paper work.

By limiting the DI to key figures only

we will be able to maintain this index with amnimum requirement

on Legal Attache, Santo Domingo.

We recognize that the key

figure list is presently composed of individuals who have come

to our attention as most important subversives in that country.

From time to time, some

of these individuals will become less

important and will be removed while other more influential

individuals will be coming to the Legal Attache's attention and

at that time will be placed on the DI.

The individuals currently on the DI who are not key

figures will be placed in a closed section so that if thé

situation flares up again we can, with a minimum of effort,

reactivate the DI for the purpose of identifying all subversives

if we are again called upon to become operational.

ACTION:

If you approve, we will continue to maintain the DI

but will limit its scope

to provide a tabulation of key figures

only. Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, will be appropriately advised.

*feel our staff in Santo Domingo can be reduced from two Agents and

two clerks to one Agent and one clerk with elimination of the

Dominican Index (DI).

When Dominican revolution erupted 4/24/65, our Government

had practically no verified intelligence data concerning DR

subversives.

Intelligence agoncies having responsibilities abroad

produced vuiy 77 nines of well-known communists,.

whereas

laterally

thousands of communists and other ieftists brought about the

critical

situation by taking advantage of an attempted coup.

When

the President ordered us into Santo Domingo in May, 1955, e-

pieceeded to compile information on persons who could be expected

to constitute a threat against established authority in future

energencies.

Drawing on Bureau's long experience in investigating

communists and cataloging them on our security index, we created

the DI and by Novenber, 1966, had listed over 980

potentially

dangerous Dominicans, as compared to the 77 known to the entire

U.S. intelligence community

a year and a half before.

When

our stats in Santo Domingo was cut back in accordance with desires

Memorandum for Mr. Sullivan

RE: OPERATIONS - SANTO DOMINGO

In view of forgoing, we feel we can discontinue main-

taining our DI. He can, of course, continue to beep record 0i

persons listed in the Di so it will be available should President

in the future order us again to become operational in santo

Domingo.

By doing this, we can cut back the work load in santo

Domingo

to point where

the office can be reduced. to a one-man,

one-clerks operation.

Following arrival of our first Agents in Santo Domingo

5/21/65, ow Stall Chere Increased InnedIatOly tO & COCal O1 11

Agonts and 10 clerks.

On 8/1/E6 Honorables

an advised

Assisiant to the Diroctor Cocks that the President desired us to

cut back to the nonoperational-type Legat office we maintain in

other foreign countries. There were then nine Agents in the Dr.

Four were ordored out innodiately and 30 days later tvo nore wére

cut from the staft.

That left us three Agents, and three cleiks

were assigned to the office on a permanont basis. On 2/19/68 we

further roduced the stail by one Agent und one clerical employee.

Ey cuiiing one additional Agont and clock at this time, ve can still

maintain the listening type post White House desires.

This vill

leave us with the necessary nucleus to

gear up again should the

President at a later dato feel the Doninican situation has changed

to point where

further FBi personnel are needed.

Il we discontinue our dI and reduce our staff as outlined

above, we must recognize ve will not be in a position in Santo

Domingo to produce general intelligence information to same extent

as in the past.

We now get such information from informants who

are contacied about di subjects.

Contacting then is time-consuning

and with only one agent available we will nave to retrench in general

Intelligence production. Then this occurs, however, we will be in

a position to discontinue the teletypo tie-line presently maintained

principally to expedite flor of intelligence to Bureau through

San Juan radio telctype facilities. The tie-line goes from Santo

Domingo.to.san Juan. Hereafter, Legat Hill use Bureau code and State

Department cable facilities.

ACTION:

Il approved, we will discontinue the DI but maintain

the listing for possible future use; issuc

ALL INFORMATION CONT FURi

DATE VIGO ON SEALE

The Dominican Index was discontinued May 23, 1968:

In the event there is a future need to reconstitute the

Dominican Index, single copies of two lists dated June, 1968,

are attached for inclusion in instant file. .One list is

captioned "Key Figures" and consists of 17 pages.

The

other list is captioned "Non-Key Figures" and consists of

31 pages.

Cards for individual subjects who had been included

on the Dominican Index are being filed in the case files

pertaining to such individuals.

Mr.

man, Voucher-Statistical Section,

Administrative Division, advised that if it were necessary

to reconstitute the Dominican Index on the Bureau's

automatic rata processing machinery this could be accomplished

from data reported on

the attached two lists and fron data

listed on the cards of the individuals no made up the

Dominican Index.

In this connection it is noted that the

cards contain information concerning such individuals that

was not included on the attached data processing lists.

One copy of each of the above two lists is being

maintained by the Section Chief, Latin-American Section,

and by the Supervisor in Charge of the South American-

Dominican Unit of the Latin-American Section. These lists

are being maintained as an investigative and an administrative

aid. They will be destroyed when it is determined they are no

longer useful.
