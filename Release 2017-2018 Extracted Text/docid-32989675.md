cases.

Bureau authority is requested to continue

investigation of

the NGP.

Bureau's attention is invited to the fact that

KARL HAND has placed major emphasis on the recruiting of

high school students, age 14 to 17, for the White Youth

Alliance.

In view of the above, Buffalo will not conduct

active investigation on individuals falling within the ages

of 14 to 17 without Bureau approval.

Although KARL HAND makes claims to a large

following, investigation has indicated that his claims

are greatly exaggerated and essentially without substance.

BLACK GUEKRILLA FAMILY

EM

The past several years has witnessed an increasing

number of acts of violence within the California prison

system.

Many of these acts have been perpetrated by members

of various groups formed vithin the prisons.

The forenost of -

these groups has been the Ülack Guerrilla Family (Gr), a

splinter group of the Black Panther Party, As has been

indicated in your recent comminications, more and more members

of the 3GI are being released from prison and there is

evidence that these releasees are being given assignments by the

BGE to carry out wen they return to outside life.

Our responsibilities for investigations of this group

and its members have been limited while its activities were

confined to the prisons. As more members are released, the

group poses a graver threat to the national security, and it is

incumbent upon us to be aware of any activity by the group out-

side the prisons. In order to accomplish this, it is necessary

to fully identify all members, be notified of their release and

to insure that thereafter all revolutionary and extremist

activities are followed and seported.

Re: Black Guerrilla Family

In line with the above, recipients should intensify

their investigations of the BGF and its splinter groups known

as Haunted Hunters, Baby Guerrilla Squad and Bunche Carter

Assault Squad. You should identify all members, ascertain

identities and locations of members who have been released

from prison, and establish a system whereby you will be

notified of future releases. You should determine whether

those already released are engaged in any activities

coming within the purview of the FBI's responsibilities.

As additional members are released, you should insure

activities are followed and reported.

Investigation of the organization, its activities,

identification of members and the reposting

; thereof should

be handled under the organization's case caption. Open

individual cases on all members as they are released and

report pertinent data developed under. the individual's case

The past several years has witnessed an increasing

number of acts of violence within the California prison

system. Many of these acts have been perpetrated by members

of various groups formed within the prisons.

The foremost of

these groups has been the Black Guerrilla Family (BGI), a

splinter group of the Black Panther Party. As has been

indicated in your recent communications, more and more members

of the 3GI are being released from prison and there is

evidence that these releasees are being given assignments by the

BGt to carry out when they return to outside life.

Our responsibilities for investigations of this group

and its members have been limited while its activities vere

confined to the prisons. As more members are released, the

group poses a graver threat to the national security, and it is

incumbent upon us to be aware of any activity by the group out-

side the prisons. In order to accomplish this, it is necessary

to fully identify all members, be notified of their release and

to insure that thereafter all revolutionary and extremist

activities are

followed and reported.

Re:

157-31288

In line with the above, recipients should intensify

their investigations of the BGF and its splinter groups known

as Haunted Hunters, Baby Guerrilla Squad and Bunche Carter

Assault Squad. You should identify all members, ascertain

identities and locations of members who have been released

from prison, and establish a system whereby you will be

notified of

future releases.

You should determine whether

those already released

are engaged in any activities

coming within the purview of the FBI's responsibilities.

As additional members are released, you should insure

activities are followed and reported.

Investigation of the organization, its activities,

identification of members and the reporting thereof should

be handled under the organization's case caption. Open

individual cases on all members as they are released and

report pertinent data developed under. the individual's case

caption.

All pertinent information developed in connection

with these investigations should be submitted to the Bureau

and interested offices in forn suitable. for dissemiration

along with your recommendations for further investigative

action.

U. So imperialism and national oppression. The name FEM

originates from a student sit-in occurring 2/1/60 at a lunch

counter of a store in Greensboro, North Carolina. This

sitin marked the beginning of a nationvide movement attacking

various forms of national oppression.

For additional information of recipients, an article

in the 3/5/75 issue of "The Guardian," a radical newspaper

published in New York, disclosed the

FTM has membership of

several hundred with chapters on more than 20 campuses, mainly

in the South and on the last Coast. This article disclosed

the IIM represents a merger of various ideological trends

in the black iiberation movement. It indicated that*

revolutionary nationalism, Pan-Africanism and Marxisn-Leninism

are united in the Fill around anti imperialism.

According to this article, the FIM is based in

Washington, D. C., and more information could be obtained by

writing the Fid,

₽. 0. Box 2200%, Washington, D. C. 20002.

• "The African World," identified as former organ of YOBU, was

described as the new organ of the FIM and the vehicle which

led to formation of the FEM.

The 2/21/75 issue of "The Militant," weekly newspaper

of the Socialist Workers Party, contained an article announcing

this conference included Owusu Sadaukai, Abdul. Alkalimat and

Eugene Locke, all national officers of the African Liberation

Support Conmittee (ALSC). This article referred to the FIli

as being organized in part by activists formerly associated

EXTREMIST MATTERS

Investigation in this matter is based on

intormation that leaders in this organization were,

and/or are leaders in extremist activities, including

those of the African Liberation Support Committee (ALSC) ,

and as such may be in violation of Iitle 18, United

States Code, section 2383 (Rebellion or Insurrection),

Section 2334 (Seditious Conspiracy), or 2385 (Advocating

Overthrow of the Government).

Sources have reported that the

African Liberation Support Committee

(ALSC) was «formed in July, 1912. Its

national headquarters is in Houston,

Texas.

In its statement of Principles

and Programs it defined the white

ruling class of the United States as

the cornerstone of world imperialism

and indicated that the ALSC's principal

tasks were 1) to merge the black

liberation struggles in the United

States and ifrica because a victory

over United States imperialism

anywhere is a victory everywhere

and 2) to unite blacks in an anti-

racist, anti-imperialist movement.

The actual location of this office is 473 Florida ivenue,

FEli literature dated March, 1975 furnished by a

three chapters in Washington, D.C. (WDC), one being at

organization.

In April, 1975, the first source reported that

although many former YOBU

members are currently associated

with the FIfi, the formation of this latter group was much

greater than a single changing of names. YOBU's aim was

to organize a political party and attempted to attract a

following from both students and community people. Thile

being very close in structure to the ALSC, the FEM

differs from that group in that the FFM is open strictly

to students, where the ALSC is open to all people.

Currently the FFM has no

announced ongoing programs, as

it is very young and developing. It encourages its

members to attend functions of the ALSC and other anti-

imperalist groups.

source one continued that during the summer of

1974, in an effort to organize a successful, meaningful

appeared to function better. Source's opinion, formulated

by personal conversation with several FEM leaders, was

that no knom foreign influence of any kind éxists

is true, in that the group is operated by its leaders,

who use

Philadelphia,

This investigation is based on information MOVE

may be in violation of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 2383

(Rebellion or Insurrection), Section 2834

(Seditious

Conspiracy), and Section 241 (Conspiracy to Deprive a

•Citizen of Rights or Privileges secured by the Constitu-

tion or the Laws of the United States) .

Sources, who have furnished reliable information

in the past and the Philadelphia Police Department (PHPD) ,

described MOVE as a bi-racial organization whose aim is tog

MOVE the establishment to their way of thinking which is

that no one should own too much.

They do this by demonstra

ing against and attempting to interrupt well known person-

alities when they are speaking by shouting obscenities to

attract attention.

They have shouted these obscenities

before the Philadelphia Board of Education, colleges,

Governors of the 13 original states, and attempted to do so

before President FORD.

PHPD advised they feel the greatest

danger in these outbursts is the possibility of MOVE mem

bers being atacked by someone who considers their profanity

repugnant.

This could lead to a riot when other MOVE members

attempt to help their friends. MOVE is Philadelphia based

and the PHPD advised that they know of no MOVE organization

outside of Philadelphia.

to be a dangerous group in that they are so obnoxious every

time there is a demonstration or any MOVE members are

MOVE members, hoping they will "not throw the first punch."

Inspector FENCL advised typical of the attitude

Of MOVE occurred during the Bicentennial Celebration of

the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia at Car-

*ti

penter Hall.

There were 12 governors and a lieutenant

governor of the 13 original states. When the governor

of New Hampshire began speaking they were spread through-

out the audience and all screamed obscenities at the

they screamed these obscenities at judges and they feel

they are being picked on by the judges because the judges

hold them in contempt.

PH 1068-E and PH 4384-PEI advised there are 30-35

members of MovE They to low the writings of "JOHN AFRICA"

and state tis Philadelphia is the homebase of MOVE. They

say MOVE is located in other areas but there is no indication

this is so.

PH 1068-E on 12/20/74, advised he had been in

contact with members of MOVE organizations and found it

practically impossible, to reason with them.

(PH™ 1068-E/ described

MOVE as a "quasi-militant

group of rather articulate individuals" who seek to make

"revolution" through social adjudication and disruption,

through chailenging elected officials, and otherwise

harassment of law officers and members of the judicial

system.

Everyone who has had anything to do with MOVE

has commented on their filthy clothes and the fact they

feel it is wrong to take a bath.

PH 4384-REIadvised most MOVE members are ex-

tremely dedicated.

They consider. a sign of dedication how

many times one has been arrested, creating a disturbance,

and how many wounds a member has received from the clubs

noise they have been making is merely an attention getter so

they will become known and gain adherents to their cause.

For the information of the Bureau, Philadelphia

has one informant, a member of MOVE, and the second infor-

mant who is in contact with MOVE members.

It is felt this

organization should be reviewed and at least the leaders

of the organization identified.

Members of MOVE reside at 309 North 33rd Street,

Philadelphia, a dilapidated house.

PH 4384-PEI advised

most MOVE members work at a car wash in front of the house

and through this car wash, make some money.

Memvers of MOVE have been interviewed by agents

handling extremist matters and agents handling civil rights

cases when they came into the Philadelphia Office to com

plain that their civil rights were violated when they were

arrested by the police.

Philadelphia will continue this

type of interview so that consideration can be given toward

obtaining more informants in MOVE.

UACB, Philadelphia will continue its investigation

of MOVE and members of MOVE. IHM concerning MOVE will be

submitted in the near future.

Extra copies of instant communication are being fur-

nished to you for inclusion in your tiles on the above persons.

Ior your future guidance, the letters on each of the

above individuals were submitted under the alias of each, with

the true names shown as aliases.

Future correspondence should

be in proper form under true names of subjects.

NOTE:

All five of the investigations of above individuals

were predicated upon involvement in Move by the individuals.

Move is described in the letter as a "biracial organization

whose aim is to MOVE the establishment to their way of thinking

that no one should own too much.

They do this by demonstrating

against and attempting to interrupt well-known personalities

when they

are speaking by shouting obscenities to attract

attention." The predications go on to name instances where Move

has shouted obscenities

and it. ends up with the belief that

attacks on Move members by persons who consider their profanity

repugnant, could lead to riots.

relative to those comments.

For future guidance, since investigation of MOVE was

initiated in March, 1974, as indicated in above-mentioned

memorandum, basis for the investigation should have been set

out not only in your file upon initiation of investigation

but. should have also been included in a communication to FBIHQ

after the investigation had extended beyond the preliminary

90-day investigative stage. No such communication under the

MOVE caption was submitted until prompted by Buaistel to your

MOVE

This investigation is based on information

MOVE may be in violation o1 Title to

U.s. Code,

section 2383 (Rebellion or Insurrection), Sectior

2834 (seditious Conspiracy), and Section 241 (Con

spiracy to Deprive a Citizen of Rights or Privileges

Secured by the Constitution or the Laws of the United

States) .

As BACKGROUND

A source described MOVE as a "quasi-militant

groun of rather articulate individuals". He stated the

organization consists of 30 to 35 persons who seek to

make "revolution" through social agitation and disrup

tion, through

he challenging of elected officials,

otherwise harassment of law officers and members of th

judicial system.

According to the source, MOVe surfaced in the

late fall or early winter of 1973 and stated they were

following the writings of "JOHN AFRICA", the founder of

MOVE.

MOVS claims that man's technology has "doomed"

him and

that they are therefore against machines, science,

mechanization, etc.

Letter to Philadelphia

Re: MOVE

157-33717

Although no investigation is to be conducted of

MOVE and no informants targeted against this organization,

Philadelphia should submit in appropriate form for

dissenination any situations involving MOVE coming to your

attention that come within our responsibilities concerning

Civil Unrest. This would include proposed or actual

demonstracions or confrontations that might lead to or do

Involve violence. Any such items should carry the Civil

Unrest character.

NOTE:

MOVE is an organization of approximately 30-35

members located in Philadelphia and in existence since early

• 1973. Its members engage in shouting obscenities in public

meetings thereby disrupting prominent, often elected, speakers

and leading to arrests of MOVE members. In court proceedings

MOVE members behave in the same manner resulting in

declaration of mistrials and subjects' being sentenced for

contempt of court. MOVE members refuse to bathe and are

totally obscene in their personal behavior.

There is no

indication of a statutory basis for our continued investigation

of this organization and Philadelphia is being instructed to

discontirue.

described Move as a bi-racial organization whose aim is tol

that no one should own too much.

They do this by demonstra

Governors of the 13 original states,

before President FORD. PIPD advised they feel the greatest

danger in these outbursts is the possibility of MOVE mem-

bers being atacked by someone who considers their profanity

repugnant.

This could lead to a riot when other MOVE members

attempt to help their friends. MOVE is Philadelphia based

and the PHPD advised that they know of no MOVE organization

to be a dangerous group in that they are so obnoxious every

time there is a demonstration or any nove members are

present, the PHPD is always afraid of trouble with the

MOVE members, hoping they will "not throw the first punch."

Inspector FENCI advised typical of the attitude

of MOVE occurred during the Bicentennial Celebration of

the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia at Car-

penter Hall. There were 12 goveriors and & lieutenant

governor of

the 13 original states.

When the governor

of New Hampshire began speaking thsy were spread through-

out the audience and all screamed coscenities at the

governor from Wew Hampshire.

In courtroons then on trial,

they screamed these obscenities at juages and they feel

they are being picked on by the judges because the judges

hold them in contempt.

iNfORmANTS

advised there are 30-35

members of MOVE.

They follow the writings of "JOHN AFRICA"

and state ta Philadelphia is the homebasc of MOVE. They

say MOVE is located in other areas but there is no indication

this is so.

iNfoRMANT on 12/20/74, advised he had been in

contact with mempers of MOVE organizations and found it

practically impossible to reason with them.

iNFORmANT described MOVE as a "quasi-militant

group of

rather articulate individuals" who seek to make

"revolution" through social adjudication and disruption,

through challenging elected officials, and otherwise

harassment of law officers and members of the judicial

system.

Everyone who has had anything to do with MOVE

has commented on their filthy clothes and the fact they

feel it is wrong to take a bath.

iNfORmANT

advised most MOVE members are ex-

tremely dedicated. They consider a sign of dedication how

many times one has been arrested, creating a disturbance,

and how many wounds a member has

received from the clubs

a policemen.

On 1/30/75 iNfoRmANT advised MOVE is an OI-

ganization that advocates nothing less than the total overthrow

of the existing government.

He stated that the non-violent

noise they have been making is merely an attention getter so

they will become known and gain adherents to their cause.

For the information of the Bureau, Philadelphia

has one informant, a member of MOVE, and the seconä infor-

• mant who is in contact with MOVE members. It is felt this

organization should be reviewed and at least the leaders

of the organization identifiea.

Members of MOVE reside at 309 North 33rd Street,

Philadelphia, a dilapidated house. PH 4384-PEI advised

most MOVE members work at a car wash in front of the house

and through this car wash, make some money.

Menivers of MOVE have been interviewed by agents

handling extremist matters and agents handling civil rights

cases when they came into the Philadelpnia Office to com

plain that their civil rights were violated when they were

arrested by the police.

Philadelphia will continue this

type of interview so that consideration can be given toward

obtaining more informants in MOVE.

UACB, Philadelphia will continue its investigation

of MOVE and members of MOVE. IHM concerning MOVE will be

submitted in the near future.

According to the source, kove surfaced in the

MOVE

Inspector FENCI advised that many l10VE

members have been arrested.

but that very lew have

been convicted because most every trial involving a

MOVE member has ended in a mistrial.

However, judges

have sentenced MOVE members to up to 120 days

prison for Contempt of Court.

An example of this and an example of the

attitude of MOV members occurred during the Bicen-

tennial Celebration of the First Continental Congress

in Philadelphia on September

There were

Governors of 12 of the original 13 states and the

Lieutenant Governor of the 13th representing their

states

at this celebration.

Governor SHAPP Of Penn-

sylvania was the Master of Ceremonies as Host Governor.

Governor SHAPP spoke and then introduced the Governor of

New Hampshire.

MOVE members

who were spread through

out the audience, began shouting at the top of their

lungs, using obscene language.

They were taken from

the celebration, arrested and later brought to trial.

it their trial they cursed and

swore at the juage,

police ofricers and anyone who testifled against them.

The judge ruled the case a mistrial anâ sentenced all

involved to three months for Contempt of Court.

According to Inspector latch. this is typical

of what happens in court trials involving MovE members.

The biggest trouble at these trials occur when a person

is upset at the antics of some of the MOVE members and

attempts to hit them.

While in jail, MOVE members have

refused to leave jail when a release

is issued because

they want to stay with their friends. Inspector FETCL

advised that jails have many problems with MOVE members

because MOVE members do not bathe and at one time com

plained

that they did not want anyone killing the bugs

in their cell.

C. POTITICIA FOR VIOLICE

Inspector Faich stated that in and of them-

selves

"OV3 members are not violent and would not

attompt to cause problems

except for their language

and attempts to stop speakers at reguLar meetings.

Inspector FENCI stated that the most important pro-

sLem with OVe members would occur at demonstrations

such as that mentioned above when someone may get dis-

gusted with the obscenities and actions of MOVE members.

An individual night hit one of them and a riot could

then start.

Hove meniers would then attempt to protect

their on and everyone else would be against the

member.

un January 30, 1915, the secona source

advised that 0VE is an

organization that advocates

ching less

thon the total overthrow of the existing

ivernment.

He stated the non-violent noise MoVa has

in making is merely an

attention getter

so they

will become know and gain adherence to their cause.

This source was recontacted and stated he came to this

opinion from writings and statements of MOVE members.

The writings and statements contain nothing which

would lead one to believe there is a plot to destroy

the government. Since MOVE advocates doing away vith

=--=

all scientific and other type companies, one could

casily obtain the viewpoint of this source."

In April 23, 1975, the second source advisec

that in reaction to the boatings and other abuse that

Hove members have received, they, some Hove menber

formed a group known as the "Black Guarä" .

RePHairtel and IHM dated 6/3/75.

The following portions have been deleted from

Bureau copies of referenced IHM inasmuch as these

statements appear to be the opinion of the dictating

Agent and not attributable to a source:

The entire second and third rentences of

paragraph 4, page 2.

The last sentence of paragraph 2, page 4.

Delete from your coples.

Careful review of che information contained in

à referenced Ill by FBILQ indicotes that there is no basis

for a continued investigation of MOVE or of its members

because of their association with MOVE. It is recognized

that the behavior of MOVe members is very undesirable

and disruptive of public gatherings and trials. Their

disruptive acts, however, are violations of state and

local laws and apparently are being dealt with on that level

by the proper authorities.

number and there is no indication that it is expanding

beyond- Philadelphia.

In view of above, Philadelphia should discontinue

its investigation of this organization in the absence

of indications that its nembers are involved in activities

related to violations of Federal statutes.

Letter to Philadelphia

Re: MOVE

157-33717

Although no investigation is to be conducted of

MOVE and no informants targeted against this organization,

Philadelphia should submit in appropriate form for

dissemination any situations involving Movi coming to your

attention that come within our responsibilities concerning

Civil Unrest. This would include proposed or actual

denonstrations or confrontations that might lead to or do

involve violence. Any such items should carry the Civil

Unrest character.

NOTE:

MOVE is an organization of approximately 30-35

members located in Philadelphia and in existence since early

• 1973. Its members engage in shouting obscenities in public

meetings thereby disrupting prominent, often elected, speakers

and leading to arrests of MOVE members. In court proceedings

MOVE members behave in the same manner resulting in

declaration of mistrials and subjects' being sentenced for

contempt of court. MOVE members refuse io bathe and are

totally obscene in their personal behavior. There is no

indication of a statutory basis for our continued investigation

of this organization and Philadelphia is being instructed to

discontime.

Dear friend:

Roxbury, Massachusetts 02120

The Camittee Against Racism (CAR) is organizing Boston Freodon Summer '75,

a counteroffensive against the racist forces in Boston, and we need your help.

CAR is an intemational, multiracial organization actively fighting racisn in

education and other important areas of life. We believe that racism hurts us

all--black, white, latin, Asian and native American--because it prevents the

unity we all need

to work for social change.

Boston has become the national center of a new wave or racism that is sweeping

the country. If the racist movement in Boston, led by powerful and influential

politicians, gues unchallenged, it can move the entire country in a fascist-

Like direction.

This is why CAR is organizing hundreds of volunteers from all over the country

for a summer of intensive anti-racist activity in Boston.

These volunteers

will work with a broad range of local groups, canvass door-to-door in the

city's neighborhoods, distributa leaflets, hold rallies and demonstrations.

The goal is to undermine the political base of the racists and create a vigor

ous anti-racist, multi-racial movement which will fight for improved education

for all school children.

We in Boston CAR, and the sumer volunteers, need your help NOW. You and/or

your organization can:

---Frovide housing for one or more volunteers from out of town for all or

part of the summer.

-Sponsor an anti-racist volunteer for the summer by raising $200 or more.

---Contribute funds for literature, office expenses, mailing costs, etc.

---Invite a speaker from CAR to address your organization, class, and/or

group of friends and neighbors in your home about the Surmer Project.

--farticipato yourseli by helping us organize for the project, by suggesting

groups we can contact, and by introducing your imenas to ur.

A Call to Action - The International

Committee Against Racism

The Steering Committee of the International

Committee Against

Racism (CAR) Calls on

students and other interested people to join our

Freedom Summer Anti-Racist Action Project. Its

purpose js to give a national/international focus

to the anti-racist struggles going on in Boston.

Summer volunteers will work under the leadership.

of Boston CAR. Together, they will prepare the

way for a strong people's movement which will

unite blacks, whites, and other minorities to fight

for quality, desegregated education and to fight

against the racism being used to wreck the bussing

program.

This struggle will have a programmatic focus.

Our aim is to select seriously committed people,

students and others, but especially students, who

will work on commuter campuses.

Student

volunteers must register at these schools in order

to be effective. Some people may get jobs. A few

may be assigned to community organizations.

Other will talk to workers at plant gates and in

union halls. The main focus will be on working

with Boston students, parents, and teachers espec

ially those from ethnic communities like South

Boston and Roxbury.

A CAR sub-committee (Boston '75)

will coor-

dinate all activities. Two one-week

anti-racist

schools will be opened June and July with weekly

workshops to prepare our volunteers for the

correct ways of interacting with the Boston

community. The key strategy is alliances with

existing, rank-and-file forces already mobilized

against racist attacks. The result will be solid,

citywide CAR chapters and other rank-and-file

anti-racist groups, tremendous experiences for our

volunteers, and CAR itself will grow. Only in such

a, united,

rank-and-file,

multiracial, mass

movement can we defeat racism-in Boston and

everywhere.

WHY IS BOSTON FREEDOM

SUMMER '75 SO IMPORTANT:

Because the power structure has kept Boston in

a turmal. Anti-racist actions, are swept under the

• rug, while pro-racist activity resembling fascism, is

given

top billing. Boston

is

the

ternational/national expression of racist ideas

published by Jensen, Herrnstein, and Banfield to

justify the failures of the System. Further Boston

racists are totally organized by political forces

more dangerous than those in the South. The

school board, the President, other politicians, and

even the U.S. Supreme Court abet the resistance.

Moreover, racism is preventing working and

middle-class people from getting a decent school

system to replace a poor one. Racism is keeping

blacks, whites, and other people from fighting

back against unemployment, the cutbacks which

are ruining health, education, and welfare in the

Boston area. Boston Freedom Summer '75 will

help many white Bostonians especially to begin to

understand that racism hurts them. That without

multiracial unity, there is no decent life for

anyone. CAR BELIEVES THAT WE CAN REACH

THE SILENT MAJORITY OF WHITE ANTI-RACIST

AND BRING THEM-INTO OPEN STRUGGLE. By

hindering the attempt to create even further racial

turmoil around the 75-76 bussing program, we will

greatly improve our chances of creating an in-

ternational movement against racism.

MOST OF ALL, Boston is the test whether or not

racist mob-violence, similar to FASCISM, com-

bined with political

racism can succeed, in

stooping the desesration movement. CAR savs

with this summer project, "THE RACISTS ARE

GONNA FLUNK THIS TEST!!!"

BOSTON '75:

A Call to Action- The International

Committee Against Racism

The Steering Committee of the International

Committee Against Racism (CAR) calls on

students and other interested people to join our

Freedom Summer Anti-Racist Action_ Project. Its.

purposejs to give a national/ international focus

to the anti-racist struggles going on in Boston.

Summer volunteers will work under the leadership.

of Boston CAR. Together, they will prepare the

way for a strong people's movement which will

unite blacks, whites, and other minorities to fight

for quality, desegregated education and to fight

against the racism being used to wreck the bussing

program. -

This struggle will have a programmatic focus.

Our aim is to select seriously committed people,

students and others, but especially students, who

will work on commuter campuses.

Student

volunteers must register at these schools in order

to be effective. Some people may get jobs. A few

may be assigned to community organizations.

. Other will kalk to workers at plant gates and in

union halls. The main focus will be on working

with Boston students, parents, and teachers espec

ially those from ethnic communities like South

Boston and Roxbury.

A CAR sub-committee (Boston '75)

will coor-

dinate all activities. Two one-week anti-racist

schools will be quened June and July with weekly

workshops to prepare our volunteers for the

correct ways of interacting with the Boston

community. The key strategy is alliances with

existing, rank-and-file forces already mobilized

COTTEE AGAINST RACISM

IS-CAR

00: BALTIMORE

Re Baltimore letter dated 3/18/75.

The Committee Against Racism (CAR) in Baltimore has

continued to support forums and educationals concerning racism

within the existing educational systems.

It is noted that CAR in Baltimora has been supported

by elements of the Progressive Labor Party, a Baltimore chapter.

in their activities.

As stated in referenced letter, this sup

port by

the Progressive Labor Party (PIP) is done because CAR

and Put are in sympathy regarding their views concerning racism.

Investigation to date does not develop any attempt

by the PLP to recruit members from CAR or to influence the

members towards Pul's, philosophical vievpoints:

CAR has no recognized membership and participants in

meetings vary.

Baltimore Division has placed this investigation in a

closed status until it becomes evident at a later time that defi

nite attempts have been made by subversive groups to corrupt

CAR or its members.

CAR's activities continuing to center around social

action against racism.

COMMITTEE AGAINST RACISM

WASHINGTON, D. C., CHAPTER

Apparent Origin of the Committee Against Racism,

Washington, D. C. Chapter

On March 5, 1972, a group of approximately twenty-

five persons met at the residence of Mike and Deirdre Golash,

1673 Columbia Road, N.W.,. An organizational designation could

not be attached to

the

group; however, the persons present

were primarily washington, D. C., area college students who

were members of the Progressive Labor Party and/or the

Students for a Democratic Society. The meeting convened to

discuss methods of exposing racism and racist practices in

various area college campuses.

Suggested methods to accomplish these ends which

were discussed at the meeting included (1) supporting strik-

Ing campus workers, (2) exposing racist professors, and (3)

banning books that

advocate the belief that Blacks

are

Inferior to Whites.

WF T-1, 3/5/72

The Progressive Labor Party (PLP), which

was founded in 1965, adopted a constitutior

which "resolved to build a revolutionary

movement" and "build a socialist USA with

all power in the hands of the working

people." PLP followed the Chinese communist

line for several years but became critical

of Chinese leaders for establishing a

dialogue with the U.S. following President

Nixon's visit to China in 1972.

Thereafter,

PLP declared itself to be an independent

Marxist-Leninist organization aimed at

setting up a dictatorship of the working

class.

According to Milton Rosen, National

Chairman, the PLP advocates violent over-

throw.

The PLP

25 cities in

the U.S., and has, in the

past year, initiated efforts to make PLP

and undergraduate students.

It was formed in 1972 to work

against the resurgence against racism in higher education

and in society generally.

CAR chapters throughout the country set April 19-22,

1974 as the dates for a major national action/conference to

combat racism in education, medical care, and medical research.

The main focus of the action was to be a lobbying rally in

Washington, D. C.; however, small, local activities in other

locations around the U. S. were also planned. The following

was a schedule: (1) a march and demonstration of the White

House on Saturday, April 20, (2) workshops at American

University on Sunday, April 21, (3) lobbying in Congress on

Monday, April 22.

The April 20 demonstration planned opposition to

the recent Committee on Economic Development (CED) report,

which calls for doubling of tuition and reduction of finan-

cial aid by state institutions of higher education,

for Black and working class students, and virtual elimination

of job security through tenure for new faculty. An additional

focus of the CAR action would involve opposing the recent CED

plans for turning state colleges into primarily centers for

technical and occupational training. Also the demonstration

would oppose continuing government funding of racist research

projects.

COMMITTEE AGAINST RACISM,

Aims and Objectives of the CAR

CAR members nationwide are watching closely a case

currently pending before the U. S. Supreme Court. The out-

come of the case will have a profound effect in supporting

or undermining one of CAR's basic alms: to oppose the reliance

by society on culturally based aptitude and achievement tests

In determining opportunity and reward in American life.

The case involves a lawsuit by a white student

against the University of Washington Law School. The student,

Marco DeFumis, has charged the law school with

crimination" because it denied him admission, but admitted a

number of black and Spanish-speaking students who had lower

scores than his on the Law School Aptitude Test.

CAR has emphasized strongly the fallacy of relying

on such standardized tests as the only or main criterion for

determining. college, graduate school, or law school admission,

job opportunities, and so on.

A• number of leading scholars have also questioned

the validity of such tests, pointing out that they are de

signed by members of the dominant (white) culture, and empha-

size a particular class outlook. Therefore, people who come

from that culture, and who have

that class outlook, would

normally make higher scores on them than would people who

come from other cultural and class backgrounds.

Antioch Law School has submitted an "amicus curiae"

(friend of the court) brief on behalf of the Univeristy of

Washington Law School. A number of other organizations such

as the United Auto Workers and United Mine Workers are also

supporting the school.

The high court, eight of whose nine members are

white, should hand down a decision in the case later this

• term.

CAR also opposes the use of public tax money to

support the promotion of theories of racial, social, or class

inferiority.

Such theories have been cited

in attempts to

justify currently existing social conditions and the unequal

distribution of wealth among people.

Says: STOP RACOT

HARRASSMENT IN

FRANTISCO!

On Wednesday, 150 special San Francisco police, urged on-by Mayor

Alioto (a prime gubernatorial candidate): began a massive campaign of

street searches and car stoppayas of black male suspects in an "attempt"

to apprehend a, "Zebra" (black on white?) killer(s), accused of murdering

13 whites and wounding 7 others. The "Zebra" killings have been used

by the press and the police to create a wave of racist hysteria in the city.

Hundreds of black men fitting the vague description of. the suspect--.

20 - 30 years old, 5'9" - 6^ tall-nave been repeatedly stopped, some

three or four times, for as long as 30 minutes.. This tactic is unprece-

dented in a murder investigation and amounts to nothing more than racist

harrassment of the black population of San Francisco and an attempt to

promote fear and suspicion of blacks by whites.

At a time of serious inflation and économic rezession when the

standard of living of all working people, white and non-white, is drastically

falling, the U.S. power structure has been using racism as its major tool

to divide and conquer working people in this country.

If we are to achieve a better life for all of us, people of all races

nust unite and fight to defeat the deadly poison of racism.

1. Free tuition financed by federal funds at all public colleges and universities.

2. Federally funded financial aid for students at all public colleges and universities

adequate to support them in a decent manner, and based on economic need.

3. Federal funds for the hiring of more faculty and staff at all public colleges and

• universities in order to expand educational opportunities.

4. Federal funds for both open admissions programs and the supporting educational

facilities required to make them constructive for the students.

5. Recognition of the right of all faculty to job security in the form of tenure after a

reasonable trial period.

6. Expanded aftirmative action designed to guarantee the hiring of faculty and staff.

and the admission of students from among Black, Latin, Asian, and Native Amer-

icans, and women.

7. Increased federal funding for public school systems of a magnitude sufficient to

reverse the current disastrous downward trend in the quality of public education.

class of people is inferior to another. .

-PETITION TO CONGRESS

The Committee for Economic Develonment (CED), an influential organiza-

tion that is composed primarily of big-business spokesmen but includes leading

academic figures, has proposed a plan for higher education. This plan, if im-

plemented, will lower the quantity and quality of education available to most

people and further institutionalize racism in our colleges and universities.. In--

deed, signs of its implementatinnihad lindy entagen: the City recommen-

dations and their effects may be summarized as follows.

First, to drastically increase the already prohibitively high tuitions at uni-

versities. Traditional programs of higher education leading to professional ca-

reers will thus become the exclusive province of the higher income strata of

society. All universities will become as inaccessible as Harvard, for example,

is today to those from low income backgrounds, who in our society consis dis-

proportionately of Black, Latin, Asian, and Native Americans.

- Second, to institute what the CED calls "new types of curricula" and a "wider

diversity" of institutions supposedly designed to better serve "the nation's varied

manpower requirements." To implement this, state and community colleges will

in essence be converted into vocational training schools. The few opportunities

for the traditional programs of higter education which remain-r' low income

people will effectively be cut off. All that will remain will be an invidious educa-

-

unal system in which the wealthy are tracked into the profession; and low in-

come white people as well as Black, Latin, Asian, anç' Native American people

are systematically excluded from professional training. A society in which oppor-

tunities are restricted on racial and class lines will thus become even more firm-

ly solidified.

Third, to impose 50% tenure quotas and periodic tenure review on faculty.

This attack on tenure is masqueraded as an attempt to improve educational stand-

ards; it will actually destroy all gains made in faculty working conditions during

the last twenty years. Job security will arbitrarily be denied to half the member-

ship of the academic professions. This can only have a disastrous effect on

teaching and research programs, and must discriminate against newly hired faculty

many of whom belong to oppressed groups that have only recently opened a crack

in the barriers to their participation in these professions.

Fourth, the recommendations in the CED report will, if implemented, make

public policy of racist theories like those of CED Research Advisory Board mem-

ber Edward Banfield (The Unheavenly City), Arthur Jensen (Educability and Group

Differences) and Richard Herrnstein (IQ in the Meritocracy). Their false theses

that Black and poor white people are genetically or culturally inferior serve to

justify poverty and uncqual opportunity on racial and class lines.

cuttacks, justiied by the racist doctrines cited above,

are throwing white teachers as well as black teachers

out of work at a depression pace.

These are examples of how racism damages the

economic well-being of all of us. But racism damages

every one of us in still another important way. It disarms

us politically. It divides black and while so that we are

hampered in our fight to win a decent way of life. We

• fight at half strength. And wily? Because the racist

thecrizing we have pointed to and which the govern-

mentsupports, ihe universities cloak with respectability,

and the public schools spread far and wide, forces us

to fight among ourselves. Meanwhile, our schools get

worse, our health care deteriorates, and our jobs disap-

pear. These altacks on our well-being, on our economic

and cultural lives, can only be reversed if all of us-

blacis, white, red, brown, and yellow-are politically

united and'in trim for a counter offensive.

These are the reasons why it is crucial for all of us to

fight racism.

Join us in the Spring Action.

Apparent Origin of the Committee Against Racism,

Washington, D. C., Chapter

On March 5, 1972, a group of approximately twenty-

the group; however, the persons present

were primarily Washington, D. C. area college students who

were members of the Progressive Labor Party and/or the

Students for a Democratic Society. The meeting convened to

discuss methods of exposing racism and racist practices in

various area college campuses.

Suggested

methods to accomplish these ends which

were discussed at the meeting included (1) supporting strik-

Ing campus workers, (2) exposing racist professors, and (3)

banning books that

advocate the belief that Blacks are

Inferior to Whites.

WE T-I, 3/5/7?

The Progressive Labor Party (PLP), which

was founded in 1965, adopted a constitution

which "resolved to build a revolutionary

movement"

and "build a socialist USA with

all power in the hands

of the working

people."

PLP followed the Chinese communist

line for several years

but became critical

of Chinese leaders for establishing a

dialogue with the U.S. following President

Nixon's visit to China in 1972.

Thereafter,

PLP declared itself to be an independent

Marxist-Leninist' organization aimed at

setting up a dictatorship of the working

class.

According to Milton Rosen, National

chairman, the PLP advocates violent over-

throw.

New York City, has chapters in more than

25 cities in

and undergraduate students.

It was formed in 1972 to work

against the resurgence against racism in higher education

and in society generally.

CAR chapters throughout the country set April 19-22,

1974 as the dates for a major national action/ conference to

combat racism in education, medical care, and medical research.

The main focus of the action was to be a lobbying rally in

Washington, D. C.; however, small, local activities in other

locations around the U. S. were also planned. The following

was a schedule: (1) a march and demonstration of the White

House on Saturday, April 20, (2) workshops at American

University on Sunday, April 21, (3) lobbying in Congress on

Monday, April 22. •

The April 20 demonstration planned opposition to

the recent Committee on Economic Development (CED) report,

which calls for doubling of tuition and reduction of finan-

cial aid by state institutions of higher education, "tracking"

for Black and working class students,

and virtual elimination

of job security through tenure for new faculty. An additional

focus of the CAR action would Involve opposing the recent CED

plans for turning state colleges into primarily centers for

technical and occupational training. Also the demonstration

would oppose continuing government funding of racist research

Aims and Objectives of the CAR

CAR members nationwide are watching closely a case

currently pending before the U. S. Supreme Court. The out-

come of the case will have a profound effect in supporting

or undermining one of CAR's

basic aims: to oppose the reliance

by society on culturally based aptitude and achievement tests

in determining opportunity and reward in American life.

The case involves a lawsuit by a white student

Marco DeFumis, has charged the law school with

crimination" because it denied him admission, but admitted a

number of black and Spanish-speaking students who had lower

scores than his on the Law School Aptitude Test.

CAR has emphasized strongly the fallacy of relying

on such standardized tests as the only or main criterion for

determining. college, graduate school, or law school admission,

- Job opportunities, and so on.

A number of leading

scholars have also questioned

the validity of such tests, pointing out that they are de-

signed by members of the dominant (white culture, and empha-

size a particular class outlook. Therefore, people who come

from that culture, and who have

that class outlook, would

normally make higher scores on them than would people who

come from other cultural and class backgrounds.

Antioch Law School has submitted an "amicus curiae"

(friend of the court) brief on behalf of the Univeristy of

Washington Law School.

A number of other organizations such

as the United Auto Workers and United Mine Workers are also

supporting the school.

The high court, eight of whose nine members are

white, should hand down a decision in the case later this

• term.

CAR also opposes the use of public tax money to

support the promotion of theories of racial, social, or class

inferiority.

Such theories have been cited

in attempts to

justify currently existing social conditions and the unequal

distribution of wealth

among people.

Says: STOP RACT

HARRASSMENT IN

SAN FRANCISCO!

On Wednesday:

150 special San Francisco police, urged on-by Mayor

Alioto (a prime gubarnatorial candidate), began a massive campaign of

street searches and car stoppages of black male suspects in an "attempt"

to apprehend a, "Zebra" (black on white?) killer(s), accused of murdering

13 whites and wounding 7 others. The "Zebra" killings have been used

by the press and the police to create a wave of racist hysteria in the city.

Hundreds of black men fitting the vague description of. the suspect-.

20 - 30 years old, 5'9" - 6: tall- have been repeatedly stopped, some

three or four times, for as long as 30 minutes. This tactic is unprece-

lented in a murder investigation and amounts to nothing more than racist

harrassment of the black population of San Francisco and an attempt to

promote fear and suspicion of blacks by whites.

At a time of serious inflation and economic resession when the

standard of living of all working people, white and non-white, is drastically;

Falling, the U.S, power structure has been using racism as its major tool

¿o divide and conquer working people in this country.

2. Federally funded financial aid for students at all public colleges and universities

adequate to support them in a decent manner, and based on economic need.

3. Federal funds for the hiring of more faculty and staff at all public colleges and

4. Federal funds for both open admissions programs and the supporting educational

facilities required to make them constructive for the students.

5. Recognition of the right of all faculty to job security in the form of tenure after a

reasonable trial period.

6. Expanded affirmative action designed to guarantee the hiring of faculty and staff

and the admission of students from among Black, Latin, Asian, and Native Amer-

icans, and women.

7. Increased federal funding for public school systems of a magnitude sufficient to

reverse the current disastrous downward trend in the quality of public education.

-PETITION ID CONGRESS

The Committee for Economic Develonment (CFD), an influential organiza-

tion that is composed primarily of big-business spokesmen but includes leading

academic figures, has proposed a plan for higher education. This plan, if im-

plemented, will lower the quantity and quality of education available to most

people and further institutionalize racism in our colleges and universities.. In-

deed, sigus of itsimplementatin had alindy amo. gear The CED recommen-

cations and their effects may be summarized as follows.

First, to drastically increase the already prohibitively high tuitions at uni-

versities. Traditional programs of higher education leading to professional ca-

Teers will thus become the exclusive province of the bigher income strata of

society. All universities will become as inaccessible as Harvard, for example,

is today to those from low income backgrounds, who in our society consis. dis-

proportionately of Black, Latin, Asian, and Native Americans.

Second, to institute what the CED calls "new types of curricula" and a "wider

diversity" of institutions supposedly designed to better serve "the nation's varied

manpower requirements." To implement this, state and community colleges will

in essence be converted into vocational training schools. The few opportunities

for the traditional programs of higher education which remain. r' low income

people will effectively be cut off.

All that will remain will be an invidious educa-

sonal systom in which the wealthy äre tracked into thiprofession; and low in-..

come white people as well as Black, Latin, Asian, anc' Native American people

are systematically excluded from professional training. A society in which oppor

tunities are restricted on racial and class lines will thus become even more firm-

ly solidified.

Third, to impose 50% tenure quotas and periodic tenure review on faculty.

This attack on tenure is masqueraded as an attempt to improve educational stand-

ards; it will actually destroy all gains made in faculty working conditions during.

the last twenty years. Job security will arbitrarily be denied to half the member-

ship of the academic professions. This can only have a disastrous effect on

teaching and research programs, and must discriminate against newly hired faculi?

many of whom belong to oppressed groups that have only recently opened a crack

in the barriers to their participation in these professions.

Fourth, the recommendations in the CED report will, if implemented, make

public policy of racist theories like those of CED Research Advisory Board mem-

ber Edward Banfield (The Unheavenly City), Arthur Jensen (Educability and Groun

Differences) and Richard Herrnstein (IQ in the Meritocracy). Their false thescs

that Black and poor white people are genetically or culturally inferior serve to

justify poverty and unequal opportunity on racial and class lines.

Racism

cuttacks, justilled by the recist doctrines cited above,

are throwing white teachers as well as black teachers

out of work al a depression pace.

These are examples of how racisin damages the

economic well-being of all of us. But racism damages

every one of us in still another important way. It disarms

us politically. It divides black and while so that we are

hampered in our fight to win a decent way of life. We

• fight at half strength. And wily? Because the racisi

theorizing we have pointed to and which the govern-

mentsupports, the universities cloak withrespectability,

and the public schools spread far and wide, forces us

to fight among ourselves. Meanwhile, our schools get

worse, our health care deteriorates, and our jobs disap-

pear. These altacks on our well-being, on our economic

and cultural lives, can only be reversed it all of us-

black, white, red, brown, and yellow-are politically

unitud and in trim'for a counter offensive.

These are the reasons why it is crucial for all of us to

fight racism.

COMMITTEE AGAINST RACISM

NH T-1, a source in a position to supply reliable

information,

advised on March 26, 1974, that the committee

was formed to combat the alleged

racism in the genetic and

race series of Professors LAUGHLIN and GINSBURG of the

Anthropology Department faculty. Source advised the group

has been non-violent and has shown no tendency, whatsoever to

•become so.

The group is a small one and does not necessarily

attract any student support outside the Anthropology Depart-

Source advised the group seems to be at the moment,

Indived in local campus issues and the daly external issue

mentioned by the group is their opposition to a Harvard

Professor, name unknown, who also holds genetic and race

theories condemned by the group.

Source could supply no

further information at this time.

On September 24, 1974, NH T-2, who is in a position

to supply information concerning the Committee against Racisn

(CAR) and its membership furnished the following information:

CAR was begun at the University of Connecticut by

a small group of individuals who felt that racism was being

taught on campus by several professors, especially WILLIAM

_LAUGHLIN and ARNOLD GINSBERG of the Anthropology Department.

CAR was formed to combat racist teachings on campus by first

exposing racist professors and then by seeking University

assistance in silencing these individuals by administrative

action, including

termination of contracts if necessary.

Source

stated that it appears that CAR is the only inter-

preter of what is racism and what is not.

...

Source likened CAR to a vigilante group in its

efforts to combat alleged racism by professors involved in

genetic research.

Source advised that during the 1973

school year at the University of Connecticut many professors,

to whom

source referred to as non-critically thinking, joined

CAR because they wanted to be on record as being against

However, this membership soon dwindled after such

individuals as KROCH and PARIS were taking positions of lead-

ership in CAR. Many individuals recognized CAR then as just

a tool of the progressive labar Party and resigned membership.

In the spring of 1974, source advised CAR attempted

to sponsor a faculty resolution

that no racism can be taught

at the University. This resolution was defeated by a faculty

vote.

Source stated that this was the event which caused

CAR to lose all power and influence on the campus.

Source stated that the National Headquarters for

CAR are now either in Detroit at Wayne State or at the

•University of Wisconsin at Madison.

The newsletter "INCAR"

now is printed at one of these two locations. CAR, according

to source, may 'be planning to change its name to International

PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY

CHARACTERIZATION OF SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION•

INTERNAL SECURITY

The Progressive Labor Party (PLP), which was

founded in 1965; adopted a constitution which "resolved to

build a revolutionary movement" and "build a socialist USA

with all power in the hands of the working people."

PLP

followed

. the Chinese communist line for several years but

became critical of

1972. Thereafter, PLD declared itself to be an independent

Marxist-Leninist organization ained at setting up a dictator

ship of the working class. According to Milton Rosen, National

Chairman, the PLP advocates violent overthrow of the Government,

but has set no timetable for its overthrow. The PLP, which

is headquartered in New York City, has chapters in more than

25 cities in the U.S., and has, in the past year, initiated

efforts to make PLP "an international party with

the aim of

rebuilding a new revolutionary communist movement."

In 1972, the PLP organized the Workers Action

Movement (WAil) as a front group in order to build a base

in the trade union movement and to attract workers into PLP.

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY/

WORKER STUDENT ALLIANCE

FORMERLY KNOWN AS STUDENTS FOR A

DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

CHARACTERIZATION OF SUBYERSIVE ORGANIZATION

INTERNAL SECURITY

Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) came into

existence in June; 1962, and for the remainder of that decade

functioned as the leading New Left campus-based student

organization in the U.S.

Irom an initial posture of "partici-

patory democracy," SDS moved toward Marxist-leninist ideological

predomination with debate centering on how best to create a

revolutionary youth novement.

During 196S-1969, internal

factionalism developed within SDS resulting in a split in June;

1969, into three organizations: Weatherman; Worker Student

Alliance (NSA); and Revolutionary Youth Movement (RYM) •

Weatherman and RYll are no longer affiliated with SDS, however,

VSA continues to use the name SDS.

At the 1970 SDS/NSA National Convention, a

confrontation occurred between Progressive Labor Party -(PLP)

(a Harxist-Leninist organization advocating violent overthrow

of the Government) oriented leadership and various caucuses

opposed to PLP domination. The resulting struggle leit the

PLP-oriented leadership in complete control of SDS/WSA,

which was headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

PIP control of SDS/WSA continued until February, 1974,

when the Boston chapter of PLP split from PLP National

Ileadquarters and formed Party for Workers Power i(PWP) (a

"revolutionary communist" organization advocating the violent

overthrow of the government by the workers). SDS/SA is

now fragmented into two

groups, one which supports Ple

policy headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the •

much larger group which supports PLP policy headquartered in

New

York City.

COMMITTEE AGAINST RACISM

NH T-1, a source in a position to supply reliable

information, advised on March 26, 1974, that the committee

was formed to combat the alleged

racism in the genetic and

race series of Professors LAUGHLIN and GINSBURG of the

Anthropology Department faculty. Source advised the group

has been non-violent and has shown no tendency whatsoever to

•become so.. The group is a small one and does not necessarily

attract any student support outside the Anthropology Depart-

ment.

Source advised the group seems to be at the moment,

involved in local campus issues and the only external issue

mentioned by the group is their opposition to a Harvard

Professor, name unknown, who also holds genetic and race

theories condemned, by the group. Source could supply no

further information at this time.

On September 24, 1974, NH T-2, who is in a position

to supply information concerning the Committee against Racism

(CAR) and its membership furnished the following information:

CAR was begun at the University of Connecticut by

a small group of individuals who felt that racism was being

taught on campus by several professors, especially WILLIAM

*LAUGHLIN and ARNOLD GINSBERG of the Anthropology Department.

CAR was formed to combat racist teachings on campus by first

exposing racist professors and then by seeking University

assistance in silencing these individuals by administrative

action, including termination of contracts if necessary.

Source

stated that it appears that CAR is the only inter-

preter of what is racism and what is not.

Source likened CAR to a vigilante group in its

efforts to combat alleged raçism by professors involved in

genetic research.

Source advised that during the 1973

school year at the University of Connecticut many professors,

to whom source referred to as non-critically thinking, joined

CAR because they wanted to be on record as being against

racism.

However, this membership soon dwindled after such

individuals as KROCH and FARIS were taking positions of lead-

ership in CAR. Many individuals recognized CAR then as just

a tool of the progressive labor party and resigned membership

In the spring of 1974, source advised CAR attempted

to sponsor a faculty resolution

that no racism can be taught

at the University. This resolution was defeated by a faculty

vote.

Source stated that this was the event which caused

CAR to lose all power and influence on the campus.

Source stated that the National Headquarters for

CAR

are now either in Detroit at Wayne State or at the

•University of Wisconsin at Madison.

The newsletter "INCAR"

now is printed at one of these two locations." CAR, according

to source, may be planning to change its name to International

Committee

Against Racism because there is at present a

chapter in Toronto, Canada: Source added that the chapter

at Storrs, Connecticut is presently inactive and has a very.

small membership at this time. The group has no real power

on campus at the present time. Source could not supply any

further information concerning the group, but stated the

group is neither extremist oriented, nor violent.

The Progressive Labor Party (PLP), Which was

Chairman, the PLP advocates violent overthrow of the Government,

but has set no timetable for its overthrow. The PIP, which

is headquartered in New York City, has chapters in more than

25 cities in the U.S., and has, in the past year, initiated

efforts to make PLP "an international party with the aim of

rebuilding a new revolutionary communist movement."

In 1972, the PLP organized the Workers Action

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY/

WORKER STUDENT ALLIANCE

FORMERLY KNOWN AS STUDENTS FOR A

DEMIOCRATIC SOCIETY

CHARACTERIZATION OF SUBYERSIVE ORGANIZATION

INTERNAL SECURITY

Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) came into

existence in June; 1962, and for the reminder of that decade

functioned as the leading New Left campus-based student

organization in the U.S. Fron an initial posture of "partici

patory denocracy.," SDS moved toward Marxist-leninist ideological

predomination with debate centering on how best to create a

revolutionary youth movement.

During 1968-1969, internal

factionalism developed within SDS resulting in a split in June,

1969, into three organizations: Weatherman; Worker Student

Alliance (WSA); and Revolutionary Youth Movement (RYN) •

Weatherman and RIll are no longer affiliated with SDS, however,

WSA continues to use the name SDS.

•At the 1970 SDS/VSA National Convention, a

confrontation occurred between Progressive Labor Party-(PLP)

(a Marxist-Leninist organization advocating violent overthrow

of the Government) oriented leadership and various caucuses

opposed to PLP domination. The resulting struggle leit the

PIP-oriented leadership in complete control of SDS/WSA,

Which was headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

reun

PLP control of SDS/WSA continued until february, 1974,

when the Boston chapter of PLP split from PLP National

Headquarters and formed Party for Worlers Power |(PVP) (a

"revolutionary conmunist" organization advocating the violent

overthrow of the government by the workers). SDS/SA is

now fragmented into two groups, one which supports PiP

policy headquartered in Cambridge, Nassachusetts, and the .

much larger group which supports PLP policy headquartered in

New York City.

Dear friend:

Roxbury, Massachusetts 02120

The Carmittee Against Racism (CAR) is organizing Boston Freedom Summer '75,

a counteroffensive against the racist forces in Boston, and we need your help.

CAR is an international, multiracial organization actively fighving racisn in

education and other important areas of life. We believe that racism hurus us

all--black, white, latin; Asian and native American--because it prevents the

unity ve all need to work for social change.

Boston has become the national center of a new wave of racism that is sweeping

the country. If the racist movement in Boston, led by powerful and influential

politicians, gues unchallenged, it can move the entire country in a fascist -

Like direction.

This is why CAr is organizing hundreds of volunteers from all over the country

for a summer of intensive anti-racist activity in Boston. These volunteers

will work with a broad range of local groups, canvass door-to-door in the

city's neighborhoods, distribute leaflets, hold rallies and demonstrations.

The goal is to undermine the political base of the racists and create a vigor-

ous anti-racist, multi-racial movement which will fight for improved education

for all school children.

We in Boston CAR, and the sumer volunteers, need your help NOw. You and/or

your organization can;

--Provide housing for one or more, volunteers from out of town for 211 or

..

Mart of the summer.

-Sponsor an anti-racist volunteer for the surmer by raising $200 or more.

_-Contribute funds for literature, office expenses, mailing costs, etc.

---Invite a speaker from CAR to address your organization, class, and/or

group of friends and neighbors in your home about the Summer Project.

--Participate yourself by helping us organize for the Project, by suggesting

groups we can contact, and by Introducing your friends to CaR.

--Officially endorse the Boston Freedom Summer 175.

Finally, YOU ARE INVITED to the CAR East Coast Organizing Conference for the

Summer Project, in Boston, Saturday aftemoon, April 12, exact time and place

to be announced.

BOSTON 75:

A Call to Action- The International

Committee Ágainst Racism

The Steering Committee of the International

Committee Against Racism (CAR) calls on

students and other interested people to join our

•Freedom Summer Anti-Racist Action Project. Its

purpose is to give a national/international focus

to the anti-racist struggles going on in Boston.

Summer volunteers will work under the leadership

of boston CAR. Together, they will prepare the

way for a strong people's movement which will

unite blacks, whites, and other minorities to fight

for quality, desegregated education and to fight

against the racism being used to wreck the bussing

program. -

This struggle will have a programmatic focus.

Our aim is to select seripusly committed people,

students and others, but especially students, who

will work on. commuter campuses. Student

vólunteers Must register at these schools in order

to be effective. Some people may get jobs. A few

may be assigned to community organizations.

. Other will talk to workers at plant gates and in

union halls. The main focus will be on working

with Boston students, parents, and teachers espec

ially those from ethnic

communities like South

Boston and Roxbury.

A CAR sub-committee (Boston '75) will coor-

dinate all activities. Two one-week

anti-racist

schools will be opened June and July with weekly

workshops to prepare our volunteers for the

correct ways of interacting with the Boston

community. The key strategy is alliances with

existing, rank-and-file forces already mobilized

against racist attacks. The result will be solid,

citywide CAR chapters and other rank-and-file

anti-racist groups, tremendous experiences for our

volunteers, and CAR itself will grow. Only in such

• united, rank-and-file, multiracial, mass

movement can we defeat racism-in Boston and

everywhere.

WHY IS BOSTON FREEDOM

SUMMER '75 SO IMPORTANT!

Because the power structure has kept Boston in

a turmoil. Anti-racist actions, are swept under the

rug, while pro-racist activity resembling fascism, is

given

top billing. Boston

is the

in-

ternational/national expression of racist ideas

published.by.jensen, Herrnstein, and Banfield to

justify the failures of the System. Further Boston

racists are totally organized by political forces

more dangerous than those in the South. The

even the U.S. Supreme Court abet the resistance.

middle-class people from getting a decent school

system to replace a poor one. Racism is keeping

blacks, whites, and other people from fighting

back against unemployment, the cutbacks which

are ruining health, education, and welfare in the

-Boston area. Boston Freedom Summer '75 will

help many white Bostonians especially to begin to

understand that racism hurts them. That without

THE SILENT MAJORITY OF WHITE ANTI-RACIST

turmoil around the 75-76 bussing program, we will

greatly improve our chances of creating an in-

ternational movement against racism.

MOST OF ALL, Boston is the test whether or not

• racist mob-violence, similar to FASCISM, com-

bined with political racism can succeed in

stopping the desegration movemerit. CAR says

with this summer project, "THE RACISTS ARE

GONNA FLUNK THIS TEST!!!!

The Progressive Labor Party (PLP), which

was founded in 1965, adopted a constitution

which "resolved to build a revolutionary

movement" and "build a socialist USA with

all power in the hands of the working

people." PLP followed

the Chinese communist

line for several years but became critical

of Chinese leaders for establishing a

dialogue with the U.S. following President

Nixon's visit to China in 1972.

Thereafter,

PLP declared itself to be an independent

It was formed in 1972 to work

against the resurgence against racism in higher education

and in society generally.

CAR chapters throughout the country set April 19-22,

1974 as the dates for a major national action/conference to

combat racism in education, medical care, and medical research.

The main focus of the action was to be a

lobbying rally in

Washington, D. C.; however, small, local activities in other

locations around the U. S. were also planned. The following

was a schedule: (1) a march and demonstration of the White

House on Saturday, April 20, (2) workshops at American

University on Sunday, April 21, (3) lobbying In Congress on

Monday, April 22.

The April 20 demonstration planned opposition to

the recent Committee on Economic Development (CED) report,

which calls for doubling of tuition and reduction of Iinan

• claraid by state institutions of higher education,

"tracking"

for. Hack and working class studentss and virtual elimination

of job security through tenure for new faculty. An additional

focus of the CAR action would involve opposing the recent CED

plans for turning state colleges into primarily centers for

technical and occupational training.

Also the demonstration

would oppose continuing government funding of racist research

HARRASSMENT IN

SAN FRANCISCO!

On Wednesday: 150 special' San Francisco police, urged on by Mayor

Alioto (a prime gubernatorial candidate), began a massive campaign of

street searches and car stoppages of black male suspects in an "attempt"

to apprehend a "Zebra" (black on white?) killer(s), accused of murdering

13 whites and wounding 7 others. The "Zebra" killings have been used

by the press and the police to create a wave of racist hysteria in the city.

Hundreds of black men fitting the vague description of the suspect--.

20 - 30 years o1d, 5'9" - 6: tall--nave been repeatedly stopped, some

three of four times, for as long as 30 minutes. This tactic is unprece-

dented in a murder investigation and amounts to nothing more than racist

harrassment

the black population of San Francisco and an attempt to

promote fear and suspicion of blacks by whitas.

At a time of serious inflation and economic recession when the

standard of living of all working people, white

and non-white, is drastically

falling, the U.S. power structure has been using racism as its major tool

to divide and conquer working people in this country.

If we are to achieve a better life for all of us, people of all races

1. Free tuition financed by federal funds at all public colleges and universities.

2. Federally funded financial aid for students at all public colleges and universities

adequate to support them'in a decent manner, and based on economic need.

3. Federal funds för the hiring of more faculty and staff at all public colleges and

universities in order to expand educational opportunities.

4. Federal funds for both open admissions programs and the supporting educational

facilities required to make them constructive for the students.

-PETITION TO CONGRESS

The Committee for Economic Develooment (CFD), an influential organiza-

tion that is composed primarily of big-business spokesmen but includes leading

academic figures, has proposed a plan for higher education. This plan, if im-

plemented, will lower the quantity and quality of education available to most

people and further institutionalize racism in our colleges and universities.. In--

deed, signs" of itsimplementatin hard linty Buzged. Te CiD recommen-

dations and their effects may be summarized as follows.

First, to drastically increase the already prohibitively high tuitions at uni-

versities. Traditional programs of higher education leading to professional ca-

reers will thus become the exclusive province of the higher income strata of

society. All universities will become as inaccessible as Harvard, for example,

is today to those from low income backgrounds, who in our society consis. dis-

proportionately of Black, Latin, Asian, and Native Americans.

: Second, to institute what the CED calls "new types of curricula" and a "wider

diversity" of institutions supposedly designed to better serve "the nation's varied

manpower requirements." To implement this, state and community colleges will

in essence be converted into vocational training schools. The few opportunities

for the traditional programs of higher education which remain. I low income

people will effectively be cut off. All that will'femain will be an invidious educa-

unal system in which the wealthy are tracked into the profession., and low in-

come white people as well as Black, Latin, Asian, anç' Native American people

are systematically excluded from professional training. A society in which oppor-

tunities are restricted on racial and class lines will thus become even more firma-

ly solidified.

Third, to impose 50% tenure quotas and periodic tenure review on faculty.

This attack on tenure is masqueraded as an attempt to improve educational stand-

ards; it will actually destroy all gains made in faculty working conditions during

the last twenty years. Job security will arbitrarily be denied to half the member-

ship of the academic professions. This can only have a disastrous effect on

teaching and research programs, and must discriminate against newly hired faculty

many of whom belong to oppressed groups that have only recently opened a crack

in the barriers to their participation in these professions.

Fourth, the recommendations in the CED report will, if implemented, make

public policy of racist theories like those of CED Research Advisory Board mem-

ber Edward Banfield (The Unheavenly City), Arthur Jensen (Educability and Group

Differences) and Richard Herrnstein (IQ in the Meritocracy). Their false theses

that Black and poor white people are genetically or culturally inferior serve to

justify poverty and unequal opportunity on racial and class lines.

cuttacks, justified by the racist doctrines cited above,

are throwing white teachers as well as black teachers

out of work at a depression pace.

These are examples of how racism damages the

economic well-being of all of us. But racism damages

every one of us in still another important way. It disarms

us politically. It divides black and white so that we are

hampered in our fight to win a decent way of life. We

fight at half strength. And why? Because the racist

theorizing we have pointed to and which the govern-

mentsupports, the universities cloak withrespectability,

and the public schools spread far and wide, forces us

to fight among ourselves. Meanwhile, our schools get

,worse, our healm care deteriorates, and our jobs disap-

pear. These altacks on our well-being, on our economic

and'cultural lives, can only be reversed if all of us

blacks, white, red, brown, and yellow-are politically

fight racism.

Ti race are the reasons why it is crucial for all of us to

Jin us in the Spring Action.

theories condemned by the group. Source could supply no

further information at this time.

On September 24, 1974, NH I-2, who is in a position

to supply information concerning the Committee against Racism

(OR) and its membership furnished, the folloying information:

CAR was begun at the University of Connecticut by

a small group of individuals who felt that racism was being

taught on campus by several professors, especially WILLIAM

LAUGHLIN and ARNOLD-GINSBERG of the Anthropology Department.

CAR Was formed to combat racist teachings on campus by first

exposing racist professors and then by seeking University

assistance in silencing these individuals by administrative

action, including termination of contracts if necessary.

Source

stated that it appears that CAR is the only inter-

preter of what is racism and what is not.

Source likened CAR to a vigilante group in its

efforts to combat alleged racism by professors involved in

genetic research.

Source advised that during the 1973

school year at the University of Connecticut many professors,

to whom source referred to as non-critically thinking, joined

CAR because they wanted to be on record as being against

racism.

However, this membership soon dwindled after such

individuals as KROCH and

FARIS were taking positions of lead-

ership in CAR. Many individuals recognized CAR then as just

a tool of the progressive Labor Party and resigned membership.

In the spring of 1974, source advised CAR attempted

PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY

CHARACTERIZATION OF SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION

INTERNAL SECURITY

The Progressive Labor Party (PLP), which was

founded in 1965, adopted a constitution which "resolved to

build a revolutionary movement" and "build a socialist USA

with all power in the hands of the working people."

PLP

followed the Chinese communist line for several years but

became critical of Chinese leaders for establishing a dialogue

with the U.S. following President Nixon's visit to China in

1972.

Thereafter, PLP declared itself to be an independent

Ilarxist-Leninist

organization aimed at setting up a dictator-

ship of the working class. According to Milton Rosen, National

Chairman, the PLP advocates violent overthrow of the Government,

buthas set no timetable for its overthrow., The PIP, which

is headquartered in New York City,

has chapters in more than

25 cities in the U.S., and has, in the past year, initiated •

efforts to make PhP "an international party with the aim of

rebuilding a new revolutionary communist movement."

In 1972, the PLP organized the Workers Action

Ilovement (WAll) as

a front group in order to build a base

in the trade union movement and to attract workers into PLP.

patory denocracy," SDS

moved toward Marxist-leninist ideological

predomination with debate centering on how best to create i

factionalism developed within SDS resulting in a split in oure,

1969, into

Alliance (SA); and Revolutionary Youth Movement (RYM).

Weatherman and RYl are no. longer affiliated with SDS, howevor,

•WSA continues to use the name SDS.,.

At the 1970 SDS/WSA National Convention, a

confrontation occurred between Progressive Labor Party- (PLP)

of the Government) oriented leadership and various caucuses

opposed. to PLP domination.

The resulting struggle leit the

PIp-oriented leadership in complete control of SDS/WSA,

which was headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

PLP control of SDS/WSA continued until February, 1974,

when the Boston chapter of PIP split from PLP National

Headquarters and formed Party for Workers Power I(PVP) (a

"revolutionary communist" organization advocating the violent

overthrow of the government by the workers). SDS/YSA is

now fragmented into two groups, one which supports PYD

policy headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the .

much larger group which supports PLP policy headquartered in

New York City.

push the Jews ahead

should be taken care of.

GALE was not

specific in this regard, but did point out before the end of

his talk that he was not advocating revolution.

Three members of the MCC at Mobile, were interviewed

during late 1972, and described the MCC, Aka

at Mobile, as a church group. They

disclaimed any talk of

convictions, take them to the public square and hang them for

This same source advised that at a meeting of the

"Identity Group" at Mobile, on the night of 12/20/72, MURDOCK

said the only way the world will ever be straight is to

wipe out the Jews and send all

the Negroes back to Africa.

INFORMANT

also advised that at a meeting of the

"Identity Group" in Mobile, on 1/26/73,

DI. MURDOCK said that

Congressman JACK EDWARDS of Nobile, had sold out to the "kikes"

and someone would have to kill him

after the second term (it

is noted that EDWARDS is now in his fifth term as Congressman

and informant feels that the reference to killing of EDWARDS

pertained

to a political killing).

INFormANT also advised that at a

meeting of the"Identity

Mobile, on 2/14/73, MURDOCK said that the "Identity

that several persons attending had ordered water

No precise reason was given why

they would be needed. One member of the group, JESSIE boXTERIFT,

is planning to run for Governor of Alabama, and his political

literature referred to him as the "Hanging candidate for Governor".

Another member, JEFKYCARDEN, is planning to run for Sheriff

of Mobile County, and his political literature refers to him

as

"the hanging sheriff".

INFormaNT also advised that at a meeting of the "Identity

Group" at Mobile, on 2/28/73, Dr. MURDOCK made a statement about

"when we go get that federal Judge", without naming anyone

particular.

A tape was

played of Rev. GALE in which GALE said that

the "Identity Group" has the constitutional right to form a

well regulated militia to take action against elected officials

to do not uphold the constitution.

MURDOCK at this meeting

said the object of the Posse Comitatus is to kill and that if

anyone is not up to it he should drop out now.

Based on the information developed to date by Mobile

and Los Angeles, it is felt that a separate investigation of the

MCC, Aka "Identity Group" should be instituted to develop in

formation concerning the activity on this group on a national

basis, including any plans for the collection of guns and

ammunition or plans to commit any acts of violence or any other

illegal activity..

During these meetings of the MCC at the residence of Dr. MURDOCK,

there was talk about firearms but no informations developed

concerning any supply of guns, or ammunition.

According to this same Mobile source, meetings are

held by the MCC at the residence of Dr. MURDOCK in Mobile, on

Wednesday nights and Sunday mornings.

These meetings are called

church services and include the playing of tapes of a religious

nature prepared by Rev. VILLIAN P. GALE.

According to MO CS 686-E, on 9/14/72, information had

been given that Rev. GALE was to visit Nobile, for meetings with

the "Identity Group" in October, 1972. GALE arrived in Mobile,

on 10/3/72, and at a meeting at the residence of Dr. MURDOCK

the night of 10/5/72, GALE said that people who were trying to

push the Jews ahead should be taken care of.

GALE was not

specific in this regard, but did point out before the end of

his talk that he was not advocating revolution.

Three members of the McC at mobile, were interviewed

during late 1972, and described the MCC, Aka

"Identity Group"

at Mobile, as a church group.

They disclaimed any talk of

violence or the stockpiling of arms and ammunition or of any

type of military drills.

The "Identity" publication oi September, 1972, contains

an article on pages two and three, on the Posse Comitatus.

sets forth that if a local sheriff refuses to perform lawful

duty in the jurisdiction of local citizens, the Posse Comitatus

has the lawful right under natural law to act in the name of the

sheriff to protect local jurisdiction. Arrests may be made

and criminals remanded to the custody of the sheriff for a

trial by citizens jury.

MO 563-E who attends meetings of the "Identity Group"

in Nobile, has advised that at a meeting of the MCC at the

residence of Dr. MURDOCK on the night of 11/15/72, MURDOCK

said the Posse

Comitatus had been formed to force

the sheriff

to enforce the law and arrest judges

or political tools. of

the jews who go against the constitution and on arrest and

convictions, take them to the public square and hang

• them for

treason.

This same source advised that at a meeting of the

"Identity Group" at Mobile, on the night of 12/20/72, MURDOCK

said the only way the world will ever be straight is to

wipe out the Jews and send all the Negroes back to Africa.

MO 563-E also advised that at a meeting of the

"Identity Group" in Mobile, on 1/26/73, Dr. MURDOCK said that

Congressman JACK EDWARDS of Mobile, had sold out to the "kikes"

and someone would have to kill him after the second term (it

is noted that EDYARDS is now in his fifth term as Congressman

and informant feels that the reference to killing of EDWARDS

pertained to a political killing).

MO 563-I also advised that at a meeting of the"Identity

Group"in Mobile, on 2/14/73, MURDOCK said that the "Identity

Group" has posse groups in 40 states. He referred to BILLY GALE

-3-

MO 157-5095

as the head of the Posse Comitatus and as a prophet.

This same

informant reported that at a meeting of the

"Identity Group" at Mobile, the night of 2/21/73, it was reported

that several persons attending had ordered water

purification

tablets through Dr. MURDOCK.

No precise reason was given why

they would be needed. One member of the group, JESSIE LOTHRIFT,

is planning to run for Governor of Alabama, and his political

literature referred to him as the

"Hanging candidate for

Governor".

Another member, JEFRYCARDEN, is planning to run for Sheriff

of Mobile County, and his political literature refers to him

as "the hanging sheriff".

MO 563-E also advised that at a meeting of the "Identity

Group" at Mobile, on 2/28/73, Dr. MURDOCK made a statement

about

"when we go get that Federal Judge", without naming anyone in

particular.

A tape was

played of Rev. GALE in which GALE said that

the "Identity Group" has the constitutional right to form a

well regulated militia to take action against elected officials

to do not uphold the constitution.

said the object of the Posse Comitatus is to kill and that if

anyone is not up to it he should drop out now.

Based on the information developed to date by Mobile

and Los Angeles, it is felt that a separate investigation of

the

MCC, Aka "Identity Group" should be instituted to develop in-

formation concerning the activity on this group on a national

basis, including any plans for the collection of guns and

ammunition or plans to commit any acts of violence or any other

illegal activity.

Memorandum to E. S. Miller

Re: Identity Group

that someone would have to kill Congressman Jack Edwards.

Edwards, from the Mobile area, was advised of this threat

at the time by Inspector David Bowers. Murdock has also

advocated non-payment of Federal taxes.

Carden was one of the original organizers of the

Southerners, a white-hate organization in Mobile. He was

ostracized from that organization becar- : of his

violence-

prone ideas.

He reportedly has a list -I approximately

12 persons who are Jewish whom the group plans to kill in

the Mobile area.

According to Murdock, Carden plans to run

for local Sheriff

and Thrift plans to run for Governor of

Alabama.

They have distributed literature identifying Carden

as the "hanging Sheriff" and identifying Thrift as "the

hanging candidate for Governor."

дук

Thrift was a former leader in the coutherners bui

was also dropped from the Southerners because of his violence-

prone philosophy.

Pertinent information noted above has been disseminated

to interested U. S. Government agencies and local, law enforcement

agencies.

Since the group has held meetings in Mobile as

• recently as February

and March, 1973, Los Angeles and Mobile

should vigorously

pursue investigation concerning captioned

group and conduct investigation to identify individual members

of the group who advocate violence. Both offices being instructed

to insure that all individuals intervieved are specifically

advised ve are not interested in legitimate church activities.

Re: Sheriff's Posse Comitatus (SPC), aka

Citizens' Law Enforcement Research Committee (CLERC)

157-33487

NOTE CONTINUED:

The SEC calls for the establishment of a posse in

each county to assist the only legitimate law enforcement

authority, the county sheriff, in combating the unlawful

acts of otters, particularly those of federal and state

officials.

Members and leadership of the SPC have voiced

hatred for Jews and legroes, advocated the assassination of

Federal law enforcement agents, end lave engaged in acts of

provocation and assault against federal and other law

enforcement officials.

For example, in Sugust, 1974, an

Internal kevenue Service Agent on official business was

held captive by seven members of the SPC in Wisconsin.

The Agent, altiough released unharmed, was pushed and subjected

to questioning by the SFC. As a result of that incident,

SPC member ihomas Stockeimer has been indicced for assaulting

a Federal officer and avaits

trial. both Stockheimer and

other SPC members, in addressing an SPC tax rally hold in

Eureka Springs, Arkansas, in February, 1975, called fox

violence, including tarring end feathering, hanging and

essassinations, against state and lederal law enforcement

officers. Stoccheimer and other SPC members at that rally voiced

hatred for Jews and blacks, and stated that Secretary of State

Henry Kissinger should be assassinated.

IG and SPC are intericlated but separate organizations.

In Menorandum J. G. Deegan to fix. W. R. Wannall dated 3/4/75,

captioned "Identity Group, Also Known As Ministry Of Christ

Church," ve updated IG predication by eliminating SPC. This is

a follow-through of the above, and we are submitting a

separate predication for SFC.
