WEEKLY SUMMARY

Spot checks of residence of subject and

known hangouts of subject when in Tampa, were checked

during December 21-27, 1962 and nothing

unusual noted.

On December 27, 1962, Detective Sergeant

JACK DE LA LLANA, Intelligence

Unit, Tampa PD, advised

that a usually reliable source had advised him that

subject had returned to Mean immediately after

Christmas.

On 12/19/62, LOUIS P. GERACI, Cape Haze,

Florida, a close personal friend of subject, advised

that while he was convalescing from an operation in

a lampa hospital about a month ago, subject visited

him.

According_to GERACI, subject had remarked that

he had been in Brazil for about two or three weeks

investingtmoney in the coffee industry. GERACI

placed this trip to Brazil possibly during the

first three weeks of November, 1962. GERACI did

not know any details concerning the coffee venture

but stated that subject's investment was being made

through "some jew" in Brazil. GERACI stated that he

did not know the area in Brazil where the investment.

has been allegedly made but from his knowledge of

Brazil, he guessed it would be in the San Paulo area

of Brazil.

GERACI stated that subject had no money

invested in Lehigh Acres for if he did, he, GERACI,

would know about it. GERACI also furnished some de-

tails concerning some Cuban persons whom subject

brought to his home in the past.

It would appear that subject's alledged

trip to Brazil above may relate to the disappearance

for subject from Miami during the period 10/19/62

to 11/6/62.

Efforts are being made to gain further

information in this regard.

On 12/21/62, TP 8-C advised he had received

information that in the past several weeks, subject

had been observed in an old model Nash automobile,

faded blue in color, and bearing a Florida license,

registration unknown.
