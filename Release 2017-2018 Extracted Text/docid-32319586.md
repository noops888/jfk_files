HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

- ME. J. T.

Aldhizer

PURPOSE: To record details of the FBI's review of material

furnished by captioned Committee in accordance with

the 10/5/77 Memorandum of Understanding (MU) between the

Department of Justice and the HSCA.

SYNOPSIS: The HSCA material (approximately 4,463 pages) was

received by the FBI on 6/12/79 and reviewed in

accordance with the 10/5/77 MU.

Review by FBI Headquarters

(FBIHQ) Records Management Division (RMD) , Intelligence Divi-

sion (INTD), Criminal Investigative Division (CID), Labora-

tory Division (Lab), Technical Services Division (TSD), and

Legal Counsel Division (LCD) was completed on 6/15/79.

of information to be disclosed which constituted permissible

objections under the MU or factual errors were discussed with

IISCA former Chief Counsel G. Robert Blakey on 6/15/79.

Blakey resolved the matters

raised by accepting certain alter-

native language. Any objections or suggestions rejected by

Blakey did not go to the merit of a permissible objection

under the MU. Details of the matters discussed with Blakey

are set forth. Certain matters were coordinated with the Cen-

tral Intelligence Agency (CIA) as required.

The Department

of Justice

(DOJ) was advised by letter on 6/18/79 that the

FBI review had been completed and that Blakey had resolved

the permissible objections by accepting certain changes. The

FBI review, just concluded, concentrated on information con-

stituting a permissible objection under the MU or a substan-

tive, factual error.

This memorandum should not be construed

as a definitive commentary on the HSCA material... Committee

praise for the 1978 FBI leadership is set forth, as well as

two Committee quotes from Director Webster's testimony

before the HSCA.

RECOMMENDATION: For information.

Memor andum

D. Ryan to Mr. Bailéy

Re:

House Select Committee on Assassinations

RE ASSASSINATION OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.-

SA Aldhizer discussed the following matters with

Mr. Blakey:

Item 1:

On page 156, paragraph 5, the report states,

• . . "the committee was able only to review the files of the.

Royal Canadian Mounted Police

The FBI objected

because this wording implies the HSCA may have obtained RCMP

information from FBI files.

Mr. Blakey agreed to the follow-

ing revised wording:

• . • "the committee was able only to

review

the files of

the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) •

obtained by committee subpoena from local authorities."

Item 2: On page 159, paragraph 6, the report states,

"In a conversation with a female acquaintance later reported

to the FBI, Jerry's response to a general question concerning

his brother's involvement in the assassination was:"

The FBI objected to this passage because it tended

to identify an FBI informant.

Mr. Blakey agreed to the

revised wording of "In a conversation with an acquaintance,

Jerry's

general response to a question concerning

his

brother's involvement in the assassination was:"

Item 3:

On page 195, line 2, it is stated that "One

of the informants was dead and the other, when contacted by

the FBI at the Committee's request, refused an interview,

fearing his life would be endangered if his identity was

revealed.

(26)"

The FBI objected to this passage because it tended

to identify FBI informants.

Mr. Blakey agreed to a substitution of this sen-

tence, which is as follows:

"The informants were either

unavailable or uncooperative. (26)".

Memorandum D. Ryan to Mr. Bailey

Re:

House Select Committee on Assassinations

7: On page 217, small paragraph numbered 4, the

report states,

The committee identified the FBI informant

in SCLC without the assistance of the FBI..

He acknowledged

his former informant status in a committee interview in which

he was also asked about the nature of his relationship with

the Bureau:"

The FBI objected to this wording because it implied

that the HSCA learned of informant's identity through a

review of FBI files.

Mr. Blakey agreed to a revised wording of this sen-

tence, which is as follows:

"The committee learned of the

identity of the FBI's SCLC informant when he acknowledged his

former status in a committee interview.

He was asked about

the nature of his relationship with the Bureau:"

Item 8: On page 240, paragraph 7, the report states

that the FBI's c

conduct was

"morally reprehensible, illegal,

felonious, and unconstitutional."

The FBI objected to this

in discussing the FBI Counterintelligence Program

because the HSCA, in its report, failed to point out suffi-

cient evidence to warrant such language. Mr. Blakey refused

to make any change in this statement.

paragraph l, the report states,

"bashington instructed the faT legal attache in Ottawa to con-

duct a similar review of Canadian passports, with the assis=

tance of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. (127)"

The FBI objected to this statement because it tended

to refer to

the FBI's relationship with a foreign intelligence

service.

Mr. Blakey agreed to revise wording in this para-

graph, which is as follows:

"Washington requested Canadian

authorities to review Canadian passport records. (127)"

Memorandum D. Ryan to MI. Bailey

Re:

House Select Committee on Assassinations

Appendix-Volume XIII - MIK

Item 1: On page 117, last paragraph, the panel

report, in paragraph 32, lists the results of fingerprint

comparisons

on numerous phocographs.

In paragraph 33, the

panel report states that the foca panel. in examining

reports, agreed with earlier findings of the FBI.

parties

these

However,

the report stated that "In addition, the panel determined

that the previously unidentified photograph 1l5, developed

from a. coupon from Eric S. Galt to Modern Photo Bookstore,

bears an impression made by the left thumb of James Earl Ray."

It was pointed out to Mr.. Blakey that this sentence

is misleading and incorrect in view of the fact that the FBI

initially identified photograph 115 as an impression of Ray's

left thumb, and therefore the ISCA only confirmed this finding.

Mr. Blakey agreed to make the following changes in

the report:

(1) On page 116, under photograph 115, the l

number of 326 was added in parentheses following the word

"Store"; (2) on page 117, information concerning the identifi-

cation of photograph 115

would be listed in the correct chrono-

logical order under paragraph 32; (3) the sentence in the last

paragraph

on page 117, in paragraph 33, beginning with "In

addition," would therefore be deleted.,

Item 2: On page 127, bottom of the page, under item (e),

there appears the sentence "The FBI received this

specimen

from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on June 4, 1968."

The FBI objected to inclusion of this information

because it disclosed

the FBI's relationshipp with a foreign

intelligence service.

Mr. Blakey agreed to delete this

sentence.
