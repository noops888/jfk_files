1. POTENTIAL COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

ACTION

AD HOC OPERATION (5)

It has been decided that the Ad Hoc Operation will

be expanded from 1ts Chicago base to include chapters In New

York as well as Seattle and San Francisco. New York originally

recommended NY 1991-S as the informant who would organize the

Ad Hoc Committeesin New York.

The Bureau did not think this

Informant was sultable for this operation. The No is attempting

to find another informant to be used in the Ad Hoc Operation

WILLIAM ALBERTSON

It was recently learned that GUS HALL thinks

ALBERISON wrote the document which resulted in his expulsion.

HALL felt no other conclusion could be reached because of

the opinion of the various handwriting experts who examined

the document.

HALI now considers the ALBERTSON case closed.

The NYO has proposed certain follow-up action

which could be initiated in the ALBERTSON case.

CP of ITALY

The Bureau had planned to send a letter ostensibly

from the CP of Italy to the CPUSA designed to cause confusion

and dissension over the question of the sino-soviet silt and

the conference of CP leaders scheduled to be held in Moscow

on 12/15/64.

The Bureau is holding this plan in abeyance

because of the

517 P. Sancelation of this conference and the uncertainl

or furnishing misleaging information to Czechoslovaki

Intelligence Servicel through NY 203455.

This information

would be about the us space program,

and 1t was expected

the czechs would pass the information on to the soviets.

The Bureau

advised the matter would be discussed with

officers of appropriate agencies at the Seat of

Government.

PUBLISHING OF POLISH INTELLIGENCE

AGENT'S PURCHASES IN US (

By letter dated 10/1/64, the NYO outlined &

plan for reducing

the amount of money available to

Polish intelligence personnel in the hopes it would

Increase our chances of bringing about a defection.

It has been their practice to buy a great many items

which they take back to Poland and sell at a big

Arrangements could be

made to publish examples of this sort of thing in the

emigre press.

This would no doubt come to the attention

of Polish officials who could be expected to put a stop

to trading of this sort.

This would eliminate what has

been an important source of funds for Polish intelligence

personnel at a time when their salarles have been reduced. (M(4)

2. PENDING COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

ACTION

BRONX CP ORGANIZATION

The CP organization in the Bronx has grown

increasingly stagnent through a combination of various

circumstances.

A study is being made of the factors

that brought on this stagnation with the thought

that we may be able to devigo a

• letter or a series

of letters to the individual CP leaders in the Bronx

pointing out various mistakes of the leadership. The

letters would contain legitimate criticism and some

worthwhile suggestions,

but would be designed to

cause friction and factionalism.

FORMATION OF FICTITIOUS COMMUNIST ORGANIZATIONS

Consideration was being given to the formation of

of a fictitious chapter of the W.E.B. Du Bois Clubs of America

in an area where there Is now little or no CP activity of

Consideration was also being given to the formation%of

Club, in Memphis or Oklahoma City.

AMERICAN COMMITTEE FOR A TRUE

MARXIST - LENINIST COMMUNIST PARTY (ACTMLOP)

NYO has paid the rent thru March, 1965 on

PO. Box Er6ges Grand Central Station which is held in the

name of the ACTMLCP.

The NYO has not recommended any

additional use of this fictitious organization because it

tends to parallel the Ad Hoc Operation in some respects.

The ACTMLEP was set up to alert people who might not otherwise

know) as to the Communist nature of the W.E.B. Du Bois Clubs.

It is belleved that when the ACTMICP 1s used again, it could

be for this same general purpose.

The NYO will remain alert

to the possibility of exposing other Communist controlled

organizations, which wishes to conceal their Communist control,

by asking the people they are trying to influence to resist

the "Revisionist" line of the Communist controlled organization.

MAY DAY RALLY, 1965

The NYO sent a number of post cards to security

Index subjects at their place of employment advising them of

a NCASF rally held on 11/12/64. The tangible results of

this operation ane set out below.

The NYo intends to

secure Bureau authority Formaking similar mailings in connection

with the next May Day celebration.
