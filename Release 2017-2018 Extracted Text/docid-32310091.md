I said fine and everything was lovely until they got ...

money so these guys didn't want to pay until 90 days after they

collect their money.

Inaudible

So I think they're in trouble too

what they're doing is taking the dough outta there and

stickin' it in their pocket

They don't have that kind of money which is

Inaudible conversation

(V) No, as a director you're liable for everything . .

putting them on notice.

We're putting them on notice.

Detroit with a lot of people I know and I had to collect the

money from them . . $100,000 I got

I had to go over there

and tell them that

(V)

Sully Sherone our attorney, he told me that he

had

seen Jimmy, of course they were on this negotiation and

he was the one

who told me about . .

• this was actually

before it was in the paper that they're moving down to

Chattanooga and that

•• • tough one . . . I know from the

work we've done in that

state and knowing that state, they

don't like outsiders.

I don't see how he's gonna come out unless

they get a fix in there. I just don't know how. This is

the toughest one he's ever had.

Inaudible

(V)

... . Jimmy's head attorney

(M) Whose, Jimmy's head attorney? Which one is that?

(V) That's the fellow from

town here.

(M) Oh, he's from Detroit .

Inaudible

..

(V)

• . . I happened to walk in his office

•• . and he had

just come back... this was before they got the move

and he says you know this thing happened . . . there isn't

an attorney who can tackle this.

They're all

scared

to

death and this guy's staying down in Washington.

(M) Well, I'm not so sure that that isn't actually gonna be the

route, that, they can get some help down there cause . ..

working as we did

.., that's a practical state

•.. and on

the other hand I've never seen, you know you talk about

clannishness up in New Hampshire or the clannishness out on

the North Shore in Chicago.

Those people are all related to

each other and unless you're in, you're out and they don't

like anybody from the outside.

Now that would be true.

they wouldn't like Jimmy but on the other hand, they're not

gonna like Bobby either . . .

(M) One thing that concerns me though is when we talked' in Washington

and talked

about the possibility of Chicago and so on...

(M)

I can't see how it's gonna do one darn bit of good to have the

fix in Chicago.

If he gets convicted in Tennessee, because

if he's convicted in Tennessee and comes to Chicago with a

recent felon, he's had it.

No matter how much your Judge might

help . . . because under those circumstances

(V)

... it's-just too soon . . .

Inaudible

(M)

•'• At least we can keep track of it in Chicago because

we'll be in a position to help ..

apparently they're just

gonna make sure that the one down South is

→..

I don't know why .

Inaudible

(V) I don't think it's helped him a lot to get it moved.

(M)

Well, I think as a matter of fact, it's probably hurt because

this is a little town . ..

(M)

Sort of a home town type thing where everybody knows everybody

and

there is certainly no industry there compared tọ Nashville.

•' in an industrial community . . : why he might just on the

law of averages get friendlier.

(M)

... . that bothers me because you surely think that

(V) He's the fellow I met before

..

(M) They have, they have . . .

(M)

• • • • and

we've worked

with Clements and we've

worked with

• and these are practical

guys

(V) Well, Clements is . . . I understand a practical

(M)

.. and anybody that's on the bench down there is gonna

listen

..

• which is from that point of view a practical thing

but it bothers me cause he's gotta come out of Tennessee I

think without a conviction otherwise when he comes to Chicago

I think that it could be done, I really do

ah

and it

can be done fast but . . ah

if they're gonna move, they're

gonna have to move and move fast.

(V) . ... true ...

(V) It can't be done by Jimmy, it's got. to be done by somebody

else .

(M)

I agree absolutely, it's gotta be somebody in an entirely different

industry, you as a

banker or somebody like myself 'as an engineer

..

that can, that has other business down there, other reasón

to be talking

the situation down in Chattanooga at

all bút.. ah . . I think

it can be done but it costs money.

(V) Like, any idea?

(M) Well, I would just guess, I would think that . . ah . . to

delude the top guy is gonna cost a quarter of a million bucks.

Maybe even half a million.

Campaign contributions I don't

think they're interested in. I think they'd be interested in

real money.

Maybe

•• • deposited out of the United States on

a COD basis, that way you know somebody doesn't get paid before

they get through.. ah. cause they work on the honor

they always have. but that the

that even though we have this

bankruptcy in.. all kinds of interstate highway stuff and

Yu are on the out a it i to the ring are sato

that's it. No hitches, no problems.

The tape recorder was concealed

by Special Agent William F. Hood prior to

flying to

and was removed immediately upon his return to O'Hare

International Airport where he was met by Special Agents William

F. Hood

and Gale T. Johnson at approximately 2:40 P.M., CST,

January 10, 1964.

Upon removal of the recorder, it was noted

that the supply reel of the recorder had been completely emptied.
