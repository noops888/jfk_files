It is from this hase of operations that.

it appears, Mitch Werßell has been med.

dline again. this time in the affairs of the

about lo-become suvereign rente uf the

Bahamas.

His activities - althogh no one is

completely sure just what they entail -

have prompted Bahamas Prime Minister

Lynden Pindling to denounce WerBell

and attorney Edwin Marger, an associate,

on the floor of the

Bahamian

Parlia-

ment. Pindling called them internation-

al fortune hunters"

with "designs on the

territorial sovereignty of the Bahamas."

Werbell's irvolvement in the Bahamas

-as an advisor to a faction that wants

the island of Abaco either to remain a

Crown Colony or to become a separate

nation when the rest of the Bahamas be-

cornes fully independent on July

has also prompted some concern by the

Affairs Desk.

It is not a completely unfamiliar expr-

rience to Merkell to have elements of the

United States government at least con-

cerried

afraid I approached it in this connection

and I continuer in do so. I felt that this

was a very amateurish attempt at some-

thing which I didn' know really what

was going on, and it was an interlude of

entertainment as far as I'm concerned."

The role

he played is also

unclear.

Emm the point that CBs entered the sit-

at various times to be a network consul-

vasion altempt and that he "did nothing

" In 1970, however. WerBell told

an Aliants magazine writer, "When you

work for the company, they take care of

you."

"The company" is generally used as a

euphemism

for

the Central

Intelligence

Agency - an arm of government WerBell

says now he has never had ansthing to do

with, except to sell it some guns.

The

company he was talking about, he says,

was CBS. Over the years, however, Wer-

Bell has spoken often. of his association

with the Company. Producer McMullen

quoted WerBell to the congressmen as say.

ung he had "previous experience" with "the

company:"

"And when I asked him what

company he meant, he said the CLA," Mc-

Mullen said.

"Everybody always pets that impression

about any goddam thing we do.

by the U.S. Air Force as he demonstrated

his firm's revolutionary silenced sub

machine gun to a South Vietnamese gener-

al?

To questions such as these, WerBell's

standard reply is. "I guess I'm just lucky."

More than just luck, however, WerBell's

propensity for being in the crucial place

at the crucial time seems to stem from a

combination of machismo, the profit mo-

sive, a knack for developing sume atly rad.

ical weaponry and a plug-in to the Oid Boy

Network.

The Old Boy Network - "And don't you

ever kid yourself that there isn't such a

thing," says WerBell — is the cloak-and-

dagger types answer to the union hiring

hal!. It is a lonsely structured help want-

ed-situation wanted grapevine. "I became

friends with a bunch of guys who are now

four- and five-star generals." recalls Wer-

Bell of his days as an OSS captain behind

Japanese lines in World War I.

Memorabilia of the OSS days and sub

sequent

adventures hang in

WerBell's

home and in his psyche. The walls of buth

his

upstairs den and downstairs

"war

roum"

are decorated with dozens of hunt-

ing (upstairs) and military (downstairs)

weapons. Six unsheathed

swords

are

mounted on the door of the liquor cabinet.

Two plase display cases in the den, each

locked,

contain handguns ranging. from

standard

assassination pistols.

Daggers,

bayonets

and throwing knives fill the in-between

spares

as bric-a-brac.

Photographs

of

short,

slant-eyed generals hang on walls

and stand on tables. Between two wild boar

heads above the den entrance is a framed

certificate fmm the Vietnamese Airborne.

The bigrest war souvenir, though, isn't

on WerBell's wall. It is in his head - the

way a man of 55 acts after more than 20

jears of being in and on the fringes of vio.

lent conflicts.

known in a reporter for the London Daily

Mirror (circulation five

million) tha: he

was: 1) four-square for the cause of the

Council for a Free Abaco, and 2) récruiting

British mercenaries "for a project l have in

mind."

Abaco? "Who said it was Abaco?"

said WerBell. The fruit of the interview

was a front-page story headlined: "Mutiny

in Paradise.

The Island That Wants to

Stay British ... A Call Goes Out fur Mer.

• Such were the initial tactica in the Bar-

tle of Abaco, a cause that, for awhile in the

British press, seemed second in anticipated

fercity only to the Catholicg.rg.-Proteg-

tants strife in Northern Ireland. Joining

W'erBell as a comrade-in-press release was

La.-Col. Colin (Mad Mitch) Mitchell, a

right-wing House of Commons member

Highlanders. Mitchell, who was muttering

Bell in Powder Springs, WerBell said

While there are some people who admire

flamboyance such as WerBell's, there are

WerBell's former business associates, a

WerBell and his associates in Powder

Springs have now reincorporated under the

name of Defense Systemg International

aside, however. there remain the questiona

of how WerBell got involved with the Free

Abaco faction, what he is doing for it and

how he is getting paid.

The leadership of the Council for a Free

Abaco appears to be composed of two mea,

Ma:kins and Charles (Ci:uch) Hall. Wat-

kins, the chairman, is a retired Bahamas

policeman and former Nassau resident. He

was elected to the House of Ascembly from

Abaco on the Free National Morement

ticket last

September.

With a budget that they will desenbe no

more specifically than to say it is less than

So far. there has been

And about a referendum

on

Anaco July S - the day before Bahamian

says Wer-

Bell.

The accuracy. of that assessment of feel.

ing on Abaco can he questioned. Many of

the Abaconians who originally opposed

separation from the Crown abandoned the

movement as fruitless in December, when

the British government decreed that the

Baharas - all of the Bahamas - gould

become independent. Nor was there ever

complete opposition throughout Abaco to

dence: of the two Farliament members

elected by the isiand's 6.500 residente, the

one other than Watkins is a Pindling sup

porter and a backer of independence. The

impetus. for the Free Abaco movement,

both Pindling and Minister of Extenial

Affairs Faul Adderly have charged, comes

from outside the Bahamas. "I still think

that what they are basically involved in is

the „sisaling of land,"

Adderly said in a

recent interview. And indeed, the majority

• the people on Abaco kons very little of

WerBell and Marger outside of what they

"Every goddam single symptem that

was present in Cuba exists in the Bahamas

today,

" he says.

Wer Bell's opinion of the Pindling gov-

ernment and of the Bahamas' politivai cli-

mate is one which meny observers of the

Bahainas do not share. Although the over-

whelming majority of the

islanders are

black and have become very assertive con- U

cerning racial equality during the past de-

cade or so, the Banamas have teen deeply

There are no Headquarter's traces on Dr. George A. Winkler,

but there are traces on the Military Armament Corporation

Board Chairman, Sir. Mitchell Livingston HerBell III (201-259910).

In 1967 WerBell organized a fira called SIONICS, Incorporated

(Studies in Operational Negation of Insugency and Counter Subversion),

•specializing in producing silencers.

Armanent Corporation with kerbell as Chairman of the Board.

Mitchell Livingston Werbell, III

1. 00. 9 Mar 71 we received a long disturce call, presumably fren Powder

Springs, Georgia, from subject, who is an old and unsavory contact of this

office dating from 1959.

Herbell has been involved in a variety of scrapes,

the latest of which concerned an abortive invasion of Haitt which Joha Gready

was very such concerned about a jear or so ago.

Herbell stated that the Departent of Defense had just revoked his

security cleararce on grounds of herbell'a "frivolous behavior" in the laitian

cerning developoents in the laition natter.

3. Herbell assed if there was anything that we could do for his in the

way of interceding for hin with the DOD, and we inforned his bluatly and in

no uncertain terus that he was strictly on his own, and he could do nothing

He then asked if it would be worthwhile to subpoena Bart Gonzales.

He inforacd hin that it was up to hie attorney to make such recomendations.

4..

herbell seemed to get the message, and then offered to keep us advised

regarding an alleged forthcosing attempt on liaiti which is being sponsored by

Rolando Kasferrer, even though Yasferrer is currently incarcerated in a federal

prison. He told werbell that if he wished to pass any inforcation along le

would accept it hut under no circuntances should he atte-pt to elfcit.any

information on our behalf. He agreed that he would operate on this basis and

said he sight be in touch with us again.

5. In view of Werbell's record we felt that this latest contact should

be a matter of record and that OGC should be inforsed of developmente.

H. Systematte Introduction of Military Judgement

Ly definition the neusralization or defeat of

Communist terrorism consists of the speciulized application

of inunter-insurgency aporations by tie enployment of intelli-

gence: aspcinlogical operations; hunter-killer operations to

include jungle, nountain, sir, riverine, lioriler, and village

scurity operations: communications: logistics; specialized

training ansi equiprent, and other techniques. SIONICS, Inc.

considers that the technigues designed by our Corporation to

neutralize coumunist terrorism in the border areas of Thalland

is based on sound past experience in this field and would lead

to the development of a wide-spread organization and system

within the royal flai Armed Forces (25A7), the Border Patrol

FOLiCe (UPP), and the Thai National Police (INP) to counteract

this tireot

roughout the country.

establishmentiose system and organication to neutrals

the Communist threat cannot be accomplished without reliance

on sound and informed military judgement based on proven

techniques. SIONICS, Inc. has pioneeres in the development

of these technigues which permit the systematic development and

usi in analysis and exccution of

§ military and technical judge-

rment

Tre techniques and equipren: developed for this purpose

are resigned and operate for the "usual of normal" case in which

they will.becusedsunder combat conditions. The capability that.

accrues from the employment of these techniques and equipment in

The purpose of thir program will be to strike

the coimurist insurgents where they are rost vulnerable and to

mush the operations of selected Special Operations Hunter/Killer

Teams into present royal Thai Government ongoing Counterinsurgency

Programs based or the proven and historic causes of victory over.

the Corrunists:

Aggressive anti-guerrilla tactics.

Removal of sections of the population thus

depriving insurgents of contact with the people.

Removal of the support of the population.

In attacking Communist terrorist vulnerability

wma.620-210021-8

the Special gperations Hunter/Killer program will be designed

to operate against the enemy and concentrate on the following

cateyories of insurgent vulnerability:

1. Insurgent base area system which, although.

fragmented, is a coherent complex of combat, combat support, and

combat

service support facilities and activities which erbrace...

populated as well as remote areas. In this, Special Operations

unter/killer Teams will, in the final, phases of the operation,

be durected to attäck or operate on the perimeters of insurgent

base area systems.

roostrishu 2:-Insurgent corbat units in avoiding prolonged

combat may use escape routes that will subject them ideally to

ambush by Hunter/Killer Teams. In this, the classic principals

of "the hanner and anvil operation" will be employed. Helicopter

as appropriate: e.g., the evaluation should be an elaboration

of corsion sense and convenient ordering of evaluation matters

6. l'uture Operations

ne the end of phase v the icint should have proved

itsulf as one of the rost effective counter-insurgency programs

available to the RTG. Ni an example, in & months operations

the 72 snipers

of the U.S: 9th Division attained over 600

confirmed kills, the majority of which weis made at night with

the M-18 rifle/Starlight Scope/SIONICS-ilA: A2 suppressor combin-

ation:

In effecting this admirable record, 1.37 cartridges

were expended per kill.

"Ati the current cost of 286 for. one

rational watch cartridge, this averages to 384 per kill. This

is obviously an oversimplification, but it highlights an extremely

successful and economical rethod of countering connunist terrorism

along the borders of thailand.

is a final note, this type of operation is as yet

in its nascent stages:

Complete operational techniques that will

result from execution of the 12 month NCTTT will undoubtedly

disclose

additional and more effective techniques of killing or

neutralizing communist terrorists in Thailand and will contrikute

inneasurably to bringing stability and RTG fontrol into its

border areas.
