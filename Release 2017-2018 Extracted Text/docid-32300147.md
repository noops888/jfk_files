It should be pointed out to the Criminal Division

of the Department that the information being furnished was

obtained from a sensitive source on'a strictly confidentia.

basis,

but no restriction to dissemination to the Department

is intended.

A check of public source references and efforts

by MEX-225 and MEX-170 have failed to reveal the operation

of the Intercontinental Insurance and Security Co. in Mexico

City, although as noted in the letterhead memorandum, this

firm had several joint accounts at the Banco del Pais, S.A.

It should be carefully noted that all information

attributed to the three confidential sources is of a

confidential nature and that these sources are not available

to testify or to furnish depositions concerning same.

ALFONSO FRIAS, Assistant Chief, Special Investigations

Department of the Bank of Mexico, who arranged for a

special review of Banco del Pals,

S.A. records, advised

a Bureau police liaison Agent that all information furnished

at this time and additional information being obtained

should be regarded as strictly confidential.

A second confidential

source abroad, who 1s unavailable

to testify or furnish a deposition and who has furnished reliable

information in the past, advised on August 12, 1963, as follows:

The records of the Mexican Immigration Service reflect

that shortly after the incorporation of the Cia. Azteca de

Administracion, S.A., on April 20, 1960, a series of letters

was directed to the Mexican Immigration Service by this company

in an effort to obtain authorization for STEWART B. HOPPS to

assume charge of the company.

After several refusals, said

authorization was finally granted on June 13, 1961, but

apparently HOPPS did not enter Mexico as the Mexican Government

files fail to reflect any further

action in this connection.

These same Mexican Government files reflect that JOHN

M. KEARNEY (CLEARY) was born March 20, 1895, at La Plata,

Maryland, and entered Mexico at Nuevo

Laredo on October 20,

1920, and was engaged for many years at Veracruz and vicinity

1o 2-

as an employee of oil companies (not specified).

He is married

to MARIA TERESA NOLAN and he became a Mexican citizen on

April 20, 1945.

The records of the Visa Section of the American

Embassy reflect that JOHN KEARNEY (CLEARY), Mexican citizen,

born March 20, 1895, at La Plata, Maryland, with residence

at R1o Tamesis #3, Mexico City, was issued visas on January 3,

1961, and December 26, 1962. He has an unlimited visa to

travel to the United States until December 26, 1963. Efforts
