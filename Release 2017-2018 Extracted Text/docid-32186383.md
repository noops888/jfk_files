something Constructive. This Gill recently, a few years

or less ago Made a trip to the Soviet Union

etc on the

Youth Conference know as the 'World Youth Conference.'

He will probably emerge from the New York thing as a

11 time orgenter in sous spectal field auch as youth. (SU)

At the start of the Meeting Genne brought out

her brief case full of clippings. (Newspaper) ete

she

also had a lot of penciled notes which she was

undoubtedly going to use to show what she was doing

and to give others hell for not co-operating with her. (g)U)

But the first discussion by A. Johnson centered around

the late Pres. Kennedy. (4)(U)

Arnold explained that since Oswald was Considered a

Communist then a wave of hysteria was about to explode

against the C. party of America but by the time the

reactionaries were getting started it was announced

that it had been disclosed that it seemed like the

extreme

right had been active. This was bore out

by the declaration of Russia that It was not the

C. party that had done it because Kennedy was a

friend of the working class but the work of the extreme

right or almost a fascist act. This seemed to sober

the masses that it was the same caliber of people who

had insulted Stevenson only weeks before in Dalbas,

Texas.

+)U)

Arnold

stated he was asked by C.B.S. News about this

Oswald as to a letter he had written

to the party, he

told them he gets lots of letters of

enquiry about the

C. party and he probably answered it as he does hundreds

of others and even sent him literature if he requested

It. They (C.B.S.) wanted him to go on the air with a

statement but he

stated to them he would have to dig the

letter out and be

sure before he Made any statement.

Randal Gorby asked Arnold Johnson it when he got back to

New York to l00k in the files it

he had a letter fron

Wn Pokas, formerly from Bellaire, Ohio, and also an

inmate of Cambridge Asylum for a period of time, Gorby

asked Johnson to compare the

letter of Pokey's with

Oswald's to see if they didn't have a lot in Common.

Palmer stated that

he thought the statement by the

Methodist Minister Covered the situation very good

when he stated that the fact that the Murder of Bill

Moore, M Edgar Evers and others in the south going

by without punishment had set the stage for the

Assassination of Pres. Kennedy. Everyone readily

agreed. (g)(U)

Arnold Johnson further stated that no real Marxist

Could do such a thing. There is not Much doubt that

since the soviet Union had expelled him by not

giving him a Citizenship in the Soviet Union because

they thought him to be an Agent of Fascisi. Genne

Meanwhile was Chomping at the bit trying to get her

story told about the N.A.A.C.P. and CORE. @)(U)

she finally got her chance to unload (k)U)

stated that about the time of the Civil Rights

March on Washington a

few days before she had been

working with CORE and NAACP the reporter from the

Wheeling paper Intelligencer had Called and wanted

to talk about her. She gave

him answets on the

phone and finally hung up on him.

from the time

this phone conversation was completed she had been

quoted in the newspaper and exposed as a Communist

party Member,

which brought about her expolsion fron

the N.A.A.C.P., but since has been restored to

Membership.

Then lately a Man: (Negro) by name of Johnson

head of

the local cort group was indicted for robbing a

bus driver in Steubenville,

Ohio. Genne had got in

touch with R. Gorby as she thought Johnson was being

franed. Gorby found out and told her at this Meeting

that he had did the robbing and was Not being framed.

The best thing to do stated Gorby was to give him

help but do not put CORE and the NAACP out on a 1imb

by doing it.

"Palmer stated that it was News to him as the only thing

he. Knew about it was the articles In the paper and the

first one looked as if Genne had stayed on the phone

too long should have hung up quick.

He also stated that

In 1948 when he had this trouble everyone Knew about

it and then he got more help and was successful in

defeating

the reactionaries.

You have to always work

together on these Matters If you will be successful.

The hour was drawing Near ten o'clock P.M, and the

Stauber 111a delegation had to work that kita. (4)(V)

Lunch was furnished by each and everyone with the

exception of A Johneon and he put away plenty. (AU)

Johnson stated that he had been down this way about one

week ago and had Contacted some of his old friends by

phone,

one in particular was Adolph Pacifico he

wanted to talk to

him on a so called Applachian Coal project

During the time Genne Kuhn was belly

aching about not

getting help from the Valley group it was pointed out

by A Johnson that some years back when the wheeling group

was a part of w. Virginia group that difficulties existed

and now with the wheeling group in with ohio valley the

trouble still exists. He also pointed out that distance

has a lot to do with it too. Genne stated that Fred

Walehli was supposed to show up with the Beer. She

was urged to call him against her wishes but she got

no answer on the phone"
