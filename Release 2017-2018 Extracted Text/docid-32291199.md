CONFIPENTIAL

MM 97-327

in the November 14, 1965 attack,

the Bureau desired to

be expeditiously advised whether the facts concerning

this attack constitute a violation of neutrality statutes

and if so, whether prosecution is contemplated.

The

Department was advised that the Bureau was holding further

investigation of this matter in abeyance pending their

reply.

In view of the information furnished by Dr.

SANTIAGO ALVAREZ that he had initially participated in

discussions with MIGUEL IZA and HERMINIO DIAZ concerning

a possible operation against Cuba but later withdrew from

these plans, as well as the information that is son,

SANTIAGO ALVAREZ, JR., was not involved, it is not believed

that additional investigation of this matter as related to

the MRR, 1s warranted.

• ч.

MA T-1 18 MM. 974-56 S/M)

In connection with future investigative efforts

-of the MRR by the Miami Office,

it is noted that this

organization has been of operational interest to CIA for

a considerable period of time.

Although the MRR has with-

drawn its elements from Central America, the organization

in Miami is obviously continuing to receive financial

support from CIA Accordingly, Miami plans to canvassu

logical informants for any pertinent information concern

ing current or projected MRR activities and in the absence

of any information which would dictate to

the contrary,

will consider submitting a closing report
