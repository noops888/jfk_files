results were not available at the time of the dictation of

on December 29, 1958. Toll calls placed from GLendale 4-0532

but no toll calls could be located which appeared significant

to this investigation.

On December 5, 1958, GUERRIERI advised he is certain

that MAINER was in Canton, Ohio, at the time of instant theft

and he approached him for some of the guns and from his

behavior, he is certain that he had a part in the theft.

New York airtel to the Bureau, November 10, 1958,

advised that LOUIS MARTINEZ had made a telephone call from

the

Manhattan Hotel, New York, on September 19, 1958, to

Canton, Ohio, GLendale 4-0532, which is listed to the varsity

Restaurant,

a hangout for GEORGE MIKE FLOREA,a local hoodlum.

PCI JOHN APOSTOLOS advised SA JAMES E. GILLEY On

November 17, 1958, that he had seen GEORGE FLOREA and LOUIS

MARTINEZ together several times in Canton during the past few

months although he could not recall the exact dates. - Be

never heard either of them discuss the theft of weapons at the

Ohio National Guard Amory in Canton. PCI could not recall

1958, from New York, however, a couple of days before MARTINEZ,

the bartender, who takes messages for FLOREA and SAM MESSARIS

when they are not there.

According to PCI, KARRAS 1s a loyal

member of the gang and

cannot be trusted.

KARRAS later mentioned

tnat MARTINEZ wanted money when he called and it was PCI's

opinion that the money was requested of FLOREA.

PCI stated that FLOREA had not been around for several

weeks and was working with PHIL MAINER at Calumet City, Illinois.

FLOREA gave a telephone number of TO 2-9628 where he could be

reached, which is probably the "Rip Tide Bar" in that city.
