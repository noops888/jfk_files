things that may have fallen between the desk, because maybe it

wasn't clear who was going to write the memorandum. It could

Had you

"been belated before the meeting about

what Lansdale was Involved in, or was that general knowledge in

the Bureau to people in this area?.

Mr. Cotter, Well, as I say, to the beat of my recollection

I cannot apecifically recall words, but I'm sure Donahoe probably

told Nasca and I that he vanted us to accompany him to Belmont's,

office, that thia General Lansdale was going to be there, that ho

had been appointed, I believe, by the whito llouse to head up a

special projects type thing with rogard to Cuba, but that was 1:1

It would have bean vary general, and that we ware going alony

just in case Belmont needed some information about what the

Bureau was doing.

MI. Wallach. All Ilght.

One of the points you said Lansdale wanted to find out was

what the Bureau was doing vie-a-vis Cuba.

What wag the Bureau doing vig-a-via Cuba at that time?

MI. Cotter. Well, we were investigating very strenuously

with regard to any allegations of individuals or groups who wer:

¡or alleged to be engaged in pro-Castro activities. The emura::

was always on trying to find Cuban intelliyence agents operdia::

! in the United States, and there were several cases where we

either iduntified agents or people were vory highly suspecsod

of such.

Burcau got a lot of information from over a long period of time.

As i recall, there were one

most of which was very flaky and at least in my opinion was u!

were reporting to the Bureau kept portraying the hardships tha:

were going on in Cuba, and they painted a picture in general in f

turned up today at a reception at the Brazilian Embassy in

interview at that time was somewhat unusual.
