pretty. confusing but Luis rade it clear that there was

something very important, that It Involved Rolando dUsaLAS

that Rolando wanted me to go to Paris on an urgent matter,

and that another friend, Luis Irasencos, knew something

about 1t.

The letter said that the CIA

and that Luis FERNANDEZ thought maybe the fIA already had

_told me to go to Paris, although he was not sure.

I decided to go to Paris because of the mention of Rolando•

The CIA had taken my old Cuban passport when I was In

training In Guatemala and nefer returned 1t.

Also, bacause

I got cauht when I tried to bomb cuba, the INS had warned

me not to travel outside the U.S. saying I gould go to jall

for five years and d cold not get a reentry permit and all

that. However, I checked with and INS officer who knew me,
