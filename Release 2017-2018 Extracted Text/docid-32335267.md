to reinterview Mrg. ELMO HOLLOHAN, 5803 Jackson street,

last Interview of Ars. HOLLOHAN on 10/22/61, she wrote a

letter to the Director in which she indicated she was angry

about being contacted by the FBI. In her letter to the

Director, Mrs. HOLLOHAN stated she joined the "HINUTEMEN"

to see "what they were up to."

she indicated that for the

same reason she subscribed to "The Horker". Hrs. HOLLOKAN

stated that she had not carried out a single assignment

given by the "MINUTEMEN" not because there was anything

at all wrong with this organization but simply because she

did not have the time. She did Indicate that she was a

"chapter leader" in the John Birch Society, which she con-

sidered the "proudest assignnent of my life."

Even though

MES. HOLLOMAN

expressed contidence in the Director, 1t 1
