SUMMARY OF INFORMATION: The Agency Operator advised that Subject was

calling requesting to speak to Mr. Colby.

he wanted to pass to Mr. Colby. Subject was informed that the

Director was not available and that the undersigned would take a

the call.

con man, unscrupulous, wheeler-deeler and a promoter of grandiose
