2.

At 1515 hours on 21 May, the DRE offices in Miami received a

commercial cable in prearranged code indicating the team had arrived

sately in Varadero:

Later, at about 1620 hours, a telephone cali

indicated that the team were in satehouses in lavana since carly

morning 21 May.

On 22 Ma!, a legal traveler,

arrived in Miami and reported

tO DRE OffICes

concerning this operation.

(Subject of a following dispatch.)0l

Jis the safehouse owner who

received the leam, provided

change of clothing, food, shelter, sent

the cable confirming safe arrival and later transported them to Havana.

Subject did not witness, the beach encounter, but heard the fire-fight

reports of the encounter during a visit to the Militia

post the following morning.

The most significant operational factor of this mission is

that the militia post has reported the incident as an 'escape" and

has not suspected that an infiltration operation has taken place.

Therefore,

no search or roadblocks were set up and it can be assumed

that ANHINT safehousing in that area is still intact.

portant. to note that, although conjecture at this point, apparently

the GOC has not

given this clash the propaganda treatment given the

patrol encounter of their CV-28 with the SUSAN. ANN because it was

reported as an "escape" and therefore any casualties inflicted on escapees

would not make sympathetic propaganda.

Also, there were reportedly no

militia casualties to give this clash propaganda value.

This operation was mounted by orders of ANHINT-53 who was

becoming understandably desperate about DRE internal conditions.

Subject had been scheduled for infiltration three times over the past

three months and

cancelled for reasons ranging from mission reception

hazards to renssessment and requirements for further trining.

coming after a long history of DRE internal support problems

obstacles, some of which resulted in costly operational losses and

compromises,

prompted ANHINT-53 to mount the infiltration at any cost.

Subject's primary mission is to identify and confirn appointments

within clandestine apparat at national and provincial levels.

tional losses

through arrest and KIA or execution during past four,

months has resulted in almost two complete turnovers in leadership

at national levels.

His secondary mission is. to organize the National

Reception Committee for materiel supply and infiltration of paramilitary

instructors, radio operators and intelligence agents.

For this purpose

ANHINT-40,

for almost two years,

arrived at a point approximately 20

In order to reach their point at 2200 hours, and reduce daylight exposure

in the sensitive north coast area, they reduced speed and killed time.

Merchant vessels were observed and avoided since it was feared that

position and course might be reported to GOC.

Upon arriving at their launch point, beach conditions were as

expected on this day of traditional festivity.

The small park krown as

'Parque Infantil Ini?", was illuminated and much of the local populace

were dancing in the pavillion.

AMHINT-42 selected a point about 500

yards north of the park and about 500 yards: from their nearest safehouse.
