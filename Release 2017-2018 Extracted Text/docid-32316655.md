area. New Orleans source, however, determined that they had no

such site. Above three individuals also asked New Orleans

source to locate arns and ammunition for shipment to Cuba. ' Davis

is long-time paid informant and has been furnishing information

conceming anti-Castro activities, including activities of Cuban

Revolutionary Council, Henning and training camp in Florida

Everglades. It is probable that Davis was with la Borde and

Hemning gathering information as infomant, but we should check,

this out to be sure. Hemming is soldier of fortune_and mercenary;

La Borde was fornerly of operational interest to CIA!
