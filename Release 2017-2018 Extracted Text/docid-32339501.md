CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM

Last week a series of field conferences held throughout

the country on the Criminal Intelligence Program were concluded.

Representatives of those offices handling the bulk of the Bureau's

case load in the field of organized crime were in attenance.

complete discussion of problems concerning the investigation of

cases in this category was held and many suggestions for improve-

For the information of all offices there follows some

of the high lights of the discussions held at these conferences:

Verbatin Transcripts

connection with our misur coverage, the question of the

necessity for verbatim transcripts of misur information was

raised.

Representatives of many offices felt that in involved

situations, such as our investigations of the skimming

operations

out of the Las Vegas casinos and our investigation

of the underworld organization La Causa Nostra, that verbatim

transcripts were absolutely necessary so that the various field

divisions involved would have the most accurate available

information for assistance in their investigations.

Representa-

tives of other offices maintained that in many instances material

from misurs could be summarized in one communication which would

be suitable for channelization.

The Bureau's position in this

regard is that summarization and channelization of information

from misurs is preferable to extensive verbatim transcripts on

the great majority of intercepts.

However, as noted by some of

the field divisions, where complicated investigations are underway

requiring interpretation of hazy or ambiguous remarks, verbatim

translations are permissible and in those cases desirable.

Every

effort should be made, however, in order to conserve the time of

monitors and typists to utilize, wherever possible, the approved

procedure of summarization and chamelization of the information

into the appropriate files.

Re: Criminal Intelligence Program

Overseas Investigations

Considerable discussion was held concerning the urgent need

for developing information concerning foreign numbered bank

accounts.

The attention of the conferences was directed to

the fact that our Legal Attaches (Legats) are in a position

to be of considerable assistance to the field in this regard.

Our investigations are developing extensive information

concerning the foreign financial activities and travel of

American hoodlums.

Wherever possible, information concerning

such activities should be directed to the Bureau for relay to

the appropriate Legat so that investigation can be initiated

abroad. In this connection, Legats have advised that there

is a great deal of interest

among foreign police circles in

American hoodlum activities and information of this

nature

brought to the attention of the Legats places them in a most

favorable position with reference to the police in the countries

which they cover.

In this connection the attention of the field

is directed to the fact that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police

(RCMP) have recently established a Criminal Intelligence

section at RCHIP Headquarters, Ottawa, and have indicated a

desire to exchange information with the Bureau on matters of

mutual interest in this field.

Informative Indices

The question was again raised in these conferences as to

whether a field office could set up an

informative index

concerning hoodlums active in its territory.

Your attention

is directed to airtel to all SACs dated 5/10/62, captioned

"Criminal Intelligence Program," in which the conditions under

which Bureau approval for such indices would be granted are set

forth.

Monographs

In several of the conferences it was suggested that monographs

to supplement those already in existence and particularly covering

the field of bookmaking and gambling should be prepared for the

assistance of the field divisions in handling substantive gambling

cases.

The San Francisco and Jacksonville Offices were instructed

submit material in this regard and each field division receiving

this communication should submit pertinent material it desires to

have included in such monographs by 4/30/63. Upon receipt of this

information it will be analyzed and appropriate monographs prepared.
