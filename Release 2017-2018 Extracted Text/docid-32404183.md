MEMORANDUM FOR:

FROM:

SUBJECT:

Director of Central Intelligence

Executive Director

Completing Work on JFK Assassination Records

1. Your office has asked whether additional resources are

needed to complete work on the JFK records by the deadline

established by Congress of 22 August 1993. Barring the

unforeseen, we should meet the deadline.

The Historical Review Group expects to complete review of

all hard copy files (some 250,000 pages) by early June.

Since

coordination with the directorates has lagged, we have taken steps

to increase the number of directorate reviewers. The DO has

approximately doubled the number of reviewers to eight. They are

committed

to adding additional resources if required.

3.

The second problem is the need to prepare identification

aids for every document transferred to the National Archives.

have given approval for up to 20 indexers and document analysts to

way overtime on this effort.

4. A potential problem exists in processing a box of.

microfilm, which contains the equivalent of some 172,000 pages of

additional material.

The Historical Review Group believes a large

part consists of duplicates of material already reviewed. They

should know whether this assumption is correct within the next few

days. In any event, I will assign additional resources if needed.

The President has yet to name the Review Board called for

by the JFK Act; theretore,

we cannot determine whether the board

will have additional requirements for us.
