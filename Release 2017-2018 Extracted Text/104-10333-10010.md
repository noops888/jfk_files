RECORDS DISCLOSURE: AN OVERVIEV

SUMMARY

surrounding circumstances by Federal, State, and local authorities as well as

some special inquiry bodies, such as the Presidentially-appointed commissior

•haired by Chief Justice Earl Warren. Later, other official entities, such as the

Jouse Select Committee on Assassinations, probed the assassination anew

records, files, and, in some instances, electronic and multi-media material.

Access to these holdings was sought by various elements of the public for a

multiplicity of reasons. Over time, some unpublished documents were disclosed.

Other holdings, however, for reasons of security classification, law enforcement

investigation, and personal privacy, remained officially sequestered. In 1991, a

filmed dramatization of President Kennedy's assassination heightened public

interest in the tragedy and explanations of its occurrence. Various conspiracy

theories, contentions, and unsubstantiated stories about the event have arisen

during the past 30 years. Because these were troubling to many Americans,

Congress legislated procedures and conditions for the independent review and

expeditious disclosure of heretofore unreleased official recorde relevant to the

assassination of President Kennedy. This was accomplished with the President

John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 which established

a review board to examine all relevant materials with a view to their public

disclosure and maintenance at the National Archives and

Records

Administration for public examination.

PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION

RECORDS DISCLOSURE: AN OVERVIEW

created in 1975, the assassination was tangentially related to or only a part of

their focus. From all of these investigations and examinations there resulted a

cache of data, records, files, and a small quantity of electronic and multi-media

material. Access to these holdings was sought by various elements of the public

for a multiplicity of reasons. Over time, some unpublished documents were

disclosed. Almost all of the Warren Commission records, for example, have been

released. Other holdings, however, for reasons of security classification, law

enforcement investigation, and personal privacy, remained officially sequestered.

A 1991 filmed dramatization of President Kennedy's assassination and

surrounding circumstances heightened public interest in the tragedy and

explanations of its occurrence. Subsequently, former President Gerald Ford, the

only surviving member of the Warren Commission, publicly asked leaders of the

assassination presentatives to seek release di all recorda concerning the

A PRESIDENTIAL ASSASSINATION

The thirty-fifth President of the United States, John Fitzgerald Kennedy,

was shot at approximately 12:30 p.m. on November 22, 1963, while riding in a

motorcade through Dealey Plaza in downtown Dallas, Texas.

President

Kennedy was fatally wounded; Texas Governor John Connally, riding in the

same open automobile with the President, Mrs. Kennedy, and his own wife, was

injured. Doctors at Parkland Memorial Hospital, to which the wounded

President was rushed, quickly discovered he had suffered a massive wound in

the rear portion of his head. Shortly thereafter, at 1:00 p.m. (C.S.T), after all

heart activity had ceased and the Last Rites of the Roman Catholic Church were

administered by a priest, John F. Kennedy was pronounced dead and his demise

was reported by the news media. Most Americans near or at adult age on that

historic and tragic day would forever remember their personal circumstances at

the time of learning about the President's assassination.

Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife were accompanying

President and Mrs. Kennedy on their Dallas visit. At Parkland, the Vice

President was informed of the President's death. Thereafter, he left the hospital

under close guard, and proceeded to the Presidential aircraft, Air Force One,

located at Love Field. On the plane, Lyndon Johnson took the Presidential oath

at 2:38 p.m. (C.S.T.). The aircraft soon departed for Washington, D. C., with

Mrs. Kennedy and the body of the late President aboard.

Air Force One arrived at Andrews Air Force Base outside of Washington at

5:58 p.m. (E.S.T.) and President Kennedy's body was transported to the

National Naval Medical Center in nearby Bethesda, Maryland, where an autopsy

was performed. The following day, the President's body lay in state in the East

Room of the White House. The casket was moved the next day, a Sunday, to

the Capitol where an estimated 300,000 people passed through the Rotunda in

tribute to the fallen Chief Executive. On Monday, in a procession with full

honors, the President's body was moved to Saint Matthew's Roman Catholic

Cathedral for a Pontifical Requiem Mass, and then to Arlington National

Cemetery for burial.

Meanwhile, on the day of the President's assassination, Dallas Police

arrested a suspect in the killing, Lee Harvey Oswald, who was also a suspect in

the shooting of a patrolman. When questioned by Dallas officers, as well as

agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Secret

Service, Oswald denied having anything to do with the murder of President

Kennedy or the Dallas policeman. He was subsequently advised formally at 7:10

p.m. on November 22 that he was charged with the slaying of the patrolman.

Several hours later, shortly after 1:30 a.m. on the following day, Oswald was

also charged with assassinating President Kennedy. The next day, Sunday, as

Oswald was being transferred from the city jail to an armored truck which was

to transport him to the Dallas County Jail, he was suddenly shot by an assailant

at approximately 11:20 a.m., in the glaring light of television news cameras. He

quickly lost consciousness, was rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital, and was

pronounced dead at 1:07 p.m.

Oswald's assassin was Jack Ruby, a local nightelub operator. Arrested at

ne scene and jalled by Dallas police, Ruby told interrogators that he had kille

swald in a temporary fit of depression and rage over President Kennedy'

death. He denied having any prior connection with Oswald or any involvement

in the President's killing. Indicted by the State of Texas for Oswald's murder

on November 26, 1963, Ruby was found guilty on March 14, 1964, and was

sentenced to death. On appeal, the verdict was reversed and a new trial was

ordered by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on October 5, 1966. However,

while awaiting retrial, Jack Ruby died of cancer at Parkland Memorial Hospital

on January 3, 1967.

OFFICIAL INVESTIGATIONS

The assassination of President Kennedy was investigated or examined

immediately by Texas police authorities as well as the Federal Bureau of

Investigation and the United States Secret Service, and, subsequently, other

Federal entities. A special study commission, chaired by Chief Justice Earl

Warren, was impaneled by President Johnson with a directive, E.O. 11130 of

November 30, 1963.*

At least one other such body the Commission to

Investigate CIA Activities Within the United States, chaired by Vice President

Nelson Rockefeller and established with E.O. 11828 of January 4, 19756-also

explored aspects of the Kennedy assassination. Between 1975 and 1978, two

special congressional committees the Senate Select Committee to Study

Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, which was

chaired by Senator Frank Church, and the House Select Committee on

Assassinations, which was principally chaired by Representative Louis

Stokes also reviewed the Kennedy assassination.

The various investigations, examinations, and reviews of the assassination

of President Kennedy resulted in the production and collection of a vast

quantity of records and evidentiary materials by Federal entities. The Warren

Commission, for example, generated its own original records and received

pertinent materials from Federal agencies, such as the F.B.I. The Commission's

research, records, and evidence were later reviewed by the House Select

Committee on Assassinations, which itself generated original records and

received additional material from other official and unofficial sources.

Consequently, due to the manner and timeframes in which Federal inquiries

into and reviews of President Kennedy's assassination were conducted, most

collections of records on the matter held by Federal entities contained

documentary materials that were produced by sources other than themselves.

In brief, there were Federal records that were shared on both an inter- and

Federal Bureau of Investigation. The f.B.l. holdings include 499,451 pages

of pertinent documents, 223,689 pages of which have been made available to the

public. During congressional testimony in May of 1992, the Bureau's Deputy

Director indicated that a special task force had been created a few weeks earlier

to expedite greater disclosure of records relating to the assassination.® He also

provided the following breakdown of F.B.I. records "relating in some way to the

assassination."

1. The FBI has four "core files" that relate directly to the investigation

of the assassination, our cooperation with the Warren Commission,

and the investigations of Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby. There

are approximately 499,000 pages in these files. Because of the very

liberal standards used for processing these documents, most of the

iniormation in these files was released pursuant to the Freedom of

Information Act in 1978 and is available in the FBI's public reading

room. . ..

2. In addition, the FBI has several other much smaller files as a result

of other related investigations such as the investigation of Marina

Oswald [the wife of Lee Harvey Oswald]. These files comprise

approximately 22,000 pages.

.. (M)uch of this information has

already been released to the public.®

United States Secret Seruce. The Secret Service collection consists of

approximately 11,000 pages of records, as well as several audio-visual items,

almost all of which are duplicated in the publicly available holdings of the

Warren Commission. Scattered records have been exempted from disclosure

under the Freedom of Information Act in the past for reasons of security

classification, personal privacy, and law enforcement investigation. lo

Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Intelligence Community. The

C.I.A. compiled a file on Lee Harvey Oswald before the assassination of

President Kennedy. That material was made public in mid-May of 1992." The

C.I.A. has approximately 250,000 to 300,000 pages of additional pertinent

material, about 11,000 pages of which have been made public through F.O.I. Act

requests. In his May 1992, testimony before the Senate Committee on

Governmental Affairs concerning proposed legislation providing for the

expeditious disclosure of records pertaining to the assassination of President

Kennedy, the Director of Central Intelligence summarized relevant actions he

had recently taken, saying:

Two months ago, I announced the establishment of a new unit within

CIA that will be responsible for declassifying as many historical

documents as possible consistent with the protection of intelligence

sources and methode. 12

This new unit, the Historical Review Group, in the Agency's

Center for the Study of Intelligence, will review for declassification

documents 30 years old or older and national intelligence estimates on

the former Soviet Union that are 10 years old or older. Is

In addition to the systematic review of 30-year-old documents, I

have directed the history staff in the Center for the Study of

Intelligence to assemble CIA records focusing on particular events of

historical importance, including the assassination of President

Kennedy.

The Historical Review Group will then examine the

documents for the purpose of declassifying the records.

Because of high interest in the JFK papers, I am not waiting for

egislation or other agencies to start declassitying documents belongin

begun its review of the documente related to the assassination of

President Kennedy, and I am happy to report that the first group of

these records, including all CIA documents on Lee Harvey Oswald

prior to the assassination, has been declassified with quite minimal

Describing the Agency's assassination records holdings in a prepared

statement, the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence told a House

subcommittee:

This includes 64 boxes of copies and originals of information provided

Assassinations and 17 boxes of material on Lee Harvey Oswald

Concerning other agencies of the Federal Intelligence Community, the

Deputy Director's statement said:

The FBI will describe its holdings separately, which I assume include

both intelligence and law enforcement records. The National Security

Agency and the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and

Research report, after a preliminary search, that they have identified

a relatively small amount of material responsive to previous inquiries

by the Warren Commission, the Church Committee, and the House

Select Committee on Assassinations. The Defense Intelligence Agency,

which did not come into existence until 1961, has identified no

assassination material to date, and it anticipates that any holdings it

might have would be minimal because its mission at the time of the

Kennedy assassination focused upon foreign order of battle. 16

Department of State. According to supplemental material accompanying the

Archivist's May, 1992, testimony before a subcommittee of the House Committee

on the Judiciary, some 7,000 pages of pertinent records in two case files had

been recently transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration

by the Department of State. Although this collection had not been

systematically reviewed at the time of his testimony, the account indicated that

the transferred documents appeared to be duplicates of those in the publicly

available holdings of the Warren Commission. "7

Department of Justice. Apart from the records of the F.B.I. noted earlier,

case files of the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice reportedly

contain approximately 65,000 pages of material. According to the supplemental

account accompanying the Archivist's prepared statement for a subcommittee

of the House Committee on the Judiciary, "Most of these records are letters from

the general public, constituent mail forwarded by members of Congress, and

responses from the Department and the F'BI." Some 11,000 pages of this

material have been previously exempted from disclosure for reasons of personal

privacy and law enforcement investigation when sought pursuant to the F.O.I.

President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy. The

Warren Commission presented its report and 26 volumes of appendices to

the Government Printing Office and made available for public purchase. The

Commission ceased operations and its records 363 cubic feet of material,

including audio-visual itemswere transferred to the National Archives.

Approximately 98 percent of this collection subsequently has become open to the

Commission to Investigate CIA Activities Within the United States.

Mandated to determine whether any C.IA. domestic activities exceeded the

Agency's statutory authority, the Rockefeller Commission was tasked, within its

general mission, to investigate allegations concerning the presence of C.I.A.

employees or agents in Dallas at the time of President Kennedy's assassination

or of their involvement in the murder. The panel's June 16, 1975, report, while

indicating that a staff inquiry had been made concerning the allegations, noted

that "a full review" of the report of the Warren Commission had not been

undertaken.

"Such a task," in the panel's view, "would have been outside of the

scope of the Executive Order establishing this Commission, and would have

diverted the time of the Commission from its proper function." Consequently,

the panel limited itself "to determining whether there was any credible evidence

ointing to CIA involvement in the assassination of President Kennedy "20 It

oncluded that "there was no credible evidence of any CIA involvement. "21

Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to

Intelligence Activities (The Church Committee). Established by S. Res. 21 on

January 27, 1975, the Church Committee was tasked with conducting an

investigation of the extent, if any, of improper or unethical activities engaged

in by Federal intelligence agencies. In carrying out its mandate, the Committee

assessed the performance of the intelligence community in examining

circumstances surrounding the assassination of President Kennedy. The

Committee subsequently "developed evidence which impeaches the process by

which the intelligence agencies arrived at their own conclusions about the

assassination" and found that the intelligence agencies were "deficient" in their

support of the Warren Commission.2 When the Church Committee went out

of existence on May 31, 1976, its records came under the custody and into the

end of the 95th Congress, custody of its records passed to the Clerk of the

House. Approximately 414,000 pages of the Committee's 747,000-page collection

were created or collected by the panel's Kennedy task force. The operative

House standard at the time of the expiration of the Assassinations Committee

sealed all unpublished committee records for 50 years. A 1983 effort by five

former members of the Assassinations Committee to accelerate the release of the

panel's files was unsuccessful due to the failure of their reform resolution (H.

Res. 160) to be reported from committee.

RECORDS ACCESS BARRIERS

Efforts by the public to gain access to records deriving from Federal

investigations and examinations of the assassination of President Kennedy and

surrounding events have been frustrated by several complications. Operative

since July of 196%, the Freedom of Information Act provides any

person-individual or corporate, regardless of citizenship-with access to

identifiable, unpublished, existing records of the Federal departments and

agencies without having to demonstrate a need or even a reason for such a

request.?? The burden of proof for withholding material sought by the public

is placed upon the Government. However, the statute specifies nine categories

of information which may be withheld from disclosure.2 Among these stated

exemptions to the rule of disclosure are protections for: (1) information properly

classified for national defense or foreign policy purposes as secret under criteria

established by an executive order; (2) data specifically excepted from disclosure

by a statute which either requires that matters be withheld in a non-

discretionary manner or which establishes particular criteria for withholding or

refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; (3) personnel, medical, and

similar files the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion

of personal privacy; and (4) certain kinds of investigatory records compiled for

law enforcement purposes.?* These four exemptions tended to be the ones

most often invoked by the agencies in support of their withholding of

assassination materials sought pursuant to the F.O.I. Act. Disputes over the

accessibility of records may be ultimately settled in Federal court.

Among those testifying before the Senate Committee on Governmental

Affairs during that panel's consideration of legislation providing for the

expeditious disclosure of records relevant to the assassination of President

Kennedy was James H. Lesar, an F.O.lA. attorney and president of the

Assassination Archives and Research Center located in Washington, D. C.

Describing the Center as "a private, non-profit organization which collects,

preserves,

and disseminates information and materials on political

assassinations,... which is funded by membership dues and donations from the

public," Mr. Lesar identified the security classification of assassination records

as a major obstacle to their release under the F.O.I. Act. He also gave some

illustrations from his practice showing "the inadequacies of the FOIA and the

enormous frustration which accrues to those who attempt to use it to obtain

information about the Kennedy assassination. These examples," he told the

Committee, "reveal a pattern of delay, costly litigation, and untrue

representations by the Government. 30 In conclusion, he said:

These stories that I have related are unusual only because the

requesters actually went to court to fight the CIA and FBI. Most

requesters cannot afford the time or money to litigate their FOIA

requests against these agencies. You might be tempted to conclude

from the general absence of litigation that the FOlA is working just

ine. The opposite is true. The FOIA has been severely damaged by

che 1984 amendments eliminating access to CIA operational files

and by the 1986 amendments to Exemption 7 which applies to law

enforcement records,32 as well as by a string of decisions in the

Supreme Court and the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of

Columbia which have greatly expanded the amount of material which

can be withheld from the public. "

Public access to unpublished congressional records was also very limited.

The House Select Committee on Assassinations went out of existence at the

expiration of the 95th Congress. During its two-year investigation, the Select

Committee amassed approximately 414,000 pages of records pertaining to the

30 U. S. Congress.

Kennedy assassination.* Transcripts of its open hearings and a final report

were published by the Government Printing Office. However, ite other records

remained unavailable to the public. These materials were transferred to the

National Archives and were sealed from public access for 50 years, until the year

2029, in accordance with the operative standards of the House of

Representatives at that time.36

Despite this time restriction on public access to the Select Committee's

unpublished records, interested persons could request to see them by writing to

the Clerk of the House. Although there was unlike the provisions of the F.O.I.

Act no temporal requirement concerning a response deadline, it was at least

the Clerk's policy to reply in a timely manner, whether the response was

positive or negative. However, because security classified material and agency

records were a large part of this reserved collection, access was accordingly

limited. Furthermore, there was a logistical question of permitting access at the

legislative reference branch of the National Archives or retrieving the records

for examination on Capitol Hill, with appropriate supervision in either case. In

brief, it was not a satisfying experience for many requestors.

In 1983, a former member of the Select Committee, Representative Stewart

McKinney, citing the public's right to know about the circumstances

surrounding the death of President Kennedy, introduced a resolution, H. Res.

160, providing for the accelerated release of the panel's files. Four other

members of the Select Committee Representatives Robert Edgar, Harold S.

Sawyer, Walter Fauntroy, and Harold Ford co-sponsored the resolution.

Referred to the House Administration Committee, it never came to the House

floor for a vote; and, although hearings were held on the proposal, the transcript

was not published.

In the Senate, the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations

with Respect to Intelligence Activities known as the Church Committee, which

was established on January 27, 1975- examined various aspects of intelligence

community operations, including its performance in assisting in investigations

of the assassination of President Kennedy. Specifically, the Church Committee

studied the extent to which the intelligence agencies assisted the Warren

Commission by providing information necessary to conduct its investigation.

The Church Committee found that the intelligence community did not

provide sufficient data to the Warren Commission about U.S. operations against

Cuba.

Furthermore, it recommended that its successor, the Senate Select

Committee on Intelligence, investigate the possibility that senior officials of the

C.L.A. and F.B.1. might have made a conscious decision not to disclose potentially

important information in this area to the Warren Commission. Before the

Church Committee went out of existence on May 31, 1976, it forwarded all of

its files pertaining to this aspect of its investigation approximately 5,000 page

of records to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence."

When the Church Committee concluded its investigation and published its

hearing transcripts and final report, there was no Senate rule governing the

disposition of committee records. In practice, each committee had its own

agreement with the National Archives concerning noncurrent materials. On

June 24, 1980, the Senate adopted a resolution, S. Res. 474, which provided that

any records of the Senate, or of any Senate committee, shall not be available to

the public for 20 years and, in the case of investigative files, for 50 years.

A third area of access difficulties concerns donated papers records provided

to the Federal Government under a deed of gift setting temporal or other access

conditions which restrict their availability to the general public. In testimony

before a subcommittee of the House Committee on the Judiciary, the Archivist

of the United States offered the following pertinent remarks:

In accordance with 44 U.S.C. 2107 and 2111, the National Archives

has accepted under deed of gift a wide variety of historical, donated

historical materials. The Kennedy autopsy photographs and x-rays are

in this category. So are the files of the Rockefeller Commission held

by the Gerald R. Ford Library. This donation was in keeping with

legal practices prior to 1978 when the Presidential commissions were

regarded as personal to the President because they provided advice

directly to him.

The deed of gift for this highly classified Rockefeller Commission

ile specifies that access will be granted for any legitimat

governmental function. Access has been granted for at least thre

previous governmental investigations....

In addition, there are collections of personal papers in some of the

Presidential libraries received under the authority of 44 U.S.C. 2107

and 2111, and they may contain documentary materials falling within

the broad definition of assassination materials.88

The Library of Congress also had relevant donated papers in its manuscript

collections, some of which were accessible to the public only with the permission

of the donor. 89

While the difficulties of gaining donor permission to examine private

records deposited in public institutions were well understood, the Archivist

offered a caution concerning access legislation which might override donor

agreements involving assassination materials. The National Archives, he said,

"is concerned that unless existing donation agreements are honored and donors

are consulted before access and publication, the Congress may inadvertently

discourage future donations of similar historical material and thereby damage

Legislation providing for the expeditious disclosure of records relevant to

the assassination of President Kennedy was introduced in the House as H. J.

Res: 454 on March 26, 1992, by Representative Louis Stokes, former chairman

of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, with 40 initial co-sponsors.11

In testimony before a subcommittee of the House Committee on the Judiciary

considering the proposal, Representative Stokes explained his reasons for

offering the legislation.

This resolution was introduced because of the renewed public

interest and concern over the records pertaining to the assassination

of President John F. Kennedy.

The House committee which I chaired, in the course of its

investigation, had at one time or the other in ite possession

approximately 370 cubic feet of files. Among the materials contained

in these files were classified and unclassified materials on loan from

Federal agencies, materials generated by committee staff, materials on

loan from private individuals, transcripts of committee open session

meetings and meetings, and from executive easions hearings and

There has been considerable debate about these records, including

accusations that these records, if released, would contain evidence of

a gavination coredent Kennicity of government agencies in the

I can assure you, Mr. Chairman, members of this committee, that

othing could be further from the truth. No member of our committe

or member of our staff participated in any coverup of the truth

Mr. Chairman, I am committed to the principle that Americans

are entitled to know the truth about the assassination of President

Kennedy and feel that Congress should do its best to allay fears of the

American people in this regard.

The American public deserves to

history he factual truth about thie important event in this Nation's

An identical companion measure was introduced in the Senate as S. J. Res.

In sponsoring the legislation, Senator Boren said, in both his floor statement

introducing the measure and later committee hearings on it, he felt, as a general

principle, that "the intelligence community should make available its records

after the passage of a reasonable amount of time when current sources and

methods would no longer be compromised. "44

As introduced, the Assassination Materials Disclosure Act provided for the

creation of a temporary Assassination Materials Review Board. It was to be

composed of five "distinguished and impartial private citizens," who were to be

selected by the division of the United States Court of Appeals for the District

of Columbia established under 28 U.S.C. 49. This section originally mandated

the selection of so-called Independent Counsels or Special Prosecutors, such as

the ones who lately have pursued illegalities stemming from the Watergate

incident and the Iran-Contra affair. According to the Stokes-Boren proposal,

members of the Review Board were to be deemed to be inferior officers of the

United States within the meaning of section 2 of Article Il of the

Constitution. Furthermore, the Review Board was authorized to, "without

regard to the civil service laws and regulations, appoint and terminate an

Executive Director and such other additional personnel as are necessary to

enable the Review Board to perform its duties."

The Assassination Materials Disclosure Act prescribed that all relevant

records and materials pertinent to the assassination of President Kennedy would

be initially reviewed by the Executive Director of the Review Board. This

official would determine if items (1) could be publicly released; (2) should be

referred to the Board, for reasons of privacy or other complex conditions, for a

determination as to their public availability; or (3) should be postponed for

release, subject to Review Board approval. In the first instance, decisions by the

Executive Director to release materials could be appealed by agencies to the

Review Board for reconsideration. Ultimately, the Review Board would decide

(1) the disclosure of materials, subject to a Presidential override, with notice to

the public and Congress; and (2) postponement of release to a specific date, with

notice to the public and Congress.

- In the House, H. J. Res. 454 was referred jointly to the Committees on

House Administration, Government Operations, Rules, and the Judiciary. Two

panels, the Committees on Government Operations and the Judiciary, held

public hearings, conducted mark-ups, and issued reports on differing versions

of the original proposal,16 In the Senate, S. J. Res. 282 was referred only to

the Committee on Governmental Affairs, which held a hearing on the measure,

revised and expanded it, and reported this new version (S. 3006).47 Various

objections to the original text of the joint resolution were heard by the

committees, including those of the Department of Justice, which indicated the

proposal, as introduced, "would not be consistent with the objectives of the

Administration. "48 Among the criticisms of the proposal that were offered by

witnesses were the following:

• using a somewhat unusual and constitutionally suspect process for the

appointment of Review Board members (to achieve independence)

instead of the more traditional procedure of Presidential appointment

and Senate confirmation of such officials;

vesting too much responsibility and discretionary authority (and

perhaps too much work) in the Executive Director of the Review

Board, who might also more properly be a Presidential appointee;

insulating from the President the decisions of the Review Board

concerning the public release of heretofore undisclosed executive

branch records, limiting the President's authority to protect such

records to the standards set forth in the legislation, and requiring,

contrary to the separation of powers doctrine, that the President

submit to Congress copies of any assassination material that he blocks

from release by the Review Board; and

* defining "assassination material" so broadly that agencies are not

forded adequate guidance for determining practical limits to th

universe of relevant records, so loosely that custodial rights governin

some materials, such as executive branch records found in the

collections of pertinent House and Senate investigating committees,

are overlooked, and so imprecisely that relevant materials of the

Rockefeller Commission on CIA Activities Within the United States

escape coverage.

The Senate version of the legislation, revised and reported by the

Committee on Governmental Affairs as The President John F. Kennedy

Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (S. 3006), was approved on July 22,

1992.4 Disagreements over the differing provisions of two reported revisions

of the measure delayed final action in the House, ' which passed a version on

August 12 relying upon the selection of Review Board members pursuant to the

Independent Counsel authority (28 U.S.C. 49),61 However, conferees were not

quickly appointed and the House-passed measure was not formally sent to the

Senate until September 21 when the 102d Congress was rapidly moving toward

final adjournment. With time running out, the House adopted the Senate-

passed bill on September 30.

"avoids the chief constitutional problems raised by earlier versions of the bill,"

the President noted that "it still raises several constitutional questions." These

were enumerated as follows:

First, S. 3006 sets forth the grounds on which the release of

documents may be postponed, but this list does not contemplate

nondisclosure of executive branch deliberations or law enforcement

information of the executive branch, and it provides only a narrow

basis for nondisclosure of national security information. My authority

o protect these categories of information comes from the Constitutio

nd cannot be limited by statute

Although only the most

extraordinary circumstances would require postponement of the

disclosure of documents for reasons other than those recognized in the

ill, I cannot abdicate my constitutional responsibility to take such

action when necessary. The same applies to the provision purportin

to give certain congressional committees "access to any records held or

created by the Review Board." This provision will be interpreted

consistently with my authority under the Constitution to protect

confidential executive branch materials and to supervise and guide

executive branch officials.

Second, S. 3006 requires the Board to report to the President and

the Congress. If the bill were interpreted to require simultaneous

reports, S. 3006 would intrude upon the President's authority to

supervise subordinate officials in the executive branch. I will construe

the provisions to require that the Board report to the President before

it reports to the Congress.

Third, the bill purports to set the qualifications for Board

members, to require the President to review lists supplied by specified

organizations, and to direct the timing of nominations. These

provisions conflict with the constitutional division of responsibility

between the President and the Congress. The President has the sole

power of nomination; the Senate has the sole power of consent.

I note also that S. 3006 provides that, upon request of the Board,

courts may enforce subpoenas that the Attorney General has issued at

the Board's urging. I sign this bill on the understanding that this

provision does not encroach upon the Attorney General's usual,

plenary authority to represent the agencies of the United States,

including the Board, whenever they appear in court.66

STATUTE OVERVIEW

As enacted into law, the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records

Collection Act of 1992 generally provides for the independent review of

government recorde relating to the assassination of President Kennedy with a

view to their public release. Furthermore, it requires the assembly of copies of

all such records, whether available for public examination now or at a later time,

in a special collection maintained by the National Archives and Records

Administration. However, it does not take precedence over deede governing

access to, or transfer or release of, gifts and donations of records to the United

States Government. The Archivist is directed to begin establishing the Kennedy

assassination records collection not later than 60 days after the enactment of the

statute, and is responsible for ensuring the physical integrity, original

Continuing oversight

surveitice, id sesuit to this recorde collection is Ventin in the House

Committee on Government Operations and the Senate Committee on

Governmental Affairs.

The statute indicates that, as soon as practicable after its enactment, each

Government office shall begin identifying and organizing their records relating

to the assassination of President Kennedy and preparing for their transmission

to the Archivist for inclusion in the special collection. In so doing, offices are

directed not to destroy, alter, or mutilate any such record or withhold, react,

postpone for subsequent disclosure, or reclassify any assassination record

previously made available or disclosed to the public. However, not later than

300 days after the enactment of the statute, Government offices shall begin a

review to identify records in their custody or possession which are actually

assassination records. Of these, they are also to determine which ones have

been previously disclosed officially or made available publicly in a complete and

unredacted form, which ones were produced by a third agency or another

Government office (and transmit same or copies of same to these parties), and

which ones are covered by the standards for postponement of public disclosure

under the Kennedy assassination records collection statute. Previously released

assassination records and information are provided to the Archivist for the

special collection.

Materials which aré of uncertain statue as to being

assassination records or which a Government office has determined are

assassination records which may be postponed, in whole or in part, for public

disclosure, are to be organized and made available to the Assassination Kecords

Review Board established by the statute.

The disclosure of assassination records, in whole or in part, may be

postponed "if there is clear and convincing evidence that

conduct of intelligence activities; or

(C) any other matter currently relating to the

national security of the United States;

(2) the public disclosure of the assassination record

would reveal the name or identity of a living person who

provided confidential information to the United States and

would pose a substantial risk of harm to that person;

(3) the public disclosure of the assassination record

could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted

invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of privacy ie

so substantial that it outweighs the public interest;

(4) the public disclosure of the assassination record

would compromise the existence of an understanding of

confidentiality currently requiring protection between a

Government agent and a cooperating individual or a foreign

government, and public disclosure would be so harmful that

it outweighs the public interest; or

(5) the public disclosure of the assassination record

vould reveal a security or protective procedure currentl

atilized, or reasonably expected to be utilized, by the Secre

Service or another Government agency responsible for

protecting Government officials, and the public disclosure

vould be so harmful that it outweighs the public interest.

I'he statute establishes a temporary independent agency, to be known a

he Assassination Records Review Board. This panel is composed of five

citizens, who are to be appointed by the President "after considering persons

recommended by the American Historical Association, the Organization of

American Historians, the Society of American Archivists, and the American Bar

Association." These appointees are subject to Senate confirmation, "shall be

granted the necessary security clearances in an accelerated manner subject to

the standard procedures for granting such clearances," and "shall qualify for the

necessary security clearance prior to being considered for confirmation by the

Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate."*7 A vacancy on the Board

is to be filled in the same manner as an original appointment. Board members

may be removed only for specific cause; a removed member may obtain judicial

review of the action through civil suit in the District Court for the District of

Columbia and may be reinstated or granted other appropriate relief by order of

the court.

Board members elect a chair from among themselves at their initial

meeting. They serve for the total period of the Board's functioning two years

from the date of the enactment of the Kennedy assassination records collection

statute, with a possible one-year extension of this mandate if the Board

members, by majority vote, determine that such additional time is needed in

order to complete their work. In general, the duties of the Review Board are to

"consider and render decisions" on determinations by Government offices as to

whether or not materials constitute assassination records and whether or not

an assassination record, in whole or in part, qualifies for postponement of

disclosure under the statute. In performing these duties, the Board is

empowered to exercise certain authority, including: directing Government offices

to complete records identification aids and to organize assassination records;

obtaining access to assassination records that have been identified and organized

by a Government office; requiring a Government office to account in writing for

the destruction of assassination records; and obtaining from Government offices

and the public such additional information, records, or testimony as may be

needed to fulfill the Board's functions and responsibilities under the statute.

The Board is authorized to hold hearings, administer oaths, subpoena witnesses

and documents, and issue interpretive regulations.

The Review Board appoints and is assisted by an Executive Director and a

staff. Each of these individuals "shall be a private citizen of integrity and

impartiality who is not a present employee of any branch of the Government

and who has had no previous involvement with any official investigation or

inquiry relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy." In addition,

the Executive Director is to be "a distinguished professional."* All supporting

personnel must satisfy the requirements for necessary security clearances. The

Executive Director may be removed by the Board for specific cause. Other staff

members, who may be hired without regard to civil service law and regulation

for competitive service, apparently may be removed by the Board as it deems

necessary. The Board is also authorized to create such advisory committees as

it may need to assist it in fulfilling its responsibilities.

Not later than 90 days after its members are appointed, the Review Board

must publish in the Federal Register a schedule for the review of all

assassination records and, not later than 180 days after the enactment of the

segregable portions, substitutes, or summaries of the document. These efforts

are to be reported to the Archivist.

Upon determining that an assassination record shall be publicly disclosed,

contrary to the judgment of a Government office, or postponed for disclosure

and held in protected status within the special collection maintained by the

National Archives, the Review Board notifies the head of the originating body

of its determination and publishes a copy of its ruling in the Federal Register

within 14 days after making its decision. Contemporaneous notice of the

determination is also made to the President regarding executive branch records

and to the statute's oversight committees in the case of legislative branch

materials. This notice is to include a written, unclassified justification for public

disclosure or postponement of disclosure, including an explanation of the

made to the praire in the case utication, For pal

application of any of the postponement standarde specified in the statute.

Within 30 days after receiving the Review Board's determination and

notice, the President may override the Board's decision regarding executive

branch records probably by imposing a postponement of disclosure or setting

a longer postponement period than prescribed by the Board. In so doing, the

President provides the Review Board with an unclassified, written certification

of his action and the justification for same, including the applicable grounds for

postponement as specified in the Kennedy assassination records collection

statute.

The Review Board subsequently publishes this Presidential

certification, upon receipt, in the Federal Register along with any accompanying

statement or other materials transmitted by or on behalf of the President with

regard to postponement of the disclosure of assassination records.

The Review Board is required to publish periodic notices in the Federal

Register summarizing postponements of assassination records disclosures. It is

also obligated to issue approximately yearly reports concerning its activities and

operations. The statute also indicates that the Board may enlist the assistance

of the Attorney General in pursuit of the release of information relevant to the

assassination of President Kennedy that is held under court seal or an

injunction of secrecy of a grand jury. Another provision states that the

Secretary of State should contact the government of the Republic of Russia "and

any other foreign government that may hold information relevant to the

assassination of President Kennedy and seek disclosure of such information."

for greater disclosure of its holdings pertaining to the assassinated President,

reportedly is in the process of releasing information contained in 248 hours of

secretly taped Oval Office conversations and 12 hours of recorded telephone

This joint resolution may be cited as the "Assassina-

4 SEC. & FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.- The Congress finds the following:

(1) Legitimate confidentiality concerns based

upon national security, personal privacy, law en-

forcement, and other recognized interests diminish

over time.

(2) There is a compelling public interest that all

government records be eventually made available to

the public.

(3) There is a compelling publie interest that all

materials concerning the assassination of President

John F. Kennedy be made available to the public at

- the earliest possible date.

(1) Executive Order 12356, National Security

Information, as implemented by the executive

branch, has precluded the timely release of materials

relating to the assassination of President Kennedy.

(5) Section 552 of title 5, United States Code

(popularly known as the "Freedom of Information

Act"), as implemented by the executive branch, has

failed to secure the timely release of materials relat-

ing to the assassination of President Kennedy.

15

ment.

(10) The disclosure of records in the possession

(1) The threat to the military defense, intel-

ligence operations, or conduct of foreign relations of

the United States posed by the public availability of

the assassination material is of such gravity that it

outweighs the public interest in disclosure of the as-

sassination material, and such public availability

would reveal

(A) an intelligence agent whose identity

currently requires protection;

(B) an intelligence source or method which

is currently utilized or reasonably expected to

be utilized by the United States Government

and which has not been officially disclosed, and

the disclosure of which would interfere with the

demonstrably impair the national security of

the United States.

(2) The public availability of the assassination

material would disclose the name or identity of a liv-

ing person who provided confidential information to

the United States and would pose a substantial risk

of harm to such person.

(3) The public availability of the assassination

material could reasonably be expected to constitute

an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and

that invasion of privacy is so substantial that it out-

weighs the public interest in disclosure of the assas-

sination material.

(4) The public availability of the assassination

material would constitute an unjustified violation of

an express, documented understanding of con-

fidentiality between & Government agent and a co-

operating individual of a foreign government,

(5) The public availability of the assassination

material would disclose a security or protective pro-

cedure currently utilized, or reasonably expected to

be utilized, by the Secret Service or another Govern-

ment agency responsible for protecting Government

officials, and that public availability would be so

harmful that it outweighs the public interest.

Office of Congressional Affairs

Assassination Disclosure Act of 1992

1.

Attached for your review and comment is the Joint

Resolution introduced yesterday by Congressman Stokes and

Senator Boren that would establish procedures for declassifying

out catap

records related to the assassination of JEK.

The Resolution in

the House will be referred to the Rules Committee, Government

Operations Committee and the Judiciary Committee.

In the

Senate, the Resolution will be referred to Government Affairs

Committee.

2 .

The Resolution has the following key elements:

a. It establishes an Assassination Material Review

Board composed of five private citizens, appointed by the

D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and mandates that all

executive agencies turn any assassination material they may

possess over to the Executive Director of the Board.

Unless there is clear and convincing evidence that the

material falls within certain stated exemptions, the

Executive Director would then turn the material over to the

Archivist for release to the public. An executive agency

may appeal to the Review Board the decision by the

Executive Director to release assassination material.

Disclosure of information may be postponed if it

would reveal an intelligence agent; an intelligence

source

or method which is currently utilized or reasonably

expected to be utilized, by the US Government; or any

matter currently relating to military defense, intelligence

operations or the conduct of foreign relations of the US

and the threat posed by disclosure of such information

outweighs any public interest in the disclosure. Other

grounds for postponing disclosure include invasion of the

privacy of a living person, breach of a promise of

confidentiality, and disclosure of a security or protective

procedure used by the Secret Service.

c. Any material that falls within the above stated

categories would be referred by the Executive Director to

the Review Board which would then make a decision whether

to release the document in full or in part.

The

presumption would be in favor of releasing the documents,

unless

the Board determined that there was clear and

convincing evidence that the document was protected by the

exemptions.

The Review Board would also have the option of

releasing to the public a summary of the document, or

inserting substitutions for information that otherwise

could not be released.

d. An executive agency is given 60 days to appeal to

the President a decision by the Review Board to release a

record, particular information in a record, a summary of a

record or a substitution for particular information.

President may prevent the Review Board from releasing the

material if he certifies that the materials falls within

exemptions described above.

The President may not delegate

this authority,

and must submit to the appropriate

committee in the House and to the SSCI a written statement

setting forth the reasons for denying release of the

information and a complete copy of the material at issue.

In addition, the President must publish in the Federal

Resister notice sate stake see asiat and a

material at issue. The Executive Branch is not given any

opportunity to appeal a decision to release material

loriginated by the House, Senate or Warren Commission.

e.

Whenever a final decision has been made to

postpone release of material, the Review Board is required

to-turn the information over

to the Archivist along with a

statement as to a specific time or specific occurrence that

trigger reconsideration of the decision not to

release the material.

The Archivist would then be placed

under a continuing duty to review the material for release

to the public.

f.

The Review Board may subpoena assassination

material from agencies and compel the attendance of

witnesses at hearings.

Subpoenas may be enforced in

The term of the Review Board shall

Central intelligence Agency

DRAFT

Washington D C 20505

CIA SPECIAL COLLECTIONS

RELEASE IN FULL

2000

13 April 1992.

Mr.

Bernard H. Martin

Assistant Director for

Legislative Reference

Office of Management and Budget

Washington, D.C.

20503

Dear Mr. Martin:

This is in

response to your request for the views of the

Central Intelligence Agency on Senate Joint Resolution 282, the

"Assassination Materials Disclosure Act of 1992", and the

corresponding House Joint Resolution 454 ("the resolutions").

The Central Intelligence Agency fully supports the

fundamental premise underlying this legislation--that efforts

should be made to declassify and make available to the public

as expeditiously as possible government documents relating to

the assassination of President Kennedy. In fact, the Director

of Central Intelligence (DCI) has recently established and

staffed

new unit within CIA responsible for review and

declassification of documents of historical interest, including

the JFK-related files, as part of the Agency's program of

increased openness.

However, several provisions of the

resolutions raise serious concerns, as outlined below, and CIA

cannot support them as currently drafted. Cur comments will

focus upon specific CIA concerns; many general issues raised by

the resolutions are better addressed by the White House or the

Department of Justice.

Initially, the resolutions are focussed on "records" rather

than the information contained in them.

We are concerned that

the Agency would not have the opportunity to object to release

of CIA information contained in documents originated by

Congress or the Warren Commission.

documents originated by these entities can be released by the

Executive Director of the Assassination Materials Review Board

without any review by the President or other Executive Branch

agencies. Similarly, there is no mechanism that would allow

---

## Page 106

14-00009

Letter to Mr. Bernard H. Martin

the Agency to object to release of its information contained in

documents originated by other agencies or

departments.

The

cesolutions should provide that the agencies which originate

information

have the opportunity to review that information

she the orde

prior to its release. Otherwise, an anomalous situation could

be created in which documents originated by the Executive

Branch would be withheld while documents originated by Congress

containing the same Executive branch information would be

released.

The

• resolutions' broad definition of assassination

material" is also troublesome.

The resolutions define

"assassination material® as

record that relates "in any

manner or degree to the assassination.*

This unbounded

definition could cover a range of material beyond that which

has been traditionally associated with the JFK assassination.

This broad definition, coupled with the Review Board's powers

to request additional information from Executive agencies, and

the fact that the Board makes

the determination of what is

assassination material, could lead to a new investigation of

the assassination, rather than review of existing files for

to sette arous that.

Such an inquiry could well stray

into sensitive areas that are unrelated to the assassination.

The question of proper scope of the Review Board's charter

s a difficult one, and we do not mean to, sugges

easonable reouests for materials shouldndenied simolv becaus

they were not made by a previous Presidential Commission or

Congressional Committee.

However, there should be a provision

whereby Board

requests for additional materials that an

believes are unrelated to the assassination could be

agency

appealed--perhaps to the President.

The resolutions contain no provision requiring security

clearances of secure document handling by the Assassination

Materials Review Board or its Executive Director/staff

elements.

Absent security procedures and facilities that met

Frecutive branch

standards, agencies would be unable to provide

classified

assassination materials to the new body or its staff.

The resolutions provide a 30 day period for appealing

decisions by the Executive Director to release information.

This may not provide sufficient time for meaningful review

what could prove to be large volumes of material at one

time--particularly where some documents may require

coordination with other agencies.

We suggest that the

2

---

## Page 107

14-00000

Letter to MI. Bernard H. Martin

resolutions be amended to provide that agencies may file for an

automatic 30 day extension to consider whether an appeal is

necessary

before material is publicly disclosed.

We believe that the Executive Director of the Review Board

• should

have substantive expertise with respect to protection of

intelligence or law enforcement information readily available

so that the initial decisions on whether to release documents

are made on an informed basis.

Under the resolutions, neither

Board members nor the Executive Director may be government

employees or have any background in the assassination.

investigations.

Because of this

restriction, these individuals

are unlikely to have any familiarity with the documents at

issue and may well have no expertise in intelligence or law

enforcement equities.

While the Executive Director may request

detailees from Executive agencies and may consult with

originating agencies, there is no requirement that he do so.

An Executive branch agency with knowledge of the information at

stake and potential harms (or lack thereof) likely to result

from release of the information may have no involvement in the

process until after an initial determination has been made to

disclose the information.

Requiring that the staff informally

consult with agencies originating the information or mandating

detailees from the affected agencies (within reasonable

limits--particularly if details are to be nonreimbursable)

would ensure that relevant expertise is brought to bear as part

of the initial decision-making process.

The Board's broad powers to subpoena witnesses and

documents and hold hearings under the resolutions could

conflict with the DCI's statutory duty to protect sensitive

intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.

We believe the Board should be required to consult with the DCI

on issues like whether a hearing should be closed, or whether a

subpoena could be narrowed, if intelligence equities are

involved. Disagreements could be appealed to the President.

Section 6 of the resolutions, which outlines the grounds

for postponement of public release of a document, may not be

adequate to protect Agency interests in certain respects. For

example there is no provision for postponing release of

Executive privilege/deliberative

process, attorney-client, or

attorney work-product information.

privileges could

always be waived in the public interest,

but as the resolutions

are currently drafted, they would be wholly unavailable.

3

---

## Page 108

14-00000

Letter to Mi. Bernard H. Martin

While such privileges are not likely to arise with respect to

factual information directly related to the JFK assassination,

they could well arise with respect to other documents swept up

in the resolutions' broad definition of assassination

materials.

We also believe that "intelligence agent" under

section 6(1) (A) of the resolutions should be defined with

reference

to the Intelligence Identities Protection Act so as

to protect the identity of covert employees of the Agency.

The Congressional oversight mechanism established for Board

activities also may conflict with the existing rules for

oversight of intelligence activities.

The resolutions provide

for congressional oversight of the Review Board and its

activities by the "appropriate" House committee and the SSCI,

although we have reason to believe that the resolutions may be

we remove ene sch

amended to remove the SSCI from oversight responsibilities.

Under the resolutions, the committees would obtain copies of

all material that were not released. Thus, the resolutions are

likely to involve non-intelligence oversight committees in the

review of sensitive CIA information that would not be released

to the public.

Congress enacted the Intelligence Oversight Act

of 1980 in part to reduce the number of congressional

committees with access to sensitive CIA information.

Expanding

the number of committees with access to our information would

be of concern, especially if the Review Board seeks new

documents minimally-related to the assassination.

Finally, each resolution specifically provides that it does

not

affect FOIA actions.

We would suggest that the resolution

explicitly stay responses to FOIA requests related to

assassination materials while the Review Board is conducting

its business.

The resolutions clearly have a more liberal

standards for public disclosure of information than does the

FOIA, and

the public is likely to get assassination materials

more expeditiously if agencies are permitted to focus their

resources on supporting the work of the Review Board.

We

appreciate the opportunity to comment on the

assassination materials resolutions.

Please contact

Vicki Pepper of my staff

at (703) 482-6126 with

questions or comments

any

concerning the Agency's position

on these resolutions.

Sincerely,

Stanley M. Moskowitz

DCI TESTIMONY AT JEK ASSASSINATION HEARING

The DCI testified yesterday at a Senate Governmental

Affairs Committee hearing on the Assassination Materials

Disclosure Act of 1992.

This is a joint resolution sponsored

by Senator David Boren and aimed at providing a comprehensive

process ultimately leading to the release of all materials

held by the United States Government regarding the

assassination of President John F. Kennedy •

The DCI will

essentially repeat this testimony on 15 May for a similar

joint resolution sponsored in the House of Representatives

by Congressman Louis Stokes.

Perhaps no public event

in our lifetime has had the

impact of the murder of President Kennedy. We have all heard

reckless

accusations against the Agency in connection with

that terrible event, and we all have an interest in an

accurate history of it.

For that reason we are circulating

the full text of the DCI's testimony.

At the end of the attached text, you will also find a

reply by the DCI during the ensuing question-and answer

period when Senator William Cohen asked about the jeopardy

that might be caused by revealing the identity of

a source

so long after

the fact or even if the source were deceased.

STATEMENT OF

ROBERT M. GATES

DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON

GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS

UNITED STATES SENATE

12 May 1992

---

## Page 111

Mr. Chairman, I am here today at your request to provide my views on

Senate Joint Resolution 282, "The Assassination Materials Disclosure Act of

1992," and to describe the nature of documents held by the CIA that relate to the

assassination of John F. Kennedy. I very much appreciate the opportunity to

speak on this important matter.

Let me begin by stating that I am in complete agreement with the purpose

underlying the joint resolution— that efforts should be made to declassify and

make available to the public as quickly as possible government documents

relating to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. We hope that opening up and

giving journalists, historians and, most importantly, the public access to

governmental files will help to resolve questions that still linger over 28 years

after the assassination. Further, I believe that maximum disclosure will discredit

the theory that CIA had anything to do with the murder of John F. Kennedy.

Even before introduction of this joint resolution, I recognized the need for

greater public access to CIA documents of historical importance. Two months

ago, I announced the establishment of a new unit within CIA that will be

responsible for declassifying as many historical documents as possible consistent

with the protection of intelligence sources and methods. This new unit, the

Historical Review Group, in the Agency's Center for the Study of Intelligence,

will review for declassification documents 30 years old or older, and national

intelligence estimates on the former Soviet Union that are 10 years old or older.

In addition to the systematic review of 30-year-old documents, I have directed

the History Staff in the Center for the Study of Intelligence to assemble CIA

records focusing on particular events of historical importance, including the

assassination of President Kennedy. The Historical Review Group will then

examine the documents for the purpose of declassifying the records.

Because of high interest in the JFK papers, I am not waiting for legislation

or other agencies to start declassifying documents belonging to CIA. The

Historical Review Group, at my direction, already has begun its review of the

documents related to the assassination of President Kennedy, and I am glad to

report that the first group of these records, including all CIA documents on Lee

Harvey Oswald prior to the assassination, has been declassified with quite

minimal deletions and is being transferred to the National Archives for release to

the public. This is, I acknowledge, a small fraction of what we have, but it is an

earnest of my commitment to begin review for declassification immediately of

this material. And, indeed, as I speak, the reviewers are going through a

substantial number of documents, and I anticipate that many of these will be

released shortly.

As we carry out our program to declassify Kennedy assassination documents,

our goal will be to release as many documents as possible. In fact, I recently

approved new CIA declassification guidelines for our Historical Review Program

which specifically direct a presumption in favor of declassification. I believe we

can be very forward leaning in making these documents available to the public,

and I have instructed the Historical Review Group to take this attitude to heart.

To understand the magnitude of the effort involved in reviewing these

documents for declassification, it is important to place them in some context. The

CIA's collection of documents related to the assassination of President Kennedy

consists of approximately 250,000-300,000 pages of material. This includes 64

boxes of copies and originals of information provided to the Warren Commission

and the House Select Committee on Assassinations and 17 boxes of material on

Lee Harvey Oswald accumulated after President Kennedy's assassination.

Unfortunately, and for reasons I do not know, what we are dealing with is a mass

of material that is not indexed, is uncatalogued, and is highly disorganized-all

of which makes the review process more difficult. The material contains

everything from the most sensitive intelligence sources to the most mundane

news clippings.

These records include documents that CIA had in its files before the

assassination, a large number of records that CIA received later as routine

disseminations from other agencies, as well as the reports, correspondence, and

other papers that CIA prepared in the course of the assassination investigations. I

should emphasize that these records were assembled into the present collection as

a result of specific inquiries received from the Warren Commission or the House

Select Committee on Assassinations. I have prepared a chart that illustrates this

point.

As you can see, prior to President Kennedy's assassination CIA held only a

small file on Lee Harvey Oswald that consisted of 33 documents (approximately

110 pages), some of which originated with the FBI, State Department, the Navy,

and newspaper clippings. Only 11 documents originated with the CIA. I have

brought along a copy of Oswald's file as it existed before the assassination so

that you can see first-hand how slender it was at the time. As I have already

noted, we have declassified the CIA documents in this file with quite minimal

deletions, and we are providing them to the National Archives. The records in

this file dealt with Oswald's defection to the Soviet Union in 1959 and his

activities after his return in 1962. By contrast, it was only after the assassination

that CIA accumulated the rest of the material on Oswald-some 33,000 pages-

most of which CIA received from other agencies after November 22, 1963.

2

---

## Page 113

You have asked about documents in our possession generated by other

agencies. In fact, much of the material held by CIA originated with other

agencies or departments. For example, in the 17 boxes of Oswald records,

approximately 40% of the documents originated with the FBI, and about 20%

originated from the State Department or elsewhere. Our staff is still going

through the material compiled at the request of the Warren Commission and the

House Select Committee on Assassinations, which includes 63 boxes of paper

records and one box that contains 73 reels of microfilm. The microfilms in part

overlap material in other parts of the collection. We estimate that within the 63

boxes of paper records, approximately 27% of the documents originated with a

variety of other U.S. government agencies, private organizations, and foreign and

American press.

Although our holdings do include many documents from other agencies, we

nonetheless have a substantial collection of CIA documents that will require a

considerable effort to review and, as I said earlier, at my direction, this review

for declassification is now underway. A preliminary survey of these files has

provided us some indications of what they contain. Although the records cover a

wide variety of topics, they principally focus on CIA activities concerning Cuba

and Castro, Oswald's defection to the Soviet Union, and Oswald's subsequent

activities in Mexico City and New Orleans. They also include a large number of

name traces requested by the staff of the House Select Committee on

Assassinations, as well as material relating to the Garrison investigation and

Cuban exile activities.

The CIA cannot release a number of documents unilaterally because of the

limits in the Privacy Act (which protects the names of American citizens against

unauthorized disclosure), the sequestration of many documents by the House

Select Committee on Assassinations, and the fact that many of the documents

belong to agencies other than the CIA. However, we have already taken the

necessary steps to lift the sequestration, coordinate with other agencies and begin

the process of declassification. If necessary, I will ask the House for a resolution

permitting CIA to release the results of the declassification effort on the

sequestered documents.

While I expect a large amount of material can be declassified under our

program, I assume that there still will be information that cannot be released to

the public for a variety of reasons, including privacy concerns or the exposure of

intelligence sources and methods. Let me take a moment to give examples of this

type of material. During the investigation by the House Select Committee on

Assassinations, I understand that security and personnel files were requested on a

number of Agency employees. These files contain fitness reports (performance

evaluations), medical evaluations and credit checks on individual CIA officers.

3

## Page 114

Although irrelevant to the question of who killed President Kennedy, these and

other personal documents ultimately ended up in the sequestered collection of

documents. I do not believe that the benefit to the public of disclosure of this

information outweighs the clear privacy interest of the individuals in keeping this

information confidential. Similar privacy concerns exist with documents

containing derogatory information on particular individuals where the

information is based on gossip or rumor. Our files also contain names of

individuals who provided us intelligence information on a promise of

confidentiality. We would not disclose their names in breach of such a promise.

Where we cannot disclose such information to the public, the Agency will make

redactions and summarize the information in order to ensure that the maximum

amount of information is released while still protecting the identity of an agent or

the privacy of an individual.

If legislation is not passed by Congress and signed by the President

regarding the JFK papers, to enhance public confidence and provide reassurance

that CIA has not held back any information relevant to the assassination, I will

appoint a panel of distinguished Americans from outside of government to

examine whatever documents we have redacted or kept classified. They would

then issue an unclassified public report on their findings.

The effort required to declassify the documents related to the assassination of

President Kennedy will be daunting. However, it is an important program, and l

am personally committed to making it work. Even in this time of diminishing

resources within the Intelligence Community, I have directed the allocation of 15

full-time positions to expand the History Staff and to form the Historical Review

Group that will review the JFK documents and other documents of historical

interest.

I believe these actions attest to the seriousness of our intent to get these

papers declassified and released, and to open what remains classified to outside,

non-governmental review. It is against this background that, in response to this

Committee's request, I cite our technical reservations about the mechanism

established by the joint resolution to achieve this same result. I intend to address

only Intelligence Community concerns; I will defer to the Department of Justice

on any additional problems posed by the joint resolution.

First, vesting in an outside body the determination as to whether CIA

materials related to the assassination can be released to the public is inconsistent

with my statutory responsibility to protect intelligence sources and methods.

Second, I am concerned that the joint resolution contains no provision

requiring security clearances or secure document handling by the Assassination

Materials Review Board or its staff.

4

---

## Page 115

Third, I am concerned that the joint resolution does not provide the Agency

with the opportunity to object to the release of CIA information contained in

documents originated by Congress or the Warren Commission. Under the joint

resolution, documents originated by these entities can be released directly by the

Executive Director of the Assassination Materials Review Board without any

review by the President or other Executive Branch agencies.

Fourth, the joint resolution provision for a 30-day period for agencies or

departments to appeal decisions by the Executive Director to release information

may not provide sufficient time for meaningful review of what could prove to be

a large volume of material at one time.

Fifth and finally, section 6 of the joint resolution, which outlines the grounds

for postponement of public release of a document, makes no provision for

postponing release of documents that may contain Executive privilege or

deliberative process, attorney-client, or attorney work-product information. While

such privileges could be waived in the public interest and are not likely to arise

with respect to factual information directly related to the JFK assassination, they

would be unavailable under the joint resolution in the rare case that they might

be needed

These are technical problems that I believe can be solved in ways that will,

in fact, expedite the release of documents bearing on the assassination of

President Kennedy.

But, again, whatever the future course of the legislation, CIA is proceeding

even now to review for declassification the relevant documents under its control.

Further, we will cooperate with any mechanism established by the Congress and

the President to declassify all of this material.

## Page 116

Mr. Chairman, let me close with a comment on why I am personally

committed to get these documents out. Like all Americans old enough to recall

that terrible day in November 1963, as several members of the committee have

alluded to, I also remember where I was and what I was doing. I was a college

student at William and Mary. I can remember how the word spread like wildfire

between classes of that horrible event. I made my way to Washington that

weekend and stood at the intersection of Constitution and Pennsylvania Avenues

where I waited for hours to watch the president's funeral cortege. I will never

forget it.

I entered public service less than three years later, heeding President

Kennedy's inaugural call, a call I think many in my generation heard. He said

then: Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though

arms we need, not as a call to battle, though in battle we are, but as a call to bear

the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, rejoicing in hope,

patient in tribulation, a struggle against the common enemies of man-tyranny,

poverty, disease, and war itself.

Mr. Chairman, the only thing more horrifying to me than the assassination

itself is the insidious perverse notion that elements of the American government,

that my own agency, had some part in it. I am determined personally to make

public or to expose to disinterested eyes every relevant scrap of paper in CIA's

possession in the hope of helping to dispel this corrosive suspicion. With or

without legislation, I intend to proceed. I believe I owe that to his memory.

Thank you.

SENATOR COHEN: Okay. I'm going to give you a chance in a moment,

Judge Sessions. I just want to move on quickly, because we have Mr. James-I

think, Lazar-who's going to be testifying shortly and I will not be here for that

either. But he questions the issue of intelligence sources, that the bill provides

that disclosure can be postponed if the release of that information would reveal

an intelligence asset. And Mr. Lazar suggests that number one, that should apply

only if that particular agent is living; and then secondly, even if living, that the

burden would be upon the agency to present by clear and convincing evidence,

that disclosures of the identity of that particular agent would in fact present a

danger to him or to his family, I assume, or serious damage could result from the

disclosure of his identity.

Could you, number one, give us some instance in which disclosure of a

deceased intelligence agent or asset would be contrary to our national security

interests? And then secondly, address the issue of clear and convincing evidence

that the agent being alive, that he might be jeopardized by that disclosure?

6

---

## Page 117

GATES: At the root of effective intelligence work is our ability to deal with

people who are willing to provide us with information and to assure them of

confidentiality and that their identity will be protected. The Congress has

recognized that. The Congress has even recognized the importance of protecting

the covert identities of American case officers dealing with such foreign agents.

I believe that we have an obligation to protect the confidentiality of our

sources, regardless of the amount of time that has passed. And I believe that if

the agent is deceased, that we also have to take into account the potential

considerations for that agent's family. There are many countries in the world

today, in which despite whatever political changes have taken place, families of

those who have defected or who have proven to be agents or who are revealed to

have been agents are persecuted or mal-treated or where their life becomes much

more difficult, and I think we have an obligation to these people.

I think you—I think we are not in a position of saying "never." But I think

that any decision with respect to revealing the identity of a source or an agent,

even 20 or 30 years after the information was reported is one that has to be taken

with enormous care and deliberation, one that must involve knowledge of the

particular circumstances involved, both at the time the information was received

and the circumstances of the agent and his family.

In short, so important is the ability to protect the confidentiality of sources

that a decision to reveal that identity would have to be the result of the most

careful consideration.

Office of Congressional Affairs

SUBJECT:

Congress Passes JFK Bill

Congress on 30 September passed the Senate version of

Kennedy Assassination Records

Collection Act of 1992, calling for the public disclosure of

government documents related to the assassination of

President Kennedy. The key features of the bill are as

follows:

• The bill requires government agencies, including CIA,

to transmit their respective JFK assassination records

to the National Archives for public disclosure within

300 days of enactment of the bill unless the records

qualify for "postponement." Government offices that

hold JFK assassination records created by another

office should transmit those records to the originating

office rather than to the Archives.

(a) an intelligence agent whose identity currently

requires protection;

(b) an intelligence source or method which is

currently utilized or reasonably expected to be

utilized by the USG;" or

(c) a confidential USG source who would face a

substantial risk of harm if exposed.

In many cases, postponement is justified only if the

potential harm to national security also outweighs the

public interest in disclosure.

CIA HAS NO OBJECTION TO

DECLASSIFICATICA AND/OR

RELEASE OF CIA INFORMATION

IN THIS DOCUMENT

For Immediate Release

October 27, 1992

STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT

Today I am signing into law S. 3006, the "President John F.

Kennedy Assassination Records Collection

Act of 1992."

legislation provides for the review and, wherever possible, the

release of records about the assassination of President Kennedy

that have not yet been made public. I fully support the goals

of this legislation.

In the minds of many Americans, questions about President

Kennedy's assassination remain unresolved.

Although the

Government already has released many thousands of documents,

the existence of additional, undisclosed documents has led to

speculation that these materials might shed important new light

on the assassination.

Because of legitimate historical interest

in this tragic event, all documents about the assassination

should now be disclosed, except where the strongest possible

reasons counsel otherwise.

While I am pleased that this legislation avoids the

chief constitutional problems raised by earlier versions of

the bill considered by the Congress, it still raises several

constitutional questions.

First, S. 3006 sets forth the

grounds on which the release of documents may be postponed,

but this list does not contemplate nondisclosure of executive

branch deliberations or law enforcement information of the

executive branch (including the entities

sections 3(2) (G) through (K))

and it provides only a narrow

oasis for nondisclosure of national security information.

authority to protect these categories of information comes

the Constitution and cannot be limited by

Although only the most extraordinary circumstances would

require postponement of the disclosure of documents for reasons

other than those recognized in the bill,. I cannot abdicate my

constitutional responsibility to take such

applies to the provision purporting to

give certain congressional

committees "access to

held or created by the Review Board."

This provision will

be interpreted consistently with my authority under the

Constitution to protect confidential executive branch materials

and to supervise and guide executive branch officials.

Second, S. 3006 requires the Board to report to the

President and the Congress.

If. the bill were

interpreted to

require simultaneous reports, S. 3006 would intrude upon the

President's authority to supervise subordinate officials in the

executive branch.

I will construe the provisions to require

that the Board report to the President before it reports to the

Congress.

Third, the bill purports to set the qualifications

for Board members,

to require the President to review lists

supplied by specified organizations, and to direct the timing

of nominations.

These provisions conflict with the constitu

tional division of responsibility between the President and the

Congress.

The President has the sole power of nomination; the

Senate has the sole power of consent:

Introduction

This memorandum analyzes the principal duties, responsibilities, and procedures of the

Assassination Records Review Board (Review Board) and other government offices

under the President John F. Kennedy Records Collection Act of 1992 (the "JFK Act" or

"the Statute"). Because the JFK Act establishes the duties and powers of the

Assassination Records Review Board, it is important to understand the scope of the

Statute's provisions and anticipate its potential pitfalls. This memorandum - which is

based principally on an analysis of the JFK Act and its Senate Report' - identifies: (a)

thest repoing aliga gone wing the erie for the doted oldin under the FK

Act; (c) the statutory procedures governing the review process? and (d) the

responsibilities of other governmental entities to further the goals of the Statute.'

Part I: Statutory Duties of the Assassination Records Review Board

The JFK Act does not systematically set forth the duties of the Review Board. Rather,

the description of the Board's duties are interspersed among several different statutory

'S. Rep. No. 102-328, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. (1992) ("Senate Report"), reprinted in

part, in 1992 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2965. The Senate Report provides, inter alia, a section-by-

section analysis of the final Senate version of the JFK Act.

¿This memorandum does not address the substantive guidelines pertaining to -

postponements that are addressed in Section 6.

3This memorandum is designed to identify comprehensively the issues that are

of immediate importance and concern to the Board. Accordingly, some important

statutory provisions that are not of immediate concern are not discussed. For example,

there is no discussion of the qualifications or appointment of Board members (Sec. 7(b)),

removal of Board members (Sec. 7(g)), definitions (unless they pertain to the review

process or the powers of the Board) (Sec. 3), or provisions pertaining to the hiring of

staff (Sec. 8(b)).

provisions." With the exception of the Board's procedural duties related to the review

process, which will be described in Part Ill below, the remaining duties (including

reporting obligations) of the Board are as follows:

First, the Board should publish a schedule for review of records in the Federal Register.

"The Review Board shall ... not later than 90 days after the date of its appointment,

publish a schedule for review of all assassination records in the Federal Register." Sec.

9(b)(1). The Statute does not disclose the meaning of "schedule" — that is whether it is a

list or a time-frame. Assuming an enactment date of October 6, 1994,5 a "schedule"

should have been published by January 2, 1995. Although the Review Board does not

have sufficient information to draft or to describe with particularity such a schedule, it

would be advisable to prepare promptly a general schedule so that the Board will come

into compliance as soon as possible with this provision of the Statute:

"The sections of the JFK Act may be described as follows:

Severability Clause

Several of the Board's reporting obligations are triggered by the date of

enactment of the Statute. In addition to the requirement to publish a schedule raised

above, another such example is that the Board's first annual "report shall be issued on

the date that is 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act..." Sec. 9(f)(2).

Technically, the date of enactment was October 26, 1992, although this memorandum

will assume that the "date of enactment" for the Board's purposes - although not for

the purposes of the obligations of other government offices - was October 6, 1994, the

date the technical amendments were enacted. Pub.L. 103-345 §§ 2 to 5, 108 Stat. 3128-

3130.

Second, the Board should have begun its review of records by the first week of April,

1995. "The Review Board shall ... not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of

this Act, begin its review of assassination records under this Act." Sec. 9(b)(2).

lechnically, the Board has begun its review — although it has as of yet made no final

decisions. In order to comply with the "spirit" of the Statute, the Board should begin

making decisions promptly.

Third, the Board must submit four ongoing reports regarding the results of its decisions

to postpone or to release information. The Board has four separate reporting

requirements for describing the ongoing results of its decisions. First, the Board is

required to report the results of its decisions on a document-by-document basis to the

government office whose records it is reviewing as well as to the President (or to

Congress in the case of legislative records). Second, the results of decisions must be

reported in the Federal Register within 14 days of the date of the decision. Third, the

Board must make a monthly summary report in the Federal Register. Fourth, the Board

must prepare a document-by-document report to be submitted to NARA that describes

the decision-making process for each record. Sec. 9(c)(3).

Fourth, the Board must produce an Annual Report to Congress. The Board must submit

an Annual Report to Congress on the anniversary of the enactment of the legislation.

Thus the Board's first Annual Report is due on or before October 6, 1995. The Annual

Report must include information on the following topics: (a) finances; (b) progress

made on review; (c) estimates for completion of the review; (d) any special problems

(including the degree of cooperation of government agencies); (e) a record of the

volume of records reviewed and a summary of decisions; (f) an explanation of any

additional needs of the Review Board; and (g) an appendix containing copies of reports

of postponed records. Sec. 9(f)(3).

Fifth, the Board must produce a Final Report. "Upon its termination, the Review Board

shall submit reports to the President and the Congress including a complete and

accurate accounting of expenditures during its existence, and shall complete all other

reporting requirements under this Act." Sec. 7(0)(2).

Sixth, the Board must inform the President and Congress in advance of the termination

of its activities. The Review Board must give Congress 90 days notice of the anticipated

termination date for its operations. Sec. 9(+)(4).

Seventh, the Board must transfer its own records to NARA. "[A]ll Review Board

records" are to be transferred to NARA. Sec. 4 (a)(2)(C). See also 7(1) and 7(0)(3). The

Statute is silent on the question whether the Review Board must prepare Record

Identification Forms (or Identification Aids) for its own records prior to their

---

'".

submission to NARA.

Eighth, the Review Board is under the Oversight Jurisdiction of the Appropriate Senate

and House Committees. The Review Board operates under the continuing oversight

jurisdiction of House and Senate committees. Sec. 7(1).

Part II: Statutory Powers of the Review Board.

The powers granted to the Review Board are not listed in any single section of the

Statute, but are instead interspersed throughout. The Review Board's powers will first

be enumerated below, followed by a more detailed discussion of the four most

significant powers: the subpoena power; the power to grant immunity; powers to order

federal agencies to comply with the Statute; and the power to require the transfer of

records to the Review Board.

Enumeration of powers. The JFK Act grants the Review Board the authority to:

(1)

"direct Government offices to complete identification aids and organize

assassination records" Sec. 7(j)(1)(A).

(2)

(3)

(4)

"direct Government offices to transmit to the Archivist assassination

records" Sec. 7(j)(1)(B); see also Sec. 9(1).

"direct Government offices" to provide " substitutes and summaries of

[postponed] assassination records" Sec. 7(i)(1)(B) (emphasis added).

"obtain access to assassination records that have been identified and

organized by a Government office" Sec. 7(j)(1(C)(i).

(5)

"direct a Government office to ... make available additional information,

records, or testimony from individuals" and, "if necessaryl] investigate

the facts surrounding additional information, records, or testimony from

individuals" provided that the "Review Board has reason to believe" that

obtaining such additional information "is required to fulfill its functions

and responsibilities under this Act." Sec. 7(j) (1)(C)(ii).

"The Board is given some additional authority that is not important for present

purposes, such as the power to "receive information from the public," "use the Federal

Supply Service" and "use the United States mails..." Sec. 7()(E), (G), and (H). The

Review Board also may use the services of GSA. Sec. 7(m).

"request the Attorney General to subpoena private persons to compel

testimony, records, and other information" Sec. 7(j)(1)(C)(iii) (see

discussion below).

"require any Government office to account in writing for the destruction

of any records relating to the assassination" Sec. 7()(1)(D).

"hold hearings, administer oaths, and subpoena witnesses and

documents." Sec. 7(j)(1)(F) (see discussion below)..

extend its tenure by one additional year from September 30, 1996 to

September 30, 1997. Sec. 7(0)(1).

create advisory committees Sec. 8(d)(1).

require Government offices to transfer assassination records to the Review

Board. Sec. 5(b); Sec. 5(c)(2)(E); Sec. 9(a) (see discussion below).

"request the Attorney General to petition any court in the United States or

abroad to release any information relevant to the assassination..." Sec.

10(a)(1) (see discussion in Part IV below).

"request the Attorney General to petition any court in the United States to

release any information relevant to the assassination... that is held under

the injunction of secrecy of a grand jury." Sec. 10(b)(1).* (see discussion in

Part IV below).

Subpoena power. The JFK Act is ambiguous with respect to the Review Board's

subpoena powers. The Statute refers to the subpoena power in two provisions. The

Statute first states that the Review Board has the authority to "request the Attorney

General to subpoena private persons to compel testimony, records, and other

information" Sec. 7(j)(1)(C)(iii) (emphasis added). This provision may be read in one of

'Items (1) through (9) are also identified in the Senate Report 42-43.

"Such requests are deemed to constitute "a particularized need" under Rule 6 of

the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Sec. 10(a)(2)(B).

---

## Page 154

= 9 -

two different ways. It could be read to give the Board authority only to request the

assistance of the Attorney General, but not to have the authority to issue subpoenas on

its own behalf. The second way of reading the provision is that the Board has the

power to issue subpoenas on its own authority and that it may request the Attorney

General to provide assistance to the Board in issuing such subpoenas.

The second provision of the Statute that addresses the subpoena power provides that

the Board may "hold hearings, administer oaths, and subpoena witnesses and

documents." Sec. 7(j)(1)(F) (emphasis added). This second provision is also ambiguous.

There are at least three different ways that it could be read. First, it could be read in

tandem with the earlier provision, meaning that the Board may issue subpoenas only

with the Attorney General's authorization. Second, it could mean that the Board may

• issue subpoenas on its own authority, but only as ancillary to holding hearings. Finally,

the provision could be a simple and direct grant of authority to the Review Board to

issue subpoenas.

Although the Statute on its face does not clearly require or exclude any of these

interpretations, the Senate Report provides useful guidance in its statement that the

Review Board has the full power to issue subpoenas on its own authority and that the

role of the Attorney General is simply to provide additional assistance to the Board.

The Senate Réport interprets the JFK Act as providing that: "[The Review Board.

has the authority to subpoena private persons and to enforce the subpoenas through

the courts.'""

Because the Senate Report speaks clearly, and because it can be read consistently with

the Statute,

1º the Review Board may reasonably conclude that it may issue subpoenas

on its own authority and that the role of the Attorney General is to provide assistance to •

the Board." However, because there is a degree of ambiguity in the Statute, it would be

prudent for the Board to reach an understanding with the Attorney General prior to the

issuance of its first subpoena.

"Senate Report 19 (emphasis added).

Under federal law, an agency is entitled to "substantial deference" when

interpreting its own enabling legislation, provided that its interpretation is

"reasonable."

"Moreover, it should perhaps be noted that the grant of the subpoena power to

an agency, such as the Board, implies that the power may be extended to the staff when

acting in accordance with the Board's authority. See Administrative Procedure Act, 5

U.S.C. 556(c).

Immunity power. The Board is granted the power to immunize witnesses from criminal

prosecution. Sec. 7(k). This is an important power that can be very useful in eliciting

testimony from reluctant witnesses. Because granting of immunity may affect the

prosecutorial function, it would be advisable to consult in advance with the Attorney

General regarding the manner and procedures for immunizing witnesses.

Power to order federal offices to comply with the JFK Act. The Board is given the

authority to order government offices within the executive and legislative branches to

comply with the terms of the JFK Act. Thus the Board may "direct a Government.

office to ... make availabte additional information, records, or testimony from

individuals" and, "if necessaryl,] investigate the facts surrounding additional

information, records, or testimony from individuals" provided that the "Review Board

has reason to believe" that obtaining such additional information "is required to fulfill

its functions and responsibilities under this Act." Sec. 7(j)(1)(C)(ii).

The Senate Report speaks of this particular power as being "extremely important to the

proper implementation and effectiveness of the Act because it provides the Review

Board with the authority to seek the fullest disclosure possible by going beyond the

information and records which government offices initially chose to make available to

the public and the Review Board."13 The Report further presumes that all government

offices should "comply expeditiously to satisfy the Review Board's request and need for

access.

"14 The Senate Report summarizes this by stating that: "the Review Board has

the authority to direct any government office to produce additional information and

records which it believes are related to the assassination. "15

Although the Board is granted the power to order government offices to comply, there

remains the question of what measures are available to the Board in order to enforce

compliance. The Statute does not, however, answer this question. Under general

provisions of federal law, one agency does not have the power to seek judicial relief

against another agency unless it is specifically granted power to do so in its enabling

"The Statute defines "government office" as "any office of the Federal

Government that has possession or control of assassination records" (Sec. 5), which

would seem to extend to the judiciary as well. However, the specific examples listed in

Section 5 are all from the executive and legislative branches.

Power to require government offices to transfer records to the Review Board.

Government agencies are to maintain custody of their own records during the review

process unless "the Review Board requires the physical transfer of records for purposes

of conducting an independent and impartial review" or "transfer is necessary for an

administrative hearing or other Review Board function...." Sec. 5(b). See also

5(c)(2)(E); Sec. 9(a). Agencies also are instructed to make records available for the

Review Board's inspection. Sec. 5(b) and 5(c)(2)(E-F); 5(c)(2)(H) - including any records

about which there is any uncertainty as to whether they are assassination records. Sec.

5(c)(2)(F). Agencies also must "[make available to the Review Board any additional

information and records that the Review Board has reason to believe it requires for

conducting a review under this Act." Sec. 5(c)(2)(H).

Part III: Statutory Guidance on Review Procedures and Transfer of Records to

NARA.

The JFK Act establishes general guidelines for the procedures to be followed in

reviewing records. The basic procedures are relatively straightforward: government

offices that possess assassination records are to locate and review the records to

determine what can be released and what should be postponed. The postponed records

are then to be made available to the Review Board for its independent assessment. But

there are many questions left unanswered. For example, agencies are allowed to

present "clear and convincing evidence" in order to sustain their postponements, but no

*The President could, of course, solve the political aspects of an inter-agency

dispute by ordering the relevant agency to comply with his directives.

(1989)).

mechanism is established for when and how such evidence should be presented. 18

The JFK Act provides two types of guidance relating to the review process. First, the

Statute provides substantive guidance relating to postponements. Second, the Statute

explains the basic procedural steps that follow from the Review Board's decisions. This

memorandum addresses only the procedural steps established by the Statute.19

A. Review Board Quorum and Voting Requirements.

The JFK Act does not directly address quorum or voting requirements for Board

meetings. The sole relevant guidance from the Act is its repeated statement that it

presumes disclosure, which suggests that a majority of the members of the Board would

need to vote for a postponement (rather than requiring a majority to vote for a release)

in order for the postponement to be sustained. "

I8Given the absence of clear statutory guidance on the question of when agencies

should be able to present their evidence, it would be appropriate for the Review Board

to consult with the government offices to determine efficient, fair, and reasonable

procedures to afford opportunities to present evidence. The Senate Report offers the

following guidance: "to the extent possible, consultation with the government offices

creates an understanding on each side as to the basis and reasons for their respective

recommendations and determinations." Senate Report 31.

*The substantive rules relating to postponement decisions will be addressed in a

separate memorandum.

2See, for example, "The underlying principles guiding the legislation are

independence, public confidence, efficiency and cost effectiveness, speed of records

disclosure, and enforceability. In order to achieve these objectives, the Act creates a

presumption of disclosure upon the government, and it establishes an expeditious.

process for the review and disclosure of the records." Senate Report 17.

The JFK Act is, however, silent on several procedural issues affecting internal Review

Board decisionmaking, including: (a) whether Board voting must be by a majority or

supermajority; (b) whether the statutory presumption of disclosure necessarily implies

that a majority (or supermajority) must vote against release rather than requiring a

majority (or supermajority) to favor release: (c) whether the statutory presumption

favoring disclosure implies that a "tie vote" requires release of information; (d) what

constitutes a quorum for the purpose of decisions on the release of information and for

other purposes; (e) whether the Board may delegate some or all of its postponement

---

## Page 158

- 13 -

The Administrative Procedures Act, which regulates agency rulemaking and establishes

federal agency notice and publication requirements, does not establish rules governing

agencies' internal rulemaking and voting requirements, although the Sunshine Act does

establish some limited voting requirements related to decisions on holding meetings."

Similarly, Executive Order 12,866 (Sept. 30, 1993), exempts from reporting requirements

those rules that " are limited to agency organization, management, or personnel

matters...."2 Accordingly, the significant legal restriction on the Board's internal

voting procedures, quorum requirements, and other internal operating procedures, is

that they be reasonable and rational.?3

It would be advisable for the Review Board to establish voting and quorum

requirements as soon as practicable. Although the law does not require the formal

establishment of voting and quorum requirements, it would probably be advisable for

the Board to establish such rules (subject to later revision or amendment) and to make

the rules and procedures available for public inspection in the Reading Room.

B. Statutory Constraints on Postponement Decisions.

The Statute provides that when postponements are sustained in whole or in part, the

Board must nevertheless disclose as much information as possible - including through

the use of substitute language. The Statute requires that whenever a record cannot be

decisions to subcommittees of the Board; (f) whether a roll-call is required; and (g)

whether the votes of the individual members must be recorded.

2'The relevant portion of the Administrative Procedure Act provides that the

reporting requirements that pertain to most federal rulemaking procedures do not

apply to an agency's "interpretive rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency

organization, procedure, or practice ....'

." 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). The Administrative

Procedures Act contains some quorum and voting requirements with respect to

noticing meetings. 5 U.S.C. 552b.

22Exec. Order No. 12,866.

23See, for example, Idaho v. ICC, 939 F.2d 784, 788 (9th Cir. 1991) ("In the absence

of Congress' explicit direction, the [Interstate Commerce] Commission is empowered to

prescribe regulations and procedures to carry out [its obligations under its enabling

Statute]. We need only satisfy ourselves that the Commission set forth a rational basis

for its notational vote counting policy.")

disclosed in its entirety, the Review Board shall attempt to "provide for the disclosure

ot segree le pate performed, in onstries rich origing body and onesent

with the standards for postponement under this Act...." Sec. 9(c)(2)(B). Although this

language provides that the substitutes shall be drafted in consultation with the

agencies, the Statute does not disclose when, how, or under what circumstances such

consultations should take place. The Senate Report nevertheless presumes that

because the Statute mandates broad disclosure, the need for such summaries will be

infrequent.

While it is intended that government officels] shall have the ability to

issue such substitutes or summaries in lieu of an actual record, this

practice should be limited to the rarest cases if ever, with the

understanding that the release of information other than official records

will perpetuate public distrust and undermine public confidence in the

government's responsibility to disclose the assassination records. 25

2*The Statute requires that:

all postponed assassination records determined to require continued

postponement shall require an unclassified written description of the

reason for such continued postponement. Such description shall be

provided to the Archivist and published in the Federal Register upon

determination.

Sec. 5(g)(2)(B). The Statute does not state which entity bears the responsibility for

drafting written explanations for continued postponements. Because the requirement is

placed in Section 5 of the JFK Act, it would appear that the obligation would belong to

the Government office that was in possession of the records in question. The specific.

provision in which the requirement appears, Subsection (g), is titled "Periodic review of

postponed assassination records.". Thus the location of the requirement within the

Statute, the title of the section, and the subtitle of subsection all point to the requirement

of drafting the written description for the reason for the postponement as adhering to

the Government office where the record originated. Although neither the language nor

the location of the subsection obligates the Review Board to undertake the

responsibility, it may, as a practical matter, be advisable for the Review Board to accept

the burden.

C. Review Board Reporting Requirements.

Once the Review Board has made its decision, it must report the results to the.

government office whose record has been reviewed, to the President (or Congress), to

NARA, and in the Federal Register. (See Part I above.) The Board must not only report

its decisions in a timely manner, but it must report specific types of information about

its decisions.

Timing of reports. After a decision is made to postpone or to release a document, "the

Review Board shall notify the head of the originating body of its determination and

publish a copy of the determination in the Federal Register within 14 days after the

determination is made." Sec. 9(c)(4)(A). At the same time (i.e., within 14 days), the

Review Board must give notice regarding its decisions to the President (for Executive

Branch records) or to the Congressional oversight committees (for Legislative Branch

records). Sec. 9(c)(4)(B). In addition, there must be ongoing monthly reports to the

Federal Register.

Content of the Reports to the President, Congress, and the originating office. The

Report to the President (or Congress) and to the originating office "shall contain a

written unclassified justification for public disclosure or postponement of disclosure,

including an explanation of the application of any standards contained in section 6."

Sec. 9(c)(4)(B).

Content of monthly reports in the Federal Register. There must be a "Notice to the

Public" of decisions once every 30 days in Federal Register. (Sec. 9(d)(3)). These notices

must include "a description of the subject, originating agency, length or other physical

description, and each ground for postponement that is relied upon." Sec. 9(e).

Content of the Report to NARA. For each postponed record, the Board must send a

Report to the Archivist containing the following information: (a) a description of

actions; and (b) a specified time or occurrence for the record to be opened. (Although

the Statute requires a form for NARA and for the Agencies, it appears that the forms.

could easily be consolidated so as to include the relevant information and prevent

unnecessary duplication.)

D. The Role of the President (Executive Branch Records).

The Statute provides no clear guidance with respect to the mechanics of Presidential

review of Board decisions. It is frequently assumed in discussions of the JFK Act that

the President's role is that of route of appeal for an agency that is displeased with a

.,.:

## Page 161

- 16 -

decision by the Board. This is not, however, what the Statute provides. According to

the Statute, the President possesses the full power and authority to make all decisions

for both postponement and disclosure of executive branch records. According to the

Statute, once the Board makes a

formal determination... the President shall have the sole and

nondelegable authority to require the disclosure or postponement of such

record or information under the standards set forth in section 6, and the

President shall provide the Review Board with an unclassified written

certification specifying the President's decision with 30 days... stating the

justification for the president's decision, including the applicable grounds

for postponement under section 6, accompanied by a copy of the

identification aid...

Sec. 9(d)(1) (emphasis added)." This language clearly suggests that it is not the Board

that makes decisions, subject to appeal by the President, but it is the President that

makes decisions after having been informed of the Board's "formal determination."

The Senate Report makes the same point: "the President has the sole and nondelegable

authority to require the disclosure or postponement of such record or information

26The provision acknowledging presidential authority over executive branch

records intentionally excluded the President from any responsibility over legislative

branch records. Senate Report 32. The Senate Report recognizes that there might be a

dispute between the President and the Congress with respect to identifying records as

executive or congressional:

For example, within the files of the House Select Committee on

Assassinations (HSCA) there are staff notes (that] rely in part oi

information obtained or developed by the CIA. Under the 'third agency

rule in the Act, the ClA could choose to recommend that the Review

Board postpone those portions which it identifies as originating at the

CIA. If the Review Board declined the recommendation and the President

sought to override the determination, the President would be limited to

postpone those sentences or words which were originated or developed

by the CIA. The remainder of the document would have to be publicly

disclosed.

Senate Report 32.

2 Postponement decisions made by the President continue to be subject to

periodic review and downgrading. Sec. 9(d)(2).

---

## Page 162

- 17 - .

under the standards set forth in section 6, and the President must provide the Review

Board with an unclassified written certification specifying his decision within 30 days

after the Review. "28

Although the Statute requires the President to be faithful to the requirements of section

6 of the Act when making his decisions, there is no procedural mechanism either to

ensure that the President fulfills this responsibility of that he complies within the

statutorily mandated 30 day period.

Given these constraints, it would seem advisable for the Review Board to begin

negotiations with the White House for the disposition of records once the Board has

made its "formal determination." It may be that the White House, which no doubt does

not want to be distracted from its other duties by confronting the task of a document-

by document review, will be willing adopt a procedure that effectively ratifies the

Board's decision within thirty days unless an agency makes a particularized appeal.

The Statute does not seem to require the President to make such an agreement, but it

would seem to be consistent with the Statute, to be time and effort efficient, and to

spare all parties needless confusion.

Once the Review Board is notified of the President's decision, it must memorialize that

decision on the record form that it forwards to NARA. Sec. 9(d)(3).

E. The Role of the Congress (Legislative Branch Records).

Unlike Executive Branch records, where the President retains final decisionmaking

authority, legislative records are not subject to further procedural review by Congress.

Although Congress must be notified of the Board's decisions, it does not have a role

comparable to that which the President retains for executive branch documents. The

Review Board's decisions are thus automatic, with one important exception: Congress

retains the power to pass a resolution in both houses to limit the Review Board's

actions. The Senate Report explains that "[flor congressional records, in the event that

the Congress disagrees with a determination by the Review Board, each House would

be required to adopt a resolution to change or create a rule governing the disposition of

its records at issue."? This suggests that Congress will remove itself from the

28Senate Report 46.

29 Senate Report 18. Elsewhere the Report explains this in somewhat different

terms: when documents contain both executive and legislative equities, the President

may protect only executive branch interests.

"The remainder of the document would

---

## Page 163

- 18-.

document-by-document review process, but could undercut the Review Board's

decisions if it becomes sufficiently disturbed by the Board's decisions.

F. Transfer of Records to NARA.

Once the executive and legislative branch records decisions are final, the Board is

required to transfer the original records and identification forms directly to NARA.

Sec. 4 (d)(2). The Senate Report clearly anticipates that all originals will be transferred

to the JFK Collection, regardless of whether there are continuing postponements. "The

Committee believes that such review should occur at a single facility. That will be most

effectively achieved by bringing the review committee to the documents and not vice

versa. ... [There is less likelihood of loss or destruction, and therefore ease of access at

a single central location. *30

The records at NARA will be subject to periodic and continuing review, even after the

Review Board ceases to operate. The periodic review will be conducted jointly by

NARA and the originating body. "All postponed or redacted records shall be reviewed

periodically by the originating agency and the Archivist consistent with the

recommendations of the Review Board under section 9(c)(3)(B)." Sec. 5(g)(1). For -

congressional records, the House and Senate committees "shall have continuing

oversight jurisdiction with respect to ... the disposition of postponed records after

termination of the Review Board." Sec. 7(1). The Act "shall continue in effect until such

time as the Archivist certifies to the President and the Congress that all assassination

records have been made available to the public in accordance with the Act." Sec. 12(b).:

Part IV: Statutory Responsibilities of Government Offices under the JFK Act

Obligations of all Government offices possessing assassination records. The Statute

required all government offices possessing assassination records to "review, identify

and organize each assassination record in its custody or possession for disclosure to the

public, review by the Review Board, and transmission to the Archivist." Sec. 5(c)(1).

This provision effectively ordered agencies to have completed the review process by

August, 1993. The Senate Report is even more explicit: "Government offices holding

assassination records are required to begin organizing and reviewing such records

have to be publicly disclosed." Senate Report 32.

30Senate Report 25.

upon enactment and have this work completed within ten months of enactment. *31

Specific Obligation of Presidential and Other Libraries to Comply with JFK Act.

The Statute instructs Presidential libraries to give priority to processing assassination

records. Sec. 5(c)(3). According to the Senate Report, the JFK Act "specifically requires

the directors of presidential libraries to expedite the review of all assassination records

and make them available to the Review Board as required by this Act. It is incumbent

on the presidential libraries to determine which of its records may qualify as

'assassination records', regardless of whether the records were conveyed to the

government by a deed or gift or donation..

General Obligations to Cooperate With the Review Board. In addition to their

statutory obligations to identify and review assassination records, it is the sense of

Congress that "all Executive agencies should cooperate in full with the Review Board to

seek the disclosure of all information relevant to the assassination of President John F.

Kennedy consistent with the public interest." Sec. 10(b)(3).

Specific Obligations of Justice and State to Cooperate With the Review Board. The

Department of Justice and the Department of State are given particularized

responsibilities to assist the Review Board. The Attorney General is to assist in issuing

subpoenas, obtaining court records, and obtaining Grand Jury testimony under seal.

Sec. 10(a)(1)-(2) and 10(b)(1). The Statute also provides that it is "the sense of Congress"

that the Secretary of State should assist the Review Board in obtaining records from

foreign governments. Sec. 10(b)(2).

NOTE FOR:

J. Barry Harrelson @ DA

FROM:

Robert J. Eatinger @ DCI

DATE:

06/14/95 06:14:47 PM

SUBJECT:

ARRB Questions

The JFK Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) has indicated that they wish to take possession of the original records from CIA in

order to conduct their review of the postponements sought by the Agency those records. Further, the ARRB has stated that the JFK Act

(44 USC 2107 note) gives them the responsibility for transferring records to the National Archives and Records Administration, not the

originating agency. You asked me to review the JFK Act and comment on these positions.

The JFK Act provides that the original records are to be held by the originating agency unless physical transfer is required to let the Board

do its job. The Act states at section 9(a):

Pending the outcome of the Review Board's review activity, a Government

office shall retain custody of assassination records for purposes of preservation,

security, and efficiency, unless-

(1) the Review Board requires the physical transfer of records for reasons of

conducting an independent and impartial review; or

(2) such transfer is necessary for an administrative hearing or other official

Review Board function.

You should see also Section 5(b) of the Act which reposes in the originating agencies the responsibility to retain assassination records

pending review activity by the ARRB.

I understand that the Board believes that the process of it coming to CIA to review the records may not be working well. It may then be

arguing that it cannot adequately perform its function of reviewing unless it has the records. Unfortunately, if the Agency disagrees for

security reasons, there is no arbiter set forth in the Act.

On the second issue, the JFK Act is clear. The Board does not transfer records to NARA. The powers of the Board are set forth in

section 7(i) of the Act. In that section, the Board has the power to "direct Government offices to transmit to the Archivist assassination

records as required under this Act..." Further, Section 9(c), which discusses determinations of the Board provides that "(1) The Review

Board shall direct that all assassination records be transmitted to the Archivist and disclosed to the public in the Collection in the absence

of clear and convincing evidence that... Section 5(e) of the JFK Act provides the actual responsibility to transfer records to NARA to the

originating agencies, not to the ARRB.

Section 7(i) sets forth the duties of the Review Board and it does not list the transfer of assassination records to NARA. Its duties are

only to render decisions whether records are assassination records under the Act, and whether information in an assassination record

qualifies for postponement under the Act.

Thus, if the ARRB is arguing that it must take custody of the original records in order to meet its duty to transfer those records to NARA

it is wrong. The statute clearly contemplates that the records remain with the originating agency in normal circumstances and only that

the ARRB can direct its transfer once it has ruled on postponements.

CIA SPECIAL COLLECTIONS

RELEASE IN FULL

2000

DRAFT

12 December, 1998

Memo for the Record

Subject: JFK Records Review Project and Lessons Learned

The CIA's JFK Collection is made up primarily of

records pulled together for the Warren Commission, House

Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) and the

Assassinations Records Review Board (ARRB).

It contains a

significant amount of duplication and non-JEK related

material.

The current index is flawed and contains gaps.

Release

standards were liberal; basically only source

identities and information, names of agents, employees under

cover, Agency locations and foreign liaison activities were

redacted. There is no evidence in the Collection to indicate

that the Warren Commission conclusions were wrong.

I. Background (1992-1995)

The setting up of

the Historical Review Program by DCI

Gates in early 1992 coincided with growing interest in

Congress to require federal agencies to declassify records

related to the assassination of President Kennedy. DCI Gates

decided to start declassification process before Congress

passed legislation:

testified before Congress on 12 May 1992 about CIA*s

new openness policy and announced the declassification

of the first folder of Oswald's 201 (also known as the

pre-assassination file).

*

six boxes of the Oswald's 201 were reviewed and

transferred to NARA by Oct. 1992.

*

it called for Presidential-appointed Assassination

Records Review Board composed of non-government

individuals;

established "a presumption of immediate disclosure"

for records relating to the assassination.

For first two years of its existence, the Historical

Review Program focused

primarily on the review

of JFK

assassination records:

---

## Page 174

14-00000

there were two major releases of Agency records (August

1993 and August 1994) of approximately 227, 000 pages;

joint HRG/DO teams reviewed additional assassination

related collections at National Archives (Warren

Commission), the SSCI (Church Committee and the Ford

Presidential Library (Rockefellow Commission) plus

numerous referrals from other federal agencies (FBI,

State, Army, etc.).

Due to delays

in the appointment of its members and the

time required to hire and clear a staff, the ARRB did not

actually begin reviewing documents until May 1995. It became

clear in immediately that the ARRB would require the release

of far more information than the Agency had released in the

1992-94 review. In mid-1995 HRG began a re-review of the

previously released sanitized documents:

approximately 80% of the 227, 000 pages release in

1993-94 contained deletions

resources were taken from other projects and added

to JFK project to meet Board's monthly deadlines.

II. The JFK Act and the ARRB

Mandated review and declassification projects can be

two-edged swords.

The JFK Act forced the Agency to review

records that should have been opened years ago.

The legal

requirement to presume release, backed up by an independent

review, resulted in the opening of documents that clearly

would not have been released under other programs. However,

the Act and the Review Board created by the Act imposed un-

realistic deadlines, inflexible standards and procedures

which created a major drain on all Agency review resources

and had an over-all negative effect on the Agency's release

program.

Unrealistic Deadlines:

The release dates set by the

Act did not take into account the start-up time and costs

(searches, inventorying and indexing) of a project of this

magnitude, nor the time it would then take for a page-by-

page review and sanitization of classified documents. For

example, initial indexing of the collection was done on a

crash basis using overtime employees and resulted in a

flawed database.

The revising, re-indexing and updating of

that database took several thousand man-hours and continues

today •

Mandated Procedures:

NARA's and ARRB's interpretation

of the law created a time-consuming, labor-intensive review

process that meant an inordinate amount of time was spent by

---

## Page 175

both the Agency and Board staff on issues which were

marginal to the story and to processing decisions by the

Board.

For example:

a.

Under the JFK Act every piece of paper in the

collection was considered a "unique" assassination record.

The result is a staggering amount of chaff and duplication.

For example, one cable was files and processed 58 times in

the collection.

b.

The ARRB required that all sanitized documents be

reviewed by the Board

and that each postponement (deletion)

be acted on individually. Even after the Board changed

procedures and accepted

staff recommendations instead of

reviewing each document, the detailed tracking, recording

and coding of every deletion within each document required

processing resources well beyond what would be considered

reasonable for such a project. A most sanitized documents

contained multiple deletions (one contained more than 1600

deletions and many over 100).

Inflexible Standards: The level of evidence required

by the Board to postpone what was generally considered

protectable information was extremely high and usually

required documentation of "current harm"

• Defenses based on

general principles

such as official cover or sources and

methods were not acceptable.

This required the Agency to

dedicate significant resources to prepare evidence to

support recommended

postponements.

Again, much time was

spent on issues that were marginal to the JFK story. For

example, several major evidence packages involving several

offices

and presentations by senior agency officers and

officials were needed to secure Board agreement to protect

Agency physical locations and

names of employees and other

persons not related to the JFK story.

Three times during the six years of the project, including

most of this past year, the JFK review effectively shut down

all other aspects of the Historical Review Program and had

to borrow additional resources from other offices and review

projects to meet deadlines. The JEK review will continue to

require a significant portion of HRP's resources through

Fy99.

III. The Process and Lessons Learned

There are a number of basic lessons from the JFK review

that are applicable to other historical/systematic review

projects:

We need reviewers with broad Agency experience, which

can be either managerial or substantive.

---

## Page 176

*

We need to establish early on what information is

already in the public domain and address the issue of

"official release"

in the context of each project.

*

Develop a strategy/policy with the IROs concerning the

release of information.

Be smart about it; do not accept

stonewalling by them on relevant information that can be

released.

At the same time, avoid confrontations with them

on marginal or non-relevant information.

On-site Directorate reviewers are the most effective

way to handle the internal coordination requirements of a

large project.

Without the DO's JFK team on site it would

have been impossible to complete the JFK project.

Develop quidelines and processes for coordinating Third

Agency documents; include other agencies in discussions; do

not drop documents into the black hole of other agencies'

FOIA offices without this advance discussion.

Maintain written, up-to-date, project-specific

This is no small task. A

"declassification guide" must be flexible; no guide can

anticipate all the issues which will arise in a review.

After six years, we were still revising the JFK guidelines

in the last month of the project.

In establishing deadlines, allow sufficient time to do

a thorough, professional job as required by the project

activities

(see Unrealistic Deadlines above) .

Ensure we have adequate support people for routine

processing tasks; declassification involves both tough

substantive analysis--and a lot of routine processing.

If possible, inventory/index all materials before the

review and processing begins.

Experienced indexers are a

must. Identification of duplicate documents should be a key

part of any inventory or index.

How a Reguest was Worked Following receipt of a

request and HRP tasking the responsible Agency component (s)

to conduct

a search, the materials found were first reviewed

by HRP staff

members before access was provided to the ARRE

staff.

ARRB staff then reviewed the documents and materials

and identified those which it believed were relevant to

their inquiry and these materials were placed in the normal

queue to be reviewed and processed for release. However,

the mere identification of materials did not equate to

automatic release. Rather, if particularly sensitive

information was involved, negotiations took place and, on

occasion, a written statement about the materials was

provided for release vice the actual document (s).

43. The Agency's written responses to each request -

either a letter or memoranda - included, of course, the fact

the materials designated were to be processed for release

according to then current guidelines. The ARRB staff then

wrote its own version of the request, search, and response.

Both of these are a part of the public record on this

project.

5A. Lessons learned: A number of things surfaced as

HRP worked to complete these requests which required

considerable explanation, negotiation, and resolution.

a. First among these was the fact there existed an

outside Board which asked for information and carefully

monitored the responses (a very powerful external Board with

subpoena authority), without doubt caused documents and

information to be found and made available that would not

have been provided to an internal declassification project.

b. Second, for any large project such as JFK to be

successful, there is an absolute requirement that each

directorate and independent office identify two responsible

persons -- a senior management official who can ensure that

deadlines (particularly deadlines established by an external

---

## Page 178

14-00000

authority) are met; and, a senior focal point officer who

has the substantive knowledge and background to both locate

all relevant material and make decisions on its sensitivity.

c. Third, the individuals identified and appointed

in sub-paragraph "b" next above must be fully versed in the

guidelines which pertain to each specific project. They

cannot rely on FOIA or other guidelines as to the depth of

their searches or the conditions governing release/

redaction/denial of materials.

IV

DRAFT: Section III, ARRB Requests for Additional

Information and Records

1.

Unlike most declassification projects, the Agency's

involvement in the JFK Project was governed by the dictates

of a Federal statute, the JFK Act, and the powers it vested

in the Board

it established - the Assassination Records

Review Board (ARRB). In particular, under Section 7, the

Act armed the ARRB with the authority to dig for records and

information, specifically:

... (1) The Review Board shall have the authority

to act in a manner prescribed under this Act, in-

cluding authority to --

(C) (ii) direct a Government office to make

available to the Review Board, and if necessary

investigate the facts surrounding, additional

information, records, or testimony from

individuals,

which the Review Board has reason

to believe is required to fulfill its functions

and responsibilities;

(F) hold hearings, administer oaths, and subpoena

witnesses and documents.

This substantial authority provided the ARRB and its staff

with almost unlimited access to Agency records and

personnel. It also was the basis for a number of specific

requests from the Board to the Agency for additional

information, document searches and explanatory papers. HRP

designated

this ARRB activity, "Special Reguests." During

its existence the ARRB sent to the Agency fifty-three

special requests, CIA 1-16 and CIA-IR 1-37.

2. Categories of Requests:

5B

## Page 180

53 special Request)

Although each request had unique characteristics,

all began as a request by the Board or an ARRB staff member

on behalf of the board for information. The requests fell

generally into five broad categories as follows:

a. Requests for access to basic information which

would help the board understand the CIA, its organizational

structure and how it operated around the time of the

assassination which included: Requests for organizational

charts, briefings, mission statements, etc.; review of over

_ histories of CIA offices and projects; a review of the

so-called "Breckinridge files;" and, a search for an IG

index of Oswald reports.

b. Requests about methodologies which included: How

cable traffic was handled at HQ during the relevant time

period; the existence and use of the inter-agency source

registry; and, the assignment and use of alias's pseudonyms,

crypts, etc.

c. Requests for subject specific matters which

included: The Mexico City Station annual reports; the

existence of DRE monthly reports; Oswald's pre assassination

files; and, a search for any documents or information

detailing the Agency's involvement in transporting and

processing the Zapruder film.

freedos

d. Requests for project specific information and

files, which included: Requests for information and files on

AMWORLD, QKENCHANT, an index to the HTLINGUAL materials, and

the Mexico City electronic surveillance tapes.

e. Requests for individual specific information

and files, which included both CIA and CIA associated

individuals and non-CIA individuals: Information on

individuals with JMWORLD; detailed information on Sylvia

Duran; a determination of the identify of a particular

"George Bush;" and, the files on William Pawley.

deletions in 1996 under the authority of the ARRB. Additional documents, filed into the

201 after the its transfer to HRG, were released in September 1998.

Office of Security File ( pages): Contained key Oswald documents, FBI investigative

reports, newspaper clipping. This file, primarily duplicative, was reviewed by the HSCA,

but a copy was not sequestered with the rest of the Agency's "JFK" collection. The file

surfaced as a result of an ARRB request in 1997. A declassified version of the file was

released in

1998.

DCD "A" File: A microfilm copy of this file was in the sequestered collection. The ARRB

requested that the original file by reviewed for release.

Marina Oswald's 201 file.

A copy of this file was in the sequestered collection. The

ARRB requested that the original file be reviewed for release.

The ARRB directed that the classified originals of all documents from the Oswald files

be transferred to NARA for secure storage. These documents were transferred to

NARA in October 1998.

The Sequestered Collection

At the end of its investigation, the HSCA directed that all materials (files,

documents, memos, notes, tapes, etc.) collected or prepared in response to its

investigation be sequestered. This included files made available for review, but not

reviewed by the HSCA staff

JFK boxes 1-63 (hardcopy): These boxes are the core of the Agency's JFK collection.

They are the working files/materials of the HSCA staff and reflects the wide range of

• issues pursued by the Committee. In addition to Agency documents, they include

approximately 30,000 pages of notes, letter and memos created by the HSCA or its

staff. The boxes are a combination of files on subjects and persons of interest to HSCA

including documents prepared by the Agency as a result of the investigation, eight

boxes of security files and Mexico City cable chrono files. The boxes contain a

significant amount of duplication (most of the Oswald 201 documents appear multiple

times in this part of the collection. A declassified version was released in August 1993,

then re-released under ARRB in 1997.

JFK Microfilm (72 reels): These reels are copies of Agency files that were made

available to HSCA staff. Although the HSCA interest usually focused on a small portion

of a file, the Committee sequestered the compete file. The microfilm includes

approximately 25 reels of 201 files, 6 reels of Office of Personnel files, 14 reels of

Anti/Castro - Cuban exile material, extensive files on Nosenko and operational and

production files from Mexico City. The microfilm also contains copies of all the Oswald

files except for the security file.

INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE

SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE GOVERNMENT REFORM AND

OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE

SUBJECT: ASSASSINATIONS RECORDS REVIEW BOARD REAUTHORIZATION

CHAIRED BY REPRESENTATIVE DENNIS HASTERT (R-IL)

2154 RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING

WASHINGTON, DC

BODY:

REP. HASTERT: The Subcommittee on National Security, International Affairs and

Criminal Justice will come to order. This hearing will focus on a very

important piece of legislation, HR 1553, the John F. Kennedy Assassination

Records Review Board Reauthorization Act. This bill was introduced by Chairman

Dan Burton on May 8, 1997 and included in original cosponsors ranking minority

member Henry Waxman and Congressman Louis Stokes, our first witness for today,

also who chaired the House Select Committee on Assassinations.

In 1992, 30 years after the assassination, nearly one million pages of records

compiled by official investigations still had been not made public. Congress

decided to set up a process for reviewing and releasing to the public the

records surrounding the Kennedy assassination. The result was that on October

26, 1992, President Bush signed into law Public Law 102-526, the President John

F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992.

The original act provided a three-year timetable for the review board to

complete its work. Unfortunately, extensive delays in the appointment of board

members delayed the review board's work from the very beginning. In 1994, the

Congress extended the 1992 law's termination date for one year, until September

30th, 1996. The review board subsequently exercised its authority into the

statute to continue operating for one additional year.

The review process has proved to be more complex and time- consuming than

---

" anticipated. And although we believe that Congress should not indefinitely

continue funding federal entities that were intended to be temporary, Chairman

Burton and this subcommittee support the request for a one-year extension of the

board's reauthorization. I believe that by releasing these documents to the

public we serve an important public right to know and advance the cause of total

accountability to the people of this country.

At this time I would like to recognize the gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr.

Barrett.

REP. THOMAS M. BARRETT (D-WI): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm honored to

welcome

my esteemed colleague, Representative Louis Stokes, to testify before this

subcommittee. We are fortunate to be able to draw on your experience in this

area.

Over 30 years ago this country was shocked by the assassination of President

Kennedy in a way that it had not been shocked since the bombing of Pearl Harbor

or the bombing or Hiroshima. Yet today we are still prying papers out of the

government about that assassination.

Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

The legislation that created the Assassination Review Board broke new ground by

establishing the principle that there should be a presumption of public access

to government information. That legislation was necessary because

administration after administration had falled to release documents. That

should not be. The Assassination Review Board has released millions of pages

that could have otherwise remained locked in government file drawers. We are

here today to extend the authorization of this board because the process of

making government information public has been more complex and time-consuming

than anticipated. I am not criticizing the work of the board or the dedication

of its members. I am, however, critical of the fact that we are still fighting

with our government to allow public access to government documents.

Congress has passed laws and resolutions reiterating the principles of public

access that were laid down when this country was founded. Administration after

administration has worked to thwart that access. I applaud President Clinton

for his efforts to declassify documents, but we need to do much more.

I hope that every employee at the Office of Management and Budget, and every

agency in the government will pay attention to what this board has accomplished.

It is the refusal to allow public access that breeds suspicion of the

government. It is the thwarting of public access that causes the public to

mistrust government officials. If we are to turn the tide of mistrust and

suspicion, it will be done by opening the doors of access. Today is one step in

that process, but there is much more work to be done.

Thank you.

REP. HASTERT: Are there any other members wishing to make an opening statement?

If not, our first witness this morning is fellow Congressman Lou Stokes, who

served as the chairman of the Höuse Select Committee on Assassinations from 1976

to 1979, and is a cosponsor of this important bill.

And, Mr. Stokes, we want to say welcome, and thank you for your fine work in

this area. And please proceed with your opening statement.

REP. LOUIS STOKES (D-OH): Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Barrett, Mr.

Turner, Mr. LaTourette.

Mr. Chairman, I'd like to submit my written testimony for the record, and if I

may, I'd like to just summarize my testimony.

REP. HASTERT: Without objection.

REP. STOKES: Thank you.

It seems, Mr. Chairman, it was not as long as it is, but actually it's been 20

years; it was in 1977 when I was appointed as chairman of the House Select

Committee on Assassinations. We were authorized at that time and directed to

complete an investigation surrounding the assassination and the death of

President John F. Kennedy. We completed, as you've already stated, our

---

## Page 186

• investigation in 1979. And on March 28th of that year, we filed our final

report. In addition to it, 12 volumes of evidentiary material, printed by the

Government Printing Office, was made available to the American public. In

addition to this, we conducted 18 days of public hearings and an additional two

days of public policy hearings.

Prior to the committee running out of both time and money, we had released

everything that we had the time and resources to release. All of our other

records were placed in the National Archives, under a House of Representatives

rule which existed at that time, Rule 36, requiring such unpublished records

routinely to be sealed for 30 to 50 years. The records of our committee

relative to this investigation consisted of 935 boxes, which we turned over to

the National Archives. Then, over the years, a considerable public debate about

these records has ensued, including accusations that these records, if released,

would contain evidence of a government cover-up, or complicity of government

agencies in the assassination of President Kennedy.

Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

A great deal of this was fueled in 1992 by a movie entitled "JFK." That movie

contained many distortions of the facts and circumstances surrounding the death

of our president. As a result of that movie, my office was deluged with

thousands of letters and telegrams by Americans calling for the release of these

sealed files.

As a member of Congress, and a former chairman of that committee, I deemed it

important not to have the good work of our committee impugned by such baseless

accusations. Our committee had attempted to conduct its investigation into the

assassination of the president, and to present the results of that investigation

to the Congress and to the American people in a thorough and dignified manner in

keeping with the memory of this great president.

Consequently, in 1992, I introduced, and the House and Senate passed, PL

102-526, a bill entitled The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records

Collection Act of 1992. That law created the Assassination Records Review

Board, which mandated and authorized that board to identify, secure, and make

available all records related to the assassination of President Kennedy. It was

our intention, Mr. Chairman, that everything that could be released from every

agency, every court record, anywhere they existed - that those records be

released to the American people.

Under the law, the board had until October 1, 1996, to fulfill its mandate, plus

an additional year, at the board's discretion.

We were very fortunate to have a very distinguished panel appointed. This panel

was appointed by President Clinton 18 months after the law was enacted here by

the Congress - a considerable delay in the appointment of this panel. But we

were very fortunate to have persons such as Chairman Tunheim, Dr. Henry Graff,

Dr. Kermit Hall, Dr. William Joyce, Dr. Anna Nelson, and an outstanding

executive director, David Marwell.

Under this panel, they have now released more than 10,000 previously secret

government documents.

They have released a report, which I would urge all the members of the committee

to read, if they have an opportunity, because I think you will see the extensive

They now need one additional final year in order to complete their work. Their

work during this period of time will be primarily to secure the release of

documents from the CIA and the FBI. Those are the two main agencies left from

which they still have a considerable number of documents to be released.

Mr. Chairman, in closing I think that it's important that we complete this work

in an orderly manner with full and complete disclosure to the American people,

that they will feel that they know everything that their government knows about

---

## Page 188

the assassination of their president. And I would urge the support and passage

of this legislation sponsored by Chairman Burton, of which I am one of the

original co-sponsors.

Id be pleased to answer any questions.

REP. HASTERT: Thank you, Chairman - or, Mr. Stokes. And I really appreciate

the work that you've done here. I have just two brief questions. Actually,

three. Do you believe that the Ford Review Board is up and running smoothly

REP. STOKES: Absolutely. In spite of the delay of 18 months they have done just

a yeoman's amount of work. It's just been almost incomparable to realize how

much they have done. And to their credit, they feel that if given just this one

additional year that they will complete the work.

REP. HASTERT: And do you believe that this process is consistent with the goals

of your original legislation in 1992?

REP. STOKES: Yes, I do, Mr. Chairman.

---

## Page 189

PAGE 19

Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

REP. HASTERT: And then you are confident, as you said before, that the review

board can finish its task by September 30th, 1998.

REP. STOKES: I am just very confident that - in projecting the fact that they............

can do this work with one year. And when they say themselves as they will say

to you when they appear, this'll be one final year.

REP. HASTERT: Thank you very much, and thank you for your testimony.

REP. STOKES: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

REP. HASTERT: The gentleman from Wisconsin.

REP. BARRETT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I don't have a lot of questions, either. I just want to compliment you,

Congressman Stokes, for the fine job that you have done.

REP. STOKES: Thank you.

REP. BARRETT: And just one question. Do you think in the unfortunate and

hopefully unlikely scenario that there are future assassinations in the future

that this was a good way to approach this problem, the panel that you served?

Do you think that you have accomplished what you intended to accomplish?

REP. STOKES: Mr. Barrett, at the time that we undertook this panel and Congress

passed the act to create this panel, 85 percent of the American people believed

that someone other than Lee Harvey Oswald had participated in the assassination

of President Kennedy. A national poll had told us that. There were boundless

rumors and myths. People were writing numerous books and things of that sort.

And as a consequence of it, I think that putting this panel together and

permitting this type of investigation I think was very helpful. I think it

allayed many of the rumors and myths that grew up and abounded around the

assassination of our president.

However, I don't think that it put to bed everything. We uncovered many things.

For instance, we pointed up many of the things that the Warren Commission had

not done properly. And we were able to destroy many of the myths; such as the

umbrella man theory and things of that sort. But we couldn't put everything to

bed. We had begun that investigation 15 years after the assassination of the

president. I think had we been given this type of investigation immediately

after it had occurred, it would have been a different result. But many of the

witnesses had died. Evidence had disappeared. As you can see now, there were

materials which we were not able to get even within that two-year period before

we went out of existence.

And so as a consequence of it, I think we did an outstanding job. No one has

ever been able to refute any of the work that we did. No one has been able thus

far to say anything was ever covered up from the American people. And so to

that degree, I think that it performed a good service for the American people.

REP. HASTERT: Okay, thank you very much.

The gentleman from Ohio.

REP. STEVEN LATOURETTE (R-OH): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I *

want to

thank you for having this hearing today and for also expediting the markup on

1553, and give praise to the co- sponsors, our chairman, Mr. Burton, Mr. Waxman,

and also to Congressman Stokes.

The editorial comment I would make is I'm always amazed each succeeding day that

I serve in Congress at the rich history that a number of our colleagues have,

and to now have our fine colleague from Ohio, Congressman Stokes from Cleveland,

here and talk about his previous work on the House Select Committee on

Assassinations. Although many members in the House remember his service, I would

venture to say there are a number of people back home that don't know all of the

things that you've done during your many years of service to this Congress and

this country.

Just as an example, the other day I found out — and I don't know if you're a

---

## Page 191

PAGE 20

Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

lawyer or not, Mr. Chairman, but I found out that Congressman Stokes - well,

you're lucky you're not a lawyer, but I am, and I'm proud to be a lawyer.

1 found out that Congressman Stokes was responsible for a ruling called Terry

versus Ohio, and you might have heard of a "Terry Frisk and Search," and I

didn't know that till the other day, that Congressman Stokes had a hand in that,

and so, again, we find Congressman Stokes showing up again, sharing his

expertise with the country.

Lou, the one question I would have, deals with, in both your written testimony,

and then also your observations to Congressman Baird's question. You talked

about the "JFK" movie, and all of the rumors and innuendoes and the public

polls. And you still run into people - as I'm sure - I still run into people

that aren't convinced that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone on that November day in

Dallas.

And part of it has to do, I think, with, after your commission met, and now the

legislation in '92, and a little delay in getting everybody in place in the

review board. Do you think it was necessary, after you've reviewed the

documents in this case, that we waited, as a government, 34 years to make these

documents available? Was there something impinging upon the national security

that you found or discovered that made it necessary for the government to wait

34 full years before releasing this information, and hopefully dispelling some

of those rumors?

REP. STOKES: Thank you very much, Mr. LaTourette, firstly for your nice remarks.

But it's a good question, because not many people realize that this was not -

when we sealed these records for the period 30 to 50 years, this was not done

because of anything relative to this particular investigation. That was a House

rule in existence at that time, that applied to any committee that, when it

completed its work and filed its final report, if they had documents which had

not been released publicly, under that House rule, they had to be sealed for 30

to 50 years. The same applied to the other part of that investigation which we

conducted, which was to investigate the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King

Jr., which was a companion part of our investigation. So that applied to that

one also.

But as a result of it, in compliance with the House rule, it just sort of sat

there until things were stirred up by that "JFK" movie and it sort of brought

things to the head.

REP. LATOURETTE: Okay. The principles behind your '92 legislation, the

Assassination Records Collection Act - obviously, now we collect records

differently than we did before. A lot of them are electronically stored. Do

you think that we can use that act as a vehicle, should another tragedy - God

forbid we should ever have such another tragedy in this country, but should

---

## Page 192

14-00000

..adots

another tragedy such as this occur, could we use the lessons learned in the

model of this review board to prevent the significant time lag between the date

of event and the eventual release of documents for public review?

REP. STOKES: I would hope, Mr. LaTourette, that we have learned some lessons.

Firstly, here in the Congress we'd no longer have such a rule in effect, and

that will help us, I think, tremendously.

But also, I think, by the agencies now working with a review panel of this sort

and realizing that many of the type of documents which they will cite to you in

their testimony - for instance, there's a very interesting document that they

will talk about, where the whole page, with the exception of just the date and

the name of a country - everything was redacted. And under their work, that

whole page has been released, and everyone can read that.

What you do by that is that you're to allay all the suspicion as to what really

has been redacted and people can really see. And then you can't have the kind

of rumors and myths that grow up around it.

---

## Page 193

PAGE 21

Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

And I think and hope that in the event of such an occurrence in the future -

which all of us hope would never occur - that our agencies will realize that

this has been a good example of how we could allay some of the fears and

suspicions that the American people have around the manner in which we conduct

this type of thing.

REP. LATOURETTE: Thank you very much, Congressman Stokes, for your expertise —

REP. STOKES: Thank you.

REP. LATOURETTE: - and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding.

REP. HASTERI: Thank you.

And at this time I recognize the gentleman from Texas.

REP. JIM TURNER (D-TX): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

And all I would add is to also compliment you, Mr. Stokes, for your many years

of work on this effort. I too stand somewhat in awe at the number of years of

service and your contributions to this body.

REP. STOKES: Thank you.

REP. TURNER: And I know the Congress and the American people are grateful for

the years of service you've provided not only on this issue, but on many other

issues to which you've contributed.

And I also want to thank those who've served on this panel, because I'm sure it

is a time-consuming endeavor to carry out this task.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

REP. HASTERT: Thank you, Mr. Turner.

Thank you, Mr. Stokes.

REP. STOKES: Thank you.

REP. HASTERT: The second panel, come forward, please.

Our distinguished second panel includes four witnesses: Mr. John Tunheim, the

chair of the Assassination Records Review Board; Mr. Steven Tilley, the chief of

the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection at the National Archives.

We also have Mr. Max Holland, the author and contributing editor of the Wilson

Quarterly; and Mr. Bruce Hitchcock, an historian and teacher at Noblesville High

School in Indiana, our distinguished chairman's home state.

And I also would say that, at this time, Mr. Burton would have wanted to be here

to make a few comments. He is not here yet. We may entertain that at any time.

So, if you gentlemen would please stand, and - (witnesses are sworn in). Thank

you. Let the record show that the witnesses answered in the affirmative.

And we start with you, Mr. Tunheim.

JOHN TUNHEIM (Chair, Assassination Records Review Board): Thank you, Mr.

Chairman. I, too, would like to submit my written testimony for the record and

---

## Page 194

just give a brief summary to members of the subcommittee today.

Id like to thank the subcommittee for this opportunity to testify today in

favor of House bill 1553. And I'd also like to note our thanks to Congressman

Stokes for his leadership on this issue and his guidance in the important effort

to release the records relating to the tragic assassination of President

Kennedy.

The review board is confident that the additional time requested and provided by

Congressman Burton's bill will allow us to complete our work and submit a truly

complete final report to the Congress, to the president and to the American

public. I'd like to thank Chairman Burton for introducing the bill and

Congressman Waxman and Stokes for co-sponsoring the bill that is before the

subcommittee today. And I also appreciate, Mr. Chairman, your role in chairing

this hearing today and assisting in this effort.

One of the other members of the review board is present with us today -- I'd

like to introduce her - Dr. Anna Nelson, who is the distinguished adjunct

---

## Page 195

PAGE 22

Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

historian in residence at the American University and is seated in the row

directly behind me. Dr. David Marwell, the executive director of the review

board, is also here, as are a number of staff members who are very professional

and very dedicated and have done their work for us very well.

The review board, Mr. Chairman, began releasing records in July of 1995,

pursuant to the act passed by Congress. And thus far, the board has acted

specifically to transfer more than 14,000 documents to the JFK collection at the

National Archives. That collection, as Mr. Tilley will tell the subcommittee

shortly, now contains more than 3.7 million pages' worth of material.

I'd like to show one brief and rather dramatic example of the work that the

review board is doing. Congressman Stokes mentioned this issue in his

testimony. This involves one particular record. This is the "before" version,

the record that was available to the public up until several years ago. You

probably cannot see it from here, but it is a document that was sent from the

FBI's representative in Paris to Director Hoover on October 12, 1960. That is

indicated at the top of the memorandum. The subject, as indicated, is Lee

Harvey Oswald: Internal Security. And then it says Re: Paris Letter 9-27- 60.

And the remainder of the entire document is blacked out. And not surprisingly,

a document like this dated three years prior to the assassination of President.

Kennedy, a document sent to J. Edgar Hoover attracted a great deal of interest

among researchers who saw it because everything was blacked out underneath. The

speculation that individuals had about this was great.

Well, the board aggressively pursued the release of this information, initially

ordering its release. The FBl appealed that decision to the president.

Subsequently we worked out with them, including an aggressive effort to contact

Swiss authorities who were the subject of this particular document. I met

personally with the Swiss ambassador to the United States to ask for his

assistance in obtaining Swiss approval to release it.

And here is the record that is now released to the American public at the

National Archives. All of the material is released. And what it indicates was

the FBI was interested in whether Oswald was indeed attending a college in

Switzerland during that period of time. And the document tells about the

investigation that Swiss authorities did to determine whether Oswald was,

indeed, enrolled. He was someone who the FBI was following because of his

interest in defecting to the Soviet Union. That's a good example of the type of

work that the review board is doing: pursuing individual releases of information

that has long been redacted from the public.

The board has worked closely with federal agencies. The vast majority of the

records are at the CIA and the FBI. We have completed the review of the core

collections in both of those agencies and significant numbers of materials have

---

## Page 196

14-00000

been released.

The board has also been aggressive in identifying and acquiring significant

assassination-related records that have been in the hands of private citizens

and local governments. Just a couple of examples:

The papers of J. Lee Rankin, who was the chief counsel to the Warren Commission,

have now been released through the efforts of the review board. Virtually all

of the records of the prosecution in New Orleans of Clay Shaw was also released.

And I'm announcing for the first time today that the review board has just

acquired the original personal papers of Clay Shaw. He was the individual

prosecuted in New Orleans in 1969, the only individual prosecuted for the

assassination of President Kennedy. That will add another dimension to this

story. This is an example of his diary, which the board has just obtained, and

will be released as soon as we can process the materials. It's very

interesting. It's his diary from the day that he was arrested, on March 1st,

1967 and his feelings about Oswald on that particular day.

## Page 197

PAGE 23

Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

Despite the best estimate, Mr. Chairman, that this job could be done in three

years, we cannot finish our work by the end of this fiscal year. We're

confident that in the additional year we will be able to get through the

records, which will largely involve the sequestered collections at the CIA and

at the FBI - records sequestered by the House Select Committee on

Assassinations. I'd be happy to answer any questions, Mr. Chairman, that you

and the members have.

REP. HASTERT: Thank you. We'll hold all the questions until the end of the

testimony.

MR. TUNHEIM: Very well.

REP. HASTERI: Mr. Tilley?

STEVEN TILLEY (Chief, Access and Freedom of Information Staff, National Archives

and Records Administration): Mr. Chairman, I am Steven Tilley, and I'm the chief

of the Access and Freedom of Information Staff at the National Archives and

Records Administration. And I wish to thank you for the opportunity to testify

today on behalf - for the National Archives in support of HR 1553.

I'm appearing today in my capacity of NARA's chief of the President John F.

Kennedy Assassination Records Collection. In that role, I am charged with

implementing NARA's responsibilities under the act, and I serve as NARA'S

liaison to the Assassination Records Review Board. And it's my understanding

that my written statement will be made part of the record, therefore, I'll be

brief in my remarks.

Mr. Chairman, this month marks the 20th anniversary of the closing of the office

of the Watergate Special Prosecution Force. I oversaw the closing of that

office and supervised the transfer of those records to the National Archives.

Most of my career at the Nationäl Archives since then has been involved with

working with sensitive records. And in 1993, I became the chief of the JFK

Collection, and I've served in that capacity ever since.

When the review board members were confirmed by the Senate in April of 1994, my

staff and I began to work with the board, and later with the board staff, to

provide information on the records in the JFK Collection, the development and

use of NARA's data base, our contacts and discussions with other agencies

involved in searches for assassination records, and the existence of

assassination records in the custody of private repositories or individuals.

The review board and NARA have maintained an excellent working relationship

through the three years of the board's existence, and I'd like to think that

this close relationship has in some way contributed to the success of the review

board.

NARA enthusiastically supports passage of HR 1553 to extend the review board's

authorization.

---

## Page 198

The board needs the time designated in this bill to complete its important work

in making available as complete a historical record as possible concerning the

assassination of President Kennedy.

I would like to briefly offer for your consideration some statistics and facts

to demonstrate the success of the board. The JFK Assassination Records

Collection has grown to more than 1,600 cubic feet of records, or approximately

3.75 million pages from more than 30 different government offices. These

numbers are a testament to the work of the board in obtaining the cooperation of

the entire federal government as well as private donors in this important task.

For the information of the committee, Mr. Chairman, I've attached to my

testimony a copy of the register of the collection, which lists the major groups

of federal records and private papers along with a supplemental listing of FBI

records.

Not only has the collection increased dramatically in size; the significance

---

## Page 199

14-00000

PAGE 24

of the records in the collection cannot be underestimated. In addition to the

records of numerous executive branch agencies and offices, the records of

relevant congressional committees, related court cases, and records donated by

private entities are also available in the collection.

This rich documentation is searchable electronically, giving researchers the

ability to seek out documents concerning a topic, person or event, or even

individual documents, not only at NARA's College Park facility but from their

own personal computer through the Internet.

Finally, Mr. Chairman, public demand for these records is the ultimate evidence

of the value of this collection. Reference requests have risen in number every

year since the collection opened with new records in August of 1993. This year

we have already received over 600 written inquiries, an increase of over 30

percent from this period of time last year. The number of inquiries on our

computer Web site is also steadily increasing. Since March 1996, when the

assassination records database was made available through the Internet, it has

been accessed over 100,000 times by the public.

Due to the exceptional work of the Assassination Records Review Board, great

progress has been made on making available as complete a record as possible in

the history of the assassination of John Kennedy. Without the focus, integrity

and expertise of the review board, the collection would not have the size,

quality or public demand witnessed today.

However, there is still much to do. NARA supports passage of HR 1553 so this

important work can be completed.

That concludes my statement, Mr. Chairman. I'll be glad to answer any

questions.

REP. HASTERT: Thank the gentleman.

Mr. Holland?

MAX HOLLAND (Author, contributing editor of Wilson Quarterly): Thank you, Mr.

Chairman. I'd like to make a brief statement summarizing my testimony.

Nearly 75 years after President Lincoln's assassination, a chemist-turned-author

named Otto Eisenschiml provoked a national furor with his 1937 book, "Why Was

Lincoln Murdered?" Eisenschiml claimed one of the most important events in

American history was still a mystery. And Eisenschiml claimed to have uncovered

the truth: President Lincoln was the victim of a conspiracy organized by his

secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, who was allegedly opposed to the president's

program for a charitable post-war reconstruction of the South.

When pressed, Otto Eisenschiml openly admitted that he had no evidence to

support his case. At the same time, it was precisely the documentary record

that enabled critics to prove that Eisenschim's book was just another in a long

line of lunatic theories about the first assassination of an American president.

Here lies, I submit, the long-term importance of the work being carried out by

the AARB. The meaning of the raw data being unearthed by the review board will

probably not be appreciated any time soon by the generations sentient when

President Kennedy was murdered in Dallas, but if these generations cannot come

to terms with history as it happened in their lifetimes, then at the very least,

they have an obligation to hand over, insofar as possible, a complete and

thorough documentary record. Citizens will need that record to rebut the Otto. -

Eisenschimls of the next century, not that there is any dearth of them now.

I strongly support without qualification extension of the review board for

another year and full funding of its operations. Bringing its work to an abrupt

end would not only diminish the investment of time and resources already made;

in all likelihood, it would throw the whole initiative into chaos. Not least of

all, gutting the effort now would surely create ineradicable suspicion about the

federal government's intentions in the first place. I'd like to spend the

balance of my time describing the three areas where I thank the review board

---

## Page 201

had made its greatest contributions. The first has to do with the Warren

Commission. The review board's labors have resulted in many new documents that

I believe will eventually remove the stigma that has been attached to the

commission, which is probably the most unfairly reviled and /or ridiculed entity

ever created by the federal government.

These records paint a sobering portrait of our federal government during a very

traumatic time. It's not the idealized versions depicted in civics text books

nor the demonized version featured on talk radio. It's the real federal

government: imperfect, plodding, riven by ambition, distrust, rivalries,

compartmentalized by secrecy, working at cross-purposes or in ignorance,

simultaneously guided by the most banal bureaucratic instincts and the most

elevated national concerns. Somehow, through all of that, it does struggle and

manage to do the right thing.

Besides the Warren Commission, I think the work of the review board has made a

very substantial contribution towards understanding the operations of the

intelligence community. The assassination necessarily caused what could only be

termed a mobilization of the U.S. intelligence community's far-flung resources.

The government had to determine that weekend who was responsible and whether the

assassin or assassins had any co-conspirators either foreign or domestic.

Consequently the records being released now constitute a gold mine of

information about domestic and foreign intelligence operations at the midpoint

of the cold war. These records not only shed new light on what the government

knew 34 years ago; the release is an object lesson in why they were kept secret

for all those years. They do not contradict the federal government's official

conclusion at stated in the Warren report. Rather, the documents were kept

secret because they disclosed or tended to disclose ongoing intelligence sources

and methods.

With the release of these documents, the intelligence community's record in the

wake of the assassination can finally be assessed with some fairness and

thoroughness. The fact is that the information provided by the FBI, CIA and

other agencies was instrumental to preventing the United States government from

overreacting when the circumstantial public evidence was highly suggestive of a

link between Lee Harvey Oswald and a foreign power.

The last area in which the review board has made a - perhaps its greatest

contribution has to do with whole issue of secrecy and disclosure. The balance

between secrecy and disclosure has always been in favor of secrecy, especially

since World War II, controlled by laws highly deferential to the equities of the

interested government agencies. The five citizens who serve on the review board

decided that if their mandate was to have any meaning it was imperative to

pierce this veil. They had to get at categories that had been classified here

before, including information derived from intelligence sources and methods.

While some historians have been critical of the resources devoted to this

particular effort, I like to believe that a breakthrough had to be achieved

somewhere, and in fact, the records pertaining to President Kennedy's

assassination make an excellent demonstration project of what can now be

released. The lines drawn by the review board should prove helpful as the

government undertakes to declassify the vast body of records generated during

the Cold War.

Finally, I'd like to say the entire history of the federal government's efforts

in the wake of the assassination, including the experience of the review board,

serves as a cautionary tale. Perhaps it will enable the government to strike a

better balance between secrecy and disclosure in the future, for there exists no

better example of the heavy wages of doubt, suspicion and public cynicism

exacted by secrecy than the Kennedy assassination experience.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

REP. HASTERT: I thank the gentleman.

And now, Mr. Hitchcock, I'd like to welcome you especially. A gentleman from

Ohio asked me a little while ago if I was an attorney. Indeed, I was not an

attorney, I happened to be a history teacher for 16 years before I ever got into

politics. So it's certainly a noble trade, and happy that you're here. I know

the chairman wanted to introduce you personally, but he couldn't make it this

afternoon.

You have contributed students, I understand, a clerk for this commission, and

have been involved in it at a very high degree. So we welcome you and listen to

your testimony.

BRUCE HITCHCOCK (Teacher, Noblesville High School, Indiana): Thank you, Mr.

Chairman. And I, too, would ask that my written statement be entered into the

record and I will briefly summarize.

REP. HASTERT: Without objection, all written statements will be entered into the

record.

MR. HITCHCOCK: Thank you.

My name is Bruce Hitchcock and I am a teacher at Noblesville High School located

in Noblesville, Indiana, which is a community approximately 20 miles north of

Indianapolis. I am currently completing my 28th year in secondary education.

My teaching assignment has primarily been in the areas of United States history,

American government, and international relations.

And I want to express my appreciation to the committee for affording me the

honor and privilege of being here today and permitting me to make some brief

remarks concerning an issue about which I have very strong convictions not only

as a citizen, but as an educator.

In the spring of 1994, I assigned my Honors United States history class a

project studying the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. This project

culminated in the students placing the Warren Commission Report on trial. Half

of the class represented the prosecution and half the class defended the Warren

Commission Report. The class became quite interested in, and many would say

obsessed with this subject. The project resulted in a trial which became quite

intense and divisive, so much so that the class had to have a party at the end

of the semester to rekindle friendships. They became so fascinated with the

subject of the assassination that they requested an opportunity to travel to

Washington, DC during the summer following their graduation to do additional

research.

From that modest class assignment developed an internship opportunity with the

JFK Assassination Records Review Board. To date, four student groups from

---

## Page 204

14-00000

Noblesville High School have interned with the review board, with the fifth

scheduled for the week of June 16th of this year. When this group completes its

work, a total of 56 of our students will have participated in this unique and

truly educational opportunity.

I might add that except for the first group, succeeding student groups have

studied, researched and prepared for their internship on their own time, outside

normal class meetings. The most recent group to participate did so over spring

break. The fact that students wanted to spend their vacation working with

government records reflects the interest that the JFK assassination has for

students.

In my 28 years of teaching, I have never had a topic create as much interest as

the assassination of President Kennedy. It is a mystery, and it provides an

excellent research opportunity, as well as a chance for students to be actively

involved in learning.

Since November 22nd, 1963, there have been many who have believed, and still

---

## Page 205

PAGE 27

Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

believe the government did conceal, continues to conceal, and will continue to

conceal the truth. If the review board is permitted time to complete its work,

it will assist in defusing the last two charges. We cannot prevent the

speculation that someone did conceal the truth. But the argument that a

cover-up continues, and will continue, can at least be defused, or discouraged

What has been lost cannot be replaced. However, what still exists can be made

public. We should have access, and our students should have access to the

information and documents still in existence. This is an opportunity for the

United States government to provide a credible response to public interest. The

review board established by the Congress, is actually a group of citizens

telling the government what to do, and what to release. An opportunity exists,

in this era of skepticism, to restore some credibility and trust in the

government.

In his recent book, "The Approaching Fury," author Stephen B. Oates quotes John

Furling as saying, "Events by themselves are unimportant. It is the perception

of events that is crucial."

Perhaps in 1997, the most important aspect concerning the assassination of

President Kennedy, is the perception, shared by many, of a conspiracy involving

individuals and agencies of the United States government. Do we not owe our

young people the opportunity to form the most accurate perception possible? Do

we not owe them the chance to see as much of the truth intact as can be

assembled?

It seems to me that we owe this generation, and all succeeding generations, the

opportunity to question, to study, and to form opinions on the basis of

information they can view independently, without solely relying on the opinions

of others. Oftentimes, while I'm in the classroom, I observe students who have

opinions, but little to substantiate them. Congress has a chance before it in

some small way — or maybe in some large way — to at least provide them with

more information, so that they may have their turn in determining what the JFK

assassination means.

We have been affected by this event. For 34 years we have been affected. The 56

students from Noblesville High School have, as have countless others, been

affected by the events of November 22nd, 1963.

The study of this event has the public interest. It is an event to which the

public and students can relate. It touches people.

As an aside, last week an article was published in the Indianapolis Star. I have

a copy with me today. Regarding our school's ongoing JFK assassination project.

Within a day of its publication I received phone calls from a gentleman offering

500 pages of documents for our use. And from a former teacher calling me with

information regarding some scholarship opportunities. I also received a call

---

## Page 206

from ABC News Nightline. And yesterday before leaving Noblesville High School

received a call from Atlanta, Georgia offering information.

The subject of the call from Nightline was seeking information as to what

Noblesville High School students were doing with regard to the study of the

assassination. Together I think these calls reflect continued local and national

interest in continuing the probe into what happened in Dallas. Congress has the

opportunity to lay the facts before the American public and permit a more

reasoned, rational and fact-based account and discussion of the assassination.

I would hope that the committee would take into consideration the fact that the

review board had a one-year delay before truly becoming operational, that it is

making a one-time request for an extension, that the review board has been on

task and on budget, that the review board has conducted its business in a

professional and non-partisan manner, and in 1992, when the act was passed by

this Congress and signed by President Bush, the enormity of the task was not

---

and could not be fully appreciated.

An opportunity exists to complete a task which I believe is overwhelmingly

supported by the American public, and it is important that this mission and

mandate authorized by Congress be completed. I would like to end with just a

couple of quotes, one from former Senator Bob Dole, who said in a different

context, this is not about only who we are. It is about have we made a

difference. This is a chance to make a difference. And as former President

Reagan often said, if not us, who, and if not now, when?

After 34 years it is time to let the public know the facts that remain. To do

less would be a tragedy and a travesty. As an educator I believe that our most

important task is to provide our young people the most complete story of who we

are and why we are who we are. We have an opportunity to work towards the

accomplishment of that goal. It is an opportunity, I believe, we cannot afford

to miss.

In his last speech in Fort Worth on November 22nd, 1963, President Kennedy said,.

we would like to live as we once lived, but history will not permit it. History

can only be served by permitting the public to see the evidence.

Mr. Chairman, as a further aside, if I might just have a few seconds. Reflective

of our students' interest in this event, I have my honors government classes

perform a project for the model Congress. One of the students this year - they

could write a bill or whatever subject they wished, and one student who worked

with the review board last yeär introduced House concurrent resolution 1 in

support of the review board, and concludes, after all the whereas's, the

Congress of the United States firmly supports the assassination records review

board in all endeavors leading to the collection, review and release of the

documents regarding the assassination of President Kennedy and supports the

extension of the life of the ARRB for an additional fiscal year.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

REP. HASTERT: We thank the gentleman and thank the panel. Now, I recognize the

gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. Barrett.

REP. BARRETT: Mr. Hitchcock, can you give us the name of that student so we can

make him or her an honorary co-sponsor? Might as well get the name in the

record.

MR. HITCHCOCK: Abigail Meyer, M-e-y-e-r.

REP. BARRETT: Judge Tunheim, you mentioned that you were releasing some

materials from Clay Shaw's diary and perhaps other things. Is there any

information in here that you hind particularly interesting?

MR. TUNHEIM: Mr. Barrett, I've not had a chance to go through it. We've just

gotten these materials in the last week through some aggressive efforts on our

---

.

staff. The page that I cited to you is interesting in that he made the notation

in there and it's a portion of it in his own handwriting that it was perhaps

unfortunate that he had never met Oswald because then he might have possibly

been a tiny footnote in history, an ironic statement given the role that he

played in the trial.

We've not had a chance to analyze it thoroughly yet. It does contain his

reactions to events as they were going on around him during the course of the

prosecution and certainly supports his view that he was not involved whatsoever

in the assassination, which ultimately was the view of the jury that acquitted

him.

REP. BARRETT: For my benefit, as a person who has not been immersed in this

issue at all. You just mentioned it took some aggressive work from your staff to

get this released. Can you tell me what that entailed, where it was, why it was

so difficult to get this information?

MR. TUNHEIM: Certainly. Part of this, this is an investigation into where

---

## Page 210

ists

PAGE 29

Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

records are. The bulk of our work has been with federal agencies that hold

assassination records. But we've also, at the direction of Congress in the bill

that was passed, entertained a search for records wherever they might be.

Records that are in private hands are not records that we can subpoena and take

from people, so we have to find where they are.

Staff members go out, talk to people, encourage them to donate those records to

the American public, to the National Archives. That was done in this case. We

received a tip that an individual had records that were left over from Mr. Shaw,

and start went and talked to the person, spent time with the person, encouraged

them to share those records with the American public, and that's how it was

developed.

REP. BARRETT: How do you determine which assassination records you can disclose

now and which just have to wait?

MR. TUNHEIM: Well, there's a standard that's set up by the act. There's first of

all a presumption that all records should be public. That presumption has

governed what the board has done throughout the process. But then there's a

standard where the board has to weigh the public interest in a particular record

or information with the potential harm that might be caused by release of the

material.

The standards that we look at are, are there national security interests such as

disclosure of an intelligence agent whose name hasn't been disclosed and whether

that person perhaps may be in some danger if that name was released publicly.

Does it disclose a method of protecting the president that is not generally

known today, so therefore it might be a threat to the president. Are there

personal privacy considerations that are involved.

I will tell you that when all is said and done, a very, very tiny percentage of

information gets redacted under the standards that we are applying, and the

process of going through the records has led the board to arrive at a number of

policy decisions which the agencies by and large are now following in their own

review of records, and therefore decisions that we had to make two years ago now

we don't have to make because the agency is following the advice of the board

made on earlier records.

REP. BARRETT: As long as there are some records that are not being released, do

you think that we will inevitably face criticism from some people in the

American public that there is still some sort of cover-up? I make reference to

Mr. Holland's comments about a book being written 75 years after President

Lincoln's assassination.

Will the time ever come, do you think, when all records will be released?

---

## Page 211

14-00000

• MR. TUNHEIM: I think it will, Mr. Barrett. The board is releasing every record.

The question is whether certain information on these records gets redacted of

not. For every redaction we are attaching a specific release date. Some of the

dates are five years in the future. The law that was passed which established

the review board provided that all records that are redacted, all information

redacted will be released in 2017 unless whoever is president at that time makes

a specifics determination that the record cannot be released because of some

continuing national security concern.

So we expect that virtually all of the information by 2017 will be released but

a very high percentage, in the 99.999 range is being released right now.

REP. BARRETT: Mr. Tilley, in your written statement you indicate that the

collections currently consist of 3.75 million pages. What's your estimate of how

many more records need to be reviewed?

MR. TILLEY: Well, it's hard to say because there is still a good deal of

material that's being reviewed by agencies at this time. But we have located

---

## Page 212

14-00000

PAGE 30

Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

some records at the National Archives that are still under review, such as the

Secretary of Army's records dealing with Operation Mongoose, the campaign to

destabilize the Cuban government in the period after the Bay of Pigs.

Other records have been located at other agencies. I received a call from the

Customs Bureau today and they will be turning over their assassination records

to me hopefully this afternoon. After this hearing is over I'll be picking up

the records they've located.

So it's tough to say how much is still out there but I think there's still going

to be another considerable amount of material, probably will be added to the

collection before this process is finished.

REP. BARRETT: Millions of pages?

MR. TILLEY: Oh, no. I would say probably, if we had another half a million

pages, that might be the extent of it. But what's interesting and fascinating

about this process is that we continue to turn up records where we did not know

there were records before. As agencies are aware of this effort, they have come

to the board. And the board is responsible for a lot of this by their aggressive

wain, but think we eries, a i goni ant as event do wier the collecteeks and

years ahead.

REP. BARRETT: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

REP. HASTERT: Mr. Tunheim, I have just a very short question. You mentioned the

movie that came out, JFK, and Mr. Oliver Stone's work in there. Did Mr. Stone

ever have any questions of your work at all, or did he do research?

MR. TUNHEIM: Mr. Stone has been very supportive of the work of the review board.

He testified before the Congress when this bill was passed initially,

encouraging broad release of thé records. He sent a representative to one of our

public hearings who testified and spoke very favorably about the work of the

board. So he's been strongly supportive and we've appreciated that support.

REP. HASTERT: Why have you waited to this point in the process to begin

reviewing the CIA and FBI records?

MR. TUNHEIM: Well, we've been reviewing CIA records and FBI records from the

very beginning, Mr. Chairman. The volume of records in those agencies is really

significant. We have completed the entire review of the core collections of

those agencies and those are numbers, between the two agencies, it's more than a

million pages of records.

What we are doing right now are delving into what's called the sequestered

collection in both of these agencies. Within the CIA these are records that the

House Select Committee on Assassinations asked to be sequestered, taken away

from their files and kept in a secure place for future review. The House Select

Committee did not have time to review these records carefully. Some of them are

---

## Page 213

14-00000

highly relevant to the assassination, others are not. Within the CIA there are

about 62 boxes of material and 72 reels of microfilm.

In the FBI in the same kind of sequestered collection is about 280,000 pages of

records. Those records are the focus of the review board's work over the next

year, if we get the extension.

REP. HASTERT: Let me ask the same question I asked the previous panel. Do you

think that you can finish your work by the end of the fiscal year 1998?

MK. IILLEY: Mr. Chairman, I'm confident that the board can complete its work.

Members of the review board are confident. We will make every effort to ensure

that it gets done. In fact, we intend to provide to your staff a timeline which

sets out our anticipation of how we will review these records over the next

year.

We have set up a review process that we're working on right now that's moving

quickly and we are confident that the work can be done. We were set up to be a

temporary board and no one on the board wishes this effort to take a long

---

## Page 214

time. We need to get the information to the American public.

REP. HASTERT: Thank you very much. Mr. Hitchcock, I want to ask you, bringing

students into the real realm of research and learning in that respect, how :

important is it that records like this be made available to the public so that

folks like yourself can have the availability for students?

мк. HICHCO: I think, Mr. Chairman, it is extremely important for not only

teachers of history and historians but also for future students and future

generations. One of the things so special about our relationship with the review

board has not only been an opportunity for students to travel to Washington, and

they pay their own way and they do their own research on their on time. But it

has helped change opinions in many cases by students about not only the

assassination but about government, politics, agencies and people who work for

the government.

I cannot overstate the importance this has had for the 43 thus far, and soon to

be 56, students from Noblesville High School who have had this research

opportunity, that have been able actually to see, handle original documents, to

work with documents, to see firsthand the evidence that exists. To have that

opportunity is something that no teacher, no classroom, no film, no laser disk,

nothing in the classroom can simulate such interest and focus as this trip to

Washington DC, the review of documents, the working with people that we've had

the opportunity to be with at the review board on a firsthand basis.

It is just something that cannot be duplicated, or as I said, simulated in any

classroom anywhere in the country. It's just been a fantastic opportunity and

will provide students in the future with a place to go to find those records, to

look at the records, to look at the documents, and be at least assured that as

much as is available and is in existence can now be made available to them as

ordinary citizens of this country, whether they be students at a university,

students at a high school, or in their just curiosity and interest as American

citizens.

I don't think it can be overstated the impact that this will have in helping

bridge that gap of skepticism, if this is the correct way to say it, that

exists. I just cannot imagine what the many conspiracy theorists out there would

think if the review board has to finish its stay without completing its work.

REP. HASTERT: Thank you. The gentleman from Ohio.

REP. LATOURETTE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

And Mr. Chairman, I would begin by indicating that my earlier query about your

legal training was not meant to be an affront, and I should have recognized that

your learned demeanor was that of a --

REP. HASTERT: Not at all.

---

## Page 215

REP. LATOURETTE: Mr. Howe, I don't have a question but I'm glad you told the

story of Otto Eisenschiml because somewhere in the back of my mind I remember a

book or movie called the Lincoln conspiracy and I was certain that Secretary

Stanton had something to do with the demise of our sixteenth president, so I'm

glad you brought that up.

Mr. Tunheim, I do want to ask you a follow-up question to what we were talking

to Congressmen Stokes about and I was fascinated by the document that you held

up. When I was in the prosecution business and we had a public records law in

Ohio which was new on the books, we found that law enforcement agencies always

wanted to take a big black magic marker and redact everything. It was my view

that that led to more conjecture, rumor, suspicion than not, and I think this

document that you brought forward, knowing that it came from the swiss federal

police, that would give, I think, some cause to believe that Mr. Oswald had some

Swiss bank account and was squirreling away money from foreign nationals as part

of a conspiracy.

---

## Page 216

14-00000

PAGE 32

Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

When you un-redact it, if that's really a word, you find out like so many other

people he apparently registered for the Albert Schweitzer College for the fall

semester of 1960 and didn't show up. Nothing sinister or unusual in that at all..

The question I have is, when you were testifying you indicated that the FBI

originally appealed the decision to not-or to withdraw the redaction of this

particular document. You also indicated that the vast majority of documents that

you have left to review during this renewal period are located at the CIA and

the FBI in the sequestered section, I assume.

Are you any unusual difficulties with either of those agencies in terms of

cooperation as you attempt to get to a public release of what should be

appropriately publicly released?

MR. TUNHEIM: Well, Mr. LaTourette, the answer — the question is, no, we're nöt

receiving any degree of difficulty with those agencies right now. They are

committed to this process. They are supportive of the effort to keep the process

going for one additional year.

The CIA has not appealed decisions that the review board has made. We've got a

good working relationship with the people within that agency who are doing their

work. The FBI appealed a significant number of our decisions, but now all of

those appeals have been withdrawn. And we've got a working relationship with

the FBI that I think has been constructive and professional and is working quite

The FBI initially opposed release of the document that I held up and appealed

the decision because they had contacted, in a general way, the Swiss federal

police and asked whether this record could be released, and the answer was no.

Our follow-up through the ambassador is showing what really this document was

all about, led to some wiser approach to the particular issue. And sometimes it

takes additional work like that to accomplish the release of important

materials.

REP. LATOURETTE: And the last question I would have is Congressman Stokes

expressed the view that perhaps the fine work of this review board - should

another review board setting be required in the future to review another

situation similar to this, that you may be breaking down some of the barriers in

terms of suspicions that the intelligence community may have about do we need

to, you know, stick to the script and have a page that has all black magic

marker on it? Do you find that the lessons learned in this review board will be

instructive to us as we move forward and think of ways of dealing with the

release of documents in the future?

MR. TUNHEIM: I think that's a very good question. And we have found through

this effort, being the first group, an independent group outside of an agency,

to have this degree of control over the declassification process. The process

---

## Page 217

at first was rough and difficult and fraught with suspicion. That has changed.

There's been a sea change as these agencies have realized that release of this

information is not going to harm our national security, that perhaps it's time

simply to trust the American people with access to important information about

their government. And I think everyone has learned important lessons from this

process. It's a process that, while time- consuming, has worked very well for

this set of records.

REP. LATOURETTE: And in that regard and in that vein, have you at the review

board put together sort of an instruction or an operating manual to be left

behind for future such endeavors?

MR. TUNHEIM: Well, we certainly will. We have - virtually all of our work has

been computerized so that we have an extensive record of exactly how we've

approached all these issues. We do intend, in our final report, to make

recommendations on how this effort can be extended in the future to other areas

if the Congress so wishes.

REP. LATOURETTE: Thank you for answering my questions. Thank you for your fine

work. And thank you, Mr. Chairman.

REP.: Thank you. I had a couple of questions. I read your testimony as I was

listening to the other two. I'm sorry I was late. I wanted to ask Mr. Holland;

were there credible historians who at this point were still questioning the

assassination in the Warren Commission and the information that came out before

this commission existed, before these documents came out?

MR. HOLLAND: Basically, most historians have stayed away from it because they

regard it as a tar baby. So there are actually surprisingly few. By

historians, you mean professors at universities. Surprisingly few have written

about it, because they just see it as a morass, and how are you going to

possibly figure out what happened? So my answer would be - and, you know,

credible is in the eye of the beholder.

But there's actually remarkably few, and that's one of my arguments is that you

have to - it is time to insert it back into history. It did happen during the

Cold War, and that exerted a tremendous influence over what the government did.

Right after the assassination, it was a precipitating element of the formation

of the Warren Commission that the Cold War was ongoing, and they worried about

- to be frank, they worried about congressional committees holding hearings and

disclosure of sources and methods, such as the fact that Oswald had gone to

Mexico City and been observed by photographic surveillance, and how was that

going to be handled by a congressional committee? So I do believe it has to be

inserted into historical context. That's probably been the element that's been

missing all this time.

REP.: So you believe one of the elements of this commission is it'll bring out

of pulp - pop culture - pulp culture was a bad choice of words - pop culture

and in more mainstream because more documents are there, less questions. It can

now be analyzed. And also, you seem to hint that we'll gain as much, not

necessarily that there's a lot of new information on the assassination, but that

we're going to learn a lot about how our government worked and a lot of the

interrelationships, and that may be, in fact, more use to the historians than

any questions they had remaining about the assassination.

MR. HOLLAND: I think - my own particular view is that besides, you know, being

an investigation of three crimes - the murder of President Kennedy, the assault

on Governor Connally and the murder of Officer Tippett (sp), and then the murder

of Oswald, so four crimes - the Warren Commission is a fantastic lens to view

the operation of the government circa 1963-64, because they had an overriding

mandate.

But yet they were going up against agencies such as the FBI and CIA with

---

## Page 219

14-00000

entrenched interests, and especially Hoover's FBI was sort of a wonder to

behold. You dealt with it very gingerly. So it's a great — and the FBI had

not been second-guessed since Hoover became director. This was the first time.

And you can't underestimate what that meant in terms of the difficulties it

posed for the commission. Now, I maintain they still came to the right

conclusion, but the fact is that they had a lot of trouble with the FBI.

REP.: One of the questions here is it took so many years to get to this point.

In looking at what future commissions might do, how much of that, do you think,

can be overcome? In other words, how much of this was the Hoover FBI, say, and

how much of this is institutional that in the first 10 years you'd have so many

agents active in the field, ongoing operations, in the first 20 years there's

still some - can we accelerate the process?

What have we learned from this as to — obviously this is one that particularly

anybody in the '60s era was a defining event, so it's an extraordinary

assassination. But what have we learned for investigations in the future? Do

---

## Page 220

PAGE 34

Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

you believe the CIA and FBI will release information sooner? And if so,

presumably they'll still be redacted, which still could lead to Oliver Stone

movies and Lincoln conspiracy books and all sorts of things.

MR. HOLLAND: Mr. Chairman, I think that the fact that these records are 30 years

old has helped in obtaining their release. It's not information about the

assassination per se that agencies have objected to releasing. It's more who

said what to who, who's an intelligence agent and who's an informant for the

FBI, those kinds of issues. And there will still be institutional reluctance to

release any of that information.

I hope that through this process we can demonstrate to the public and to these

agencies that this information can be released to the public, that the public

can be trusted with information like this. There will still be a need for

secrecy to a certain extent, but certainly not with the broad brush/black pen

approach of the past.

REP.: We first learned - I was elected in '94, and our first experience in

this committee was with Waco, where we had similar questions and still had some

information that wasn't able to be released. We're certainly having that

ongoing debate with the administration right now, because it gets far beyond the

initial investigation. In the course of Travelgate we discovered the data bank.

And, of course, with the data bank you discover the code, and then you find out

that the code leads to this. Pretty soon you're off into other investigations.

That's going to be an ongoing problem. Do you believe, in the end, that this

will have silenced most critics?

MR. HOLLAND: In my view, Mr. Chairman, it will silence some. It will perhaps

provoke others.

We're many years after an event that was investigated in a different era. There

were many mistakes made at the time that cannot be corrected at this stage in

time. But I think when the review board is done with its work, one thing we

should be able to prove to the American people is that the federal government is

no longer keeping secrets from them relative to the Kennedy assassination. I

think that will be a very significant development.

Whether all the questions will be resolved or not, that's a question for

historians in the future who will review these materials and will make their

determinations. This is like a gigantic puzzle with a lot of pieces missing.

We are putting some of those pieces in, small pieces and large pieces. But

there's a lot of pieces of the puzzle that will never be found.

REP.: I want to ask one last question, and that's options of dealing with

acquiring the Zapruder film. Is that going to be a cost additional to what

you're requesting? Do you have options on how to pay for that? What's the

---

## Page 221

status of that?

MR. HOLLAND: Well, the Zapruder film, as the chairman is aware, the review board

designated that as an assassination record about a month or so ago. We felt

that that decision was determined by the Congress in the passage of the JFK

Records Collection Act when it said that all records in the possession of the

National Archives are assassination records and should be included in this

collection.

Recognizing the potential cost of a film like this, we did set forth a 16-month

period before the taking would take place, so that the Congress could address

this issue and make appropriate determinations that the Congress wished to make

those determinations. The board did feel that that decision had been made for it

by the Congress in the earlier act and that it is the most significant piece of

evidence of one of the most significant crimes in our nation's history. So,

therefore, the original has an intrinsic value, and it should belong forever to

the American public.

---

## Page 222

PAGE 35

Federal News Service, JUNE 4, 1997

We are hopeful that the Zapruder family will agree eventually to donate that

film to the American public. We have no assurances of that at this point. But

we did set the time frame far out in the future so that the Congress can review

this issue and make its own determinations if it so wishes. REP. : Do you have

any additional questions? With that, I thank you all for -..

REP. LATOURETTE: Mr. Chairman, if I could beg your indulgence and just ask one

more question, if I may.

Mr. Tunheim, if I might, my previous question about difficulty with the CIA and

FBI. Sometimes I don't make things broad enough. And I guess my query would be,

it's been brought to my attention that perhaps there's been some difficulty in

obtaining records from the other body. Is there any agency within the federal

government that you're having difficulty in terms of cooperation that would

impede your ability to complete your work in a timely fashion, as envisioned by

this legislation?

MR. TUNHEIM: Mr. LaTourette, I have not seen any evidence currently that anyone

is deliberately stonewalling us, so that when we go away, they will put the

records back into the files. We had some significant problems early in the

process, just really because agencies didn't understand what this was all about

and didn't understand what the law really provided for. So it took some time.

It's taken some time, for example, with the Secret Service to get them to the

point of realizing their obligations under the act. They do now, and they've

been very cooperative and easy to work with. But this has been a learning

process for all of the agencies, and I feel at the current time there are no

impediments among any of the agency partners that we're dealing with to

completing the review of the records on a timely basis.

REP. LATOURETTE: Thank you. I thank the chair for your indulgence.

REP.: I thank you all for your testimony and appreciate your coming today. For

procedural purposes, I'll now close this hearing - the hearing is adjourned -

and open a subcommittee markup on HR 1553, markup of the John F. Kennedy Record

Review Board Reauthorization Act. The hearing is now open.

If there are no opening statements, the subcommittee will now proceed to the

consideration of the bill as amended. Without objection, the first reading of

the bill is dispensed with and the bill will be considered for amendment at any

point. Do any members wish to be recognized to offer an amendment? Hearing

none, the question is on favorable reporting of the bill, HR 1553, the John F.

Kennedy Assassination Records Review Board Reauthorization Act. All those in

favor say "Aye."

MEMBERS: Aye.

REP.: Opposed, "No." In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. It goes

fast. The question now comes, will the subcommittee report the bill to the full

committee? All those in favor, say "Aye." MEMBERS: Aye.

REP.: Opposed, "No." In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. The bill

moves forward to the full committee. There is no other business before the

subcommittee. We now stand adjourned. Thank you all for your hard work.

Judge John R. Tunheim

Chairman

Assassination Records Review Board

Prepared Testimony In Support of

H.R. 1553,

To amend the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992

to extend the authorization of the Assassination Records Review Board

until September 30, 1998.

Before the

National Security, International Affairs and Criminal Justice Subcommittee,

House Government Reform and Oversight Committee

June 4, 1997

I. Introduction

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, I would like to thank you for the

opportunity to testify on behalf of the Assassination Records Review Board in support

of H.R. 1553, which would extend the authorization of the Review Board for one final

year. The Board acknowledges that all of the issues surrounding the assassination of

President Kennedy will likely never be fully resolved, however, this additional time

will allow us to complete our work, including the review and public release of critical

FBI and CIA records, submit a comprehensive and complete final report to the

Congress and the President, and make available to the American public as much

information as possible on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Chairman Burton for introducing

H.R. 1553, and Congressmen Waxman and Stokes for cosponsoring this bill. These

Members have exhibited an admirable bipartisan spirit and an understanding that we

as a government, and as a nation, must bring closure to a sad chapter of our history, .

and that we must seize this opportunity to do it now. In addition, we would like to

express our appreciation to Chairman Hastert for chairing this hearing today. It

provides an opportunity to explain what the Review Board has accomplished to date

and discuss how we could finish our work in Fiscal Year 1998, if given the opportunity.

Please allow me to introduce the other members of the Review Board with whom I have

had the professional honor and personal pleasure to work: Dr. Henry F. Graff,

Professor Emeritus of History, Columbia University; Dr. Kermit L. Hall, Dean, College

of Humanities, and Professor of History and Law, The Ohio State University; Dr.

William L. Joyce, Associate University Librarian for Rare Books and Special Collections,

Princeton University; and Dr. Anna K. Nelson, Distinguished Adjunct Historian in

Residence, The American University. We have been honored to engage in this

important effort to make the history of the Kennedy assassination available to the

American public and I am pleased to be here today to testify before this Subcommittee

and answer any of your questions.

I would also like to describe briefly the professional staff that we are fortunate to have

hired. The Executive Director is Dr. David G. Marwell, a professional historian who

gained vast experience dealing with large numbers of important historical documents

with the Office of Special Investigations at the Department of Justice and later as the

Director of the Berlin Document Center. He leads a staff of 28 full-time employees, who

have varied backgrounds as historians, lawyers, analysts, investigators, and

administrators. The members of the staff have approached their unique task with

seriousness of purpose, creativity, professionalism, and competence, and have assisted

us in shedding new light on the assassination through the release of thousands of

Federal Government records, and the acquisition of records in private hands and local

governments that were not previously available to the American public. I believe that

we assembled exactly the type of professional and diversified staff that Congress

envisioned would be necessary to accomplish this difficult assignment.

Il. Accomplishments to Date

As I know you are aware, the Review Board was created by The President John F.

Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (FK Act) as an independent

Federal agency to oversee the identification and release of records related to the

assassination of President Kennedy. I know that certain members of this subcommittee

played a role in crafting and passing the JFK Act- a unique piece of legislation

designed to remove doubt and speculation about the content of government records

related to the assassination of President Kennedy. As a result of these lingering

suspicions, Congress determined that an independent board was the most effective and

efficient vehicle to make all assassination records available to the public.

The Review Board has accomplished much since we began releasing previously secret

records in June of 1995. The Board has acted to transfer more than 14,000 documents to

the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection JFK Collection) at the

National Archives and Records Administration. We would not have been successful in

our efforts without the significant assistance of the National Archives. The JFK

Collection currently totals approximately 3.7 million pages and is used extensively by

researchers from all over the United States.

By the end of Fiscal Year 1997, the Review Board will have reviewed and processed

nearly all of the assassination records that have been identified by the more than 30

different government offices believed to be in possession of relevant records, with the

2

---

## Page 226

, important exception of the FBI and the CIA. I will elaborate on the status of records

held by these two agencies later. The overwhelming majority of previously redacted

information will have been made public by the Review Board.

III. Release of Government Records Related to the Assassination

Before discussing what we will accomplish with one final year, I would like to highlight

for the Members of the Subcommittee some of the important records that the Board has

made public. They include:

Thousands of CIA documents on Lee Harvey Oswald and the assassination of

President Kennedy that made up the CIA's Oswald File and detail the agency's

investigative activities following the assassination;

* Thousands of once-secret records from the investigation by the House Select

Committee on Assassinations, chaired by Congressman Stokes, including the un sca:

controversial Staff Report on Oswald's trip to Mexico City;

* Thousands of records from the FBI's core and related assassination files that

document the FBI's interest in Oswald from 1959-63, after he had defected to the

Soviet Union, three years before the assassination; and

* The extensive FBI files on its investigation of the assassination.

The important work in which the Review Board has been engaged can be best and most

graphically demonstrated by showing you the "before" and "after" versions of one of

the pre-assassiration FBI documents to which I just referred and that the Board has

released to the public. Prior to the Review Board's review, this FBI document (FK

Collection Record Number: 124-10023-10236, Attachment Number 1) was available to

the public as you see it on the left. As you can see, it is heavily redacted. The only

information that was not secret was the date of the memorandum, "October 12, 1960,"

that it was to the "Director, FBI," from "Legat, Paris" (the FBI representative in Paris),

that the subject was "Lee Harvey Oswald, Internal Security," and that it had to do with

a "Paris letter 9/27/60." The rest of the text was blacked out. Obviously, this version

of the document left room for a great deal of speculation among historians and

researchers regarding what was underneath the black ink on this document with the

provocative subject title.

The Review Board aggressively pursued the release of the redacted information in this

document and several others that relate to the FBI's interest in Oswald before the

assassination. After protracted negotiations with the FBl, an initial FBl appeal to the

White House in an effort to keep the document secret, and a direct appeal to the Swiss

3

---

## Page 227

14-00000

government, we were able to release the information. The unredacted memorandum

shows that the Swiss Federal Police had been enlisted by the FBI to try to locate Oswald

and to determine whether or not he had enrolled at a school in Switzerland. Now the

public is able to see the document in full and judge its importance. In its redacted state,

the document could have meant anything that a researcher's imagination and

speculation could invent. In its released form, it must be analyzed for what it says.

IV. Identification and Location of Additional Assassination Records

One of the most important, most difficult, and most time-consuming responsibilities of

the Review Board is to identify and locate additional records that are relevant to the

assassination. This is a task that to some degree must logically come later in the

process, after the Review Board has gained a full understanding of the records that have

already been identified. Although the Review Board has made a significant number of

requests for additional records and information, some of which I would like to outline,

much remains to be done before it can be confident that it has completed this "id

responsibility.

I would like to highlight some of our efforts to identify and locate additional

assassination records. Some examples:

Medical Records Inquiry. The Review Board has several ongoing efforts to

identify and locate assassination records involving medical issues. As with any

homicide, the medical records are among the most important pieces of evidence.

As part of its attempt to ensure that the medical records are as complete as

possible, the Review Board staff has deposed the principal pathologists involved

in President Kennedy's autopsy, as well as other individuals who had

knowledge of the autopsy and related photographic records.

Identification and Location of Additional FBI Records and Information. The

Review Board has continued its efforts to locate additional FBI assassination

records by making several requests for records and information. The FBI has

assisted in this effort by giving the Review Board members access to requested

files. The JFK Task: Force at the FBI has, on the whole, been extremely

"you""

cooperative and helpful to the Board and has provided the requested

information.

Identification and Location of Additional CIA Records and Information. The

Review Board has initiated a number of requests to the CIA for additional

information and records. The Review Board expects that these requests will be -

promptly and fully satisfied during the upcoming year.

4

---

## Page 228

Identification and Location of Additional Secret Service Records and

Information. Time consuming and careful review of Secret Service activities by

the Review Board produced a series of requests for additional records and

information that, in turn, led to the identification of additional relevant

assassination records. For example, in response to the Review Board's first eight

requests for additional information, the Secret Service has submitted more than

1,500 pages of material.

*

Identification and Location of Additional Military Records and Information. The

Department of Defense (including its many components and the military

services) (collectively "DOD"), identified few assassination records on its own

initiative. DOD has nevertheless been cooperative with the efforts of the Review

Board to locate assassination records. When such records have been located,

DOD has been willing to release the records with few redactions.

Additional work would be required in our last year to ensure that all"er ensure reac

assassination records in the military archives have been made a part of the JFK med=

Collection. Fortunately, the diligent efforts of the ARRB staff have set the stage

for accomplishing this task.

V. Release of Private and Local Records

In addition to the release of records in the Federal Government's vast files, and

consistent with the Board's mandate to make the historical record of the assassination as

complete as possible, we have been aggressive in identifying and acquiring significant

assassination-related records in the possession of private citizens and local

governments, including:

*

The original personal papers of Warren Commission Chief Counsel J. Lee Rankin

that give further insight into the operations of the Commission;

Copies of the official records of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison's

investigation of the assassination;

The original papers of New Orleans attorney Edward Wegmann, from his work

as a member of the legal team that successfully defended Clay Shaw in 1969

against a charge of conspiracy to kill President Kennedy.

Copies of records from the Metropolitan Crime Commission of New Orleans,

including records on District Attorney Garrison's investigation and prosecution

of Clay Shaw and records regarding New Orleans organized crime figures;

5

---

## Page 229

Long-lost films taken in Dallas on November 22, 1963, that the public had never

seen and that shed new light on the events of that day; and

Private collections of records from individuals including Warren Commission

attorney Wesley Liebler, author David Lifton, FBI Special Agent Hosty, Attorney

Frank Ragano, as well as others.

I am also pleased to announce today that the Review Board has just acquired the

original personal papers of Clay Shaw, the late New Orleans businessman who is the

only person ever tried in connection with the assassination of President Kennedy. Shaw

was acquitted by a jury in 1969 after being charged as part of District Attorney

Garrison's investigation. The Shaw papers will surely add another dimension to this

particular chapter of the assassination story.

All of these records will enrich the historical record of the assassination for future

generations of Americans. Once these records are processed and described by the

National Archives, they will be available for research.

VI. The Need For Additional Time

Despite our best efforts and significant accomplishments, some of which I have

outlined, the Review Board will not be able to complete its work within the original

three-year timetable set by Congress for the following reasons:

First, the authors of the original legislation believed that our task would take

three years. That estimate was based on the best available information at the

time, but the legislation established an unprecedented process. There was no

way of knowing the problems of scale and complexity that the Board would

encounter, nor was there any way to factor in the comprehensive approach we

have taken in fulfilling our mandate.

Second, the Board was not appointed until 18 months after the legislation was

signed into law. As a result, without the guidance of the Board, Federal agencies

initially defined for themselves the universe of records that should be processed

under The Act and to speculate about the kind of evidence that would be needed

to sustain the redaction of assassination-related information. Once the Board

was in place, agencies needed to redo a considerable amount of work. In fact,

many agencies have yet to complete their review and the Board is still seeking

their compliance.

Third, our enabling legislation imposed several restrictions on the manner in

which the Board could operate. Unlike other temporary agencies, the Board

6

---

## Page 230

could not hire or detail experienced federal employees, but rather had to hire

new employees who had to undergo background investigations and be cleared at

the Top Secret level. Locating and renovating space that was suitable for the

storage of classified materials was required. As a result, the Board could not

begin an effective review of records until the third quarter of our first year.

We are pleased and proud that the Review Board and staff have been able to overcome

these obstacles, and that we have developed an efficient and effective process for the

review of records. All involved in this process want to see that the job is done, and do

not want to cease now with a reasonable conclusion in sight. We want to finish the job

we began, and with one additional year we can.

VII. The Job Ahead

The additional year of operations will permit the Review Board to finish its task by

completing several major areas of our work. Please be assured that these are-ve sc

identifiable projects that are critical to ensuring that the JFK Collection is as complete as""enion is ts

possible, that relevant Federal agencies have been held accountable, and that all that we

have done is documented in our final report. The Board would focus in our final year

on the following:

CIA Sequestered Collection. The Review Board has completed its review of the

Oswald "201 file," the file created and maintained by the CIA on Oswald and the

assassination. The Review Board is now faced with the task of reviewing the

agency's "Sequestered Collection," the large collection of files that was

assembled by the CIA in response to requests made by the House Select

Committee on Assassinations, chaired by Congressman Stokes, in the late 1970's.

These records find their relevance to the assassination defined in part by the

course of the HSCA investigation. The Sequestered Collection originally

consisted of 63 boxes of CLA- and HSCA-originated records as well as 72 reels of

microfilm. Unfortunately, these records are in a confused order, poorly

described, and are replete with duplicates. Some of these records are clearly of

great significance, some are of only marginal interest, and the relevance of others

cannot be identified.

FBI Sequestered Collection. The FBI divides its assassination records into two

general categories. The first is the "Core and Related Files," consisting of nearly

600,000 pages of files collected in the course of the massive FBI investigation into

the assassination. The Review Board will complete its review of this significant

collection by the end of FY 1997. The second, which the FBI refers to as its

"HSCA records," is a large collection of records that were identified as being of

interest to the HSCA and which remain to be reviewed by the Board. Like the

7

---

## Page 231

1d-0n0d

CIA's Sequestered Collection, this voluminous body of records (approximately

280,000 pages) ranges widely in relevance to the assassination.

The Records of Some Federal Agencies and Congressional Committees.

Additional time will allow the Board to finish its work with several agencies,

including the Secret Service, the National Security Agency, and Congressional

Committees, including the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Search for Additional Records. With one more year of operations, the Board's

search for additional records held by Federal agencies, private individuals, and

local governments would be concluded with greater confidence. Some of these

records have been identified, but not yet acquired by the Board.

Federal Agency Compliance. In November 1996, the Review Board initiated a

compliance program to ensure that Federal agencies have fully cooperated with

the Board in discharging its responsibility of assuring Congress and the

-=091"".

American public that the goals of the JFK Act have been accomplished to the been accomplise

greatest possible extent. The requests to document compliance with the JFK Act

were sent to 27 U.S. government agencies and departments to confirm that the

U.S. government has identified, located, and released all records relating to the

assassination of President Kennedy. The agencies' statements of compliance will

be included in the Review Board's final report to the Congress. The one-year

extension will ensure that the compliance program is completed and fully

documented in the final report.

It is important for the Review Board to complete these major projects. The Board

believes that the completion of the task outlined above, the inclusion of these important

records in the JFK Collection, and the documentation of Federal agency compliance as

part of the final report will mark an appropriate point at which to conclude the Board's

work. We are confident that all that remains for the Board can be accomplished in an

additional year.

VIII. An Approach to the Review of the Remaining CIA and FBI Records

It is clear to the members of the Review Board that there is much work to be done. The

review of the remaining CIA and FBI records is a cumbersome and complicated täsk.

However, the Board and staff have the benefit of our experience to date that sets the

stage for an efficient and effective review of the remaining records. I would like to

briefly describe our early experiences reviewing records and how the past two years set

a firm foundation for the future and would work to our advantage in our last year.

8

---

## Page 232

14-00000

Our review of records in the early months was slowed by the complexities of the issues

raised in the records. The unprecedented new standards of the JFK Act, which go far

beyond those established under the Freedom of Information Act, required a time-

consuming early phase.

At first, the review process proceeded slowly and the agencies were afforded ample

opportunity to present their evidence. Over time, the Review Board began to

standardize its interpretation of the relevant section of the JFK Act and the issues raised

in the various documents. Now that the Review Board and the agencies are familiar

with the rigorous demands of the JFK Act, the process has accelerated. In a

progressively increasing number of cases, records that initially contained proposed

postponements can be released through a "consent" process. In this consent process,

the ARRB staff notifies an agency that its proposed postponements are not likely to be

approved by the Review Board and the agency thereupon voluntarily consents to the

release of the information.

In our review of the FBI's "Core and Related Files" and the CLA's "Oswald 201 File," "!. C: =*:

the records that have been the focus of our attention to date, we subjected every

requested redaction to a rigorous test: did the evidence of the harm that would result

from the release of the information outweigh the public interest in the information?

In considering our review of the CIA and FBI "Sequestered Collections," the Board

recognized that it needed to develop a different approach, one that would take into

account the varied degree of relevance of individual records to the assassination. Only

in this way could the Board ensure that it would appropriately expend its resources in

its last year. As a first step, the Board carefully analyzed each collection in order to

determine what priority should be assigned to the category of records. In addition, the

Board developed a set of guidelines for the review of these records which recognized

that some categories of records did not require the intensive word-by-word review that

had been the rule for the core collections that have been the subject of the Board's

attention to date. The development of these guidelines began with the August 6, 1996

Board public hearing and culminated in their adoption at the October 16, 1996 Board

meeting. The ARRB staff will distinguish between records whose relevance to the

assassination is clear and those not believed to be relevant (or "NBR"). Applying these

new standards will permit the ARRB staff to identify and review the most significant

remaining records in order of priority.

These detailed guidelines will reduce the loss of valuable Review Board and ARRB staff

time expended to review, on a word-by-word basis, those documents that have a

remote relationship, at best, to the Kennedy assassination. Those documents that are

identified as relevant to the assassination will continue to be reviewed word-by-word.

These standards of relevance are designed to ensure that the greatest number of true

assassination records is properly identified, reviewed, and made public in the JFK

Collection at the National Archives.

The fruits of our labor from the first three years would be realized in our last year, one

in which we would be reviewing some of the most difficult records, and potentially

most important records, but with the benefit of our invaluable experience. Iam happy

to report that we have received assurances from the FBI and CIA that they will work

with us in a final year to make sure that the necessary resources are applied so that our

task can be completed.

IX. Conclusion

In making our recommendation for a one-year extension, we, the members of the

Review Board, are fully cognizant of the difficulties inherent in extending a temporary

commission. We are aware of the concern that temporary bodies may have a self-

preserving and self-perpetuating instinct, and want to assure you in the clearest and

::=.:."

most unambiguous manner that our recommendation is motivated strictly by our desire

to complete the job. My colleagues and I were appointed as private citizens and have

many competing claims on our time and energy. It is our collective conviction that the

additional time is necessary and our sincerest commitment that we will complete our

task by the end of Fiscal Year 1998, if given the means.

I would like to note that, as you may be aware, the Administration is supportive of the

one-year extension for the Review Board and has submitted an FY 1998 budget

amendment to allow us to complete our work, close out our operation, and submit our

final report.

Since the Review Board began this effort three years ago, we have witnessed the

widespread and passionate interest that the American public has in the assassination of

President Kennedy. We have received thousands of letters, telephone calls, faxes and

e-mail messages from individuals who care deeply about our history. They come from

all walks of life, from all over the country, and are of all ages. Their interest is of

varying degrees and they do not all agree on what happened in Dallas on November 22,

1963. However, they do agree that the public has the right to see the files on the

assassination.

I believe that what the Review Board is all about can be summed up in a letter we

received from a man from California just last week. The author is not a professional

historian, not a student working on a paper for a history class, but simply a private

citizen interested in learning about this tragic historical event. He wrote the following:

"In my humble opinion, it appears that the ARRB is having a healing effect

10

## Page 234

14-00000

upon the American public, who may be coming to realize that there may be

closure in sight (in our lifetimes) with regard to the JFK assassination."

These words capture why the Review Board was created by the Congress and why we

hope that the Review Board will have the additional year to complete our task.

The Assassination Records Review Board was conceived as a means of eliminating

uncertainty and speculation about the contents of government files relating to the

assassination of President Kennedy. We, the members of the Board, believe that a

premature termination of the Review Board would surely generate intensified doubts

within the general public about the commitment of Congress to release all information

that relates to the assassination of President Kennedy, as well as renewed speculation

about the conduct of our government and its institutions and personnel. If appropriate

closure is not reached now, the identical issues will likely have to be addressed again in

the future at even greater cost. The additional year that we recommend will allow, for

a confident conclusion of this important task. eur oret tarpostarte

Mr. Chairman, and Members of the Subcommittee, on behalf of the members of the

Assassination Records Review Board, I thank you for allowing us this opportunity t

discuss our work and our future. We urge you to favorably report H.R. 1553. I woul

be happy to answer any questions that the members of the Subcommittee may have for

me. The Board and staff stand ready to provide the Subcommittee with any additional

information that may be required. Thank you.

(a) FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONE.-The Congress finds and

clares that

(1)

---

## Page 238

(1) all Government records related to the assaination of

President John F. Kennedy should be preserved for historical

and governmental purposes;

(2) all government records concerning the assassination of

President John F. Kennedy should carry a presumption of im-

mediate disclosure, and all records should be eventually dis

closed to enable the public to become fully informed about the

history surrounding the assassination;

(3) legialation is necessary to create an enforceable, inde-

pendent, and accountable process for the public disclosure of

such records;

(4) legislation is necessary because congrestional records re-

lated to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy would

not otherwise be subject to public disclosure until at least the

year 2029;

(0) legislation is necessary because the Freedom of Informa.

tion Act, as implemented by the executive branch, has prevent

ed the timely public disclosure of records relating to the assas

sination of President John F. Kennedy;

legislation

is

nECessary

because Executive Order No.

12356, entitled "National Security Information" has eliminated

the declassification and downgrading schedules relating to clas-

sified information across government and has prevented the

timely public disclosure of records relating to the assassination

of President John F. Kennedy; and

(7) most of the records related to the assassination of Presi-

lent John F. Kennedy are almost 30 years old, and only in the

rarest cases is there any legitimate need for continued protec

tion of such records.

(b) PURPOsES. - The purposes of this Act are

(1) to provide for the creation of the President John F. Ken-

nedy Assassination Records

Collection at the National Ar-

chives and Records Administration; and

(2) to require the expeditious public transmission to the Ar-

chivist and public disclosure of such records.

observations, judgments, and determinations with regard to the

history of the assassination and related matters. In order to pro-

vide for the most comprehensive disclosure of records related to the

assassination of President Kennedy,

the Act empowers an inde-

pendent review board with the authority to request any additional

information or records from relevant government agencies and con-

gressional committees. Finally, the determinations of the review

board are reviewable and enforceable in a court of law

These purposes and objectives were carefully addressed durine

the development of the new legislation. The

President John

Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act" ("the Act") reflects

he many recommendations. and ideas developed from the hearing

meetings with affected

government agencies,

nd views expresse

y members of the public experienced

in efforts to access records

from relevant agencies in

general, and with particular emphasis

upon the assassination of President Kennedy. The bill also reflecte

the considerable

research and expertise of the Committee staff

with regard to the law and policy of public access to government

information.

The legislation establishes the President John F. Kennedy Assas

sination Records Collection at the National Archives.

The Collec-

ion will be made known and accessible to the public by the cre

ation of a subject guidebook and index to the records created by the

National Archives. The Collection will include all publicly avail-

able assassination records at the National Archives at the time of

enactment (eg. public records of the Warren Commission): all as

sassination records released by rovernment offices pursuant to the

Act; all postponed records as part of the "protected" Collection;

and all postponed records as they become publicly disclosed in the

future.

The public will also be able to request reproduction o

records from originating government agencies.

Government offices holding assassination records are required to

begin orranizing and reviewing such records upon enactment and

have this work completed within ten months of enactment. During

this time, the government offices will determine whether records

qualify as

"assasgination records" and then whether they recom-

mend to the Review Board that public disclosure of certain records

be postponed for reasons of national security, confidentiality,

and

privacy, as established in the Act. All assassination records which

are not recommended for postponement must be made immediately

available to the public through the government office and by trans-

mission to the National Archives.

scords recommended for post

ponement are required to be reviewed by an independent Assassi-

nation Records Review Board: which makes determinations for re-

lease or postponement.

In the case of executive branch records and information,

the

president has the authorite to override the Review Board's deter-

minations with regard to release or postponement. For congression-

al records, in the event that the Congress disagrees with a determi-

nation by the

Review Board, each

House would be required to

IV. BACKGROUND AND NERD FOR LEGIBLATION

On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assas

nated. It was a tragic and defining moment in American histo

The desire by the American public to understand who assassinat

President Kennedy, and why, has resulted in several official inv

tigations and a broad spectrum of private inquiries and schol.

Unfortunately, in the eyes of the public, each investigati

and inguiry served to raise additional questions and did so wh

increasing the volume of secret government records about the

sassination. In 1992,

records were H.R. 4090, introduced January 3, 1992, and H.R. 4108,

introduced January 24, 1992. Two House resolutions directing the

unsealing of the records of the Select Committee on Assassinations

were H. Res. 325, introduced January 22, 1992, and H. Res. 326, in-

troduced January 24, 1992.

The Committee shares the belief in the importance of disclosing

the records. It believes that all government records related to the

assassination of President Kennedy should be preserved for histori-

cal and governmental purposes; that all such records should carry

a presumption of immediate disclosure; and that all such records

should be eventually disclosed to enable the public to become fully

informed about the history surrounding the assassination.

The Committee also closely examined the issue of whether legis-

lation was recessary and concluded that it was. While disclosure of

the records could be achieved through a non-statutory approach

by each House of the Congress passing a resolution pertaining to

its records, and the President issuing an executive order to the

same effect a statute is necessary to ensure an independent and

enforceable mechanism for disclosure under uniform standards for

review.

In addition, the Committee found that legislation is necessary be

cause congressional records related to the assassination would not

otherwise be subject to public disclosure until at least the year

2029 (with

uncertain disclosure of related classified executive

branch records); because the Freedom of Information Act, as imple

mented by the Executive Branch, has impeded the timely public

disclosure of the assassination records: because Executive Order

12356. "National Security Information," has eliminated the govern-

ment wide schedules for declassification and downgrading of classi-

fied information and has prevented the timely public disclosure of

assassination records; and because most of the records related to

the assagination of President Kennedy are at least 30 years old

and only in the rarest cases is there any legitimate need for contin-

ued protection of such records.

The release of records and materials in the possession of the fed-

eral government pursuant to the legislation will significantly expe

dite public access to this information. Although certain records re

lated to the assassination of President Kennedy have been made

available over time to the public, the legialation will create oppor-

tunities for the public to review records which might otherwise not

be possible for several decades. Importantly, the public will be en-

abled to make their own observations and judgments based on first-

hand aocess to previously undisclosed records.

In addition to the above discussion, the Appendix of this report

contains a thorough description and summary of the records of the

presidential commissions and congressional committees which in-

vestigated the assassination of President Kennedy.

V. MAJOR PROVISIONS

The requirements of the "President John F. Kennedy Assassina-

tion Records Collection Act®

are written in a detailed manner to

ensure that its implementation is effective and efficient. In addi-

21

tion, it is important to emphasize and clarify the legislative intent

and importance of particular provisions of the Act.

Board undertakes

ities. Such guidance will be valuable notwithstanding the fact that

government offices will begin to organize and review their record:

before the Review Board is established. Government offices are re

quired to begin the review and disclosure of records upon enact

ment to expedite public access to the many records which do not

require additional review or postponement. However, the ultimat

work of the Review Board will involve not only the review o

records recommended for postponement, but requiring government

inces to provide additional information and records, where appr

riate. Guidance, especially that developed in consultation with ti

public, scholars, and affected government offices, will prove valua

ble to ensure the fullest possible disclosure and create public confi

dence in a workins definition that was developed in an indenend

ent and open manner.

Autopsy Records

The Act specifically

excludes from the definition of "assassi

nation records"

the autopsy records and copies or reproductions

made from such records donated by the Kennedy family pursuant

to a deed of gift executed on October 29, 1966. These records in

clude the autopsy photographs and X-rays of President Kennedy

The Committee believes that this exclusion is a sound policy. Thi

Committee believes that there is a compelling justification for pro

tecting the privacy of the Kennedy family from the unwarrante

intrusion that would be raised by public disclosure of the autopsy

records conveyed by the deed.

The Committee has carefully examined the deed of gift, which is

operative throughout the lifetime of the survivors of the late Presi-

dent Kennedy. The deed in no way restricts access to official gov.

ernment investigators concerned with the assassination. Other

members of the public may obtain access to the autopsy: photo

graphs and X-rays only with the express written permission of the

Kennedy family

or their legal

representative.

The

Committee

found that since the time of the donation, that public access has

besie ant mike us l the record a the been stant galiles to

the records. It is believed that this practice can and should contin-

ue as set forth by the terms of the deed and will rightfully balance

the needs for access by professionals with the privacy protection in-

tended by the terms of the deed.

Lastly, the provision also serves to restore to the original autopey

records donated by the Kennedy family to the National Archives

any reproductions or copies of such records. This provision specifi-

cally governs all reproductions or copies made by official investiga-

tive committees or for other purposes, including those created by or

for the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). During

autopsy photozraphs and X-rays which were duplicated from the

original records conveyed by the Kennedy deed. This is true despite

a clear and documented understanding between the attorney for

the Kennedy family and the National Archives, set forth in an

August 15, 1977, memorandum by the National Archives general

counsel.

This memorandum

required that all reproductions

or

copies of the autopsy records be returned to the original collection.

It is intended that the Kennedy autopsy records contained in the

HSCA records should be restored to the original collection of such

records in the National Archives and treated as Kennedy autopsy

records which are exempt from disclosure under the Act.

The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection

and the National Archives and Records Administration

The legislation is designed and retitled to achieve the single most

important purpose of the Act: public access to the assassination

records. The records related to the assassination of President John

F. Kennedy are the most publicly sought-after, unreleased records

of our

government. It is necessary to ensure that our nation's

public access laws apply in full to these records. In Section 4, the

Act requires the Archivist to establish the President John F. Ken-

nedy

Assassination Records Collection at the National Archives

and Records Administration (National Archives]. Furthermore, the

Archivist, the National Archives, and presidential libraries have

specific responsibilities with regard to public access and disclosure,

as well as for providing guidance to government offices whose

records are the subject of the Act.

23

Subject Guidebook and Inder

Section 4(a) requires that the Archivist create a subject guid

book and index so that the public may identify and make request

for assassination records in the Collection. It is intended that th

ruidebook and index, or parts thereof, be made publicly availabl

on a cumulative basis. In addition, it is intended that the Archivi

insure that copies of the completed guidebook and index are di

tributed nationally to ensure access to the

Collection through r

quests for reproduction of documents.

examined this concern by investigating the cost of obtaining

copies of records at the National Archives and at agencies includ

ing the CIA and the FBI. The Committee specifically sought to de-

termine the cost of reproduction of records which are

"on the

shelf"' and for which no search is required.

The Committe on the shel?"

confirmed that it is more expensive for the

records at the National Archives

than at originating agencies.

This is the result to two factors: Pric-

ing policy and application of the fee waiver provisions of the Free

dom of Information Act (FOLA). The Nationa

Archives charges the

public a higher price for reproduction and does not honor the fee

vaiver provisions of the FOIA in the belief that it is exempt from

such provisions.

The Committee determined that the pricing policy of the

CLA

and the FBI are identical. Where no search is required, the first

one-hundred pages are free, and additional copies cost ten cents per

the agency or

mail. In comparison,

harges the public ten cents per page for copies of recorde which

and twenty-five cents per page for copie

of records requiring mailing. The result has been that the National

Archives has created a burden on the public to shop around gov.

ernment for the least

(h) that the

The Committee next determined that it is less expensive for the

public to obtain copies of records at originating agencies than at

the National Archives because the agencies fee waiver provisions of

the FOLA. Again; the Committee was especially concerned with the

history of access to "on the shelf" records related to the assassina

ion of President Kennedy. The Committee examined the Nationa

rchives claim that it is exempt from such provisions of the FOLA

he influence that this interpretation has had on the cost of recordi

o the public, and the impact of such a policy on uniform and res

sonable access and public disclosure costs under this Act.

The Committee determined that application of the FOLA fee

waiver provisions are particularly

sential with regard to t

cords related to the assassination of President John F. Kennec

First, the National Archives is covered by the Freedom of Informa

Senator Glenn. The results confirmed the concerns of governn

agencies. For the five year period between August 1987 and Me

1992, Mr. Steven Garfinkel, Director of ISOO, identified 35 vi

tions of improper disclosure and handling of classified informat

by the National Archives at 10 different facilities including

Main Archives Building. Mr. Garfinkel stated that the Natio

commingling of classified and unclassified records. and other

tors is the security problems at the National Archives.

The requirement in the Act for consultation between ISOO

the National Archives is essential to the Archives fulfilling the

sponsibilities in the Act for archiving and protecting postpo

records. Failure in developing and properly implementing the

ommendations of ISOO, and addressing concerns of affected a

sies, will prevent the transmission of postponed records to the

tional Archives.

Publications and Reprints of Documents

The original legislation gave the Archivist the authority to iden-

tify records for reproduction and sale by the Government Printing

Office. The substitute approved by the Senate Committee on Gov-

ernmental Affairs does not include this provision. First, it is be-

lieved that by requiring the Archivist to complete a subject guide-

book and index to the Collection, the public will be best served by

aving this detailed document-by document guide. It is expecte

hat this guidebook and index will be nationally distributed anc

provide the public

with the best access to particular records.

Second, estimates of the volume of records in the Collection will

exceed one

million pages, and it is unlikely that the Archivist

would consider it feasible to seek multiple reproductions of bound

volumes containing all the documents ultimately released. Third,

the Act serves to facilitate public disclosure, not to interpret, edit,

or evaluate relevant records. To do otherwise would effectively au-

thorize an official government editor, deciding for the American

public which documents are

"important" and once again interpos

ing the government between the assassination of President Kenne

dy and the American public. The Archivist retains existing author-

ity to making records available for

reprinting, and sale by the

Public Printer, but such action should be undertaken with the afore

stated considerations in mind.

Presidential Libraries

In Section 2, the Act includes presidential libraries within the

definition of the National Archives, and in Section 5(C)(8) it specifi-

cally requires the directors of presidential libraries to expedite the

review of all assassination records and make them available to the

Review Board as required by this Act. It is incumbent on the

dential libraries to determine which of its records man que presi

"assassination records", regardless of whether the

records were

conveyed to the government by a deed or gift or donation, and

where appropriate, be reviewed under the standards for postpone-

ment of the Act. not the more restrictive standards of the Freedom

of Information Act or an executive order on information classifica-

tion.

This provision reflects the existence of relevant records at presi-

dential

libraries,

particularly, though not exclusively to include,

the Lyndon B. Johnson Presideritial Library in Austin, Texas.

the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library in Ann Arbor, Michigan

Each of these presidential libraries received pertinent records by

clusion in the Collection as set forth by this Act

In development of the lerislation, the Committee contacted the

Ford and Johnson presidential libraries with regard to the public

availability of its holdings. In the case of the Lyndon B. Johnson

Presidential Library, the particular provision requiring expedited

review, availability to the Review Board, and public disclosure ver

developed in consultation with its Director.

27

For the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library, this provisis

requires the expedited review,

and public disclosure of all assassination records, and in particul;

Johnson, and were donated to

the library by his former persor

assistant. Mildred Stegall in 1973.

For the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library, this provision i

quires the expedited review, availability to the Review Board, a

public disclosure of all assassination records, and in particular ti

records of the Rockefeller Commission related to the investigatic

of the assassination.

Standards for postponement

Section 6 establishes the grounds for postponement of public d

losure of assassination records. It is important to emphasize th

the Act. Any

Intelligence Agents, Sources, or Methods

Section 6(1XA) permits postponement if the disclosure wouk

"to conces ore the bread in of the provision have per

aised by representatives of government agencies and experience

searchers, and have been considered in development of the prov

sion.

Intelligence Agents

One of the earliest concerns was whether the identity of a de

ceased

intelligence

agent

could

be

postponed.

The government

stressed that at times this might be

necessary if the disclosure

would create a risk of phynical harm to surviving family members,

especially if any of the survivors are currently employees of a U.S.

ntelligence organization. In addition, the government stressed tha

he fact of someone's employment with a U.S. intelligence or cour

terintelligence organization may have been a secret that requires

continued

protection.

This is related to an additional concere quires

the definition of an "intelligence agent." The government believes

---

## Page 251

28

that it is a term of art and that it should extend to a "domestic or

foreign intelligence or counterintelligence asset,

collaborator, for

eign liaison contact, or covert employee of a United States intelli-

gence organization, where the identity of any of these currently re-

quire protection.

From the perspective of some experienced researchers concern-

ing the assassination of President Kennedy, the term

"intelligence

agent" should not apply to deceased agents. They believe that the

of records related to such individuals are at least thirty

The Committee decided that the Review Board should make its

own determinations, and in so doing should consult with the affect

ed arencies, as well as be receptive to the views of the public.

In

determining whether or not the identity of a deceased agent should

be disclosed, the Review Board may wish to consider the impact on

survivors as a legitimate question, but the Review Board should

satisfy itself as to the basis and need for such an assertion as

grounds for postponement. The question of the breadth of the term

raises a different set of questions. Potentially,

the coverare of all individuals employed in an intelligence or coun-

terintelligence capacity by the united States could become extreme

y wideranging and serve to defeat the presumption of disclosure

and purpose of the Act. The Committee hesitates to adopt such a

broad definition of "intelligence agent." However, when the Review

Board is required to

make determinations about the identities of

"intelligence agents" it should consider the breadth of responsibil-

ities and assignments which might fall into this category. Again,

the Review Board should satisfy itself as to the basis and need for

such an assertion as grounds for postponement.

Intelligence Sources and Methods

Section 6(1)(B) permits postponement of an "Intelligence source

r method which is currently utilized, or reasonable expected to be

utilized." Some researchers experienced in the difficulty of accees

ing records related to the assassination of President Kennedy have

raised concerns over the scope of this provision because in the past

"intelligence sources" have included newspapers and libraries, and

because

"intellirence methods" have included photography and lig.

tening devices on telephones: The Review Board should consider a

ligence

sources and methods, including

of the record

whether the use of a particular source or method is already well

known by the public (e.g. that the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City

was burred during the alleged visit of Lee Harvey Orwald),

and

whether the source or method is inherently secret, or whether it

was the information it collected which was secret.

Understanding of Confidentiality

"Section 6(4) permits postponement if disclosure would "compro

mise the existence of an understanding of confidentiality currently

requiring protection between a Government agent and a cooperat

ing individual or forein government, and public disclosure would

he so harmfnl that it outweirhs the public interest." The govern-

ment has arrued that all such confidentiality requires withholding

In applying this postponement standard the Review Board shoul

consider:. Whetker there is an express written confidentiality agree

ment, whether that agreement is express or implied, whether it i

written or unwritten,

the exact restrictions regarding th

cope and duration of confidentiality, whether the agreement cu

ently requires protection; whether a witness or informant or conf

dential source is deceased; and whether the government is seeking

postponement purely because it believes all such records should bi

withheld, or because of the informant's express desire that the un

derstanding not be made public.

In all cases where the Revier

doing, the Review Board should relense as much information fron

the records as is posmible.

Priority of reviewing existing Freedom of Information Act request:

Section 5(2)(bG) requires that government offices give priority t

he identification, review, and trangmission, under the standar

for postponement set forth in this Act, of assassination records that

on

the date of enactment of this Act are the subject of litigatior

under the Freedom of Information Act. This provision is intendec

to stop the continued expenditures by the government and private

individuals related to litisation over records which will be specifi

cally subject to the Act, and reviewed under different, and in most

cases more liberal disclosure standards.

An effort to disclose the

pertinent records to these requestors will assist in responding t

those who have sourht access to the assasrination records over the

longert period of time. A continued delay in release of such record:

will

only

serve to undermine confidence by those members of the

public whose past intereet resulted in the Freedom of Information

Act litigation.

It is intended that the government offices identify

and begin review of such records as a priority upon enactment of

the legislation.

The Committee carefully reviewed the use of this provision for

the creation of the Review Board. The Committee determined that

while this approach could possibly enhance the independence of the

Review

Board and the public confidence in the process, several

other factors mitigated

against this approach.

The Committe

found that the added responsibilities for the Review Board would

divest the Court's resources and time from its primary responsibil-

ities under the Independent Counsel law. The Committee was also

concerned that the judicial panel lacked the experience and exper-

tise to select individuals who are nationally recognized profession-

als in the fields of history, archiving, and public access to informa-

tion.

With these concerns in mind, the Committee chose an alterna-

tive approach to the appointment process while giving significant

weight

to the need for independence, public confidence, and ac-

countability

Section 7

establishes the Assassination Records Review Board.

The

Review

Board will stand as the symbol and barometer

public confidence in the review and release of the government's

records related to the assassination of President Kennedy. The in-

dependence of the Review Board will be rightfully judged by the

public at its inception. The President is given the authority to ap

point the members of the Review Board. Several provisions are in-

ended to provide as much independence and accountability as is

possible within our constitutional framework. These include the re-

gunate, that the the identer be confirmed by the United States

Limitations of presidential postponement

Section 9(d)(1) recognizes the President's authority to override

the determinations of the Review Board; however, the provision ex-

pressly limits such authority to an assassination record or "infor.

mation contained in an assassination

record, obtained or developed

solely within the executive branch." This prohibition is intended

specifically. to restrict the President from having any control or au-

thority over legislative branch records or information. For exam-

ple, within the files of the House Select Committee on Assassina-

tions (HSCA) there are staff notes rely in part on information oh

tained or developed by the CIA. Under the

"third agency" rule ir

the Act, the CIA could choose to recommend that the Review Board

postpone those portions which it identifies as originating at the

CIA.

If the Review Board declined the recommendation and the

President sought

to override

the determination, the

President

would be limited to postpone. those sentences or words which were

originated or developed by the CIA. The remainder of the docu-

ment would have to be publicly disclosed.

Rules of construction

Deeds of Gift. Section 11(a) addresses the need to abide by the

terms of deeds of gift and donation of records to the federal govern-

ment.

With the exception of the autopsy records which are ex-

cluded from the Act, this provision does not intend to exclude other

donated records from the scope of assassination records, and all

such records made publicly available are to be included in the Col

done under the new standards of this Act, and not the more restric-

tive standards of the Freedom of Information Act and the executive

order on security classified information.

and private citizens to

government institutions including the Li

brary of Congress,

the National Archives, and the presidential li

struments of as many of the gifts and donations as possible, and

worked directly with the affected institutions to determine the

• extent to which such records had been made public or could be

made public. When necessary, the Committee requested that the

individual, persons, or entities in controlling access to such records

make them publicly available.

While many of the records were donated by former Presidents or

their families, allowable in part because the Presidential Records

Act did not exist until the presidency of Ronald Reagan, certain

other individuals have also donated records. The personal papers of

ormer Representative Hale Boggs, a Warren Commission member

were donated to the National Archives by his widow the former

lepresentative Lindy Boggs. In another case, the personal paper

ensuring openness and accountability, including the Freedom of In-

ormation Act and judicial review. Such laws, as well as the Gov.

ernment in the Sunshine Act, offer

adequate protections in the

events that meetings need to be closed for reasons of national secu-

rity, as well as other reasons including personal privacy. However,

such exemptions require public notice and this is entirely consist

nt with the extra

level of sensitivity to the accountablit

and

redibility of the Review Board. The applicable laws in Title 5 have

been restored to the Act, as has judicial review.

Existing Authority

Section 11(d) provides that nothing in the Act revoltes or limits

he existing authority of the President. any executive arency.

the

Senate, or the House of Representatives, or any other entity of the

Government to publicly disclose recorde in its possession. This pro-

vision is intended to. make clear that, although the entities of the

Government are required to disclose all assassination records are

not covered by the standards for postponement in Section 6, they

are not required to withhold or postpone disclosure of assassination

records simply because those records are covered by these stand-

ards. If an agency or congressional committee has other statutory

or inherent authority to release a record, it may do so even though

the record would be qualified for postponement for disclosure

under the Act. Thus, with respect to the assassination records, the

Act sets a floor, but not a ceiling, as to what is to be disclosed. At

the same time, nothing in the Act alters any existing righte or

duties with respect to public disclosure of materials that are not as-

sassination records.

Sec. 4. President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection

at the National Archives and Records Administration.

The law provides generally that, not later than 60 days after the

late of its enactment the National Archives and Records Adminis-

tration must begin establishing a collection of records to be known

as the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collec-

tion. In so doing, the Archivist ensures the physical integrity and

original provenance of all collection records. The Collection consists

of copies of all Government records relating to the assassination of

President Kennedy,

determination concerning the public disclosure or postponement of

disclosure of an executive branch assassination record or informa-

tion within such a record, or of any information contained in a as-

tive branch, the President has the sole and nondelegable authority

to require the disclosure or postponement of such record or infor

mation under the standards set forth in section 6,

and the Presi-

dent must provide the Review Board with an unclassified written

certification specifying his decision within 30 days after the Review

Section 10 provides guidance regarding the release of assassir

It may request the Attorney General to petition any court in t

United States or abroad to release any information relevant to t

assassination of President Kennedy that is held under seal of t

court. The Review Board also may request the Attorney General

petition any court in the United States to release any informati

relevant to the assassination of President Kennedy that is he

under the injunction of secrecy of a grand jury. The section in

cates, in this instance, that a request for disclosure of assassinati

materials under the law shall be deemed to constitute a showing

particularized need under Rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Crimit

Procedure.

In addition, three sense of the Congress provisions specify th

(1) the Attorney General should assist

Committee on Governmental Affairs on June 25, 1992. We estimate

that implementing this resolution would cost the federal govern-

ment about $4.5 million a year from 1993 through 1995, assuming

appropriation of the necessary. funde.

This resolution would not

affect direct spending or receipts. Therefore, pay-as-you-go proce-

dures would not apply,

S. 3006 would create, as an independent agency, the Assassina-

tion Records Review Board to consist of five members appointed by

the President. After federal agencies have had 300 days to release

to

the National Archives any unedited assassination records for

public inspection, the board would have the authority to examine

any remaining recorde held by a federal agency or by the Congreas

that the board determines are related to the assassination of Presi-

dent Kennedy. The board would then decide whether the records

should be transferred to the National Archives to be available to

the public or whether public release should be postponed for na-

tional security or privacy reasons. Depending on the source of the

records, the House, the Senate, or the President would be able to

postpone the availability of records that the board considers appro

priate to make public.

The board would be able to hire an Execu-

tive Director and additional personnel as needed. It would have

two years to complete its work, but would be authorized to contin-

ue for a third year before it would terminate.

CBO expects that the board would use all three years allowed to

conduct its review. The

primary expense stemming from

this

view would be the cort of emplovees hired by the board and thos

at several federal agencies which would have to read through the 1

illion or so pages of documents relating to President Kennedy

sassination that are still not released. Based on information fro

the National Archives and other affected agencies about the likely

process and timing for reviewing the records, we estimate that it

would take about 40 employees at federal agencies to conduct the

initial review of records in the allotted 300 days, at a cost of about

$2 million in fiscal year 1993. We estimate that the board would

need a staff of up to 35 employees to review all the records within

the required three-year period, at a cost of about $1.8 million annu-

ally.

In addition, agencies that currently hold the records would

need to assign staff to conduct a parallel review so that the Presi-

dent can decide whether to postpone the release of records that the

board decides should be released. Such a parallel review could re

quire the equivalent of up to 35 employees, representing about $1.8

million in annual staff resources.

The review board itself would require additional appropriations

. of about $0.6 million annually for the director, a counsel, support

staff. overhead, and the cost of board meetings. In addition, the Na-

lonal Archives, which eventually would receive all the releasabl

• records into a President John

. Kennedy Assassination Record

Collection, would spend about $0.6 million over the next three

years to compile a subject guide index to the records in the collec-

tion to assist the public in locating records.

Commission recorde first met to review agency records, and estab

lish a schedule for future review. At that time 80% of all material

was released. Future review was conducted in 1970, 1975, and other

reviews are scheduled to occur in 1995 and every ten years thereaf-

ter. Approximately 98% of all records have now been made public-

ly available.

The remaining 2% constitutes approximately 3,000

pages of security classified and privacy protected documents.

The

.995 review has been now scheduled to take place in 1992, and the

National Archives expects the number of withheld materials to be

reduced to 500 pages. In addition to the Warren Commission

records, the National Archives maintains Secret Service files with

12-15 boxes, mostly paper documents, a copy of the Zapruder film,

and radio tapes of reports of the assassination. The Archives also

has certain records of the Department of Justice Criminal Division

case file which is predominantly mail and letters received by the

Department along with constitutent letters referred to the Depart

ment by Members of Congress.

Lastly,

the Ford Freaidential Li-

brary has documente from the Military District of Columbia with

regard to funeral arrangements for President Kennedy.

vestigation pursued three primary. lines of inquiry related to the

assassination. These included: (1) Whether "E. Howard Hunt and

Frank Sturgis, on behalf of the CIA, personally participated in the

assassination.

(2) Whether "the CIA had connections with Lee

Harvey Oswald or Jack Ruby, or both of them, and that those con-

nections somehow led to the assassination.

" (3) Whether President

Kennedy was struck in the head by a bullet from his right front,

rather than from his rear as believed by the Warren Commission.

The Commission's conclusion in each of these inquiries was in the

negative.&

The Commission held weekly hearings during its six month exist

ence, however, the Commission chose not to open its sessions to the

public for reasons of the sensitivity of the ClA's intelligence and

counterintelligence activities, and national security. The Commis

sion's Report does not address the disposition of its records, wheth-

er the CIA records reviewed were ever transferred outside the

agency for purposes of review, the review of records from other

agencies,

or the whereabouts of Commission records such as inter-

views with CLA personnel and other sources. The former Executive

Director of the Commission, stated that he had no knowledge of

where the Commission's records were sent, and that his own Free-

dom of Information Act request made in 1975 to disclose the Com-

mission's records was denied."

The existence and scope of relevant records is not fally known by

he Committee. Archivists at the Ford Presidential Library state

that President Ford donated Rockefeller Commission records to the

Library as part of his personal papers. Approximately 4,000 pages

of this material pertains to the investigation of the Kennedy assag-

sination. Such material has been identified through existing find-

ing aids,

file marking, and efforts by Ford Library archivists to

trace subjects and names

discussed

in these materials to other

source material used and developed by the Commission. These ma-

terials can be divided between recorde

related to

the work of the

Commission on the assassination specifically, and the work of the

Commission and other agencies with

regard to Cuba

and Fidel

Castro.

The Commission records ranges from administrative files to

the Zapruder film, and includes depositions, official and unofficial

transcripts of interviews and testimony, and other materials. The

agency records include a variety of classified documents, including

The Church Committee, which went out of existence on May 81,

1976, forwarded all of its files pertaining to its investigation to the

Senate Select Committee on

Intelligence. The Senate Intelligence

Committee has never administratively transferred these records to

the National Archives through the office of the Secretary, of the

Senate.

They remain under the custody.of the Senate Intelligence

Committee,

with the majority, and perhaps the

entirety, of the

records maintained in a secure storage area at the National Ar-

chives.

Until they are transferred administratively to the Archives,

they are not subject to S. Res.

474 that clarifies procedures for

access to non-current Senate recorde at the National Archives.

The

existence of records relevant to the assassination of President Ken-

nedy is reflected in a statement by the Select Committee in its

Report: "In the course of this investigation,

more than 50 witnesses

were either interviewed or deposed. Literally tens of thousands of

pages of documentary evidence were reviewed at the agencies and

more than 5,000 pages were acquired. In addition, the Committee

relied on a great deal of testimony taken during the course of its

investigation of alleged plots to

assassinate foreign l

leaders, espe

cially testimony of knowledge relating to these plot.'
