ADMINISTRATIVE

On 8/4/67, LA 4448-C-TE advised that with the

death of Los Angeles ICN "Boss" FRANK DESIMONE on that date,

that

"Under-Boss" NICK LICATA would be in charge of the Los

Angeles ICN "Brugad".

Informant stated that LICATA will

remain in charge until a new

"Boss" is selected.

is selected to be the new "Boss

Informant-stated that, almost Invarible, a "Capo"

While this is not always

true, it is, generally, the practice. Informant stated that

"Under-Boss" is seldom selected to replace a "Boss"

Informant stated that this is true because a "Capo" is more

powerful than the "Under-Boss"

, "Capo" is at the operational

level of the organization and the

"members" are assigned

directly to him.

An "Under-Boss" has no "members" assigned

directly to him.

This 1s one of the reasons why informant does not,

presently, feel that

"Under-Boss" NICK LICATA will be selected

as the new

"Boss"

In addition, informant noted the resentment

of various ICN "members" towards LICATA because of his lack of

positive and productive leadership.

Informant stated that he was certain that LICATA

would attempt to line up support in a bid to

name him (LICATA

as "Boss"

Another candidate would be

"Capo" JOSEPH DIPPOLITO.

Informant noted that it was yet too early to know what direction

the various bids for power within the los Angeles "Brugad"

would take.

Informant stated. on 8/4/67 that a new "BÃ´ss" would

be selected by a vote of each ICN ilmember" of the "Brugad"

Informant noted, however, that this was far from being as

democratic as it sounded.

Generally, he noted, the ranking

and more powerful

"members" of the

"Brugad"

agree among

themselves who will be

"Boss"

The "Capos", in turn,

contact their

"Members" for their approval.

"Members"

generally vote as a block for the man their "Capo" is backing.

Informant noted, at this point, that the key man

In the selection of the new "Boss" would, in informant's

opinion, be JOHN

Informant stated that ROSELLI,

undoubtedly, would be contacted and consulted relative to his

views and his choice as

"Boss", Informant felt that the opinion

of ROSELLI would be persuasive on the Los Angeles "members"
