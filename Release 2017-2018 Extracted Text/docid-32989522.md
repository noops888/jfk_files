PROTECTION OF THE PRESIDENT

1/17/64

111"=

1118-47.5668 SLDKSL

(JFK)

Enclosed herewith for the FBI Laboratory are the

original and seven copies of a letterhead memorandum suitable

for dissemination.

On 1/4/64, Mr. E. I. SCOTT, Supervisor, Research

Photograph, Mead Central Research, The Mead Corporation,

Chillicothe, Ohio, contacted SA ROBERT J. BARADA of the

eye cameras"

on the Presidential car. Mr. SCOIT indicated

that the use of this type of camera mounted on the Presidential

car while President was travelling through various cities

would record any action against the President and could later

be used as evidence.

He stated that in his opinion it could

also be used as a protective device. Mr. SCOTT specified the

fish-eye cameras would merely record action on a movie-type

film. It was suggested to Mr. SCOIT by SA BARADA that this

could possibly be used in connection with a closed television

circult by which one man could monitor the complete area

around the President's car. He stated this would be an

additional possibility but would have several limitations.

The attached letterhead memorandum which includes

a sketch by Mr. SCOTT of the mounting of the cameras and

notations of how they would operate is being forwarded to

the FBI Laboratory for their observations and notations. It

is thought that after reviewing the suggestion by SCOTT, the

Laboratory may went to make some additions or corrections

and if justified may want to refer the suggestion to Secret

Service.

## Page 20

Mr. Scott further indicated that an additional

possibility would be a closed circuit television setup

utilizing "Elah-eye" lens, wiere one or two Secret Service

agents could observe the entire area around the President

by riding in a car carrying & screen on which the closed

circuit television would be projected. Mr. Scott indicated,

however, that there were limitations to this type of a

arrangement. He atated that all pictures would have to be

on tape, and power failure or circult troubla could cause

interference at a crucial time.

He indicated that tho

combined televisions and twin cameras would give coverage

that would be Invaluable as a documentary record as well as

an imediate observation of the area.

Mt. scott indicated that the photographs in the

camera could later be developad and examined and known

fanatica and agitatore could be pinpointed at various

locations, If these individuals continued to Ie-appear in

different locations some action might be warranted.

Attached herewith is a photostatic copy of a

diawing made by Mr. Scott diagraming hia aforementioned

suggestion.

Mr. Scott indicated that his idea in submitting

the above suggestion was without any thought of personel

publicity ox temunaration and he atated that in his opinion

this was a small way in which he could contribute something

for the good of his country.

NOTE FOR SACS:

Enclosed for each office is I copy each of 2 letters, true

copies of those letters, and & envelopes received by General Gavin

who furnished them to the Bureau. They were mailed from

Corpus Christi, Texas, 6/2/68 and 5/23/68. Reference is made to

Bureau phone calls to New York and Houston, 6/10/68, in which you

were instructed to advise U. §. Secret Service locally and appropriate

local authorities of the possible threats. Houston promptly discuss

the facts in this case with the appropriate U. S. Attorney for a

prosecutive opinion under the Federal Extortion Statute. Advise

Bureau results in form suitable for dissemination. New York insure

that U. S. Secret Service and local authorities have been advised.

This is being submitted to the Dallas Office for information as it is

indicated the subject has mailed letters in the past to General Gavin

from Thunderbird Lodge, Abilene, Texas.

General Gavin, by letters dated 6/7/68, furnished a

letter containing possible threats to the children of former Fresident

Lennedy. This letter contains no legible signature. By letter dated

the same date, General Gavin advised his secretary had found other

letters, apparently sent by the same individual, in his files. He

indicated he does not know this individual. The other letters were

sent to him by Wendall Tarver, 1435 Devon Drive, Apt. #5,

vorpus christ, Texas, 78415.

The threatening communication is

being examined in the EBI Laboratory. A comparison will be made

of the threatening communication with the other letters sent by Tarver

to determine if he is the writer of the letter containing possible threats.

You will be advised of the results.

NOTE:

By letter dated 6/7/68, former Lt. General James M.

Gavin, Cambridge, Massachusetts, forwarded a letter containing an

illegible signature which, at the end states, "The Beret people is

going to take Care of John John and Caroline Kennedy." The letter

is rambling in nature, is illegible in some instances,

however, is a

scurrilous, anti-Semitic communication. By another letter dated

the same date, General Gavin stated his secretary had found other

letters sent to him, apparently by the writer of the scurrilous

communication. They were sent to him by the subject Wendall Tarver

of Corpus Christi, Texas. General Gavin indicated he does not

know Tarver.

Bureau files indicate a person by the name of Wendall J.

Parver, possibly identical with the subject, wrote the Bureau in 1967

saying he was accused by State Department of corresponding with

individuals out of the United States. Secret Service advised Friday,

June 10, 1968.

General Gavin is retired from the U. S. Army and is

currently with Arthur D. Little, Inc., a research organization in

Cambridge, Massachusetts.

NOTE :

Dr: Nichols has previously corresponded with the

concerning medical studies he has made which apparently have

convinced. him. that the late President Kennedy was shot at least

once from the front instead of only from the rear as found

by the Warren Commission.

He has brought an unsuccessful

suit against the Government under the Public Information Law

for the notes and work papers of the FBI-Laboratory examiners

concerning their spectrographic analysis of the bullets

uncovered in the examinations. The "C" items,."K" items and

Re: Artifacts of the Assassination

of President John F. Kennedy

Dear Mr. Kelley:

Mr. Hoover in his letter (CE 2968) of June 2, 1964, to Mr.

Rankin writes of: cartridge cases C6, C7, and C38, as well

as cartridge C8, and rifle C 14.

Mr. Hoover, in his letter, Thermofax® copy enclosed, of July 8,

1964, to Mr. Rankin writes of: C1, C2, C4, C5, C9, and C 16.

Mr. Hoover, in his report, five (5) page thermofax® copy enclosed,

to Mr. Jesse Curry, under date of November 23, 1963, writes of:

Q1, Q2,Q3,04,Q5,Q6,Q7,Q8,Q9,Q14, Q15, andrifteKI.

I should greatly appreciate if you could correlate these "C" and

"Q" numbers for me with the final Commission Exhibit (CE)

numbers and advise where, in the Warren Commission Reoprt

and/or Testimony and Exhibits of the hearings the correlations

may be found.

Commission Exhibit 840 in the photograph on page 840 of volume

17, prepared by the FBI, shows three (3) pieces of metal. How -

ever, a recent photograph of this same exhibit prepared for me by

tro archie see her to pieces of meter

the Archivist shows only two pleces of metal. As you can see

under date of January 4, 1974, he "assumes" that the missing

piece was not delivered to him from the FBI. I should greatly

appreciate if you could advise me the disposition of this missing

third piece of metal from this exhibit 840.

VERSITY OF KANSAS

MEDICAL CENTER

The official photograph of C'E 842, as found on page 841 of

volume 17, intends to show metal removed from Governor

John Connally's wrist. I can detect, presumably, one piece

of metal; it is impossible to express further opinion from

photograph.

Mr. Hoover's report to Mr. Curry mentions Q9 as "metal

fragment" [singularl from the Governor's arm. The

operative report (CE 392) of the surgeon, Doctor Gregory,

mentions "Small bits of metal...these were"

This is plural. In his testimony on page 122 of volume 4,

Doctor Gregory speaks of "two fragments".

Mr. Frazier, on page 72 of volume 5, testified, in response

to a question from Mr. Specter about the "fragment" thus:

"that is the one from Governor... I do not know where

Captain Fritz obtained it [singular].

A photograph, taken by the Archivist, and appearing in Mr.

Josiah Thompson's book Six Seconds in Dallas (Bernard

Geis, New York, 1967) on page 147 clearly shows two pieces

of metal as CE 842.

A special photograph taken for the undersigned by the Archivist

clearly shows three (3) pieces of metal being C E 842.

I should appreciate if you could advise me how many pieces of

metal were removed from the Governor's arm and comprise

CE 842, and its various earlier code numbers.

Finally, it is alleged that samples of metal was removed from

some of these specimens for destructive spectrographic analysis

and I should greatly appreciate if you could advise me how much

was removed from each specimen and how much un - analyzed

specimen of each remains. Shall look forward to hearing from

yOu.

Re: Records of the

Dear Mr. Kelley:

I should like to obtain 8x 10 glossy prints of Commission

Exhibits 562 and 564. Prints previously prepared for me by

the Archivist are of poor quality inasmuch as they are second

generation prints in which the engraver's grid marks are

clearly visible. I am advised that the FBI has the original

negatives.

Also I should like to obtain 8x10 glossy prints of the whole

primers showing firing pin marks of certain cartridges being

Commission Exhibits 141, 543, 544, 545, 557(a) and 557 (b).

I want the ones which were all taken under identical lighting

conditions, at the sam e magnification, and printed at the same

magnification. Some of these were used in Commission

Exhibits 559 -565 and 613 - 624.

Enclosed is personal check number 6757 payable in the amount

of $4.00 calculated at 50¢ per print as previous photographs

of July 18, 1973.

The Honorable William B. Saxbe

Attorney General of the United States

Department of Justice

Washington, D. C. 20530

Dear Mr. Saxbe:

This is an appeal of a decision by FBI Director Clarence Kelley, I am

seeking access to certain scientific laboratory data compiled by the FSI Labor-

atory in 1964 in connection with the investigation of the assassination of

President Kennedy. The data were not made available to the Warren Commission

and have been withheld from the public for the past ten years.

23 G

Director Kelley has indicated a desire to be of assistance in making the

data available, but he apparently feels there is some statutory or departmental

I

prohibition on the release of such data, and even on the answering of questions

pertaining to it. He has suggested that I appeal directly to you.

To explain my request and to set forth the basis for my appeal, I invite

your consideration of the enclosures to this letter.

THAY

Enclosure (1), dated July 8, 1964, is a copy of a letter from the late

FBI Director Esover, which establishes that the FbI Laboratory performed iwo

soparate analyses of certain bullet fragments recovered in the investigation

of the assassination. The second and third paragraphs of this letter from

Director Hoover disclose that the more sensitive of the two analyses, the

neutron activation analysis, revealed "minor variations in composition" among

some of the fragments.

However, no specifics or actual data from the analysis

are disclosed, and the letter sidesteps any definitive conclusions about the

ERI

possible significance of the observed variations:

## Page 54

The Honorable William B. Saxbe

Page 2

May 17, 1974

Enclosure (2) is my letter of March 8, 1974, to Director Kelley, wherein

I ask for the details of the neutron activation analysis results; either through

access to the actual laboratory data, or alternatively, through answers to

certain specific questions which I enumerated on page 3 of Enclosure (2). This

letter also explains how the reported "minor variations in composition" could

• be of crucial significance in assessing the validity of the Warren Commission's

hypothetical explanation of the shooting, and why a discretionary release of

the data might assist in resolving public doubts about the case.

Enclosure (3), dated March 20, 1974, is Director Kelley's reply. He

asserts that the FBI had furnished the results of the neutron activation analysis

to the Warren Commission in its letter of July 8, 1964, i. e., in Enclosure (1),

and that these results are "now available for review at the National Archives as

part of the Commission's documents"

'. Unfortunately, Director Kelley was in

. error. Inquiry at the National Archives revealed that there was nothing on file

there conceming the neutron activation analysis of the bullet fragments beyond

the FBI letter of July 8, 1964, itself, to which there were no attachments or

enclosures. Obviously, the FBI letter of July 8, 1964, does not provide answers

to the specific requests made in my letter to Director Kelley.

Enclosure (4), dated April 23, 1974, is my second letter to Director Kelley,

in which I pointed out the insufficiency of the information contained in the FBI

letter of July 8, 1964, to which he had referred me. I emphasized the possibility

of deriving additional conclusions from the laboratory data if they were made

available to me, and I reiterated the requests I had made in my letter of March 8.

Enclosure (5), dated May 6, 1974, is Director Kelley's second reply. He"

indicates that he would like to be of assistance, which suggests that he would

prefer to release the data, but that he must decline my request because of the

provisions of Title 5, United States Code, Section 552 (b) (7). He then refers me

to you.

It is my understanding of 5 U.S.C. 552 that the exemptive provisions in

Subsection (b) are discretionary with the agency involved. In fact, the Justice

Department's own regulations in support of this statute, specifically those

published in 28 CFR 16A, Subsection 16.1 (a), provide:

"з.

"To the extent permitted by other laws, the Department also will

make available records which it is authorized to withhold under

5 U.S.C. 552 whenever it determines that such disclosure is in

the public interest."

The Honorable William B. Saxbe

Lage 3

May 17, 1974

To my knowledge, there are no other laws prohibiting disclosure of this type

of information from FBI investigative files. Moreover, the files of the Warren

Commission already contain voluminous materials from FBI investigative files

'most of them available to the public. Accordingly, there is no binding prohi-

bition on disclosure of the information I am seeking.

It is also my understanding from various news reports that the FBI

recently adopted a more open policy on disclosures of information to the

public. In the past six months, extensive FBI files on the Hiss, Rosenberg,

and Ezra Pound cases have reportedly been released. If that is true, would

It not be consistent with this policy to release the small amount of FBI lab-

oratory data I am seeking, considering that it relates to so historic a case

as the assassination of President Kennedy? Or should we infer that the

Justice Department feels there is something about this case which must still

be concealed from the public?

As we all know, the President of the United States has recently dis-

closed extensive transcripts of his conversations with advisors. These

contain numerous unflattering characterizations of individuals and other

details potentially harmful to persons who are the subjects of current criminal

prosecution by your Department. Ihave heard no protests from the Department

of Justice about these public disclosures, from which I infer that you determined

that such disclosures were "in the public interest".

How, then, can it be

maintained that it would not be in the public interest to release purely factual

scientific data bearing on the validity of the Warren Commission's explanation

of the assassination of President Kennedy more than ten years ago? Is this not

an absurd inconsistency on the part of the Federal Government?

During the past week, the United States Supreme Court has declined to

review a lower court decision which had denied public access to the detailed

results of the spectrographic analysis described in the first paragraph of

Enclosure (1). Thus, the Court has said, in effect, that the public has no

right, as a matter of law, to know the full details of the FBI investigation of

the assassination of President Kennedy. I should like to point out, however,

that the Court's decision in no way affects or limits the discretionary power

of the Attomey General to release such data if he finds it in the public interest

to do so. Moreover, my request concerns the entirely separate neutron activa-

tion analysis data which, according to Enclosure (1), produced results which

differed quantitatively from those of the spectrographic analysis and were not

taken into account by the Warren Commission. The continued withholding of

this information by the Justice Department strikes me as a moral dereliction of .

duty to the public, even though it may not be in conflict with the law.

PUBLIC; LAW 93-502, AMENDMENTS

TO THE FREEDOM OF

5, UNITED STATES CODE,

The purpose of this memorandun is to bring to the

attention of all Bureau Officials and Supervisors information

and pertinent guidelines, in addition to those contained in

attached proposed letter to. all SACs, resulting from the new.

amendments to the FOIA.

Additional guidelines and observations

will be submittez for consideration from tine to time as expo-

zience gained under the provisions warrant.

reprasentatives

of the FOIA Unit will be available to aúdress Division confer-

ences regarding this Act.

As you have previously been advised; the Freedom of

Information Act (EOIA)

was recently amended and the amendments

became effective February 19, 1975. Copies of the FOIA incor-

porating the recent amendments are now available and are

attached for your information. As can be seen fron the attached

reprint, the primary effect of the new amendments is to increase

the administrative burden of processing Isquests under the Act,

which is being handled by the Legislative Matters Section, FOIA

Unit of the Legal Counsel Division.

Occasionally, however, the

assistance of other Divisions will be necessary in resolving

guestions concerning a particular request.

The amended Act has altered the previous Act in

three major areas of concern to the FbI.

1. Change in Exemotion (b) (1). This exemption

relates to classified national defense and foreign policy

The major change in this area is that the amended

Act expressly provides for in camera juäicial inspection of

any documents withheld under this exemption, with the purpose

of ascertaining is they are "properly"

classified. As a

result of

this provision, a revier of all classified docu-

ments will be made prior to assertion of this axemption, to

insure the classification is pioper and current.

Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams memo

Re:

Public Law 93-502

2. Change in Exemption (b) (7) The Language of

this exemption has been changed from

"investigatory files"

under the old Act to "investigatory records" under the present

Act, and the bases for withholding records falling in this

category have been narrowed to six specified situations.

The situations in which investigatory records may

be withheld are specified in the amended Act and may be briefly

described as follows:

Where release of the record would...

(1) interfere with enforcement proceedings (investigation or

prosecution) (2) deprive a person of a fair trial (3) constitute

an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy (4) disclose the

identity of a confidential source (either a paid informant

or any citizen furnishing information to us with an express

or implied assurance of confidentiality) (5) disclose investi-

gative techniques and procedures, or (6) endanger the life ox

safety of law enforcement personnel.

3.

Processing of Requests. The amended Act has

imposed a statutory requirement that an agency respond

to an

FOIa request by either denying or granting the request within

ten working days, or in certain specified instances within 20

wosking days..

As pointed out above, the amendments have also

drastically revised the "investigatory files" exemption and

now refers to "investigatory records."

The effect of these

two modifications

is to greatly increase the administrative

burden of processing FOIA requests.

The change in the wording

from "files" to "records" requires

a document-by-document review

of the files falling within the scope of the request. The exemp-

tion for investigatory records is now such that it also requires a

page-by-page review to justify withholding of the information

contained in these records.

The Act also requires that any

"reasonably segregable" portions of a record be made available

to the requester after the portions which are exempt have been

deleted.

This means that any documents not exempt in their

entirety must be read and deleted on a paragraph-by-paragraph

basis.

As mentioned above, the modification of the

(0) (1)

exemption now requires us

to review the classification of

documents before the (b) (1) exemption is asserted.

As can be seen from the above explanation, the bases

for withholding information in a closed investigatory file arc

limited.

The two most frequently relied-on exemptions when

dealing with an inactive investigation are

(b) (7) (C)

(unwar-

ranted invasion of personal privacy) and (b) (7) (D) (information

furnished with an express or implied assurance of confidentiality).

Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams memo

Re: PubLIC Law 93-502

Assertion of these exemptions relies heavily on the assumption

that an individual who cooperates with this Bureau in the course

of an official investigation does not wish to have his identity

or the information he furnished released to the

subject of the

investigation or to third parties, unless this is necessary in

enforcement proceedings of a judicial nature. The Legal Counsel

Division is giving consideration to suggesting adoption of certain

procedures by the field in recording the results of our interviews

in order to strengthen our position in asserting these

exemptions.

Before adoption of any such procedures, the views of other Divisions

as to the effect these procedures might have on dissemination of

information and related

• problems will be solicited.

Additionally, to enable the FOIA Unit to comply

with the short statutory deadlines imposed by the Act,

normally

ten working days, it will be necessary for all other Divisions

to cooperate expeditiously in the handling of these matters when

called upon to do so.

This will involve insuring that any mis-

directed FOIA requests received by other Divisions are transmitted

to the Legislative Matters Section, Room 4503, Justice Building,

Attention: FOIA Unit, by the most expeditious means avail-

The time limit for response to a request generally

begins to run from the date the request is received in any

Division of EBI HQ. As the applicability of some of

the exemptions depend upon whether release of the information

requested would interfere with an ongoing investigation or

enforcement proceedings, it will on some occasions be necessary

for the FOIA Unit to consult with other Divisions concerning

their opinion as to the effect release of information would

have on an ongoing case. In some situations, also, the Division

handling the substantive violation may be consulted to provide

background data, in order to ascertain if the continued classi-

fication of a particular document is justified.

RECOMMENDATION:

The attached letter to all SACs be sent, which

explains the recent amendments to the FOIA and sets out

procedures for handling FOIA requests or inquiries received by

Field Offices.

As you will recall, the FOIl Icquires Government

agencies to furnish recordis and documents to the public upon

request subject to several exceptions or exemptions which allow

the withholding of records and docuents in cortain specified

situations.

The primary lifect of the recent amendments is to:

(1) Feduce the tine available to an agency for

responding to an FOIA request to ten working days, or in

certain specific situations 20 working days.

(2) Provide for in canera court review of any classi-

fied docuients withhold under axerntion (b) (1) to ascertain if

the classification is proper.

Memorandum to All Special Agents in Charge

Re: Public Law 93-502

_being forwarded to FBI HQ for consideration. The request

should then be transmitted by airtel to FBI HQ, Attention:

Legal Counsel Division, Legislative Matters Section, on an

expedite basis. The airtel transmitting the letter should

provide a summary of any background data available on the

subject matter of the request.

In the event telephonic or

personal

inquiries are received concerning the procedures for

making requests under the Act, the requester should be advised

to direct a written request to the Director, FBI, Washington,

D. C. 20530. The envelope and letter should be marked "Ereedom

of Information Act Request," or similar wording.

The time

period for response to an FOIA request will not begin to run

until the request is received at FBI HQ.

The princioal effect of the extensive amendment

to the investigatory files exemption, Section 552 (b) (7),

is to allow the withholding of records from our investigatory

files only in six specified circumstances which are set out

in the Act.

We anticipate that in handling these requests we

will rely heavily on subsection (b) (7) (D) which allows with-

holding of information furnished by an individual who is a

"confidential source."

The term

"confidential source" has

been interpreted in the legislative history of the Act and

through analysis of the Act by the Department of Justice, as

covering not only informants but any citizen who furnishes

information to an agency with the express assurance of con-

fidentiality or under circumstances where such an assurance

could reasonably be inferred.

Efforts will be made during initial and follow-up

in-service training of Field Office Legal Counsel, to cover

in detail the provisions of the Act. Any inquiries concerning

other problems arising under the Act should be directed to the

Legislative Matters Section, Legal Counsel Division, FBI HQ.

Additional guidelines and interpretations concerning the Act,

resulting from expected court decisions and experience gained

in applying its different provisions, will be furnished you

from time to time where necessary.

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION

HAHOLD WEISBENG

By memorandum of 3/16/11, attached, the Department has referred for

comment a request from Mr. Weisberg for additional photographs of President

Kennedy's clothing.

Welsberg Is the author of several books pertaining to the assassination,

Including 'Whitewash - The Report of the Warren Commission." His writings for the

moat part are vitriolic criticisma of the Warren Commission, the FBI, the Secret

Service and several other U. S. Government agencies, as well as the Dallas Police

Department. His writings contain inaccuracles, falseroods and the deliberate

slanting of tacts to sult his purpose. There haa been considerable past correspondence

between Welaberg and the Department, and the Department and the Bureau concerning

photographs and other material in our flies relating to the investigation of the

assassination of President Kennedy.

In memoranda from the Department dated 5/19 and 6/22/70, and our

keplies of 5/28 and 7/1/70, relating to requeste from Welaberg, we furnished to

the Department a photograph showing the tabs of the President's shirt and three

additlonal photographs showing the back of the ahirt, a close-up of the ares containing

the bullet hole in the back of the shirt, and a pluture of the knot in the necktle.

By memorandum from the Departmont dated 8/13/70, the Bureau was

, adviaed that a complaint had been flled in the U. S. District Court for the District of

Columbla entitled Harold Weisberg V. Department of Justice, Civil Actlon No. 2301-70,

under the Freedom of Information Act, to force the Government to "produce and make

avallaule for copying the spectrographle analyses of the various bullets and fragments

inrolved in the assassination of Prealdent Kennedy. This clvil suit was the outgrowth

of Walsberg's continuing efforts to obtain detalled notes, worksheets and photographic

plates comprising the "raw data" upon which the conclusions of Laboratory examiners

were based. Our filed show that this action is still pending.

We took the position in this latter matter that the materials requested

were part of the Bureau's Investigative files pertaining to the assassination and hence

Weisberg's request should be dented on the basis of the exception in the reedom of

Information Act which specifically exempts investigative flles compiled for lar

enforcement purposes, Title 5 United States Code, Sectlon 552 (b) (7). This matter

has been discussed and coordinated with the Office of Legal Counsel.

RUCOMMENDATION:

(1) Although we have furnished photographic material to the Department

previously which has been furnished Welsberg, in vlew of the pending litigation it

is recommended that we request the Department to deny this most recent request.

(2) There is attached for approval a proposed letter to the Department

sotting forth our views and returning the enclosures to the Department's memorandam.

Dear Director Kelley:

First, I would like to thank, you for your letter of

March

20, 1975 and the enclosure, which, contributed

much to my ünderstanding of the FBI investigation into

this matter.

I have a document from the Warren Commission's files

(document enclosed) that. lends itself to several

interpretations - one which could reflect badly on the

FBI.

In a November 22, 1963 report of transmittal of

ballistics evidence from the autopsy at Bethesda Naval

Hospital

to the FBI Laboratory, agent Francis X: O'Neill,

Jr., lists a "missle" recovered by the autopsy doctors.

I realize FBI agents Sibert and O'Neill transmitted

several tiny bullet fragments to the FBI Lab (CE 843)

for examination.

Are they referring.to these fragments

or are they reporting the recovery of a bullet?

ncerely

EXAMINATION OF ALPNOTIC FRIZZIGS

During the secent American Academy of Forensic

Sciences meeting in Chicago, Dr. Seymour Follack, poychiatrist

at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles,

presented a discussion of hypnotic writings which he classified

as autonatic writings.

Dr. Pollack stated thai his study followed the

clain nade in the Sirhan Sirhon trial that the writings in

Sirhan's noteboo's were prepared thile Sirhon was under a state

of self hypnosis. This clain was successfully reluted duving

the trial of Sirhan.

Subsequent to the trial, Dr.

Pollack conducted

experiments concerning aucomatic (hypnotic) mritings.

experiments he requested that each subject present normal

undictated writings prepared prior to the caparinent. Le

also cotainod dictated bandwriting sanples which vere written

prior to hypnosis. Ho then obtained dictated vritings propared

under hypnosis.

Finally, he obtained handwriting samples

subsequent to hypnosis.

Dr. Pollack then subsequently presented the

handwriting samples to.

Lawrence Sloan,

Sx., docusent examiner,

LoS Angeles, With the request that Sian determine which of

the Fritings were prepared under hypnosis.

Dr. Pollack

reported that Sloan erred : in about 70 per cent of his

writings certain of the sritings examined. This was the

result of comparisons with normal writings of the subjects.

Sloan also reportodly nade 100 per cent error in labeling

the mritings prepared subsequent to hypnosis as being

automatic (hypnotic) writings.

Br. Pollack appears to be an extrenely conpetent

psychiatrist and was very sincere in his discussions.

He

suggested that Sloan's errors may have been the result of

"over predicting," as frequently happens in

the psychiatric

field.

Also, Dr. Pollac's staied that he considered the field

of hypnotic writings a propec field for experiments.

The above observations would tend to indicate that

Sloan nay have made a series oi speculations in his examinations,.

that there was an insulficient amount of writings available

to suitably permit positive determinations, and possibly that

some hypnotic writings cannot be determined from examination.

KENSALT

(ASSASSINATION OF

SENATOR ROBERT F. KENNEDY

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA)

The Los Angeles Office has forwarded to the Bureau a letter dated

1/7/69, from the Los Angeles Police Department signed by Deputy Chief Robert A.

Houghton, requesting that the firearms examinations conducted by the

Los Angeles Police Department in this case, be duplicated by the FBI Laboratory

personnel.

The letter states, "A separate and independent analysis would be of value

in later refuting any claims attacking the validity of the examination by a single

department and should preclude disputes or frivolous complaints. "

The duplication of examinations, such as requested, is in direct

opposition to the long-standing examination policy of the Laboratory. There

appears to be no advantage to be gained by the Bureau by conducting the re-examina-

tion of this evidence and the Los Angeles Office recommends that the examinations

not be conducted. Moreover, current newspaper reports quote the Chief Defense

Counsel, Grant B. Cooper, as stating in open Court, "There will be no denial of

the fact that Sirhan B. Sirhan fired the shot or shota that killed Senator Kennedy."

These same newspaper reports further indicate that defenge strategy will be to

prevent the prosecution from proving the key element of premeditated, conscious

intent to kill. Accordingly, duplication of the firearms examination would have

no bearing on this element.

ACTION:

(1) In view of the circumstances mentioned above, it is recommended that

we decline to re-examine this evidence.

(2) Il approved, the Los Angeles Office will be advised accordingly.

-ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR

ROBEFT F. JENNEDY

On 10/14/60,-Dx. John Holloway, Deputy Medical Examiner,

Los Angeles County, California,

, telephonically contacted the Laboratory

at the request of the Chief Medical Examiner for Los Angeles, Er. Thomas

T. Noguchi, Dr. Holloway stated that in a recent conference at the

White House relative to this case, President Johnson expressed the desire

to Dr. Noguchi to have a Federal laboratory conduct neutron activation

analyses on certain items of evidence collected by the Los Angeles,

California Police Department and his office.

Dr. Holloway was inquiring if the FBI Laboratory could examine

by neutron activation analysis methods a specimen bullet, foreign metallic

deposits on a piece of bone and several biological specimens containing

foreign metallic deposits. The purpose of such examinations is to show

that the foreign metal deposits originated from a bullet of the same lot as

used by assassin Sirhan Bishara Sirhan.

It was explained to Dr. Holloway that it was doubtful that such

I conclusions could be reached from such an analysis and that at best, it

might be concluded that the foreign metal smear could have originated from

a bullet of sirallar composition. Our policy of not examining materials

previously examined by other laboratories was also defined to Dr. Holloway.

Dr. Holloway was not certain as to what examinations had been made but

stated he would find out.

Upon conclusion of the discussion, Dr. Holloway advised that he

would contact Er. Noguchi and subsequently make a formal written request

setting forth the examinations desired and the extent and nature of prior

analyses. Or. Holloway was advised that upon recelpt of such information,

the Bureau, could then determine whether or not we would consider making any

analyses.

This material has been thoroughly reviewed and contains,

for the most part, letters of condolences. In addition, there are many

communications which are unintelligible, obviously prepared by

indiviquals sultering from mental instability. One of the letters contained

a check for a contribution to a Jewish home.

One of the letters, postmarked Fittsburgh, Pennaylvania,

KENSALT

By memorandum A. rosen to DeLoach 6-12-68, it was recommended

and approved by the Director that certain procedures be followed in reporting

results of examinations by the FBI Laboratory or Identification Division in

captioned case. Reports of results of examinations of evidence submitted by

FBI field offices are to be addressed to the Los Angeles County Prosecuting

Attorney, E. J. Younger, with copies to pertinent FBI Divisions and Offices.

Administrative data and other information of special Bureau interest would

not be sent to Younger.

The attached Laboratory report relating to a voice comparison

examination contains information showing handling of evidence only.

The

questioned materials consisted of a tape recording of an unknown caller to

the Hilly Rose Radio Show, Station KNEW, Oakland, California. The known

material consisted of recordings of 8. B. Sirhan made by the Los Angeles

Police Department.

The transmittal page contains administrative data for

investigative guidance revealing that the voice of Sirhan differs in significant

characteristics from the voice of the anonymous caller to fadio Station KNEW,

and it is not likely they are the same speaker. It is, therefore, felt that

since no purpose would be served by submitting this report to the Los Angeles

County officials, the report should be sent directly to the contributor, the

Los Angeles FBI Office, in accordance with normal procedures.

ACTION:

It is recommended that the attached report be sent directly to

the FBI Los Angeles Field Office.

the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy has been

received from the Los Angeles Office.

Previous reports

were furnished the Department on June 17 and June 21, 1968.

Major aspects of our investigation have been completed and

investigation has failed to establish the existence of a

conspiracy.

This report, which is three volumes, has a brief

synopsis, a table of contents, and an index.

It has

beem

thoroughly reviewed for accuracy and content.

In summary, this report sets forth

additional

inquiries at the gun club where Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, the

accused assailant, was seen practicing with his .22 caliber

pistol on June 4, 1968; it includes results of our searching

inquiry into his

background and the background of his family;

and likewise, sets forth results of interviews with customers

at the ammunition store where he is known to have purchased

ammunition on at least one occasion.

Investigation at the

Golden Garter Bar, Alhambra, California, where Sirhan was

alleged to have been seen during late May, 1968, is also

included in this report. Employees of the Ambassador Hotel,

the scene of the shooting, members of Kennedy's staff as

well as the press covering his victory speech in the Embassy

Room of the hotel, have been interviewed in detail. None of

these interviews lend any support to the fact that

Sirhan

was assisted by one or more fellow conspirators.

In conclusion, we included details relative to the

results of FBI Laboratory examinations of much of the physical

evidence connected with this case.

KENSALT

The have received from the Los Angeles Division of the

Bureau approximately 28, 000 .22 caliber cartridge cases for

comparison with a cartridge case from Sirhan Sirhan'a revolver.

Los lingeles advises that these cartridge cases were obtained

from the San Gabriel Valley Gua Club where, it is understood,

witnesses identified Sirhan as having fired the rerolver, later

identilled by the Los Angeles Police Department as being the

weapon that was used to kill senator Kennedy. All of the

previous firearms examinations in this case were conducted by

the Los Angeles Police Department.

This ezamination was probably requested to show that

Sirhan had been at the firing range and was apparently initiated

prior to the development of the eyewitnesses to this fact. Since

to examine 28,000 cartridge cases would require approximately

500 man hours and since it appears that the results would only

corroborate the eyewitnesses' testimony, the examination of the

cartridge cases would appear to be of little value to the Bureau's

case. (Persons talking to Sirhan at range already identified and interviewed.)

RECOMMENDATION:

In vlew of the previous examinations by the Los Angeles

Police Department and the disproportionate amount of time to

examine the extremely large number of cartridge cases and the

apparent limited value of the resulting Information to the Bureau's

case, it is recommended that we not conduct the examinations.

If the local authortties feel the examination would be of

value to them, we can lurn the cartridge cases over to them lor

examination.

WITNESS ADMITS FALSE TESTIMONY BEFORE

LOS ANGELES GRAND JURY

Bolinf

Vincent Thomas DePierro, a waiter at the Ambassador

Hotel who was walking next to Senator Kennedy at the time he

was shot on June 5, 1968, was afforded a polygraph examination

by the Los Angeles

Police Department on July 1, 1968.

DePierro

had previously advised that he had observed Sirban Sirhan in

the vicinity and claimed Sirhan was talking to a girl in a

polka dot dress just prior thereto. (It was determined that

this girl was not the same as the one allegedly seen by

Sandra Serrano running from the scene. Serrano subsequently

admitted under polygraph examination her information was

completely false).

DePierro testified to the above before the Los Angeles

Grand Jury but after polygraph examination admitted his infor-

mation concerning the girl in the polka, dot dress was entirely

false. He stated he lied solely to make his. story more inter-

esting to the news media and authorities.

Local authorities now indicate that DePierro's value

as a witness concerning the actual shooting has now been destroyed.

SIRHAN'S ATTORNEYS ENGAGE INVESTIGATOR

Los Angeles reports that defense attorneys for Sirhan

engaged a former Los Angeles police officer as investigator for

the defense, michael A. McCowan. According to information fur-

nished by the Los Angeles Police Department McCowan resigned

from the department in 1965 aiter being arrested by postal

inspectors on a mail theft charge.

he received a probationary

sentence and remains on probation at this time. No information

could be located in Bureau files concerning McCowan.

future court proceedings involving Sirhan will be conducted is

being prepared in order to effect maximum security.

The Los

Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted to authorize $20,000

for the protection of Sirhan and also the judge and jury that

will be involved in this trial. Plans call for armor-plated

court room partitions, bulletproof glass and other security

precautions.

MUNIR SIRHAN (SUBJECT'S BROTHER)

UNDERGOES POLYGRAPH EXAMINATION

During the evening of 6/25/68, Munir Sirhan, brother

of Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, was afforded a polygraph examination.

by the Los Angeles Police Department. It was conclided by the

police department that Munir was not involved in the assassina-

tion but that he did lie about the purchase of the gun. (The

gun used in the assassination was traced through several owners,

one of which, George Erhard, advised that he sold the gun to

munir Sirhan while Sirhan Sirhan was present.

Munir had denied

that he ever had ownership of this weapon).

Sirhan Sirhan was identified as purchasing ammunition

at a gun shop on 6/1/68. A salesman in this store alleged that

Sirhan was accompanied by two as yet unidentified individuals.

The polygraph examination indicated that Munir did not accompany

sirhan to this store on 6/1/68.

JOHN FAHAY'S INFORMATION REGARDING WOMAN WHO

KNEW OF ASSASSINATION NOT SUBSTANTIATED

On.6/6/68 John Fahay, a Los Angeles salesman,

claimed that the day before the assassination he met a

woman who apparently knew that Senator Kennedy would be

killed. Investigation has not substantiated any thing

that Fahay hassaid. Fahay's story briefly is as follows:

At about 9 a.m., 6/4/68, (the day before the

assassination) he met

a woman at the Ambassador Hotel

in Los Angeles.

This woman used several names but even-

tually identified herself as Gilderdine Oppenheimer.

She

indicated an urgency to get out of the country and claimed

she was being watched.

Fahay then noticed an individual

nearby that resembled

Munir Sirhan, brother of Sirhan Bishara

Sirhan.

This woman said to Fahay "They are going to take

care of Kennedy." This woman was very upset and Fahay left

the hotel with her and they drove around in Fahay's car.

Most of this time they were followed by unknown individuals.

At approximately 7:30 p.m., on 6/4/68, Fahay returned this

to the Ambassador Hotel.

-DMG

762/

Fahay has furnished his story to Fernando Faura,

a reporter for the "Hollywood Citizen - News" Newspaper,

but there is no indication that his story has been published.

Investigation has failed to verify one scintilla

of Fahay's story. Munir Sirhan was at work from 8:54 am.,

until 6:00 p.m., on 6/4/68.

No woman such as described by

Fahay has been

found to exist and employees at the hotel

do not remember Fahay being there with a woman on 6/4/68.

Fahay has been fired from past employments for fighting

and is described as being "different" and "odd"

WITNESSES TO SHOOTING

Richara C. Lubic, President, Color Corporation of

an individual with a gun and he later recognized photograph

SERRANO'S STORY OF GIRL IN

POLKA DOT DRESS A FABRICATION

As reported previously Sandra Serrano claimed that prior to the

shooting of Senator Robert F. Kennedy she saw a woman in a polka dot

dress and two men, one of whom she identified as Sirhan Bishara Sirhan,

enter the Ambassador Hotel. She also claimed that immediately after the

shooting this woman ran by her shouting "We shot him. We shot him."

On 6-21-68, after a polygraph examination and a lengthy interview

by the Los Angeles, California, Police Department, Miss Serrano admitted

that her story was a complete fabrication.

ALLEGED ASSOCIATE OF SIRHAN SIRHAN

AT SAN GABRIEL VALLEY GUN CLUB

NEVER SAW SIRHAN SIRHAN PREVIOUSLY

Sirhan Sirhan was identified as being at the San Gabriel Valley

Gun Club practicing with a revolver on 6-4-68, the day before the shooting.

An employee of the gun club said that Sirhan Sirhan was seen talking to a

blonde woman and it appeared the two were previously acquainted.

This blonde woman has been identified as Claudia Williams who

with her husband, Ronald, visited the gun club at the time Sirhan was there.

Mr. Williams went to the rifle range and Mrs. Williams went to the pistol

range. Claudia Williams advised she conversed with Sirhan Sirhan at the

pistol range and he assisted her in shooting. Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Williams

had met Sirhan previously.

THREATS MADE TO SIRHAN SIRHAN'S ATTORNEY

The receptionist at the office of Russell E. Parsons, Sirhan's

attorney, Los Angeles, received two telephone calls on 6-20-68 from a

person claiming to be John Lawrence of New York City. This caller

said he was executive secretary of the Clemency Committee for Sirhan

Sirhan and said that Los Angeles criminal attorneys are "crooks" and

will take Sirhan "down the river." He also said "We are out to get !

Mr. Parsons" and claimed that Parsons was being paid $150, 000 to repre-

sent Sirhan.

He said that there are 250, 000 Arabs who are militant and

are not going to let Parsons get away with it. Parsons contacted the

Los Angeles Police Department and requested protection. The police

suggested that he discuss the matter with the presiding judge, Los Angeles

County Superior Court. The presiding judge intends to hold a hearing to

determine it Parsons needs protection. The United States Attorney is

ASSASSINATION OF

SENATOR ROBERT F. KENNEDY

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

As mentioned previously, twenty-year-old Sandra Serrano

appeared on television shortly after Senator Robert F. Kennedy was shot

and claimed that immediately after the shooting a woman in a polka dot

dress ran by her shouting "We shot him. We shot him." According to

Miss Serrano, this woman had entered the Ambassador Hotel prior to the

shooting accompanied by two men, one of whom she identified as Sirhan

Bishara Sirhan. Extensive investigation has failed to substantiate her

story.

On June 21, 1968, after being afforded a polygraph examination

and an extensive interview by the Los Angeles, California, Police Depart-

ment, Miss Serrano admitted that her story was a complete fabrication.

An employee of the San Gabriel Valley Gun Club, Duarte,

California, where Sirhan Bishara Sirhan was seen practicing with a

revolver on June 4, 1968, claimed that Sirhan talked with a blonde woman

at the gun club and it appeared the two had met previously. This woman

has been identified as Mrs. Claudia Williams. She advised she was at the

gun club with her husband, Ronald, on June 4, 1968, and Sirhan assisted

her on the pistol range while her husband was at the rifle range. Neither

Mr. nor Mrs. Williams had met Sirhan previously.

The receptionist at the office of Russell E. Parsons, Sirhan's

attorney, Los Angeles, received two telephone calls on June 20, 1968,

from a person claiming to be John Lawrence of New York City.

A second report totaling 618 pages has been received

irom the Los Angeles Office setting jorth additional investiga-

tion relative to our inquiry into the assassination of Senator

Robert . Kennedy. The initial report was furnished to the

Department on June 17, 1968.

The second report, which is two volumes, has a brief

• synopsis, a table oi contents, and an index.

thoroughly reviewed for accuracy and content.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION SET FORTH IN REPORT:

The initial report set forth results of our imnediate

inquiries into the situation at the Ambassador Hotel where

Senator Kennedy was shot at 12:15 a.m., 6/5/68. The secono

report goes into further details in connection with this

Investigation.

Central Receiving Hospital where Kennedy was taken prior to

being transferred to the Good Samaritan Hospital where un-

successiul surgery was performed.

A complete list of employees at the Ambassador Hotel,

the site of the shooting, has been obtained.

These individuals

have been interviewed in detail relative to their observations

prior to, during, and immediately following the shooting. Addi-

tional witnesses were located who identified Sirhan Bishara

Sirhan as being in the area immediately prior to the shooting

and some are in a position to positively identily him as the

assailant.

We likewise have interviewed individuals attached to

Senator Kennedy's party and members of the press who were in

the arez of the shooting.

Professional football player Roosevelt

Grier was interviewed in detal for his part in helping to disarn

and subdue Sirhan. Grier did not view the actual shooting.

ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR

ROBERT F. KENNEDY

Detailed photographs are included in this report

showing the results of the crime scene search in the area,

the positions of Senator Kennedy and other individuals who

were wounded in the assault, the direction of the bullets

and the position of Sirhan at the time he

initiated the

attack.

Extensive investigation at the San Gabriel Valley

Gun Club is set forth.

It was learned earlier in our inves

tigation that Sirhan had been identified as practicing with

information to the effect that Sirhan was seen taking to an

attractive blonde woman.

It was indicated by this witness

that Sirhan was

previously acquainted with this woman.

A

complete list of

individuals firing at the range on June 4,

Likewise we have interviewed in detail individuals employed

at the range in an effort to pin down this aspact of our in-

vestigation.

(Los Angeles has advised today that the blonde

woman has been identified and interviewed and she has no con-

nection with Sirhan as indicated by the one witness.

This is

being pursued further in order to establish the complete facts.)

Extensive investigation has been conducted into the

background of Sirhan Bishara Sirhan. We have interviewed elemen

tary and high school teachers as well as former employees and

individuals associated with him when he was employed as a gas

station attendant and a race horse exercising boy.

Neighbors

and other associates have likewise been interviewed. The majority

of these individuals express shock at Sirhats becoming involved in

the shooting of Senator Kennedy although it is apparent from

these inquiries that sirhan has, over a period of years, exhibited

very strong nationalistic sympathies toward the Arab nations and

has apparently been frustrated by his inability to "get rich

quick."

Investigation in the neighborhood of the Sirhan home,

696 East Howard Street, Pasadena, indicates that the family kept

not associate with their neighbors.

Back-

ground information concerning the other brothers indicates Munir,

date of birth 7/15/47, has had numerous brushes with the police

authorities as a juvenile in the Pasadena area culminating with

a 1966 arrest for possession of marijuana.

Saidallah, date of

birth 7/4/32, has had two drunk driving convictions and Sharif,

date of birth 6/7/33, was charged with attempted murder (later

disnissed in lieu of

psychiatric treatment) in 1963 in connec

tion with an altercation with a former girl friend who rejected

him. •

Considerable investigation is shown in connection

with our inquiries concerning the girl in the polka dot dress

who was alleged to have fled the scene shortly after the shoot

claims to have seen a woman in a polka dot dress talking with

Sirhan just prior to the shooting. Interviews with these

witnesses definitely show that the dresses worn by these women

are not alike. Extensive interviews were conducted with indi

This is to provide a brief resume of our investigation

to date into the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy at •

Los Angeles, California; to advise of the fact that our first

investigative report, totaling 1,082 pages, has been disseminated

to interested Government agencies and the prosecuting attorney in

Los Angeles, California; and to pinpoint those areas of investi-

gation that

remain.

As approved, copies of our initial investigative report

were. forwarded on 6/17/68 to the Assistant Attorneys General of

the Criminal Division and Civil Rights Division. In accordance

with the reply from the Criminal Division on the same date, we

instructed our Los Angeles Office to forward copies of this report

to Prosecuting Attorney Evelle Younger, at Los Angeles and in

addition, to the United States Attorney at Los Angeles. We also

furnished CIA, Secret Service and State Department, all of whom

have an interest in this case, a copy of this report..

Our investigation to date has established that Sirhan

Bishara Sirhan has evidenced, over a period of years, animosity

toward the State of Israel and has indicated strong nationalistic

sympathies toward the Arab states.

The scribblings and notations

Tound on material located in his room indicated he had, prior to

the actual assassination attempt, given consideration to shooting

Senator Kennedy•

There seems to be a direct tie-in between recent

pro-Israel remarks made by Kennedy and the fact that the shooting

took place on the anniversary of the war between Israel and the

Arab states.

Investigation indicates he purchased ammunition on

June 1; 1968, and participated in target practice the day before

the assassination attempt.

Although investigation has failed thus far to establish

evidence a conspiracy exists, or Sirhan acted in concert with

another, the news media

continually bring to light allegations

conspiracy which thus far are unsubstantiated. With respect to

these rumors, we are concentrating our investigation in three

areas:

1.

The identity of the so-called girl in the polka

dot dress which stems from, thus far, unsubstantiated

and inconsistent statements made by 20-year-old

Sandra Serrano who was at least 140 feet from the

scene of the shooting but who steadfastly maintains

that she heard sounds like shots and saw a girl

running from the area in a

This witness is

scheduled to undergo a polygraph examination by

the Los Angeles Police Department 6/20/68.

An Ambassador Hotel employee has stated he

saw Sirhan standing in the kitchen area just prior

to the

shooting.

He states a white female in a polka

dot dress was standing next to Sirhan and they conversed

briefly.

This female apparently not identical to the

dot dresses differ.

2.

Sirhan has been identified by the wife of the owner

of the gun shop where the ammunition was bought on

June 1, 1968, as having been in the shop during

April, 1968, accompanied by two other "foreign-looking"

individuals

and the salesman in the same store alleges

that on the day Sirhan made his purchase of ammunition

(6//68), he was accompanied by two other as yet

unidentified individuals.

3. Several witnesses positively identified Sirhan as

participating in target practice at the San Gabriel

Valley Gun Club on June 4, 1968. An employee of the

club insists he overheard

a conversation between

Sirhan and an unidentified blonde girl while Sirhan

was firing there. Other witnesses indicate such a

woman. was at the scene but no one substantiates the

lact that she indicated an acquaintanceship with

Sirhan.

These three, as well as all other facets of our

investigation, are receiving exhaustive attention.

The following concerns most recent developments

of Senator Robert F. Kennedy.

1621

JFK Act 6 (1) (B)

Our Los Angeles Office reports that a check of

the Selective Service Headquarters records for the State of

Calitornia shows no registration for Sirhan Sirhan or his

brothers Saidallah Sirhan and Munir Sirhan. The remaining

brothers Sharif

and Adel Sirhan are both registered with

local board 91,

Pasadena, California.

Our Los Angeles Office in noting the failure to

register on the part of Saidallah and Munir Sirhan advised

that all four brothers have apparently been cooperative and

have readily furnished background information relative to

the activities of Sirhan Sirhan. Los Angeles was of the

opinion that to pursue the Selective Service aspect insofar

as Saidallah and Munir are concerned at this time could

possibly adversely affect their cooperative spirit which

has existed thus far.

Selective Service Headquarters for the State of California show no

registration for Sirhan Bishara Sirhan or his brothers Saidallah and

Munir Sirhan. The remaining brothers, Sharif and Adel Sirhai, are

both registered with Local Board 91, Pasadena, California.

Our Los Angeles Office in noting the failure to register for

advised that all four brothers have apparently been cooperative with

the FBI and the Los Angeles Police Department in connection with the

investigation into the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy.

They have readily furnished background information relative to the

activities of Sirhan Bishara Sirhan. According to our Los Angeles

Office, further inquiry into the Selective Service status of Saidallah

and Munir Sirhan could possibly have an adverse effect upon what

appears to be their cooperative spirit thus far.

Accordingly, the Department's advice is requested as to

whether we should proceed further with these possible Selective Service

violations at this time.

Attached hereto for approval is a letterhead memorandum

for the White House with copies for the Vice President and the Department 16>7

setting forth current developments in our continuing investigation of the

assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy.

Information contained in the personal effects of Sirhan Bishara

Sirhan indicated he was interested in the Rosicrucian Order (Ancient

Mystical Order Rosae Crucis, also known as AMORC), San Jose, California.

Inquiry with officials of this order reveals Sirhan filed an application in

June, 1966, and his membership subsequently became inactive due to his

failure to pay dues. His membership was reactivated upon payment of

dues in February, 1968.

Bureau files reveal the Rosicrucian Order is philosophical

in nature with religious implications and has never been investigated y us.

Officials of this order state it is a world-wide fraternal

organization operated on a lodge system. They claim it is nonsectarian

and is not a religious order although Christian principles are adhered tó.

They state that any law abiding citizensover 21 years of age, of good : spute,

and believing in a 'Supreme Being" are eligible for membership. Members

reportedly include a cross section of all classes of people and totai word

membership is claimed at approximately 90, 000 people, of which 45. 000

are in the United States. An official of this order states it trace: its origin

to the "mystery schools or secret schools" in Egypt approximate ig 1. 10

years B.C. The order requires that each member take an oath in su, port

of his country and the country in which he lives.

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach

Re: ASSASSINATION OF

SENATOR ROBERT F. KENNEDY

Although Sirhan is a corresponding member, we have learned

he did attend a meeting of the Pasadena, California, chapter on the

evening of 5-28-68. We are interviewing all persons who were in

attendance at that particular meeting.

The attached letterhead memorandum sets forth detailed

information concerning this order.

Local authorities obtained a search warrant and thereafter

searched Sirhan's automobile on 6-5-68. Among other items this search

revealed a sales receipt from the Lock, Stock and Barrel gun store,

san Gabriel, California, reflecting the purchase of four boxes of . 22

caliber ammunition on 6-1-68. Interviews with the gun store owner, his

wife and the salesman who allegedly sold Sirhan the ammunition have

resulted in several inconsistent statements. We are intensifying our

investigation into this phase.

ACTION:

If approved, the attached letterhead memorandum will be

forwarded to the White House, with copies to the Vice President, the

Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, Assistant Attorney

General Fred M. Vinson, Jr., and Assistant Attorney General Stephen J.

Pollak.

ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR

ROBERT F. KENNEDY

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

The continuing investigation concerning Sirhan Bishara

Sirhan has revealed that he is a member of the Rosicrucian Order,

San Jose, California. This order is also known as the Ancient

Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC).

An official of this organization has advised that Sirhan

had a "corresponding membership" and did not attend regular

meetings.

Several members of the Pasadena, California, chapter

of this order have advised that Sirhan attended a meeting at

Pasadena, California, on the evening of May 28, 1968.

Officials of the Rosicrucian Order have advised this

is a world-wide fraternal organization operating on a lodge system.

They advised it is nonsectarian and is not a religious order although

the ethics of the order adhere to Christian principles. They further

advised that the teachings of the organization do not interfere with

religious freedom of members and only law abiding citizens over

21 years of age, of good repute, and believing in a "Supreme Being"

are eligible for membership.

Members reportedly include a cross

section of all classes of people and total world membership is

claimed at approximately 90, 000 people of which 45, 000 axe in the

United States.

This order reportedly traces its origin back to the

"mystery schools or secret schools" in Egypt approximately

1500 years B.C., and is nonpolitical in nature.

On June 5, 1968, a search of Sirhan's automobile was

conducted by the Los Angeles, California, Police Department. This

search revealed a sales receipt from the Lock, Stock and Barrel

gun store, San Gabriel, California, reflecting the purchase of four

boxes of. 22 caliber ammunition on June 1, 1968. Intensive

inquiries are continuing into this as well as all other phases of this

investigation.

June 17, 1968

ASSASSINATION OF

SENATOR ROBERT F. KENNEDY

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

A United Press International release on June 13,

1968, indicated an unidentified Arab Government had passed

"new and startling" information to American officials rela-

tive to Sirhan Bishara Sirhan. It is reported by corres-

pondent John Kinche in the London Evening Standard that

• Sirhan

had traveled in the Middle East in 1964 for seven

months. He allegedly returned to the Middle East in 1966

spending five months

In Cairo, Egypt, before returning to

the United States in the beginning of 1967.

A Reuters dispatch

on June 13, 1968, additionally

reported that this individual's full name, according to

Kimche, was sirhan Bishara Sirhan Abu Khatar.

This indi-

vidual, according to the dispatch, was first brought to the

United

States in 1928 when he was four years old.

He was

allegedly married upon a return to the Middle East on

June 27, 1957, to Leila Ussef Mikhael at Es Salt, Jordan.

Records of the Immigration and Naturalization

Service show that Sirhan Bishara Sirhan entered the United

States on January 12, 1957. His date of birth was given

as March 19, 1944, Jerusalem, Jordan.

Investigation by our Los Angeles Office reveals

Muir High School in June, 1963. Thereafter he attended

Pasadena City College until May of 1965.

Investigation reveals that during 1964

Sirhan Bishara Sirhan was attending school and employed at

two pasadena, California, service stations.

Investigation

further Indicates that during 1966 he was continuously in

the Pasadena, California, area.

ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR ROBERT F. KENNEDY

In addition, each of Sirhan's four brothers was

interviewed by Special

Agents of the Los Angeles Office of

the FBI on June 13, 1968, at which time they advised Sirhan

has never left the United States since his arrival in 1957.

They pointed out that the word Abu Khatar, meaning "is the

father of Khatar," is a term not used by Christians and that

the Sirhan family is Christian.

The Department of State has advised that it has

received no communication from any country in the Middle

East relative to the aforementioned matter.

According to

the Department of State, information was received from the

a United Press International, Israel, to the effect that

American Embassy in Tel

correspondent had reportedly

talked with Sirhan's father in Jordan who stated that to

his knowledge Sirhan never married and the other details

contained in the original story of June 13, 1968, are

• highly improbable.

According to the Department of State an attempt

was made by that agency in London to contact Jon, also known

as John, Kinche with whom this story originated.

Kimche re-

fused to identily his source but reiterated his source is

usually reliable. According to the Department of State he

seemed umimpressed by the possibility this might be a simple

case of mistaken identity.

Kimche, according to the Central Intelligence

Agency, is an able, unscrupulous free lance journalist in

London who apparently supports official Israeli Zionist

lines in his work.

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach

RE: ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR

ROBERT F. KENNEDY

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

Witnesses to the assault have been interviewed and

several positively identified Sirhan Bishara Sirhan as the assailant.

Sirhan was subdued by two hotel employees, assisted by Roosevelt

Grier, professional football player, and Rafer Johnson, Olympic

decathlon champion.

Confusion existed immediately following shooting and

same situation prevailed at the emergency hospital where Kennedy

was first taken. He was thereafter taken to Good Samaritan Hospital

where brain surgery was performed and he expired at 1:44 a.m.,

6-6-68.

The Los Angeles Police Department has established

that the murder weapon was an eight-shot Iver Johnson . 22 caliber

revolver. All 8 cylinders in chamber contained expended cartridges.

One bullet removed from Kennedy determined to have been fired from

this revolver.

The Los Angeles Police Department furnished copy of

their initial interview with Sirhan which was taped. Sirhan repeatedly

advised of his rights by Los Angeles Police Department officers. The

interview appears to have been conducted in an appropriate manner

but it was totally unproductive and irrelevant.

No motive has been established for the killing beyond

the probative value deduced from literature which Sirhan possessed

and writings taken from his room which show he was deeply disturbed

concerning the relations between Arabs and Jews.

Considerable investigation has been conducted concerning

the background of Sirhan and his family, which consists of his mother

and four brothers, all of whom have resided in Pasadena, Calitornia,

area since they entered the United States. The father, the mother,

subject Sirhan, two brothers and a sister came to the United States in

1957. Two other brothers came to this country in 1960. Sirhan's

Sister died in 1960. Sirhan resides with his mother and three brothers

in house in Pasadena. His father currently resides in Jerusalem.

Memorandum to Mr. De Loach

RE: ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR

ROBERT F. KENNEDY

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

Sirhan attended Pasadena City schools, graduating from

high school in June, 1963. He entered Pasadena City College immediately

thereafter until his dismissal for poor scholastic record in May, 1965.

While attending Pasadena City College, he was employed

as a gas station attendant and subsequent to dismissal from school, he

was employed as an exercise boy for race horses and as clerk in a health

foods store.

During September, 1966, while employed as an exercise boy,

he fell off a horse, sustaining what doctors describe as minor injuries;

however, he was compensated in March, 1968, in the amount of $2, 000

for damages.

Relatives and some associates state following Sirhan's

accident there was a noticeable change in his demeanor.

Subject actually has few friends, no known girl friend and

is considered to be a "loner."

Report contains numerous references to the alleged girl

in the "polka dot dress." This refers to statements made by one

Sandra Serrano who was sitting on steps outside the Ambassador Hotel

when she heard sounds like 'backfire" and seconds later a man and a

woman ran down the stairs, the woman shouting "We shot him--We shot

him. " Serrano states that

prior to the shooting this woman and two men,

one of whom she identifies as Sirhan, entered the Ambassador Hotel via

the steps she was sitting on.

Identity of the girl in "polka dot dress" has not been

established and inconsistencies in Serrano's alleged observations are

set forth. Vigorous investigation continuing concerning this and any

other unresolved aspects of this case.

For your additional information, Sirhan was indicted on

6-7-68, on one count of murder and five counts of assault with a deadly

weapon with intent to commit murder and a hearing has been set for

6-28-68, at which time he is to enter a plea.

In connection with

our investigation into the

shooting of Senator Kennedy at the Ambassador Hotel in

Los Angeles, California,

on the night of June 4 - 5, 1968,

• 1968,

oi interest

is the fact

that we have located and inter-

was in the kitchen area waiting for the

viewed a college student by the name of Penator to ceo te

plete his speech.

As Senator Kennedy came into view approx-

imately ten to twelve feet from him he heard several shots

then

saw the Senator lying on the floor.

Grieco imnediately

knelt by him attempting to stop the bleeding with his hand

and according to Grieco, Kennedy asked him "Is Paul all

right? Is everybody all right?" He then apparently lapsed

into unconsciousness. Grieco did not see Sirhan Bishara

Sirhan the assailant until after attempting to comfort the

Senator and after Sirhan had been restrained.

Witnesses

have been located who have positively

identified Sirhan as being in the hotel area up to three

hours before the shooting.

The most recent, Judy Marie Royar,

private secretary to former California Governor Pat BrOWn,

while not observing the shooting, has positively identilled

Sirhan as an individual she had seen at approximately 10:00

o'clock in the vicinity of the Embassy Ballroom.

Our investigation has developed several instances

wherein individuals traveling abroad in Europe and the Middle

East between May 15 - 18, 1968, heard reports from various

sources of an alleged assassination of Senator Kennedy. These

reports appear to stem from erroneous releases from Buropean

news media at about that time.

We are currently conducting

investigation to obtain full facts with respect to this situa

tion and in particular we are attempting to pin down the origin

of this story.

Deputy Attorney General Warren Christopher called with

reference to captioned matter. He said he had received a call from

Deputy Chief of Police Robert A. Houghton. Houghton is handling the

special squad for the District Attorney's Office who has been investi-

gating this matter. Our office has worked closely with the District

Attorney's Office and the local police department.

c.ap

Christopher stated that Houghton had inquired as to whether

anything could be done to accelerate submission of the reports in this

matter. I advised Christopher that I had been in touch with Departmental

Attorney Lynch of the Criminal Division and had advised him that we

were hopeful to have the report in proper shape by Monday, June 17,

1968.

Christopher said that if there were any portions which he could

read,

he would appreciate being furnished them. I advised him that

the report wouldbe submitted in tot to the Department and that we

were working ongsome exhibits which we thought would be helpful in

submission of the reports. (These are photos being reproduced

which have been made from copies previously submitted. Such photo-

copies are much more readable.)

He also inquired as to whether any information or contact

with Central Intelligence Agency would be furnished. I advised him that

any information which we had received pertinent to this investigation

would be submitted to him. If the information was furnished by CIA and

was labeled "Secret, " it would have to be handled separately. (In this

connection," I am not aware of any information which falls into this

category..) I also advised him that if the information was from a

confidential source, we would not identify the source, but would furnist

the intormation. It was pointed out that if the disclosure of the informatior

would identify the source, that it would have to be properly labeled. In

any event, the report would contain the information which was pertinent

to this case.

Investigation is continuing in an effort to identify all individuals

who were at or near the scene of the shooting at the Ambassador Hotel on

the night of 6/4-5/68. We have located Rafer Johnson, Olympic champion,

who related how he assisted in subduing Sirhan immediately after the shots

were fired.. Johnson advises that as he held Sirhan in his grasp he put his

fist next to Sirhan's head and asked "Why did you do it" and repeated "Why

did you to it." Sirhan's only reply was "I'll explain it." Another witness

to the shooting identifies Sirhan as having queried him shortly before mid-

night as to the route Senator Kennedy was to take when he exited from the

stage.

Information has been received indicating Sirhan was allegedly

seen in the lobby of the Ambassador Hotel on 6/2/68 during a reception

for Senator Kennedy on that date. We are checking further into this aspect.

We are likewise making every effort to determine the full circumstances

surrounding the change in Kennedy's itinerary which took him through the

kitchen where he was shot instead of downstairs to the Ambassador Room

as originally planned.

Of note is the fact that confidential information made available

only to the FBI has been received from the Affairs Secretary of the

Governor's Office in California to the effect that a group of Arabs in

New York State have formed a committee to insure the United States Govern-

ment does not "railroad" Sirhan into prison. This group has attempted to

bring pressure on the Los Angeles Sheriff's Office through the Governor's

Office to insure that Sirhan's incoming mail is no longer screened.

The

Governor's Office in turntas advised this group that this is the responsi-

bility of the Sheriff's Office and has refused to intervene. Our Los Angeles

Office reiterated that this information was given in extreme confidence and

must not be disseminated.

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach

Re: Assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy

With respect to the unfounded United Press International release

of 6/13/68 relative to alleged travels abroad of Sirhan in 1964 and 1966,

we know this to be completely false since Sirhan was either employed or

going to school in Pasadena, California, at the time. A preliminary report

was given the White House late in the afternoon of 6/13/68 and we are

obtaining complete facts in order to furnish the White House a detailed

refutation to this press release.

Attached for approval is a memorandum setting forth current

developments. This will be disseminated to the White House, the Vice

President and the Department of Justice.

ASSASSINATION OF

SENATOR ROBERT E. KENNEDY

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

We are continuing interviews with individuals

who were at or near the scene of the shooting at the

ambassador hotel, Los Angeles, Calitornia, during the

evening of June 4-5, 1968, I0

an effort to establish

full facts relative to the activities of Sirhan Bishara

Sirhan.

Rafer Lewis Johnson, OLympic champion who

assisted in subduing Sirhan,

advises that while he was

holding Sirhan immediately after subduing him he held

his fist to Sirhan's head and repeated the question

"Why did you do it?" The assailant's only reply to

Johnson was "I'll explain it."

Another witness, Jesus Perez, saw Sirhan,

gun in band, immediately after Senator Kennedy had

been shot.

He stated Sirhan is identical with an

individual who talked to him briefly just before

midnight June 4, 1968, inquiring as to whether Senator

Kennedy would pass their way after his speech.

Investigation indicates that the itinerary

for Senator Kennedy was modified somewhat during the

evening of June 4, 1968, due to delays in receiving

election returns. According to information received

from Senator Kennedy's Public Relations Director for

the California Campaign, the decision to take the

route directly to the Colonial Room at the Ambassador

Hotel was made on the stage immediately. after Senator

Kennedy's speech. Inquiry into this phase is continuing.

This information allegedly originated with an

The attached teletype from our Los Angeles Office summarizes

1621

recent investigation into the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy,

setting forth the results of interviews with former associates, employers

and witnesses to the shooting of Senator Kennedy. Roosevelt Grier, pro-

fessional football player, has been interviewed and relates his part in

helping to disarm Sirhan Bishara Sirhan. Another associate of Sirhan's

who recently conversed with Sirhan described him as extremely frustrated

..

with respect to the so-called "Zionist plots" and states Sirhan is convinced

the United States is involved in the furtherance of the Zionist goals.

With respect to Sandra Serrano, a 20-year-old girl who insists

she saw a female in a polka dot dress run from the scene of the shooting

shouting "We shot him - we shot him, " Serrano has now obtained an

attorney and will not be interviewed by authorities unless that attorney is

present. The Los Angeles Police Department does not contemplate further

interview with Serrano and considers her story of no value to this investi-

gation because of inconsistencies. The Los Angeles prosecutor's office is

of the firm opinion that investigation has failed to indicate any evidence to

support Sirhan was associated with anyone in a conspiracy.

Wilbur Littlefield, in the office of the Public Defender, Los

Angeles, has been named to represent Sirhan although press reports

indicate Sirhan desires private attorneys but cannot afford them.

ACTION:

Attached for dissemination to the White House with copies to the

Vice President and the Department of Justice if approved is a brief summary

of recent developments in our investigation.

ASSASSINATION OF

SENATOR ROBERT F. KENNEDY

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

Interviews with witnesses into the shooting of

Senator Robert F. Kennedy continue, as well as interviews

with associates and former employers of the accused assail-

ant Sirhan Bishara Sirhan. Approximately 207 employees of

the Ambassador Hotel have

been interviewed to date.

Roosevelt Grier, professional football player

who was present at Senator Kennedy's speech in the

Ambassador Hotel at Los Angeles, California, during the

night of June 4, 1968, related to fBl Agents how he, with

the assistance of hotel employees and Rafer Johnson, Olympic

Champion,

disarmed Sirhan after the shooting. Another

individual, Louis Shelby, a restaurant owner where Adel Sirhan

had been employed, described the assailant as an extremely

frustrated individual and one who was convinced the United

States was involved in the furtherance of Zionist goals.

Chief Deputy District Attorney, Los Angeles County,

Lynn Compton, has advised our Los Angeles Office that a review

Di investigation conducted by the investigative stage de the o

District Attorney's office

and the Los Angeles Police Depart-

ment fails to indicate that there is any evidence to support

Sirhan was associated with anyone else or conspired with any

other person in the assassination of Senator Kennedy.

With respect to the prosecution oi sirhan, it has

been reported that Mr. Wilbur Littlefield, Chief Trial Deputy

in the Office of the

Public Detender, has

been named to

represent Sirhan.

The news media indicates Sirhan reportedly

desires two private. attorneys to defend him but alleged he

has stated he could not afford to retain private counsel.

Littlefield was placed in charge of the case after a meeting

of the Los Angeles Bar Association.

by FBI Agents and Los Angeles

police oificers in a search of Sirhan Bishara Sirhan's room.

Of significance is one statement that

"Robert I. Kennedy must ba assassinated before 5 June 68."

House briefly sets forth results of additional inquiries

into Sirhan's background, interviews with his brothers and

ASSASSINATION OF

SENATOR ROBERT F. KENNEDY

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

Intensive investigation is continuing in order to determine the

complete circumstances surrounding the shooting of Senator Robert F.

Kennedy by an individual who has been charged by Los Angeles,

California, authorities as his assailant, Sirhan Bishara Sirhan.

School records in Pasadena, California, described Sirhan prior

to 1963 when he graduated from John Muir High School as "friendly, co-

operative, well mannered, has adjusted very nicely to his new environ-

ment and making many new friends. " Continuing investigation into Sirhan's

background indicates, according to his brother Sharif Bishara Sirhan, the

assailant had little association or communication with the rest of the

family. He had few male associates and since his fall from a horse in

September, 1966, had been more withdrawn.

The FBI Laboratory has conducted an examination of the hand-

writing appearing on papers found after a search of Sirhan's room in the

Pasadena family home which bore notations advocating the overthrow of

the President of the United States and other statements alluding to the

necessity of assassinating Robert F. Kennedy. The handwriting could not

be identified as Sirhan's because of the lack of adequate known handwriting

samples. Additional samples of Sirhan's known handwriting are being.

obtained for comparison purposes.

A copy of this material is attached.

Investigation is continuing in an effort to account for Sirhan's

activities directly prior to the shooting of Senator Kennedy. Individuals

who were in attendance at the ballroom in the Ambassador Hotel at the

time of the shooting are being located and interviewed in detail. Two

witnesses, Humphrey Cordero and Enrique Rabago, identified Sirhan as

being at the Ambassador Hotel at approximately 9:30 p.m., Pacific

Daylight Time, on June 4, 1968, at which time Sirhan is alleged to have

made derogatory comments regarding "rich people" in general and

Senator Kennedy in particular. It was alleged Sirhan stated that

Senator Kennedy was going to 'buy the presidency" for personal purposes,

and that he (Sirhan) was looked down upon because of his clothing. Both

Cordero and Rabago were of the opinion based on their conversation with

firhan that he had come to the Ambassador Hotel alone since no one

appeared to be accompanying him during their approximate ten-minute

conversation with him.

Three of the five individuals who were wounded during the

shooting were interviewed, but none observed the assailant. The remain-

ing two who were more seriously wounded will be interviewed as soon as

their condition permits.

Mayor Samuel W. Yorty, Los Angeles, California, was reported

the W. E. B. DuBois Clubs of America. The Los Angeles Police Depart-

ment advised that on January 16, 1966, a vehicle registered to Sirhan's

brother Adel was observed in the vicinity of Baces Hall, Sunset and

Vermont, Los Angeles, California, where a meeting sponsored by the

W. E. B.-DuBois Clubs ot America was being held.

FBI files based on available data failed to establish Sirhan was

a member of such an organization.

A reliable source has indicated that Dorothy Healy, Los Angeles

Communist Party leader, has stated the assassin is unknown as a member

of the W. E. B. DuBois Clubs of America in the Los Angeles area. The

W. E. B. DuBois Clubs of America is a Marxist-orientated youth organi-

zation whose leaders in 1967 were Communist Party, United States of

America, members. It was indicated that the Communist Party, United

States of America, intends to issue a press release denying Sirhan has

had any connection with the Communist Party and, in fact, is considering

a legal suit against Mayor Yorty with respect to his allegations.

ASSASSINATION OF

SENATOR ROBERT F. KENNEDY

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

Investigation is continuing in order to develop

full background information concerning Sirhan Bishara

Sirhan as well as that of members of his immediate family

and associates.

With respect to a previous statement attributed

to mayor Samuel W. Yorty, Los Angeles, California, as

reported by the news media on June 6,

1968, alleging

Sirhan was associated with the W. E. B. DuBois Clubs of

America, and a vehicle registered to Sirhan's brother,

Adel, was observed on January 16, 1966, in the vicinity

of Baces Hall, 1528 North Vermont, Los Angeles, California,

where a meeting sponsored by that organization was being

held, information has been developed indicating Adel Sirhan

had previously been employed as a musician at the Fez Res-

taurant, 1508 North Vermont, adjacent to Baces Hall. Full

details

are being developed with respect to this phase of

our investigation.

On June 9, 1968, a United Press International

release datelined Cairo made reference to the arrest of

one Soliman Sirhan by Iragi authorities as an Israeli spy

alleging he was a brother of Sirhan Bishara Sirhan. Sirhan's

mother, during an intensive interview by FBI Agents on June 10,

1968, volunteered she had heard this newscast and stated she

has only five sons, Sirhan, Munir, Sharif, Adel and Saidallab,

none of whom are living outside the United States. The

individual to whom the United Press International referred

was unknown to her.

Interviews are continuing with those individuals

who were in or near the Embassy Room at the Ambassador

Hotel during the evening of June 4-5, 1968. Several have

NW 54999 Docid: 32989522 Page 216

## Page 217

ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR

ROBERT F. KENNEDY

been located who were witnesses to the shooting of

Senator Robert F. Kennedy and who positively identify

Sirhan Bishara Sirhan as the individual who fired the

shots at Senator Kennedy.

This phase of our investiga-

tion is being exhaustively pursued.

According to information furnished by ambulance

attendant Max Alma Behrmann, after responding to the call

at the Ambassador Hotel, a distraught Mrs. Kennedy attempted

to keep him from assisting the Senator stating "Keep your

hands off him, I'm Mrs. Kennedy." As the Senator was placed

in an ambulance, an argument ensued between Behrmann and

Mrs. Kennedy as

to who would accompany the ambulance and

again, according to Behrmann, when he questioned Mrs. Kennedy

while

en route to the hospital as to what

had transpired, she

stated "I don't give a damn what you say," grabbed his record

book and threw it out of the ambulance.

Upon noting the

Senator was having difficulty breathing and thereafter trying

to assist him, Behrmann was told by Mrs. Kennedy "You keer

your dirty filthy hands off my husband," and she struck him

on the right side of his face stunning him. He further recalls.

Mrs. Kennedy called to a male associate who was sitting in the

front seat to "Come back here and throw this ambulance man out;

he's bothering me; he's asking too many questions."

It was further reported by a witness at the hospital

that upon arrival there Mrs. Kennedy grabbed a camera from a

newsman, knocking it to the floor, and she also swung at the

newsman

hitting him in the chest area.

bodyguard then jumped over the stretcher and punched the

newsman in the face.

Of possible significance is the fact that among

items found on Sirhan's person when taken into custody was

a newspaper article by David Lawrence captioned "Paradoxical

Bob" and highlighting the fact that while Kennedy vigorously

opposes the war in Vietnam, he has nevertheless recommended

full assistance to Israel "with arms if necessary" to meet

the threat of the Soviets..

In addition, whereas press reports claim Rafer Johnson,

Olympic Champion, and

Roosevelt Grier, professional football

player, subdued the assailant, investigation reveals the first

to reach the assailant were two. hotel employees. They then

were assisted by Grier and Johnson.

There is attached for approval a memorandum for the White

House with copies for the Vice President and the Department dealing with

current developments in our investigation of the assassination of

Senator Robert F. Kennedy.

In summary, we indicate our investigation is continuing into

all aspects of this matter. We refer to the fact that Mayor Samuel W.

Yorty, Los Angeles, California, claimed Sirhan Bishara Sirhan was

associated with the W. E. B. DuBois Clubs of America. Yorty's release

to the press on 6-6-68 identified an automobile belonging to Sirhan's

brother, Adel, as having been parked in the vicinity of Baces Hall when

a meeting of the above group was in session. We point out that Adel is

reported to have been employed as a musician at a restaurant directly

adjacent to Baces Hall. In addition, we comment on the fact that Sirhan's

mother definitely states the individual mentioned by United Press Inter-

national, Soliman Sirhan, reportedly an Israeli spy currently under arrest, *

is not, as indicated by United Press International, her son and brother of

the subject. The individual arrested was unknown to her.

Additional information not reported in the attached memorandum

is as follows:

An investigative report totaling 1, 082 pages was received from

our Los Angeles Office on 6-10-68. It is currently being intensively

reviewed. Investigation would indicate that immediately follöwing the

after responding to the call at the Ambassador Hotel, a distraught

Mrs. Kennedy attempted to keep him from assisting the Senator stating

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach

Re: Assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy

"Keep your hands off him, I'm Mrs. Kennedy. " As the Senator was placed

in an ambulance, an argument ensued between Behrmann and Mrs. Kennedy

as to who would accompany the ambulance and again, according to

Behrmann, when he questioned Mrs. Kennedy while en route to the hospital

as to what had transpired, she stated "I don't give a damn what you say,"

grabbed his record book and threw it out of the ambulance. Upon noting

the Senator was having difficulty breathing and thereafter trying to assist

him, Behrmann was told by Mrs. Kennedy "You keep your dirty filthy

hands off my husband, " and she struck him on the right side of his face

stunning him. He further recalls Mrs. Kennedy called to a male associate

who was sitting in the front seat to "Come back here and throw this ambu-

lance man out; he's bothering me; he's asking too many questions. "

It was further reported by a witness at the hospital that upon

arrival there Mrs. Kennedy grabbed a camera from a newsman, knocking

it to the floor, and she also swung at the newsman hitting him in the chest

area. Senator Kennedy's bodyguard, former FBI Agent Bill Barry, then

jumped over the stretcher and punched the newsman in the face.

Of possible significance is the fact that among items found on

Sirhan's person when taken into custody was a newspaper article by

David Lawrence captioned "Paradoxical Bob" and highlighting the fact

that while Kennedy vigorously opposes the war in Vietnam, he has

nevertheless recommended full assistance to Israel "with arms if necessary"

to meet the threat of the Soviets.

In addition, whereas press reports claim Rafer Johnson, Olympic

champion, and Roosevelt Grier, professional football player, subdued the

assailant, review of Los Angeles report would indicate the first to reach

the assailant were two hotel employees. They then were assisted by Grier

and Johnson.

ACTION: (1) If approved, the attached memorandum will be forwarded to

the White House with copies to the Vice President, the Attorney General,

the Deputy Attorney General and the Civil Rights Division of the Department.

(2) Additional memoranda will be prepared for dissemination to

the White House upon the development of significant details.

ASSASSINATION OF

SENATOR ROBERT F. KENNEDY

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

Investigation is continuing in order to develop

full background information concerning Sirhan Bishara

Sirhan as well as that of members of his inmediate family

and associates.

With respect to a previous statement attributed

to Mayor Samuel W. Yorty, Los Angeles, California, as

reported by the news media on June 6, 1968, alleging

Sirhan was associated with the W.

E. B. DuBois Clubs of

America, and a vehicle registered to Sirhan's brother,

adel, was observed on January 16, 1966, in the vicinity

si Baces Hall, 1528 North Vermont, Los angeles, CaLitornia,

where a meeting sponsored by that

organization was being

held,

information has been developed indicating Adel Sirhan

had previously been employed as a musician at the Fez Res-

taurant, 1508 North Vermont, adjacent to Baces Hall. Full

details are being developed

with respect to this phase of

our investigation.

On June 9, 1968, a United Press International

release datelined Cairo made reference to the arrest of

one Soliman Sirhan by Iraqi authorities as an Israeli spy

alleging he was a brother of Sirhan Bishara Sirhan. Sirban's

mother, during an intensive interview by FBI Agents on June 10,

1968, volunteered she had heard this newscast and stated she

has only five sons, Sirhan, Munir, Sharif, Adel and Saidallah,

none of whom are living outside the United States. The

individual to whom the United Press International referred

was unknown to her.

Interviews are continuing with those individuals

who were in or near the Embassy Room at the Ambassador

Hotel during the evening of June 4-5, 1968. Several bave

been located who were witnesses to the shooting of

Senator Robert f. Kennedy and who positively identity

Sirhan Bishara Sirhan as the individual who fired the

shots at Senator Kennedy. This phase of our investi

gation is being exhaustively pursued.

Additional significant developments will be

reported as they occur.

In connection with our investigation into the

assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, there is attached

for approval a memorandum for the White House with copies for

the Vice President and the Department.

In summary, we indicate interviews with individuals

in the area have determined that Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, who

has been charged by local authorities as the assailant, was

seen alone in the Ambassador ball room immediately prior to

the shooting. One witness viewed the actual shooting. It

was further determined that Sirhan earlier in the evening on

June 4, 1968, met a casual acquaintance and gave no indication

during

this meeting that he planned such an act. Results of

our interview with a Communist Party member, an acquaintance

of Sirban, is also set forth.

This individual, Walter S. Crowe, JX.,

unequivocally states Sirhan was not a Communist Party member.*

Additional facts relative to the so-called girl in the polka

dot dress are likewise set forth as well as the results of

the Los Angeles Police Department's ballistics tests which

show that the murder gun fired the lethal bullets found in

Senator Kennedy's body from a distance of from 2" to 6".

Facts relating to the order by the Superior Court in Los

Angeles prohibiting the release of statements, documents,

exhibits or evidence are also reported.

Of significance is the fact investigation indicates

Sirhan was seen taking target practice at the San Gabriel

cun Club, Duarte, California, on June 4, last.

This information

is set forth in the attached

memorandum.

Two otber individuals

were seen at the gun club.

One an unidentified female, husky

build, shoulder-length blond hair, and an unidentified

male

companion were at the range at the same time. The range officer

indicated Sirhan and the female may possibly have been acquainted.

This phase of our investigation is being pressed vigorously and

under the circumstances, because of the incomplete facts on hand,

information relating to

the other individuals at the range does

the ouse

not appear in the attached memorandum.

ASSASSINATION OF

SENATOR ROBERT F. KENNEDY

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

In our continuing investigation to trace the activities of Sirhan

Bishara Sirhan immediately prior to the shooting of Senator Robert F.

Kennedy, several witnesses have been located who observed Sirhan in

the ballroom of the Ambassador Hotel moments prior to the assault.

One witness, Edward Minasian, employee at the Ambassador Hotel,

observed the actual shooting. None of the witnesses interviewed observed

Sirhan in the company of any other individual.

A casual acquaintance of Sirhan's, Gaymoard Mistri, Pasadena,

California, when interviewed related he had a chance meeting with Sirhan

at approximately 6:10 p. m., Pacific Daylight Time, on June 4, 1968, at

a Pasadena restaurant. He claimed to have been with Sirhan until approxi-

mately 7:30 p. m., Pacific Daylight Time. During this period, Sirhan

gave no indication whatsoever of his intentions to commit the action that

followed several hours later. In fact, he invited Mistri to engage in a

game of pool and gave no indication that there would be a time limit or

that he had a subsequent engagement.

Walter S. Crowe, Jr., an admitted member of the Communist

Party, acknowledged an acquaintanceship with Sirhan, having last been

in contact with him on May 2, 1968. Crowe stated Sirhan was not a

member of the W. E. B. DuBois Clubs of America nor was he a member

of the Communist Party. Crowe considered Sirhan "erratic" in his

political philosophy since he politically favored movements that are con-

sidered by the general populace to be left of center; however, definite

phases of his thinking were to the right of center, particularly on the

subject of the State of Israel.

It has been reported by the Los Angeles, California, Police

Department that a ballistic examination has proven that the bullet removed

from Senator Kennedy's head had definitely been fired by the murder

weapon at a distance from two to six inches.

ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR ROBERT F. KENNEDY

Information was developed by our Los Angeles Office to the

effect that Sirhan has been identified as engaging in target practice with

a. 22 caliber pistol on June 4, 1968, at the San Gabriel Valley Gun Club,

Duarte, California.

Sandra Serrano, aged 20, who appeared on television imme-

diately after the shooting was interviewed in detail relative to her state-

ment that she heard shots and then saw a man and woman running from

the scene of the shooting. According to Serrano, as the woman who wore

a polka-dot dress ran by her she yelled "We shot him - we shot him." An

on-the-scene examination of the area in the presence of Serrano indicates

she was across the ballroom at least 140 feet from the scene of the shoot-

ing and at the time there were approximately 1, 500 people in the ballroom.

Detective C. J. Hughes, Los Angeles Police Department, advised in his

opinion it would have been physically impossible to hear a . 22 caliber

pistol being fired at a location where Serrano claims to have been,

pointing out many other individuals much closer to the shooting who were

inside the ballroom had not heard the shots. This phase of our investi-

gation is continuing.

On June 7, 1968, Judge Arthur L. Alarcon, Superior Court,

Los Angeles, California, issued an order prohibiting the release of any

extra judicial statements, documents, exhibits or evidence so as to

insure there be no interference with the constitutional right of Sirhan to

a fair trial.

June 7, 1968

ASSASSINATION OF

SENATOR ROBERT F. KENNEDY

LOS ANGELES,

CALIFORNIA

Intensive investigation is continuing in order to determine the

complete circumstances surrounding the shooting of Senator Robert F.

Kennedy by an individual who has been charged by Los Angeles,

California, authorities as'his assailant, Sirhan Bishara Sirhan.

School records in Pasadena, California, described Sirhan prior

: to 1963 when he graduated from John Muir High School as "friendly, co-

operative, well mannered, has adjusted very nicely to his new environ-

ment and making many new friends. " Continuing investigation into Sirhan's

background indicates, according to his brother Sharif Bishara Sirhan, the

assailant had little association or communication with the rest of the

family. He had few male associates and since his fall from a horse in

September, 1966, had been more withdrawn.

The FBI Laboratory has conducted an examination of the hand- -

-

writing appearing on papers found after a search of Sirhan's room in the

Pasadena family home which bore notations advocating the overthrow of

the President of the United States and other statements alluding to the

necessity of assassinating Robert F. Kennedy. The handwriting could not

be identified as Sirhan's because of the lack of adequate known handwriting

samples. Additional samples of Sirhan's known handwriting are being

obtained for comparison purposes.

A copy of this material is attached.

Investigation is continuing in an effort to account for Sirhan's

activities directly prior to the shooting of Senator Kennedy. Individuals

who were in attendance at the ballroom in the Ambassador Hotel at the

time of the shooting are being located and interviewed in detail. Two

NW 54999 DocId: 32989522 Page 243

ASSASSINATION OF SENATOR ROBERT F. KENNEDY

witnesses, Humphrey Cordero and Enrique Rabago, identified Sirhan as

being at the Ambassador Hotel at approximately 9:30 p. m., Pacitic

Daylight Time, on June 4, 1968, at which time Sirhan is alleged to have

made derogatory comments regarding "rich people" in general and

Senator Kennedy in particular. It was alleged Sirhan stated that

Senator Kennedy was going to 'buy the presidency" for personal purposes,

and that he (Sirhan) was looked down upon because of his clothing. Both •

Cordero and Rabago were of the opinion based on their conversation with

Sirhan that he had come to the Ambassador Hotel alone since no one •

appeared to be accompanying him during their approximate ten-minute

conversation with him.

Three of the five individuals who were wounded during the

shooting were interviewed, but none observed the assailant. The remain-

ing two who were more seriously wounded will be interviewed as soon as

their condition permits.

Mayor Samuel W. Yorty, Los Angeles, California, was reported

, the W. E. B. DuBois Clubs of America. The Los Angeles Police Depart-

ment advised that on January 16, 1966, a vehicle registered to Sirhan's

• brother Adel was observed in the vicinity of Baces Hall, Sunset and

Vermont, Los Angeles, California, where a meeting sponsored by the

W. E.-B. DuBois Clubs of America was being held.

FBI files based on available data failed to establish Sirhan was

a member of such an organization.

A reliable source has indicated that Dorothy Healy, Los Angeles

Communist Party leader, has stated the assassin is unknown as a member

.of the W. E. B. DuBois Clubs of America in the Los Angeles area. The

W. E. B. DuBois Clubs of America is a Marxist-orientated youth organi-

zation whose leaders in 1967 were Communist Party, United States of

America, members. It was indicated that the Communist Party, United

States of America, intends to issue a press release denying Sirhan has

had any connection with the Communist Party and, in fact, is considering

a legal suit against Mayor Yorty with respect to his allegations.

FBI Agents, on June 5, 1968, located a 1956 DeSoto registered

to Sirhan Sirhan at Wilshire Boulevard and New Hampshire Avenue a few

blocks from the Ambassador Hotel. An examination of this vehicle, after

a search warrant was obtained, resulted in the location of one empty box

of. 22 caliber bullets in the glove compartment. In addition,.

a sales

receipt was located in the glove compartment showing the purchase of

four boxes of . 22 caliber bullets for $3. 99 paid for in cash on June 1, 1968.

A wallet containing identification in the name of Sirhan Sirhan was also

located in the glove compartment.

Our Los Angeles Office has advised that a telephone call was

received from one Ronald R. Huntley,, 2902 Last Burnside, Portland,

Oregon, this morning. Huntley stated that he saw a picture of Kennedy's

assailant on television this morning and recalled that he had seen this

same individual in Portland, Oregon. According to Huntley, after the

votes had been tabulated on the evening of 5-28-68 Senator Kennedy visited

Senator McCarthy's campaign headquarters at the Benson Hotel, Portland.

A crowd was around Senator Kennedy and Huntley says that the individual

whose picture was on television this morning was very close to Kennedy

and, in fact, he (Huntley) pushed this individual away from Kennedy. At

the time he did this he felt an object on this individual which he

dor the police department.

a pistol. Huntley did not report this to Senator Kennedy, any of his stares

Huntley states that the individual whom he describes as Kennedy's

assailant was accompanied by another individual described as of Latin

appearance, 5'4" tall, stocky build, 23 to 25 years of age, and with dark

brown hair. Our Portland Office has been instructed to immediately inter-

view Huntley and obtain full details concerning his alleged observations.

All facets of this phase of the investigation will be completely checked out.

Our Los Angeles Office has been instructed to conduct an all-out

investigation into this matter and upon identifying the subject, to completely

check out every bit of his background. Instructions were also issued to

begin the preparation of a comprehensive report concerning our investi-

gation; however, in the interim the Bureau should be kept advised of all

pertinent developments by telephone followed by teletype confirmation.

Our Los Angeles Office has arranged with the telephone company

to have a direct line to the hospital where Kennedy is confined so that we

will be aware of any changes in his condition or prognosis.

Re: Attempted Assassination of

Senator Robert F. Kennedy

The 1958 Chrysler registered to Robert Gene Gendroz will be

thoroughly processed for physical as well as fingerprint evidence; however,

the local police desire to obtain a search warrant prior to conducting any

examination. They are attempting to contact a magistrate to obtain the

search warrant. Any pertinent evidence developed from an examination of

this car will be flown to. our Laboratory for examination. There is no stolen

report on this car in the Los Angeles area.

Pierre Salinger called the office and advised that Senator Kennedy

is out of surgery, the extent of his injuries will not be known for a couple of

I days; however, the doctors are optimistic.

OCT -- 5 1977

MEMORANDUM OPINION

'AMES F. DAVEY, Clert

This matter is 'before the Court on 'defendahts' motion for summary

judgment. Plaintiff has brought suit under the Freedom

of Information Act

("FOIA"') to obtain materials relating to scientific and ballistics tests

alleged to have been performed on items of evidence in the assassination of

President John F. Kennedy. 5 U.S.C. 8 552(b)(7) (Supp. V 1975). The

defendants are the United States Department of Justice, to which plaintiff

has directed his requests for laboratory records of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation, and the United States Energy Research and Development Adminis-

tration ("'ERDA"), to which plaintiff has directed requests for records of

the Atomic Energy Conmission ("'AEC"), ERDA's predecessor agency.

ERDA's responses to plaintiff's interrogatories indicate that the

AEC's role in the investigation of the assassination of President

Kennedy was limited to making its reactor facilities at Oak

Ridge, Tennessee, available for FBI tests on assassination

evidence.

Although the Government's subnissions to the plaintiff have been

voluminous; plaintiff maintains that much of

what he has received

was

unsought, and that much of what he has sought has not been tendered to him.

The Government's position, on the other hand, remains, first, that it has

complied fully with plaintiff's requests'as to materials extant, and second,

that it cannot possibly comply with the remaining requests because the

materials sought do not exist.

In

moving for summary judgment, the Government bears the burden

of demonstrating

that no genuine issue of material fact impedes its right

to judgment as a matter of law.

BACKGROUND OF THE ACTION.

Plaintiff's initial quest for

scientific investigatory data related

to the assassination of President, Kennedy was frustrated in the courts on

the ground

that the data sought lay within the purview of FOIA exemption

seven, covering investigative matter. Weisberg.v. United States Department

of Justice, 160 U.S. App. D.C. 71, 489 F.2d 1195 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (en banc),

cert. denied, 416 U.S. 993 (1974); see Act of June 5, 1967, Pub. I. No.

90-23, $ 1, 81 Stat. 54 (current version at 5 U.S.C. $ 552(b) (7) (Supp. V

1975)). Congress subsequently narrowed the scope of exemption seven, and

plaintiff renewed his requests. Act of Nov. 21, 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-502,

$ 2, 88 Stat. 1563, amending 5 U.S.C. § 552(b) (7) (1970). On July 15, 1975,

this Court dismissed the action as moot, and plaintiff took an appeal.

the United

States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia

Circuit reversed, and remanded for further

proceedings.

Weisberg v. United

States Department of Justice, 177 U.S. App. D.C. 161, 543 F.2d 308 (D:C.

Cir. 1976). The Court of Appeals identified five categories of investiga-

tive tests as to which plaintiff had made demands "which raise material

factual questions still' in dispute." • Id. at 163, 543 F.28 at 310. As the

Court of Appeals noted, however, there remain other categories of tests,

such as the microscopic

examinations perforned on certain items of evidence,

as to which plaintiff asserts his requests have not evoked satisfactory

response. Id. at 164, 543 F.2d at 311. These categories, as well as the

five enumerated in the Court of Appeals opinion, must figure in considera-

tion of the motion for summary judgment. 'In addition to identifying several

of the factual areas

to be explored

on remand, the Court of Appeals specified

an exploratory technique, namely the taking

of

the testimony, by deposition

or otherwise, with an opportunity for cross-examination in any case, of

the

individuals who actually conducted the tests,

the results of which plaintiff

• has requested. Id. at 163, 164, 543 F.2d at 310, 311.

In February and March, 1977, plaintiff took the depositions of

four former and present employees of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

laboratory, all of whom worked directly with evidence associated with the

assassination. The four are Robert A. Frazier, employed as a special agent

in the laboratory's firearms and toolmarks unit during the investigation of

the assassination, and retired from the FBI

as of April 1975; John F.

Gallagher, assigned to the laboratory's spectrographic unit during the

investigation, and retired as of January 1975; Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt,

assigned as a documents examiner and photographic specialist for the

laboratory between 1955 and 1975, when he retired from the Bureau; and

Cortlandt Cunningham, formerly a special agent supervisor in the firearms

and toolmarks unit during the investigation, and presently chief of the

unit. Frazier and Cunninghan were deposed February 24, 1977, and Gallagher

and Shaneyfelt were deposed March 28, 1977. At each deposition save that

of former Special Agent Gallagher, examination was by plaintiff's counsel

only, with occasionally interposed objections from counsel for the

defendants. At a hearing March 30, 1977, counsel for plaintiff indicated

that no further depositions of FBI employees who had participated in the

2/

Bureau's investigation were planned.

Weisberg v. United States Department

•of Justice, No. 75-226, II. at 4 (D.D.C.. March 30, 1977). These representa-

tions controvert the suggestion in an affidavit of the plaintiff that

"[this Court refused me the depositions my counsel and I consider necessary

to meet what I regard as the mandate of the court of appeals: . ."

Affidavit of Harold Weisberg " 165, at 34 (July 28,

1977) [hereinafter

"Weisberg Affidavit"]. Read broadly, the mandate of the. Court of Appeals

was to

resolve whether the data sought exist on "the basis of the best

available evidence, f.e., the witnesses who had personal knowledge of

events

at the time the investigation was made." 177 U.S. App. D.C. at 164,

543 F.2d at 311. Plaintiff has not sought to depose any such witness other

than the four whose depositions were taken.

To borrow the metaphor employed

by the Court of Appeals in its opinion above, the legal engine of cross-

examination has done its work on plaintiff's behalf with respect to witnesses

with direct knowledge of the FBI investigation into the President's assassi-

nation. 177 U.S. App. D.C. at 164, 543 F.2d at 311. The issue devolves

to what the evidence adduced in the four depositions establishes, and thence

to whether there now remains a genuine issue as

to whether the Government

has complied with the strictures of the FOIA.

II. THE EVIDENCE ADDUCED.

The testimony of all four deponents related

not only to specific

pieces

assassination evidence and the tests performed, or not

performed,

upon them,

but also

to the procedures, and occasionally lack of procedures,

employed

in those sections of

the FBI laboratory with which the deponents

2

Counsel had previously indicated he planned to depose plaintiff,

an employee of the National Archives, which has custody of the

evidence involved, and an FBI special agent who had not parti-

• cipated in the investigation but whose affidavit had constituted

part of

the Government's response to plaintiff's request.

NW 54999 DocId: 32989522 Page 267

were familiar. These laboratory procedures bear significantly on the

question whether much of the material plaintiff seeks exists:

• Laboratory Procedures. The laboratory's Scientific Analysis

Section, was known at the time of the investigation as the Physics and

Chemistry Section; then, as now, the section comprised

several disparate

units, including the firearms and toolmarks unit, and the spectrographic

unit, which in 1963-64 was responsible for both emissions spectrography

and neutron activation analysis. Cunningham Deposition, at 4-5. During

the investigation of the 'Presidential assassination,'investigating agencies

in the field--the Dallas Police Department, the Secret Service, and the

FBI--forwarded the evidence to the FBI laboratory, in some instances directly

to the firearms and toolmarks unit. ' Frazier Deposition, 'at 5, 7-8;

Cunningham Deposition, at 8. Ordinarily, the evidence would be

accompanied

by a statement of the matters sought to be ascertained through laboratory

testing, as, for example, the presence of gunpowder

on a piece of

evidence.

Frazier Deposition, at 6, 8. The decision as

to the specific tests

to be

conducted, however, was made within the laboratory. Id. at 8-9; Cunningham

Deposition, at 8-9; Gallagher Deposition, at 26-27. The decisionmaking

process as to which tests would be appropriate apparently was highly

informal: in some cases, Frazier, the laboratory examiner with direct

responsibility for the Physics and Chemistry Section's efforts in the

investigation, conferred with his superiors on the tests to be performed,

Cunningham Deposition, at 8-9, and in others, he and the individual

examiners who would conduct the tests conferred

on which tests to perform.

Frazier Deposition, at 8; Gallagher Deposition, at

27.

In still other

instances, if

the individual examiner determined

that tests

outside his

domain were called for, he and

his supervisor

Frazier, in most

cases)

would

approach

examiners

in the other units with jurisdiction over the

requisitetype of testing. Cunningham Deposition, at 10; Frazier Deposition,

at 8-9; Shaneyfelt Deposition, at 14. Only rarely were these conferences

on tests to be performed recorded in communications between the conferees,

NW 54999

DocId: 32989522

Page 268

---

## Page 269

- 6-

or in notes made by one of them. Cunningham Deposition, at 10; Frazier

Deposition, at 8-9; Gallagher Deposition; at 27-28.

The tests determined

to be appropriate for a given item of

physical evidence typically were conducted by examiners working individually,

or under

the direct

supervision of the individual examiner. Cunningham

Deposition, at 10; Frazier t

Deposition, at 10. Three examiners in the

firearms and toolmarks unit collaborated on the testing within that unit,

all three having been present during all tests conducted by the unit on

assassination evidence, save a velocity test. Cunningham Deposition, at 53.

Several examiners tested items of evidence in the spectrography unit,

although they appear to have worked separately. Gallagher Deposition, at

7, 35-37..

Just as there was no established procedure for deciding which

tests were to be performed

on a particular

item of

evidence, there was no

requirement that test results

be expressed

in a particular format, or

expressed

at all if the results were insignificant.

In most instances,.

the

examiner

performing a test took notes during the testing.

Cunningham

Deposition, at 11; Frazier Deposition, at 10; Gallagher Deposition, at 38.

However, all deponents testified to not having made notes on results they

deemed insignificant or insufficiently reliable. Cunningham, for

example,

testified to his practice of making notes on a weapon's operating

condition

only if the weapon was not in normal working order. Cunningham Deposition,

at 21. Gallagher explained the absence of

observation data in a neutron

activation analysis folder by suggesting that he might have skipped the

step of noting down the readings and done the tabulations in his head.

Gallagher Deposition, at 61-62. He indicated

later that he did not report

a thirty percent variation in primer residue data between shells because

he did not consider the variation significant. Id. at 114. Shaneyfelt

testified that he had not submitted a report on the four frames allegedly

spliced out of the Zapruder film of the assassination because the film print

from which he had worked was complete. Shaneyfelt Deposition, at 21.

NW 54999

DocId: 32989522

Page 269

---

## Page 270

What an examiner did with test results likewise varied. In many

instances, the examiner dictated a report on the tests conducted, either

for use on its own or for incorporation in a more comprehensive report

prepared by the examiner's superior. Frazier Deposition, at 11; Gallagher

Deposition, at 38. Gallagher, however, indicated. that he occasionally

submitted data directly to Special Agent Frazier who transmuted the figures

into prose. Gallagher Deposition, at 38. When the examiner himself pre-

pared the report, he did not always include in it all the results obtained,

as when the testing was done for "background purposes," Gallagher Deposi-

tion, at 57; when flaws in the testing itself cast the results in doubt,

see id. at fI, or when the results would simply not be of value, in the

examiner's judgment. Cunningham Deposition, at 47. In some instances,

the examiner's failure to make a report is unexplained.

See Cunningham

Deposition, at 33, 53; Gallagher Deposition, at 73-74.

After the report was prepared, one copy went into FBI files,

another went to the "original contributor" of the item of evidence on which

the report was based (generally the FBI's Dallas field office), and a third

went to the examiner or examiners responsible, for them to retain informally

with their notes

of the tests. Cunningham Deposition, at 11-12, 17;

Frazier Deposition, at 12, 15; Gallagher Deposition;,; at 86-87. Whether

the Warren Commission received the actual reports, and how the reports the

Commission received were transmitted, varied widely. Former Special Agent

Frazier recalled the "mechanics" of the process as being, first, that the

laboratory forwarded the report to the Dallas field office; next, that the

Dallas office incorporated the report into its report to the Commission,

and finally, that the latter report was transmitted to the Connission.

Frazier Deposition, at 19-20. In practice; however, there appears to have

been substantial, continuing and direct contact between laboratory personnel

and the Commission. Cunningham Deposition, at 49-50; Frazier Deposition,

at 20-21; Shaneyfelt Deposition, at 8. Frazier indicated that several

laboratory employees, whose identities he could not recall, served as

NW 54999

DocId: 32989522 Page 270

## Page 271

. -8-

liaison between the laboratory and the Commission.

Frazier Deposition, at

20. Cunningham stated

that he "generated some correspondence" with the

Commission every day during the laboratory's participation in the investi-

gation. Cunningham Deposition, at 51. Shaneyfelt indicated that his reports

went to the Connission via his section chief, and that he testified to the

Commission, either live or. by deposition, on all examinations he conducted.

Shaneyfelt Deposition,

•"In his affidavit of May 13, 1965, John Wi

Kilty, special agent assigned to the FBI laboratory in a supervisory capacity,

stated that plaintiff had been

told that all final FBI laboratory reports

in the pertinent categories of testing had been furnished to the Commission.

However, there apparently was io monitoring system known to deponents

to

10g

the transfer

final reports to the Commission, and

no custodian

within

the laboratory

to collect final laboratory reports.

Frazier Deposition,

at 68. It is clear, on the other hand, that not all examiners' observation

notes went to the Commission, the rule being that examiners retained

their

notes: except when the supervisor prepared a report directly from the notes.

Cunningham Deposition, at 47, 52-53; Frazier Deposition, at 15; see

Gallagher Deposition, at 73, 107. One instance of the latter occurred when

Frazier used Gallagher's worksheets to prepare a report on testing of a

bullet fragment; both the worksheets and the report went to the Commission,

though only Frazier appeared before the Commission. Frazier Deposition,

at 42-44; Gallagher Deposition, at 82, 84. Finally, neither observation

notes, worksheets, nor final reports were distributed among units within

the laboratory, absent a specific reason. Cunningham Deposition, at 12-13;

Frazier Deposition, at 15, 18. Forner Special Agent Gallagher testified

that even within the spectrographic unit one examiner's report on testing

would not necessarily, or even customarily, have been circulated among the

other examiners in the same unit. Gallagher Deposition, at 7-8. An

examiner who performed tests on a particular item of evidence thus might

be unaware whether other units within the laboratory had performed other

tests on the same item. E.g. Cunningham Deposition, at 22-23; Gallagher

Deposition, at 6-7, 26; Shaneyfelt Deposition, at 16.

Tests Performed on Assassination Evidence. The Court of Appeals

opinion remanding this case for further consideration and

testimony adverts

to five areas of continuing factual dispute 1177 U.S. App. D.C. at 163-64,.

543 F.2d

at 310-11]:

(1) Final reports of spectrographic analyses;=

(2) Reports on neutron activation analyses of bullet fragments;

(3) Raw data of spectrographic and neutron activation analysis

tests;

(4) Neutron activation analysis of clothing; and

3/

(5) Emissions spectroscopy data and reports.

Plaintiff's opposition to

the motion for sunmary judgment identi-

fies nine specific areas of

testing, encompassed

within the five areas

enumerated by the Court of Appeals, in which plaintiff asserts the evidence

shows tests should have been, or were, conducted, yet concerning which

plaintiff has received no materials. These areas

are:

(1) Neutron activation analysis of clothing, Opp., at 7-8;

(2) Neutron activation analysis of windshield scrapings, Opp.,

at 8-9;

(3) Neutron activation analysis of 03, a bullet fragment dis-

covered beside the right front seat of

the Presidential

limousine, Opp.,

at 9;

(4) Print-outs for neutron activation analysis of Q3 and

other

specimens, Opp., at 9;

(5) Testing of the live round found chambered in the

Mannlicher-Carcano rifle determined to have been the

murder weapon, and comparison of said live round with

shells found at the scene, Opp:, at 9-10;

3/

The distinction between spectroscopic analysis and

spectrography herein should be deemed to encompass

spectroscopy where appropriate.

NW 54999. DocId: DocId:32989522 Page 272

## Page 273

-10-

(6) Spectrographic testing of the curbstone supposed

to have

been struck by a bullet, a bullet fragment or fragments,

or other airborne debris during the moments of the

assassination, Oppo, at 10;

(7) Testing of the bullet holes below the collar button of

the shirt President Kennedy was wearing when he was

shot, Opp., at 10;

(8) A "formal report" prepared by Frazier on the basis of

Gallagher's comparison of windshield

scrapings with

other bullet matter, and alluded to in an exchange

between Commission counsel and Frazier during 'Frazier's

• testimony before the Commission, Opp:, at 10-11; and

4/

(9) Report

on neutron activation testing, Opp., at 1l.

As these differently organized catalogs of potential factual

issues indicate, there are numerous ways of approaching the factual aspects

of this case for

the purpose of determining whether they engender issues

of sufficient magnitude to defeat the motion for summary judgment.

What

follows is an

amalgam or

combination of the Court of Appeals' and plaintiff's

approaches, in that this discussion commences with general observations

on

firearms testing, spectrography, and

neutron activation analysis,

with

particular emphasis on each technique's capabilities and limitations, and

proceeds to consideration of testing on specific items of evidence.. It

should be stressed that the question throughout is not whether tests ought

to have been made, or even whether tests that actually were made should have

culminated in the preparation of reports, but simply whether there is any

genuine issue as to the existence of the reports and other materials

plaintiff Weisberg seeks.

Plaintiff does not indicate which item of evidence is

the subject of the allegedly extant report; the

reference will be construed hereafter as applying both

to the windshield residues discussed in the preceding

paragraph of the Opposition; and to the body of

assassination evidence as a whole.

Firearms Identification. Special Agent Cunningham's work with

the firearms and toolmarks unit of the laboratory's Scientific Analysis

Section has included the examination.of firearms and bullets to determine.

the source of particular bullets. Cunningham testified that the process

commences with the marking, weighing, and identification of the slug as

to type and characteristics. Cunningham Deposition, at 18-19. The bullet

is examined microscopically for rifling marks that might be useful for

purposes of identifying the source of the bullet. Id. at 19-20. If a

weapon believed to be the source of the bullet is on, hand, as was the

Mannlicher-Carcano rifle in the Presidential assassination, it, too, is

examined. Id. at 20-22. The examiner then fires

the weapon using ammunition

as similar as possible to the bullet under

analysis.

Id. at 25.

The

"evidence bullet"

and the test bullet then are viewed

simultaneously under

a comparison microscope. Id. Any of three

conclusions is possible:

identification, indicating that the bullet under study was fired from the

weapon in question, and no other; non-identification, indicating

that

the

general rifling characteristics of the two bullets vary to the degree suf-

ficient to exclude the weapon as the source of the bullet under

analysis;

and "no conclusion," indicating that the general characteristics are

similar, but that the individual markings are either different or lacking.

Id. at 26-27.

Spectrography.

Former Special Agent Gallagher was a specialist in

both spectrographic examination and neutron activation analysis. In

spectrographic analysis, samples are either sparked or burned; the results

show up on spectrographic plates from which the examiner derives composition

data. Gallagher Deposition, at 37-38.

Spectrographic examination will

elicit information on a range of elements, though specific readings in

multiple tests of the same item of evidence may vary as

a consequence of

the technique's relative insensitivity, inherent testing error, and

compositional differences between different portions

of

the object under

analysis. Id. at 41-42,

54, 58-60. Although

less sensitive than neutron

-12-

activation analysis, spectrographic testing appears to have been much more

abundantly used

in the examination of evidence, apparently because of

the

limitations inherent in neutron activation analysis.

Neutron Activation Analysis. In 1964, during the neutron acti-

vation analysis conducted

in connection with the investigation into the

assassination of President, Kennedy, neutron activation analysis was rela-

tively in an infant state, particularly so far as the equipment was con-

cerned: Id. at 115. Even so, it was a far more sensitive technique for

measuring the presence of certain elements in samples than spectrography:

it was about twice as sensitive with respect to antimony, barium and other

elements present in items of the assassination evidence, and up to a

thousand times as serisitive with respect to other elements.

Id. at 116.

Its limitations, however, precluded its use on many items of

assassination

evidence, and vitiated the

results of

some tests that were performed

on

items. Id. at 50-51, 92.

One such limitation was that only a handful of

elements were discernible through neutron activation analysis. Id. at 42.

Another was that certain elements, such as sodium and copper, showed up so

prominently in neutron activation analysis results as to obscure others.

Id. at 51, 74. Thus, items of evidence composed largely of copper, such

as copper bullet jackets,

were not subjected

to neutron activation analysis.

Id. at 74-75, 97, 98-99. By the same token,

however, lead does not show

up in neutron activation analysis. 'Id. at 109.

On behalf of the FBI laboratory, Gallagher conducted neutron

activation analysis on items of assassination evidence at the reactor at

Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.

Gallagher Deposition, at 64.

The paraffin lifts taken from Lee Harvey Oswald

were tested shortly after

the assassination, but other items were not tested

at Oak Ridge until

'May 1964. Id. at 63, 65. When plaintiff's counsel asked him to explain

the delay with respect to other items, Gallagher pointed out that the FBI's

access to the reactor was limited, and that the paraffin lifts were tested

WW 54999

## Page 276

early because they were tested

solely by neutron activitation analysis,

whereas bullet samples could be tested by spectrography as well.

Id. at

65.

Two additional observations on both spectrographic examination

and neutron activation analysis should be made in yesponse to points raised

in plaintiff Weisberg's affidavit. First, plaintiff asserts that none of

the reports he has been furnished alludes to microscopic examination,

which both Cunningham and Gallagher testified they frequently conducted.

Weisberg Affidavit, at 32; Cunningham Deposition, 18÷19; Gallagher Depo

sition, at 31. Gallagher's explanation was that microscopic examination,

at least within the FBI laboratory, is

so widely accepted as

preliminary

to spectrographic

and other

tests as not to be worth

noting

in a report.

Gallagher Deposition, at 107. That, in plaintiff's words, "there is not

a word in a single report" about microscopic examination is

entirely

consistent with Gallagher's statement that FBI laboratory practice was to

omit reference to microscopic examination. The second point raised by

plaintiff is that the FBI laboratory reports contain "no statement of

positive proof in the comparisons" of different items of evidence; "[there

is only the meaningless description of 'similar.'" Weisberg Affidavit,

at 8. Here,

too, the deposition testimony reveals the plaintiff to be

under a misapprehension, stemming from ignorance not of FBI laboratory

practice in

this instance,

but of the inherent limitations of

FBI examina-

tion techniques.

Even neutron activation analysis, a much more sophisticated

technique than spectrography, frequently will not enable bullet fragments,

for example, to be positively identified as having come from a particular

bullet. Cunningham Deposition, at 45-48; Gallagher Deposition, at 97-98.

Neither will it be possible in many instances to exclude a fragment.as having

come from a given bullet, as when compositional variances are not suffi-

ciently great to indicate different sources rather than fluctuations in

composition within the bullet. Gallagher Deposition, at 102-05.

CE # 399:

The "Pristine Bullet."

The Warren Commission con-

cluded that Commission Exhibit 399, one of the bullets fired

at the

Presidential motorcade that day, had passed

through the President's neck,

and struck successively Governor Connally's chest, wrist, and thigh,

ending its journey without substantial visible damage to itself.

Plaintiff's counsel directed' numerous questions to both Cunningham and

Frazier on how the slug coula have inflicted so much damage without itself

sustaining damage. Cunningham Deposition, at 34-37; Frazier Deposition,

at 24-28; 31-33. Although plaintiff's line of questioning is, at best,

doubtfully relevant to the question whether plaintiff has received all

material on CE 399, plaintiff has devoted considerable discussion

to the

physical

state

of CE 399. Weisberg Affidavit, at 44-48.

Cunningham was

•asked whether he would expect a bullet alleged

to have inflicted

the damage

attributed

to CE 399 to

emerge as unscathed

as CE 399. Cunningham Deposi-

tion, at 35.

Cunningham pointed out

that a relatively heavy bullet with a

slow muzzle velocity normally is less likely to

fragment.upon impact than

lighter, faster slugs, and that the damage imputed to CE 399 and its out-

wardly pristine condition were not inconsistent. Id. at 36-37. Frazier,

who with Cunningham and one other had performed the ballistics tests on

assassination evidence, observed that CE 399 had flattened slightly during

its journey and might have extruded a significant amount of lead, in the

form of fragments, from its base. Frazier Deposition, at 26-27, 32, 38-39.

The remainder of plaintiff's assertions regarding CE 399 concern

tests he claims ought

to have been performed, such

as comparison

of CE 399

with core fragments. Weisberg Affidavit, at 15, 16. Gallagher indicated

that he indeed had made such comparisons, but that aside from the spectro-

graphic worksheets which formed the basis of Frazier's November 23, 1963

report, he prepared no reports on the comparison under spectrography or

neutron activation analysis. Gallagher Deposition, at 26, 73-74.

Gallagher indicated also that a directive to preserve CE 399 "for posterity"

precluded his testing different portions of

the bullet for composition,

54999

DocId: 32989522 Page 277

---

## Page 278

- 15-

id. at 57, though he ran multiple tests on the samples

he was permitted to

remove. Id. at 59-60. Apart from plaintiff's allegations, there is

nothing to suggest that any comparative

test reports, by

spectrographic

and neutron activation techniques, were prepared other than those furnished

to plaintiff. That such tests

should have been made is not relevant, even

if true.

The first report disseminated by the FBI laboratory took

the form

of a letter dated November 23, 1963, to Dallas Police Chief Jesse Curry.

Gallagher Exh. 5. Portions of this letter indicate that CE 399 [referred

to in the letter as Ql] was fired from the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, and

that the windshield scrapings as well as certain bullet fragments were

determined to be similar in composition to CE 399. Gallagher Exh. 5, at 2.

In the

course of his testimony before the Commission, Frazier was questioned

about a "comparison made of

the lead

residues on the inside

of the wird:-

shield

with

.. the bullet fragments. . ."

Frazier indicated he had

prepared "the formal report of the entire examination" based

on the report

Gallagher had

submitted. Plaintiff claims not to have received either

the

"formal report" or the "report" prepared by Gallagher. Opposition, at 11.

The confusion as to the latter appears to have stemmed from differences in

terminology: what Frazier called a report consisted of Gallagher's work-

sheets. Gallagher Deposition, at 84.

As to the "formal report," plaintiff

argues that the November 23 letter could not possibly cover

"the entire

examination" because much testing, particularly the neutron activation

analysis, did not transpire until months after the letter was written.

Opposition, at 11. Frazier and Gallagher, on the other hand, indicate

that the November 23 letter was

the "formal report" Frazier

alluded to in

his Commission testimony. Frazier Deposition,

at 41; Gallagher Deposition,

at 86. Here, too, the evidence is uniformly aganst plaintiff's assertion.

Frazier's reference to "the formal report of the entire examination" plainly

relates to the procedures about which he was just queried: the comparison

NW 54999

DocId: 32989522

Page 278

---

## Page 279

-16-

of the windshield residues with CE 399 and bullet fragments. Plaintiff's

assumption that the "formal report" covers the entire investigation rather.

than one of the numerous examinations which comprised the investigation is

wholly unwarranted. There is no evidence to controvert Frazier's and

Gallagher's statements that the November 23 letter was, in fact, the

"formal report" described by Frazier before the Commission.

Plaintiff also contends that neither CE 399 nor any bullet

fragment was tested

for human residue. Weisberg Affidavit, at 14.

Because

this allegation does not concern the existence of unfurnished reports but

rather the appropriateness of such tests, such

contention need not be con-

sidered except

to note that

the depositions yield

no indication that

such

testing

ever occurred. Cunningham Deposition, at 22-23;

Gallagher Depo-

sition, at 39, 48.

Plaintiff asserts he received no report on "the analysis of the

copper-jacket material." Weisberg Affidavit,

at 15. Gallagher indicated

that laboratory practice was not to test copper jackets spectrographically

unless such testing would

contribute to the investigation. Gallagher

Deposition, at 13. Copper's tendency to overshadow other

elements under

neutron activation analysis precluded testing of

that kind. Id. at 74-75.

Nothing in the record indicates reports or other materials in this area

have not been furnished.

Q8: The Live Round. Plaintiff claims repeatedly not to have

received reports on Q8, the live round discovered in the chamber of the

Mannlicher-Carcano rifle. Opposition, at 10; Weisberg Affidavit, at 16,

57. Gallagher was unaware whether the round had been tested, and indicated

that it probably should have been tested. Gallagher Deposition, at 43-46.

Defendant Department of Justice has indicated that Q8 was subjected to

"Firearms Identification" testing only. Defendant United States Department

of Justice's Answers to Plaintiff's First Set of Interrogatories, at 4.

Inexplicably, however, plaintiff directed questions about Q8 only to

NW 54999

DocId: 32989522 Page 279

---

## Page 280

-17-

Gallagher, who was unfamiliar with testing in the firearms identification

category, and

not to Frazier or Cunningham, both of whom conducted

firearms

identification tests. Though what either of the latter might have said

about Q8 is open to speculation, the November 23, 1963 report

to Chief

Curry describes Q8 only, as being of

the same manufacture as certain

cartridges found on the scene in the school book depository building. The

inference

to be drawn, uncontroverted by any other evidence, is that Q8 was

subjected to visual scrutiny only by one of the ballistics examiners, and

thus that no reports of other material on Q& remain to be furnished.: It

is worth noting parenthetically that the plaintiff does not indicate, and

the Court does not discern, what purpose additional testing of 08 woula

have served. In that respect, Gallagher's supposition--that no further

testing of Q8 was necessary because it was sufficient that the live round

was of the same manufacture as

the cartridges--seems eminently reasonable.

Gallagher Deposition, at 46-47, 68-69. There is no

evidence to

suggest

that reports or other materials on Q8 have not been supplied.

Testing of Clothing. Taken together, the Weisberg

affidavit

and plaintiff's Opposition to

the motion for

summary judgment reveal only

one point of dispute: whether a report exists comparing the two anterior

holes in CE 394, the shirt worn by President Kennedy on November 22, 1963.

Opposition, at 10; Weisberg Affidavit, at 24-25. As to the remaining

tests

performed on items of clothing (the President's, Governor Connally's, and

Oswald's), the record indicates that spectrographic testing only was per-

formed on these items, and that

neutron activation analysis was not performed

because

laboratory personnel did not deem it

an appropriate technique

for

those items.

Letter from J. Edgar Hoover to J. Lee Rankin (March 23, 1964); Memorandum

from R. H. Jevons to Mr. Conrad (April 15, 1964).

The sole basis for plaintiff's assertion that an extant report on

the comparison of CE 394 holes remains to be furnished is that former

Special Agent Frazier testified in the course of his deposition that he

had asked another examinerto determine, by buttoning the shirt, whether

the two anterior holes overlap: Frazier Deposition, at 60-62. Initially,

Frazier could

not recall whether he himself had

conducted

that aspect of the

examination of the shirt, id. at 61, and he subsequently indicated that

another examiner, whom he thought was Paul M.

Stombaugh, had made the

examination, and prepared a report on his conclusions.

Id. at 62. Frazier

assumed that the Commission had obtained a copy of the report in the

course

of taking Stombaugh's testimony. Id. There is no indication outside

Frazier's deposition testimony that Stombaugh, or any examiner other than

Frazier, prepared such a report. CE 394 was

discussed only twice in the

course of

the Commission hearings, by Cndr. James J. Humes, a pathologist

at the Naval Medical Center who testified on

the autopsy

conducted on the

body of the President,

and by Frazier himself.

Frazier

stated first that

he himself had conducted the examination of the President's

V Hearings Before the President's Comm'n on

the Assassination of President

Kennedy 60 (1964). He stated that "on the front of the shirt, I found what

amounts to one hole. Actually, it is a hole through both the button line

of the shirt and the buttonhole line which overlap down the front of the

shirt when it is buttoned." Id. Frazier's testimony before the Conmission

compels the conclusion that he was mistaken in attributing responsibility

for the examination of the two anterior holes to another examiner.

One

5/

Commander Humes indicated that "with the shirt buttoned, the

fly front of the shirt causes two layers of cloth to be

present in this location, and that [sic] there is a defect

in the inner layer of cloth and a corresponding defect in

the outer layer of the cloth." II Hearings Before the

President's Comm'n on the Assassination of President

Kennedy 365 (1964).

He said also that "the defects in 393

[the President's suitcoat] and 394 [the shirt] coincide

virtually exactly with one another." Id. at 366.

explanation for his error, aside from the lapse of more than thirteen

years

since

the examination in question, is that Special Agent Stombaugh

indeed

examined

the fibers of a shirt linked with the assassination, and

testified before the Commission on

the results of his examination; the

shirt in question, however, was CE 150, that worn by lee Harvey Oswald at

the point he was captured py police. IV Hearings, supra, at 74-75.

There being no genuine question as to the existence of the report alluded

to by Frazier in his deposition, this point, too, must be resolved against

the plaintiff.

Neutron Activation Testing of Fragments and Residue. Plaintiff

claims not to have

received extant reports on the neutron activation

analysis of Q3, a fragment recovered

from beside the right front seat of

the Presidential limousine, and Q15, residues

obtained by

scraping the

inside of

the limousine's windshield. Opposition, at 8-9; Weisberg

Affidavit, at 13. The Department of Justice answers

to

plaintiff's inter-

rogatories indicated that neither Q3 nor Q15 was subjected

to neutron

activation analysis. Defendant United States Department of Justice's

Answers to Plaintiff's First Set of Interrogatories, at 12, 13. When

former Special Agent Gallagher was queried

about Q3, he initially could not

recall testing it, but later, on his own initiative, he remembered sub-

jecting the item to neutron activation analysis and emerging with no

significant result. Gallagher Deposition, at 74-75, 90-92. The lack of

results for Q3, a fragment consisting chiefly of copper jacket, is con-

sistent with Gallagher's previous statement that copper is normally not

susceptible to neutron activation analysis.

Id. at 74. As to Q15, the

windshield scraping, Gallagher stated, after initial inability to recall,

that neutron activation analysis had, just as with Q3, not resulted in any

significant finding, chiefly because the Q15 sample was inadequate. Id.

at 71. In each case, Gallagher had left his worksheets virtually blank,

accounting for the Department's assumption in its answers to plaintiff's

interrogatories that no neutron activation analysis on these items had been

NW 54999

DocId: 32989522 Page 282

## Page 283

-20-

conducted. The record indicates conclusively that, despite its denial

that such testing had occurred, the Government has unwittingly supplied

the plaintiff with the very worksheets to indicate that such testing did

occur, albeit unsuccessfully. As to the printouts from the testing,

Gallagher indicated that the data on the printouts was duplicative of that

on the worksheets, and hence that. the printouts themselves might not have

been kept. Gallagher Deposition, at 92, 117. The deposition testimony

on the neutron activation analysis conducted on fragments does not indi-

cate

that tests were conducted for which materials have not been furnished.

Dealey Plaza Curbstone. Plaintiff claims that he was not supplied

with materials relating

to testing

performed

on a curbstone removed in 1964

from near the site of the assassination. Opposition, at 10; Weisberg

6/

Affidavit, at 10, 36-42.

According to bystanders

at the assassination,

there were indications that a bullet or bullet fragment had

struck the

curbstone during the moments of firing at the Presidential Limousine. On

July 7, 1964, the Warren Commission requested an examination of the curb-

stone, and early in August Special Agent Lyndal Shaneyfelt was dispatched

to Dallas to retrieve it. The result of his analysis of the "smear" he

discovered on the curbstone was that the foreign substances

thereon "could

be bullet metal." Shaneyfelt Exh. 2. The tests conducted on the curbstone

were microscopic and spectrographic only; no neutron

activation

analysis

was conducted. Gallagher Deposition, at 69-70. The decision not to subject

It might be noted that plaintiff's allegations regarding

the curbstone extend far beyond testing materials

supposedly not furnished pursuant to his FOIA requests.

His submissions include the affidavit of James T. Tague,

a witness to the assassination apparently struck by un-

identified debris associated, Tague contends, with the

mark on the curbstone.

Tague Affidavit, at 7. Much of

the affidavits of both plaintiff Weisberg and Mr. Tague

are directed toward establishing that the mark on the

curbstone underwent drastic alteration,

1963 to a smear in mid-1964, when the FBI recovered the

It is not clear from plaintiff's affidavit

whether he is asserting that the FBI removed the wrong

curbstone, or that the curbstone is the same, with only

different.

Compare Weisberg Affidavit I 185

with id. " 194.

In any case, none of the allegations on

these points needs be considered in the context of

plaintiff's FOIA requests, and the extent of Government

compliance therewith.

the mark to neutron activation analysis explains the disparity

between the

two elements isolated in the "smear" and the nine isolated from bullet core

fragments, and accounts also for the laboratory's reluctance to

attribute

the mark to a bullet. See Weisberg Affidavit, $ 33, at 10; Frazier Deposi-

tion, at 48; Shaneyfelt Exh. 2.

As to microscopic-examination, Frazier

testified

on deposition that he had

scrutinized

the curbstone mark under

a microscope, and Shaneyfelt indicated that he misht have done so

in the

course of conducting other tests on the mark.

Frazier Deposition, at 51;

Shaneyfelt Deposition, at 14. Frazier incorporated

,the results of his

microscopic examination of the curbstone into a draft of a letter eventually

sent August 12, 1964, by J. Edgai Hoover to Commission counsel Rankin. The

spectrographic examination of the curbstone was conducted by Special Agent

William R. Heilman, now retired. Memorandum from M. J. Stack, Jr. to Mr.

Cochran (June 20, 1975).

The spectrographic plate which reflects the

single run to which Heilman subjected

the curbstone has not been furnished

to the plaintiff; Heilman believes it was discarded

in the course of one

of the laboratory's periodic housecleanings. Id. Shaneyfelt

testified

to not having seen any

other reports on the curbstone besides

those shown

to him in the course of

his deposition. Shaneyfelt

Deposition, at 15.

Taken together, these

aspects of the record indicate uniformly that all

available material on testing of the curbstone has been furnished to

plaintiff.

CONCLUSION

The foregoing analysis of the record has disposed of every con-

tention and claim the Court has been able to elicit from plaintiff's various

submissions. In many instances, there is direct testimony that a particular

test was not performed; in others, testimony as to particular laboratory

practices compels the

conclusion that the test was not

performed.

For all

its detail, the preceding

analysis does not

pretend

to

treat

such

aspects of

plaintiff's argument as the alleged

destruction of assassination evidence

and falsification of test results.

Neither topic is pertinent. The

analysis likewise has not dealt extensively with plaintiff's allegations

-22-

and suggestions, sounding of conspiracy, that reports and materials have been

stolen or deliberately mislaid,

and that Government witnesses have lied under

oath; apart from these allegations, there is not an iota of evidence to

support either assertion.

A FOIA action demonstrably lacking in genuine issues of naterial

fact is appropriately zesplyed by summary judgment. See Nolen v. Rumsfeld,

535 F.2d 890, 891 (5th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1104 (1977). This

action lacks such issues. Although plaintiff has impugned defendants'

affidavits on the ground 'that they do not specify the files searched in

compliance with plaintiff's request, Opposition, at 12, the Government's

response to a FOIA request need not be as specific as plaintiff would require,

it being sufficient that the affiant has personal knowledge that all files

which might contain requested material have been searched. Exxon Corp. v.

FIC, 384 F. Supp. 755, 759-61 (D.D.C. 1974), remanded without opinion, 527

F.2d 1386 (D.C. Cir. 1976).

As in Nolen, supra, "[t)he Government has, in candor and

good faith

before this Court, stated that all the records available have been made

available to the plaintiff." 535 F.2d at 891. If plaintiff has any further

recourse, it is not under FOIA. See id. Accordingly, defendants' motion

for summary judgment must be granted.

An Order consistent with the foregoing has been entered

Plaintift's attorney was advised by correspondence prior

to filing of this action that the Atomie Energy Commission (now

Energy Research and Development Adninistration) provided cechnical

assistance to the F.B.I. at ABC's Oal: Ridge National laboratory

(now Holifield Mational Laboratory) In perforing paraffin casts

taken from Lee Harvey Ostald and neutron activation analyses of

bullet fragmento. Plaintiff's attorney was further advised that

neither AlC nor its laboratory at Oak Ridge prepared any report on

the results of these analyses, and was referred to che F.B.I. for

any further inforation. (plaintift's Exhibit E to the complaint;

attaciment to plaintift interrogatories to EruA). .

responsive to plaintift's request.

Defendants also attach hereto the affidavit of Bertram Hi.

contested the fact that all inforuation had been provided, The

Court also suggested that a reasonable way to proceed would be

for plaintife to specily what documents he contended had not

subsequent to the caleridar call, counsel for defendants

served with plaintift's motion to strike the kilty affidavit

motions calculated to probe behind defendants' assertione of

good faith compliance with plaintife's freedon of Infornation Act

Further search is being nade by the F.B.I. 's FOIN Unit and Laboratory

as a result of plaintiff's latest claius to determine whether any

such items exist, and to provide then or indicate their whereabouts.

Accordingly, defendants have delayed filing their notion to dismiss

grounds of nootness until an official response can be made to

plaintiff's latest clains of non-compliance. Defendants are

endeavoring to complete this additional search and provide an

official response by way of supplemental affidavit within a matter

of a few days of the filing of this opposition, and expect to

In view of the foregoing, defendants respectfully request

the Court to deny plaintiff's lotions to strike the affidavit of John

documents.

AFFIDAVIT

I, John W. Kilty being duly sworn, depose

as follows:

1o I am a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation (FBI) assigned to the Laboratory Division of the

FBI, Washington, D. Ce, in a supervisory capacity.

2. I have personal knowledge that Harold Weisberg

directed a Freedom of Information Act request to the FBI for

documents relating to spectrographic and neutron activation

analysis examinations conducted in the John F. Kennedy

assassination case.

3. On March I4, 1975, I was present at a meeting

with Mi. Weisberg, his attorney, Mi. James H. Lesar, and

two

other representatives of the FBI, SAs Robert A. Frazier and

•Thomas H. Bresson. The purpose of this meeting was to identify

specifically the scope of Mr. Weisberg's request since he had

been advised that all final reports with regard to the requested

data had been furnished to the Warren Commission and are available

to the public.

4. At this meeting Mr. Weisberg requested the

following:

Specific spectrographic and neutron activation

matérial which consists of tabies and pages with results of

readings, representing examinations of metal fragments from the

bodies of President Kennedy and Governor Connally.

D.

Spectrographic analysis from the areas on

the clothing of President Kennedy and Governor Connally where.

the bullets may have passed.

examination data which may be

available regarding testing done on a curbstone near the

crime scene.

5o All available data relating to the above consists

of 22 pages also furnished to Mr. Lesar by SA Bresson on

March 31, 1975.

6. I have personal knowledge that Mr. Lesar thereafter

advised the FBI's Freedom of Information Unit that Mr. Weisberg

- had intended his request as defined

at the meeting of March 14,

1975, to include certain data which was shown to him at the close

of that meeting This material, consisting of 54 pages of data

and results of neutron activation examinations conducted on

certain metal fragments from the body of President Kennedy, the

stretcher, and the President's automobile, is referred to in &

létter from Director Clarence M. Kelley to Mr. Lesar dated

April 10, 1975, and attached hereto. All this material was

furnished to Mr. Weisberg by letter from Director kelley to

Mío Lesar dated April 15, 1975, a copy of which is also attached.

7. With regard to the interrogatories submitted by

Mr. Weisberg, the affiant states that the FBI Laboratory emplored

methods of elemental analysis, namely neutron activation analysis

and emission spectroscopy. Neutron activation analysis and

emission spectroscopy were used to determine the elemental compo-

sition of the borders and edges of holes in clothing and metallic

smears present on a windshield and a curbstone.

8. I have conducted a review of FBI files which woula

contain information that Mr. Weisberg has requested under the

Freedom of Information Act. I have had compiled the materials

v.

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT

OF JUSTICE, et al.,

Plaintiff,

Defendants.

Civil Action No. 75-0226

AFFIDAVIT

BERTRAM H. SCHUR, being first duly sworn, hereby deposes and says:

1. I am Associate General Counsel of the United States Energy

Research

and Development Administration (ERDA), which on January 19, 1975,

pursuant to the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-438) and

Executive Order 11834 (January 15, 1975), assumed the functions of the

Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) other than licensing and related regulatory

functions. Prior to January 19, 1975, and since June 27, 1962, I had

been Associate General Counsel

of the AEC.

2. I am familiar with Plaintiff's request to the AEC for copies

of reports on the results of tests performed by or for the AEC on behalf

of the Warren Commission.

3. I have caused to-be made searches of the ERDA (AEC) files and

• inquiries of ERDA (AEC) personnel and ERDA (AEC) contractor personnel

who should have been knowledgeable regarding the subject matter of Plaintiff's

request.

4. The results of these searches and inquiries were reported to

me as follows:

.a. The AEC's Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL; now known

as the Holifield National Laboratory) did provide technical

support to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in

the performance of neutron activation analyses on the paraffin

casts from the right hand, the left hand, and the right

cheek of Lee Harvey Oswald and on bullet fragments;

'"!"

-2-

b. neither AEC nor ORNL prepared any report on the results

of these analyses; and

c. no other tests were performed by or for the AEC on behalf

of the Warren Commission.

5. ORNL did retain copies of some photographs of the paraffin

casts and Xerox copies of some of the raw data obtained by the FBI

in the course of the neutron

activation analyses, and these are being

made available to Plaintiff although they were not understood to be

covered by his request.

6. • Some analytical work on simulated evidence was done by General

Atomic at the John Jay Hopkins Laboratory for Pure and Applied Science

in San Diego, California, using a 6.5 mm. Mannlicher-Carcano rifle of

exactly the same type as the one involved in the assassination of

President Kennedy. This work was funded under an AEC contract, and was

done in furtherance of a continuing, independent research program that

began in 1962. The work involved no evidence samples from the assassination

and was not done on behalf of the Warren Commission.

This work was

reported in the following two publications:

a.

"Use of Neutron Activation Analysis in Scientific Crime

Detection" (GA-6152, February 15, 1965).

b. "Applications of Neutron Activation Analysis in Scientific

Crime Investigátion" (GA-9807, June 30, 1970).

These reports are not

understood to be covered by Plaintiff's

request.

Copies may be purchased from the National Technical Information

Service, U. S. Department of Commerce, Springfield, Virginia 22151.

7.. I am not aware of any other information that would be responsive

to Plaintiff's First Set of Interrogatories to Defendant U. S. Energy

Research•and Development Administration.

ATTORNEY AT LAW

1231 FOURTH STREET, S. W.

WASHINGTON, D. C. 20024

TELEPHONE: (202) 484-6023

January 15, 1975

The Honorable Laurence Silberman

Acting Attorney General

U. S. Department of Justice

Washington, D. C.

20530

Dear Mr. Silberman:

I

am writing on behalf of a client, Mr. Harold Weisberg, of

Frederick, Maryland.

For nine years Mr. Weisberg has been trying to obtain the re-

sults of certain spectrographic analyses which were made for the

Warren Commission as part of the investigation into the assassina-

tion of President John F. Kennedy. Mr. Weisberg's original efforts

to force the disclosure of these spectrographic analyses culminated

in a suit brought under the

Freedom of Information Act. Ultimately,

after a special en banc hearing at which the United States Court of

Appeals for the District of Columbia reversed the decision of the

Court of Appeals panel, Mr. Weisberg lost the suit.

[See Weisberg

V. U.S. Department of Justice,. 489 F. 2d 1195 (1973) 1

As you know, Congress has since amended the Freedom of Infor-

mation Act. During the floor debate on May 30, 1974, Senator Philip

Hart proposed an amendment to the

"investigatory files" exemption

which the Department of Justice had invoked to thwart Mr. Weisberg's

access to the spectrographic analyses.

An exchange between Senator

Hart

and Senator Edward Kennedy made it clear that this amendment

was intended to override the decision of the Court of Appeals in

the ot an

Thus, the enactment of the recently amended Freedom of

Information Act constitutes a congressional mandate for the disclo-

sure of the records Mr. Weisberg seeks.

On December 6, 1974, Ms. Weisberg wrote a letter to the Deputy

Attorney General requesting the disclosure of certain spectrographic

and neution activation and other tests

performed in connection with

the Warren Commission's investigation.

The Deputy Attorney Genecal

referred this letter to Mr. Clarence Kelley, the Director of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation. I am enclosing a copy of Mr.

Kelley's December 19, 1974

I call. your atten-

tion to its concluding sentence, which states:

"In the meantime, we

are attempting to identify and locate the documents in which you have

expressed an interest, and will communicate with you concerning this

in the near future."

In response to this, I wish to point out that an FBI Agent has

stated under oath that he "examined"

the spectrographic records. In

NW 54999 DooId: 32909522 Page 310

## Page 311

view of this, it is evident that there is no problem at all in

either identifying or locating these records, and any alleged

proolem Is obviously only a pretext for evading and stalling legal

This conclusion is further supported by

the fact that there. has been no further communication from Mr.

Kelley, despite his assurances that there would be.

Under these circumstances, I have advised Mr. Weisberg that

he has no alternative but to treat Mr. Kelley's letter 'as a denial

of his request for these records. In turn, Mr. Weisberg has aske

me to appeal that denial for him.

This letter constitutes Mr.

Weisberg's appeal from Mr. Kelley's denial of his request for

dis-

closure of the records specified in his December 6, 1974 letter. to

the Deputy Attorney General.

I believe that you should be aware that Mr. Weisberg has made

very serious charges about the reason why the Department of Justice

has gone to extraordinary lengths to keep these records from being

made public. In connection with his previous suit, Mr. Weisberg

executed an affidavit stating:

From evidence in my possession I believe that

the release of the results of the spectrographic

analyses would reveal that the FBI deceived the

Warren Commission members as to what these analyses

do in fact show.

Contrary to the assertions con-

tained in the Williams affidavit, I believe the

real reason the Department of Justice continues to

withhold these analyses is that they would prove

that the fBI engaged in deception of warren Com-

mission members anâ the American public.

Congress has now mandated the discloure of these records. If,

after that mandate, the Department of Justice still continues to

suppress them, then there is no alternative to the conclusions stated

by Mr. Weisberg in his affidavit.

In light of this, I would hope

that the Department will make these documents promptly available,

without puting Mr. Weisberg to the expense of yet another lawsuit.

Finally, I wish to remind you that Mr. Weisberg has also re-

quested the disclosure of of two itens of court evidence

in the

¡Watergate case. Mr. Weisberg appealed the Special Prosecutor's

denial of these requests more than a year ago. To date he has re-

FOLD WRICBERG: REQUESTS FOR

INFONHATION UNDER FREDDOM OE

INFORMATION ACT

Reference is made to your memorandum daled June 22, I70,

forwarding a letter from Mr. Weisberg for comment.

The following comments are in the order of the subject matter

set forth in Mr. Weisberg's letter:

(L) Exhibit 60 (Pictures of President Kennedy's Clothing):

Weisberg requested a photographic print of a composite

picture showing President Kennedy's clothing.

There is no single negativa of this composite picture;

however, there are attached printa made from the

photographic negatives from which the composite

picture of Exhibit 0t was prepared.

Mr. Weisberg refers to an identification symbol

"CD 107" in referring to FBI Exhibit 60. CD 10%

is the designation for the Warren Commission Documert

number 107. This document is a supplemental report

furnished the Warren Commission which contains

Ezhibit 60.

Mr. Weisberg's letter is being returned herewith

The Deputy Attorney General

(2) Spectrographic Analyses: In referring to the

testimony regarding the spectrographic analyses

of certain bullet evidence involved in the

assassination, Weisberg advises that the testimony

was simply that all specimens were of lead, no more.

This statement is not true since the testimony as

set out in Volume 5, Page 74, Line 1 of the Warren

Commission Report states specifically that the

various items "were found to be similar in metallic

composition." This statement encompasses trace

amounts of other metals besides lead which are

invariably present in bullet lead.

(3) Documentation Relating to David William Ferrie:

Mr. Weisberg in his letter of June 19, 1970, argues

in the last paragraph on Page one and the first

two paragraphs on Page two with the reply you furnished

him on June 12, 1970, dealing with his request for the

Ferrie material.

Our observations and comments previously furnished

to you regarding the Ferrie material remain unchanged;

that is, the final decision as to the public disclosure

of the material concerning Ferrie rests with the

Department of Justice, but this Bureau has no

objection to public disclosure of this material.

Mr. Weisberg argues that "all the records of the

Warren Commission are not in the National Archives."

This Bureau has no information that any of the Ferrie

material which we furnished to the Warren Commission

was not turned over by that Commission to the National

Archives. It is noted that the last sentence of the

Forward to the published Report of the Commission

reads: "The Commission is committing all of its

A sW 54999

reports and working papers to the National Archives,

where they can be permanently preserved under the

rules and regulations of the National Archives and

applicable Federal law." So far as is known by this

Bureau, this was done by the Commission before it

went out of existence.

Mr. Weisberg's argument in the second full paragraph

of his letter draws a distinction between "documents"

and "information." He does not describe what he

means by "information" and the distinction he draws

does not appear to make sense. Mr. Weisberg's

reference to Carlos Marcello is also not clear,

although the New Orleans attorney for Marcello,

Mr. G. Wray Gill, advised this Bureau on November 27,

1963, that Ferrie had done some investigative work

in the Marcello case. This was reported in Dallas

report of Special Agent Warren C. De Brueys dated

December 2, 1963, which was furnished to the Warren

Commission.

(4) Concerning Receipt of Material Obtained at the Autopsy:

Weisberg comments concerning Exhibit 843 containing

two objects and possibly a third. He also makes

wo pets stains ee you that miss weisberg

Exhibit 843 consists of two lead fragments removed

from President Kennedy's head at the time of the autopsy.

These are the only fragments removed from President

Kennedy's body and turned over to the FBI. They were

described as a "missile" in the receipt furnished Navy

authorities by Special Agents Francis X. O'Neill and

James W. Sibert.

(5) Autopsy Photographs: Weisberg was previously

advised by you that the FBI has never had possession

or custody of the autopsy photographs. It is difficult

to determine from Mir. Weisberg's letter whai he

bad in mind regarding this matter. However, this

Bureau has never had in ita possession any negatives,

prints, or copies of photographs taken at the time

of the autopsy.

The letter of Mr. Weisberg forwarded with your memorandum

is being returned herewith.

Enclosures (3)

NOTE:

We have had previous correspondence with the Department

regarding Mr. Weisberg and his requests for information under the

Freedom of Information Act. Weisberg is a prolific and notorious

critic of the Warren Commission, the FBI, et cetera. His criticisms

have included slanting of the truth and outright lies.

Relative to the autopsy photographs mentioned in Item 5,

the Laboratory has never had in its possession or custody any of

these photographs or any prints, negatives or other such material

relating to the autopsy. The Domestic Intelligence and the General

Investigative Divisions also advise that they have never had custody

of such material.

The material set out above concerning Ferrie was compiled

by the Domestic Intelligence Division.

SUBJECT:

HAROLD WEISBERG: REQUESTS FOR

INFORMATION UNDER FREEDOM OF

INFORMATION ACT

Im. Gallagher

7717

DATE: May 28; 1970

Reference is made to your memorandum dated May 19, 1970,

regarding Mr. Weisberg's request for certain information relating

to the assassination of former President Kennedy.

Your attention is directed to my letter to the Attorney General

dated November 20, 1967, entitled "Assassination of President JOhn Fitzgerald

Kennedy, November 22, 1963, Dallas, Texas," which set out information

concerning Harold Weisberg from the files of this Bureau. This

included the fact that Weisberg was one of ten employees fired summarily

by the State Department in 1947 because of suspicion of being a communist

or having communist sympathies. Later Weisberg was allowed to resign

without prejudice.

Weisberg has written several books concerning the assassination

of President Kennedy which attack the Warren Commission Report. His

book 'Whitewash-The Report of the Warren Report"' is a vitriolic and

diabolical criticism of the Warren Commission, the FBI, the Secret

Service, several other U. S. Government agencies, and the Dallas, Texas,

Police Department. It contains inaccuracies, falsehoods, and deliberate.

slanting of facts to fit Weisberg's purpose.

The following comments are in the order they were requested in

Mr. Weisberg's letters, copies of which were forwarded with your

memorandum:

(1)

Spectrographic Analyses: Weisberg has requested

details of the spectrographic analyses conducted on

certain bullet evidence involved in the assassination.

Reference is made to the matter entitled "John Nichols

Versus United States of America, et al., U.S. D.C.

D. Kan., Civil No. T-4536' and to my memorandum

to Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus dated February 17, 1959.

This material related to the release of spectrographic

data concerning certain bullet evidence involved in the

assassination of former President Kennedy. It is

understood that litigation is still pending as to whether

or not information regarding spectrographic analyses

will be released.

As mentioned in my memorandum of February 17, 1969,

spectrographic tests are adequately shown in the report

of the Warren Commissial where (Volume 5, Pages 6%,

69, 73 and 74) it is specifically set forth that the metal

fragments were analyzed spectrographically and were

found to be similar in composition. The work notes and

raw analytical data on which such results are based

are not normally made public particularly since they

can only be interpreted properly by scientifically trained

personnel.

The work notes and raw analytical data are part of the

investigative files of this Bureau and rightfully fall

within exemption number 7 of subsection (b) of 5 U.S. C.

552 which specifically exempts investigatory files compiled

for law enforcement purposes.

Release to any and all who request them of the raw

analytical data in the thousands of spectrographic tests

conducted in the numerous cases received by this Bureau

would pläce an unnecessary and heavy burden on this

Bureau and thus greatly hamper its efficient operstion;

and compliance with the current request would set a

potentially highly undesirable precedent in this regard.

The Deputy Attorney General

Based on these observations, it is our firm opinion

that the provisions of 5 U.S. C. 552, subsection (b),

exemption Y should be invoked and the request

of Mr. Weisberg for the spectrographic analyses

be denied.

(2)

Documentation Relating to David William Ferrie:

Mr. Weisberg described the records he requests

as documents relating tethe late David William

Ferrie of New Orleans:

(a) withheld from the Warren Commission and/or

Comment: No documents relating to David

William Ferrie were withheld by the FBI

from the Warren Commission.

(b) withheld from the National Archives

Comment: So far as is known, all records of

the Warren Commission pertaining to

David William Ferrie were turned over to the

National Archives by the Warren Commission,

together with all other records of the Warren

Commission.

(c)

withheld by the National Archives by order of the

Department of Justice

Comment: Your attention is directed to my letter

to the Attorney General dated May 15, 1968,

entitled "Assassination of President John Fitzgeralo

Kennedy, November 22, 1963, Dallas, Texas, " and

to my letter to the Acting Attorney General dated

February 24,

1967, entitled "Public Disclosure of

3

## Page 328

The Deputy Attorney General

Warren Commissio] Records. " Both of these

letters concerned 55 pages of Warren Commission

Document No. 15 which cea with allegations aid

• investigation regarding Ferrie. Copies of the 55

pages in question were enclosed with the letter of

February 24, 1937. These are pages 22-201,

225-228, 231-304, 307-311, 313-316, 510-2309

and 341-54s, all inclusive. In the letter Cosed

May 15, 1968, I stated thai the final decision as

to the public disclosure of the material concerning

Ferrie rests with the Department of Justice.

also advised that this Bureau has no objection to

public disclosure of the data concerning Ferrie.

These pages were originally excluded from public

disclosure under guidelines approved by Mir. McGeorge

Bundy, Special Assistant to the Presideri. The

specific guideline zoplicable is identified as s(C),

which provided that public disclosure shout ba made

unless disclosure "would be a source of embarrassment

to innocent persons, who are the subject, source,

or apparent source of the material in question,

because it contains gossip and rumor or desoils of

a personal nature having no significani connection

with the assassination of the President. " Our

position as to this information concerning Ferrie

has not changed since the May 15, 1968, letter.

(3) Exhibit 30 (Pictures of President Kennedy's Shiri and

Tie): Weisberg requested a photographic copy i - portion

Of Exhibit 30 showing the tabs of the President's shirt.

Apparently Archives has furnished a copy of is Exhibit,

NW 54999

Docid: 32989522 Page 328

---

## Page 329

The Deputy Attorney General

however, he has advised the quality of this copy is

not satisfactory for his purpose and has requested a

print from the original negative which is a part of

this Bureau's files.

Compliance with the request would set an undesirable

precedent and could lead to numerous such requests

for copies of photographic matter furnished the

Commission.

The Bureau can ill afford to divert away

from our important investigative responsibilities the

time needed to search our voluminous files and prépare

such material. However,

since the photograph referred

to as Exhibit 60 is available to the public through Archives

it is felt the matter of furnishing additional copies is for

the Department to decide and an additional photographic

print of the portion showing the "shirt tabs" is attached

in the event the Department wishes to set this precedent.

(4) - Concerning Receipt of Material Obtained at Autopsy:

Weisberg requested a photographand all records relating

to the material removed by Commander James Humes, M. C.,

U.S. No, at the time of the autopsy and receipted for by

Special

Agents Francis X. O'Neill and James W. Sibert:

November 22, 1963. This request appears to be based on

his inability to specifically identify the Exhibit in the

Commission report.

The material referred to in the receipt is identified as

Commission Exhibit 843. A photograph of this Exhibit was

furnished the Commission and was published in "Hearings

Before the President's Commission on the Assassination

of President Kennedy, " Volume 17, Page 841. Other

information regarding this Exhibit apperce elsewzore

in the Commission's Hearings.

(5)

Autopsy Photograghs: The fBI has never had posseasion

or, custody of the autopsy photographs requested by

Mr. Weisberg

Enclosure

NOTE:

A's is stated in the letter to the Deputy Attorney General and

as we have pointed out

in previous communications to officials of the

Department of Justice, Weisberg is a prolific and notorious critic of the

Warren Commission, the FBI, etc. His criticisms have included slanting

of the truth and outright lies.

So far as the Ferrie material is concerned, Ferrie died in

February, 1967. The 55 pages of information about him which were

withheld from public disclosure contained allegations, hearsay, and

rumor indicating he may have been a homosexual. This information was

withheld in 1965, two years before Ferrie's death. The previous

communications to Department officials which were written following

Ferrie's death took the position thailife had no objection to the release

of this information to the public; however, the final decision in this

regard was a decision to be made by the Department of Justice.

Regarding the photograph mentioned in Item 3 above informal

discussions with Mr. Carl Eardley, Deputy Assistant Attorney General,

show the Department feels that it would be difficult, if not impossible,

to sustain in cout a refusal to furnish copies of material the subject

matter of which is already available to the public.

NW 54999 DooId: 32989522 Page 330

---

## Page 331

The Deputy Attorney General

The receipt referred to in Item 4 above was made out for

a missile. The "missile" consisted of two small fragments of lead

recovered from the head of President Kennedy.

Relative to the autopsy photographs mentioned in Item 5,

the Laboratory has never had in its possession or custody any of

these photographs. This material has also been co-ordinated with

the Domestic Intelligence and General Investigative Divisions:

Both Divisions advise that they have never had custody of the autopsy

photographs.

Material set out above concerning Ferrie and background on

Weisberg compiled and furnished by Domestic Intelligence Division.

Code 301/473-8186

November 27: 1974

The Deputy Attorney General

The Department of Justice

Washington, D. C. 20000

Dear Sir:

After exhausting my administrative remedies, I filed c.

2301-70 in Federal district court in Hashington.

In it I

sought the

described spectrographic analyses made by the FBI

for the Warren Commission which had been denied me.

The law has now been amended. I herewith request that you

reinstitute this application for these analyses under the law

as amended.

„The Department saw fit in this previous case to make misrepre-

sentations to the courts.

I therefore want it to be

clear

that I sought and now seek only the final scientific reports

on these tests.

Not raw materials, not laboratory work, only

the conclusions as embodied in the

full report, or the report

itself.

Herewith I expand that request to include similar neutron-

activation testing, whother or not by the FBI, of those same

objects and materials, namely the bullet allegedly used in

the assassination, various fragments of bullet also allegedly

so used, and the various objects said to have

been in contact

with any or all of these. Here also my request is for the

complete report only.

Very truly yours,

Haulalse

the spectographic analyses were made by FBI Special

Even though i: Gallagher testified In deposition

form before the Warren Comnission, he

was asked no questions about

the spectographic analyses made os

the bullets and metal fragments.

(Hearings Before The Warren Commission, VOl: XV, DP: 746-52).

9. The testiniony ze the said analysos was given by

another FBI Special Agent, Robert à. Frazer, (Hearings Before the

Marren Connission, Vol. V. PD: 58-74).

10, At page 74 of his testimony, Mi. Irazer said thai

the bullets and fragments listed in paragraph 6, suora, were

"similar in metallic composition" but refused tp say that they were

identical,

11. It Is not known whether the fBI turned over the

speciographic analyses of the bullets and fragments or a copy

thereof to the Warren Commission or not; although they were

requested to do so by the Commission (Commission Report, p. XI).

12.

However, if the analyses were turned over to the

Warren Comnission, the Commission In turn did noü deposit then in

the National Archives, although all of the rest of lts materials

15. During 1966, 196%; 1968, and 1969 Plaintifi made

numerous requests, both orally and in writing, of the National

Archives (which should have had a ccopy of the analyses, but main

tains that it does not) and the Department of Justice to examine

and/or copy the analyses.

18e On Juno 4, 1990, the Astorney General replied to

Plaintife's letter of April 6, 1970, denying him access to ine

spectographic analyses, stating that they were exempt fron public

disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552 as a part of an "investigatory file

compiled for law enforcement purposes." According to the Attorney

General, they were exempt fron compulsory disclosure under excep

tion No. T of that Act. (Sea Exhibic l appended hereço.)

19. In a lettar dated June 12, 1970, the Deputy Attorney

General took an identical position, denying access under 5 u.s.c.

AFFIDAVIT

I, Jöhn W. Kilty, being auly sworn, depose as follows:

1. I am a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of

.. Investigation (FBI) assigned to the Laboratory Division of the....

FBI, Washington, D. "C., in a supervisory capacity... This affidavit:

supplements my previous affidavit of May 13, 1975:

2. I have personal knowledge concerning the contents of

Paragraphs 26-29, inclusive, of plaintiff's affidavit dated June 2,

1975, wherein plaintiff alleges numerous documents falling within

his Freedom of Information Act. (FOIA) request have not been furnished

him.

3. Concerning plaintiff's allegation that he has not been

given the "spectrographic testing" of "small foreign metal smears. on

a piece of curbing": the Laboratory work sheet which wäs previously

furnished plaintiff and from which he quotes is the notes and results

of this test. A thorough search has uncovered no other material con-

cerning the spectrographic.testing. or the metal smear on the curbing.

14. Concerning plaintitf's allegation that he has not been

given; the "microscople. sudy" rererred to at the bottom of page two

off an August 12, 1964, letter from J. Edgar Hoover. to J. iLee Rankin,

which letter has also been furnished plaintifi:. a tnorough search

has uncovered no additional documents concerning a study of this type.

5. Concerning plaintiff's allegation

that he has not

been furnished "a Laboratory report apparently dated December. 5,

1963": inasmuch as plaintiff has indicated he did not wish to

receive our reports which are already available to the public,

but rather the data compiled as input to these reports, this report

was not furnished to him

This material is available to the public

as Commission Document No: 205, pages 153-154... i-

6. Concerning plaintiff's allegation that, although the

date of: all the neutron activation analysis NÁẠ) documents furnished

him is May 15, 1964, there is an indication that this technique was.

already being utilized as early as January 10, 1964: the earlier NAA!

the quote from Mr. Rankin in Paragraph 27 of plaintiff's affidavit to

the contrary notwithstanding; was conducted won paraffin casts taken

of Lee Harvey Oswald's hands and cheek..

"Plaintiff requested NAA-

material concerning metal fragments only. No neutron activation

analysis of the metal fragments was made prior to May 15, 1964.

7. Concerning plaintiff's allegation that there may have

been NAA' testing subsequent to May 15, 1964: to prevent any further

misunderstanding concerning NAA technique, it should be noted that

the date written on the 'NAA' documents furnisted plaintiff refers to

the date irradiation of the metal fragments was conducted. The

compilation of other data appearing on these documents would have •

of necessity occurred after the date of irradiation. :.

8. Concerning plaintiff's allegation that, although NAA

testing was conducted on the clothing of President Kennedy and;

Governor Connally, he has not been furnished the results of this

This memorandun concerns itsolf with paragraph 27

in Heisberg's Memorandum of Points and Authorities wherein

Weisberg quotes a letter dated January 10, 1964, fron

J. Edger Hoover to J. Lee Rankin and comments nade by Rankin

at an executive session of the Warren Cormission on

January 27, 19644

In regard to the first point, Director Hoover"s

letter states that "work is already in progress applying"

neutron activation analysis "to certain phases of the current

investigation."

An examination of portinent laboratory files

and notes shows that NIA was being used at this time to

examine paraffin casts fron the hands and check of Oswald.

NaA was not being employed at this time for the examination

of any matal fragments involved in this case.

In regard to the second point, Pankin states that

the AEC was conducting examinations on

"bullet fragnents"

"by a now method" and "chey have had it for the better

of two and a half wooks and we ought to get an ansver part

examination of pertinent Laboratory files and notes shows

that the metal fragments were not submitted to examination by

NAA until May 15, 1964.

Woisberg has never requested the iM data on the

paraffin casts fron Oswald and has been given the data on the

examination of the metal fragments.

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION (FOIA)

REQUEST OF HAROLD WEISBERG

Reference is made to Stack to Cochran memorandum

dated June 16, 1975.

Former SA William R. Heilman conducted the spectrographic

examination of a lead smear removed from a curbstone in the

investigation of the John F. Kennedy assassination. On June 19, 1975,

SA John W. Kilty of the Laboratory telephonically contacted Mr. Heilman

for the purpose of determining if the notes made by him concerning

his examination and available in the Oswald file are complete. He

advised that normally he would construct a "table" to record the

relative concentrations of the eliments he measured on a spectrographic

plate so that it would facilitate intercomparisons between samples.

However, in this case, as he recollects, he ran only one sample and

the important part of the examination was to determine if the smear

was in fact lead. The notes he made on the worksheet reflect that

he detected lead with a trace of antimony and that no copper was

observed.

Mr. Hellman stated that he does not know the whereabouts

of the spectrographic plate he made. He advised that it is probable

that it was destroyed along with other plates which are disposed of

periodically according to polpey set down in Bufile 62-38539.

Mr. Hellman advised that if it were required he would make

an affidavit stating substantially the foregoing.

ACTION: None. For information only.

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION (FOIA)

REQUEST OF HAROLD WEISBERG

By letter dated March 31, 1975, to James B. Lesar, Esd.,

attorney for Weisberg, the Bureau released five pages of documents

in the John F. Kennedy assassination Investigation. These five pages

related to the examination of a curbstone and are enclosed with this

memorandum.

As can be noted on the first page of the Laboratory worksheet,

lead smears from the curbstone were examined spectrographically.

In a Memorandum of Points and Authorities filed in U. S, District

Court for the District of Columbia, Welsberg has asked for "this

spectrographic testing. " An exhaustive search of pertinent files,

and storage locations has not turned up the spectrographic plates

nor the notes made therefrom. Therefore, by affadavit, Kilty can

say that the FBI Laboratory has turned over to Weisberg all the

material it has concerning the spectrographic examination of the

lead smears from the curbstone.

ACTION: None. For information only.

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION (FOIA)

REQUEST OF HAROLD WEISBERG

Weisberg has initiated action in U. S. District Court

to have stricken an affi davit executed by Special Agent John W.

Kilty. Among the numerous reasons given are two which are

discussed in this memorandum.

The first concerns the "microscopic study" referred to

in the last paragraph of page two of the attached Hoover to Rankin

letter. Weisberg contends that this "study" was not furnished him.

Weisberg's requests by letter and by personal interview were

limited to the spectrographic analysis of lead smears from the

curbstone. The Laboratory has available a single page worksheet

prepared by former SA Lyndal Shaneyfelt concerning examinations

he made which may be applicable to the "microscopic study. " This

page is enclosed.

The second reason concerns the fact that Weisberg was

not given an FBI Laboratory report dated December 5, 1963, which

contains the results of examinations on the clothing of the President.

Weisberg did not request this report. He requested the worksheets

and notes concerning these examinations and he was furnished these

worksheets and notes. According to Mr. Marion Johnson, U. S. Archives,

the results of the Laboratory examination of the President's clothing

are set out in Commission Document 205, pages 153-154. This is

available to the public.

ACTION: None. For information only.

is further corroborated by the reference to these tests made by

Warren Commission General Counsel J. Lee Rankin at the Commission's

January 27, 1964, executive session:

Now, the bullet fragments are now, part

of them

are now, with the Atomic Energy

Commission, who

are trying to determine by

• a new method, a process that they have, of

whether they can relate them to various

guns and the different parts, the frag-

ments, whether they are à part of one of

the bullets that was broken and came out in

part through the neck,

just what par-

ticular assembly of bullet they were part

They have had it for the better part of

two ard

a-half weeks and we oughi to get an

answer.

[See Exhibit E to the Complainti

28

In addition, I also have reason to believe that other

NAA testing should have been done after May 15th. Yet I have not

been

given any NAA testing done after that date.

29.

FBI Director Kelley's April 10, 1975, letter to Mr.

Lesar, a copy of which is attached to the Kilty affidavit, states

that the FBI has responded fully to my request for the spectro

graphic and NAA

testing. Director kelley's letter also lists the

NAA-tested items on which I have been givin "irradiation data and

calculations".. This list does not incluâ. NAA tests performed on

the clothing of President Kennedy or Governor Connally. Yet

Special Agent Kilty's affidavit states in its

seventh paragraph

that:

"Neutron activation analysis and e nission spectroscopy

were used to determine the elemental comp. sition of the borders

and edges of holes in clothing ..."

Beause I have not been

given any NAA testing of any clothing, Mr Kilty's affidavit is

false and deceptive. It also contradicts Mr. Kilty's and Direc-

tor Kelley's assertions that the FBI has fully complied with my

request. For the NAÀ testing. I believe tiis court should address

itself to the question of perjury.

waived my claim to the neutron activation analysis (NAA) of the

clothing of Presidant Kennedy and Governor Connally as is sug

gested by the wording of paragraph 4-b.

2.6

•Paragraph five of the Kilty affidavit refers to the ma-

terials listed by Agent Kilty in paragraph four and then

states:

"All

available data relating to the above consists of 22 pages

also furnished Mr. Lesar by SA Bresson on Karch 31, 1975." Unless

there has been destruction of evidence, this is false.

FOr

example, one of the documents given me is & partially masked copy

of a letter from J. Edgar Hoover to Warren Commission General

Counsel J. Lee Rankin. Attached to that letter is a laboratory

work sheet which reports that "small foreign metal smears" on a

piece of curbing "were run spectrographically (Jarrell-Ash)". I

have not been given this spectrographic testing. Nor have I been

given the microscopic study referred to at the bottom of page two

of this same Hoover letter. Similarly, another document provided

me refers to a lab report apparently dated "12/5/63": I have not

been given that report either.

27

Nor has the FBI provided me with all the materials re-

lating to the neutron activation analyses which were made. All of

the VAA documents which I have been given hear a date of May 15.

However, in his January 10, 1964, Jetter to MI. Rankin, FBI Direc-

tor J. Edgar Hoover stated:

The FBI Laboratory is well acquainted

with the analytical technique of neutron

activation analysis.

Through arrangements

worked out with Dr.

Glenn T. Seaborg,

Chairman of the Atomic Energy Cormission,

work is already in progess applying this

technique to certain phases of the current

investigation. (Emphasis added. See.

From this it is evident that NAA testing wis performed long before

the May 15 date on the documents which the FBI has given me. This

AT ADMINISTRATION

February 14, 1975

James H. Lesar, Esquire

S.H.

1231 Fourth Street 20024

Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Lesar:

Please refer to your November 11, 1974, letter and subsequent telephone

conversations with Ralph Goldenberg of this office regarding work

performed by the Atomic Energy Commission in support of the Warren

Commission's investigation into the assassination of President Kennedy.

The information contained in my October 16, 1974, letter was based

primarily on advice we obtained from the former FBI agent who participated

in the work described. He now advises that, in addition to the analyses

of paraffin casts mentioned in that letter, neutron activation analyses

of bullet fragments were performed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory

(now the Holifield National Laboratory). As in the case of the paraffin

cast analyses, the bullet fragment analyses were done for the FBI

and with FBI participation.

We are advised that neither AEC nor ORNL prepared any report on the

results of the bullet fragment analyses.

However, we understand they

yielded no meaningful information additional to that provided by the

emission spectroscopic analyses of the fragments done at the FBI

Laboratory.

For further information on the results of either the neutron activation

analyses or the emission spectroscopic analyses, we suggest you contact

the FBI by writing to Clarence M. Kelley, Director, Federal Bureau

of Investigation, Washington, D. C.

If you believe we can be of any further assistance, please do not

hesitate to contact us.

Sincerely,

T3EH.5i.-

HAROLD WEISBERG,

Plaintiff,

UNITED STATES DEPARIMENT OF JUSTICE, et al.,

Defendants

AFFIDAVII

I, John W. Kilty being duly sworn, depose as follows:

1. I am a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation (FBI) assigned to the Laboratory Division of the

FBI, Washington, D. C., In a supervisory capacity.

2.. I have personal knowledge that Harold Weisberg

directed a Freedom of Information Act request

to the FBI for

documents relating to spectrographie and neutron activation

analysis examinations conducted in the John F. Kennedy

assassination case.

On March I4, 1975, I was present at a meeting

with Mr. Weisberg, his attorney, Mr. James H. Lesar, and two

other representatives of the FBI, SAs Robert A. Frazier and

Thomas H. Bresson. The purpose of this meeting was to identify

specifically the scope of Mr. Weisberg's request since he had

been

advised that all final reports with regard to the requested

data had been furnished to the Warren Commission and are available

to the public.

4. At this meeting Mr. Weisberg requested the

following:

a. Specific spectrographic and neutron activation

material which consists of tables and pages with results of

readings, representing examinations of metal fragments from the

bodies of President Kennedy and Governor Connally.

bo Spectrographic analysis from the areas on

the clothing of President Kennedy and Governor Connally where

the bullets may have passed.

c. Avallable material relating to examination

of the windshield of the President's automobile and examina-

tions regarding netal fragments from the President's automobile.

do Laboratory examination data which may be

avallable regarding testing done on a curbstone near the

crime scene.

5. All available data relating to the above consists

of 22 pages also furnished to kir. Lesar by SA Bresson on

March 31, 1975.

6. I have personal knowleäge that Mr. Lesar thereafter

advised the FBI's Freedom of Information Unit that lix. Weisberg

had intended his request as defined at the neating of Narch 14,

1975, to Include certain data which was shown to him at the close

of that meting. This material, consisting of 54 pages of data

and results of neutron activation examinations conducted on

certain metal fraguents fron the body of President Kennedy, the

stretcher, and the Fresident's autonobile, Is referred to in a

letter from Director Clarence M. Kelley to Mr. Lesar dated

April 10, 1975, and attached hereto. All this material was

furnished to Mr. Weisborg by letter from Director Kelley to

Mr. Lesar dated April 15, 1975, a copy of which 1s also attached.

7. With regard to the Interrogatories submitted by

Mr, Weisberg, the effiant, states that the FUI Laboratory employed

methods of clemental analysis, namely neutron activation analysis

and emission spectroscopy. Neutron activation analysis and

emission spectroscopy were used to determine the elemental compo-

sition of the borders and edges of holes In clothing and metallic

shears present on a windshield and a curbstone.

8. I have conducted a review of FOI files which would

contain information that Nr. Weisberg has rcquested under the

Freedom of Information Act. I have had compiled the materials

response to his specific reguest for tables and pages with

renuits of apectrographic and neutron activation testing.

lasar's position now is there must be a misunderstanding.

concerning this, and that Meisberg's request includes

this taw data.

As has been previously reported, Heisberg's FOIA

request is currently the subject of litigation in U. S.

Distriot court for the Distriot of colmbia. the issues

Iaised by HI. Lesar have been discussed with Mr. Jeffrey Axalrad,

Civil Division, Depariment of Justice, and Kichael Ryan.

Assiatant U. S. Attorney, District of Columbia. Boch

indicate our decision to withhold the identifying data

regarding bureau officials in the merorandun to Mr. Rankin

dated August 12, 1964, is defendable, but that it would

of course be open to discretionary release.

The problem concernin

the additional laboratory data which we clain was not

included in Weisberg's request at tha meeting of March l4th,

and which weisberg now clains was within the scope, bas nor

SUBJECT:

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA) REQUEST OF

HAROLD WEISBERG

dated March 13th

By memorandum/from Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B.

Adams under the above caption it was advised discussion

with Mr. Weisberg concerning his request for laboratory

data connected with the John F. Kennedy assassination

investigation was planned for March=z 14th. This is to

advise of the results.

Mr. Weisberg was accompained by his attorney, James

H. Lesar of Washington, D. C.

Representing the FBI were

SA Thomas H. Bresson of the FOIA Unit, Legal Counsel Division,

SAs Robert A. Frazier and John W. Kilty of the Laboratory

Division.

This discussion resolved what apparently was

Mr. Weisberg's confusion as to what data, other than that

which had been furnished to the National Archives, was in

existence and in possession of the FBI. After the data

generally identified for him, and samples shown to him,

he made specific requests for spectographic and neutron

activation material which consists of tables and pages with

results of readings, representing metal fragments from the

body of President Kennedy and the body of Governor Connolly.

Additionally requested were spectographic analyses data of

the areas on the clothing of President Kennedy and Governor

Connolly where the bullets may have passed.

Weisberg also

requested the available material relating to examination of

the windshield of the President's automobile, and examinatior

regarding metal fragments from the President's automobile.

Additional request was made for laboratory examination data

which may be available regarding testing done on a curbstone

near the crime scene.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams memo

Re:

FOIA Request of Harold Weisberg

Both Mr. Weisberg and Mr. Lesar indicated this

would be completely satisfactory to them and would cover

the scope of the current FOIA request with regard to labo-

ratory data in the Kennedy assassination case.

With regard to the above request, the documents

proposed for release are not considered to be material that

would be subject to withholding under the current FOIA. It

is estimated it will contain approximately 20-30 copied pages,

and a preliminary estimate of a full-work day to search and

compile. We would be authorized to charge ten cents per copy

for reproduction, and $2 per quarter hour for search and pro-

duction of the documents, this being the fee specified in

regulations for a non-clerical type search..

Discussion thereafter continued with SA Bresson

regarding FOIA matters

civil suit. Mr. Lesar generally and specifically the pending

stated that receipt of the requested

documents would moot the civil litigation with regard to labo-

ratory documents.

Mr. Weisberg then attempted to formulate some addi-

tional

FOIA requests regarding the Kennedy assassination

investigative file regarding

¡ events in Dallas and investigation

of Lee Harvey Oswald.

He also indicated he plans to pursue

further the Martin Luther King assassination case, including

laboratory findings, and some general data of historical

interest to him that he claims he furnished the FBI many

years ago. Mr. Weisberg was informed, and he understands,

that

any future FOIA request will have to be submitted in

writing in accordance with the Departmental regulations.

Mr. Lesar made reference to a letter we sent to

him dated 2/27 in response to his letter of 1/29 which he

directed to the then Acting Attorney General Laurence Silberman.

He felt the reply was not responsive to his question, and that

it particularly did not address the issue as to whether infor-

mation concerning Mr. Weisberg had ever been furnished to former

Congressman Hale Boggs.

He advised he would pursue this matter

further indicating he did not feel a reply based mainly on the

search of records was

sufficient in this case.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams memo

Re:

FOIA Request of Harold Weisberg

attached, contained in addition to the Boggs question, a

request for reply to what was identified as previously

unanswered inquiries as to whether Weisberg was subject

to surveillance or other intrusions into his life by the

FBI.

The reply, copy attached, was based on review of

the Weisberg. file and references in indices to him, and

advised

I generally that FBI records contained no informa-

tion to substantiate this.

During this conference Mr. Weisberg specifically

asked if "Director Hoover's confidential files" were searched

and the reply was that as far as is known, the appropriate

Illes that would reflect the type of requested intormation,

if lt existed, were checked and no information to substantiate

the allegations was found.

Mr. Lesar asked if any contact

was made with the son of Hale Boggs to verify this, and he

was answered that we did not.

The "OC" file was not checked initially, but on

3/14 it was determined there is no reference to Weisberg

contained therein.

Results of this discussion, insofar as the pending

civil litigation is concerned was furnished to Mr. Jeffrey

Axelrad of the Civil Division of the Department on 3/14 and

to Assistant United States Attorney Michael Ryan, who is

handling the case. Mr. Axelrad was advised we still had

not received a copy of this complaint, and he stated he

would insure we would receive it promptly.

RECOMMENDATION:

The requested documents be processed by Laboratory

Division and coordinated with FOIA Unit for determination of

charges and release.

As you know, captioned subject recently reinstitutedcrs.'-

his Freedon of Information ict (FOIA) request for

laboratory documents pertinent to the John F. Kennedy

assassination investigation under the amended version of the

Act. His request was submittod two months prior to the effective

date of the amendnents. On December 19th a letter vas directed

to him advising we were attempting

to identify the documents

in which he expressed interest, and that we were, at

Ile consiúered

this reply a denial and appealed.

By letter

to him dated

February 25th, the

Attorney Goneral upheld our decision to

jefer final disposition of his raquest until the effective

date of the amended FOIA, and suggested that he confer with

the FBI directly since there vas some

question as to the scope

of his request.

By letter dated March 6th, James H. Lesar, Weisberg's

attorney throughout his efforts to obtain data regarding the

Kennedy assassination case, directed a letter to us suggesting

we set an appropriate time to discuss this matter. le included

the request that weisberg, and the bureau, be allowed to tape

record the conference.

We learned on larch 10, 1275, through the Civil Division

of

the Justice Department, that weisberg has recently filed civil

suit in U. S. District Court for the District of Colunbia

regarding production of those documents. A copy of this

complaint is being forwarded to the FOIA Unit.

A meeting with Lesar and Heisberg has been set for

the morning of March 14, 1975, for the purpose of identifying

the scope of weisherg's request and discussion concerning

the nature of data which may be available for relcase under the

FOIA. The laboratory vorl: data and findings are not considered

to be exempt from disclosure under the amended FOIA. Ill. Lesar

was auvised the bureau did not intend to tape record the

conference ant it was our desire that weisherg not tape record

the discussion.

Mx. Lesar agreed there will be no tape recording.

DETAILS:

On 8/12/76, plaintiff served a copy

of attached Request for Production

of Documenta by Detendant Inited States Departrant of

Justice upon the hUsA handling this case, but the MuSh

did not aavise the FBI of this or furnish us a copy until

9/17/76. the roquest concorns records relating to

laboratory craminations conducted with regard to the

ascassination of President Kennedy, as well as plaintiff's

FOIA request for materials reinting to those examinations.

The FOIPA Section is being requested to locate all records

which would be responsive to this Inquest, so that a

determination can be made as to which of these records

shoule be turned over to nlaintili.

Spedial Agent John

Kilty of the laboratory Divicion has alrcady advised

Special Agent Parle Thomas Ilake of the Legal Counsel

Division that the INI possesses no records which would

be responsive to paragraph 3 of the request, and has

also advised that he will assist the FOIPA section in

making any detominations as to whether specific documents

located rould refer to the types of laboratory examinations

which are within the scope of plaintiff's FOIl request.

Special Agont lilty will also answer the Laboratory

related questions in plaintift's First Set of Interroga-

tories.

Special ngent Ilake previously furnished

a copy of this request to Spocial Agent Donald I. Snith of

Re :

Harold Weisberg v. United

States

Department of Justice, et al.

(U.S.в.С., D.С.)

Civil Action No. 75-226

President John I. Kennedy was not complied with to his satis-

and detailed set of interrogatories primarily directed toward

our laboratory procedures.

Based on affidavits provided by

us, defendants moved to dismiss the action on the grounds of

mootness, and on 7/15/75, the District Court granted defen-

dants' motion, stating that the interrogatories were overly

oppressive to

defendants, who had substantially complied with

plaintiff's request.

Plaintiff appealed to the District of Columbia

Circuit, and attached decision is the result of that appeal.

The Circuit Court in its decision implies that plaintiff, in

this FOIA litigation, is entitled to learn from former FBI

personnel, through subpocnaed testimony and/or depositions,

whether the records which appropriate present FBI personnel

have already sworn do not exist, do in fact exist.

newed his request for scientific investigatory data com-

piled

after the assassination of President Kennedy and

the rounding of Governor Connally, alleged to be in the

files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the

United States Energy Research and Development Admin-

istration (formerly the Atomic Energy Commission). In

the course of this renewed litigation under the Freedom

of Information Act plaintiff made certain demands for

the production of information and addressed interroga-

tories to the Department of Justice.

After back

In hearings held on 21 May and 15 July 1975, the

ment to respond to plaintiff Weisberg's interrogatories,

which it described as "oppressive,"s found that the Gov-

mands," and accordingly granted defendants' motion to

dismiss the action as moot." The Government defendants'

position, sustained by the District Court, was that all

data which existed and which had been described in

plaintiff's request had been furnished, and that other

data for which Weisberg repeated his demands did

not

exist. Before reaching this overall conclusion that the

Government defendants had "complied substantially," the

trial court made no detailed findings of fact, nor did it

list any material relevant facts as not in dispute and

relied upon to support a summary judgment.

In response to his demands in this Freedom of Infor-

mation Act suit plaintiff has received letters from Gov-

ernment officials, affidavits from Government employees,

some scientific data which he requested, and other scien-

tific data which he maintains he did not request and

does not need; he has had conferences with Goreinment

officials; and he has heard the statements and arguments

of Government counsel in court. He has not received all

of the data which he has demanded and which hel claims

still to exist or to have existed at one time. He Has not

received an answer to any of his interrogatories, nor

has he had the opportunity to examine a single live

witness either on deposition or on trial before the Dis-

trict Court.

assertians, or zesponses, but we have identified perime

demands which appear not to have been answered satis-

factorily by the Government defendants; i.e., demands

Which raise material factual questions still in dispute.

1. Final reports of spectrographic analysis The FBI

claims it does not have such "final reports" as sought by

Weisberg. The FBI asserts that Special Agent Gallagher

made an oral report of spectrographic analysis to Spe-

cial Agent Frazier, who incorporated the oral report in

a 'comprehensive report to the Dallas police, which is a

public document, and which has been turned over to

Weisberg. The Government asserts this is all there is.

• Special Agents Gallagher and Frazier are now retired

from. the FBI but both are living, yet no testimony or

affidaviti has been reçeived from them.

2. Neutron activation analyses of bullet fragments

• The FBI asserts that these were very small samples and

hare been turned over to Weisberg. Plaintiff thinks there

is more.: The analyses were performed at the Oak Ridge

National Laboratory with FBI participation. Apparently

no one with personal knowledge of this has testified cr

furnished affidavits. The Government representative fur-

nishing information by letter to plaintiff originally fur-

nished incorrect information, which subsequently was

corrected.

3. Ra data of the spectrographic and neutron activa-

tion analysis tests-Weisberg claims that some of this

has been withheld, particularly raw data on the Jarell-

Ash spectrographic analysis.

The FBI maintains that

the only report of this is on a worksheet already fur-

nished Weisberg, and that the Jarrell-Ash spectrographic

analysis results are on that worksheet.

4. Neutron activation analysis testing of clothing—

Plaintiff maintains he has been promised the results of

such testing and that he has not received this, although

Ethat he has received certain related materials

5

from the National Archives. The FBI responds that the

neutron activation analysis testing has not been furnished

because it was never done, and that the statement in the

original affidavit mentioning such testing was an

edges of holes in clothing and metallic smears present on

a windshield and a curbstone. The FBI maintains that

the results were inconclusive and such results as the FBI

has were furnished in the spring of 1975 as part of the

raw data given Weisberg.

The above listing is probably not all of the factual

areas which are in dispute between the parties, but the

listing of these five indicates that summary judgment

was clearly inappropriate. The Government's assertion

to the District Court that the "[elase has been séttled

by fully producing all material sought by plaintiff's

Freedom of Information Act request

.. that is, all

laboratory data concerning the John F. Kennedy assassi-

nation investigation" was certainly unwarranted.! The

Government's effort to respond to plaintifi's request has

consisted of furnishing information by affidavits executed

information

by agents now in the employ of the FBI who have exam-

ined the Bureau's files. None of these agents partici-

pated in the original investigation, and there are at

least three agents, retired from the FBI and identified

by plaintiff, who have not been heard by deposition; affi-

davit, or in court.

the whole story, but it was chosen as a preliminary first

step to outline parameters of discovery and as being the

most economical means available to plaintiff. We think

in these circumstances plaintiff was entitled to insist on

his interrogatories being answered and that they should

not have been dismissed by the trial judge as oppressive.

It may be that plaintiff would now be well advised,

given the totality of discovery, irregular as it may be,

which he has been afforded, to proceed with depositions

or a court hearing? Certainlvlaintifi later must do so.

Although the choice of discove

amerods is normally up

to the litigant, we cannot.cat

blame on. the Gov-

ernment defendants here. Pay

She reason for plain-

tif obtaining unsatisfactory asponses undoubtedly lies

in the fact that plaintiff has been addressing inquiries

only to the opposing parties, who by this date in history

are nothing but file custodians with no personal knowl-

edge of the matters in issue.

The data which plaintiff seeks to have produced, if it

exists, are matters of interest not only to him but. to

the nation. Surely their existence or nonexistence should

• be determined speedily on the basis of the best available

evidence, i.e., the witnesses who had personal knowledge

of events at the time the investigation was made. This

cannot be done by interrogatories addressed to a party,

although this might serve to narrow the scope of inquiry.

It must be done with live witnesses either by deposition

or in court.

Dean Wigmore said that cross-examina-

tion "is beyond any doubt the greatest legal engine ever

• While we think the trial judge should not have quashed

the interrogatories in toto as "oppressive," we do not rule

out a detailed evaluation of individual questions, if

invented for the discovery of truth."s We think it time

for the trial court to start the engine running, and there-

after make detailed findings as to what the evidence

adduced establishes. Accordingly, we remand this case

to the District Court for further proceedings under the

Freedom of Information Act not inconsistent with this

opinion.

This is to confirm the substance of the

telephone conversations on January 14, 1976, between

Mr. Michael HI. Stein of the Civil Division and Special

Agent Parle Thónas Blake of our Legal Counsel Division.

It will

be recalled that Mr. Weisberg instituted

suit in the United. States District Court for the District

of Columbia, and one of his allegations was that thei:

FBI had failed to comply with his request, made pursuant

to the Freedon of Information Act (FOIA), for FBI Labora-

tory reports concerning the assassiration of President

John F. Kennedy:

Our position was that Mr. Weisberg

had

in fact been furnished all material we had been able to.

locate which responded to his request.

On July 15, 1975,

United States District Court Judge John Il. Pratt granted

defendants' motion to dismiss the action as moot.

on September 8, 1975, Mr. Weisberg filed his

Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals

for the District of Columbia, although we were not aware

of this until advised of same by Mr. "stein in his

NOTE:

See memorandum of Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams

dated June 23, 1975, captioned "Freedom of Information

Act (FOIA) Request Of Harold Weisberg", which set out

three possible problems presented to the FBI by this

litigation. In essence, these problems dealt with the

credibility of portions of our laboratory investigations

concerning the Kennedy assassination. Reference is also

made to the July 17, 1975, memorandum of Legal Counsel

to Mr. Adams, same caption, which indicated that Mr. Weisberg's

suit had been dismissed on July 15, 1975. The purpose

of this memorandum to the Department is to confirm in

writing the substance of the telephone conversations

reported herein, and, more importantly, to advise the

Department that, regardless of whether they need our

assistance when

a case in which we are involved is

appealed, we wish to be notified immediately whenever

a Notice of Appeal is filed in a case in which we are

either a defendant or have a

substantial interest in

its outcome. Copy of Mr. Weisberg's brief and the

LABORATORY ADDENDUM, JWK:fdb (Enclosures (7) March 5, 1976

The Laboratory conducted spectrographic examinations

of lead bullets removed from the body of Officer J. D. Tippit,

bullets from cartridges removed from lee Harvey Oswald's

revolvet,

and bullets from cartridges renoved from the pocket

Of Oswald's trousers. A search of pertinent files does not

reveal any information concerning neutron activation

analyses (NAA) being conducted on any of these items.

A search of pertinent files does not reveal the

existance of any information concerning an examination of

a button allegedly struck by a bullet.

There is no

information in the files concerning any examination of

Tippit's clothing.

.: Weisberg's letter of request is vague; however, it

appears that he is interested in analytical test results and

not firearms examinations inasmuch as he comments on tne

Inability to associate the bullets fron Tippit with Oswald's

gun "ballistically."

Therefore, the infornation recommended

for release to Weisberg will not include the notes and

worksheets concerning the firearms examinations.

The worksheets, notes and reports regarding the

spectrographic examinations of the previously mentioned items

do not identify the items easily for a person not faniliar

with the total use.

For that reason, a Dallas airtel

describing these items is being included in the material for

release. as

The following documents which appear to be responsive

to Weisberg's request are enclosed:

D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Number 78-1107

PURPOSE: To advise the Director of the 4/28/80 decision of

the United States Court of Appeals in captioned

litigation (copy attached).

SYNOPSIS AND DETAILS:

Plaintiff commenced this action in

2/75 to compel the DOJ and the Energy

Research

and Development Administration (ERDA), to disclose

the results of certain spectrographic, neutron

activation,

other scientific tests conducted by the defendants during

the investigation of the assassination of President John F.

Kennedy. The documents at issue in this lawsuit were

Information Act (FOIA) by letter dated 11/27/74.

On 7/15/75,

affidavits setting forth the Government's position that all

material responsive to this request had been identified and

provided

to plaintiff. The District of Columbia Court of

Appeals reversed this decision in 7/76, and remanded this

the District Court for further proceedings to

determine by either deposition or in Court testimony of the

"witnesses who had personal knowledge of events at the time

So an or use, ot el

the investigation was made" whether the alleged additional

data responsive to plaintiff's request existed.

Memorandum from Legal Counsel to The Director

Re: WEISBERG

participated in the scientific tests connected with the

investigation of President Kennedy's assassination.

Plaintiff

also attempted to depose SA John W. Kilty relative to the scope of

the search that had been

made of FBI files. (SA Kilty, prior to

the remand, executed two affidavits avowing that the FBI files

contained no information of interest to plaintiff other than that

already furnished to him.)

Defendants' Motion for a Protective Order in this regard, and

For a Protec Dive

The District Court granted the

ultimately awarded

Summary Judgment to the Defendants, holding

that all documents within

the purview of plaintiff's demands had

been released.

The record relied on by the court included, in

part, the two previously described

Kilty affidavits.

Plaintiff

appealed to the D.C. Court of Appeals.

On 4/28/80, the D.C. Court of Appeals

again reversed the

decision of the District Court, holding that material issues of

fact existed which made Summary Judgment improper.

Weisberg v.

Department of Justice,

et al., No.

78-1107 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 28,

1980).

The Court particularly questioned the

non-existence of at

least three items that should have been turned up during

FBI files, and commented that the agency affidavits

addressing the thoroughness of the search were inadequate in that

they "do not denote which files were searched or by whom, do not

reflect any systematic approach to document location, and do not

provide information specific enough to enable Weisberg to

challenge the procedures utilized." Id., 13-14.

further noted that "the District Court should have permitted him

to depose at least SA Kilty and perhaps others who examined the

files" Id., 14.

LCD does not anticipate that further appellate review of

this decision will be pursued by the DOJ, nor will such a

recommendation be formally made by the LCD. The LCD also does not

anticipate

that further

proceedings in this case in the District

Court is likely to result in the location of additional material

responsive to plaintiff's reguest; however, LCD expects that the

the records at issue

support a renewed motion for

summary juagment.

RECOMMENDATION: None.

For information.

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT

OF JUSTICE, et al.,

Defendants

Civil Action No. 75-0226

DEFENDANT UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S

ANSWERS TO PLAINTIFE'S FIRST SET OF INTERROGATORIFS

John W. Kilty, Special Agent, Federal Bureau of

Investigation (hereinafter FBI), being duly sworn, pursuant

to Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, hereby

answers the following Interrogatories.

These answers are

based on information available to a party

within the meaning

of Rule 33.

Interrogatory No. 1:

What are the

kinds of tests or

examinations, physical, chemical,

microscopic or otherwise, which would normally be conducted

to determine: (a) whether or not bullets or bullet fragments

have a common origin, or (b) which bullets or bullet fragments

struck which persons or objects?

Answer No. 1:

(a) Elemental analysis is used to

determine the composition of bullets

and bullet fragments. If, say, bullet A has the same compo-

sition as bullet B, our report would say that bullet A came

from

the same source (origin) of lead as bullet B or another

source of lead with the same composition as bullet B. This

does

not

associate bullet A with bullet B

to the exclusion of

all other

bullets. If bullet A is different in composition

from bullet B, we point out this

fact and say that bullet B

-1 -

, NW 54999 DocId: 32989522 Page

434

---

## Page 435

could not have come from the same source (origin) of lead as

bullet A; however, we point out that bullets of

more than one

composition are often represented in

a single box ổf amnuni-

tion.

Our haboratory and other laboratories have

demonstrated

that several different compositions of lead are often repre-

sented in a single box of cartridges.

The

two methods of

elemental analysis which were used in the Kennedy Assassination

case were emission spectroscopy and neutron activation analysis

(NAA) •

(b) There are no tests available

which will specifically associate

a bullet or bullet fragment to the exclusion of other bullets

or bullet fragments with a particular hole in a person or object.

There are tests available which will determine if

a hole in a

person or object, or a dent in an object, could have been caused

by being struck by a bullet. In this case, emission spectroscopy

was used

to determine the composition at the edges of

holes in

certain garments and to compare this composition with cloth used

as control taken from areas distant from these holes, and also

to determine the composition of metal scrapings from an automobile

windshield and curbstone.

Interrogatory No.

2:

Are there any additional tests which

, could have been used in the investigation

into the assassination of President Kennedy to help make these

determinations? If so, what are they?

Answer No. 2:

Making the assumption that positive

answers to interrogatories I(a) and 1(b)

are possible, there are no additional tests which could have been

used to help make these determinations in the Kennedy Assassina-

tion case.

Interrogatory No. 3:

Which of the tests listed in response

to the above interrogatories were per-

formed on the evidence pertaining to the assassination of

President Kennedy?

- 2-

NW 54999 DocId: 32989522 Page 435

## Page 436

Answer No. 3:

Emission spectroscopy and/or NAA were

performed on items pertaining to

interrogatory Ila) and emission spectroscopy was performed on

articles of clothing or other objects

relative to

interrogatory

1 (b) .

Interrogatory No. 4:

Were the tests conducted on the items

of evidence pertaining to the assassina-

tion of President Kennedy as complete. as they could have been?

Answer No. 4:

Interrogatory No. 5:

Yes.

List all items of evidence having to

do

with the shooting of President Kennedy

or any weapon used or allegedly used in the shooting, including

any and all bullets or bullet fragments and any objects struck

or allegedly struck by bullet or bullet fragments.

Give the

following information with respect to those items of evidence:

(a) the type of tests performed on each

such item of

evidence;

(b) the date or dates on which each such item of evidence

was tested

and the name of the laboratory in which the testing

was done;

(c) the name of the person or persons conducting each

such

test and the names of any other persons present during the

testingi

(a) the capacity, official on otherwise, in which the persons

listed in response to interrogatory 5(c) were present at such

testing; and

(e) the current address and employment of each person mamed

in response to interrogatory 5(c) .

Interrogatory No. 8:

Answer No. 8:

between

the FBI

and

the AEC.

No correspondence between the Atomic

Energy Commission

(AEC) -and the FBI

-was located in FBI records:

What are all the chemical components

of the bullet (CE399) allegedly used?

in the murder of President Kennedy?

CE 399 (Q1) was examined

for its

elemental composition. An examination

of records shows that the lead portion contained bismuth, copper,

magnesium, silicon, iron, silver and antimony. The jacket por-

tion contained tin, lead, copper, zinc, silicon, iron and silver.

Interrogatory No. 9:

Were all of these chemical components

tested in each of the tests made? If

not, why not?

## Page 442

Answer No. 9:

I am not able to answer this question

inasmuch' as I do not understand plain-

tiff's question.

See my answer to interrogatory 8 for a listing

of the elements in CE 399 (21).

Interrogatory No. 10:

What are the normal standards and

procedures for conducting neutron

activation analysis?

Answer No. 10:

NAA is a method of chemical analysis

based on the detection and measurement

of characteristic radionuclides produced in a nuclear reactor.

The procedures for conducting such an analysis are many and

varied depending on the material to be examined and the chemical

elements under investigation. Three texts which are publically

available and may be of assistance to plaintiff are Principles

of Activation Analysis by Paul Kruger, Applied Gamma Ray

"Spectrometry by Adams and Dams and Neutron Activation Analysis

by De Soete, Gijbels and Hoste. "Normal standards" as this term

is used in interrogatory 10 and applied

to NAA in general is not

understood by me.

Interrogatory No. 11:

Were the normal

standards

and procedures

followed with

respect to the testing

and

analysis

of items of evidence pertaining to the assassination of

President Kennedy?

Answer No. 11:

It is assumed that this interrogatory

refers to NAA. The procedures used to

examine the items of evidence by NAA were ones that would have

been employed by other practicioners given the same kinds of

materials with which to work.

Interrogatory No. 12:

Under normal circumstances, who

decides what is tested?

Answer No. 12:

Assuming that evidence is submitted to

Based on their experience and expertise, examiners

'in the FBI Laboratory will usually

determine the kinds of

examinations to perform on items of evidence.

Interrogatory No. 13:

With respect to the assassination

of President Kennedy, who decided

what was tested?

Answer No. 13:

Our records do not reveal "who

decided what was tested" in the

Interrogatory No. 14:

Kennedy assassination case.

In subjecting evidentiary specimens

to neutron activation testing, is it

normal to make a full and complete tabulation of the results?

In this case, was any such tabulation made? If so, was it

complete?

Answer No. 14:

It is "normal" to make a "tabulation"

of the results when subjecting speci

mens to NAA. By "results" I mean the numerical quantitative

amount of a chemical element measured in the material examined.

The use of the "full and complete" characterization of the

"tabulation" is not understood by me.. A "tabulation" was made

of the results obtained in the NAA of metal fragments in this

case. This was given to plaintiff and to the best

of my

knowledge is complete.

Interrogatory No. 15:

In making a neutron activation analysis,

is it normal to reach stated conclusions

as to whether the various evidentiary specimens are identical or

different in chemical composition?

Answer No. 15:

The conclusion one makes regarding

whether or not specimens are "identical

or different in chemical composition" is based on the data

available from whatever technique or

technigues

were employed in

the examination. In some cases, due

to the limited

size of the

material and/or its state of contamination and/or the character

of its composition, it is not possible to reach

an "identical

or different" conclusion. Additionally, the terms used to

describe the conclusion reached are the choice of the person

making the conclusion and may not necessarily be stated as

"identical" or "different." See my answer to interrogatory

I(a) •for a further discussion

regarding the conclusions

reached concerning elemental analysis of bullet fragments.

Interrogatory No. 16:

Were any such stated conclusions

made with respect to the items of

evidence tested by spectrographic or neutron

activation

analysis in this case?

Answer No. 16:

Interrogatory No. 17:

Consistent with my answer to inter-

rogatory 15 the answer is yes.

Were full and complete results of

¿the spectrographic and neutron acti-

vation tests given to the Warren Commission?

Commission ask for them?

Did the warren

Answer No. 17:

In interrogatory 14 I defined

"results" as the numerical quantitative

amount of a chemical element measured in the material examined.

This definition applied to NAA examinations.

An extension of

this definition for spectrographic "results"

would be the

relative concentration of a chemical element in the material

examined. Using these definitions, the "results of the spec-

trographic and neutron activation

tests"

were not given to the

Warren Commission. Based

on my review of the records, I

unable to determine if the Warren Commission asked for them.

Interrogatory No. 18:

Were full and complete stated conclu-

sions as to what the tests showed given

to the warren Commission? Did the warren Commission ask for

them?

Answer No. 18:

If by "full and complete stated conclu-

sions as to what the tests showed" the

plaintiff means our expert opinion as to what the results of the

spectrographic examinations and NAA indicated, the answer is yes.

Based on my review of the records, I am unable to determine if

the Warren Commission asked for them.

Was the neutron activation testing

done on any items of evidence in

the

Kennedy assassination other than the paraffin casts® and the

five Commission Exhibits--CE

399 (01), CE 567 (Q2) , CF 843

(Q4, 05), CE

1975, letter from FBI Director Clarence Kelley to Mr. James H..

Lesar?

Answer No. 19:

Interrogatory No. 20:

NO.

If the answer to interrogatory number

12 is affirmative, what are the other

items of evidence which were subjected to neutron activation

testing?

Answer No. 20:

-

Assuming plaintiff means to refer to

"interrogatory 19," no answer is

Interrogatory No. 21:

necessary.

If the answer to interrogatory number

12 (sic) is negative, why were the

following

items of evidence not subjected to neutron activation

testing:

(a) CE 141, the live round found

in the Mannlicher-Carcano

rifle which allegedly belonged to Lee Harvey Oswald

and fired

the shots which killed President Kennedy?

(b). the clothing of President Kennedy and Governor Connally

struck by or alleged to have been struck by bullets?

(c) the curbstone on the south side of S. Main Street east

of the Triple Underpass which was struck by bullet?

.. (a) the bullet fragment which is FBI Laboratory Number 03?

Answer No. 21:

(a) Our records do not indicate why CF 141 (08) was not

examined by NAA.

(b) Based on my experience and expertise, the reason the

clothing of President Kennedy

and Governor Connally was not

examined by NAA in the areas where a bullet allegedly passed is

because NAA is not the method of choice for the determination

of bullet holes. In 1963, emission spectroscopy was the

method of choice for elemental analysis of the borders of

• holes in garments.

•(c) Based on my experience and expertise and®an

examination,of the notes made regarding the spectrographic

analysis of the lead

smear on the curbstone, it is clear that

the minimal

amount of lead smear present on the curbstone was

not adequate to conduct an examination by NAA.

(d)

Records indicate that 23 is a section of bullet

jacket devoid of its lead core. Bullet jacket material made

of copper, zinc and/or iron is generally unsuitable for

examination by NAA unless chemical separations are conducted.

The chemical separations would necessarily destroy markings on

the item of evidence. Emission spectrographic analysis was the

method of choice for analysis of bullet jacket material in 1963.

Interrogatory No. 22:

Under normal procedures would the

results of the spectrographic or neutron

activation analyses be recorded and verified by someone other than

the person conducting the tests?

Was such a procedure followed

with respect

to the items of evidence tested by these techniques

in connection with the investigation into President 'Kennedy's

assassination?

Answer No. 22:

An examiner often

consults with

another

- examiner concerning his findings in a

specific case, but in all likelihood there would be no reason

to commit this consultation to record. An examination of records

does not indicate that more than one person recorded or verified

the results of the individual spectrographic or NAA examinations.

Interrogatory No. 23:

Was a full and complete comparison made

between the chemical composition of

CE 399, the bullet which allegedly wounded both President

Kennedy and Governor Connally and (a) the composition of the

metallic traces on President Kennedy's clothing, (b) the com-

position of the metallic traces on Governor Connally's clothing,

and (c) the composition of all fragments removed from Governor

Conally's body?

(a)

NO.

Referring to my answer to

interrogatory 1(b),

a "fuil and complete comparison" between

the composition

a bullet and the minute traces

of metal left at the

edges of

a hole will not permit the conclusion that the hole was made

by a specific bullet.

There were no metallic traces on Governor Connally's

clothing.

(c)

Our records indicate that only one fragment of lead

was removed from Governor Connally's body. The answer to this

portion of the interrogatory is yes.

Interrogatory No. 24:

Was a full and complete comparison made

between the chemical composition of the

bullet fragments recovered from President Kennedy's head

and (a)

the composition of the sweepings from the windshield, and (b)

all five fragments found in the car during two different searches?

Answer No. 24:

(a)

Yes, to the extent that the specimens were of adequate

size and condition for compositional

analysis.

(b) Our records indicate that the metal fragments recovered

from President Kennedy's head were lead and that the five frag-

ments found in the car consisted of a portion of a jacketed bullet

(core and" jacket), a bullet jacket and three lead fragments. It

is apparent from these records that a compositional comparison

was made where appropriate.

I. (a) Elemental analysis is used to determine the composition of

bullets and bullet fragments. If, say, bullet A has the same

composition as bullet E, our report would say that bullet A

came from the same source (origin) of lead as bullet B or another

source of lead with the same coposition as bullet B. This does

not associate bullet A with bullet B to the exclusion of all

other bullets. If bullet A is different in composition from

bullet B, we point out this fact and say that bullet B could

not have come from the same source (origin) of lead as bullet

A; however, we point out that bullets of more than one com-

position are often represented in the single box of ammunition.

Our Laboratory and other laboratories have demonstrated that

several different compositions of lead are often represented

in a single box of cartridges. The two methods of elemental

analysis which were used in the Kennedy Assassination case

were emission spectroscopy and neutron activation analysis

(NAA) .

1. (b) There are no tests available which will specifically associate

## Page 450

2.

3.

a bullet or bullet fragment to the exclusion of other bullets

or bullet fragments with a particular hole in a person or object.

There are tests available which will determine if a hole in a

person or object, or a dent in an object could have been caused

by being struck by a bullet. In this case, emission spectroscopy

was used to determine the composition at the edges of holes in

.

certain garments and to compare this composition with cloth

used as control taken from areas distant from these holes, and

also to determine the composition of metal scrapings from an

automobile windshield and curbstone.

Making the assumption that positive answers to interrogatories

1(a) and 1(b) are possible, there are no additional tests which

could have been used to help make these determinations in the

Kennedy Assassination case.

Emission spectroscopy and/or NAA were performed on items per-

taining to interrogatory l(a) and emission spectroscopy vas

performed on articles of clothing or other objects relative to.

interrogatory I (b).

CE 399 (Q]) was examined for its elemental composition. An

examination of records shows that the lead portion contained

bismuth, copper, magnesium, silicon, iron, silver and antimony.

The jacket portion contained tin, lead, copper, zinc, silicon,

iron and silver.

I am not able to answer this question inasmuch as I do not

understand plaintiff's question. See my answers to interrogatory

#8 for a listing of the elements in CE 399 (Q1).

NAA is a method of chemical analysis based on the detection

and measurement of characteristic radionuclides produced in

a nuclear reactor. The procedures for conducting such an

NW 54999 DocId: 32989522 Page 462

12.

analysis are many and varied depending on the material to be

examined and the chemical elements under investigation. Three

texts which are publically available and may be of assistance:

to plaintiff are Principles of Activation Analysis by Paul

Kruger, Applied Gamma Ray Spectrometry by Adams and Dams and

Neutron Activation Analysis by De Soete, Gijbels and Hoste.

"Normal standards" as it is used in interrogatory lf and applied

to NAA in general is not understood by me.

It is assumed that this interrogatory refers to NAA. The pro-

cedures used to examine the items of evidence by NAA were

ones that would have been employed by other practioners given

the same kinds of materials with which to work.

Assuming that evidence is submitted to the FBI Laboratory, the

contributer usually requests that certain items be examined to

.."

show relationships to one another and to somehow associate items

with a crime. Based on their experience and expertise, examiners

in the FBI laboratory will usually determine the kinds of

examinations to perform on items of evidence.

Our records do not reveal who decided "what was tested" in the

Kennedy assassination case.

It is "normal" to make a "tabulation" of the results when

subjecting specimens to NAA. By "results" I mean the numerical

quantitative amount of a chemical element measured in the

material examined. The use of the "full and complete"

characterization of the "tabulation" is not understood by me.

A "tabulation" was made of the results obtained in the NAA

of metal fragments in this case.

This was given to plaintiff

and to the best of my knowledge is complete.

The conclusion one makes regarding whether or not specimens

are "identical or different in chemical composition" is based

on the data available from whatever technique or techniques

were employed in the examination. In some cases, due to

the

limited size of the material and/or its state of contamination

and/or the character of its composition it is not possible to

reach an "identical or different" conclusion. Additionally,

necessarily be stated as "identical" or "different".

Consistent with my answer to interrogatory #15 the answer is

yes.

In interrogatory 14 I defined "results" as the numerical

quantitative amount of a chemical element measured in the

material examined. This definition applied to NAA examinations.

An extension of this definition for spectrographic "results"

would be the relative concentration of a chemical element in

the material examined. Using these definitions, the "results

of the spectrographic and neutron activation tests" were not

given to the Warren Commission. Based on my review of the

records, I am unable to determine if the Warren Commission

asked for them.

If by "full and complete stated conclusions as to what the

No answer necessary.

21. (a)

Records do not show or indicate why CE 141 (Q8) was not

21. (b)

Based on my experience and expertise, the reason the clothes

of President Kennedy and Governor Connally were not examined

by NAA in the areas where a bullet allegedly passed is because

NAA is not the method of choice for the determination of bullet

holes. In 1963, emission spectroscopy was the method of choice

for elemental analysis of the borders of holes in garments.

21. (c) Based on my experience and expertise

and an examination of

the notes made regarding the spectorgraphic analysis of the

lead smear on the curbstone, it is clear that the minimal

amount of lead smear present on the curbstone was not adequate

to conduct an examination by NAA.

It is apparent from these records that a compositional

comparison was made where appropriate.

Civil Action No. 75-0226

DEFENDANT UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S

ANSWERS TO PLAINTIFF'S FIRST SFT OF INTERROGATORIFS

John W. Kilty, Special Agent, Federal Bureau of

Investigation (hereinafter FBI), being duly sworn, pursuant

to Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, hereby

answers the following Interrogatories. These answers are

based on information available to a party within the meaning

of Rule 33.

Interrogatory No. I:

What are the kinds of tests of

examinations, physical, chemical,

microscopic or otherwise, which would normally be conducted

to determine: (a) whether or not bullets or bullet fragments

have a common origin, or (b) which bullets or bullet fragments

struck which persons or objects?

Answer No. 1:

(a) Elemental analysis is used to

determine the composition of bullets

and bullet fragments.

If, say; bullet A has the same compo-

sition as bullet B, our report would say that bullet A came

from the same source (origin) of lead

as bullet B or another

source of lead with the same composition as bullet B. This

does not associate bullet A with bullet B

to the exclusion of

all other bullets.

If bullet A is different

in composition

from bullet B, we point out this fact and

say

that bullet

=1 -

NW 54999

DocId: 32989522 Page 474

---

## Page 475

:

could not have come from the same source (origin) of lead as

bullet A; however, we point out that bullets of more than one

composition are often represented in a

single box of ammuni-

tion. Our Laboratory and other laboratories have

demonstrated

that

several different compositions of lead

are often

repre-

sented in. a single box of cartridges.

The two methods of

elemental analysis which were used in the Kennedy Assassination

case were emission spectroscopy and neutron activation analysis

(NAA) .

(b) "There are no tests available

which will specifically associate

a bullet or bullet fragment to the exclusion of other bullets

or bullet fragments with a particular hole in a person or object.

There are tests available which will determine if a hole in a

person or object, or a dent in an object, could have been caused

by being struck by a bullet. In this case, emission spectroscopy

was used

to determine the composition at the edges of holes in

certain garments and to compare this composition with cloth used

as control taken from areas distant from these holes, and

also

to determine the composition of metal scrapings from an automobile

windshield and curbstone.

Interrogatory No. 2:

Are there any additional tests which

could have been used in the investigation

into the assassination of President Kennedy to help make these

determinations? If so, what are they?

Answer No. 2:

Making the assumption that positive

answers to

interrogatories 1(a) and 1(b)

are possible, there are no additional

tests which could have been

used to help make these determinations in the Kennedy Assassina-

tion case.

Interrogatory No. 3:

Which of the tests listed in response

to the above interrogatories were per-

formed on the evidence pertaining to the assassination of

President Kennedy?

-2 -

NW 54999 DocId: 32989522 Page 475

## Page 476

Answer No. 3:

Emission spectroscopy and/or NAA were

performed on items pertaining to

interrogatory I(a) and emission spectroscopy was performed on

articles of clothing or other objects relative to interrogatory

1(b) .

Interrogatory No. 4:

Were the tests conducted on the items

of evidence pertaining to the assassina-

tion of President Kennedy as complete.as they could have been?

Answer No. 4:

Yes.

Interrogatory No. 5:

List rall items of evidence having to do

with the shooting of President Kennedy

or any weapon used or allegedly used in the shooting, including

any and all bullets or bullet fragments and any objects struck

or allegedly struck by bullet or bullet fragments. Give the

following

information with respect to those items of evidence:

(a) the type of tests performed on each such item of

evidence;

(b) the date or dates on which each such item of evidence

was tested and the name of the laboratory in which the testing

was done;

• (c)

the name of the person or persons

conducting each

such

test and

the names of any other persons present during

the

testing;

(a) the capacity, official or otherwise, in which the persons

listed in response to interrogatory 5(c) were present at such

testing: and

• (e) the current address and employment of each person named

in response to interrogatory 5(c).

No correspondence between the Atomic

Energy Commission (AEC) -and the FBI

-was located in FBI records:

What are all the chemical components

of the bullet (CE399) allegedly used

in the murder of President Kennedy?

CE 399 (Q1) was examined for its :

elemental composition. An examination

of records shows that the lead portion contained bismuth, copper,

magnesium, silicon, iron, silver and antimony. The jacket por-

tion contained tin, lead, copper, zinc, silicon, iron and silver.

Interrogatory No.

9:

Were all of these chemical components

tested in each of the tests made? If

not, why not?

1-8-

NW 54999 DocId:32989522 Page 481

## Page 482

Answer No: 9:

I am not able to answer this question

inasmuch' as I do not understand plain-

tiff's question. See my answer to interrogatory 8 for a listing

of the elements in CE 399 (li).

Interrogatory No. 10:

What are the normal standards and

procedures for conducting neutron

activation analysis?

Answer No. 10:

NAA is a method of chemical analysis

based on the detection and measurement

of characteristic radionuclides produced in a nuclear reactor.

The procedures for conducting such

an analysis are many and

varied depending on the material to be examined and the chemical

elements under investigation. Three texts which are publically

available and may be of assistance to plaintiff are Principles

of Activation Analysis by Paul Kruger, Applied Gamma Ray

"Spectrometry by Adams and Dams and Neutron Activation Analysis

by De Soete, Gijbels and Hoste. "Normal standards" as this term

is used in interrogatory 10 and applied to NAA in general is not

understood by me.

Interrogatory No. 11:

Were the normal

standards and procedures

followed

with respect to the

testing

and

analysis of items of evidence pertaining to the assassination of

President Kennedy?

Answer No. 11:

It is assumed that this interrogatory

refers to NAA. The procedures used to

examine the items of evidence by NAA were ones that would have

been employed by other practicioners given the same kinds of

materials with which to work.

Interrogatory No. 12:

Under normal circumstances, who

decides what is tested?

Answer No. 12:

Assuming that evidence is submitted to

the FBI Laboratory, the contributor

usually requests that certain items be examined

to show rela-

tionships to one another and to somehow

associate items with a

- 9 -

NW 54999 DocId: 32989522 Page 482

---

## Page 483

crime.

Based on their experience and expertise, examiners

in the FBI Laboratory will usually determine the kinds of

examinations to perform on items of evidence.

Interrogatory No. 13:

With respect to the assassination

of President Kennedy, who decided

what was tested?

Answer No. 13:

Our records do not reveal

"who

decided what was tested" in the

Kennedy assassination case.

Interrogatory No. 14:

In subjecting evidentiary specimens

to neutron activation testing, is it

normal to make a full and complete tabulation of the results?

In this case, was any such tabulation made? If so, was it

complete?

Answer No. 14:

It is "normal" to make a

"tabulation"

of the results when subjecting speci-

mens to NAA. By "results" I mean the numerical quantitative

amount of a chemical element measured in the material examined.

The use of the "full and complete" characterization of the

"tabulation" is not understood by me.. A "tabulation" was made

of the results obtained in the NAA of metal fragments in

this

case. This was given to plaintiff and to the best of my

knowledge is complete.

Interrogatory No. 15:

In making a neutron activation analysis,

is it normal. to reach stated conclusions

as to whether the various evidentiary specimens are identical or

different in chemical composition?

Answer No. 15:

The conclusion one makes regarding

whether or not specimens are "identical

or different in chemical composition"

is based on the data

available from whatever

technique or

techniques were employed in

the examination. In some cases, due to the limited

size of the

material and/or its state of contamination and/or the character

of its composition, it is not possible to reach an "identical

or different" conclusion. Additionally, the terms used to

- 10 -

NW 54999

DocId: 32989522 Page

483

---

## Page 484

describe the conclusion reached are the choice of the person

making the conclusion and may not necessarily be stated as

"identical" or "different." See my answer to interrogatory

1(a) •for a further discussion regarding the conclusions

reached concerning elemental analysis of bullet fragments.

Interrogatory No. 16:

Were any such stated conclusions

made with respect to the items of

evidence tested by spectrographic or neutron activation

analysis in this case?

Answer No. 16:

Consistent with my answer to inter-

rogatory 15 the answer is yes.

Interrogatory No. 17:

Were full and complete results of

the spectrographic and neutron acti-

vation tests given to the Warren Commission? Did the Warren

Commission ask for them?

Answer No. 17:

In interrogatory 14 I defined

"results" as the numerical quantitative

amount of a chemical element measured in the material examined.

This definition applied to NAA examinations. An extension of

this definition for spectrographic "results" would be the

relative concentration of a chemical element in the material

examined.

Using these definitions, the "results of the spec-

trographic

and

neutron activation tests" were not given to the

Warren

Commission.

Based on my review of the records, I

am

unable to determine if the Warren Comnission asked for them.

Interrogatory No. 18:

Were full and complete stated conclu-

sions as to what the tests showed given

to the Warren Commission? Did the warren Commission ask for

them?

Answer No. 18:

If by "full and complete stated conclu-

sions as to what the tests showed" the

plaintiff means our expert opinion as to what the results of the

spectrographic examinations and NAA indicated, the answer is yes.

Based on my review of the records, I am unable to determine if

the warren Commission asked for them.

Answer No. 19:

Interrogatory No. 20:

No.

If the answer to interrogatory number

12 is-affirmative, what are the other

items of evidence which were subjected to neutron activation

testing?

Answer No. 20:

-

Assuming plaintiff means to refer

to

"interrogatory 19," no answer is

necessary.

" Interrogatory No. 21:

If the answer to interrogatory number

12 (sic) is negative, why were the

following items of evidence not subjected to neutron activation

testing:

(a) CE 141, the live round found in the Mannlicher-Carcano

rifle which

allegedly belonged to Lee Harvey Oswald and

fired

- the shots which killed President Kennedy?

(b).

the clothing of President Kennedy and Governor "Connally

struck by or alleged to have been struck by bullets?

(c)

the curbstone on the south side of S. Main Street east

of the Triple Underpass which was struck by bullet?

(d)

the bullet fragment which is FBI Laboratory Number 03?

Answer No. 21:

(a)

Our records do not indicate why CE 141 (08) was not

examined by NAA.

16) Based on my experience and expertise, the reason the

clothing of President Kennedy and Governor Connally was not

examined by NAA in the areas where a bullet allegedly passed is

because NAA is not the method of choice for the determination

- 12 -

NW 54999 DocId:32989522 Page 485

## Page 486

of bullet holes. In 1963, emission spectroscopy was the

method

of choice for elemental analysis of the borders of

• holes in

garments.

• (c).

Based on my experience and expertise and an

examination.of

the notes made regarding the spectrographic

analysis of the lead

smear on the curbstone, it is clear that

the minimal amount of lead

smear present on the curbstone was

not adequate to conduct an examination by NAA.

(d)

Records indicate that è3 is a section of bullet

jacket devoid of its lead core.

Bullet jacket material made

of copper, zinc and/or iron is generally unsuitable for

examination by NAA unless chemical separations are conducted.

The chemical separations would necessarily destroy markings on

the item of evidence. Emission spectrographic analysis was the

method of choice for analysis of bullet jacket material in 1963.

Interrogatory No. 22:

Under normal procedures would the

results of the spectrographic or neutron

activation analyses be recorded and verified by someone other than

the person conducting the tests? Was such a procedure followed

with respect to the items of evidence tested by these techniques

'in connection with the investigation into President Kennedy's

assassination?.

Answer No. 22:

An examiner often consults with another

-

examiner concerning his findings in a

specific case, but in all likelihood there would be no reason

to commit this consultation to record.

An examination of records

does not indicate that more than one person recorded or verified

the results of the individual spectrographic or NAA examinations.

Interrogatory No. 23:

Was a full and complete comparison

made

between the chemical composition of

CE 399, the bullet which allegedly wounded

both President

Kennedy

and Governor Connally and (a) the composition of the

metallic traces on President Kennedy's clothing, (b) the com-

position of the metallic traces on Governor Connally's clothing,

and (c) the composition of all fragments removed from Governor

Conally's body?

Answer No. 23:

(a)

No. Referring to my answer to interrogatory

1(b),

a "full and

complete comparison" between the composition of

a bullet and

the minute traces of metal left at the edges of

a hole will not permit the conclusion that

the hole was made

by a specific bullet.

There were no metallic traces on Governor Connally's

clothing.

(c)

Our records indicate that only one fragment of lead

was removed from Governor Connally's body. The answer to this

portion of the interrogatory is yes.

Interrogatory No. 24: Was a full and complete comparison made

between the chemical composition of the

bullet fragments recovered from President Kennedy's head and (a)

the composition of the

sweepings from the windshield, and (b)

all five fragments found in the car during two different

searches?

Answer No. 24:

(a)

Yes, to the extent that the specimens were of adequate

size and condition for compositional analysis.

(b) Our records indicate that the metal fragments recovered

from President. Kennedy's head were lead and that the five frag-

ments found in the car consisted of a portion of-a jacketed bullet

(core and" jacket), a bullet jacket and three lead fragments.

It

is apparent from these records that a compositional comparison

was made where appropriate.

Interrogatory No. 25:

Was a full and complete comparison

made between the chemical composition

of CE 399, the bullet which allegedly wounded both

President

Kennedy and Governor Connally and (a)

the composition of

CF. 141,

the bullet found in the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, and.

(b)

all

other bullet fragments?

Answer No. 25:

(a) No.

Defendants.

OCT -. 5 1977,

MEMORANDUM OPINION

'AMES F. DAVEY, Clert

This matter is before the Court

on defendants' motion for summary

judgment. Plaintiff has brought suit under the Freedom of Information Act

("FOIA") to obtain materials relating to scientific and ballistics tests

alleged to have been performed on items of evidence in the assassination of

President John F. Kennedy. 5 U.S.C. $ 552(b) (7) (Supp. V 1975). The

defendants are the United States Department of Justice, to which plaintiff

has directed his requests for laboratory records of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation, and the United States Energy Research and Development Adminis-

tration ("'ERDA"), to which plaintiff has directed requests for records of

the Atomic Energy Commission ("AEC"), ERDA's predecessor agency.

ERDA's responses to plaintiff's interrogatories indicate that the

AEC's role in the investigation of the assassination of President

Kennedy was limited to making its reactor facilities at Oak

Tennessee, available for FBI tests on assassination

evidence.

See generally Defendant ERDA's Responses to

Plaintiff's First Set of Interrogatories.

Plaintiff apparently

does not dispute this po t; the only respect in which either

ERDA Or AEC figure in his recent submissions relates to the

FBI's alleged failure to follow up on an AEC official's recom-

mendations that certain tests be conducted.

See Affidavit of

Harold Weisberg, at 16; Letter from Dr. Paul C. Aebersold,

Director, Division of Isotopes Development, United States Atomic

Energy Commission, to Herbert J. Miller,

Assistant Attorney General,

Criminal Division, United States Department of Justice (December I1,

The AEC recommendations were conveyed to the FBI by

for the President's Commission on the Assassination of President

Kennedy (Warren Commission).

Letter from J. Lee Rankin, General Counsel,

President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy,

to J. Edgar Hoover, Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation,

(January 7, 1964).

In its reply, the FBI pointed out that it was

"well-acquainted" with the techniques propounded by the AEC,

and that arrangements

for such testing already were under way.

Edgar Hoover to J. Lee Rankin (January 10, 1964).

There is no indication that the FBI followed the AEC recommendations

the letter; indeed, the FBI special agent who conducted the type

of testing in question appears to have resented the AEC recommendation

as interfering

in the FBI's investigation. See Deposition of John F.

Although the Government's submissions to the plaintiff have been

voluminous, plaintiff maintains that much of what he has received was

unsought,

and

that

much

what he has sought has not been tendered to him.

The Government's position, on the other hand, remains, first, that it has

complied fully with plaintiff's requests'as

to materials extant, and second,

that it cannot possibly comply with the remaining requests because the •

materials

sought do not exist.

In moving for summary judgment,

the Government bears the burden

of demonstrating that no genuine issue of material fact impedes its right

to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Bloomgarden v. Coyer,

156 U.S. App. D.C. 109, 479 F.2d 201, 208 (D.C. Cir. 1973): Although mere

assertions in the pleadings will not

suffice to defeat a motion for summary

judgment, Dewey v. Clark, 86 U.S. App. D.C. 137, 180 F.2d 766, 770 (D.C.

Cir. 1950), matters of fact are to be viewed in the light most favorable to

the party opposing the motion. Nyhus v. Travel Management Corp.:

151 U.s.

App. D.C. 269, 466 F. 2d 440, 442 (D.C. Cir. 1972) ; Semaan v. Mumford, 118

U.S. App. D.C. 282, 335 F.2d 704, 705 п.2 (D.С. Cir. 1964).

I. BACKGROUND OF THE ACTION.

Plaintiff's initial quest for scientific investigatory data related

to the assassination of President Kennedy was frustrated in the courts on

the ground that the data sought lay within the purview of FOIA exemption

seven, covering

investigative matter. Weisberg v. United States Department

of Justice, 160 U.S. App. D.C. 71, 489 F.2d 1195 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (en banc),

cert. denied, 416

U.S. 993 (1974); see Act of June 5, 1967, Pub. L. No.

90-23, § 1, 81 Stat. 54 (current version at 5 U.S.C. $ 552(b) (7) (Supp. V

1975)). Congress subsequently narrowed

the scope of exemption seven, and

plaintiff renewed his requests. Act of Nov. 21, 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-502,

§ 2, 88 Stat. 1563, amending 5 U.S.C. $ 552(b) (7) (1970). On July 15, 1975,

this Court dismissed the action as moot, and plaintiff took an appeal. A

panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia

NW 54999 Dogid: 32989522 Page 500

---

## Page 501

-3-

Circuit reversed, and remanded for further proceedings. Weisberg v. United

States Department of Justice, 177 U.S. App. D.C. 161, 543 F. 2d 308 (D.C.

Cir. 1976). The Court of Appeals identified five categories

of investiga

tive

tests

as

to which

plaintiff had

made demands "which

raise material

factual questions

still in dispute." Id. at 163, 543 I.2d at 310. As the

Court of Appeals noted, however, there remain other categories of

tests;

such as the microscopic examinations performed on certain items of evidence,

as to which plaintiff

asserts his requests have not evoked

satisfactory

response. Id. at 164, 543

F.2d at 311.

These categories, as well as the

five enumerated in the Court of Appeals opinion, must figure in considera-

tion of the motion for summary judgment. In addition to identifying several

of the factual areas to be explored on remand, the Court of Appeals specified

an exploratory technique,

namely the taking of the testimony, by deposition

or otherwise, with an opportunity for cross-examination in any case, of the

individuals who actually conducted the tests, the results of which plaintiff

• has requested. Id. at 163, 164, 543 F.2d at 310, 311.

In February and March, 1977, plaintiff took the depositions of

four former and present employees of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

laboratory, all of whom worked directly with evidence associated with the

assassination.

The four are Robert A. Frazier, employed

as a special agent

in the laboratory's firearms and toolmarks unit during the investigation of

the assassination, and retired from the FBI as of April 1975; John F.

Gallagher, assigned to the laboratory's spectrographic unit during the

investigation, and retired as of January 1975; Lyndal I. Shaneyfelt,

assigned

a documents

examiner

and photographic specialist for the

laboratory between 1955 and 1975, when he retired from the Bureau; and

Cortlandt Cunningham, formerly a special agent supervisor in the firearms.

and toolmarks unit during the investigation, and presently chief of the

unit.

Frazier and Cunningham were deposed

February 24, 1977, and Gallagher

and Shaneyfelt were deposed March 28, 1977. At each deposition save that

of former Special Agent Gallagher, examination was by plaintiff's counsel

NW 54999

DorId: 32989522 Page

## Page 502

only, with occasionally interposed objections from counsel for

the

defendants.

At a hearing March 30, 1977, counsel for plaintiff indicated

that no further depositions of FBI employees who had participated in the

Bureau's investigation were planned.

Weisberg v. United States Department

of Justice, No. 75-226, II. at 4 (D.D.C.. March 30, 1977). These representa-

tions controvert the suggestion

in

1 an

affidavit of

the plaintiff that

"[t]his Court refused me the depositions my counsel and I consider

necessary

to meet what I regard as the mandate of the court of appeals..."

Affidavit of Harold Weisberg I 165, at 34 (July 28, 1977) [hereinafter

"Weisberg Affidavit"']. Read broadly, the mandate of the Court of Appeals

was to resolve whether the data sought exist on "the basis of the best

available evidence, i.e., the witnesses who had personal knowledge of

events at the time the investigation was made." 177 U.S. App. D.C. at 164,

543 F.2d at 311. Plaintiff has not sought to depose any

such witness

other

than the four whose depositions were taken. To borrow the metaphor employed

by the Court of Appeals in its opinion above, the legal engine of

crosS-

examination has done its work on plaintiff's behalf with respect to witnesses

with direct knowledge of the FBI investigation into the President's assassí-

nation. 177 U.S. App. D.C. at 164, 543 F.2d at

311. The issue devolves

to what the evidence adduced in the four depositions establishes, and thence

to whether there now remains a genuine issue as to whether

the Government

has complied with the strictures of the FOIA.

II. THE EVIDENCE ADDUCED.

The testimony of & . four deponents related not only to specific

pieces of assassination evidence and the tests performed, or not performed,

upon them, but also to the procedures,

and occasionally lack of procedures,

employed in those sections of the FBI laboratory with which

the deponents

2/ Counsel had previously indicated he planned to depose plaintiff,

an employee of the National Archives, which has custody of the

evidence Involved, and an FBI special agent who had not parti-

cipated in the investigation but whose affidavit had constituted

part of the Government's response to plaintiff's request.

NW 54999 Dodtd: 32989522 Page 502

## Page 503

-5-

were familiar. These laboratory procedures bear significantly on the

question

whether much of the material plaintiff seeks exists.

Laboratory Procedures. The laboratory's Scientific Analysis

Section, was known at the time of the investigation as the Physics and

Chemistry Section; then,

as

now, the section comprised

several disparate

units, including the firearms and toolmarks unit, and the spectrographic

unit, which in 1963-64 was responsible for both emissions spectrography

and neutron activation analysis. Cunningham Deposition, at 4-5. During

the investigation of the Presidential assassination, investigating agencies

in the field--the Dallas Police Department, the Secret Service, and the

FBI--forwarded the evidence to the FBI laboratory, in some instances directly

to the firearms and toolmarks unit. Frazier Deposition, at 5, 7-8;

Cunningham Deposition, at

8. Ordinarily, the evidence would be accompanied

by a statement of the matters sought to be ascertained through laboratory

testing, as, for example, the presence of gunpowder on a piece of evidence.

Frazier Deposition, at 6, 8. The decision as to the specific tests to be

conducted, however, was made within the laboratory. Id. at 8-9; Cunningham

Deposition, at 8-9; Gallagher Deposition, at 26-27. The decisionmaking

process as to which tests would be appropriate apparently was highly

informal:

in some cases, Frazier,, the laboratory examiner with direct

responsibility for the Physics and Chemistry Section's efforts in the

investigation, conferred with his superiors on the tests to be performed,

Cunningham Deposition, at 8-9, and in others, he and the individual

examiners who would conduct le tests conferred on which tests to perform.

Frazier Deposition, at 8; Gallagher Deposition,

at 27. In still other

instances, if the individual examiner determined

that tests outside his

domain were called for, he and his supervisor (Frazier, in most cases)

would approach examiners in the other units with jurisdiction over the

requisite type of testing.

Cunningham Deposition, at 10; Frazier Deposition,

at 8-9; Shaneyfelt Deposition, at 14. Only rarely were these

conferences

on tests to be performed recorded in communications between the conferees,

NW 54999 Dogfd: 32989522 Page 503

---

## Page 504

MESSELS

-6-

or in notes made by one of them. Cunningham Deposition, at 10; Frazier

Deposition, at

8-9; Gallagher Deposition, at 27-28.

The tests determined to be appropriate for a given item of

physical evidence typically were conducted by examiners working individually,

or under the direct

supervision of the individual examiner. Cunninghan

Deposition, at 10; Frazier Deposition, at 10. Three examiners in the

firearms and toolmarks unit collaborated on the testing within that unit,

all three having been present during all tests conducted by the unit on

assassination evidence, save a velocity test.

Cunningham Deposition, at 53.

Several examiners

tested items of evidence in the spectrography unit,

although they appear to have worked separately. Gallagher Deposition, at

7, 35-37.

Just as there was no established procedure for deciding which

tests were to be performed

on a particular item of evidence, there was no

requirement that test results be expressed in a particular format, or

expressed at all if the results were insignificant. In most instances, the

examiner performing a test took notes during the testing. Cunningham

Deposition, at 11; Frazier Deposition, at 10; Gallagher Deposition, at 38.

However, all deponents testified to not having made notes on results they

deemed insignificant or insufficiently reliable. Cunningham, for example,

testified to his practice of making notes on

a weapon's operating condition

only if the weapon was not in normal working

order. Cunningham Deposition,

at 21. Gallagher explained the absence of

observation data in a neutron

activation analysis folder by suggesting that he might have skipped the

step of noting down the readings and done the tabulations in his head.

Gallagher Deposition, at 61-62. He indicated

later that he did not report

a thirty percent variation in primer residue data between shells because

he did not consider the variation significant. Id. at 114. Shaneyfelt

testified that he had not submitted a report on the four frames allegedly

spliced out

of the Zapruder film of the assassination because the film prínt

from which he had worked

was complete.

Shaneyfelt Deposition, at 21.

What an examiner did with test results likewise varied.

In many

instances, the examiner dictated

a report

the

tests

conducted, either

for use on its own or for incorporation in

a more

comprehensive report

prepared by the examiner's superior. Frazier Deposition, at 11; Gallagher

Deposition, At 38. Gallagher, however, indicated

that he occasionally

submitted

data directly to Special Agent Frazier who transmuted

the figures

into prose. • Gallagher Deposition, at 38. When the examiner himself pre-

pared the report, he did not always include in it all the results obtained,

as when the testing was done for "background purposes," Gallagher Deposi-

tion, at 57; when flaws in the testing itself cast the results in doubt,

see id. at 71, or when the results would

simply not be of value, in the

examiner's judgment. Cunningham Deposition, at 47. In some instances,

the examiner's failure to make a report is unexplained. See Cunningham

Deposition, at 33, 53; Gallagher Deposition,

at 73-74.

After the report was prepared, one copy went into FBI files,

another went to the "original contributor" of the item of evidence on which

the report was based (generally the FBI's Dallas field office), and a third

went to the examiner or examiners responsible, for them

to retain informally

with their notes of the tests. Cunningham Deposition, at 11-12, 17;

Frazier Deposition, at 12, 15; Gallagher Depositión;:; at 86-87. Whether

the Warren Commission received the actual reports, and how the reports the

Commission received were transmitted, varied widely. Former Special Agent

Frazier recalled the "mechana, s"

of

the

process as being, first, that the

laboratory forwarded the report to the Dallas field office; next, that the

Dallas office incorporated the report into its report to the Commission,

and finally, that the latter report was

transmitted to

the Commission.

Frazier Deposition, at 19-20. In practice, however,

there appears to have

been substantial, continuing and direct contact between laboratory personnel

and the Commission. Cunningham Deposition, at 49-50; Irazier Deposition,

at 20-21; Shaneyfelt Deposition, at 8. Frazier indicated that several

laboratory employees, whose identities he could not recall, served as

Ilaison between the laboratory and the Commission.

Frazier Deposition, at

20. Cunningham stated

that he "generated some correspondence" with the

Commission every day during the laboratory's participation in the investi-

gation. Cunningham Deposition, at 51.

Shaneyfelt indicated

that his reports

went to the Commission via his section chief, and that he testified to the

Commission, either live or by deposition, on all examinations he conducted.

Shaneyfelt Deposition, at 8-9. In his affidavit of May 13, 1965, John W.

Kilty, special agent assigned to the FBI laboratory in a supervisory capacity,

• stated that plaintiff had been told that all final FBI laboratory reports .

In the pertinent categories of testing had been furnished to the Commission.

However, there apparently was no monitoring system known to deponents to

log the transfer of final reports to the Commission, and no custodian within

the laboratory to collect final laboratory reports. Frazier Deposition,

at 68. It is clear, on the other hand, that not all examiners' observation

notes went to the Commission, the rule being that examiners retained their

notes; except when the supervisor prepared

a report directly from the notes.

Cunningham Deposition, at 47, 52-53; Frazier Deposition, at 15; see

Gallagher Deposition, at 73, 107. One instance of the latter occurred when

Frazier used Gallagher's worksheets to prepare a report on testing of a

bullet fragment; both the worksheets

and

the report went to the Commission,

though only Frazier appeared

before the Commission. Frazier Deposition,

at 42-44; Gallagher Deposition, at 82, 84. Finally, neither observation

notes, worksheets, nor final reports were distributed among units within

the laboratory, absent a specific reason. Cunningham Deposition, at 12-13;

Frazier Deposition, at 15, 18. Former Special Agent Gallagher testified

that even within the spectrographic unit one examiner's report on testing

would not necessarily, or even customarily, have been circulated

among the

other

examiners in the same unit. Gallagher Deposition, at 7-8. An

examiner who performed tests on a particular item of evidence thus might

be unaware whether other units within the laboratory had performed other

tests on the same item.

E.g. Cunningham Deposition, at 22-23; Gallagher

Deposition, at 6-7, 26; Shaneyfelt Deposition, at 16.

Tests Performed on Assassination Evidence. The Court of Appeals

opinion remanding this case for further consideration and testimony adverts

to five areas

of

continuing factual dispute 1177 U.S. App. D.C. at 163-64,

543 F.2d

at 310-11]:

(1) Fingi reports

of spectrographic -analyses;

(2) Reports on neutron activation analyses of bullet fragments;

(3) Raw data of spectrographic and neutron activation analysis

tests;

(4) Neutron activation analysis of clothing; and

31

(5) Emissions spectroscopy data and reports.

Plaintiff's opposition to the motion for summary judgment identi-

fies nine specific areas of testing,

encompassed within the five areas

enumerated by the Court of Appeals, in which plaintiff asserts the evidence

shows tests should have been, or were, conducted, yet concerning which

plaintiff has received no mat-rials. These areas are:

(1) Neutron activation analysis of clothing, Opp., at 7-8;

(2) Neutron activation analysis

of windshield scrapings, Opp.,

at 8-9;

(3) Neutron activation analysis of 03, a bullet fragment dis-

covered beside the right front seat of the Presidential

limousine, Opp., at 9;

(4) Print-outs for neutron activation analysis of Q3 and other

specimens, Oppo, at 9;

(5) Testing of the live round found chambered in the

Mannlicher-Carcano rifle determined to have been the

murder weapon, and comparison of said live round with

shells found at the scene, Opp., at 9-10:;

The distinction between spectroscopic analysis and

spectrographic analysis was not observed in deposition

testimony and the pleadings. Hence, discussion of

spectrography herein should be deemed to encompass

spectroscopy where appropriate.

(6) Spectrographic testing of the curbstone supposed to have

been struck by a bullet, a bullet fragment or fragments,

or other airborne debris during the moments of the

assassination, Opp., at 10;

(7) Testing of the bullet holes below the collar button of

the shirt President Kennedy was wearing when he was

shot, Opp., at 10;

(8) A "formal report" prepared by Frazier on the basis of

Gallagher's comparison of windshield scrapings with

other bullet matter, and alluded to in an exchange

between Commission counsel and Frazier during Frazier's

testimony before

the Commission, Opp., at 10-11; and

(9) Report on neutron activation testing, Opp.,

at 11.

As these differently organized catalogs of potential factual

Issues indicate, there are numerous ways of approaching

the factual aspects

of this case for the purpose of determining whether they engender issues

of sufficient magnitude to defeat the motion for summary judgment. What

follows is an amalgam or combination of the Court of Appeals' and plaintiff's

approaches, in that this discussion commences with general observations on

firearms testing, spectrography, and

neutron

activation analysis, with

particular emphasis on each technique's capabilities and limitations, and

proceeds to consideration of testing on specific items of evidence. It

should be stressed that the question throughout is not whether tests ought

to have been made, or

even whether tests that actually were made should have

culminated in the preparation of reports, but simply whether there is any

genuine issue as

to the existence of the reports and other materials

plaintiff Weisberg seeks.

Firearms Identification. Special Agent Cunningham's work with

the firearms and toolmarks unit of the laboratory's Scientific Analysis

Section has included

the examination of firearms and bullets to determine

the source of

particular bullets. Cunningham testified that the process

commences with the marking, weighing, and identification of the slug as

to type and characteristics. Cunningham Deposition, at 18-19. The bullet

is examined

microscopically for rifling marks that might be useful for

purposes of

identifying the source of the bullet. Id. at 19-20. If a

weapon believed to be the source of the bullet is on hand, as was the

Mannlicher-Carcano rifle in

the Presidential assassination, it, too, is

examined. Id. at 20-22. The examiner then fires the weapon using ammunition

as similar as possible to the bullet under analysis. Id. at 25. The

"evidence bullet" and the test bullet then are viewed simultaneously under

a comparison microscope. Id. Any of three conclusions is possible:

identification, indicating that the bullet under study was fired from the

weapon in question, and no other; non-identification, indicating that the

general rifling characteristics of the two bullets vary to the degree suf-

ficient to exclude the weapon as the source of the bullet under analysis;

and "no conclusion," indicating

that the general characteristics are

similar, but that the individual markings are either different or lacking.

Id. at 26-27.

both

Spectrography. Former Special Agent Gallagher was a specialist in

spectrographic examination and neutron activation analysis. In

spectrographic analysis, samples are either sparked or burned; the results

show up on spectrographic plates from which the examiner derives composition

data. Gallagher Deposition, at 37-38. Spectrographic examination will

elicit information on

a range of elements, though specific readings in

multiple tests of the same item of evidence may vary as a consequence of

the technique's relative insensitivity, inherent testing error, and

compositional differences between different portions of the object under

analysis.

Id. at 41-42, 54, 58-60. Although less sensitive than neutron

NW 54999

DodId: 32989522 Page 509

## Page 510

-12-

activation analysis, spectrographic testing appears

to have been much more

abundantly used in the

examination of

evidence,

apparently because of the

limitations inherent in neutron activation analysis.

Neutron Activation Analysis. In 1964, during the neutron acti-.

vation analysis conducted in connection with

the investigation into the

assassination

of President Kennedy, neutron

activation

analysis

was

rela

tively in an infant state, particularly so far

the equipment

was

con-

cerned.. Id. at 115. Even so, it was a far more sensitive technique for

measuring the presence

of certain elements in samples than spectrography:

it was about twice as

sensitive with respect to antimony, barium and other

elements present in items of the assassination evidence, and up to a

thousand times as sensitive with respect to other elements. Id. at 116.

Its limitations, however, precluded its use on many items of assassination

evidence, and vitiated the results of some

tests that were performed

on

items. Id. at 50-51, 92.

One such limitation was that only a handful of

elements were discernible through neutron activation analysis. Id. at 42.

Another was that certain elements, such as sodium and copper, showed up so

prominently in neutron activation analysis results

to obscure others.

Id. at 51, 74. Thus, items of

evidence composed largely of copper, such

as copper bullet jackets, were not subjected to neutron activation analysis.

Id. at 74-75, 97, 98-99. By the same token, however, lead does not show

up in neutron activation analysis. Id. at 109.

On behalf of the FBI laboratory, Gallagher conducted neutron

activation analysis on items of assassination evidence at the reactor at

Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. Gallagher Deposition, at 64.

The paraffin lifts taken from Lee Harvey Oswald

were tested shortly after

the assassination, but other items were not tested at Oak Ridge until

May 1964. Id. at 63, 65. When plaintiff's counsel asked him to explain

the delay with respect to other items, Gallagher pointed out that the FBI's

access to the reactor was limited, and that the paraffin lifts were tested

NW 54999 Dogid: 32989522 Page 510

## Page 511

-13-

early because they were

tested solely by neutron activitation analysis,

whereas

bullet

samples

could

be tested by spectrography as well. Id. at

65.

Two additional observations on both spectrographic examination

and neutron

activation analysis should be made in response to points raised

In plaintiff Weisberg's

affidavit. First, plaintiff asserts that none of

the reports he has been furnished alludes to microscopic examination,

which both Cunningham and Gallagher testified they frequently conducted.

Weisberg Affidavit, at 32; Cunningham Deposition, 18-19; Gallagher Depo-

sition, at 31. Gallagher's explanation

was that

microscopic examination,

at least within the FBI laboratory, is

so widely accepted as a preliminary

to spectrographic and other tests as not to be worth noting in a report.

Gallagher Deposition, at 107. That, in plaintiff's words, "there is not

a word in a single report" about microscopic examination is entirely

consistent with Gallagher's statement that FBI laboratory practice was to

omit reference to microscopic examination. The second point raised by

plaintiff is that the FBI laboratory reports contain "no statement of

positive proof in the

comparisons" of different items of evidence; "[t]here

is only the meaningless description of 'similar.'"

Weisberg Affidavit,

at 8. Here, too, the deposition testimony reveals the plaintiff to be

under a misapprehension, stemming from ignorance not of FBI laboratory

practice in this instance, b

of the inherent limitations of FBI examina-

tion techniques.

Even neutron

activation analysis,

a much more sophisticated

technique than spectrography, frequently will not enable bullet fragments,

for example, to be positively identified as having come from a particular

bullet. Cunningham Deposition, at 45-48; Gallagher Deposition, at 97-98.

Neither will it be possible in many

instances

to exclude a fragment

as having

come from a given bullet, as when compositional variances are not suffi-

ciently great to indicate different sources rather than fluctuations in

composition within the bullet. Gallagher Deposition, at 102-05.

CE # 399: The "Pristine Bullet." The Warren Commission con-

cluded that Commission Exhibit 399, one of the bullets fired at the

Presidential motorcade that day, had passed through the President's neck,

and struck successively Governor Connally's chest, wrist, and thigh,

ending its jäurney without

substantial visible damage to itself.

Plaintiff's counsel directed numerous questions to both Cunningham and

Frazier on how the slug could have inflicted

so much damage without itself

sustaining damage. Cunningham Deposition, at 34-37; Frazier Deposition,.

at 24-28, 31-33. Although plaintiff's line of questioning is, at best,

doubtfully relevant to the question whether plaintiff has received all

material on CE

399, plaintiff has devoted considerable discussion to the

physical state

of CE 399. Weisberg Affidavit, at 44-48. Cunningham was

asked

whether he would

expect a bullet alleged to have inflicted

the damage

attributed to CE 399 to emerge as unscathed as CE 399. Cunningham Deposi-

tion,. at 35. Cunningham pointed out that a relatively heavy bullet with a

slow muzzle velocity normally is less likely to fragment upon impact than

lighter, faster

slugs, and

that

the damage imputed to CE 399 and its out-

wardly pristine condition were not inconsistent. Id. at 36-37. Frazier,

who with Cunningham and one other had performed the ballistics tests on

assassination evidence, observed that CE 399 had flattened slightly during

its

journey and might have extruded a significant amount of lead, in the

form of fragments, from its base. Frazier Deposition, at 26-27, 32, 38-39.

The remainder of plaintiff's assertions regarding CE 399 concern

tests he claims ought to have been performed, such as

comparison of CE 399

with core fragments.

Weisberg Affidavit, at 15, 16. Gallagher indicated

that he indeed had made such comparisons, but that aside from the spectro-

graphic worksheets which formed the basis of Frazier's November 23, 1963

report, he prepared no reports on the comparison under spectrography or

neutron activation analysis.

Gallagher Deposition, at 26, 73-74.

Gallagher indicated also that a directive to preserve CE 399 "for posterity"

precluded his testing different portions of the bullet for composition,

NW 54999

DodId: 32989522 Page 512

---

## Page 513

-15-

id. at 57, though he ran multiple tests on the samples he was permitted to

remove. Id. at 59-60. Apart from plaintiff's allegations, there is

nothing to

suggest that any comparative test reports, by spectrographic

and neutron activation techniques, were prepared other than those furnished

to plaintife!

That such tests should have been made is not relevant, even

if true.

The first report disseminated by the FBI laboratory took the form

•of a letter dated November 23, 1963, to Dallas Police Chief Jesse Curry.

Gallagher Exh. 5. Portions of this letter indicate that CE 399 [referred

to in the letter

as Q1] was fred from the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, and

that the windshield

scrapings as well

as certain bullet fragments were

determined to be similar in composition to CE 399. Gallagher Exh. 5, at 2.

In the course of his testimony before the Commission, Frazier was questioned

about a "comparison made of the. lead residues

on the inside of the wird:-

shield with . . . the bullet fragments. . ."

Frazier indicated

he had

prepared "the formal report of the entire examination" based on the report

Gallagher had submitted. Plaintiff claims not to have received either the

"formal report" or the "report" prepared by Gallagher. Opposition, at 11.

The confusion as to the latter appears to have stemmed

from differences in

terminology: what Frazier called a report consisted of Gallagher's work-

sheets. Gallagher Deposition, at 84. As to the "formal report," plaintiff

argues that the November 23 letter could not possibly cover "the entire

examination" because much testing, particularly the neutron activation

analysis, did not transpire until months after the letter was written.

Opposition, at 1l. Frazier and Gallagher, on the other hand, indicate

that the November 23 letter was the "formal report" Frazier alluded to in

his Commission testimony. Frazier Deposition, at 41; Gallagher Deposition,

at 86. Here, too, the evidence is uniformly against plaintiff's assertion.

Frazier's reference to "the formal report of the entire examination" plainly

relates to the procedures about which he was just queried:

the comparison

NW 54999 DolId: 32989522 Page 513

## Page 514

ПІТНЯТТЬ ТИТАНИ

-16-

of the windshield residues with CE 399 and bullet fragments.

Plaintiff's

assumption that the "formal report" covers the entire investigation rather

than one of the numerous

examinations which comprised the investigation is

wholly unwarranted.

There is no evidence to controvert Frazier's and

Gallagher's Statements that the November

23 letter was, in fact, the

"formal report" described by Frazier before the Commission.

Plaintiff also contends that neither

CE 399 nor any bullet

fragment was tested for human residue. Weisberg Affidavit, at 14. Because

this allegation does not concern the existence of unfurnished reports but

rather the appropriateness of such tests, such

contention need not be con

sidered except to note that the depositions yield no indication that such

testing ever occurred. Cunningham Deposition, at 22-23; Gallagher Depo-

sition, at 39, 48.

Plaintiff asserts he received no report on "the analysis of the

copper-jacket material." Weisberg Affidavit, at 15. Gallagher indicated

that laboratory practice was not to test copper jackets spectrographically

unless such testing would contribute to

the investigation. Gallagher

Deposition, at 13. Copper's tendency

to overshadow other

elements under

neutron activation analysis precluded testing of that kind. Id. at 74-75.

Nothing in the record indicates reports or other materials in this area

have not been furnished.

Q8: The Live Round. Plaintiff claims repeatedly not to have

received reports on Q8, the live round discovered in the chamber of the

Mannlicher-Carcano rifle. Opposition, at 10; Weisberg Affidavit, at 16,

57.

Gallagher was unaware whether the round had been tested, and indicated

that it probably should have been tested. Gallagher Deposition, at 43-46.

Defendant Department of Justice has indicated that Q8 was subjected to

"Firearms Identification" testing only. Defendant United States Department

of Justice's Answers to Plaintiff's First Set of Interrogatories, at 4.

Inexplicably, however, plaintiff directed questions about Q8 only to

NW 54999 DodId: 32989522 Page 514

---

## Page 515

-17-

Gallagher, who was unfamiliar with testing in the firearms identification

category, and not to Frazier or Cunningham, both of whom conducted firearms

identification tests. Though what either of the latter might have said

about Q8 is open to speculation, the November 23, 1963 report to Chief

Curry descrites Q8 only

as being of the same manufacture as certain

cartridges found

on the scene in the school book depository building.

The

inference to be drawn, uncontroverted by any other evidence, is that Q8 was

subjected to visual scrutiny only by one of the ballistics examiners, and

thus that no reports or other material on Q8 remain to be furnished.

It

is worth noting parenthetically that the plaintiff does not indicate, and

the Court does not discern, what purpose additional testing of Q8 would

have served. In that respect, Gallagher's supposition--that no further

testing of Q8 was necessary because it

was

sufficient that

the live round

was of the same manufacture as the cartridges--seems eminently reasonable.

Gallagher Deposition, at 46-47, 68-69.

There is no evidence to

suggest

that reports or other materials on Q8 have not been supplied.

Testing of Clothing. Taken together, the Weisberg

affidavit

and plaintiff's Opposition to the motion for summary judgment reveal only

one point of dispute: whether a report exists comparing the two anterior

holes in CE 394, the shirt worn by President Kennedy on November 22, 1963.

Opposition, at

10; Weisberg Affidavit, at 24-25. As to the remaining tests

performed on items of clothing (the President's, Governor Connally's, and

Oswald's), the record indicates that spectrographic testing only was per-

formed

on these items, and t

it neutron activation analysis was not performed

because

laboratory personnel did not deem it an appropriate

technique for

those items. Defendant United

States Department of Justice's Answers to

Plaintiff's First Set of Interrogatories, at 12-13; Gallagher Deposition,

at 50-52. The worksheets reflecting examination of both the President's

and Governor Connally's clothing have'been provided to plaintiff, together

with the FBI's reports, internal and external, on the examinations. E.g:

Letter from J. Edgar Hoover

to J. Lee Rankin (March 23, 1964); Memorandum

From R. H. Jevons to Mr. Conrad (April 15, 1964).

The sole basis for plaintiff's assertion that an extant report on

the comparison of CE 394 holes remains to be furnished is that former

Special Agent Frazier

testified in the course

of his deposition that he

had asked

another

examiner to determine, by buttoning

the shirt, whether

the two anterior holes overlap. Frazier Deposition, at 60-62. Initially,

Frazier could not recall whether he himself had conducted that aspect of the

examination of the shirt, id. at 61, and he

subsequently indicated that

another examiner, whom he thought was Paul M. Stombaugh, had made the

examination, and prepared a report on his conclusions. Id. at 62. Frazier

assumed that the Commission had obtained a copy of the report in the course

of taking Stombaugh's testimony. Id. There is no indication outside

Frazier's deposition testimony that Stombaugh, or any examiner other

than

Frazier, prepared such a report. CE 394 was discussed only twice in the

course of the Commission hearings, by Cmdr. James J. Humes, a pathologist

at the Naval Medical Center who testified on the autopsy conducted on the

5/

body of the President,

and by Frazier himself. Frazier stated

first that

he himself had

conducted the examination of the President's shirt.

V Hearings Before the President's Comm'n on the Assassination of President

Kennedy 60 (1964). He stated that "on the front of the shirt, I found what

amounts to one hole. Actually, it is a hole through both the button line

of the shirt and the buttonhole line which overlap down the front of the

shirt when it is buttoned." Id. Frazier's testimony before the Commission

compels the conclusion that he was mistaken in attributing responsibility

for the examination of the two anterior holes to another examiner. One

5/ Commander Humes indicated that "with the shirt buttoned, the

Ily front of the shirt causes two layers oi cloth to be

present in this location, and that Isic, there is a defect

in the inner layer of cloth and a corresponding defect in

the outer layer of the cloth."

II Hearings Before the

President's Comm'n on the Assassination of President

Kennedy 365 (1964).

He said also that "the defects in 393

[the President's suitcoat] and 394 [the shirt] coincide

virtually exactly with one another."

Id. at 366.

explanation for his error, aside from the lapse of more than thirteen

years

since the examination in question, is that Special Agent Stombaugh

indeed examined the fibers of a shirt linked with the assassination, and

testified before the Commission on the results of his examination; the

shirt in question, however, was CE 150, that worn by Lee Harvey Oswald at

the point he was captured

by police. IV Hearings, supra, at 74-75.

There being no genuine question as to the existence of the report alluded

to by Frazier in his deposition, this point, too, must be resolved against

the plaintiff.

Neutron Activation Testing of Fragments and Residue. Plaintiff

claims not to have received extant reports

on the neutron activation

analysis of Q3, a fragment recovered from beside the right front seat of

the Presidential limousine, and Q15, residues

obtained by scraping the

Inside of the limousine's windshield. Opposition, at

8-9; Weisberg

Affidavit, at 13. The Department of Justice answers to plaintiff's inter-

rogatories indicated that neither Q3 nor Q15 was subjected to neutron

activation analysis.

Defendant United States Department of Justice's

Answers to Plaintiff's First Set of Interrogatories, at 12, 13. When

former Special Agent Gallagher was queried about 03, he initially could not

recall testing it, but later, on his own initiative, he remembered sub-

jecting the item to neutron activation analysis and emerging with no

significant result.

Gallagher Deposition, at 74-75, 90-92. The lack of

results for Q3, a fragment consisting chiefly of copper jacket, is con-

sistent with Gallagher's previous statement that copper is normally not

susceptible to neutron activation analysis. Id. at 74. As to Q15, the

windshield scraping, Gallagher stated, after initial inability to recall,

that neutron activation analysis had, just as with Q3, not resulted in any

significant finding, chiefly because the Q15 sample was inadequate. Id.

at 71. In each case, Gallagher had left his worksheets virtually blank,

accounting for the Department's assumption

in its answers to

plaintiff's

interrogatories that no

neutron activation analysis

on these items had been

NW 54999 DodId: 32989522

-20-

conducted. The record indicates conclusively that, despite its denial

that such

testing had occurred, the Government has unwittingly supplied

the plaintiff with

the very worksheets

to indicate that

such

testing

; did

occur, albeit unsuccessfully. As to the printouts from the

testing,

Gallagher indicated that the data on the

printouts was duplicative of that

on the worksheets,

and hence that the printouts

themselves might not have

• been kept. Gallagher Deposition, at 92, 117. The deposition testimony

on the neutron activation analysis conducted

on fragments does not indi-

cate that tests were conducted for which materials have not been furnished.

Dealey Plaza Curbstone. Plaintiff claims that he was not supplied

with materials relating to testing performed on a curbstone removed in 1964

from near the site of the assassination. Opposition, at 10; Weisberg

Affidavit, at 10, 36-42.

According to bystanders at the assassination,

there were indications that a bullet or bullet fragment had struck the

curbstone during

the moments

of firing at the Presidential limousine.

On

July 7, 1964, the Warren Commission requested an examination of the curb-

stone, and early in August Special Agent Lyndal Shaneyfelt was dispatched

to Dallas to retrieve it.

The result of his analysis

of the "smear" he

discovered on the curbstone was

that the foreign

substances thereon "could

be bullet metal." Shaneyfelt Exh. 2. The tests conducted on the curbstone

were microscopic and spectrographic only; no neutron activation analysis

was conducted. Gallagher Deposition, at 69-70. The decision not to subject

It might be noted that plaintiff's allegations regarding

the curbstone extend far beyond testing materials

supposedly not furnished pursuant to his FOIA requests.

His submissions include the

affidavit of James T. Tague,

the assassination apparently struck by un-

identified debris associated, Tague contends, with the

mark on the curbstone.

Tague Affidavit, at 7. Much of

the affidavits of both plaintiff Weisberg and

Mr. Tague

are directed toward establishing that the mark on the

curbstone underwent drastic alteration, from a chip in

1963 to a smear in mid-1964, when the FBI recovered the

curbstone.

It is not clear from plaintiff's affidavit

whether he is

asserting that the FBI removed the wrong

curbstone, or that the curbstone is the same, with only

the mark different. Compare Weisberg Affidavit 4 185

with id. " 194.

In any case, none of the allegations on

these points needs be considered in the context of

plaintiff's FOIA requests, and the extent of Government

the mark to neutron activation analysis explains the disparity between the

two elements isolated in the "smear" and the nine isolated from bullet core

fragments, and

accounts also for the laboratory's reluctance to attribute

the mark to a bullet. See Weisberg Affidavit, l 33, at 10; Frazier Deposi-

tion, at 48; Shaneyfelt Exh. 2. As to microscopic examination, Frazier

testified on deposition that he had scrutinized the curbstone mark under

a microscope, and Shaneyfelt indicated that he might have done so in the

course of conducting other tests on the mark. Frazier Deposition, at 51;

Shaneyfelt Deposition, at 14. Frazier incorporated the results of his

microscopic examination of the curbstone into a draft of a letter eventually

sent August 12, 1964, by J. Edgar Hoover

to Commission counsel Rankin. The .

spectrographic examination of the curbstone was conducted by Special Agent

William R. Heilman, now retired. Memorandum from M. J. Stack, Jr. to Mr.

Cochran (June 20, 1975). The spectrographic plate which reflects the

single run to which Heilman subjected

the curbstone has not been furnished

to the plaintiff; Heilman believes it

was discarded in the course of one

of the laboratory's periodic housecleanings. Id. Shaneyfelt testified

to not having seen any other reports on

the curbstone besides those shown

to him in the course of his deposition.

Shaneyfelt Deposition, at 15.

Taken together, these aspects of the record indicate uniformly that all

available material on testing of the curbstone has been furnished to

plaintiff.

CONCLUSION

The foregoing analysis of the record has disposed of every con-

tention and claim the Court has been able to elicit from plaintiff's various

submissions. In many instances, there is direct testimony that a particular

test was not performed; in others, testimony as to

particular laboratory

practices compels the conclusion that the test was not performed. For all

its detail, the preceding analysis does not pretend to treat such aspects of

plaintiff's argument as the alleged destruction of assassination evidence

and falsification of test results. Neither topic is pertinent. The

analysis likewise has not dealt extensively with plaintiff's allegations

MW 54999 DobId: 32989522 Page 519

## Page 520

-22-

and suggestions, sounding of conspiracy, that reports and materials have been

stolen or deliberately mislaid, and that Government witnesses have lied under

oath;

apart from these allegations, there is not an iota of evidence to

support either assertion.

A FOIA action demonstrably lacking in genuine issues of material

fact is appropriately resolved by summary judgment. See Nolen v. Rumsfeld,

535 F.2d 890, 891 (5th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1104 (1977). This

action lacks

such issues. Although plaintiff has impugned defendants'

affidavits on the ground that they do not specify the files searched in

compliance with plaintiff's request, Opposition, at 12, the Government's

response to

a FOIA request need not be as specific as plaintiff would require,

it being sufficient that the affiant has personal knowledge that all files

which might contain requested material have been searched. Exxon Corp. v.

FTC, 384 F. Supp. 755, 759-61 (D.D.C. 1974), remanded without opinion, 527

F.2d 1386 (D.C. Cir. 1976).

As in Nolen, supra, "[the Government has, in candor and good faith

before this Court, stated that all the records available have been made

available to the plaintiff." 535 F.2d at 891. If plaintiff has any further

recourse, it is not under FOIA. See id. Accordingly, defendants' motion

for summary judgment must be granted.

An Order consistent with the foregoing has been entered this

4

day of October, 1977.

FREEDOM DE INFORMATION

ACI, TINUS 5, I. S. C., SECTION 552

The Bouse overIode the President's veto of this

legislation (copy attached) by a vote of 371 to 31 on 11-20-74,

and the Senate by a vote of 65 to 27 on 11-21-74. It is to

become effective 90 days after enactuent or on February 19, 1975.

PrioI memoranda have been sent through at various stages of

captioned legislation reporting results of conferences held

betwees Bareau officials and representatives os the Department,

Congressional staffs and White: House officials. The purpose

of this memorandun therefore, is to point out those provisions

of these amenöments which it is believed will have the greatest

impact on the FBI. For the purpose of clarity, the areas have

been broken dos into the following categories:

(1) processing

of requests; (2) increase in number of files involved; (3)

increase in number of people who can now request data; and (4)

in-camera inspection of classified documents.

PROCESSING OF REQUESTS

By say of background, it will be recalled that

"investigatory files conpiled for law enforcement purposes*

were exempt fron disclosure under the provisions of the

Freedon of Information Act (FOIA) - Then in July of 1973,

Dapartmental Dider 523-73 was issued by then Attorney

General Elliot I. Richardson. By this order ve were instructed

to make available our investigative files oyer 15 years old

to legitimate researchers when such files pertained to an

individual or organization of historical significance.

The new amendments will now do away with these

restrictions.

Previously, when ve ascertained that the infornation

being sought was contained in an investigative file less-Eban

years old, we would deny the request, and the repartment'

Iequest Iot access to our investigation of President Kennedy's

assassination. It will be necessary for us, in our

investigative file to determine it the information falls with-

in one of the

its disclosura:

(1) interfare with enforcement proceedings,

(2) deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial

adjudication, (3) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal

privacy, (4) disclose the identity of a confidential source

end, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law

enforcenent authority in the course of a national security

intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished

only by the confidential source, (5) disclose investigative

techniques and procedures, or (6) endanger the life oI

physical safety of law enforcement personnel.

Our processing will be further complicated by the

changing of the word "fila" to "records" in the (b) (7) exenption.

In the pasi, even though a record, such as an airtel of

beDorandun contained innocuous

information, if it sas located

in an "investigatory file compiled for law enforcement purposes, "

we could preclude disclosure.

However, because the new

provisions order that, "Any reasonably segregabla portion of

a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record

after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this

subsection, *

we will now be required to look at such a

document and will have to disclose the contents if it does

not fall within one of the above-enumerated categories.

In

essence, we will now be required to look at a greater number

of files as well as a greater number of documents within these

files in processing requests under these new anendments.

IXCREASE IN NUMBER OF FILES INVOLVED

AS Doted abOvE:

since this law will suparcede

Departmental Sider 540-13÷

all our files will now be covered

by the FOIl, regardless of their age, FIon a review of the

words used in this bill, a reading of the legislative history

and

in discussions with staff representatives of various Senators

and Congressmen advocating this legislation, it is our under-

standing that a request can now be received for information

from an on going investigation and we would be required to

process such a request to determine is there was any infor-

nation contained therein that would zoi be protected under the

new provisions of the fOIA.

An example of

this could be a

requesi for our files on the Patricia Rearst case.

INCREASE IN NOMBER DE PEOPLE WED CAM NON REQUEST DATA

It is our understanding that anyone can now leguest

information fron our files and such a raquest will have to be

processed by us, even isi involves an elementary school student

wanting data for & tenu paper.

Since this new legislation will

require the coverment to absorb the cost of processing such

requests, the only cost that could act as a deterrent to a

young requester would be the time involved in our locating

the particular records involved and the duplicating charge of

ten cents per page.

Of the University of Texas who had requested infornation

concarning the Communist Party, which request involved close

to two million pages to be reviewed, will now come back with

the request nich he had previously withdrawn when he was advised

that the estimated cost of processing would amount to

300,000 dollars.

IN-CAMERA INSPECFION OR CLASSIPIED DOCUMENTS

under the old provisions of this Act, we could decline

to disclose classific documents, and, if subsequently challenged

in court, merely subnit an affidavit to the effect that these

documents have been properly classified pursuant to the most

secent Executive DIder.

The judge would go no further and

would sustain cur denial for access to such documents.

Under

the new legislation the judge may review such classified

jocuments during an in-camera inspection to determine if he

personally feels they were properly classified.

Implenentation of these new provisions is to take

place ninety days after enactment. In the interin, representatives

of the FOIA Unit are available to explain in depth some of the

problems contemplated under these amendments sinilar to the

explanations furnished Congressional stati members and Whiza

the follower spring marks on CE 141, 543, 544, 545 as they were

described to Mr. Rankin in Mr. Hoover's letter of June 6, 1964,

etc.) in relation to each other

Recalling my letter to you of December 3, 1973, when I asked for

the results of the neutron activation studies done on the several

metal fragments mentioned by Mr. Hoover in his letter of July

8, 1974, to Mr. Rankin, I should again now like to ask for these

results.

Anticipating that my requests for these neutron activation results

will be denied I should appreciate if you would provide me wlth

instructions for the internal appeal as set out in the new amendments

Adams' menorandum of Decenber 17, 1974, wherein it.

reconnended that the laboratory Diviaion review Keisberg's

request for information concerning the assassinstion of

Prosident Kennedy and idertify pertinent naterial available

which may satisty his request.

Weisberg indicates in his letter that he is

interested in "the report itself" or "the complete report

Archives, his request met extend beyond these documents.

The material avallable in this case falls into

three categories.

1. All of the background inormation

Exaninations by neutron activation were con

Deer Sir:

After exhausting my administrative remedios, I filed ô.A,

In it I

sought the described spectrographic analyses

made by the FBI.

for the warren. Commission which had been denied me.

The law has now been amended. I herewith request that you

reinstitute

this application for these analyses under the law

as smended.

The Department saw fit in this previous case

to make misrepre-.

sentations to the counts. I therefore want it to be clear

that I sought and now seek only the final scientific reports

on these tests.. Not raw materials, not laboratory work, only

the conclusions as embodied in the full report, or the report

itsolf.

Herewith I expand

that request to include similar neutron

activation testing, whether or not by the fBi, of those

same

odjects and materials, namely the bullet allegedly used in

the assassination, various fragments of bullet also allegedly

so used, snd the various objects said to have been in contect

with any or all of these.

Here also my request

is for the

complete report only.

Very truly yours,

Dear Mr. Kelley:

This is a request for information pursuant to the Freedom of Information

Act as amended (5 U.S.C. Sec. 552).

I request access to the following files for purpose of inspection, and it

I so choose copying:

1) Neutron activation analysis of the paralin casts of Lee

Harvey Oswald's hands and face.

2) Spectrographic analysis of all bullet fragments recovered

In the investigation of the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

As you know, the amended Act provides that if some parts of a file

are exempt from release that

"reasonably segregable" portions shall

be provided. I therefore, request that if you determine that any portion

of a requested document is exempt you provide me immediately with access

to the remainder of the document. I, of course, specifically reserve

my right to appeal any decision on your part which denies to me access

to any document or to any portion of any document and an examination of

a portion of a document may not be taken by you to be a waiver of my

right to examine all portions of all of the requested documents.

If you determine that some of the documents or any portion of any document

is exempt from release I request that you specifically advise me as to

which exemption you believe to be applicable and the specific reasons

therefor regarding any material you refuse to make available.

I believe that since it is likely that all of the requested material

may have been collected and maintained by you in one location there

should be no fee charge.

If you determine that a fee might be involved since the Act permits

you to reduce or waive the fees if that "is in the public interest

because furnishing the information can be considered as primarily

benefiting the public"

and since it is apparent that this request

is made in the public interest I request that you waive any such

Iee. Should there be any question about fees or in any other area,

please telephone me at (202) 546-7500.

I expect to receive a reply to this request within ten working days

as required by the amended Act.

In order to expedite processing of FOIA requests received

in the Legal Counsel Division requiring document review and/or comments

by other FBIQ divisions; the following procedures should be implemented

under normal circumstances:

Legal Counsel should prepare memorandum to the Assistant

Director di the FBISQ division Involved requesting review of material,

necessary comments, or other required action relating to the FOIA request.

The recipient FBIAQ division should handle the matter in accordance with

Legal Counsel's request and respond directly to Legal Counsel by addendur

to the memorandum or, i necessary, by memorandum. When all action

is completed, the final package including the reply to the initiator of the

FOIA request prepared by Legal Counsel would thereafter be sent to rae

I, however, there is some specific reason to notify me of the

receipt of the FOIA request as would be the case if te initiator was oi

particular interest to higher Bureau officials, or if good judgment would

otherwise dictate; I should be aware of the request, Legal Counsel should,

in those instances,. prepare the memorandur to me.

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION

PEQUESTS FOR RECORDS

The following informal guidelines have been received from Freedom

of Information Unit, Office of Legal Counsel, for use when they request

cost data concerning FOI record requests from outsiders.

1. FOI will calculate reproduction costs unless unusually

difficult, such as photographic reproduction of

spectrographic plates.

2. "Reproduction" time is not chargeable, but must be

absorbed by FBI.

3. Reviewing time, to determine if material may be

furnished under FOI Law, is not chargeable.

4. Searching time (separate clerical and agent) is chargeable

at the rate of $4/hour for clerks and $8/hour for agent.

Exact records must be kept to support affadavit by agent in

case of legal contest.

the purpose of this memorandun is to bring ku the

attention of all Bureau Officials and Supervisors information

and partinent quidelines, in addition to those contained in

attached proposed letter to ali SACs, resulting from the new

amendments to the FOIA.

Additional guidelines and observations

miil be submitted for consideration from tine

co time as expo-

rience gained under the provisions warrant.

Aiso, representatives

of the FOIA Unit will be available to aúdress Division confer-

ences regarding this Act.

As you have previously been advised, the Freedom of

Information Act (FOIA)

was recently amended and the amendments

became effective February 19, 1975. Copies of the FOIA incoI-

porating the recent amendments are now available and are

attached for your information. As can be seen fron the attached

reprint, the primary effect of the new amendments is. to increase

the administrative burden of processing requests under the act,

whiCh is being handled by the Legislative Matters Section, FOIA

Unit of the legal Counsel Division.

Occasionally, however, the

assistance of other Divisions will be necessary in resolving

questions concerning a particular request.

The amended Act has altered the previous Act in

three major areas of concern to the FBI.

Change in Exemption (b) (1). This exemption

ralates to classified national defense and foreign policy

the major change in this area is that the anended

result of

this provision, a revior of all classified docu-

Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams memo

Re:

Public Law 93-502

2. Change in Exemption (b) (7). The language of

this exemption has been changed from

"investigatory files"

under the old Act to "investigatory records" under the present

Act, and the bases for withholding records falling in this

categor; have been narrowed to six specified situations:.

The situations in which investigatory records may

be withheld are specified in the amended Act and may be briefly

described as follows:

Where release of the record would...

(1) interfere with enforcement proceedings (investigation or

prosecution) (2) deprive a person of a

fair trial (3) constitute

an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy (4) disclose the

identity of a confidential source (either a

paid informant

or any citizen furnishing information to us with an express

or implied assurance of confidentiality) (5) disclose investi-

gative techniques and procedures, or (6) endanger the life or

safety of law enforcement personnel.

3.

Processing of Requests. The amended Act has

imposed a statutory requirement that an agency respond to an

FOIA request by either denying or granting the request within

ten working days, or in certain specified instances within 20

working days.. As pointed out above, the amendments have also

drastically revised the "investigatory files" exemption and

now refers to "investigatory records."

The effect of these

two modifications is to greatly increase the administrative

burden of processing FOIA requests.

The change in the wording

from "files" to "records" requires a document-by-document review

of the files falling within the scope of the request. The exemp

tion for investigatory records is now such that it also requires a

page-by-page review to justify withholding of the information

The Act also requires that any

"reasonably segregable" portions of a record be made available

to the requester after the portions which are exempt have been

This means that any documents not exempt in their

entirety must be read and deleted on a paragraph-by-paragraph

basis.

As mentiored above, the nodification of the (b) (1)

exemption now requires us

to review the classification of

documents before the (b) (1) exemption is asserted.

AS

can

be seen from the above explanation, the bases

for withholding information in a closed investigatory file are

limited.

The two most froquently relied-on cremptions when

dealing

with an inactive invostigation are (b) (7) (C) (unwar-

ranted invasion of personal privacy) and () (7) (D) (information

furnished with an express or implied assurance of confidentialic).

Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams memo

Re:

Public Law 93-502

Assertion of these exemptions relies heavily on the assumption

that an individual who cooperates with this Bureau in the course

of an official investigation does not wish to have his identity

or the information he furnished released to the

subject of the

investigation or to third parties, unless this is necessary in

enforcement proceedings of a judicial nature. The Legal Counsel

Division is giving consideration to suggesting adoption of certain

procedures by the field in recording the results of our interviews

in order to strengthen our position in asserting these exemptions.

Before adoption of any such procedures, the views of other Divisions

as to the effect these procedures might have on dissemination of

information and

related problems will be solicited.

Additionally, to enable the FOIA Unit to comply

with the short statutory deadlines imposed by the Act,

normally

ten working days, it will be necessary for all other Divisions

•to cooperate expeditiously in the handling of these matters when

called upon to do so.

This will involve insuring that any mis-

directed FOIA requests received by other Divisions are transmitted

to the Legislative Matters Section, Room 4503, Justice Building,

Attention: FOIA Unit, by the most expeditious means avail-

able.

The time limit for response to a request generally

begins to run from the date the request is received in any

Division of FBI HQ. As the applicability of some of

the exemptions depend upon whether release of the information

requested would interfere with an ongoing investigation or

enforcement proceedings, it will on some occasions be necessary

for the FOIA Unit to consult with other Divisions concerning

their opinion as to the effect release of information would

have on an ongoing case. In some situations, also, the Division

handling the substantive violation may be consulted to provide

background data, in order to ascertain if the continued classi-

fication of a particular document is justified.

RECOMMENDATION:

The attached letter to all SACs be sent, which

explains the recent amendments to the FOIA and sets out

procedures for handling FOIA requests or inquiries received by

Field Offices.

The principal effect of the extensive amendment

to the investigatory files exemption, Section 552 (b) (7),

is to allow the withholding of records from our investigatory

files only in six specified ciscumstances which are set out

in the Act.

We anticipate that in handling these requests we

will rely heavily on subsection (b) (7) (D) which allows with-

holding of information furnished by an individual who is a

"confidential source."

The term

"confidential source" has

been interpreted in the legislative history of the Act and

through analysis of the Act by the Department of Justice, as

covering not only informants but any citizen. who furnishes

information to an agency with the express assurance of con-

fidentiality or under circumstances where such an assurance

could reasonably be inferred.

Efforts will be made during initial and follow-up

In-service training of Field Olice Legal Counsel, to cover

in detail the provisions of the Act.

Any inquiries concerning

other problems arising under the Act should be directed to the

Legislative Matters Section,

PURPOSE

This is to establish facts in order to respond to la

the inquiry of MI. Brown,

and to furnish any additional

documents as requested in his attached letter.

DETAILS

Mr. Brown has made previous requests and has been

furnished documents from the Laboratory through the Freedom of

Information/Privacy Acts (FOI/PA) Section in connection with

specific requests regarding the results of spectrographic and

neutron activation analyses.

He is now asking for any additional

worksheets which are available that he may not have requested in

the past.

It is the understanding of the FOI/PA Section that

neutron activation analysis examinations were done only on the

paraffin casts, (053A through Q53G) and the bullet fragments,

(Q1, 02, 04, 05, 09 and l14), and that he has received

these.

The file containing his previous requests

Is

forwarded

with this memo for the information of the Laboratory.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1.

That the Laboratory advise in addendum that FOI/PA

Section would be correct in telling Mr. Brown he has received all

reports

concerning neutron activation analysis.

LABORATORY ADDENDUM

J. W. Kilty:rle:

7/14/76 (Enclosures 16)

1. A review of 62-113452 indicates that Mr. Brown has

received the neutron activation analysis (NAA) data and results

on specimens el, 02, 04, l5, 09 and Q14.

These are the only

metal fragments

examined by NAA.

Mr. Brown has never requested

NAA data and results on the paraffin casts from Oswald's hands

(Q53A through Q53G) and the file does not show that these data

and results were ever furnished to him.

It is noted, however,

that he has never requested them.

Enclosed are four pages of information concerning

the

paraffin cast examination.

These pages may be released to

MI. BrOWn.

It is noted that the Laboratory has on hand the

"raw data" upon which the calculations on one of the four pages

are based. These "raw data" are not being released inasmuch as

then gay data.

Mr. Brown may have no interest in the paraffin casts at all.

There were no NAA examinations conducted on the lead.

smear found on Q609 nor any of the clothing from President Kennedy

or Governor Connally•

2.

Mr. Brown has been furnished with notes concerning

spectrographic examinations of specimens listed by him.

According.

to his April 21, 1976, letter, Mr. Brown appears to ask for any

spectrographic examination documents which are available.

Enclosed are notes and worksheets containing spectrographic

examinations conducted on the President's clothing (PC-78282) ,

Governor Connally's clothing (PC-80185), a wrist watch and ring

(PC-78339) and bullets from Officer Tippit (PC-79846). You should

Do ter at nations

be aware that the last two documents listed refer mainly to the

Tippit shooting and it may be difficult for Mr. Brown to figure

out sample designations and the reason for giving him these

documents. The Laboratory has no objection to the release of

these documents.

These documents have not been released to

Mr. Brown previously because he has never asked for them.

3. Agent time spent on this request was four hours.
