Title: JOHN E. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION

RECORDS COLLECTION ACT OF 1992

(THE ACT)

Synopsis: Denver indices searched regarding Judith Campbell

aka Judith Immoor; Judith Campbell; Judith Eileen Von

Immoor; Judy Campbell; Judy Exner, with negative results.

Enclosures: Enclosed for FBIHQ is the original FD-160 Indices

Search Slip.

Details: As instructed by FBIHQ EC to All Field Offices and All

Legats, dated 06/19/1997, Denver searched general indices,

confidential indices, Elsur indices, ACS, ISIS,

OCIS/CLEA, and

IIS/IIIA, for any files identical to above mentioned individual.

A search of all Denver indices failed to locate any

main files identical to Judith Campbell Exner or any of her

aliases.

There is

a serial reference in Denver's Bank Fraud

Control

File for a Mrs. Judy Campbell; however, a review of the

serial reference determined that this "Judy Campbell" is not

identical to Judith Campbell Exner.

FBIHQ is requested

to advise Denver if Headquarters

still needs to have the above mentioned serial reference sent in.

The serial will be sent

at that time.
