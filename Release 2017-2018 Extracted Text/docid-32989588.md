At 2:30 p.m. on June 2, 1975, a conference was held

with the Deputy Attorney General attended by K. William O'Connor,

Kevin Maroney, Philip White, and Robert McDermott of the Department.

Bureau representatives were Mr. Callahan, Mr. Adams, Mr. Wannall and me:

Mr. O'Connor discussed the request by the Senate Select

Committee for access to the 39 page report by former Assistant Attorney

General Petersen concerning COINTELPRO.

Though objections were

presented by the Bureau representatives that the report should not be

furnished to the Committee, and its enclosures, particularly the legal

memoranda should not be made available, the Deputy Attorney General

decided and instructed that the 39 page report should be made available

to John Ellitt on Tuesday, June 3, 1975, for his review, at which time he

would be permitted to take notes, but he would not be furnished a copy of

the document. The Deputy further instructed that should Mr. Elliff reques?

the attachments to the report, Mr. O'Connor should offer as an alternative®

the memoranda which initiated each & the COINTELPROS.

Principals-of-the-USIB-Ad Hoc Coordinating

Group

Ninth Meeting, 4 June 1975

I.

A meeting of the USIB Ad Hoc Coordinating Group'

was held on 4 June 1975 at 10:00 a.m. A list of attendees

is attached.

The meeting was opened by Dr. Clarke who described

the current activities of the Senate Select Committee in -

accelerating their reficial interviews with knowledgeable.

officials across the Community and the criticality of firming

up agreements on how these interviews are to be handled.

This has not been forthcoming despite White House interest.

House Select Committee procedure is not yet clear.

3.

The second

item raised by the Chairman was the

list of category II "abuses" which had been developed at

the direction of the Policy Steering Group.

The set developed

was the result of discussions with Mr. Schwardz, Counsel to

the Senate Select Committee, who plans to present a complete

list of "category II" items

to the Committee on Friday, 6

June.

At that point, it is expected "notices" would go out !

to the Community agencies advising them so that agreed

interview procedures will apply.

It is also anticipated

Has out :

that the presence of private as well as Agency counsel will

be addressed.

4.

In addition to the "category II" Items, there are

a number of additional subjects largely geographic in nature

for which the DCI feels CIA should assume responsibility

for preparing comprehensive papers.

In view of the

apparent adversary relationship between the Senate Select

Committee Staff and the agencies under investigation; it may

be that preparation of papers dealing comprehensively with

specific subjects will deflect some of this cross-agency

probing and result in a positive solution to problems before

they arise.

5.

The Chairman reminded the group of the responsibility

which exists to keep Mr. Cotter of the Post Office Department

informed on matters resulting from the Congressional investiga-

tions which will clearly impact on his agency's affairs.

present, the cross-agency character of the interviews now

under way indicate a possible communication gap in adequately

coordinating on postal matters.

•6. The Chairman explained the DCI's action taken in

late May to separate the responsibility for CIA's response

iu the congressional seleüi Cumutees from those responsi-

bilities of the IC Staff.

whether or not the senate Select Committee had

they plan to deal in depth.

reported there were no comparable facilities anticipated

there. Defense has provided badges to Staff members and

reading facilities are available.

The same accessability of

materials is true at NSA and FBI.

12.

The last subject on the agenda was the implementa-

tion of the Community Central Index.

In the material provided

to the

group was a letter reaffirming the purposes

of the

Central Index and a list of 40 key words to be used in

identifying material furnished the Index. A printout of the

Index content was provided to the

group as a review document

only. The final format of such periodic reports has not yet

been refined.

Group members are encouraged to comment if

they detect any problems with items in the printout.

Forms

for inputting information to the Central Index were also

provided to the Group. This is a service of common concern

which will assure the uniformity of information received and

should serve to lighten the workload of the individual

agencies.

The telephone number of Mrs. Young of the Central

Index was provided for agencies' convenience in accessing

the Index information.

of Alan G. Sentinella. Interview commenced 12:24pm, terminated 2:20pm.

Siedel at the outset identified self via credential as representative of

aforementioned Committee.

Mr. Siedel introduced by writer to Mr. Seymor Phillips of the FBI. The

writer explained to Siedel that following his telephone conversation, 5/9/75,

during which he stated he was interested in discussing matters related to the

King and Levison cases it was felt that such discussion might involve issues

currently sensitive to the Bureau. Accordingly the Atlanta Office was con-

tacted and subsequently the writer was contacted by Robert Olmert of the Bureau.

Mr. Olmert advised that if it was desired the Bureau would make available a

representative not for the purpose of participating in the interview but to be

available for advice. The writer stated he was interested in obtaining such

assistance. Accordingly during the morning of 5/12/75 Mr. Seymor Phillips

contacted the writer.

This is dictated immediately following interview by Siedel. No effort

is herein made to follow the chronology of questions presented by Siedel.

During the interview no notes or recording were made by writer. Will use

"Q" for question and "A" for answer. Questions (Q) were asked by Siedel and

answers (A) were given by writer.

A: Was it correct that matters concerning the King investigation were dis-

cussed openly over coffee by members of the Atlanta field office?

A: Matters relating to the King investigation were discussed by individuals

concerned therewith. I have no recollection during the period I was connected

with the investigation that it was discussed by everybody like the previous

night's ballgame might have been.

Q: Shortly after King received the Nobel Prize did a Bureau official William

Sullivan come to Atlanta?

A: It is my recollection King received the Nobel Prize sometime before the

case was assigned to me. I do not remember if Bureau official William Sullivan

visited Atlanta.

Q: Did Sullivan have any contact with Ralph McGill concerning King?

A: I do not know.

Q: Were taps (telephone) and bugs (microphone) used by Atlanta in connection

with King?

A: A tap (telephone) was utilized re King at his SCLC office and his residence.

Q: When were the bugs (microphone) utilized?

A: There were none.

Q: What was the purpose of the investigation of King?

A: Io determine whether King and/or SCLC were influenced by persons or groups

having communist tendencies.

Q: Did you feel the investigation was worthwhile?

A: I don't recall that I ever asked myself that question. It was an assign-

ment made by my employer and my responsibility to handle it.

Q: How did other agents feel about the illegal use of these taps?

A: The taps were not illegal. They were obtained through the authority of

the Attorney General.

Q: Did any agents express the opinion that these investigations were improper?

A: I do not recall specifically although Mr. Murtaugh may well have so stated.

Q: What electronic surveillance was used concerning Levison?

A: I do not know. Levison resided in New York City.

Q: Was Levison covered by the tap on King?

NY 55168 DocId:32989588 Page 39

## Page 40

-3-

A: Only to the extent that he was in contact with King. There was no tap

on Levison per se in Atlanta.

Q: Was there any physical surveillance of King?

A: I do not recall any physical surveillance of King as such. There was

surveillance conducted of individuals in contact with King and consequently

King would obviously have been physically surveilled. But such surveillance

was not on King directly.

Q: Did you participate in these surveillances?

A: Yes on several occasions.

Q: How many occasions?

A: I cannot recall.

Q: How long were you in Atlanta?

A: August 1960 - March 1971.

Q: What other offices did you serve in and when?

A: Baltimore, September 1948 - January 1949; Buffalo, January 1949 - August 1960; •

Atlanta, August 1960 - March 1971.

Q: Where were you born?

A: London, England.

Q: How long did you live there?

A: 9 years.

Q: Where did you live first when in this country?

A: In New Jersey approximately one year. I spent most of my growing up time

in Iowa.

Q: You entered the Bureau July 19:48 and left in March 1971?

A: That is correct.

Q: When was the King and SCLC case assigned to you?

_WW 55168 DocId: 32989588 Paye 40

## Page 41

-4-

A: I believe it was the early part or spring of 1965.

Q: How long had the investigation been going on before you got the case?

A: I really am not sure - possibly a year; it might have been longer.

A: How long did the investigation continue?

A: I cannot actually recall.

Q: Was it still going on when you left the Bureau?

A: Yes, regarding the SCIC.

Q: How long after King's death did the tap remain?

A: I cannot be sure. It seems as though it was discontinued a short time

after, however I believe it continued for a longer period of time on the SCLC.

Q: Did you have any contact with news media or clergy regarding King, SCLC,

or Levison?

A: No.

Q: What relationship was there with the Atlanta Police Department and

what electronic surveillance did it have of King, SCLC, or Levison?

A: Throughtout my entire period as agent in Atlanta I never had any informa-

tion as to what electronic surveillance may have been conducted by the Atlanta

Police Department. During the period of time I was concerned with King, SCLC,

Levison there was no discussion to my knowledge of these matters with the

Atlanta Police Department. Generally speaking the rapport with the police

department was good.

Q: Did you monitor the taps on King, SCLC?

A: No.

Q: What squad were you assigned to in the Atlanta Office?

A: Security. More correctly it was referred to as the Security and Racial

Squad.

Q: Who else was assigned to this squad? Was there a man named Harding?

A: Yes.

Q: What was his first name?

A: Charles.

A: Who else was assigned?

A: Your friend Murtaugh, a Richard Davis.

At this point the writer stated he preferred not to name additional per-

sonnel simply because he did not wish to feel that they might subsequently be

interviewed as a result. The writer stated he was confident that Siedel or

his agency had already been furnished all of these names by Mr. Murtaugh.

He was informed that in the writer's opinion the Bureau was fully able and

capable of furnishing this information Siedel opined it would be a waste of govern-

ment money to subpoena the writer to Washington in order to obtain these names.

Q: Did you develop any evidence relating to Levison's CP connections?

A: No.

Q: Did you read reports from New York regarding Levison?

A: Yes.

Q: Did these reports set forth information from taps and bugs?

A: The reports did not state source of information.

Q: Did you know the information came from taps (or bugs)?

A: I did not know directly but presumed that it did.

Q: What type of work was the Security Squad in Atlanta concerned with?

A: That squad primarily handled matters in the security category, racial

matters, and also civil rights matters.

Q: What kind of matters constituted racial matters besides SCLC?

MH 55168 DocId:32989588 Page 42

---

## Page 43

-6-

A: The investigation of SCLC was not a racial matter. It was concerned with

possible communist influence of the organization. The Ku Klux Klan was a

racial matter because it involved pressures between white and black persons.

Q: What organizations or individuals were investigated in the security

category?

A: I have had no contact with Bureau matters for over four years. At this

time I have no knowledge what effect my answer to your question might have

upon the current status of any matter of concern to the Bureau.

Siedel essentially repeated his question and endeavored to explain that

he had no desire to affect the Bureau's investigative status.

The writer advised his answer to the question remained as above. At

this point Siedel suggested the writer might wish to consult Mr. Phillips

which was done.

Writer consulted privately with Phillips. After which Phillips entered

the writer's office and told Siedel that if he was seeking the Bureau's policy

relative to security, racial and civil rights investigations, same was in

the Bureau's manuals available to the Committee. At this point Siedel said

he was not after policy but names of specific persons and organizations the

writer would now recall were under investigation.

The writer restated former answer to this question and explained to

Siedel that he did not consider himself so naive to suppose that any of the

information given to Sieel would not at some future time appear in print.

To which Siedel stated he would not be personally responsible therefore.

Siedel was informed the writer was not necessarily stating he would be personally

responsible therefore. Siedel pointed out that he could not require a different

answer to this question at the present time but went on to explain the writer

could be subpoenaed for this purpose for open or closed testimony.

Q: During the course of these investigations did you ever alter or fabricate

any document previously prepared?

A: No.

Q: Do you know of such having been done in the Atlanta Office?

A: No.

Q: Do you know of a tape recording pertaining to King which was sent to

Mrs. King?

A: Not during that period. It seems I might have heard such an allegation

but there has been so much material news media wise the past year or two,

I actually cannot be sure whether I read of such an allegation or might have

heard it said. In any case so far as I am concerned it was hearsay.

Q: What was your participation in COINTELPRO investigations and what did

they cover while you were in the Atlanta Office?

A: I left the Bureau over four years ago and have absolutely no knowledge of

what might be the present status of any investigation by the Bureau past or

present. I feel very strongly that any answer I might give could conceivably

adversely effect the Bureau's investigative position. For this reason I de-

cline to discuss this matter.

Siedel stated the Bureau had recently stated it had discontinued COINTELPRo.

The writer advised he was not aware of this; that his answer above remained the

same.

Q: Do you know of any effort by the Bureau to influence a political campaign?

A: No.

WRITER'S OBSERVATIONS

Siedel obviously was attempting to verify allegations made by other individuals.

2. All of his questions appeared to have been previously prepared in writing.

3. At one point he commented he was conducting this interview for a colleague

(not named).

4. Siedel did not appear satisfied with the results of the interview. It is

presumed he considers the writer's cooperation to be minimal.

5. As Siedel prepared to depart he was informed that during 23 years as an

agent the writer suffered some adverse administrative action; that these ulti-

mately proved to be experiences from which the writer profited. He was told

the writer had "no axe to grind" regarding the Bureau and no intent or desire

to accomplish any questionable literary fame.

6. Upon departing Siedel inquired

as to the proximity of the Equitable Building

(office building) and the First National Bank of Atlanta (also office building).

Any significance to these locations was not apparent to the writer. When

informed that banking hours terminated at 4:00pm Siedel made no comment.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

As consideration for employment in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), United

States Department of Justice, and as a condition for continued employment, I hereby declare

that I intend to be governed by and I will comply with the following provisions:

(1) That I am hereby advised and I understand that Federal law such as

Title 18, United States Code, Sections 793, 794, and 798; Order of the

President of the United States (Executive Order 11652); and regulations

issued by the Attorney General of the United States (28 Code of Federal

Regulations, Sections 16.21 through 16.26) prohibit loss, misuse, or un-

authorized disclosure or production of national security information, other

classified information and other nonclassified information in the files of

the FBI;

(2) I understand that unauthorized disclosure of information in the files

of the FBI or information I may acquire as an employee of the FBI could

result in impairment of national security, place human life in jeopardy, o

result in the denial of due process to a person or persons who are subjects

of an FBI investigation, or prevent the FBI from effectively discharging its

responsibilities. I understand the need for this secrecy agreement; there-

fore, as consideration for employment I agree that I will never divulge,

publish, or reveal either by word or conduct, or by other means disclose to

any unauthorized recipient without official written authorization by the

Director of the FBI or his delegate, any information from the investigatory

files of the FBI or any information relating to material contained in the files,

or disclose any information or produce any material acquired as a part of the

performance of my official duties or because of my official status. The burden

is on me to determine, prior to disclosure, whether information may be disclosed

and in this regard I agree to request approval of the Director of the FBI in each

such instance by presenting the full text of my proposed disclosure in writing to

the Director of the FBI at least thirty (30) days prior to disclosure. I understand

that this agreement is not intended to apply to information which has been placed

in the public domain or to prevent me from writing or speaking about the FBI but

it is intended to prevent disclosure of information where disclosure would be

contrary to law, regulation or public policy. I agree the Director of the FBI is

in a better position than I to make that determination;

(3) I agree that all information acquired by me in connection with my official

duties with the FBI and all official material to which I have access remains

the property of the United States of America, and I will surrender upon demand

by the Director of the FBI or his delegate, or upon separation from the FBI, any

material relating to such information or property in my possession;

(4) That I understand unauthorized disclosure may be a violation of Federal

law and prosecuted as a criminal offense and in addition to this agreement may

be enforced by means of an injunction or other civil remedy.

I accept the above provisions as conditions for my employment and continued employment

in the FBI. I agree to comply with these provisions both during my employment in the FBI and

following termination of such employment.

Office, met in Miller's office, prior to Nichol's appointment

for interview by members of the staff of the Senate Select

Committee.

at approximately 8:35 a.m. after Nichols stated he had not

been given a copy by anyone else. He advised Nichols that

nothing Miller was about to say was intended to or should

be interpreted as an order or suggestion to be uncooperative

with the Senate Select Committee or its staff:

represented by an attorney; if he is unable to retain an

attorney, he should so advise the Committee staff and ask them

Miller then advised Nichols he had the right to be

to assist him in securing counsel; and the FBI could not

provide the services of an attorney. Nichols said he

understood.

On the evening of 5-20-75 Deputy Assistant Attorney

Director Soc'y —

General K. William O'Conner telephonically advised SA Paul V. Daly

of the Legal Counsel Division that the Department had reached a decision

concerning the scope of testimony to be allowed in the Senate Select

committee interview of former SA Alan G. Sentinella. We previously

had intormed the Department that Mr. Sentinella was to testify pursuant

to a subpoena before this Committee and that Department of Justice Order

501-73 requires we obtain Departmental approval before testimony may

be given.

We also informed the Department that Lester B. Seidel, staff

member of the Senate Select Committee, had advised SA Daly that the

scope of the intended interview of Sentinella would include knowledge

Sentinella may have concerning the investigations of Martin Luther King,

Stanley David Levinson, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

(SCLC). Mr. Seidel also indicated that they would interview Sentinella

concerning his activities between the years 1960 to 1971.

Mr. O'Conner advised SA Daly that the decision of Deputy

Attorney General Harold R. Tyler; Assistant Attorney General Antonin

Scalia, and Associate Deputy Attorney General Robert McDermott was that

Sentinella was released insofar as the Department was concerned to only

discuss three areas, those areas being the FBI investigations of Martin Luther

King, Stanley David Levinson, and SCLC. He was to advise the Committee

that he was not permitted to go outside of these three areas because of

instructions from the Department of Justice which instructions were issued

pursuant to Department of Justice Order 501-73.

On 5-21-75 former

SA Sentinella was advised of the

Departmental restrictions on the information he could furnish the Committee

by SA Daly, and he was accompanied by SA Daly to the Senate Select Committee

office located in G308 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building®

Sentinella's

interview was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Mr. Seidel met Mr. Sentinella and

at 9:31 a.m. furnished Mr. Sentinella a copy of the Rules g

RE: SENSTUDY 75

the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to

Intelligence Activities. At the same time, former SA Sentinella was furnished

forms which Seidel requested he fill out at that time. Seidel also made

reference to Sentinella's Fifth Amendment rights but did not specify or spell

out his rights.

It was brought to Mr. Seidel 's attention by SA Daly that the Rules

adopted by the Senate Select Committee called for a witness to be given copies

of the Rules 24 hours prior to his appearance before the Committee and that

these Rules are important for a potential witness to have knowledge of prior to

his being interviewed since they contain a list of rights and privileges which a

witness is entitled to. It was also brought to Mr. Seidel 's attention that despite

the fact that the interview was to be initiated at 10 a.m. (initially the interview

was scheduled for 9:30 a.m., however, upon arrival former SA Sentinella was

advised it would not be held until 10 a.m.) with Mr. Sentinella being required

to fill out forms, he would have very little opportunity to review and digest the

Rules of the Committee.

Mr. Seidel was also advised of the restrictions placed on the

area which former SA Sentinella could respond to by the Department of Justice.

Mr. Seidel specifically requested that he be allowed to ask questions concerning

"COINTELPRO. He was advised that this was not within the scope of the

Department's release for Sentinella unless such information may have been

related to the investigations of Martin Luther King, Stanley David Levinson, or

SCLC.

SA Daly also explained to John Elliff, Task Force Head for the

Committee on Domestic Intelligence Matters,

the circumstances surrounding

the failure to provide a copy of the Rules 24 hours prior to interview and of the

lack of specificity of Mr. Seidel as to areas/which Mr. Sentinella would be

interviewed.:

Mr. Elliff apologized for the oversight of the Committee

in complying with its Rules and assured SA Daly this would not happen again.

In addition, he was advised that the Rules of the Committee provide that witnesses

would have a reasonable opportunity to inspect and correct their testimony,

however, the Rules provide that a witness must inspect his testimony in the

office of the Committee. It was pointed out to Mr. Elliff that such procedures

were unreasonable in that in Mr. Sentinella's instance, he would have to travel

from Atlanta to Washington, D. C., to review the transcript of his testimony at

his own expense. Mr. Elliff indicated that he believed other arrangements

concerning this particular aspect of the Rules could and would be worked out.

Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams

RE: SENSTUDY 75

Mr. Sentinella at the conclusion of his testimony advised SA Daly,

who was not present at the testimony, that the Committee adhered to the restrictions

placed on his testimony by the Attorney General with one possible exception. They

asked Mr. Sentinella if while he was working in Atlanta his squad investigated the

"Klan"' and "SNCC" (Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee). Sentinella

advised he did not raise an objection to this question because he felt the deviation

from the Deparrmental restrictions was very slight, and our investigations of

these matters well known.

On the afternoon of 5-21-75 K. William O'Conner inquired of

SA Daly how the interview went and he was generally advised of the facts surrounding

the interview, including the fact that former SA Sentinella was not furnished a copy

of the Rules until immediately preceding the interview. Mr. O'Conner inquired

as to whether the Senator ('Senator Robert Morgan D-N. C.]) remained during the

taking of testimony from Mr. Sentinella, and he was advised that according to

Sentinella, Senator Morgan departed approximately five minutes after placing

Mr. Sentinella under oath.

Mr. O'Conner expressed his displeasure at the way the Committee

operated and indicated he was going to discuss this matter with Deputy Attorney

General Tyler.

Subsequently, on 5-21-75 O'Conner indicated he had been in contact

with James Wilderotter, assistant to the Counsel to the President, and Deputy

Attorney General Tyler, and they want the Bureau to prepare a letter protesting

the Committee's handling of the interview of Sentinella and of the fact that they

violated Rules which were adopted by that Committee, specifically the Rules

requiring Mr. Sentinella be furnished a copy of the Committee Rules 24 hours

prior to giving testimony to the Committee, failure to be specific concerning the

areas to be covered by Sentinella's testimony, the general manner in which the

rights of Sentinella were explained to him, and the fact that Senator Morgan

departed from the Committee session after giving the oath. O'Conner explained

in this regard Deputy Attorney General Tyler feels that this is in contravention

of the Rules of the Committee, and he questions whether an executive session of

the Committee being held to hear such testimony can continue in the absence of a

Senate Committee Member. He requested this letter be directed to Senator

Church. He was advised that such a letter could only be prepared after approval

had been obtained from proper Bureau authorities, and it was also pointed out

to Mr. O'Conner that we had orally protested this matter to Mr. Elliff of the

Committee and Mr. Seidel, and he was apprised of Elliff's statement that such

mistakes would not be repeated in the future. It was pointed out to Mr. O'Conner

that the Bureau had furnished former SA Sentinella a detailed briefing of his

rights and a briefing as to what was contained in the Rules of the Committee

prior to his interview.

Mr. O'Conner again requested that we prepare a letter

protesting this matter.

It is not felt that a letter concerning this particular matter should

be directed to Senator Church in view of Mr. Elliff's statement that this

incident will not be repeated in the future.

It is felt that our oral protest to the

Committee is sufficient at this point, especially inasmuch as they accepted the

limitations placed on the testimony of former SA Sentinella by the Department.

at this d pear we could expect to achieve very little by sending such a letter

Honorable Frank Church, Chairman

United States Senate Select Committee

on Intelligence Activities

Washington, D. C. 20510

Dear Senator Church:

It is my understanding that the continuing efforts of

staff members of the Executive and Legislative Branches to

prepare standard guidelines for witness interview procedures

are continuing this week. While that process continues, the

Department of Justice is, of course, continuing to cooperate

in an ad hoc and respotsive manner.

In order, to ensure our

attention to these cooperative efforts, I have designated

K. William O'Connor as Special Counsel for Intelligence

Coordination and as such he will be the (principle liaison

officer of DOJ in this effort.

I understand that your Chief

Counsel and members of his staff are now dealing with

Mr. O'Connor in the execution of their responsibilities.

In the meantime, in an effort to expedite the coopera-

tive provision of appropriate information to SSC, It would be

most helpful if the Connittee Staff would ensure.

most tipto fitti to tree sta lange or cohat the

This would facilftate the interview process, since it would

make it possible to ensure that appropriate instructions are

issued to the witness under 28 CFR 16.22, and would permit

early decision upon the release of any applicable secrecy

agreements.

* In the same vein, I should like to invite your attention

to some procedural matters surrounding recent witness presenta-

tion before the Committee. It appears, from reports which.

have received, that two former FBI. agents who recently appeared,

did not receive copies of the Committee's _Rules of Procedures

until Innedlately before appearance before the Committee; and

that the scope of their proposed testimony' was defined with

somewhat less than optimum precision for pre-clearance. Some

procedural problens are almost inevitable, especially in the

early stages of hearings. I know that you share my interest

in assuring that full procedural due process is unequivocally

provided to all witnesses who testify before the Committee or

are interviewed by Connittee Staff. In calling this matter to

your attention I seek your support in restricting such problems

to a minimum and prospectively avoiding others of like kind.

Sincerely,

The purpose of this memorandum is to advise that a

Director Soc'y -

representative of captioned Committee has advised that if the Bureau's

response to a Committee request concerning the Democratic Convention

in Atlantic City in 1964 is sufficiently informative it may not be necessary

to interview Bureau personnel concerning this matter and to recommend

that an expeditious effort be made to furnish a summary concerning the

Atlantic City investigation be made available along with certain documents

concerning this matter.

By way of background, we have received a reque st dated

5-14-75 pertaining to many items, among which was information concerning

the Bureau's activities in Atlantic City in 1964 at the Democratic National

Convention. At a meeting on 5-30-75 it was pointed out to the Committee

that certain aspects of their May 14, 1975, request were particularly

burdensome, would in some instances invadé privacy and for other reasons

was most alticult. During this meeting which was attended by Mark Giterstein,

staff member of the Committee; John Elliff, Task Force Director;

representatives of the Bureau; and K. William O'Conner, Special Counsel

to the Deputy Attorney General for Intelligence Coordination, the Committee

representatives indicated that subject to the Senate Committee's approval

they would accept some sort of summary with

regard to their request in

Appendix D, Item 8 of the May 14, 1975, request. This item pertains to

the Bureau's activities in Atlantic City.

We have had former Agents interviewed concerning this

matter, a request has been made to interview two Bureau secretaries, and

the Committee has indicated they intend to interview as many as five

additional Bureau Agents concerning this matter.

In conversation with

K. William O'Conner, he mentioned that the Committee had specifically

informed him that if the Bureau's response was informative enough concerning

RE: SENSTUDY 75

the Atlantic City matter, they would not interview the two Bureau

secretaries, Mary Ann Massa and M. Ann Mierzejewski. (The request

concerning the interview of these Bureau employees, who are Newark

Office employees, is the subject of a separate memorandum captioned

and dated same.) He requested SA Paul V. Daly to contact Mark

Gitenstein in an effort to determine what type of response the Committee

expected concerning the Atlantic City incident.

-On 6-4-75, SA Daly contacted Mr. Gitenstein and Mr. Gitenstein

advised that the Committee knew of the existence of certain memoranda

and in particular a memorandum from former Assistant to the Director

C. D. DeLoach reporting a conversation with the President requesting Bureau

coverage at the Convention. Gitenstein stated that with regard to the

Atlantic City incident, if a summary was prepared concerning this incident

which would in general show the types of people whose conversations were

monitored, the type of information collected, and the type of information

disseminated along with furnishing the Committee certain important documents

that it would not be necessary to interview Bureau personnel. He indicated

among the documents they would expect to be furnished would be the DeLoach

memorandum along with other "benign"' documents which would not involve a

privacy consideration or other considerations which might preclude their

being made available tothe Committee. Gitenstein indicated that it is the

Committee's feeling that information of a political nature such as the

credentials argument at the Convention was collected and furnished to the

White House and that the collection and dissemination of this information is

not apparently in concert with the ostensive purpose of electronic surveillance.

He felt that the summary need not and should not identify individuals monitored

but rather describe them such as a senator or some other descriptive phrase

to describe the individual whose conversation might have been monitored.

He said as to the verification of the information contained in the summary

with the information in the files, that subject will be addressed by the

Committee at a later time.

Gitenstein again mentioned that if such information was

furnished by the Bureau, their need to interview employees would be muted

as what they are attempting to learn through interview of Agents involved

, would have already been furnished by the Bureau. He volunteered that the

Committee is relatively well informed concerning this particular matter.

It is obvious from the specific mention of the DeLoach memorandum along

with other observations and statements he made that this could well be true.

Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams Memo

RE: SENSTUDY 75

It is realized that the White House has requested that a

paper be prepared which would include the Atlantic City incident; however,

K. William O'Conner indicated that he had conversed with

Mr. James Wilderotter, assistant to the Counsel to the President, and

that Wilderotter had advised that document requests pertaining to

Atlantic City or any other topic which will be addressed in a paper should

be responded to and response should not be delayed.

It would appear to be advantageous to the Bureau to attempt

to comply with the summary request along with furnishing certain documents

concerning Atlantic City on an expeditious basis as opposed to the Committee

continuing to conduct interviews of current and former Bureau personnel.

If this type of arrangement can be worked out in this particular incident

which the Committee characterizes as an abuse, it might lend itself to a

similar arrangement in other areas.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Intelligence Division expeditiously prepare a

summary in line with the above concerning the Atlantic City incident along

with furnishing the important documents concerning this incident.

Attached teletype advises former

Agent Richard H. Davis, Atlanta Office, had

been contacted by Senate Select Committee (SSC)

Staff Member (FNU) Epstein in an attempt by

Epstein to arrange an interview concerning

Bureau investigation of Martin Luther King.

On the night of 6-4-75, Michael Epstein, Staff

Member SSC advised SA Paul V. Daly that he had

contacted former Agent Davis to arrange inter-

view concerning Bureau investigation of Martin

Luther King, Stanley David Levison,, and

Southern Leadership Christian Conference (SLCC).

Epstein stated Davis refused to submit to inter-

view since he was bound by an employment

secrecy agreement and needed necessary clear-

ance from Bureau. He told Epstein that he

would not contact Bureau for such clearance.

Epstein requested Bureau release Davis from

the agreement for purposes of this interview

which will be a staff interview in Atlanta.

Legal Division recommends Davis be

released from security agreement for purposes

of this interview and to answer questions

concerning the King, Levison, and SLCC investi-

gations. If approved, we will separately

advise Davis through Atlanta Office of this

decision, and give him pertinent briefing.

The following matters of interest were discussed at the

meeting:

House Select Committee on Intelligence Activities

Mr. Colby said he met earlier this week with Chairman

Nedzi of the House Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, John I.

Boos, Chief Counsel, and A. Searle Field, Committee Staff Director.

He said they seemed interested in the relationship which had developed

between the Senate Committee and CIA and asked where he thought the

Senate inquiry was going. They also discussed procedures regarding access.

• to documents and witnesses and requested they be furnished some basic

' materials concerning the CIA's authority to conduct intelligence investigations.

They also requested that the Committee be provided with all the materials

requested by the Senate Select Committee. Colby pointed out that the

House Resolution (H-Res. 138) which established the Select Committee

prohibits the disclosure of information outside the Committee without

• Committee approval. There is some question, however, whether this

Resolution can supersede Rule 11 of

Re: SENSTUDY 75

which provides that members of the House shall have access to all

Committee records. He said Congressman Robert N. Giaimo (D-Conn.)

has indicated that he will not accept any limitations on access. Colby

said he will appear in an open session before the Committee sometime

in the next few weeks to discuss, in general terms, the agency's position on

collection of intelligence information.

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities

Mr. Wilderotter said that F. A. O. Schwarz, Counsel to

the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, has agreed to identify

in advance specific allegations of abuse that will be reviewed by the

Committee. Wilderotter said he will then appoint a task force or some

other coordinating mechanism within the executive branch to examine each

of these areas in depth. The purpose will be to develop an executive

department brief on each subject which can be used to respond to Committee

requests. He felt that this might enable the Administration to gain the

initiative on these issues and perhaps limit the Committee's inquiries to the

boundaries set forth in the Senate Resolution. He asked that the agencies

make an effort to identify abuse subjects so that the White House can pull

together all the information available on each topic. He said it is already

clear that the Committee will examine such subjects as assassinations

and the CIA's role in the internal affairs of Chile and the Dominican Republic.

Mr. E. H. Knoche, Assistant to the Director, Central

Intelligence Agency, reported that Mr. Colby has made three appearances

before the Senate Select Committee and on each occasion discussed

assassination matters. Mr. Colby will meet with the Committee three times

next week, and it is expected that he will be asked about the Phoenix program

and the covert activities of the CIA including political, counterintelligence,

and clandestine intelligence collection. The Committee will trace the agency's

operations back to the 1947 directive in an effort to determine how they

relate to policy objectives of the Government.

Mr. William G. Hyland, Director of Intelligence and Research,

Department of State, said the Committee has requested position papers

on the Department's activities in Laos and Chile and to explain of the Depart-

ment's approach to covert action and whether it was a supplement or instrument

of policy. Mr. Hyland raised the question of whether the agencies had any

moral obligation to advise former employees that documents were now being

made available to Congress. He felt that they should be given an opportunity

to review these files prior to interview in order to refresh their memories.

Mr. Wilderotter agreed and said that each agency should adopt a similar

policy.

Mr. John M. Clarke, Associate Deputy to the DCI, asked

whether anyone knew what John Elliff hoped to accomplish as Director of

the Task Force on Domestic Intelligence. We pointed out that his earlier

writings would indicate that he intends to draft an intelligence charter for

the FBI, and perhaps the entire intelligence community. Elliff has made

a comprehensive study over the past several years of the Bureau's internal

security intelligence functions, including sources of the FBI's authority and

the legal restrictions of its operations. This was the subject of a paper he

submitted at the Princeton Conference in 1971, and he has since called for

the establishment of legal standards for the Bureau's collection, retention,

and dissemination of intelligence information.

Mr. Buchen then requested that the FBI draft a proposed

intelligence charter for the Bureau. He felt that it would be helpful for

the Administration to have a proposal available which it might use to counter

any recommendations made by the Committee. At the end of the meeting

Mr. Wilderotter

asked that a second paper be prepared reviewing all

of Mr. Elliff's articles on the subject of domestic intelligence with the

view toward identifying those issues which seem to be of major importance.

With regard to Mr. Buchen's request, we feel that it would

be inappropriate for the Bureau to draft an intelligence charter for the

executive branch. It is the responsibility of the White House and other

consumers of intelligence to define their needs and propose appropriate

operating authority. We also question the utility of reviewing Professor

Elliff's writings on the domestic intelligence functions. We feel a better

course of action at this point is simply to ask Mr. Elliff to define the goals

and objectives of his task force. He has always been very candid and forthright

and we have no reason to think that he would be reluctant to discuss the matter

with us. In addition, it is likely his views on the intelligence function differ

from those expressed in his earlier articles, and it is best to get his current

thinking on the problem. If this approach proves unsuccessful, we can then

resort to a review of his written materials.

No information has been developed indicating this Bureau

ALL INFORMATION COMANE

At 4:55 p.m. on June 4, 1975, Daniel M. Armstrong,

telephonically advisa me that he has not as yet been contacted by the til

Senate Select Committee staff for interview but it was his intention

to call Mark Gitenstein to discuss further his interview by the Committee.

Mr. Armstrong inquired as to whether the Bureau has any objections to

his discussing the two subject areas previously described by Mr. Gitenstein.

Those areas were Armstrong's knowledge of the Bureau's Intelligence

Division activities as a result of his employment in the FBI, and his

knowledge of the possibility of the Bureau getting an Executive Order

establishing the FBI's authority in security matters.

I advised Mr. Armstrong that to the extent that the interview

would concern those two subjects, the Bureau would have no objection

and he could consider his secrecy agreement waived, but only to that

extent. Mr. Armstrong inquired as to whether there were any particular

problems with information he furnished to me on May 28, 1975. I told

him that the waiver of the agreement was conditioned on the one limitatio

that he would not furnish information that would identify informants,

compromise current investigations, or on-going programs, or reveal

other sensitive matters which should be reserved for the information of .

members of the Committee or the Chairman of the Committee.

I told Mr. Armstrong that the Bureau would have available

during his interview, though not present at the interview, a representative

who would provide him with counsel as to any problems concerning subjects

he may be reluctant to discuss with the Committee representative. I

explained that the FBI represent

Memorandum W. E. Harward to Mr. Cochran

RE :

SECURITY SURVEYS - SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE

ACIIVITIES - HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES -

CAPITOL POLICE DEPARTMENT

At the conclusion of this conference, Chief Powell expressed

his sincere appreciation to the Bureau for the excellent help and

guidance extended to him and his staff in this matter of mutual interest,

and expressed the hope that he could call on us again in the event he

or his staff needed to tap our resevoir of knowledge. The Chief was

assured that we would be available if needed in this capacity.

It appears that the Capitol Police Force has been forced into

the untenable position of handling this responsibility for the Congress, .

and as a result are attempting to establish some degree of self-reliance

and outward credibility being completely inexperienced in this area of

technical expertise.

Because of this, it is felt that the Bureau should

move cautiously in any continuing liaison with the Capitol Police

concerning security survey matters.

• RECOMMENDATION:

It is recommended that any continuing liaison with the

Capitol Hill Police Force be handled by mature and experienced

Special Agent Supervisors, who are completely familiar with security

survey matters.

discussion the question of the procedures to be followed when former employees

or current employees of the Bureau are contacted for interview by staff

representatives of the Senate Select Committee, or are called for testimony

pursuant to a subpoena issued by the Committee. I explained the background

including the numerous attempts to arrive at a working arrangement with

the Committee in terms of stated guidelines and that all such efforts in the

past had proven unworkable.

I pointed out that when presented with the proposal that an agency

representative be present during interviews, the Committee met and voted

unanimously to reject that proposal.

The issue of whether the agency

representative would be present during the interview therefore is a stumbling

block to the development of a reasonable procedure to be followed by the

Committee and by our present and former employees. I requested the (

authority of the Executives Conference and approval of the Director to waiv

the requirement that a Bureau representative be present during interview.

and following a vote such approval was given.

I then requested authority to undertake the development of a

working understanding with the Committee in behalf of the Bureau by which

we would be given notice of the identities of persons to be interviewed prior to

interview or testimony, that we would be advised of the subject matter of the

interview or testimony, and afforded an opportunity to discuss with the

witness those areas of the proposed interview or testimony which would

require no special arrangements and those areas which would require the

information possessed by the witness to be furnished to members of the

Committee or to the Chairman exclusively.

We also wanted an opportunity prior to interview to furnish the

witnesses information concerning their Constitutional rights, their rights

pursuant to the Committee's rules, and to advise them concerning the extent

to which they were released from obligations of secrecy made to the FBI, and

to the procedures necessary to obtain authority of the Department to respond

to a subpoena.

Following discussion and vote this matter also was approved.

Pursuant to such authority, I met with K. William O'Connor,

Deputy Assistant Attorney General, from approximately 4:00 p.m. to 5:20 p.m.

on May 22, 1975, accompanied by Inspector JOhn B. Hotis. I explained to

Mr. O'Connor that the Director was desirous of having the Committee under-

stand that the FBI wanted to be cooperative to the extent that it was possible

and consistent with the need to protect the identities of informants, sensitive

sources of information and methods, on-going investigations and other current

operations and personal privacy. Because of this view of the Director and the

Bureau, we desired to make known to the Committee the fact that we would

not insist on the presence of a Bureau representative during actual interviews

of testimony of present or former employees, but we would want an under-

standing with the Committee and the Committee staff that the Bureau would

be given prior notice of the identities of proposed witnesses, the subject

matter of the proposed interview or testimony, and an opportunity prior to

interview or testimony for the Bureau to consult with the employee in order

to release him from his obligations of secrecy to the extent possible for

purposes of the interview or testimony.

I restated our position that we were not endeavoring to deter

testimony rather we were attempting to facilitate testimony under reasonable

conditions and we felt that these matters should be discussed with the

Committee. I told Mr. O'Connor that we were aware of the numerous

discussions, proposals and conferences that have been held in an effort

to establish specific formal guidelines with the Committee, but that all such

efforts in behalf of the White House staff and the intelligence community at

Re: Senate Select Committee, etc.

large have not been successful. I told him that therefore we felt it would

be appropriate for the FBI to express our view to the Committee because

interviews of FBI personnel and former employees have been conducted

and are scheduled in the near future.

Mr. O'Connor said that he understood the Director's view that

he desired to cooperate with the Committee and he felt that such cooperation

could be negotiated if we were to offer the Committee as trading material

COINTELPRO files. I told Mr. O'Connor that we were not going to negotiate

an understanding concerning witness interview procedures on the basis of

trading any of our files. He then suggested that we negotiate the May 14,

1975, letter which was addressed to the Attorney General by Senator Church

and use that negotiation as a basis for trading with the Committee to develop

workable guidelines. I again told Mr. O'Connor that I considered the question

of procedural arrangements for witness interviews to be a very broad question and

one that went far beyond the requests in the May 14, 1975, letter. I told him

that I felt confident that the May 14, 1975, letter would be followed by perhaps

an even longer letter with more requests and that such matters should be

negotiated individually.

Mr. O'Connor then said that it was his strong view that a letter

should be addressed to the Committee complaining of the treatment of FBI

witnesses, particularly regarding violations of the Committee's own rules

in that it appeared that during recent interviews the Committee had not

furnished witness a copy of the rules in sufficient time and the treatment by

staff representatives (& the Committee staff)of witnesses had been improper.

I told Mr. O'Connor that I thought that our efforts to develop

a working relationship with the Committee could be seriously impaired at

this time should a protest letter be sent to Senator Church because a formal

communication of that nature would require some reaction on the part of the

Committee and I could see no benefit to our present efforts to establish

procedures by which we could reasonably cooperate with the Committee.

Mr. O'Connor then suggested that a letter might be addressed

to Senator Church which described our concern that in the absence of

reasonable procedures witnesses' rights might be impaired and that for that

Re: Senate Select Committee

reason and for the reason that the Director desired to be cooperative with

the Committee, we would request a meeting with Senator Church and

Senator Tower to arrive at an understanding as to procedures. I told

Mr. O'Connor that I would consider such a letter and he would discuss

the matter with the Deputy Attorney General and with James Wilderotter

at the White House.

At approximately 9:05 a.m. on May 23, 1975, Mr. O'Connor

called me and said that he had discussed the matter with Mr. Wilderotter

and the Deputy Attorney General. He said that both had agreed that it was

inopportune at this time to seek special guidelines for interviews of FBI

personnel and former personnel with the Committee. He said that a meeting

has been scheduled for Tuesday, May 27, 1975, at noon in a final

effort to resolve an understanding with Committee representatives.

He

said at the present time it is proposed that the meeting be attended by

Wilderotter and Roderick Hills, representing the White House; Hoffman,

representing the Defense Department;

JFK Act 6 (1) (A)

and

O'Connor representing the Justice Department. Committee representatives

would be Schwarz, Chief Counsel, and John Elliff. He said that at this

time it was his thought that the Deputy Attorney General and I should not

attend the meeting.

He gave as his reasoning the thought that "should

something go wrong" the Deputy Attorney General could disassociate himself

from any agreement arrived at, and that I would similarly be in a position

of saying that we have not been a party to the agreement.

I reminded Mr. O'Connor that meetings have been held frequently

in the past and that tentative understandings made at such meetings have dis -

appeared shortly after the meeting was concluded. I told him that was

significant to us because we now understand that two more former

employees of the FBI have been contacted and may be interviewed in the

near future. I told him that former SA Sam Papich and former Agent Nichols

have been contacted. I told him that the extent to which we should release

these two former employees from their obligation of secrecy could not be

intelligently evaluated unless we.: knew the subject matter of the interviews

and that we plan to contact the Committee to inquire as to the subject

matter. I pointed out to him that such pending interviews make it imperative

for the FBI to consider action in addition to meetings that may be planned

to discuss guidelines.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: Senate Select Committee

Mr. O'Connor asked that we not contact the Committee directly

at this time, but that we allow him to call John Elliff and Schwarz to

request that he be advised of the identity of all proposed FBI witnesses

and of the subject matter of the proposed interviews, and that such inter-

views or testimony not go forward pending developments of an agreement

on guidelines. O'Connor promised that he would make the contact promptly

and advise me today of the results. I agreed to withhold our contact

pending receipt of the information from him.

Mr. O'Connor then insisted that a letter be prepared for the

Attorney General to send to Senator Church pointing out the failure of the

Committee to afford complete protection of the rights of witnesses. I

declined to undertake that responsibility and I told him the reason was that

a formal document addressed to the Chairman of the Committee would tend

to impair our efforts to negotiate with the Committee and certainly would be

untimely in view of the conference he described as being scheduled for next

Tuesday at noon.

Mr. O'Connor then said he would hate to have to tell the Deputy

Attorney General that the FBI declined to prepare such a draft. I told him

that not only would I not mind him telling the Deputy Attorney General, but

I wished he would tell the Deputy Attorney General and explain my reason

for not sending such a formal letter addressed to Senator Church at this

time. Mr. O'Connor said that "well everyone else agrees to the letter, "

and I told him the FBI does not agree.

Mr. O'Connor said that if he was going to have to draft the

letter for the Attorney General's signature, he would do it, but that he would

need the information concerning the interviews of former SA Devlin and

former SA Sentinella. I told Mr. O'Connor that the information concerning

Sentinella was en route to him already and that we would endeavor to

furnish him as promptly as possible any additional information available

to us concerning these interviews.

At 11:13 a.m. on May 23, 1975, Mr. O'Connor called me and

said that he had just concluded a conversation with John Elliff during which

Elliff agreed that in regard to the scheduled interview of former SA Sam Papich

on May 29, 1975, at 9:00 a.m., he would furnish us the substance of the

Re: Senate Select Committee

questions to be asked Mr. Papich. He said that Elliff was agreeable to

an informal arrangement under which the FBI would not require the

presence of a Bureau representative at such interviews, but would expect

to receive the identity of persons to be interviewed plus a statement as to

the subject matter of the interview. Elliff then proceeded to identify as

those persons scheduled for interview as William Turner, who will be

interviewed today or this weekend by Mike Epstein at San Francisco, and

"Chick" Brennan, who was interviewed yesterday, May 22, 1975, by Mark

Gitenstein and who may be interviewed again today.

As to the interview of Sam Papich, Elliff said that the interview

would concern:

1. A liaison agreement between the FBI and CIA;

2. The abolition of Papich's liaison responsibilities in 1970;

3. Dissatisfaction by the FBI with the Huston Plan;

4. The views in the White House regarding the intelligence

community and the FBI with reference to a conversation Elliff had with

Mr. Wannall and Mr. Cregas on May 22, 1975;

5. A detailed follow-up on the discussions with Mr. Wannall;.

6. A copy of the Huston Plan and certain minutes taken of

meetings at which the Huston Plan was discussed. These minutes allegedly

were made by William Cregar;

7. The matter raised with Paul Daly on May 22, 1975. (Mr. Daly

recalled that Mr. Elliff discussed an incident concerning the CIA and the

FBi which occurred at Denver, Colorado.)

Mr. O'Connor said that an interview proposed with former

SA Nichols has been postponed indefinitely according to Elliff because

of Nichols' unavailability.

Re: Senate Select Committee

Mr. O'Connor noted that even though formal encent rules

have not been agreed upon with the Committee, it appears that Elliff's

cooperation in furnishing the above information indicates a willingness

to abide by the terms and conditions that I had requested Mr. O'Connor

to seek in behalf of the FBI.

In this developing cooperation with Elliff, it is my opinion that

we should not participate in the conference at noon on Tuesday, May 27, 1975,

at which time the broad proposals by Wilderotter will be discussed. It is

va, 17 1s

to the interest of the FBI to develop a cooperative attitude on the part of

Elliff and his staff and that is being accomplished.

At 10:37 a.m. on May 28, 1975, former FBI employee

Daniel M. (Mac) Armstrong, III, telephonically advised me that he has received

information that the Senate Select Committee may contact him for purpose of

interview. He requested my advice as to what his response should be. I

told Mr. Armstrong that he should be aware of any secrecy agreements

he may have signed while an employee of the FBI and he should be aware of

the Attorney General Order 501-73. I told him the Director was interested

in being as candid as possible with the Committee and that we would be

willing to release him from his agreement to the extent it would be possible

to do so consistent with the needs of on-going investigations and the sensitivity

of the particular information, involved. I told him thatshould he receive a

request for interview or subpoena, it would be appropriate for him to inquire

as to the general areas of discussion proposed for the interview and to (

request the Director to release him from the secrecy agreement concerning

those areas.

The Senate Select Committee has exprosed an urgent

interest in the details of any FBI investigation conceming the

Colorado, Boulder, Colorado,

disappearance of Thomas Riha'in March, 1969.

former Professor at University of

The Bureau con-

ducted no investigation regarding the

• disappearance.

There was

considerable publicity with reference to a statement made by

DI. Smiley, then President of the university, that he had been

informed by a Government official that Riha

"was alive and well"

Smiley was interviewed by the El Paso Office.

Smiley furnished

information in the strictest of confidence, not to be dissemin-

ated to any outside agency, regarding his contacts with a CIA

representative in Boulder after the Riha disappearance.

It waS

the CIA official who told him that Riha was alive and well.

Without the Smiley interview our response to the Senate Select

Committee has an obvious gap.

If the Committee calls any wit-

nesses in the Riha matter Di.. Smiley would be one of the most

logical persons to call.

The passage of time and other factors

may

have brought about a change in the mind of Di. Smiley

regarding, the necessity to keer

the information fumishes

in a confidential relationship with the Bureau and it

believed he should be given the opportunity to either

his request for confidentiality or release the Bureau

Re: Interview of Retired Special Agent (SA)

by Senator Walter F. Mondale and

Staff liembers of the Sonate Select

Committee (SSC)

Following being advised of his rights, Devlin

was asked who sont him to Atlantic City and why he was sent.

#c advised ho received his instructions from Special Agent in

Charge Ralph Bachman through Devlin's supervisor, SA Vincent

Murphy. It is to be noted here that upon being interviowed by

Epotein on April 25, 1975, Devlin had indicated

he had received

his instructions through his supervisor, SA William Gagnon.

Devlin corrected this mistake during the interview of llay 19,

1975.

As to why he was sent, Dovlin advised that as a sound

man of the Horark Office he was sent to Atlantic City,

Pol Jersey, to install a technical surveillance on fartin luther

Kinda Test who occupied a room at the Clariage totel in that

Dovlin was asked hother the monitoring plant for the

electronic surveillance vas locaced in the same hotel. upon

being advised it was the interviewers' desire to know whether

the locacion of the plant at the Claridge Hotel vas also designea

to serve as a physical lookout on King's room, Davlin advisca

he was not aware that the FBI employed a physical lool:out on

King's hotel room.

Devlin was also asked whether he installed

a microphone in the room of King. He advised that ho had not

because it vas not technically feasible.

Also or concern to

chose interviewing Devlin on May 19, was whether he had personal

knowledge as to whether the Actorney Caneral had approved the

clectronic surveillance on King's telephone.

Devlin soplied he

had no personal knowledge but assumed such authority had been

obtained by his supervisor. Devlin was also asked if he could

recall any conversations over Ring's phone which were monitored.

Dovlin soplied that the only recollection he had involved con

versationg betwoon ring and his wife wheroin they discussed

her plans to travol to Atlantic City.

Additionally, he did

recall conversations involving the noted entertainor, Mchalia

Jackson, who was appearing at that time in Atlantic City.

Davlin could not recall the substance of the conversation with

Jackson. Ho was also asked whother he retained or possessod any

Committee (SSC)

notes regarding the activity that occurred in Atlantic City during

the Democratic Party Nominating Convention during the summer of

1964.

Devlin advised that he did not retain any notes but sub-

seguent to the original contact of him by Epstein, Devlin called

sA John Connelly of the rBI Office in Newark in an effort to

review any available material that might refresh his recollection.

Connelly advised Devlin that all materials and notes retained by

the Newark Office were forwarded to FBI Headquarters.

This infor

mation was conveyed to the interviewers on the occasion of the

May 19, 1975, interview.

Devlin also was asked if he ever questioned the tech-

nical coverage of King inasmuch as it appeared to be for

political rather than security reasons.

Devlin replied that he

had no reason to question the technical coverage of King.

Fle

also was asked if he personally met with Mr. Cartha DeLoach of

the FBI while both vere in Atlantic City. Devlin advised he

could not recall whether he actually met

Deloach, pointing out

that SA Billie D. Williams was assigned the liaison responsibility

with Doloach.

Devlin was asked whether he had contacted the FBI

following his original interview by Epstein on April 25,

1975.

Devlin advised he had reported the interview by

Epstein to the FBI Office in Newark, New Jersey.

He further

advised that subsequent to this, he received a call from Newark

Assistant Special Agent in Charge Herbert Clough who informed

him that should he be contacted in the future, and should he

feel he needed to consult with FBI officials,

he could call the

Legal Counsel Division, FBI Headquarters, in Washington, D. C.,

collect,

for

such consultation.

Senator Mondale desired to linow

who Devlin saw upon his arrival in Washington, D. C., on the

morning of May 19, 1975, and specifically what instructions he

received from the FBI.

Devlin advised Senator Mondale that

A further need has now arisen for the same kind of

arrangement for the House Select Committee on Intelligence.

Again I would be very grateful to you and Mr. Murphy if a

similar arrangement could be made. for the members of the

House Committee and members of the Committee staff

advising of the receipt of a letter from the Senate Select

Committee (SSC) to the Attorney General dated 5/14/75, appending

requests for additional documents and other information.

Specific attention is invited to Appendix A, item

number 5, which requests:

"All Memoranda of the FBI and the Justice Department

discussing the legal authority of the FBI to use the following

techniques to (1) investigate internal security matters, (2)

collect intelligence information, and (3) engage in counter-

intelligence activities (see letter from the Chief Counsel to

a. All forms of electronic surveillance, including

consensual electronic surveillance;

b. All forms of mail surveillance, including mail

covers and opening mail INFORMATION CONTAINED

d. All forms of physical surveillance, including

agent infiltration; observation, photography,

and remote viewing and sensing devices;

e. Informants, including possible entrapment, provo-

cation, interference with lawyer-client relation-

It would appear appropriate that response to Appendix

COPY RETAINED IN

BERSONNEL RECORDS UNIE

At approximately 9:00 a.m. on May 21, 1975, retired

Special Agent Alan G. Sentinella appeared in my office prior to

his appointment to receive a subpoena and to testify at 9:30 a.m. on 5/21/75

at Washington, D.C., before the Senate Select Committee. I told

Mr. Sentinella that it would not be possible for me to furnish him personal

counsel prior to or during his testimony, however I felt it was appropriate

for me to furnish him certain information. I told Mr. Sentinella that he

was entitled to be represented by a personal counsel of his own choice

at any time and that if he chose to secure the services of a private attorney

he was at liberty to do so.

I also told Mr. Sentinella that under the rules of the Senate

Select Committee (Rule 6.4), a witness may be accompanied by counsel

during testimony and a witness who is unable to obtain counsel may

inform the Committee of that fact and the Committee is obliged to endeavor

to obtain voluntary counsel for the witness. I told him that the rules

further provide that the failure to obtain counsel would not excuse him from

appearing and testifying.

I asked Mr. Sentinella whether he had been given any advice

by the Committee concerning his right to counsel and whether he had received

a copy of the Committee's rules as required by regulations in the rules

(Rule 6.1). Mr. Sentinella said that he had not been so advised and he had

not been given a copy of the rules by any representative of the Committee.

I told Mr. Sentinella that as to matters other than the presence

of personal counsel, no understanding had been reached with the Committee.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: Senate Select Committee

I further explained to him that the Attorney General Order relating to

responses to subpoenas would apply to him and that we had been advised

that the Department had approved a waiver of the Attorney General Order

limitation permitting his testimony, but only as to matters concerning

Martin Luther King, Jr., and Stanley David Levison, and the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference, including related matters. Itold

Mr. Sentinella that should the questioning involve other areas and he was

in doubt as to his authorization to respond, he could request an opportunity to

consult with the Department to secure approval for his testimony consisten

with the terms of the Attorney General Order.

I also reminded Mr. Sentinelle

that a representative of the FBI would be available during his testimony

for such consultation as he felt might be necessary. I told him that

SA Paul Daly would be available for that purpose.

I told Mr. Sentinella that our concern is not that matters of

historical fact might be revealed, but that testimony which might be

required of him could impair the Bureau's current efforts to discharge its

responsibilities. I explained that in specific terms what this meant was that

information that would identify sensitive sources, techniques or methods,

or that would identify confidential informants, or would expose current

investigative operations should be reserved for members of the Committee

or perhaps the Chairman of the Committee depending upon the sensitivity

of the particular information. I advised him that in the event such matters

are involved in the questioning he could request consultation and that

arrangements could be made for the answers to be supplied under appropriately

limited conditions. I told Mr. Sentinella that as to other areas of possible

testimony, the Bureau would impose no request that he decline to answer

questions.

Mr. Sentinella advised me that he understood the matters I

had explained to him and that he did not at this time feel the need of personal

counsel because he said that he did not regard the appearance as one in the

nature of a grand jury appearance. I told Mr. Sentinella that he should

be aware that his testimony would be given under oath and in the event

he made a statement that was self-incriminatory, it could be used against

him. I reminded him I was not advising him in order to deter him from

furnishing testimony, but only telling him of the protections he has under the

Executive Order 10450

DATE:

NOV.1: 1974

20200 pony

This is in response to: your memoranda, entitled as above,

dated May 8, 1974 and August 19, 1974, directed to the Deputy

Attorney. General, Criminal Division, and referring to pro-

blems which have

arisen as a result of the promulgation of

Executive Order 11785 which amends Executive Order 10450. In

view of the involvement of my staff in these matters, I will

undertake to answer your questions with the concurrence of the

Criminal Division.

-..

As you know this matter has been under continuing review

both in the Task Force, chaired by a representative of this

office, of working level representatives of various agencies

in the security field and is now under study to a lesser degree

in Project #l0 of the

"Domestic Council on Privacy".

You ask that the Department; (a) provide specific instruc-

tions to the Bureau to conduct intelligence-type investigations

• to identify and determine the activities of organizations now

described in the amended Section 8(a) (5) of Executive Osder

10450; (b) furnish guidelines to be used by the Bureau in ini-

tiating investigations of individuals under the captioned matter

pursuant to Executive Order 10450 and specifically, criteria to

be utilized in determining whether available information is a

sufficient basis for investigation.

Under the amendment to Section 8(a) (5) of Executive Order

20450, we now have only two types of organizations; (1) those

which unlawfully advocate or practice the commission of acts

of force or violence to prevent others from exercising their

rights under the constitution or laws of the United States of

DocId: 32989588 Page 190

---

## Page 191

any State, (2) or which scek to overthrow the Government of

the Unitca States, or any State or subdivision thereof, by

unlawful mcans:

(Emphasis added) •

Of course, the key words which are underlined indicate

that the investigation should be initially based on a possiole

violation of a federal (such as the Smith Act) or state statute

prohibiting unlawful advocacy or the commission of any unlawful

act of force or violence. However, in order for the Bureau to

detect organizations with a potential of the above nature, it

Is important that tie investigation proceed on the basis of in

formation indicating tnai the organization may be of the nazure

mentioned. It is not necessary that a crime occur before the

investigation is initiated, but. only that a reasonable evaluation

of the available information suggests that the activities of the

organization may fall within the proscription of the Order. The

most recent example of the type of organization, 'that you have

advised is becoming more prevalent, is the small but dedicated

to violence, symbionese Liberation Army (SIA). Organizations. of

this nature would ciearly tall within the Order and should be

investigated as soon as information is available indicating their

potentiality for violence and of course, if possible, prior to

the fulfillment of their purposes.

It is true that Executive Order 11785 eliminated the prior

communist, totalitarian, fascist, and subversive characterizations

and definitions, but there was no intention of restricting the

investigations of such organizations if their programs call for

acts of force or violence or the unlawful advocacy of the com-

mission of acts of force or violence in furtherance of these

programs.

It is not possible to set definite parameters covering the

initiation of investigations of potential organizations falling

within the Order but once the investigation reaches a stage that

offers a basis for determining that the activities are legal in

nature, then the investigation should cease, but if the investi-

gation suggests a determination that the organization is engaged

in illegal activities or potentially illegal activities it should

continue.

' It follows in answer to your second question that indivia-

uals who are active either as members of or as affiliates of

-

2

HN 55168 DooId:32989588 Page 191

---

## Page 192

zations described above should be investigated when

mation is received indicating their involvement. The

yardstick indicated above for organizations in deter-

ing whicther the investigation should continue, should apply

incerning individuals and when a determination can reasonably

e made that the individuals activities, either within the

organization or as an individual, do not appear to be in vio-

lation of any law, then the investigation should cease.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES *

On 5-22-75 CIA requested from the FBI copies of

photographs of three 'bums" who were taken into custody by Dallas

authorities on 11-22-63 in the vicinity of the Texas School Book

Depository. It has been alleged that the three persons shown in the

photographs were E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis, individuals

involved in the Watergate incident, and Thomas Arthur Vallee, who

was arrested in Chicago, Illinois, several days before the Kennedy

assassination based on a threat against the President.

Don Donahue,

Special Assistant to Senator Henry Jackson (D-Wash.), made available

on 9-12-74 to Inspector Bowers a set of the photographs depicting these

"bums" which had been furnished to Donahue by one Michael Canfield,

and the F'BI Laboratory made copies from these prints, the original

being returned to Donahue. Donahue requested that his identity be ,

concealed as the source of these photographs. Canfield was supposed to

furnish a set of these photographs to Washington Field Office but it has

been determined he never did so.

At Mr. Adams' instructions, Bowers contacted Donahue

on 5-22-75 and advised him of the CIA request for a set of these photographs.

Donahue was told that if he has no objections we intend to furnish CIA a

set of the pictures with the statement that the originals were obtained from

an individual who requested his identity be concealed. Donahue stated that

was quite satisfactory to him, adding that if it becomes necessary he

Would

agree to his identity being disclosed as the source of these pictures.

K. William O'Conner, Deputy Assistant Attorney

General, Civil Rights Division, who has recently been designated by

the Attorney General to coordinate all responses by the Department

to the Senate Select Committee(SSC), advised on the afternon of 5-19-75

that he had met with Chief Counsel to the SSC F. A. O. Schwarz and John

Ellitt, who is the head of the task force of the Senate Select Committee

on the FBI. O'Conner stated he informed Schwarz and Elliff that he would

not make available Bureau secretaries Mary Ann Massa and M. Ann

Mierzejewski, who are scheduled for interview on Tuesday, 5-20-75,

absent an agreement by the Committee that an FBI representative would

be allowed to be present during the interview. O'Conner indicated that

the Department's stand in this matter regarding the insistence that FBI

representatives be present during the interview was backed by the White

House, the Attorney General, and the Deputy Attorney General.

By way of background, it should be noted that Mr. O'Conner

and Associate Deputy Attorney General McDermott were contacted on

5-14-75, and advised of the requested interview of the two aforementioned

employees at which time O'Conner and McDermott did not advise of any

way in which the employees could be prevented from consenting to interview.

While they were upset at the prospect of service personnel, such as steno-

graphers being interviewed by the Committee, they indicated at that time

they could not see any legal leverage which could be used to preclude

such interviews. With this decision in mind arrangements were made

to make these employees

available IoK

merview.

62-116395-

Schwarz told O'Conner he would have to check with the

SSC prior to agreeing to allow FBI representatives to be present. O'Conner

stated Schwarz was quite upset at the Department's stance in this matter,

but indicated he would give O'Conner an answer this evening. O'Conner

indicated to sche 20th Sath the Bureat empo e, he a see lable for

representatives during the interview.

position concerning the presence of FBI representatives during the interview

of the two secretaries is unchanged: O'Conner related that he told Schwarz

that Departmental position is also unchanged in that there will be no

interview unless the Committee relents on this position. O'Conner indicated

he would keep the Bureau advised and requested that we continue with our

plans to have the secretaries available for interview as Schwarz indicated

he would again contact O'Conner regarding this issue.

which attached a copy of a letter to the Attorney General

dated 5/14/75, from Senator Frank Church, Chairman,

United States Senate Select Committee (SSC) with appendices

A thru D.

The memorandum noted the ambiguous nature of some

of the SSC requests and that Mr. K. William O'Conner, Deputy

Assistant Attorney General, who is the Department of Justice

coordinator for SSC matters, is presently negotiating the 5/14/75

requests with the SSC Staff.

Even though the negotiations are still under way, we

believe that ultimately we will be required to provide substantial

responses to the 5/14/75 requests.

to gather together the necessary data from our files in anticipa-

tion of the substantial responses we will be required to prepare.

The various requests set forth in the May 14, letter have been

analyzed and specific assignments made to prepare responses.

primary assignments have been made to representatives of several

Sections of the INTD. It is anticipated that in some circumstances

it will be necessary for these INTD representatives to convey

requests for information and material to other Divisions.

When

such action is necessary contact will be effected through the

designated representatives of the other Headquarters Divisions.

A list of such other Divisional representatives is maintained

by the SENSTUDY Staff on the basis of designations made to assist

in previous SSC requests, and is set forth below.

On 5/21/75, Andy Smith, Supervisor in our

Birmingham Office, called Deputy Assistant Director Herington

and advised that former SA Robert R. Nichols (EOD: 1/6/47;

retired: 5/12/72) had been contacted by the Senate Select Committee

for interview. Smith connected Nichols through to Herington, at which

time Nichols advised that about ten days ago Lester Seidel of the Senate

Select Committee had contacted him. At that time, Nichols was going

to Oklahoma City, and has just recently returned home to Birmingham.

Nichols stated that at one time he was the case agent in the Atlanta

Office on the Martin Luther King investigation, and it was presumed 5

this was the subject matter of the proposed interview.

Nichols was advised that the decision as to whether he

would consent to interview was entirely his to make. He was reminded

that he had signed a secrecy agreement, and was reminded of the provisions

of AG Order 501-73 requiring prior authority from the appropriate Depart-

mental official prior to a current or former employee furnishing information

he acquired during the course of his employment.

He was also advised

that he had a right to be represented by a personal attorney if he desired

and that he had all the constitutional rights available to him, the same as

any citizen. He was further told that it he desired to have an fB

representative available, but not present during the interview he could

so request, noting that the purpose of the FBI representative would be to

counsel him concerning sensitive areas which might be exploted.

JUN 3 1975

It was emphasized to Nichols that the FBI wo uld not and

could not recommend the course of action he should take and that the

decision with regard to this interview was entirely his to make.

12501 SALI

Dear Mr. Seidel:

Reference is made to your telephone call to me on May 16,

1975, In which you advisod that the Committee was gachering

facts concerning the FBI's various CoIntelPros and in

particular, you were looking into the CoIntelPro having

to do with the Black Panthers.

You inquired if I recalled a

letter, which had been made public, dated May 11, 1970, from

the Director, FBI, to the SAC, San Erancisco, which suggested

disruptive techniques against the Black Panthers and which

mentioned spurious police or FBI reports.

I advised you I

had no first hand recollection of having seen such a document

at that tine, buc that I had read a recent neus iren describ

ing

such a document.

You also indicated an interest in the theoretical question as

to whothor intelligence functions should be divorced from

enforcoment functions in order to avoid the dilemma of dis

closure versus dismissal, and you suggested that my views on

this might be helpful in educating the Cormittee.

For your information, I entered on duty as a Special Agent on

January 5, 1942, and retired from the Bureau on December 3,

1971.

During the two years immediately preceding my retirement

I served as supervisor of a squad of agents which investigated,

among other matters, violations and alleged violations of law

by the Black Panthers.

The only information I have concerning

the Black Panthers was learned as a direct result of my official

duties.

I have made no independent study of them, nor do I

have any personal files or written material, either official

or otherwise, relating to them.

Since speaking with you, I have revicwed Executive Order $501-73

(28 C.F.R.SS 16.21, 16.22 and 16.23) which specifies that no

employee or former employee of the Department of Justice shall

produce any material contained in the files of the Department

nor shall he disclose any information acquired in the performance

of his official duties vithout prior approval of the Attorney

This memorandum reports the results of a

Staff and Bureau officials at Quantico, Virginia, on the eveningo

of 5/5/75.,

On 5/5/75 Mr. John Elliff, who heads the task force of

the SSC looking into the FBI, met with officials of the Bureau at

Quantico. Elliff was accompanied by Mark/Gitenstein and Mary

Debreo.

FBI officials present were Assistant Director W. R.

Wannall, Inspectors Thomas W. Leavitt, Hunter E. Helgeson, and

John B. Hotis as well as Section Chief William O. Cregar.

At the outset of the meeting, Mr. Elliff provided the

Bureau representatives with a memorandum the subject of which was!

entitled "Intelligence Division Position Paper on Jurisdiction,"

dated 2/13/75, copy of which is attached. Elliff's memorandum

contained a series of questions along with the rationale for these

questions which provided the basis for the Quantico meeting. We

are not considering these questions a formal request from the

Select Committee. Mr. Elliff and the Staff of the Select Committee

are aware that formal responses that the Bureau might be expected to

provide the Committee can only be predicated on written requests

to the Attorney General (AG) from Senator Frank Church or the

Committee's Chief Counsel.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall.

RE:

SENSTUDY 75

62-116395

By memorandum dated 5/6/75, we advised the AG that

the requested position paper of 7/31/72 is an internal deliberative

document which we feel

is inappropriate to furnish the Select

Committee. This position is consistent with the position previously

expressed by the AG.

This positioning

During the meeting with Elliff he was orally

advised of the Bureau's position regarding making the 7/31/72

position paper available to the Select Committee.

The Appendices which have not yet been made available

to the Select Committee are being cleared with other agencies

under the Third Agency rule requirement and will be made available

to the Select Committee once all clearances have been obtained.

Elliff was orally apprised of this.

During the course of the meeting, Mr. Elliff stated

that he felt the FBI's concerted investigative effort in the

early 1960s against the Klan and later our investigative effort

arising out of the ghetto riots were justified given the situation

at that time. However, he felt the Committee would probably

like to do an in-depth case study of both investigations. He

asked if the FBI could provide the Committee with copies of all

memoranda and documents reflecting the decision making process

leading up to the initiation of the major investigative effort

against the Klan as well as investigations during and following

the ghetto riots. Elliff

was advised that we certainly would

consider responding following receiptoof a formal written request

from Senator Church through the AG. Elliff advised he would

prepare such a written request.

The Intélligence Division has already instituted the

necessary research in anticipation of this request and will submit

recommendations following a completion of this research.

In anticipation of Select Committee hearings which are

expected to begin in about one month, Mr. Elliff and Gitenstein

expect to start interviews of current Bureau employees in Bureau

space during the week of 5/19/75. Mr. Gitenstein will concentrate

on the work of the Internal Security Branch of the Intelligence

Division and Mr. Elliff on the Counterintelligence Branch. We

expect that Mr. Elliff will begin his interviews by meeting with

Assistant Director Wannall, Inspector Leavitt and the Section

Chiefs of the Counterintelligence Branch.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

RE: SENSTUDY 75

62-116395

It is noted that we previously furnished to the

Select

Committee with the AG's approval one copy each.of

Sections 87 and 122 of the Manual of Instructions. Section 87

is concerned with investigations of

subversive organizations

and individuals. Section 122 addresses.

extremist matters and

civil unrest. In his discussion of these two Sections it was

readily apparent Mr. Gitenstein had conducted a thorough review.

In this regard, he noted a difference in the investigative procedure

outlined in these two Sections of the Manual. Mr. Gitenstein

was advised that the. Intelligence Division had just completed

a Manual revision combining these two Sections into one and had

submitted it to the Director for his approval. Mr. Gitenstein

commented this was an excellent idea to combine these two Sections

into one and expressed the hope that the revised section could

be made available to the Committee for its review in anticipation

of the forthcoming Committee hearings.,

At the conclusion of the meeting, Elliff asked whether

the FBI would be willing to meet with the Staff to discuss such

sensitive issues as surreptitious entry, the opening of mail, and

incommunicado interviews. Elliff was advised that the Bureau was

aware of certain allegations that have appeared in the press and

felt that any interviews in sensitive areas should be restricted

to the Senators on the Committee. Elliff interposed no objection

to this suggestion.

The thrust of the meeting gave Bureau officials present

the impression that the task force was primarily concerned with

identifying what areas of the Bureau's investigative responsi-

bilities needed to be better defined through new legislation.

In fact, Elliff solicited the observations of those present as

to what

the. Bureau's needs were in the way of new legislation

to permit the Bureau to carry out its internal security responsi-

bilities effectively. He recognized certain limitations involving

records of educational institutions, banking institutions, telephone

companies and credit establishments currently restrict the Bureau

and suggest that some legislation with Congressional oversight

should be written to assist the FBI in carrying out its mission.

Net!ORANDUM

From: John Blliff

Subject: "Intelligence Division Position Paper on Jurisdiction"

dated February 13, 1975

1. The following documents directly related to this Position

Paper have not been supplied to the Select Committee:

(I) The previous Position Paper, dated July 31, 1972.

(2) Appendices I, J, K, M, and P.

2. Parts I and II discuss the Presidential directives which

may serve as the basis for FBI national security intelligence

activities. Part IV lists statutes. and Executive Orders

affecting FBI jurisdiction.

There is no mention in Parts I and

II of the first Executive Order cited in Part IV. This is

Executive Order #11605, dated July 2, 1971, amending Executive

Orcer #10450, of April 27, 1953, relating to security require-

ments for careramant enpicyncat.

These Executive Orders have been further amended by

a more recent Executive Order of June 4, 1974. This latest

order abolishéd the so-called "Attorney General's List" and

revised the criteria for determining the suitability and

loyalty of Government employees.

The following questions arise:

(1) In what way, if any, do the Executive Orders

relating to employment security provide a legal

basis for FBI intelligence activities?

(?) In what way, if any, did the Executive Order of

June 4, 1974, affect the legal basis for FBI

intelligence activities?

3. The analysis in Parts I and II discusses the legal basis

for FBI national security intelligence investigations. There

is no specific discussion of other intelligence activities.

These other activities are variously described in the attached

documents and quoted memoranda.

The terms used include

"counterespionage" (Presidential Directive of June 26, 1939),

"to neutralize Communist front and Communist-dominated organi-

zations of the United States" (IIC and ICIS Report to NSC,

March 5, 1954), "program designed to intensify any confusion and

dissatisfaction among its Communist Party's7 members" and

"counterintelligence operations" (NSC Briefing, November 6, 1958).

"action proposals to protect the internal security of the United

States" (National Security Action Memorandum 161, June 9, 1962).

The term "counterespionage" reappears in several other documents.

These terms seem to refer to activities which have since

been labeled COINTELPRO operations. In this regard, it should

be noted that Attorney General Saxbe's report of November 18,

1974 On FBI COINTELPRO Activities stated, at p. 20:

"(2) Espionage or Soviet-Satellite Intelligence

This program, although officially designated

a COINTELPRO program, emphasized intelligence gathering

and counterintelligence efforts already being pursued

in connection with the Bureau's ongoing foreign intelli-

gence responsibilities. It did not curtail any activity

or in any way change the scope of counterintelligence

efforts already in effect and continuing today. It was

primarily intended to inspire initiative and to encourage

ingenuity in the Bureau's continuing counterintelligence

efforts against hostile foreign intelligence services."

.. In the interest of the national security, no

statistics or examples of the types of actions imple

'mented under this program may appropriately be disclosed."

This passage seems to say that the FBI continues to perform

other activities going beyond investigation and directed at

hostile foreign intelligence services.

The following questions

arise:

(1) In what way, if any, do the Presidential directives

discussed in Parts I

and II provide a legal basis

for FBI national security intelligence activities

beyond investigations?

(2) In what way, if any, do the Presidential directives

discussed in Parts I

and II provide a legal basis

for

the COINTELPRO activities which have been

discontinued

as a matter of policy since 1971?

In what way, if any, do the Presidential directives

discussed in Parts I and II provide a legal basis

for the FBI's continuing counterintelligence efforts

against hostile foreign intelligence services?

4. Appendix S includes excerpts from the appropriations testimony

Of former Director Hoover. The testimony in 1939 and 1941 makes

reference to President Roosevelt's Proclamation of National

Emergency, September 8, 1939. The following exchange took place

-at-the hearing on February 19, 1941:

Mr. Ludlow. At the close of the present emergency, when

peace comes, it would mean that much of this emergency

work necessarily will be discontinued.

Mr. Hoover. That is correct. •

Mr. Taber:. Is your set-up for the national-defense work

separate from the other work?

Mr. Hoover. It is.

Mão Taici.

Is it uporated as a soparuto division? -

Mr. Hoover. Yes.

In the field our field officials

are under instructions to utilize approximately 50

percent of the personnel on national defense work

and the other 50 percent on the regular work.

Mr. Taber.

But if some rush comes up, you might have

to vary that?

Mr. Hoover. That is correct.

Mr. Taber. According to the situation.

?..:

Mr. Hoover. According to the emergency that might arise.

If the national emergency should terminate, the

structure dealing with national defense can immediately

be discontinued or very materially curtailed according

to the wishes of Congress.

When President Roosevelt issued the Proclamation of National

Emergency on Séptember 8, 1939, he accompanied it with Executive

order No. 8247 directing

the Attorney General to "increase the

personnel of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of

Justice, in: such number, not exceeding 150, as he shall find

necessary for the proper performance of the additional duties

imposed upon the Department of Justice in connection with the

national emergency." At a press conference the same day,

HH 55168 DooId:32989588 Page 236

---

## Page 237

-4-

President Rooseveit

specifically discussed this Executive

Order and the nature of the "additional duties imposed upon

the Department of Justice."

"And the fourth Executive Order? relates to what

you might say is a combination of neutrality and national

defense. It provides for an addition to the personnel

of certain investigating agencies of the Government to

protect this country against--I suppose the easiest way

of putting it is--some of the episodes, some of the

things that happened over here in 1914

and 1915 and

1916 and the beginning of 1917, before we got into the

war. There was, sabotage; there was a great deal of

propaganda by both belligerents, and a good many definite

plans laid in this country by foreign governments to try

to sway American public opinion. We do not have to

specify. . The older men who are here can remember some

of the episodes of that time. It is to guard against

that, and against the spread by any foreign nation of

propayanda in this country which wouia tenã to se

subversive--I believe that is the word--of our form of

Government." (1939 Roosevelt Papers 485-486)

The following questions arise:

(1) To what extent, if any, were the Presidential.

directives of June 26, 1939 and September 6, 1939,

based on the emergency powers of the President?

(2) To what extent, if any, was the establishment of

the FBI's Intelligence Division in September, 1939,

based on the President's Proclamation of National

Emergency and Executive Order No. 8247?

(3). To what extent, if any, does Congress have the

Constitutional authority to discontinue or curtail

the FBI's national security intelligence activities

based on the President's emergency powers or on

other Constitutional powers of the Executive Branch?

At approximately 3:20 PM, former SA David E. Todd

(EOD as SA 1/5/42; retirement 12/9/71) called long distance from

San Francisco and spoke to Deputy Assistant Director Herington.

He said that he had been contacted by Lester B. Seidel, Senate Select

Committee, who said that he would be on the west coast in the near

future and desired to interview Todd concerning FBI policies with

regard to investigation of racial matters and our counterintelligence

programs against the Black Panthers and other groups. Todd pointed

out that he was a former supervisor of the San Francisco Office desk

responsible for Black Panther cases. Todd asked what position he

should take. He was advised that his decision as to whether or not to

be interviewed was entirely his and that the Bureau could not make

any suggestion in this regard. It was pointed out that if he decided to

be interviewed, we had made arrangements with the Senate Select.

Committee which would permit a Bureau representative to be available

for consultation with regard to matters that might seem sensitive, but

that the Bureau representative would not be present during or participate

in the actual interview. He was advised further that he had the same

rights as any other citizen, namely, the right to personal counsel and

any other rights guaranteed him under the Constitution.

Pursuant to

his request, he was also advised of the provisions of Attorney General

Order 501-73 which appears in Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations,

beginning at Section 16.21, which would require appropriate Departmental

approval prior to any current or former employee revealing, pursuant to

a subpoena or other demand, any information acquired during the course

of the employee's official duties.

He was also reminded that all Bureau

employees had signed a secrecy agreement. 62 - 11L295-15

Re: SENSTUDY 75

Todd indicated that while he desired to respond as legally

required to an official committee inquiry, he would advise Mr. Seidel

that he considered himself bound by the Attorney General Order and did

not feel that he could reveal official information without approval by the

appropriate Department official.

Todd was clearly advised that this

decision had to be his own and that the FBI could not and would not make

any recommendation to him as to the course of action he should take.

This is to advise that as of 5-7-75 we have received

and ordered to the field a total of 96 requests from the SSC for

investigations of its staff members. An additional case was

received on 5-8-75 which is being ordered to the field immediately.

As a result of referenced memo, Inspector Bowers contacted the

SSC which was in accord with a

remaining investigations, except "a few" specials which wold

At about 1 p.m., 5/2/75, ASAC Herbert D. Clough,

Newark Division, called to furnish the following information:

The Newark Office had just been contacted by former

Bureau Supervisor Dan Brennan, retired, who resides at Sea Girt,

New Jersey. Brennan advised that he had been contacted earlier

today by Mike Epstein of the Senate Select Committee who

desired to talk to Brennan today and an appointment was set up.

Epstein was to arrive at Newark around noon and then drive to

Sea Girt, about an hour's travel. Based on information furnished

at the recent conference in New York, Newark had dispatched an

Agent to be present during this interview as requested by Dan Brennan,

After completing my conversation with Clough, I discussed

this matter with John Hotis, Office of Legal Counsel, and it was

concluded the Agent from Newark who would be present during

the interview should call Office of Legal Counsel, speak to Hotis,

and obtain general guidelines for his participation in this interview.

ASAC Clough was recontacted and so instructed. I also

ISSUE PAPER ON INTELLICENCE FILES AND PRIVACY

The Executive Committee of the Ad Hoc Co-

ordinating Group on Congressional Review of the Intel-

ligence Community identified ten issues likely to grow

out of the Select Committee's deliberations.

The

Executive Committee asked the FBI to prepare a paper

on one of these topics, Intelligence Files and Privacy.

Specifically, the request was for a brief paper which

raises the issues observed by the intelligence agencies

when intelligence files and privacy are viewed together

without, suggesting or recommending how the questions

should be resolved.

J. D. Miller drafted an outline which was

discussed on April 16, 1975, with representatives of the

CIA and Departments of Defense and Treasury.

On April 21,

this outline was presented by Mr. Hotis to the Executive

Committee which received it without comment. Mr. Miller

then prepared a rough draft which was discussed at a

meeting on April 22, with the representatives of the CIA

and Department of Treasury.

Mr. Miller's final draft is attached. It

discusses both intelligence files and the concept of

privacy in general terms before focusing on the issues

which present themselves when an effort is made to

establish the proper relationship between the two.

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

Last week's issue of Newsweek, on page 15,

states:

Hoover's Secrets

Following the death last week of Clyde

Tolson, J. Edgar Hoover's close friend and No.

man at the FBI, two FBI agents reportedly

removed some documents from the late director's

house in Washington, where Tolson had been liv-

ing. Officially, the FBI denies taking any

such action, and

a friend of Tolson's says the

only Hoover

documents Tolson had were old can-

celed checks and tax returns.

But Newsweek had

reported earlier that some of Hoover's

left in Tolson's custody, and a source

told Newsweek this week that

the materials were

carted away in a truck.

Assuming that the files in question may be part

of the so-called

"Official and Confidential" files, your

cestimony before the House Judiciary Committee on Februar

27, 1975, is instructive. You said that the number of

files which you reviewed

contained matters relating to

, "intelligence activities by hostile nations"

"domestic extremist activities"

, and use of the FBI to

gather political intelligence.

Furthermore, at the same time, Director Kelley

suggested that materials from the "Official and Confiden-

tial" files were taken to Director Hoover's home. He

stated:

Immediately after his death Mr. Hoover's/

some of his employees, including his personal

secretary, went through his files and completed

the destruction of the remainder of the files

that were purely personal.

These were destroyed

by shredding.

Some I understand were taken out

co his home and placed in his home, they being

nistorical I presume to some extent. There is

no indication that they were other than personal

files.

Please determine for the Select Committee whether

¡ any documents were removed from Mr. Tolson's or Mr. Hoover's

residence by FBI agents or former

FBI agents after

Mr. Tolson's death.

If agents of the FBI did go to

Mr. Hoover's or Mr. Tolson's residence to remove files,

please provide the

Select Committee with a complete des-

cription of the documents taken into custody by the FBI.

Were any such documents copies or originals of documents

relating to the business of the FBI?

LI so, please des-

cribe the subject matter of each such document. Also

indicate the individual within the FBI who has

custody

over these files. Furthermore, I respectfully request on

behalf of the Select Committee

that such files

not be des-

troyed or removed from the FBI's custody until

further

notice.

CLYDE A. TOLSON

FORMER ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR

The April 28, 1975, issue of "Newsweek" magazine

on page 15 under its "Periscope" section, referred to Mr.

Tolson's death and claimed that 2 Agents reportedly removed

documents from Hoover's residence where Tolson had been

living. The article, captioned "Hoover's Secrets," carried

the FBI's denial of such action and also stated that a friend

of Tolson's said the only Hoover documents Tolson had were

and tax returns.

added that "Newsweek" had reported earlier that some of Hoover's

private dossiers, including information "very, very damaging"

to persons in the Nixon White House, were left in Tolson's

custody.

"Newsweek" further claimed that a source advised that

the materials were carted away 'in a truck.

Mr. Kelley has asked of Messrs. Callahan, Jenkins,

Adams and Moore, "Do you have any idea where such a story got

started? Ky."

My memorandum to you of 4/17/75 captioned as above

(copy attached) pointed out that Tony Marro,

"Newsweek" reporter,

contacted my office that date advising he had heard from a

source to the effect that 2 Agents were sent to Tolson's residence

the day of his death with a truck and carted away some files

which were subsequently brought to the home of Mr. John P.

Mt. Mohr, Marro was advised there was absolutely no truth

to the story. It should be noted that Mr. Mohr also advised

at that time that most of the furnishings at Mr. Tolson's

home have been removed over the past several months and that

there were some associates of the family and Annie, the housekeeper

who had stopped by the house on the day of the death with

some empty boxes to help remove additional furnishings.

Director Sec'y —

By memorandum dated 4-30-75, directed to the

Deputy Attorney General and the Director of the FBI, signed by Chief

Counsel of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) Frederick A. O. Schwarz,

JI., the SSC had made additional requests of the FBI. Their requests are

divided into four separate areas which are as follows: (1) Request for

prior changes in the Manual of Instructions, to those sections of the

Manual of Instructions which they have already had access to. (2) Request

to review certain sections of the Manual of Instructions not previously

furnished the Committee. A review of this list discloses generally

these sections do not pertain to foreign or domestic intelligence investigations

and some do not appear to be within the ambit of Senate Resolution 21 which

charters the authority of the SSC. Regarding the sections of the Manual

of Instructions, the request stated they would be satisfied with reviewing

them at FBI Headquarters. (3) Request certain sections of the Manual

of Rules and Regulations be made available for review by SSC representatives :

at FBI Headquarters. As in request #2, some of the sections do not

appear to be within the scope of Senate Resolution 21. Among the sections

of the Manual of Rules and Regulations requested are such sections as those

concerning disciplinary matters and administration of offices. (4) A

general request conerning the Bureau's filing procedures including

information concerning our indexing system, list of classifications used

in FBI filing system, and a set of forms used by the Bureau. (Attached

is a copy of the memorandum.)

Legal Counsel to Adams Memorandum

RE: SENSTUDY 75

be technically accurate the Committee felt it was necessary for them

to come to a general understanding as to Bureau operations and that

this would assist them in their review of FBI operations in the domestic

and foreign intelligence areas. Gitenstein also indicated it was the

Committee's feeling that Senate Resolution 21 was intended to be construed

liberally and that in general it required that the SSC be furnished by

the various intelligence agencies that information which would be necessary

for them to carry out its mandate. It was also explained to Gitenstein

that concerning their requests involving prior changes in various sections

of the Manual of Instructions that they had not placed a cutoff date as

to how far back the Bureau had to go to comply with this request. Gitenstein

indicated that we could use 1-1-60 as the cutoff date.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) Recipients review requests pertaining to their Divisions

and furnish in memorandum form their response to the Legal Counsel

Division.

(2) The Legal Counsel Division will, upon receipt of

responses from the interested Divisions, prepare the necessary communication

to the Senate Select Committee to be approved by the Attorney General and

furnished to the Committee.

MEMORANDUM FOR DEPUTY ATTORNEY

GENERAL TYLER AND DIRECTOR KELLY

April 30, 1975

• This memorandum concerns paragraph IV of the attachment

to Senator Church's letter of March 19 to the Attorney General.

On behalf of the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental

Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, I would like to

request the following:

1. Superseded Sections of the Manual of Instructions.

Certain sections of the Manual currently in effect have been produced

tọ us. We had intended by the request to ask for the relevant super-

seded sections (note the absence of the word "current" in Section IV

as compared to Section IIIA) and we did indicate previously to the

liaison staff that

we were interested in superseded

sections. But

without regard to that, it is clear from documents such

as the

Director's letter of August 7, 1973 to the Attorney General that

certain superseded sections will be highly relevant in analyzing

Heror furnished

the question of legal authority, as well as in understanding particu-

lar events in earlier years. We would appreciate their being sent

to us promptly or if that causes mechanical problems, being able to

promptly review them at the FBI in order to select particular

portions for copying. At a minimum we would be interested in

superseded Manual provisions for the sections set out in Appendix A.

Sections of the Manual Of Instructions Not Previously

Produced. Based upon the previous production to us of the table

of contents to the Manual of Instructions, we have identified

certain additional sections of the Manual which we would like to

exanine.

Rather than having these made available to us in the

first instance in

our offices, we suggest that they be made avail-

able to Mark Gitenstéin,

and other designated members of the staff,

for initial examination at the FBI offices. A listing of those

séctions is annexed as Appendix B.

• 3.

Manual of Rules and Regulations. Again, based upon

the procedure whereby we were first furnished with the table of

contents of the Manual of Rules, we have identified those sections

which we want to examine initially. Io expedite matters, these

sections, identified in Appendix C, could be examined by Mr. Gitenstein,

or other designated staff members, at the FBI offices.

4.

Filing System. It would also be most helpful if you

could provide the Committee with any other written materials on

administration of any of the filing or information systems, manual

of automated, which are used in the course of intelligence or

internal security activities. This does not fit within our prior

request but should serve to make future requests more focused.

"I have in mind specifically any memoranda prepared by

the Bureau on its indexing system and the so-called Clerk's Manual,

if such a document exists, Please also provide the Committee with

a list of the classifications used in the FBI's filing system as well

as a complete set of printed forms used by the Bureau (e.5., FD-165,

etc.).

We believe that all the foregoing material will help

expedite and foous the inguiry. I assume that Mr. Hotis will

contact me promptly to arrange for our review of this material

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams

RE: H. R. 214

Congresswoman Bella Abzug (D-N. Y.), had indicated an interest in

holding hearings onthis matter.

Whitley stated hopefully Abzug's

Subcommittee can be precluded from conducting any hearings in this

area by virtue of the assertion of authority by the Post Office and Civil

Service Committee.

James Wentzel, Office of Legislative Affairs, Department

of Justice, has been alerted to the effect that an invitation will be received

by the Department for testimony on this legislation.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the General and Special Investigative Divisions and

the Intelligence Division promptly begin compiling appropriate information

for submission to the Legal Counsel Division which can be submitted to

the Department for its use in testifying or can be used as the basis for

FBI testimony should the Department request an FBI representative to appear

at these hearings.
