that the risk of discovery was too great, and the mission was

called off.

When they were contacted, as set out above, both pa 612-C and

PCI C

said they have noted that GABRIEL MANNARINO spends

considerably less time in New Kensington than was formerly

the case, due to the

â€¢ "continuing heat" by the Federal Govern-

ment.

They said that MANNARINO still visits the back room of

Supper Club of America in New Kensington but on an infre-

visits to occur about once each week for anywhere from a half

an hour to an hour, but he could not say if any one day was

more likely than any other.

Due to the physical problems involved,

the Pittsburgh Office

cannot be absolutely certain of security if an attempt should

be made for a misur installation at the Supper Club of America.

The site is a street-level storefront which can be entered

only through its one door in front. It is located on a very

short side street between

two of New Kensington's main thoro-

illuminate all portions of the entrance.

Surveillance has

proven that traffic passes at all hours of the night.

Because of the

awareness of the racketeering element of

"Federal heat," of the diminished frequency of MANNARINO's

visits, and of the lack of security, a misur installation will

not be

requested at the Supper Club

time. However, the Pittsburgh Office will be alert for improve-

ment in conditions at that location and will continue to attempt

that 19 10th 2o

to find another location where a feasible and productive

Installation can be made regarding GABRIEL MANNARINO.
