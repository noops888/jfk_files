Information receivediron

two former Cuban Investigators who have

recently arrived in the United States indicates that the economic situation in

Cuba-despite assistance from various soviet bloc nations-leaves much to be

desired. According to these two sources, increasing Government control over

the means of production and distribution has resulted in a shortage of food and

consumer goods, which in turn has brought on more controls' and the vicious

circle of an even greater shortage of items available to the general public. The

reaction of the people, the sources say, is a combination ef bla

acts of sabotage, and desperation flights to the United States

cie-market quint.

According to the first of these sources, the items which comprise the

basis of the Cuban daily diet are both scarce and rationed.

Part of the difficulty

in securing proper food in Cuba, the source reported, is its scarcity. The rest

is the lack of organization in its distribution. In an attempt to combat the food

shortages, the Cuban Government has instituted a rationing system.

The ration

cards are issued to the public through the Committees of Defense of the Revolution

Generally, there is one such committee for each block, and different cares are

used for different types of items.

Inferior Imports

The poor organization in the distribution of food--causing shortages

in some markets and surpluses in others--has given rise to a situation popularly

known in Cuba as Venta por la fare. Thig means the sale of a product without

Government control, or the black market, One of the answers of the castro

regime to both the shortages and the resulting black market, the sourge said, is
