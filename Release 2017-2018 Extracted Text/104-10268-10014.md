1.

The referent memorandum contains two points

which require comments.

The first point concerns

allegations that were made shortly after the assassination

The allegations are totally urfowded.

2. The facts regarding this matter are as follows:

• Mr. R.G. Roccas

checomthin the Agency at Headquarters

ised by the Agency or been connected with it in ans

conceivable way.

He ordered me to make the checks

directly and personally to the degree possible and not

to accept statements of intermediaries.

Helms, who was then the DDP and served as one of the

Agency's key contact officials with the Warren

b. Although I had already checked the Main Index

of IP (then RID) on the night of the assassination, I

rechecked the Main Index and found na record beyond

that which I had already obtained before (plus, those

items which had been integrated into the records system

since the assassination).

There was nothing in the DDo

specifying all the checks I had made and stating

that the results showed that Lee Harvey OSWALD

had never had eny connection whatsoever with the

Agency: Eventually a statement to this effect

was communicated to the Warren Commission.

• checks regarding use or employment-

of OSAID had been requested by the foreign divisions

of their appropriate stations, I was told, and the

results were negative.

4.

I recall very clearly that we were extremely

concerned at the time that OSWALD,

as an American returning

trom the Ussk, might have been routinely debriered by

DCD, thus having established contact with the Agency.

The same point has now, quite understandably, been made

by the two CBS newsmen.

Having some knowledge of this

subject I have personally concluded that there is valid

reason for DCD's lack of interest in OSWALD at that time.

He would surely have been contacted and debriefed by DCD

had he been to the USSR and returned to the US before

1957/1958.

Travel to the Soviet Union by Westerners,

particularly by Americans, before that time was quite

uncommon and we were hungry for eyewitness information in

those days.

the thaw began in about 1956 and by the end

of that decade there were so many persons travelling to

and from the Soviet Union that DCD was incapable of

ing to all of them.

talk-

Therefore, a program of selectivity

and specific target applicability was

instituted.

In

light of the above*

seems to me that OSWALD- if he

came to D@D @attention at all-would have easily been

by-passed, because he simply did not possess the type of

information that ped was seeking at that time.

DCD would

surehy have used its limited manpower on travellers who

should be added that my above-described

the Agency file holding produced no record or

that any other

US Government agency had used

a source or had considered him for recruitment.

I just want to be sure that you are satisfied that this Agency

is giving you all the help that we possibly can in connection

with your investigation of the situation in Dallas. I know

the importance the President places on this investigation

you are making. He asked me personally whether CLA was

giving you full support. I said that they were, but I just

wanted to be sure from you that you felt so.

We have had the very best support that we could possibly

expect from you.

Good. Well you can call on us for anything we have.

We will feel free to do that

I think it is an exceedingly important investigation and report

and I am delighted that the President has called on you to

make it.

We are trying to do it as fast as we can so we can dispel various

wild rumors that have been circulating as to whether this man

was the right man etc. that fired the gun. But there is no question

that he is the right man.

There are a lot of aspects that we have

dug up, for instance, with regards to the matter i Mexico City.

We have now found that the photograph that was ta en was not

that of Oswald. We do find from our informant doin there that

Oswald did call at the Embassy that day and the informant has

given us the conversation that he had.

He wanted to get a permit

to go back to Russia and the Cuban Embassy couldn't give him

the permit. The Soviet Embassy stated that it wall d take three

weeks.

He had, I think, a visitor's permit for about a week or

ten days so that is why he came back to the United States.

Well, all of that ties in importantly into the story and we have

those operational sources down there.

We want to handle them

very carefully. It involves some very high level people down

there. Sam Papich and I have talked about that a couple of times.

who is handling it for the Department-

it is our intention when the Bureau finishes the report, he will

of course go over it very carefully because it will be a report

House, but it is the intention after it is in final form to be

checked with each of the Government agencies that are mentioned

in it. State Department is involved in regard to the issuing of

the passport to the man to come back to this country and that

has got to be explained why it was done, the law requires it,

all of which of course we are gathering.

The aspects of the

Mexico City thing. It will have to be mentioned. It is his

intention to check with the agencies, Secret Service, etc. to be

sure that whatever is said in the report is conferred in and it

is agreed to by the various agencies mentioned.

So you will

have that opportunity to go over it and see exactly what is said

and I know he will welcome any suggestion that you care to make-

Well that will be fine. Thank you

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Rocca

"Internal Mama Regarding Agency's Position in Dealing

with Warren Commission

1. The DDP called me this afternoon, 12 May, to state,

that the Director has received a telephone call from RANKIN A

regarding the Commission's desire to interview him at 1030 AM)

morning.

MI. HOOVER is scheduled to appear at 9:00 on tha

2.

The DDP wishes to have from you a sh

but

comprehensive memorandum which highlights the basic issues or

positions entered into by the Agency in its dealings with the

Commission.

For example, RANKIN indicated that the Commission

would wish to hear the Dire ctor's views as to how improvements

might be made in protecting the President's life.

Further, they

will probably ask questions regarding the possibilities that a con-

spiracy existed.

Such general questioning certainly necessitates

that the DCI be made aware of the positions taken during previous

interviews. I raised with Mr. HELMS the nature of the recent

information which you are processing which originated with the

sensitive WHsource.

I informed him that in your view this would

raise a number of new factors with the Commission, that it should

not go to the Commissibn prior to the Director's appearanse unless

we have first had some preliminary reaction or made sure that the

Director is fully aware of its implications since it could well serve

as the Basis forudetailed questioning.

The DDP stated that he would

garefully and made a decision

"estion of timing.

Given the schedule, you will

iate that the DDP

will need a paper covering the above points as soon as possible.

HIBITED

On 17 December Mr. Papich

advised that the Bureau was

anticipating a request from the

Johnson to 100k into this case, for copies of Bureau materials

supporting or complementing the report already submitted. He pro-

vided me with the attached copy of portions of a report passed by

the Legal Attache In Mexico City dealing with theySylvia DURAN

aspect in which it would appear rather clear that

some United States

Government agency was tapping telephones in Mexico.

Mr. Papich

Inquired as to whether information in this report might be given

to the Commission or whether this Agency desired to establish some

other policy with regard to meeting the needs of the Commission.

The matter was discussed with Mr. Whitten and he subsequently ad

vised that as a result of a conference with Mr. Helms and others

In which he was directed to prepare certain materials to be passed

to the Commission, he was quite sure that it was not the desire of

the Agency to make available to the Commission at least in this

manner - via the FBI - sensitive information which could relate to

telephone taps.

Mr. Papich again raised the question on 19

consultation with Mr. Angleton and Mr.

1. One of Oswald's visits to the Cuban Consulate other

See paragraph 11 ot the

2. My conclusion Is that Oswald visited the Cuban

Consulate at least twice and probably three times.

This seems so because:

a. There is no evidence whatever that he was at the

Cuban Consulate at any time on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday Of

Wednesday

b. We know for sure that Oswald was at the Cuban

Consulate at least once on Friday and at least once on

Saturday, see CIA memorandum, pages 6 through 8.

that he visited the Cuban Consulate on

e.: Oswald's argument with Azque was in the after-

occurred after the first visit, see the second police Inter-

the argument with Azque took place was Itself different from

and earlier than the visit to the Cuban Consulate during which

Silvia Duran "confirmed" to Oswald that he would have to get

a Russian visa first and during which she gave Oswald a sl1p

of paper with her name and telephone number; because Azque

telephoned the Russian Consulate after arguing with Oswald,

see paragraph 4 of this memorandum, and Oswald was given

Reference Is made to paragraph 12c.

Was the "direct

1.

Confirming our conversation of 26 June 1963, I make

the

following recommendations concerning the further handling

and

possible disposition of QJWIN:

I believe the original purpose for which

PROHIRITED

competent, usable

agent who is capable of operating in certain

circles

in Europe where we have very few assets.

Whether this

is of sufficient worth to continue his services depends

on the determination of how he can be used either by

he German Station

any other KUBARK Lift as a 1ong

the Austrian Station or by

term unofficial

He is not being used at the present time.

He is being paid but he is on ice as far as any

operational assignments are concerned.

c.

It is recommended that the present Chief of

Station

and RABNEY be consulted by

Headquarters for their best recommendations as to

the continued use of QWIN.

After these recommendations

are received, I suggest that the German and Austrian

stations be consulted for their possible interest in

using him.

If after these discussions a sensible

framework for the operational use of QJWIN can be

established, I would recommend we continue bin.

not,

I would recommend that he be

terminated at the

time his present contract expires.

As far as the ZRRIFLE aspects of this operation

which have been covered under the QJWIN authorization for

security reasons and with which Fletcher M. KNIGHT is fully

familiar as I orally advised you on 26 June 1963,

As soon as I had heard Oswall's name, I recalled

that as Chief of the 6 Branch I had discussed . sometime in Sumner 1960 -

with the then Chief and Deputy Chief of the 6 Research Section the laydng

on of interview(s) through KUJUMP or other suitable channels.

At the

moment I don't recall if this was discussed while Oswald and his family.

were en route to our country of if it was after their arrival.

2.

I remember that Oswald's unusual behavior in the USSR had struck

me from the moment I had read the first ODACID dispatch on him, and I

told my subordinates something amounting to "Don't push too hard to get

the information we need, because this individual looks odd." " We were

particularly interested

in the OI Oswald might provide on the Minsk

factory in which he had been employed, on certain sections of the city

itself, and of course we sought the usual BI that might help develop

target personality dossiers.

3.

I was phasing into my LPOVER cover assignment, and out of KUDOVE, at

the time.

Thus, I would have left our country shortly after Oswald's artival.

I do not know what action developed thereafter.

increasingly interested in watching develop a pattern that we had discovered

in the course of our bio and research work in 6: the number of Soviet

women marrying foreigners, being permitted to leave the USSR, then eventually

divorcing their spouses and settling down abroad without returning "home".

The AEOCEAN 3 case was among the first of these, and we eventually turned

1p something like two dozen similar cases.

We established links between

some of these women and the KGB KUDESK became interested in the developing

trend we had come across-

It was partly out of curiosity to leam if

Oswald's wife would actually accompany him to our country, partly out of

interest in Oswald's own experienced in the U SSR, that we showed operational

intelligence interest in the Harvey story.

Volume V of the SSC Final Report conveys an impression of

limited effort by CIA in the course of the Warren Commission

inquiry. As is noted in other annexes to the present report,

CIA did seek and collect information in support of the efforts

of the Warren Commission. Additionally, it conducted studies and

submitted special analyses and reports.

The following pages list reports and other papers submitted

to the FBI (which had primary responsibility for the investigation)

and to the Warren Commission. It is felt that this compilation

is appropriate to consideration of the extent of the CIA effort,

to the extent that it reveals something of the results of that

effort.

The lists fall into the following sections:

DISSEMINATION OF REPORTS TO CI STAFF

Since CI Staff held the Agency's official file on OSWALD,

all cable traffic (theoretically)

including disseminations by

cable was sent to the Staff for filing in the official file. Ad-

ditionally, cables disseminations were released by CI/Liaison.

Copies were, therefore, available to the Staff.

Since CI Staff released all long-form CSCI's, coordinated

on short-form CSCI's, and maintained the CSCI log, the CI Staff

received copies of all CSCI's.
