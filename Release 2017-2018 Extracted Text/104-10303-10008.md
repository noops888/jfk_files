documentation to non-DDO requesters,

whether they be CLA or other Agency requesters, alvays requires

approval of non-TSD offices.

would be validated by FI Staff/ Departmental Coordination Group

coordination of the operation. BNDD requests are coordinated

1: 1 with DDO/NARCOG. Requests for documentation of Immigration

and Naturalization Service is coordinated via the Alien Affairs
