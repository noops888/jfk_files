the Organization; and who intend to make a career with the Organiza:

In accordance with this definition, l desire to devöte: myself to the faithful:

performance of duty in the Organization, and laccept the obligations and con-

ditions of that service which are determined to be essential to the furtherance of

its mission.

I am aware of the many restrictions necessarily placed upon me by virtue

of the security requirements inherent in my employment by the Organization:

I am also aware that as a member of the Career Staff, it will be my obligation

to serve anywhere and at any time and for any kind of duty as determined by

the needs of the Organization and I have been assured that in order to carry

out this policy, full consideration will be given to my particular capabilities, in-

terests, and personal circumstances. By virtue of this application for mamber-

ship and upon my acceptance in the Coreer Staff, I am assured that, with con

tinuing satisfactory work performance and conduct on my part, just and equila.

ble attention will be accorded my personal progress during my tenure in the

Cäreer Staff.

1 am also assured that, on my satisfactory completion of any

assignments, I will be offered reassignments which are compatible insofar as

possible with my abilities and career interests, and that I shall be entitled to the

benefits now uvailable or to be made available in the future to members of the

Career Staff of the Organization:
