MEMORAITDUDI FOR THE DIRECTOR, FEDERAL

BUREAU OF INVESTIGACION

..:

Although the bulk of criminal offenses occursing

in the course of recent siots have been local rather

chan coderal in nature: the question a=

to whether

there

vas an organization which la, had made aaranceo

plans fos, and (b) was active during any of the ciots

in the summer of 196% is one thai cannot always be

readily resolved by local authoritias.

In view of the

seriousness of the riot activity across the country:

it is most important that you use the marimun aveilanle

resources, investigative and intelligence, to collect

and report all facts bearing upon the question as to

whether there has been or is a scheme or conspiracy by

any Eroio oi whatever size, effectiveness or affiliation,

to plan, promote os aggravate riot activity.

In this connection the following federal statutes

could be applicable depending: of course, moon the desiuel

situation that develops:

Title 18, USC, Section' 2383, which proscribes

the inciting or engaging in any rebellion or

Insurrection against the authority of

the

Unitad States.

Title 18, USC, Section 2384, wich prosarioes

conspiring to overthrow or to destroy by force

the Government of the United States or to

oppose by force the authority thereon or by

• force to prevent, hinder or delay the execution

of any lan of the. United States.

I appreciate that the Bureal. has constantly been

alert to this problem and is currently submitting intelli-

gence raports to us about riots and about the activity of

certain groups and individuals berore, during and aiter

a riot. Indeed, the President hes said both publicly and

privately that the zBI is conducting extensive and comprenen.

sive investigations of these matters.

There persists, however, a widespread belief that

there is more organized activity in the riots than e

presently know about. We must recognize, I believe,

thei

this is a relatively new area of investigation and intelli-

gence reporting for the FBI and the Department of Justice.

We have not heretofore had to deal with the possibility

of an organized pattern of violence, constituting a

violation of federal law, by a group of persons who make

the urban ghetto their base.of operation and whose

activities may not have been regularly monitored by

existing intelligence sources.

• In these circumstánes, we must be certain that

every attenot is being made to get all information

bearing uvon these problons; to take every step possiole

to determine whether the rioting is pre-planned or

organized: and, if so, to determine the identity of

the people and interests. involved; and to deter this

activity by prompt and vigorous legal action.

As a part of the broad investigation which must

necessarily be conducted, it is requested that all

available information be reported and analyzed regard-

•ing each sniver caught in any riot or extremist

activity and. regarding those arrested during the course

of a riot or significant racial disturbances wo were

CONFIDENTIAL, MEMORANDU!

RoosEVELT

This norning, in accordance with the request of the President

conveyed to me personally by him last Wednesday in New York City, I callea

at the white House at 9:15 and was with the President until 10:15.

He was desirous of discussing the question of the subversiva

ecüivities in me Unlied States, particularly Fascism and Coumunisu Se

had previously received the nemorandum thich I had prepared covering ay

conversation with Ganeral Smedley Butler and the effort of Father Coughlia

to have Generalibutler head an expedition to Mexico.

I intormad the Presides

concerning certain recent developments in the Comminist activities in the

countri, particulerly the eiforts of the Bridges organization in San Fran-

cisco and their progressive control of the shipping on the Pacific Coast,

the Gulf Coast and treir recent expansion to shipping operations or the

Atlantic Coast. I told hin that while their contract will expire on

September 30, 1936, they are endeavoring to have it temporarily extended

until April I, 1937, in order to conform to the same date that ine Unitu

Aline Workers' contract expires, thich organization is headed by John I.

Lewis. I told biw that the Bridges organization was practically orüro?]ê&

by Connunists and that the Communists had non decided to make very definite

plans to

got control of the Lewis organization.

I called his attention to the activities of the Newspaper Guild

headed by Heywood Brown, which has strong Communistic leanings, and whies

has been responsible ior putting out of oparation the Seattle Post Intel-

ligencer. I told him that m infomation ras that the Communists had planned

to get control of thesa three groups and by doing so they voulá be able at

any timo to paralyze the country in that they could stoo all shipping in

and out through the Bridges organization; stop the operation of industr

through the hiring Union of Lewis; and stop publication of any nemspapers

of the country tarough the Newspaper Guila.

I also related to him tae activities which have recently oc-

curred nithin Governmental service irspired by Comnunists, particularly

in some of the Departments and in the National Labor Relations Board.

I likewise informed him that I had received information to the

infect that the connuns Invernationale in mascow has recently issued in-

siructions for all Communists in the United States to vota for Prasideni

Roosevolt for realection and against Governor Landon because of the fact

that Governor Landon is opposea to class warfare.

The President stated that he had been considerably concerned

about the movements of the Connunists and of Fascism in the United States

na that while the Secret Servica of the Ireasury Department bad assured

hin that they had inormants in every Communist group, he believed that

If thai was true it was solely for the surpose of getting any infornation

upon plots upon his life, hercas what he was interested in was obtaining

a broad pictura of ine genaral movement and its activities as may affect te

econonic and political life of toe country as a mole. I told him thai thera

is at the present time no governmental organization vaich is getting any

so-called "genaral intelligence information" upon this subject. He inquired

what suggestions i nignu orter relative to this matier.

I toid hin ai

the appropriation of ine Federal Bureau of Investigation contains a provi-

sion that it night investigae any matters referres to it by the Deparinent

of State and that if the State Department should ask lor us to conduct such

an investigation ne coulà do so under our present authority in te anpro-

priatica already granted. He stated that he is reluctant to have a 10s2ai

requesi cone through the State Department because of the many leaks therein, i

but that shat he nould do toula be to put a handritten memorandum of sis.

on in his safe in the linite House, stating he had instructed the secrevary

of State to revuest tels information to ba obtained by the Department

Justice.

He stated he would have the Secretary of State at the Wite House

tomorro: afternoon, and asked me to call at the mite Housa at 1:45 p.r.

to see him, the President, and the Sacretary of State, at mnici time the

matter could be further discussed and an oral request could be made on ue

by the Sscretary of Stata for investigation so as to avoid ary possivility

of any leak.

He sugsested that I endeavor to coordinate any investigation

along similar lines nich night be made by the Military oi Naval Intelligence

ServiCES. He stated that the Secret Service was not being brought in on this

investigation as they should confine themselves strictly to the matier of

protecting his life and the survey nich he desired to have made was on a

much broader field.

CONFTDENTIAL MENORANDUM

Poday, in line nith the request of the President, I called at the

White House at 1:15 p.n., and present at the conference were the Presideni,

the Secretary of State and mysel •*

The President related to the Secretary o

State his concern -lative to Conninist activities in this country, as "ell as

*Fascist activities. He stated that he was very desirous of having a survey

made of these conditions and inforned the Secretary of State that this surey

could be made by. tre Department of Justice if the Secretary of State requested

the Departuent to conduct the inquiry, as under the Appropriation het this

Bureau would have autiority to make such investigation if asked to do so sy

the Secretary oi Suate.

The President pointed out that both of these love-

ments vere interrutional in scope and the Commisn particularly vas directed

from Moscon, and tact inere had been certain indications that Ownsi, at

tonhen in the Russian Soviet Erbassy, ras a leadirg figure in some of the

activities in this rountry, so consequently, it was a matter which feli wither

the scope of foreign affairs over which the State Department rould have a rigit

to request an inquiry to be tisce.

The Secrotary of State irguired if a request should be made in

writing.

The President indicnted that it should not be sizce he desired tee

matter to be handles quite confidentially and that it would be sufficient that

the President, the Secretary of state and I should be the ones aware of this

request.

The Secrotary of Siate asked that the investigation be nade anù tien

made several suggestions - one, relative to the making of a protest, gitaer

formally or inforcally, to the Pussian Government relative to its intes ere-co

with affairs in this country. Discussion vas also had as to the iniosmtion

obtained irdicating that the Third Internationale had indicated preference fos

Roosevelt as egainst Landon. It las the opinion of the President that some

statement should be rade along this line by the Attorney General at an early

date.

Tho President asked that I speak to the Attorney General, upoi his re-

turn to the city, about this matter, and he suggested to the Socretary o

State that he talk orer the technique to be follored in this particular aspect,

with the Attorney tieroral.

UBJECT:

FBI JURISDICTION: CRIMINAL

INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION

DATE:

5/16/72

You requested analysis of the legal authority for FBI

criminal intelligence collection and its relationship to ow statutory

jurisdiction in criminal matters.

"The gathering of criminal intelligence information"

describes activity not subject to precise definition. However, its

general objective is well understood by those engaged in law entorcement.

There exist individuals and groups whose daily occupations are direciod

toward proût without regard to the restraints or ine law. rei, y ine

very nature of their associations. little actual participation in criminal

acis may be observed by the most astute law enforcement observer.

Their existence and contribution to the sum of criminal behavior has been

detected and to some degree measured by the collection of data concerning

their personallife-styles, property holdings, associates, influence, and

access to capital. Such information has been characterized as "criminal

intelligence.

For years, the FBI has been aware of the need to identity

these resources of the criminal element. Congress responded to this

need through the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970.

The Congressional

findings were that organized crime in the United States is a highly.

sophisticated, diversified, and widespread activity that annually drains

billions of dollars from America's economy by unlawful conduct and by

the illegal use of force, fraud and corruption.. Legitimate business and

labor unions are infiltrated and corrupted and our democratic processes

are subverted. The problem was declared lo be of of national concern

both as to our economy and the domestic security.

Memorandum J. A. Mintz to Mr. Dalbey

RE: FBI JURISDICTION: CRIMINAL

INTELLICENCE INFORMATION

The Act attempted to attack organized crime by making

criminal the management of syndicated gambling and by prohibiting

racketecring activity characteristic of organized crime including the

use of illegal proceeds for investment in legitimate business enterprises.

The long-established suspicions of law enforcement officer's

were confirmed by the Congressional findings but statutory enactments

did not eliminate the conduct described as evil therein. There remains

the task of establishing the identities of those constituting the national

menace and developing prosecutable evidence of their guilt.

"Criminal

intelligence" collection is one means by which this responsibility may

be fulfilled. It may be the only practical means in view of the scarcity

of witnesses willing to testify and of the high mortality potential of those

who do appear. A classic example of such intimidation is reported in

United Statos v. Addonizio, 451 F2d 49 (3rd Ulr. 1572) Where d Muoveüire

cose found an ancaymale anto on the cost of hic

car which read "This could have been a bomb. Keep your mouth shut. "

" Accepting the need for intelligence gathering as a practical

necessity,

the issue remains as to its propriety in the face of Consticutiona

protections.. If the Supreme Court announces that individuals have a

Constitutionally protected right of privacy that may be overcome only

through established arrest, search, and subpoena procedures, the issue

will be settled. But, thus far, the Court has only drawn upon the concept

of Constitutional privacy to resolve cases involving special circumstances

such as marital affairs (Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965) ) and

interception of communications (Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967)

More specific Constitutional limitations on the criminal

intelligence function may be found in the First Amenciment protections of

speech and assembly; the Fourth Amendment prohibitions of unreasonavie

searches and seizures; and the Fifth Amendmont priviloge against

compulsory sclf-incrimination.

The theme consistently found in decisions having a bearing on tl

relationship between these rights and the collection of criminal intolligo co

is that, when in direct conflict, the collection ciforts must yield. Such is

Memorandum J. A. Mintz to Mr. Dalbey

RE: FBI JURISDICTION: CRIMINAL

INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION

not to label criminal intelligence as necessarily the product of malpractice.

but to recognize the paramount nature of the Constitutional interests being

safeguarded: Other incidents of government regulatory authority have

been required to yield as well when confronted with legitimate claims of

Constitutional protection, e.g: the administrative search cases; Camara .

Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523 (1967).

Overt and obtrusive conduct susceptible of being characterized

as harassment may well be enjoined as, for example, was the case of an

obvious 24-hour-a-day physical surveillance of an individual, his home,

relatives, friends, and associates (Giancana v. Johnson, 335 E2d 366

(7th Cir. 1964) cort. den. 379 U.S. 1001. Similar results might be

expected where an identified officer loiters in the subject's place of

business (Bee See Books. Inc. v. Leary, 291 F. Supp. 622 (SD V. Y. 1963)

or openly attends organizational meetings where his presence innivits

ammuninition and tha trancention ni the hainage of tha acconnhis (Tincai

309, United Furniture Workers V. Gates, 75.F. Supp. 620 (ND Ind. Ised) ).

However, open photographic surveillance of public gatherings (Donahoe v.

Duling, 330.F. F. Supp. (ED (ED Va. 1971)) and secret monitoring of

criminal activities through the use of undercover agents (Levis v. United

States, 385 U.S. 206 (1966) ) and informants (Hoffa V. United States, 355

U.S. 295 (1966) ) have met with judicial approval.

Obviously, criminal intelligence information gained by un-

reasonable search and seizure or through compelled self-incrimination is

tainted and subject to judicial condemnation upon complaint of one having

the requisite standing.

Perhaps, the decision coming ncarest to discussing the

legality of criminal intelligence collection was Anderson v. Sills. 106 N. J.

Super. 545, 256 A2d 298 (1969), (reversed on the ground more complete

record was necded to support the decision) 56 N.J. 210, 265 A2d 678 (1970)

New Jersey had responded to the threat of continuing civil disorders by

collecling intelligence information on persons and events alleyed to have

some relationship to such activitics. The trial court held the collection

effort to be unconstitutional because it conflicted with the First Amendment

RE: FBI JURISDICTION: CRIMINAL

INTELLIGENCE NFORMATION

However, the court order to destroy the intelligence files excepted instances

"where such information will be used to charge persons with specificall;

defined criminal conduct." 256 A2d at 305. Thus, the decision may be

interpreted as drawing a distinction between collection of intelligence

information where political or social factors are involved and First

Amendent freedoms therefore may be directly inhibited and collection.

of criminal intelligence information where the objective is the establishmen:

of criminal conduct and the identities of the offenders. While the Fourth

and Fifth Amendment may be enjoyed by the guilty and innocent alike, it

is improbable that the First Amendment would be stretched so far as to

protect freedom of speech and assembly when such speech and assembly

constitute clements of a criminal offense. On appeal, the Supreme Court

of New Jersey returned the case for further development of the record

and observed "

.. . the executive branch may gather whatever information

A tentative conclusion may be stated, subject to further develoy-

ment of the case law. The gathering of criminal intelligence information

for the purpose of developing evidence of specific offenses characieristic

of organized crime is legally justified as well as practically necessary.

Where there is diversion from the proper objective and such collection

efforts are manipulated to cause harassment or where such activity conflicts

with Constitutional rights, to that extent the criminal intelligence program

must be reformed.

FROM

: J. B. Hotis

SUBJECT:

FBI AUTHORITY IN DOMESTIC

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

You requested an analysis of the Bureau's authority to conduct

domestic intelligence investigations. The question of the jurisdictional

basis for these investigations is being examined at length by the Domestic

Intelligence Division and will not be discussed here.

It is fair to say that the domestic intelligence program is one

of the more controversial areas of the Bureau's activities. For one thing,

an intelligence investigation casts a broader net than inquirics that are

die ced toward the proof ofa sporifir offense.

A large amount of raw cinta

is collected, much of which has no immediate bearing on potentiai offenses

or offenders. But seemingly trivial information may later become important

in the detection and prevention of violence or civil disorder. There are

also fears that these investigations may. eventually touch upon one's

political belieis, habits or associations; or that information coliected for

proper purposes may eventually be misused at the hands of Government.

Each is a legitimate concern. The notion of Government prying into the

personal lives of its citizens is repellent to all of us. And yet there is a

strong sense that the Government must acquire necessary intelligence

information if it is to meet its responsibilities in connection with the

national seculty.

One of the major concerns about our domestic intelligence

activities is that they are not supervised or monitored by any outside

agency. The claim is made that the Esecutive Branch has been left wide

discrction to define its own authority, and to choose the directions, mothods,

• and focus of its investigations. For one thing, the law has never made

clear what facts and circumstances must be present to authorize an

intelligence investigation, nor how far such an investigation may lawlully

proceed without being directed toward proof of a specific offense.

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

And unlike the practice in criminal cases, our electronic surveillances in

security matters are not submitted for prior court approval. For anothcr,

the exclusionary rule which provides the usual incthod of judicial control

over investigative.procedurcs, is not often availbic in security cases.

Since the goal is largely preventive, these cases seldom come before the

courts. As a result, the public, the courts, and the Congress have very

Little information about how we operate in domestic intelligence matters.

and what we do with the information acquired.

In response to this situation, some members of the Congress have

pressured for tighter controls over the Bureau, perhaps in the form of a

watchdog committee to oversee our operations.

Senator Ervin, who chairs

the Senate Subsommittee on Constitutional Rights has expressed particular

concern about the right of privacy and the authority of the Government to

gather information. In an exchange of correspondence with the Departmeut

of Justice, the Sentor has requested specific documentation of the

Department's guidelines for the gathering and retention of domestic

intelligence information. He has also suggested nat iegisiaiion mighi ve

enacted, requiring a showing of probable cause before an investigation can

be initiated by the Government. It is doubtful that any such measue would

pass the Congress, but the proposal does show the mood of the times.

A parallel trend may be developing in the courts. In several

recent cases, plaintifis have made the claim that Government information

gathering, which goes beyond the effort to apprehend criminal suspecis;

may have a "chilling cffect"' on the exercise of First Amendment rights.

These challenges thus far have not been successful. Anderson v. sills:

56 N. J. 210, 265 A2d 678 (1970); Donahoe v. Duling, 330 I. Supp. 300

(E. D. Va. 1971); American Civil Liberties Union v. Westmorcland. 323

F. Supp. 1153 (N.D. Ill. 1971).

The courts have generally recognized that one of the principal

functions of the Bureau is to gather information law violators, agitators of

Peace Parade Committce, ctal. v. J. Edgar Hoover, ci. al., 70 Ci. 2540

such information is determinative of the significance of any allegus chill lo

to First Amendmentrights. Thus, in Davis v. Ichord, 442 E2d 1207 (D. C.

Cir. 1970) although appellants allegedly felt chilled by a Congressional

Committce's investigation of them, the Court of Appeals found there was.

insufficient justiciability in their claims to create a viable case or

controversy. This was because appellants had "failed to bring the fear oi

investigation by the present Committee home to themselves,' their fears

were wholly speculative; there were no criminal proceedings contronting

them; nor was any action pending. Moreover, the Court in Davis found

that the power of a Congressional Committee began and ended with the

investigation; whenever a Committee of the Congress seeks punilive action;

the Judiciary must become involved, and thus every investigation has a

judicial check which operates to guarantee the protection of constitutional

rights.

This latter aspect of the Davis decision was given perspecare by

the Court of Appeals in Tatum. In contrasting the potential impact on First

Amendment rights occasioned by investigations conducted by the military

with investigations conducted by a civilian investigative agency, such as the

Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Court observed:

The compilation of data by a civilian investigative

agency is thus not the threat to civil liberties or the

deterrent on the exercise of the constitutional right

of free speech that such action by the military is, because

a civil investigative agency has no inherent power always

being subject to the well-defined restrictions of law and

the approval of the courts. * **

There,the Court pantedly examined the "source of the chill!' as it had in

Davis, and in applying the "chilling effect doctrine", singled out the FBI

as a source which does not senerate a reasonable basis for inhibitions or

apprchensions. In this connection the Court stated.

Memorandum

B. Hotis to Mr. Dalbey

RE: FBI AUTHORITY IN DOMESTIC

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

Referring to our holding in Davis that the

"source of the chill"' is important in determining whether

there is any inhibiting cilect on the exercise of First

Amendment rights, we think that there is a significant

difference between investigative actions taken by a

military agency in reference to civilians and similar

investigative actions taken by a regular investigative

agency of a civilian branch of the Government.

One of the functions of a civilian investigative

agency, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is

to compile information on law violators, agitators of

violence, and possible subversives. It has always been

recognized that this is a delicate function, and it is

exercised under the direction of the Attorney General.

Investigation is performed by man a majority of wiùm die

under the direction of lawyers in the Justice Depariment,

and the information compiled is only usable and effective

through court action. The FBI is powerless to imprison

or to affect his liberty in any way except through the

action of the couts.

As to the surveillance of public meetings through the use of

informants, it has been held that such surveillance is not per se actionable.

See Donahoe v. Duling. 330 F. Supp. 308 (E.D. Va. 1971) (police -

surveillance of street demonstrations held not to offend First Amendment

rights).

The Supreme Court in Hoffa v. U.S., 385 U.S. 293 (19G6), hold

that the usc of secret informants is "not per se unconstitutional"

, and does

not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against sclf-incrimination, nor

the Fourth Anendment prohibition against unrcasonable searches and

seizures. The Court upheld, as reasonable under the Fourth Amendment,

admission at trial of evidence obained by an undercover informant to whom

a defendant spoke without knowledge that he was in the employ of the police.

385 U.S. at 300-303. See also Lewis v. U.S., 385 U.S. 200 (1066) and

Lopez v. U.S., 373 U.S. 427 (1963).

Memorandum J. B. Hotis-to Mr. Daibey

RE: FBI AUTIIORITY IN DOMESTIC

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

Moreover,

the Supreme Court in U.S: V. Whitc, 401 U.S. 745

(1971), recently held that the use of secret informants does not violate

any constitutionally justifiable espectation of privacy under the Fourth

Amendment, even wheh an informant uses electronic equipment to transmit

his conversations with defendants to other agents.

If the use of undercover government informants without a

warrant does not violate the Fourth Amendment and invade a defendant's

constitutionally justifiable expectations of privacy, Hofia v. U.S., supra.

and such informants may write down their conversations with ceiendants

and testify concerning them, or simultaneously record and transiit such

conversations to others, who may testify against them, On Lce v. U.S.,

343 U.S. 747 (1952); U.S. V. White, supra, then clearly mere visuai

"surveillenco" ef plaintlte in plair tiow by informanto at publio mcclngs

would not violate their constitutionai rights.

It would seem that those who elect to present their views actively

in the public arena delibcrately expose themselves to the public. See

Associated Press v. Walker. 388 U.S. 130 (1907). Any recording of their

activitics by the deienciants does not invade their privacy any more than

does a newspaper, radio, or television story, and, indecd, much less since

any information compiled is usable and effective only through coutaction.

Tatum v. Laird, 444 F2d 947, 957 (D. C. Cir. 1971).

More difficult questions are presented where the investigation

delves into the private affairs of the individuals or organizations. But

even here, the courts have generally sustained our procedures so long as

they comport with the restrictions of the Fourth, Filth and Sisth Amendments

Re: FBI AUTHORITY IN DOMESTIC

In summary, it is premature to say that the First Amendment

line of cases, dealing with the "chilling" concept offers any substantial

impediment to our intelligence investigations. There is less reason for

optimism, however, with regard to congressional intervention. We

should be arcpared,

therefore, to meet arguments regarding the need

for outside supervision. The sound answer, which should satisfy

governmental needs and individual rights, is found in tight internal

controls and carefully developed guidelines.

Espionage and Foreign Intelligence Investigations

The mission of the FBI In the

foreign intelligence

Liold is one of counterintelligence. The objectives and

priorities of counterintelligence have been variously stated

Dud evaluated. Generally, these objectives may be listed in

doclining priority as follows: (1) the detcotion and

= 21 ∞

-NW-54933-Docld:32989719_Page_50

## Page 51

identification of intelligence operations and agents;

(2) the penetration of these operations for the purpose

of control aud the development of intolligence infornation;

(3) neutralization of hostile intelligence operations through

disruption and disinformation; and, (1) prosecution. Matever

the

assigned priority, the overall objeciive is to deny access

to information sought by whatever practical means are available.

Foreign intelligence investigations are grounded in

the Espionage statute. and related laws including the Registr

tion and Atomic Energy Acts. Individual investigations are

Initiated usually on the basis of a know or suspected connec

tlon with a foreign Intelligence service, foreign country or

subversive organization vith such connoctions. Since these

Investigations emanate from various sensitive sources and.

involve special considerations, extensive criteria and

limitations are defined and enumerated in current instructions.

In general terms, the governing criteria are desiened

to preclude initiation and continuance of investigations which

are not justified. The limitations are designed to coutrol

the scope of investigation in order to insure security of our

, Interests through close supervisory scrutiny.

ANDMUTIORITY I. DO IESTIC

INTELLIGIICE INVISTIGATIONS

During our mecting on July 26, 1973, you referred to a discussion

you had with &chator Charles MeC. Nathias, Ir., of Maryland during your con-

firmation hearings as to the statutory authority of the FBl and the l'epartment of

Justice in the lield ol domestic intelligence investigations. You then arlied

Mr. Wiltium D. Ruckelhens to work with the FBI in weighing the pros and cons

with roguad to stautory authority in this crca. I mentioned that rescarch was

touch with fir. Ruchclahous with regard to this matter when we have completed

the recults of our concideration and lindings within the FBI.

Actually, i study has been going on in the FBI for more than two

jears as to tho scope of Fill jurisdiction and authority in comestic intelligenc

invostigations. When Mi'. I. Patrick Gray, III, was designated as Acting

Directur cí the FEI, he inctructed that a position paper be propared concern-

ing the jurisdiction and authority of the FBI to conduct domestic intelligence

investigations. A position paper was prepared which in essence sinted that

authority of the Fill in this field is based on legislative enectments, even

though te may have publicly relicd heavily on Presidential directives as the

basis for such authority. Ir. Giay cidered mn in-depth study made of the

position and in August, 1972, a detailed report was furnished to him. The

following is a summary of that report.

Over a period of several months there were a number of public

siatelients questioning authority and jurisdiction of the Fill to conduct comestic

intelligence-type investigations, particularly where there is no clear-cut

legislative authority apparent. One of the most scarching inquiries was con-

tained in a paper presented by Professor John I. EluS et a two-dey, conicence

it Princeton University in October, 1971, sponsored by the C'ommittee for Public

Justice.

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 57

## Page 58

The Atturney General

A major thrust of Proicssor Ellill's paper concerned F'BI authority

derived fron legislative enactmunts as opposer to that derived from Presidential

circetives, begitning with & directive insued by President Roosevelt in

Sepêundor, 1929, Protossor Illitf is of the opinion that Die 1939 dircetive,

which was reiterated on three subsequent occasions, was magnitied by the

FbI from its original purpose to a definitive order to conduct intelligence-type

investigations.

Senctor Sam i. Irvin, as you know, had been probing into the

nature and oxtont of R3l intellionce-type investigations. Sonator Ervin had

even announced that he intended to propose legislation to prohibit the kEl

from investigation ony persor: without that incividual's cousent, unless the

Government has renson to bolicre that person las committed a crime or is

about to commit a crime. Other Congresanch indicated a similar interest

in Fil investigative activities..

Our study revealed that the fBI had deulnred publicly over a

long period of time that its responsibilities in the domestic intellicunce field

are authorized under legislative enactments, I'resicential directives, and

instruetions of the Attorney General. The Presidential dircutives are obviously

the 1) directive Cuted Septenbe: G, 1030, tud reiterated January 8, 1943;

July 24, 1050; and December i5, 19J3, und 2) Exccutive Order 10450 dated

April 27, 1953 (ond anencied but not yet implemented by Ixecutive Order

11G05 dated July 2, 1971) •

In curcfully analyzing, the languege of the first dircotive, dated

September 0, 1930, and considering that the subsequent directives are all

hinged on that one, le believe that there is a misconception as to the extent

of jurisdiction or authority conveyed to the FBi by those dircetives. It

appearc that while the 1939 directive fixed responsibility on the FBI to handle

espionoge, sabotage, and neutrality mattors, it did not convey any authority

or jurisdiction which the Fäl did not alroudy have from lugislative enuctments.

It is dilficult to road into this directivo or in any of those which followed ary

autharity to conduct intelligence-typo investigations which would or could

not la conducted under an umbrella of legislative enactments.

As a matet of historical frot, President loosevelt in August,

1936, did roquest former Directs) e. Idgar lioover to conduct inventinations

of subversive setivition in this country, including communion anu losciem.

This request, horever, was a contidential cral request and there le doubt

that any record o it was made cuiside the Fil. This request, or frosidential

mandite, was based, iucidentrily, on the fact that the law provided that the

ral could conduct nuch investigationa il the accretary of Stale should so

rogusit.

The study roverlud that while the 1033 et sug, dircetives did no:

frant cuy special intelligence-guthoring cuthority to the FCI, we were respon-

sibla under these dircotives to cellect all intelligence infoenation furnished

lu local, site, and Federal law enforcomont agencies and patriotic cisons

and to cift and coordinate all such information fur indications of subversive

setivity covered by Fodoral stainies.

The study concluded that the FDI has the responsibility to con-

duct whatever investigations tie tiecessary to dotormine if sictutes relating

to espioutge, satolege, insurrecion or rebellion, sedition, sediticus con-

spiracy, covocacy of overthrowing; the Government, and other suen crimes

affecting the national sccurity have been viciated. In Dis connection we

note that in a letter datod September 11, 1967, the Department of únetico

advisud that the FDI is continually alert io the problem of rocurring riots

and is submitting intellirenco reports to the bopertment of justico concern-

ing such uctivity, 'This lutter enumerated several Puderes utatutes and

In other words, the Department was requesting all possible

intolligence-type investigative aetivity based on the existence of curtain

statutos. We sec this as being no ditcrent irom our intellgeroe-type

The Attorney Goboral

As to the need for an Executive order, we think that to issues

are involved. No have statutory authority, but what we need is a dictinitive

reguirement from the President as to the nature anci type of iniciligence data

he roquires in the pursuit on his responsibilities based on our statutory

authority, In other words, there is a neod, from our stundpoint, (ol both

authoritative and definitive guidelines. The statutes five us the authority.

The Exocutive order would defino our national security objectives.

Members of Congress, Including such mer as Senaior Robert C.

Byrd of Heat Virpiria, have proposed legiliation to spoll out jurisdiction and

authority of the kil in this ficid. It would appear lint the Presidunt would

rather spell out lis own roquirements in an Executive ordar instead of having

Congress tell hiin what the kul night do to hulp him fujill' his obligations and

responsibilities as in'esident.

The political clinite of cuspivion and distrust resulting ircm

disclosures coming out os the Potorgato nearings could present so costecle

to getting any such Eaccutivo order signed in the immediato futize. However,

the rationale is novertheless valid ind when scrutinized closely, the language

‚In the Executive order wo horcinalter propose establishes definitive guidelince

which have heratsfore been unclear. It is my belief that we should go forward

with tisia.

We therafora propose and recommend that on Executive order

along the following lines be subinitted to the While louse with s strong

killing of police officers who, by their uniform, are a symbol of the democratic

establishment; hijaching of sircraft in furtherance of revolutionary novements:

terrorist assaults on foreign diplomatic personnel and establishinents; und open

declaretion of war on our' form of government are only a few of the violent acts

which have been perpetrutec by doinestic subversives who seek to destroy or

seriously cripple our Government. Terrorist guerrilla ittacks which were

once confined to far away places and relued to problems of no immediate con-

cern ol ours are now possible in this country. Forcign terrorist groups in

collusion with domestic terrorists have laid plans for in airport messacre of

the type which recently occurred in Isracl. Other foreign terrorist elcents

have laid plans for (errorist attucks on American soil. Already oue foreign

official has been assassinated, possibly by terrorists.

It would be folly to adopt an investigative policy based on

the concept of investigation only when there is rcason to believe a crime

involving the national security has been committed. The FBI must

obviously anticipate the crimes described move. We believe thut in

order for the Government to be in position to defend itself against revolu

tionary and terrorist efforts to destroy it, the FBI must have sufficient

investigative ithority to conduct intelligence-type investigations not

normally associated with enforcement of the statutes. In other words we

think the President has the inherent Executive power to expand by further

defining the FBI's investigative authority to cnable it to develop advance

information concerning the ylans and aspirations of terrorists and revolu-

tionaries who seek to overthrow or destroy the Govornment. However, we

_ also belleve that such expanded authority must be forinally set forth in an

Executive order and that this recommendation is responsive in the Attorney

Genersi's expressed interest in laying more formal guidelines to our work:

in areas where definition is not now clear.

We consider the issuance of a new Executive order delineating

our jurisdiction, authority, and responsibility to gather and report intolligence

information relating to the national security to be a very important and high

priority matter. Ye believe the issuance of guidelines by the Attorney Genoral

under Title 28, Section 533, United States Code, to be equally important.

Encutive Order 10450

DATE: NOV 1: 1971

This is in response to; your menoranda, entitled as above,

dated hay 8, 1974 and August 19, 1974, directed to the Deputy

Executive Order 11785 which amends Executive Order 10450. In

view of the involvement of my staff in these matters, I will

undertake to answer your questions with the concurrence of the

criminal Division.

As you know this matter has been under continuing review

both in the Task Force, chaired by a representative of this

office, of working level representatives of various agencies

in the

security field and is now under study to a lesser degree

in Project #10 of the

"Domestic Council on Privacy".

You ask that the Department; (a) provide specific instruc-

tions to the Bureau to conduct intelligence-type investigations

to identify and determine the activities of organizations nov

described in the amended Section 8(a) (5) of Executive Order

10450; (b) furnish guidelines to be used by the Bureau

in 1n1-

tiating investigations of individuals under the captioned matter

pursuant to Executive Order 10450 and specifically, criteria to

be utilized in determining whether available information is a

sufficient basis for investigation.

Under the amendment to Section 8(a) (5) of Executive Order

20450, we now have only two types of organizations; (1) those

which

unlawfully advocate or practice the commission of acts

of force or violence to prevent others from exercising their

rights under the constitution or laws of the United States or

NW 4933 Docld:32989719 Page 65

---

## Page 66

any State, (2) or which scek to overthrow the Government of

the United States, or any State or subdivision thereof, by

unlavful peans: (Emphasis added).

Of course, the key words which are underlined indicate

that the investigation should be initially based on a possible

violation of a federal. (such as the Smith Act) or state statute

prohibiting unlawful advocacy or the commission of any unlawful

act of force or violence. However, in order for the Bureau to

detoct organizations with a potential of the above nature, it

is important that tie

investigation proceed on the basis of in-

formation indicating thai the organization nay be of the

natuse

mentioneà. It is not necessary that a crime occur before the

investigation is initiated, but.only that a reasonable evaluation

of the available information suggests that the activities of the

organization may fall within the proscription of the Order. Ihe

most recent example of the type of organization, that you have

advised is becoming more prevalent, is the small but dedicated

to violence, Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA). Organizations. of

this natic would ciearly ials within the order and should se

investigated as soon as infonnation is available indicating their

potentiality for violence and of course, if possible, prior to

the fulfillment of their purposes.

It is true that Executive Order 11785 eliminated the prior

communist, totalitarian, fascist, and subversive characterizations

and definitions, but there was no intention of restricting the

investigations of such organizations if their programs call for

acts of force or violence or the unlawful advocacy of the com-

mission of acts of force or violence in furtherance of these

programs.

It is not possible to set definite parameters covering the

initiation of investigations of potential organizations falling

within the Order but once. the investigation reaches a stage that

offers a basis for determining that the activities are legal in

nature, then the investigation should cease, but if the investi-

gation suggests a determination that the organization is engagea

in illegal activities or potentially illegal activities it should

continue.

' It follows in answer to your second question that indivia-

uals who are active either as members of or as affiliates of

2

NUV 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 66

---

## Page 67

zations described above should be investigated when

nation is received indicating their involvement. The

yardstick indicated above for organizations in deter-

fing whether the investigation should continue, should apply

incerning individuals and when a determination can reasonably

e made that the individuals activities, either within the

organization or as an individual, do not appear to be in vio

lation of any law, then the investigation should cease.

BASIS FOR FBI NATIOTAL

SECURITY INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS

On July 31, 1972, the Intelligence Division issued

a position paper which in effect drew the conclusion that the

FBI has the responsibility to conduct whatever investigations

are necessary to determine if statutes relating to espionage.

sabotage, insurrection or rebellion, sedition, seditioue

conspiracy, advocacy of overthrowing the Government and

other such crimes affecting the national security have been

violated. In carrying out this responsibility, the FBI has

the authority to undertake Investigation prior to the actual

commitment of such a crine to determine if groups or

Individuals are engaging in activities which if uninterrupted

could result in a violation of a specific statute. . The

position paper noted that the FBI had declared publicly

over a long period of time that its responsibilities in the

donestic intelligence fleld were authorized under legislative

enactnents, Presidental directives, and instructions of the

Attorney General. The Presidential dircctives cited were

those of September 6, 1939, and three subsequent ones of

January 8, 1943, July 21, 1950, and December 15, 1953, which

reiterated the directive of Septenber 6, 1939. It was stated

that it was belloved there was a misconception as to the

extent of jurisdiction or authority conveyed to the FBI by

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 71

---

## Page 72

these directives. It was said that it appeared that while

the 1939 directive fixed-responsibility on the FBI to handle

espionage, sabotage and ncutrality matters it did not convey

any authority or jurisdiction which the FBI did not already

have fron legislative chactments.

The position paper was forwarded to former Acting

Director Gray but no action was taken with respect to it.

Following the appoiniment of MI. Kelley as Director of the

. FBI, on August 7, 1373, the results of the study were called

to the attention of the Attorney General by letter and it

was suggested to him that an executive order be prepared which

would in effect establish definitive guidelines which it was

felt had been theretofore unclear.

Subsequently on August 24, 1973, at the request

of the Department, we furnished to MI. Milllam D. Ruchelshaus,

the Deputy Attorncy General Designate, a copy of the position

paper together with a copy of Section 87 of our manual in

which new guidelines had been promulgated to assure that the

field thereafter predicated investigations in the internal

security area of our operations on specific statutes.:' The-new

manual section had been issued and went into effect during

August, 1973.

The copies of the position paper and our new Section

87, of the Manual of Instructions, were returned to us by

•the Departnent without comment. On Septenber 12, 1973, the

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 72

## Page 73

Attorney General stated. that he thought it would be premature

to recommend to the President that an executive order be

Issued until "we were fairly certain in our own minds as to

how much should be and can be accomplished at each level of

delegation.". There has been no followup from the Department

with regard to the Attorney General's statements as of this

time.

On June 1 and 5, 1974, Assistant-Director V. R.

, Wannall and former Inspector Thomas J. Smith of the Intelligence

Division appeared before the Committee on Internal Security

House of Representatives (Ichord Committee). The results

of their testimony are set forth in a publication entitled

"Domestic Intelligence Operations for Internal Security

Purposes Part I." Pertinent portions of this testimony

appear on pages 3571 through 3574 and on page 3591. These

sessions of the conmittee were under the direction of

Kr. Alfred M. Nittle, Legislative Counsel of the Conmittee,

and he propounded most of the questions.

Referring to the directive of September 6, 1939,

Mx. Nittle said, "Now for the purpose of carrying out that

directive, has the Attorney General by standing and general

orders now in effect instructed the FBI as to precisely

what investigative work is to be enoraced within the expression

'subversive activities?""

3

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 73

## Page 74

In responding to the question, Wannall Icad into

the record a strictly confidential memorandum dated

September 10, 1936, prepared by former Director Hoover for

MI. E. A. Tamm, Associate Diroctor. In the memorandum,

Mr. Hoover

referred to a conversation he had had that day

during which it. Hoover briefed the Attorney General with rogard

to a conference he had had with the President on September

1936, during. which the Secretary of State was present and

requested Mr. Hoover as the representative of the Department

of justice "to have investigation made of the subversive

activities in this country, Including communism and facism."

The memorandum shows that the Attorney General verbally

directed Mr. Hoover to proceed with this investigation and

to coordinate, as the President suggested, information upon

these matters

in the possession of the Military Intelligence

Division and the Naval Intelligence Division. In effect,

this

constituted a standing and general order to the FBI from

the Attorney General with regard to the Presidential directive

of September 6, 1939. While the Attorney General's order pre-

ceded the September 6, 1939, directive by some three years,

it has never been abrogated and the manner in which it

relates to the order of 1939 will be explained hereinafter.

Mr. Nittle then pointed out that he saw no specific

reference to statutes which would show basis for the FBI to

•- Investigate subversive activities. It was explained to him

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 74

---

## Page 75

that prior to the issuance of MI. Hoover's September 10, 1936,

menorandum he had had meetings at the thite louse, one of

which included the Secretary of State, and Mr. Hoover had

insisted that the Secretary of State request that the FBI

conduct investigations

relating to subversive activitics,

including comnunism and facism, since under Title 18, Section

533, U. S. Code, the Attorney General is authorized to instruct

the IBI to conduct such other investigations as are required

by the Secretary of State in carrying out his authority.

Later during the testimony, MI. Nittle pointed out that it

was his assumption that at least one of the bases for the

President's authority for issuing the directive of September 6,

1939, was his constitutional duty to protect and defond the

Constitution and that it was adequate to lend support to the

Federal investigative jurisdiction vithout reference to any

statutes. It was acknowledged that the FBI does not question

the Constitutional power of the president to delegate

Investigative jursidiction.

Following his appearance before the Ichord

: =.

Committec, Wannall undertook personally to conduct research to

determino if there is a basis for concluding that rBI intclli-

gence investigations are in fact based upon a delegation of

authority under the President's Constitutional powers. This

course was pursued for the following reasons:

∞ 5 =

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 75

## Page 76

•1. In testimony before the Appropriations

Committees, Ir. Hoover had consistently stated that the FBI's

responsibilitics in the domestic Intelligence field are auth-.

orized under legislative enactments, Presidential dircotives

and instructions of the Attorney General. He said they include

Investigative jurisdiction over matters relating to espionage,

counterespionage, sabotage, treason, sedition; subversion

and related internal security functions. He pointed out that

subjects of investigation included the Communist Party USA,

Communist Front Groups and other totalitarian organizations

Including Individuals or groups who are alleged either to

seck the overthrow the Government of the United States by

force or violence or to conspire against the rights of citi-

zens. He further stated the FBI has primary responsibility

for Investigating matters of these types in the United States,

Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Following his testimony,

the Congress consistently appropriated funds to permit the

FBI to carry out investigations in these areas.

•2. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Kevin C.

Maroney of the Criminal Divison of the Department made

appearances before the Ichord Conmittee: on February 20, April 1

and April 2, 1974. Ilis testinony as recorded on pages 3366

and 3439 of the publication "Domestic Intelligence Operations

for Internal Security Purposes Part I" contained statements

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 76

---

## Page 77

bearing on this subject matter. For example, after Mr. Nittle

had referred to the September 6, 1939, Presidential directive

and the subsequent ones, "MIr. Nittle asked if he regarded the

directive as embracing within its terms a requirement that the

FBI also take charge of investigative work of subversive

activities generally. Mr. Maroney said that he thought it dia

generally direct the FBI: to take charge of investigation of sub-

versive activities and, "

...I think through the years what was

embraced through that condition was, in various exccutive orders,

and in other directives of the Attorney General relating to civil

disturbance matters." On page 3439, lit Maroney is reported to

have discussed investigations in the internal security area

conducted by the FBI. He stated that in connection with

particular investigations after a period of tine or after an

accumulation of information the FBI subnits the information

to the Department and the Department will give an opinion

as. to whether the facts constitute a prosecutable violation

and will also advise whether additional or continual investi

gation is requested. Maroney stated, "Sometimes it will be

Indicated "no further investigation is desired. However,

if any relevant future information comes to your attention,

please advise.'" Mr. Nittle then inquired if ir. Maroney

was telling him in effect that not only are these investigations

being conducted but that he construed the Attorney Gencral's

• directive to be a directive to the FBI to conduct broad,

• 7=

NW 54933 Docld:32989719- Page 77

## Page 78

on-going Investigations with respect to subversive activities.

Mr. Maroney replied that "he thought they (FBI) are under a con-

tinuing mandate of the Attorney General to continue

investigations of crines which include seditious conspiracy

anti-riot statutes and many other statutes.

3. In our position paper of July 31, 1972, the

conclusion was drawn that no additional investigative

authority was conveyed in the first paragraph of the

September 6, 1939, Presidential directive wherein the

FBI Was

s instructed to take charge of investigative work

In matters relating to espionage, sabotage, and violations

of the neutrality regulations. Since these were statutory

matters, the position was taken and, I feel correctly, that

this direction nerely fixed responsibility in the FBI to

Investigate previously

existing statutes. However, the

position paper did not take into consideration the possible

significance of the last paragraph of the directive wherein

the President called upon "all police officers, sheriffs,

and all other law enforcement officers in the United States

promptly to turn over to the nearest representative of the

Fedoral Bureau of Investigation any infornation obtained by.

then relating to esplonage, counterespionage, sabotage,

subversive activities and violations of the neutrality laws."

•.

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 78

## Page 79

• As noted hereinbefore, Mr. Hoover in his memorandum

of September 10, 1936,

wherein he explained that the rBI had

been charged with investigating subversive activities indicated

that the menorandum was classified strictly confidential.

On June 26, 1939, the President issued a directive

which was classified confidential. In it he stated, "It is my

desire that the investigation of all espionage, counterespionage

and sabotage matters be controlled and handled by the Federal

Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice, the Military

Intelligence Division of the Mar Department and the Office of

Naval Intelligence of the Mavy Department. The directors

of these three agencies are to function as a committee to

coordinate their activities." He went

on to point out that no

investigation should be conducted by any investigative agency

of the Government into matters involving actually or potentially

any espionage, counterespionage or sabotage except these

three agencies and the directive, which was issued to these heads

of all departments, stated that the President would be glad

if the heads of tho departments would instruct agencies other

than the three named to immediately refer to the nearest

office of the FBI any data, infommation or material relating

to these matters.

The directive of September 6, 1939, was not

classified. It was issued to the public. In it the President

said the Attorney General had been requested to instruct the

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 79

---

## Page 80

FBI to take charge of Investigative work in matters relating to

espionage, sabotage and violations of the neutrality regu-

lations. It was in this paragraph that the President

publicly fixed responsibility for investigative work with

respect to statutes relating to these three subject matters

in the FBI. However, in the third paragraph of the

September 6, 1939, directive the President stated, "To this

end I request all police officers, sheriffs and all other

law enforcement officers in the United States promptly to

turn over to the nearest representative of the Federal

Bureau of Invesigation any information obtained by them

relating to espionage, counterespionage, sabotage, subversive

activities and violations of the neutrality laws." It will

be noted that in this paragraph he referred specifically to

violations of three statues which he had enumerated in the

first paragraph but he also asked that there be turned over to

the FBI any information relating to countorespionage a word

which he had utilized in the confidential June 26, 1939,

directive and also the words subversive activities a phrase

which had been utilized by Mr. Hoover in explaining the

delegation of authority in Septenber, 1936.

• Mr. Hoover's nemorandum had been classified strictly confi-

dential and memoranda concerning his visits with President

Roosevelt and the Secretary of State which proceded the

Issuance of his September 10, 1936, memorandum revealed that

= 10 -

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 80

## Page 81

the President wanted this matter treated in the greatest

of confidence. Accordingly, there is the basis for a

strong conclusion that in 1936 and in June, 1939, under his

constitutional authority, the President had already delegated

responsibility to the FBI for investigations relating to

counterespionage and subversive activities in classified

directives. For this reason, the first paragraph of the

Septenter 6, 1939, directive did not include the delegation

of responsibilities for investigative work relating to

counterespionage and subversive activities because

of the

classified nature of these matters but there was"än

acknow-

ledgement in the third paragraph of the September 6, 1939,

directive of the previous delegation of authority to the FBI

by the president in these two areas..

FBI and the War and Navy Departments should function as a

committee to coordinate their activities with respect to

matters, Wannall requested the Research Section of the

Intelligence Division three weeks ago to undertake a study to

determine how this committce was formed and how it functioned

thereafter. The results of this study are set forth in the

On page Y of the attachment, it will be noted

that the Interdepartmental Intelligençe Conference (IIC)

was formed as an independent cormittee pursuant to the Presidential

directive of June 26, 1939, to coordinate the investigative

efforts of the three agencies. Io faciliate coordination, the

• IIC adopted the Delinitations Agrcement of June 5, 1940.

The nembers cited in the preamble of that document that in

conformity with that directive contained in the. Presidential

memorandum of June 26, 1939, as augumented by his directive

of September 6, 1939, charging them with Investigation of all

espionage, counterespionage, sabotage and subversive

activitios the responsibility for these investigations would

be delineated as contained in the agreement. The Delimi-

i tations

Agreement was revised on February 9, 1942, and again

on February 23, 1949.

As shown on page 9 of the attachment, the IIC as

an independent committee ceased to exist in 1949 as pursuant

to the National Security Act of 1947 it was absorbed and then

chartered by the lational Security Council presided over by

the President. In the charter, reference vas made to investi-

instructions to the FEI wherein the Attorney General was

indicated as the individual through whom the authority flowed

A reading of the enclosure will show that the IIC

was primarily concerned with matters of internal security

which had ramifications international in scope, However,

It should be noted that on November 1, 1950, an attempt was

made to kill President Truman by two members of the

Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico when they endeavored to

shoot their way into the Blair House which he was then

occupying. From a letter to Mr. Hoover as Chairman of the IIC

and Ir. Raymond P. Whearty, Chairman of the Interdepartmental

Cormittec on Internal Security, dated November 6, 1950, signed

by MI. J. Patrick Coyno, National Security Council Representa-

tive for Internal Security, It is apparent that the President

• 13 -

## Page 84

felt that both the IIC and ICIS had interests and respon-

sibilities in the domestic terrorist field, in light of the

fact that he, through the National Security Council, made

inquiry of the IIC regarding "the recent outbreak of violence

by the Puerto Rican Mationalists." The President requested

that the IIC and ICIS report to the

National Security Council

on the lessons to be learned from that incident on domestic

terrorism. Indicated by the detailed questions posed by the

president and. the detailed response given.by the IIC, it is

apparent that the President intended that IIC have great

Latitute in the area of subversive activities and terrorism

It relates to internal security matters assigned to the

IIC.

:

Keeping in mind that it was during the admini-

stration of president Truman and based upon racommendations

that he made that the Mational Security Act of 1947 was

passed, I feel that his request of the IIC for a report

regarding the activities of a purely domestic group, the

• Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico, provides an indication of

what he had in mind with respect to the responsibilities.

of the IIC with regard to investigation of subversive

activities.

I think this is well stated on page 14 of the enclosed

• document. "Nen do not opcrate in a vacuum and their acts and

documents are guided by their knowledge, Instructions and

-14 -

understanding of instructions at that time in history: The

delimitations agreement of 1940 must, therefore, speak to

existing problems and only the anticipation of future prob

lems. All prior knowledge and understanding of instructions

and orders could only have been interpreted to clearly

include investigation of United States citizens."

The foregoing information and the information con

tained in the attachments are supportive of the conclusion

that the intelligence-gathering activities of the FBI have had

as their basis the intention of the President to delegate his

Constitutional authority as indicated by certain Presidential

directives, the provisions of Title 28, Section 533, U.S. Coûe

and the provisions of the National Security Act of 1947. These

Intelligence-gathering activities are also based upon statutes

defining violations pertaining to the national security, a

list of which is attached hereto.

Synopsis;

Oral and written, confidential and public Directives of 1936 and

in June and September, 1939, ordered the FBI to investigate matters of internal

security, to include "subversive activities," and to coordinate such with the

military intelligence services. In compliance, the FBI and military.formed the

Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference (IIC) and delineated their areas of

investigative responsibility in the Delimitations Agreements of 1940, 1942, and

1949, basing their authority on the Presidential Directive of June 26, 1939, as

augmented by the Directive of September 6, 1939. The Delimitations Agreement

stated that the FBI will investigate matters affecting internal security, including

United States citizens. This authority for intelligence investigation was restated

and reaffirmed in 1949 when the National Security Council, presided over by

the President, chartered the IIC and adopted the Delimitations Agreement in

total. In 1962, the President assigned the internal security responsibility

to the Attorney General by National Security Action Memorandum 161. The

Attorney General rechartered the IIC pursuant to this authority and therein

reaffirmed the Directives by adoption in total of the Delimitations Agreement.

Pursuant to the Directives, the FBI has had continuous authority

to conduct intelligence investigations of internal activities which have potential

to subvert the ability of the Nation to maintain continuing existence under the

Constitution. (Emphasis Added) This authority has remained constant though

the nature of the threats has changed. As illustrated herein by use of examples,

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 88.

the original problem was global war and how internal subversion affected the

• war effort through actual or potential espionage and sabotage. This problem

continued through the Cold War to the present time. In more recent years, a

strictly domestic threat arose; riots, racial militants, hate groups, and terrorists.

Cognizant of the continuing authority for intelligence investigations, these

threats were faced by the FBI not only because of the immediate effect on the

national welfare or possible violation of statute but the evaluation of potential

for subversion during a national emergency.

This authority for intelligence investigation in the field of internal

security precipitated the dual role of the FBI as it exists today; (1) intelligence,

and (2) criminal investigations. This has been recognized by the Executive,

the Attorncy General, and the Congress.

In addition to the authority granted under the Directives, the FBI

has (1) a broad field of statutory authority, and (2) authority under Executive

Orders to investigate employee loyalty matters; neither of which is in any way

affected by the authority granted under the Directives.

In summary, the Directives granted intelligence authörity and

placed the FBI in an internal security intelligence posture, in addition to the

original statutory responsibility in the investigation of solely criminal matters.

AUTHORITY GRANTED TO THE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION BY THE

PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVES IN THE AREA OF

INTELLIGENCE AND INTERNAL SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS

AND SUBSEQUENT PERTINENT DOCUMENTS

I. Verbal Presidential instructions of August 24, 1936, and August 25, 1936:

Verbal instructions were given to Director John Edgar Hoover

by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on August 24, 1936, and August 25, 1936,

to investigate "subversive activities in the United States, including Fascism

and Communism," and "to coordinate any investigation along similar lines

which might be made by the Military or Naval Intelligence Services."

(Emphasis Added) President Roosevelt saw these activities "as international

in scope" and advised the Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, to request "such

investigation" under the Appropriations Act (Title 28, Section 533, United States

Code, which was done orally as the President wished the matter to be "handled

quite confidentially." President Roosevelt instructed Mr. Hoover and

Secretary Hull to speak with the Attorney General "upon his return to the city"

about this matter. The discussion of August 24 and 25, 1936, covered the

area of communist and fascist "movements" in the United States and President

Roosevelt was interested in obtaining "a broad picture" of the movement and

activities "as may affect the economic and political life of the country as a

whole." (Confidential momoranda, John Edgar Hoover, dated August 24,

1936 and August 25, 1936.)

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 90

---

## Page 91

On September 10, 1936, Mr. Hoover advised the Attorney General

regarding "the radical situation" and his conference with the President

and Secretary of State, wherein he acted as the representative of the

Department of Justice, and wherein the request was made "to have investi-

gation made of the subversive activities in this country, including

Communism and Fascism." (Emphasis Added) The Attorney General

orally directed Mr. Hoover to "proceed with this investigation and to

coordinate, as the President suggested, information upon these matters in

the possession of the Military Intelligence Division, Naval Intelligence

• Division, and the State Department. This, therefore, is the authority upon

which to proceed in the conduct of this investigation, which should, of

course, be hanäled in a most discreet and confidential manner." (Memorandum

for Mr. Tamm, strictly confidential, from John Edgar Hoover, dated

September 10, 1936.) *

It is noted and emphasized that, throughout the memoranda,

Mr. Hoover referred on a recurring basis to "subversive activities, in-

cluding communism and fascism" and the overall gist of the conversations

as reflected in the memoranda demands the understanding that this

authority was granted for a widespread and diverse look at all subversive

activities within the United States. It should not be overlooked that the

United States was then on the brink of global war and, of necessity,

information regarding subversive activities of all manner were of vital

importance to the President and Scerctary of State.

il.

The Presidential Directive of June 26, 1939, a confidential Directive:

"It is my desire that the investigation of

all espionage, counterespionage, and sabotage

matters be controlled and handled by the

Federal Bureau of Investigation of the

Department of Justice, the Military Intel-

ligence Division of the War Department, and

the Office of Naval Intelligence of the Navy

Department. The directors of these three

agencies are to function as a committee to

coordinate their activities.

No investigations should be conducted by

any investigative agency of the Government into

matters involving actually or potentially any

espionage, counterespionage, or sabotage,

except by the three agencies mentioned above.

I shall be glad if you will instruct the heads

of all other investigative agencies than the three

named, to refer immediately to the nearest office

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation any data,

information, or matcrial that may come to their

notice bearing directly or indirectly on espionage,.

counterespionage, or sabotage." (Emphasis Added)

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 92

---

## Page 93

In the Presidential Dircctive of June. 26, 1939, President

Roosevelt clearly and uncquivocably ordered that "the investigation of all

espionage, counterespionage, sabotage matters" be handled by the Federal

Bureau of Investigation, Military Intelligence Division (MID), and Office of

Naval Intelligence (ONI) and that their directors were to act as committee

to coordinate their activities. This is unquestionably delegation of investi-

gative authority for Bureau investigations of the enumerated areas of activity

to the exclusion of other agencies, save the MID and ÖNI. In the second

paragraph, the Directive also clearly and unequivocably. states the President's

intent to have investigation made of actual or potential espionage, counter-

espionage or sabotage as he directs no other agency to enter the field of

actual or potential espionage, counterespionage or sabotage investigations.

(Emphasis Added) On the contrary, in paragraph three, he directs other

agencies to "refer immediately" to the FBI any data, information or material

bearing directly or indirectly on espionage, counterespionage, or sabotage.

If such matters are to be referred to the FBI, the President's intent obviously

is that he desired the FBI to "control and handle" the correlation of such

material as reflected in paragraph one of the Directive and as he had pre-

viously verbally instructed Mr. Hoover to do in 1936, in other words, to

coordinate any investigation with the military.

Reflecting back to the verbal Directives of August, 1936, as

compared to the Prosidential Directive of June 26, 1939, it is noted that tio

major premises can be made, one being the intent of the President for the

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 93

---

## Page 94

FBI to investigate "subversive activity, including Communism and Fascism,"

an area of concern akin to and overlapping in many respects the area of

espionage, counterespionage, and sabotage; and secondly, his intent that

the FBI and Military Services coordinate their efforts of investigation as

assigned by these Directives. Emphasis Added)

IlI. The Presidential Directive of September 6, 1939, a public Directive:

"The Attorney General has been requested by me

to instruct the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the

Department of Justice, to take charge of investigative

work in matters relating to espionage, sabotage, and

violations of the neutrality regulations.

This task must be conducted in a comprehensive

". and effective manner on a national basis, and all

information must be carefully sifted out and correlated

in order to avoid confusion and irresponsibility.

To this end I request all police officers, sheriffs,

and all other law enforcement officers in the United States

promptly to turn over to the nearest representative öf the

Federal Bureau of Investigation any information obtained

by them relating to espionage, counterespionage, sabotage,

subversive activities and violations of the neutrality

laws."

(Emphasis Added)

- 5 -

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 94

## Page 95

Interpreting the Presidential intent in this Directive, a public

document, it must be first noted that in the first sentence the President states

"the Attorney General has been requested by me to instruct the Federal Pureau

of Investigation of the Department of Justice to take charge of investigative

work in matters relating to espionage, sabotage, and violations of the neutrality

regulations." (Emphasis Added) The use of the past tense requires one to

understand that the President, through prior instructions and Directives,

oral or written, had, to his own satisfaction, specifically delegated responsi-

bility for these investigations. The President restates publicly the need for

handling of these matters comprehensively and on "a national basis." He

restates matters previously covered in verbal and written form by expressing

his desire to have the information "sifted out and correlated." One need only

refer to the verbal instructions of 1936 and the confidential Presidential

Directive of June 26, 1939, to clearly see that the main intent of the President

is here again reflected, only in this instance, publicly, and with an appeal for

assistance from law officers.

Further, and a point believed worthy of note, the President

instructs in this Directive that law officers in the United States remand to

the FBI information relating to espionage, counterespionage, sabotage,

subversive activities, and violations of the neutrality laws.

Emphasis

Added) Carefully note that the President included in this request that.

information regarding subversive activities be turned over to the FBI as

- 6-

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 95

## Page 96

:

well as information involving espionage, counterespionage, sabotage, and

violations of the neutrality laws. This is the precise language of the verbal

Directive or instruction of August, 1936, and it is logical that if the President

instructed Mr. Hoover to investigate subversive activities in 1936, he would

desire that information regarding subversive activities be furnished to the FBI

by law officers in his public Directive of September 6, 1939, in order to

increase and enhance the tempo of incoming information regarding subversive

activities in which he had a grave interest. (Emphasis Added)

IV. The Presidential Directives of January 8, 1943, July 24, 1950, and December 15,

1953, in main, restate and reaffirm these basic instructions and orders based

on then current developments at the time of their respective issuances.

V. How has the FBI complied with the verbal instructions of August, 1936, and

confidential Presidential Directive of June 26, 1939, as augmented by his

Directive of September 6, 1939, and what other Presidential documents reaffirm

subsequent Presidential approval of this investigative authority?

A. Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference (IC):

The Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference (IC) was formed

as an independent committee pursuant to the Presidential Directive of June 26,

1939, to coordinate the investigative efforts of the FBI, MID, and ONI. To

facilitate coordination, the IIC adopted the Dclimitations Agreement of June 5,

1940. The members cited in the preamble of that document that in conformity

with the Directive contained in the Presidential Memorandum of June 26, 1939,

-7-

is

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 96™

## Page 97

as augmented by his Directive of September 6, 1939, charging them with

investigation of all espionage, counterespionage, sabotage, and subversive

activities, that responsibility for these investigations would be delineated

as contained in the Agreement. (Emphasis Added)

It is apparent that the members of IIC recognized their authority

from the Presidential Memorandum of June 26, 1939, and that their duty

under that Directive was to investigate the aforementioned areas, including

subversive activities, as Mr . Hoover had been directed to do in August, 1936.

(Emphasis Added)

The IIC in issuing the revised Delimitations Agreement of February 9,

1942, again cited the Presidential Directive of June 26, 1939, as augmented by

the Directive of September 6, 1939', as authority. IC members stated in the

preamble that investigative responsibility of IIC extended to "all activities

coming under the categories of espionage, counterespionage, subversion,

and sabotage." (Emphasis Added)

The Agreement was redrafted in the Delimitations Agreement of

February 23, 1949, and again the members in the preamble cited the

Presidential Directive of June 26, 1939, as augmented by his Directive of

September 6, 1939, the Delimitations Agreement of February 9, 1942, and the

Presidential Directive of October 30, 1947 (pertaining to employee loyalty

investigations), as authority. As before, the IIC members referred specifically

to the delincation of responsibility of investigation of "all activities coming

undci the categorics of espionage, countcrespionage, subversion, and sabotage."

(Emphasis Addcd)

B.

IIC under the charter of the National Security Council (NSC):

The IIC as an independent committee ceased to exist in 1949, as

pursuant to the National Security Act of 1947 it was absorbed and then chartered

by the NSC, presided over the President. The Council chartered both the IIC

and the Interdepartmental Committee on Internal Security (CIS), which consisted

of representatives of the Departments of State, Treasury, and Justice, and the

Military Establishments. * The IIC charter issued by NSC dated July 18, 1949,

## Page 101

It is apparent that all authority granted by NSC and the Attorney

General subsequent to the Presidential Directives of August 24-25, 1936, and

June 26, 1939, which authorized the FBI to conduct intelligence investigations

refers to those Directives and recognizes, adopts and reaffirms their instruction.

D.

What are the primary areas of inguiry considered by HIC in fulfilling

their responsibility? Do they include United States citizens?

A review of the voluminous files relative to IIC reflects that the

primary considerations of IIC were directed at such matters as security of

plants, protection of industry and transportation; obstruction of commerce and

vital utilities, registry of boats, security of wharfs and docks, public radio

broadcasting, alien entry and control matters, diplomatic establishment

radio authorizations, visiting foreign nationals, Communist Party, USA,

and alien seamen, to mention but a few.

Obviously, the IIC was primarily concerned with matters of

internal security which had ramifications "international' in scope," as

President Roosevelt described previously herein, and this is only natural

as these were the primary problems during the heat of the Cold War of the

late 1940's to the mid-1960's. These problems continue today. Domestic

terrorism was not a problem in this country at the time, except on a very

limited basis. Mr. Hoover, when preparing proposals for the Delimitations

Agreement of June 5, 1940, suggested to the members that "subversive

• activity" be understood to include "espionage, sabotage, groups organized

to assist hostile forces ("Fifth Column") and Subversive propaganda, " all

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 101

---

## Page 102

• :

which ard matters obviously pertinent to internal security challenges from

without the Nation's boundries. One primary consideration cannot be lost,

however, and that is the central fact that from the earliest verbal instructions

• in 1936 through and including all other orders, the FBl, without reservation,

has been directed to "investigate," "take charge," "correlate," "sift out,"

"control," and "handle," all intelligence matters concerning the internal

security of the United States whether it be called "subversive activities,"

"subversion," "domestic espionage," "espionage," "counterespionage,"

"sabotage," or "subversion and other related intelligence matters affecting

internal security." (Emphasis Added) Secondly, and of primary importance,

is the fact that the thrust of these investigations as ordered by the various

Directives and charters has not been limited to the alien principle or agent

operating in the United States but directed at the United States citizen when

he or she acts or functions in a manner to fall within the above terms used to

indicate a threat to the internal security. Supporting this fact is the Delimitations

Agreement of June 5, 1940, wherein the members, conforming with the Presidential

Directive of June 26, 1939, as they so state, outline their respective areas of

responsibility to investigate. Item 2 of this Agreement reads in part:

"II. FBI will assume responsibility for all

investigations of cases in these categories involving

civilians in the United States and in its territories

with the exception of the Panama Canal Zonc, Guam,

Samon and the Philippine Islands."

(Emphasis Added)

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 102

---

## Page 103

Men do not operate in vacuum and their acts and documents are

guided by their knowledge, instructions, and understanding of instructions

at that time in history. The Delimitations Agreement of 1940 must, therefore,

speak to existing problems and only the anticipation of future problems. All

prior knowledge and understanding of instructions and orders could only have

been interpreted to clearly include investigation of United States citizens since

Item 2 of the Agreement speaks so specifically to this point.

1. Has the Executive adopted Item 2 as set forth in the Delimitations

Agreement of 1940?

Absolutely. The Delimitations Agreement of 1940 was replaced by

the Delimitations Agreement of February 9, 1942, wherein reference for authority

is again based on a Presidential Directive of June 26, 1939, and Item 2 is

changed in language but not in meaning. Item 2 reads in part:

"II. FBI will be responsible for:

1. All investigation of cases in the

categories involving civilians in the

United States and its territories with

the exception of the Republic of Panama,

the Panama Canal Zone, Guam, American

Samoas, Palmyra, Johnston, Wake and

Midway Islands, the Philippine Islands

and the Tcrritory of Alaska other than

that spocifically described in Paragraph III."

(Emphasis Added)

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 103

## Page 104

..

The IIC issued the Delimitations Agreement of February 23, 1949,

again basing authority on the Presidential Directive of June 26, 1939, and

again restated the position to investigate United States citizens; which is

clearly stated in Item 2, which reads in part:

"II. FBI will be responsible for:

1. All investigations of cases in these

categories involving civilians and foreign

nationals of all classes in the continental

United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin

Islands, (the State of Hawaii), and the State

of Alaska except as specifically described

hereinafter in Paragraph V, Section 5."

The Delimitations Agreement of February 23, 1949, was in effect

on July 18, 1949, when the IIC was chartered by the NSC. The President was

Chairman of the NSC. The NSC charter to IIC reads in part:

"D. Nothing herein shall be construed as

modifying or affecting the Presidential Directives

issued to the members of the IIC relating to their

individual responsibilities and duties. The

Delimitations Agrement among the members of the

IIC relating to the investigative responsibilities and

to be amended, changed, and supplemented at the

discretion of the IIC." (Emphasis Added)

The President herein clearly adopted the language of the Delimitations

Agreement of February 23, 1949, to include Item 2 of that Agreement, wherein

it is specifically stated the FBI will investigate United States citizens.

2. Does this adoption apply to the charter issued by the

Attorney General in 1964?

Yes. Pursuant to the authority of the National Security Action

Memorandum 161, dated June 9, 1962, from the President, the Attorney General

chartered the IIC and that charter reads in part:

". "D. Nothing herein shall be construed as

modifying or affecting the Presidential Directives

Delimitations Agreement among the members of the

IC relating to the investigative responsibilities and:

In summary, the Executive has, over the years, granted continuing

authority to the FBI to investigate matters threatening the internal security, including

investigation of private citizens of the United States and their activities.

VI. What Other Areas of Intelligence Investigation Have Been Recognized By

the Executive to Fall Within the Jurisdiction Delineated By the Directives?

Examination of the question illustrates that over the years the

scope of internal security problems has been expanded from the nriginal

category of "subversive activities" as described by Mr. Hoover in

his proposed definition of the term to a much broader field of intelligence

responsibility. It has been illustrated that the oral and written Directives

of 1936 and 1939 vested intelligence investigative authority in the FBI and that

this authority has been reaffirmed over the years. The authority was granted

originally to meet the problems of the 1936-1939 period and has continued

in effect to meet. the problems involving internal security as they arose in

subsequent years.

Originally, the problem facing the Nation was obviously the threat

of communist and fascist espionage, sabotage, and subversive activities, acts

such as infiltration of vital functions, dissemination of propaganda, and fostering

discontent that would weaken the national fabric at a time when the Nation was

faced with global war. These concerns have grown and evolved over the years

to include domestic "hate groups," anarchists, and terrorists. The following

chronology illustrates this evolutionary aspect of the recognized problem:

- 17 -

By letter to Mr. Hoover, Chairman, IIC, and Mr. Whearty, Chairman,

•ICIS, dated November 6, 1950, from Mr. J. Patrick Coyne, NSC Representative

on Internal Security, it is apparent that the President felt that the IC and the

ICIS had interests and responsibilities in the domestic terrorist field in light

of the fact that he, through the NSC, made inquiry of the IIC regarding the

then recent Presidential attack by Puerto Rican nationalists. The President

requested that the IIC and the ICIS report to the NSC on the lessons to be learned

from that incident of domestic terrorism (see App. Section I). As indicated

by the detailed questions posed by the President and the detailed response by

the IIC, it is apparent that the President intended that IIC have great latitude

in the area of investigation of subversive activity and terrorism as it relates to

internal security matters assigned to IIC.

It should be obvious that the concern of the President and referral

of this concern to the IIC and ICIS for answers affirms and illustrates the

President's atritude that such matters as domestic terrorism certainly affect,

the internal security and national welfare and are the responsibility of IlC.

The FBI is the member of IIC charged with investigation of "subversion" under

the Delimitations Agreement of February 23, 1949. What more subversive activity

could be imagined than an armed terrorist attack on the President?

In a report to the NSC on the status of the internal security program

dated March 5, 1954, prepared jointly by the IIC and the ICIS, the scope of

intelligence investigation of internal security matte's was described in connection

with outlining specific major goals of the program:

in

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 107

10

---

## Page 108

"1. To coordinate the activities of all agencies and

and departments concerned with internal security matters,

including investigations, the collection of domestic

intelligence, and the integration of foreign intelligence

pertinent to the domestic intelligence field.

2. To continue the acceleration of investigations

designed to provide the basis for the apprehension,

prosecution, or other action, against persons involved

in subversive activities.

3. To detect and maintain security indices on

persons considered dangerous to the national defense

and public safety.

4. To neutralize Communist front and Communist-

dominated organizations of the United States."

It may be seen that in addition to their interests in prosecuting

statutory violations, the IIC members recognize their responsibility as assigned

by the Directives to obtain a broad-based intelligence picture regarding the

subversive potential of individuals and organizations.

In a joint status report to the NSC dated August 27, 1958, the IC

and ICIS discussed the dual aspects of their jurisdiction. It is pointed out

that there is occasional conflicts between the prosecutive jurisdiction under

statutes which might tend to interfcre with the intelligence-gathering function.

- 19 -

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 108

---

## Page 109

In such cases, it was noted that prosecution is frequently foregone in favor

of the more valuable collection of intelligence. The report states in part:

"Following the Supreme Court decisions reversing

the convictions of 19 Communist Party leaders for

violation of the Smith Act of 1940, action by various

Circuit Courts of Appeal has resulted in the acquittal

• of 20 additional Communist Party functionaries and

the remanding for retrial of 29 others. While selected

cases are not scheduled for retrial during the fiscal

year 1959, problems have arisen in other cases due

to the lapse of time since the periods covered by the

indictments. In most instances, several years have

been consumed by trials and appeals with the result

that witnesses have died, have become invalid, or

are unavailable for other reasons and at this late date

their testimony cannot be replaced. Another problem

has been the stringent evidentiary standards established

by the Supreme Court in the case of the California

communist leaders.

In other cases, the Department of Justice must

consider the loss, through their appearance as witnesses,

of additional confidential informants of the FBI. It

is necessary to weigh the difficulty of developing

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 109

---

## Page 110

:

informants within the Communist Party and its related

groups together with the value of the information they

secure against the benefit to be derived from using

such persons as witnesses."

On November 6, 1958, former Director Hoover gave a presentation

to the President and the Cabinet, which reads in part:

"We have still a sixth program under which we

..

continuously evaluate the espionage and sabotage

potential of individuals whose current activities

indicate that they might constitute a threat to the

country in the event of a national emergency. These

include members of the Communist Party of the

United States and other individuals dedicated to

the violent overthrow of our Government. We.

maintain a special index of such persons to enable

us to effect their immediate apprehension in the event

the President so directs the Attorney General. For

your information, there were 12,835 names on this

index.

Communist Party Icaders are hopeful that, by

exploiting such current national and international

issues as racial discrimination and peace, they can

- 21 -

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 110

---

## Page 111

bring about a resurgence of Party activity and influence.

For example, Benjamin Davis, chairman of the Party's

New York District, in a report made in September of

this year to top communist functionaries, stressed

that the Party should concentrate on the integration

issue as symbolized by the Little Rock school situation.

Diligent efforts are made by the communists to infiltrate

Negro groups, particularly at the local level, so as

to agitate and create confusion.

The public usually associates the FBI's internal

security investigations with Communist Party activities

only. Nothing could be further from the truth. Our

investigations encompass any and all organizations based

on a creed of force and violence to determine whether they

are a threat to our internal security or whether they have

violated any Federal laws.

We investigate the activities of such diverse and

international organizations as the Marxist Socialist

Workers Party, and the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico.

(Responsible for attack upon President Truman,

1950, and Congress, 1951.) Further, we investi-

gate such fanatical and so-called 'hate' groups as

the Negro Nation of Islam; the Ku Klus Klan; the

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 111

---

## Page 112

National States Rights Party, an anti-Jewish and anti-

Negro organization; and the 'Confederate Underground.'

The latter is a name which has been mentioned on

a number of occasions in recent bombing threats and other

forms of violence.

Since January 1, 1957, there have been over 90

' bombings, or attempted bombings, in the United States.

Of these, at least 69 have involved Negro victims and at

least eight, Jewish religious and educational facilities.

In the early bombings there was no evidence to show

that these bombings could be attributable to specific

organizations. Rather, they were individual acts of

terror strictly within the jurisdiction of local authorities.

When these outrages occurred, we in the FBI have made

immediately available to local authorities our laboratory

and fingerprint facilities here in Washington.

As the bombings directed toward religious and".

educational facilities continued, the FBI extended its

cooperation to cover out-of-state leads which local

authorities could not handle.

We extended such

assistance to the Jacksonville, Florida, and Birmingham,

Alabama, Police Departments in conncction with the

- 23-

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 112

---

## Page 113

bombings of a Jcwish center and a Negro high school

in Jacksonville on April 28, 1958, and the attempted

bombing of a Jewish temple in Birmingham on the

same day.

Recently, however, there has been some indication

of a general interstate pattern to these bombings. For

example, one of the men indicted on October 17, 1958,

(Richard Bowling) for the bombing of the Jewish temple

in Atlanta, received from one of his fellow conspirators

two checks amounting to $200. One of these checks

was dated October 4, 1958, the day before the Clinton,

Tennessee, High School bombing, the other, October 9,

1958, three days before the Atlanta temple bombing.

Recognizing the danger to the national welfare from

a general pattern of organized terrorism, the FBI has moved

to expand its assistance to local law enforcement in the

recent bombings at Clinton, Atlanta, and Peoria, Illinois.

We are now providing all-out investigative assistance

in these cases. We are closely checking the activities

of individuals prominently involved in racial disturbances,

such as the notorious John Kasper, the executive

secretary of the Seaboard White Citizens Council of

Washington. As a further aid to local law enforcement

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 - Page 113

---

## Page 114

:

agencies, the FBI has schoduled a series of special

conferences for November and December, 1958, to

discuss our cooperative services regarding bombings

and threats of bombings against religious and educational

institutions.

Our entry into these cases at this new level is not to

• be interpreted as an attempt on our part to usurp the

jurisdiction of local authorities. To give the FBI this

jurisdiction would relieve local governments of the

basic responsibility to maintain law and order, and

the ultimate responsibility rightfully rests at the local

level."

As specifically stated by Mr. Hoover in his comments to the President

and the Cabinet, he therein delineates that there is an internal domestic aspect

to the intelligence-gathering function of the FBI and this is based on the fact that

he recognizes the danger to the "national welfare" from a general pattern of

terrorisin which does, in fact, affect the internal security of the United States.

By letter of May 17, 1961, McGeorge Bundy, Special Assistant to

the President, requested of the IIC and the ICIS, pursuant to Presidential wishes,

reports covering current and contemplated internal security programs which fall

within the cognizance of their respective committces. The reports were to

include such items as: description of the program and its objcctives, the

- 25 -

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 114

---

## Page 115

datc of initiation, reference to the Directive or other authority pursuant to

which the program was undertaken, highlights of the results achieved and

significant problems encountered, to name but a few.

Pursuant to this request, Mr. Bundy was furnished by letter of

July 25, 1961, a copy of the IIC status report dated July 25, 1961, wherein

he was advised in part as follows:

"I. IDENTIFICATION AND INVESTIGATION OF POTENTIALLY

DANGEROUS PERSONS IN THE UNITED STATES*

The FBI maintains a current list of individuals, both

citizens and aliens, to be considered for apprehension

and detention, if necessary, in a period of emergency.

Approximately 12,000 individuals are listed at this time.

This list is kept current on a daily basis by the addition

of new individuals whose activities make. them potentially

dangerous to the United States, and by the deletion of

individuals who are no longer engaged in subversive

activities. Included on the list of potentially dangerous

individuals are nearly 200 persons who are engaged in

pro-Castro Cuban activities or who sympathize strongly

with such activities. In addition to members of the

Communist Party, it also includes certain members of such

organizations as the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico, the

Nation of Islam, and the Socialist Workers Party."

*Sce Appendix for additional information concerning Emergency Detention Law

NW 54933 Docld:32989719• Page 115

---

## Page 116

As indicated in the last sentence, from information furnished to the

President, it is apparent that the problem area being discussed included not only

members of the Communist Party and their apparent capability of action in the

field of sabotage and espionage during an outbreak of war but also such organi-

zations as the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico, Nation of Islam, and the

Socialist Workers Party, organizations whose potential for internal disruption

in time of emergency is the matter in question.

In further illustration of this point, on May 11, 1961, former

Director Hoover submitted a memorandum to top Bureau officials, wherein

he described a presentation to the President concerning the FBI's intensifi-

cation of its coverage of Cubans in this country, both anti-Castro groups

and pro-Castro groups. During an NSC meeting on April 27, 1961, it is

apparent that the thought in the minds of the men discussing this matter

extended not only to the possibility of espionage and sabotage activities of the

pro-Castro groups discussed but the possibility that the anti-Castro groups

discussed might well be involved in activities which would involve terrorism

or violence of a domestic nature.

• As previously noted, in 1962, the supervision of the IIC and the

overall responsibility for the internal security programs of the United States

passed by National Security Action Memorandum 161 to the Attorney General..

From that date to the present time, the FBI has received on a case-by-case

basis specific instructions from the Attorney General regarding investigative

- 27-.

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 116

Far,

---

## Page 117

matters pertinent to the delegation of intelligence investigation authority in

numerous areas involving individuals or organizations which advocate violence

or the denial of rights of others.

Let us pause to summarize the position of the FBI at this time in

history.

The Directives cast the FBI in an intelligence-gathering posture

which was recögnized by the Governmeat as a body and the American public.

As herein indicated by the previous examples, the FBI gradually came to be

assigned intelligence investigations outside the foreign controlled espionage

and sabotage matters and into an area of intelligence investigations regarding

"other intelligence matters affecting the internal security," to wit; Puerto Rican

nationalists, anti-Castro

groups, Nation of Islam, Socialist Workers Party,

"hate groups," and others advocating the violent overthrow of the Government

or who could, on reasonable belief, cause disruption of the "national welfare"

and in time of emergency, be of assistance to foreign powers. These matters

were automically referred to the FBI because we had been cast in the "intelligence

posture" as a direct result of the Presidential Directives coupled with the fact

that the FBI has statutory investigative jurisdiction of the criminal violations in

the general area of internal security: Our position had become twofold:

(1) intelligence gathering in the area of internal security and (2) investigation

of criminal statutory violations, both in the internal security arca.

in

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 117

- 28 -

---

## Page 118

During the turbulent 1960's, Executive concern for the internal

security and national welfare naturally increased due to campus riots, racial

unrest, militant groups who ambushed police and bombed, the increase of

activity of "hate groups," both "far right and left," and the open advocacy

of entirely domestic groups to overthrow the Constitution and Government of

this Nation. Because of the intelligence criminal investigative posture of the

FBI in the internal security field, the inquiries and orders were naturally

directed to the FBI. We responded because we had come to recognize and operate

within our dual posture of intelligence and criminal investigation.

Can we illustrate how this dual posture was magnified and

expanded since the 1950's and early 1960's?

Clear evidence exists that past Presidents and Attorneys General

:

have assumed the FBI's intelligence-gathering authority.

For example, by memorandum dated April 28, 1965, to Bureau

officials, former FBI Director Hoover recounted a conversation with the laté

President Lyndon B. Johnson, which occurred on that date, during which

Johnson expressed profound concern that his military and foreign policy

with respect to Vietnam was being undermined by anti-war agitation in

the United States, particularly on the college campuses. The memorandum

of former Director Hoover noted that, during their conversation, he informed

the President of FBI information concerning forthcoming demonstrations and

instructed that a memorandum be prepared for President Johnson concerning

the Students For a Democratic Society.

sai

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 118

---

## Page 119

Further, by letter of September 14, 1967, the Attorney General,

Ramsey Clark, obviously concerned with recent riots of that period, directed

a letter to the FBI, wherein he instructed that the FBI conduct investigation to

determine whether there was an organization which made advance plans for

and was

active during any of the riots in the Summer of 1967. He pointed out

that, in view of the seriousness of the riot activity across the country, it is

most important that the FBI use the maximum available resources, investigative

and intelligence, to collect and report all facts bearing upon the question

as to whether there was scheme or conspiracy. He enumerated various criminal

statutes, which he pointed out should be considered if prosecution was a

possibility based on the investigation but clearly recognized the intelligence-

gathering role of the FBI.

:

To 'further illustrate, reference is made to the Attorney General's

letter to Director, FBI, dated February 18, 1969, wherein he requests broad-

scoped and comprehensive investigation of the Students For a Democratic Society

in relation to the illegal and violent campus disorders of that period. (For

Details, See Appendix.)

It must be recalled that, pursuant to the National Security Action

Memorandum 161, the President had assigned to the Attorney General the

responsibility of the internal security in 1.962. As illustrated, no more broad

instruction for intelligence investigation could have been phrased. These letter's

clearly iccognizc the dual function of the FBI in its intelligence-gathering

role and in its criminal investigative rolo.

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 119

---

## Page 120

Further evidence of the recognition of the dual role of the Ecderal

Bureau of Investigation is illustrated by reference to the Intelligence Evaluation

Committee (IEC). Based on the President's need to know, Presidential

representatives, Attorney General representatives, and others, on or about

December 17, 1970, formed this Committee with the purpose of obtaining reports

and information concerning militant terrorist groups operating within the

United States. This was for a dual necessity, its efféct on the internal national

welfare and how such activity might affect the foreign policy and war effort.

This Committee, composed of members of the Executive, pursuant to their

authority under the Interdepartmental Action Plan for Civil Disturbances,

a plan for the Executive to meet emergencies, requested through the Attorney

General that reports and intelligence information be furnished to the Committee

for the benefit of the Executive. This is another graphic illustration of how the

Executive has relied on the intelligence function of the FBI.

In summary, the FBI has had authorization and approval of the

President and Attorney General to investigate matters concerning internal security

since the verbal instructions of August, 1936, the Presidential Directive of

June 26, 1939, as augmented by the Presidential Directive of September 6, 1939,

down to and including the charters by the NSC and the Attorney General. The

FBI has conducted these intelligence investigations under the scrutiny of the

Executive Branch as herein indicated.

NW 54933 Docld:32989719. Page 120

= 31 -

---

## Page 121

VII. Has Congress Recognized the Dual Intelligence--Criminal Role of the FBI Which

Results From the Directives?

Absolutely. On November 30, 1939, some 85 days after the public

Directive of September 6, 1939, former Director Hoover appeared before Congress

as reflected in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill of 1940

testimony wherein he states that in September, 1939, the General Intelligence

Division was organized based on the Presidential proclamation that all complaints

regarding violation of the National defense statutes be referred to the FBI. He

described in his testimony that the function of the Intelligence Division was to

"compile extensive indices of individuals, groups, and organizations engaged

in these subversive activities, in espionage activities, or any activities that are

possibly detrimental to the internal security of the United States." (Emphasis Added)

Again, in testimony under Justice Department Appropriation Bill

of 1941, former Director Hoover specifically cites verbatim the Presidential

Directive of September 6, 1939, the public Directive not the confidential

Directive of June 26, 1939, and thereafter in narrative describes the general

intelligence activities of the Bureau, the coordination system between the FBI

and military intelligence services, plant protection, and the opening of ten

added offices to handle the volume of work in the intelligence field. Further

testimony was furnished on June 6, 1940, with reference to the Supplemental

National Defense Appropriations Bill of 1941 and such testimony has continued

in subsequent years to the present, each time setting forth the specific areas of

intelligence investigations. This testimony includes, for example in the 1973

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 121

---

## Page 122

=..•

VIII.

appropriations testimony, information regarding investigations of New Left

terrorism, antiwar demonstrations, student agitation, Communist Party, USA,

Socialist Workers Party, Progressive Labor Party, racial extremism, Black

Panther Party , Student National Coordinating Committee, Junta of Militant

Organizations, extremism in penal institutions, Klan-type organizations, urban

guerrilla warfare, bombing matters, espionage and counterintelligence to

mention only the work done by the Bureau in the intelligence field.

In addition, voluminous intelligence information has been furnished

to investigative committees of the Congress regarding internal security matters

and at no time did Congress, having been advised as above, offer objection by

means of legislation or enactment to the intelligence field of investigation.

Do the Directives in Any Way Alter the FBI's Jurisdiction as Assigned By Statute

: or Other Executive Order?

Nothing herein alters the FBI's basic responsibility assigned by

the Attorney General under Title 18, Section 533, U. S. Code, to investigate

statutory violations which are the mandate of Congress and specific Executive

Orders of the President relative to employee loyalty matters.

IX. What Effcct Would Be Realized If the FBI Had Not Had the Directives "ór..

If the Directives Were Revoked?

The effect of the Presidential Directives of August, 1936, and June 26,

• and September 6, 1939, is to place the FBI in an affirmative intelligenec-gathering

posture. The FBI overtly secks intelligence information in the internal security

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 122

- 33 -

---

## Page 123

field based on the Directives:

Should they be nonexistent or revoked, the FBI

would be placed in a position of merely investigating violations of statutes. Investi-

gation would commence only at a point where some set of facts would indicate a

"strong suspicion," "reasonable grounds to believe," or "probable cause" that

a violation of law was about to be or had been committed and a person or group of

people committed it, i.e., no overt, offensive search for intelligence information

in the internal security field regardless of lack of specific statutory violation.

In summary, the question should be not one of whether the FBI has

authority to conduct intelligence investigations, this has.been herein reflected,

but whether the FBI has acted reasonably under that authority.

Compare, if you will, the FBI Agent who, having lawful probable cause

to search for three large stolen television sets, obtains a search warrant, valid

on its face, for a residence and thereby enters and conducts a search pursuant.

to the warrant. He is lawfully and with authority in the residence but while

there searches a small drawer in a desk, where no television set could possibly

be secreted. Narcotics are found. Are they admissible? No. The search is

"unreasonable" under Fourth Amendment standards as it pertains to the narcotics,

however, this in no way effects the Agent's lawful presence in the residence

under the authority of the warrant.

This is analogous of the situation in which the FBI finds itself today.

The FBI has the authority to be in the intelligence field under the Directives,

however, will be challenged as to the rcasonableness of its activitics and conduct

in the field. (Emphasis Added)

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 123

---

## Page 124

The FBI has over the years limited the boundaries of this authority

on its own with minimal guidance from the Executive and the Attorney General. In

most instances this self-limiting has been more to restriction than liberalism. If

outside challenge is made to the FBI's conduct to date, it should be properly

addressed to the limits and boundaries of our activities, not the authority itself.

On January 30, 1933, Adoll Hitler became

Chancellor of Germany.

On March 10, 1935, Hltler rejected the Versailles

Treaty and ordered conscription in Germany.

On March 7, 1936, reoccupation of the demilitarized

Rhineland Zone (a violation of the Locarho Ireaty) was

begun by German troops.

In March, 1937, the German army under Hitler

invaded Austria.

In the "Munich" conference of September, 1938,

Bavaria, Britain, and France agreed to Hitler's demands

and Czechoslovakia ceded to Germany Sudetenland.

May 7, 1939, Germany and Italy announced a

military alliance.

In August, 1939, a nonaggression pact between

CONFIDENTIAL MNORANDUM

ROOSEVELT,

This morning, in accordance with the request of the President

conveyed to me personally by hin last Wednesday in New York City, I called

at the thite House aù 9:15 and was with the President unüil 10:15.

He was desirous of discussing the question of the subversive

activities in the United States, particularly Fascism and Comünise. He

had previously received the nenorandun hich I had prepared covering ay

• conversation vith General Smedley Butler and the effort of Iator Coughlin

to have Genoral Butler head an expedition to Mexico. I incornoù tha President

concerning certain recent developmenis in ina Commnist activivies in ac

country, particulerly the eiforts of the Bridges organization in San Fran-

cisco and their progressive control of the shipping on the Pacific Coast,

: the Guli Coast and weir recent expansion to shipping opecations on te

Atlantic Coast. i told hin that while their contract vill expire on

September 30, 1936, thoj are endeavoring to have it temporarily extenica

until April 1, 1937, in ordes to concorn do the same date that the Uniteu

Mine Workers' contract expires, veich organization is headed by John I.

Loris. I told him inat tne Bridges organization was practically controlled

by Coumunists and that the Commnists haà now deciued to make very deiimite

plans to

get control of the Lewis organization.

I called his attention to the activities of the Newspaper Guild

headed by Heywood Brown, which has strong Coumunistic leanings, and which

has been responsible for putting out of operation the Seattlo Poat Intei-

ligencer. I told him that my inforaation ras that the Communists hau planned

to geù control of tesa three groups and by doing so they would be ablo at

any tine to paralyze the country in that they could stop all shipping in

and out through the Bridges organizution; sion the operation of industry

through the Mining Union of Lewis; and stop publication of any newspapers

of the country through the Newspaper Guila.

I also related to hin the activities which have recenily oc-

cured within Goverrmental sorvice inspired by Communists, particularly

in some of the Departnents and in the National Labor Relations Board.

I likewise informod him that I had received information to the

effect that the Communist Internationale in Moscow has recently issued in-

structions for all Communisis in the Uniied Statas to vote for President

Roosevelt for reelection and against Governor Landon because of to fact

that Governor Landon is opposed to class warfare.

The President siated that he had been considerably concerned

about the movements of the Communists and of Fascism in te United States

and that vaile the Secret Servica of ine Ireasury Departnant had assured

him that they had infornants in every Conmunisi group, he believed that

If thai was true it was solely for the surpose of geiting any irformiion

economic and political life oî the country as a role. I tola nia thst inere

is at the present time no governmental organization which

1 is getting any

so-called "genaral intelligence information" upon this subjeci.

He inquired

what suggestions I night offer relative to this mattes.

I cola hit that

the appropriation of tne Fedoral Bureau of Investigation contains a prori-

sion thai it night investigate any matters reierred to it by the departeni

of State and that if the State Departnent shoula ask for us to conduct such

an investigation ne could do so under our present authority in te appro-

priation already granied. He stated that he is reluctont to have a form?

request come through the State Departent because of the many leaks therein, !

but that what he would do rould be to put a handmitten memorandu. on his

own in his safe in the thite House, stating he had

instructed the Secratáo..

of state to reuest this information to be obtained by the Depertmost oi

Justice. He stated he rould have the Secretary of State at the thave doüse

tomorrow aîternoon, and asked me to call at the inive House at 1:45 g.".

to see him, the President, and the Secretary of State, at which time the

natter could be further discussed and an oral request could be made of me

by the Secretary of State for investigation so as to avoid any possibility

of axy leak.

He suggested that I endeavor to coordinate any investigation

along similar lines which night be made by the Military or Naval Intelligence

Services. He stated that the Secret Service was not being broughü in on this

investigation as they should contine themselves strictly to the matter of

protecting his life and tho survey nich he desired to have made was on a

much broader field.

VIOLENCE BY PUERTO RICAN

NATIONGLISTS

The following summary has been prepared in answer to

a request for information received fron the National security

Council on the lessons to be learned from the recent outorean

of violence by the Puerto Bican Nationalists insofar as internal

security measures are concerned.

The suntary has been designed to answer the following

specific questions:

..

Were internal security resporsibilities clearly

assigned, properly executed and adequately coorci-

nated, boin in and between the continental unitea

States ana Puerto Rico?

B.

What additional or indroved measures could be taken

either in the intelligence of operational fields to

prevent or be prepared for future situations of

this character?

SUMATION

• Although investigation is continuing, it would appear

-on the basis of cuailable cata trot recent events in Puerto

Rico

constituted more or less spontaneous acts of violence, apparently

touched off by a raid bu Insular folice on a ictionalist Porty

cache of arms and annunition.

This GisturDance was brought quickl!

under control. suer effective action reflects the efficiencú of

the close, established coring reintionships between the FBI ano

agencies hoving intelligence and opercting responsibilities in-

volving internal security matters in puerto rico.

Insular cuthorities vere prepared to meet the assaults

on the peace due to the previous warnings of Nationalist

to the pries

preparations for revolution.

Evidence to support the assumption that these assaults

- reflected spontaneous action and not carejul extensive planning is:

The absence of major acts of sabotage.

B. The foilure to attemot to capture centers and lines

of communication such as racio stations, telephones,

telegraphs, etc.

The acts of violence did not proceed according to

a pattern nor were they choracterized by even

elementary coordination and timing.

HISTORY OF THE MATIONALIST PARTY

The Nationolist Party of Puerto Rico clains that its

origin can be traced back to September 23, 1868,

when a small

revolution took place at Lares, Fuerto Rico, for the purpose

of overthroiving the spanish Government, preparatory to establish-

•ing a Republic of puerto Rico. This revolution was quickly

quelled by spanish authorities.

On November 25, 1897, Spain recognized the Republic

of puerto fion in a document referred to as the "autonomis

Charter."

Shortly therecfter, when spoin was defeated in a

war with the United States, Puerto Rico was ceded to this country

in accordance with the ciains of the treaty of Paris.

The

Nationalist Party refused to recognize this irecty, charging it

null and yoid where puerto rico is concerned.

Although there has long been an independence movement

in Puerto Rico, the lotionalist Party as it is known today dic

•not come into existence until 1922.

In this

year it was formaily

established at lio Piedras, Puerio Rico. Tie declared ourposes

of this party were ano still are: (1) to secure the separation

of puerto rico ¿rom the United states; ano (2) to create "a free,

ndepencent, and sovereian nation.

The declared means to this

end include the use of force and violence leading to open, wide-

spread armed rebellion.

The history of the Nationalist Party has been closely

identified with Pedro Albizu Campos, current president of the

Party.

He is a Puerts Rican by birth and a graduate of taruard

_University.

He serued in the United Stotes Army from Mau,

1917, to April, 1919, receiving ot that time an honorable

discharge. Following this discharge, Campos instituted a vicious

In the same year,

During the seriod from June, 1913 to Decenber 15,

1947, Campos was in New York City.

In the fall of 1947 in

anticipation of the return of Cairoos to fierto lico from New

group of young men in military drills.

These young men were

at the dock on December 15, 1947, dressed in the Cadet uniform

Of the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico's Army as an Honor Guard

to

receive their President, Pedro Albizu Campos.

During the period, 1948 to 1950, the Nationalist Party

took steps to develoo and enlarge its Codet Coros. During

1949, eight Nationalists were convicted and sentenced to the

penitentiary for a violation of the selective service Act of

- 1948.

At the Annual Assembly of the Nationalist

party of

Puerto Rico held on December 18,

in Puerto Rico, Campos

is reliably reported to have stated,

194ahe Cadet Corps must be

made the most powerful army in fuerto Pico, ready for action."

Other information received during 1950 revecled that

individuals connected with the Nationalist Party were engaging

firearms practice.

OBJECTIVES

The over-all objective of the Internal Security Program is to

protect the ünited States against the threats of Communism and other

subversive movements, particulorly arainst the designs of soviet

Russia and her satollites upon the security of the United States.

Sabotage, espionage and súbversion within the United States can cause

not only the loss of imerican lives and the loss of battles anywhere

in the world, but can cause serious disruption of our productive

capacity and adversely affect the maintenance of a stable economy•

Communist doctrine provides that a period of peace is to be

used to consolidate and strengthen the Communist forces in the world

while at the same time weakening and dividing the democratic nations

including disrustion of the internal life of these nations economically,

politically and socially. Thus the present Soviet "peace tactics"

• emphasize that our internal security protective corerage must be

maintained at a high level.

Soviet Russia can continue to increase

subversive, disruptive tactics without risk or cost to herself commen-

surate "ith the potential beneficial results to the Soviet cause.

The Internal Security Program was formulated on the assumption

of a continuance of peacetime "cold war" conditions. Hoever, it

includes the ejements to be expanded for a tartine operation.

The major specific goals of the Internal Security Program are:

1a To coordinate the activities of all agencies and departments

concerned with internal security matiers, including investigations, the

collection of domestic intelligence, and the integration of foreign

intelligence portinent to the domestic intelligence rield.

2a To continue the acceleration of investigations designed to

provide the basis for the apprehersion, prosecution, or other action,

against persons involved in subversive

activities.

3o To detect and muintain security indices on persons considered

dangerous to the national defense and public safety.

4a To neutralise Communist front and Cornunist-dominated organi-

zations in the United States.

Communist Party leaders are hopeful that, by exploiting such current

national and international issues as racial discrimination and peace, they can

bring about a resurgence of Party activity and influence. For example,

Benjamin Davis, chairman of the Party's New York District, in a report made

in September of this year to top communist functionaries, stressed that the Party

should concentrate on the integration issue as symbolized by the Little Rock school

situation.

Diligent efforts are made by the communists to infiltrate Negro groups,

particularly at the local level.

so as to agitate and create confusion.

The public usually associates the FEI's internal security

investigations with Communist Party activities orly. Nothing could be

further from the truth.

Our investigations encompass any and all

oxganizations based on a creed of force and violence to determine whether

they are a threat to our internal sccurity of whether they have violated

any Federal laws.

We investigate the activities of such diverse and international

organizations as the Marxist socialist Workers Party, and the Nationnlist

(sag. 150)

(31)

Party of Fuerto Rico. (Responsible for attack upon President Truman, 1950,

(32)

and Congress, 1954. ) Further, we investigate such fanatical and so-called

States Rights Party, an anti-Jewish and anti-Negro organization; and the

(rama 13. 155n) (36)

Confederate Underground." The latter is a name which has been mentioned on

a number of occasions in recent bombing threats and other forms of violence.

Since January 1: 195?, there have been over 90 bombings,

or attempted bombings, in the United States. Of these, at least 69 have

involved Negro victims and at least eight, Jewish religious and educational

facilities.

in the early bombings there was no evidence to show that these bombings

could be attributable to specific organizations. Rather, they were individual

acts of terror strictly within the jurisdiction of local authorities. When these

outrages occurred, we in the FBI have made immediately available to local

• ..

authorities our laboratory and fingerprint facilities here in Washington.

As the bombings directed toward religious and educational facilities

continued, the FBI extended its cooperation to cover out-of-state, lends which

local authorities could not handle. We extended such assistance to the

Jacksonville, Florida, and Birmingham, Alabama, Police Departments

in connection with the bombings of a Jewish center and a Negro high school

(37)

in Jacksonville on April 28, 1958, and the attempted bombing of a Jewish

temple in Birmingham on the same day.

Recently, however, there has been some indication of a gencral

interstate pattern to these bombings.

for example, one of the men indicted

(39)

on October 17, 1958, (Richard Bowling) for the bombing of the Jewish temple

in Atlanta, received from one of his fellow conspirators two checks worth

three days before the Atlanta temple bombing:

Recognizing the danger to the national welfare from a general

pattern of organized terrorism, the FBI has moved to expand its assistance

to local law enforcement in the recent bombings at Clinton, Atlanta, and

(11)

Peoria, Illinois. We are now providing all-out investigative assistance in

these cases.

We are closely checking the activities of individuals prominently

As a

further aid to local law enforcement agencies, the FBI has scheduled a series

of special conferences for November and December, 1958, to discuss our

cooperative services regarding bombings and threats of bombings against

religious and educational institutions

Our entry into these cases at this new level is not to be interprcted

as an attempt on our part to usurp the jurisdiction of local authorities. To give th

FBI this jurisdiction would relieve local governments of the basic responsibility

to maintain law and order, and the ultimate responsibility rightfully rests at the

Approximately 12.000 individuals are listed at this time.

This list is kept current on a daily basis by the acdition

of new individuals whose activities make them potentially

dangerous to the United States, and by the deletion of.

individuals who are no longer engaged in subversiva activities.

Included on the list of potentially dangerous individuals are

nearly 200 persons who are engaged in pro-castro Cuban

activities or who sympathize strongly with such activities.

In addition to members of the communist Party, it also incluces

certain members of such organizations as the Nationalist Party

and official personnel alone total 366.

It should be noted that the total number of such

personnel and their dependents has increased yearly since 1951.

t the mee Set in inclane diplomats,

and dependents in this country.

the figure of 1,605 represents

an increase of 250 since July i, 1960.

The FBI has continued its special program of intensified

coverage of soviei bloc officials in this country, and since 1951

nas identitled 593 Soviet bloc officials ag erther being or

nighly suspected or being engaged in inteiligence activities. 0f

the 654 officials stationed in the United States on June 30,

1901÷

a total of 138 were either know to be or highly suspecied of

being engaged in intelligence operations.

These 138 are comprised

0f 72

Soviet cificiais ana 66 satellite

officials.

This

large

number of individuals

engaged in such activity points up the

intense soviet bioc effort directed against the United states,

and represents over trenty-une per cent of all Soviet bloc

officials in the United States.

and unclassiiied.. Soriet bloc intelligence personnel

the effort of the Soviet blee intelligence

services is coordinated and guided by the Soviets. The satellite

intelligence services have been developed according to the

Soviet pattern, their key personnel have been seiected and trained

by the soviets, and the soviets have access to all data obtained

by the sateilites.

• C. Public Source Data

Soviet bloc intelligence agents have taken full

advantage of public sources of internation, both in Government

and industry.

Included in the article wore

available by various companies which were taking part in

the convention.

D. United Nations Secretariat

Pursuant to NSC 5427, Soviet citizens in the United States

have been restricted from entering certain areas of this country

in reciprocity for soviet action barring all loreigners from

certain areas of the Soviet Union.

in adaition, Soviet dipiomatio

personnel are

required to give advance notice oi proposed travel.

Soviet emplojees of the United Nations Secretariat,

however, have been exempted from these travel restrictions, and

the Russians have not hesitated io use their nationais, who are

employed by the U.N. Secretariai, in intelligence operations.

For example, in November: 1960, a Soviet U.N. Secratariai

employee

travaled to a New Jersey city to meet a U.S. citizen

whon he had been developing for intelligance purposes.

In July,

1960, anothes Soviet, also empicyed by the U.i. Sacretariat,

unexpectedly arrived

in lashingion, D. C., and

• contacted

a U.S. Government emicree.

The contact appeared to be an

attempt to develop the U.S.

employee as an intelligense source.

The above tro cases illustraie

the ease wiin which Soviet

employees of the U.. Secrotariat can travel.

No permission need

be requested by them and they do not have to indicate the area

they intend to visit. These facts make coverage of such personnel

more difficult.

E. Establishment of False Identification

In August, 1960, a Soviet official requested that an

FBI source obiain for him

a blank U.s. passport.

The official

requested, in the event this could not be obtained, that the

source loan him his passport and gave assurance that it would

be returned in usable condition.

The same official had

previously

requested blank diplomas from an ciementary school, a high school,

and a university. He also had requested birth certificates of

a male and female who were born in the United States between 1930

and 1935 and had since left the United. States and had not returned.

It is obvious inat the soviet was attempting to establish suitable

identification and background data to facilitate the entry and

operation oi Soviet illegal agents sent to the United States.

A Soviet Counselor at the United Nations took a

actalled tour of the Department ci dealth, lew lork Cy.

in October, 1950. de evidenced extreme interest in the handlin

of birth. death, and marriage certiticates by New York Cay

authorities. During the tour, he was interested in obtaining

samples of the forms

used for the ragistration of births, deaths,

and marriages. This is another case of an attempi to secure.

documents which can be used is establish identification for

individuals sent io the United States as iliegal agents.

F. Miscellaneons Overations

A Soviet Assistant Naval Attache has used a source

of the FBI to conduci numerous espionage assignmenis for the

soviets.

for example, during february: 1901, he instructec

the source to obtain books on the subject 01

oceanography and

Uos. geological survey maps. of fifteen U.s. cities.

the source

turned over the requesied maps after the maps had been cleared by

appropriate Government agencies for transmittal to the Soviets:

He was then instructed to obtain maps of tweive other U.S. cities.

Also in February, a Czechoslovakian Embassy official

instructed a source of the

FBI to ebiain telennone directories

of the Defense Depariment, the United States Iniormation Agency,

and the International Cooperation Aiministration, Io further its

efforts to penetrate the nited States Government, the Czech

official also suggested that the source seek employment with

the State Deparinent and USIA.

A Soviet Attache during March, 1961, requested that

another source of the IBi obtain a report of the Heuse

throughout the world to detect wire tapping and concealed

microphones.

Again in March, 1961, an employee of the Soviet

Embassy was in contact with another FBI source. He offered the

source five hundred dollars it the source would obtain two

have traveled extensively throughout the U.s.

In addition to making trips themselves, Soviet bloc

officials have requested

sources oi

On March 23, 1961, an official of the Soviet Babassy requested

that a source of the FBI make an espionage reconnaissance trip

to Her London, Connecticui: and obtain data concerning the

submarine base at new london. The source was instructed to

speak wiith sailors in taverns and to take a tour of the

submarine base.

H. Technical Data and Emuipnent

The Soviets have also utilized the Amtorg Trading

corporation, New York Ciir, to obtain Information and equipment.

In April: 1951. an official of the Amtorc

1 Tracing Corporation

requested that

an

FBI

source

purchase ten

1 thousand doliars

worth c electronic equipment.

The Amterg official specifically

saince

not to obtain an export license for such

equipinent but insicad to bring it directly to amtoro. It is

probable that the Sovieis contemplated shipping such

equipment

to Russia by diplomatic pouch, thereby circumventing United States

export laws.

As an example of Soviet interest in technical data

available in the United States, an official of the soviet

Embassy has contacied over one hundred U,S. corporations for.

information regarcing their products.

He has joined two

technical societies and has subscribed to fourteon technical

publications.

lle has shown particuiar interest in steel,

glass; plastics, electronics, and automobile manufacturers.

their propaganda in this country.

Soviet Embassy piaced an order with a dew York company for tha

aggressive, alert measures to counter this activity. The IIC

program of intensified coverage of Soviet bloc activities has been

established to meei

this threat to the United States.

III. CUBA

The close ties between the Castro Government of Cuba

and the Soviet bloc have required that Cuban activities in the

United States be given intensive coverage.

At the present time,

the FBI has approximately one thousand pending cases relating to

cuba, and has managed to develop more than Inree hundred separate

sources concarning Cuban matters.

farticular attention is being

devoted to the July 26 Movement and to the Fair Play tor

Cuba Committee.

The U.S. membership of the July 26 Movement consists

chiefly of Cuban alions

and naturalized U.S. citizens of Cuban

extraction. Its membersnip is estimated at approximately

thirteen nundred, Iccated principally in New York City ard

As a result of FBI investigation of this

organization, in july, 1960. It was required to rocistor with

the Attorney General

under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

The Fair Play for Cuba Committee is the principal

outlet for pro-casiro

propaganda and agitation on the part of

U.S. nationals sympathetic to the Castro regime. There are

indications that this organization is receiving

funds from the

Cuban Government. In addition.

investigation has shown that

this group has been heavily infiltrated by the Communist Party,

USA (Crusa) and the socialist loners Party (Sir), Doth of

which have been desinnated by the Attorney General

pursuant to

Executive Dider 10150.

In fact, some chapiers of the group

have been diractly arganized by and under the complete control

of the CUSA or the SiP.

In connection with the intensified coverage of

Cuban activities, it has been determined that Castro intelligence

agents have been

active in the United States, particularly in

Miami and New York. These agents have for the most

part

endeavored to gather data regarding anti-castro activities.

However, on occasion their operations have extended to plotting

the abduction of anti-castro leaders, staging incidents designed

to emiarrass the United States or disrupt U.S.-Cuban relations

•and planting agents in anti-castro organizations.

The close

relationsnap existing between soviet bioc countries and

Cuba greatly increases the possibility that these agents could

be utilized by the Soviet bloc against U.S. national defense

targets.

There are over one hundred thousand Cuban aliens in

the United States.

This large number of aliens offers an

opportunity for the castro regime to infiltrate agents into the

United States and also offers the Soviet Dioc a mechod of

gaining entry to the U.S. by Soviet illegal agents. The IIC

program is designed to counter this threat.

IV. COVERAGE OF CODINIST PARTY ACIIVITIS

A. General

A major part of the llc investigative program is

devoted to coverage of the Conmunist Party, USA (CFUSA) , and

related groups.

The CrUSA fanatically backs the policy of the

Soviet Union, and acts as a vehicle for Soviet propaganda and

...agitation in the

insted stateson The advantag

The advantage io the Soviet

Union can be readily seen by considering how valuable it would

be to the U.S. to have inside, the Soviet Union a pro-united States

organization which would vociferously support U.s. policy

through its speeches and its controlled press and

which wouid

be highly critical of any soviet policy mich conflicted with

U.s. policy.

The CrUSA is active in agitating and spreading

aissension in the U.s.,

and during the current racial disturbances

in the south, It has attempted to take full advantage of the

situation.

The Party has endeavored to bring pressure to bear

and student groups.

has suggested that the United Nations be brought into the

racial situation.

At the present time, the FBI has under investigation

two hundred known or suspecied communist froni and communist-

infiltrated

organizations.

nany of these organizations are

national in scope with chapters in various cities throughout

the United States.

These groups represent transmission belts

through which the

CFUSA can further its line.

B. Logal Action

One of the main purposes of the investigative program

concerning the Conmunist Party and its related groups is the

development of evidence upon which legal action can bo taken.

seven in New York, one in Chicagó, and che in Boston.

One

conviction under this section is on appeal to the Ninth Circuit

The decision as to final prosecutive action in the

case set for retrial. as well as any possible additional

prosecutions under the membership

section of the smith Act,

rests with the Depariment of Justice..

On May 31s 1961, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals,

Denver, Colofado, reversed the conviction of six former

functionaries. of

the CPUSA Who had been convicted for the

second time on charges of conspiring to teach and advocate

the violent overthrow of the U.S. Governnent.

The reversal

was solely on the casis of failure of the Government and the

triad quage to comply with the provisions of the rencks law:

which governs the production of statements of Government witnesses.

The Depariment has requested the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals

to clarify iis opinion as to whether this error may be corrected

by a hearing befora the United States District Court, Denver,

or whether a third trial is necessary.

N. BACKGROUND INFORMATION CONCERNING

THE EMERGENCY DETENTION PROVISIONS

OF THE INTERNAL SECURITY ACT OF 1950

AND THE EFFECT OF THEIR REPEAL

UPON FBI AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT

NATIONAL SECURITY INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 221

---

## Page 222

It will be recalled that Subchapter Il of the "Internal Security

Act of 1950" (64 stat. 987-1031) as amended, provided for the emergency

detention of "each person as to whom there is reasonable ground to believe

that such person probably will engage in, or probably will conspire with

other's to engage in, acts of espionage or of sabotage." From the time Sub-

chapter Il of the Internal Security Act of 1950 was enacted until the repeal

of this law by the Congress, the FBI operated under a Congressional mandate

which required the identification of all persons who might be covered by its

provisions in the event of a national emergency.

What is the effect of the repeal of Subchapter II of the Internal

Security Act of 1950 upon the jurisdictional basis for investigations conducted

by the Intelligence Division?

Essentially none. During the time Subchapter II was in effect,

lists of individuals to be considered for apprehension and detention under the

provisions of Subchapter II during a period of emergency were compiled based

upon information derived from investigations of subversive organizations and

individuals. However, investigations were not instituted for the sole purpose

of determining whether an individual should be considered for emergency

apprehension and detention under the provisions of Subchapter II. The

• '

identities of individuals who might be appropriate for apprehension and detention

in a national emergency were a by-product of the FBI's investigations in the

subversive fild based upon statutes, Executive Orders pertaining to national

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 222

---

## Page 223

security and instructions from the Director of Central Intelligence pursuant

to power vested in that office by the National Security Act of 1947. In summary,

passage of the detention provisions incorporated in Subchapter II of the

Internal Security Act of 1950 did not enlarge or restrict the FBI's jurisdiction

to collect information pertaining to national security. Our national security

jurisdiction has been delineated by Congressional statutes and Presidential

Directives independent of the detention provisions of Subchapter Il of the Internal

Security Act of 1950.

This provision of the law affected how information collected

pertaining to national security was to be administèred, retained, and retrieved

should exigent circumstances arise. Consequently, although repeal of the detention

provision of the Internal Security' Act of 1950 eliminated the Congressional mandate

requiring maintenance of lists of persons to be considered for apprehension and

detention during the period of emergency, it did not limit or enlarge the jurisdiction

and authority of the FBI to collect information in the national security field.,

In this connection, it is worthy to note that on November 30, 1939,

shortly after issuance of the Presidential Directive of September 6, 1939,

Director Hoover offered the following testimony before the House Appropriations

Committee in connection with the FBI Emergency Supplemental Appropriations

Bill of 1940:

"Purpose and Work of General Intelligence Division

In September of 1939 we found it necessary to organize a

General Intolligence Division in Washington. The establish-

ment of this division was made necessary by the President's

NW 54933 Docld:32989719 Page 223

---

## Page 224

proclamation directing that all complaints of violations of

the national defense statutes and proclamations be

reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This

division now has compiled extensive indices of

individuals, groups, and organizations engaged in

these subversive activities, in espionage activities, or

any activities that are possibly detrimental to the

internal security of the United States.

The indexes have been arranged not only

alphabetically but also geographically, so that at

any time, should we enter into the conflict abroad,

we would be able to go into any of these communities

and identify individuals or groups who might be a

source of grave danger to the security of this country.

Their backgrounds and activities are known to the

Bureau. These indexes will be extremely important

and valuable in grave emergency."

Thus, it may be seen that the compiling of lists of potentially

dangerous persons and individuals had been undertaken by the FBI prior to

enactment of the detention provisions of the Internal Security Act of 1950 as part of

the Burcau's implementation of the Presidential Dictive of September 6, 1939.

I pointed out that the situation within Caba would be, of course, even

more acute now than in the past and that Castro no dost had been materially

strengthened militarily as a rosalt coi the failure of the inresion.. I stated that

Castro's gorernraont wead continue to raceive military cauip cant from the iron

MEMORANDUM FOR THE DEECTOR, FEDERAT

BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Although the bulk of criminal offenses occursing

In the course of recent riots have been local rather

than federal in nature, the question as to whether

there was an organization vian (a) had made advanced

plans for, and (b) was active during any of the

riots

in the summer of

1967 is one that cannot airays be

readily resolved by locai authoritias.

In view of the

seriousness of the riot actirity across the coundry:

It is most important that you use the maximum available

resourdes, investigative and intelligence, to collect

and report all facus bearing upon the question as to

whether there has been or is a scheme or conspiracy by

any aroud of natever size, effectiveness or affiliation,

plan, promote of aggravate riot activity..

In this connection the following federal statutes.

could be applicable depending. of course, upon the lastlai

situation that develoys:

Title 18, USC, Section 2333, which proserites

the inciting or engaging in any reballion or

Insurrection against the authority of the

Unitad States.

Title 18, USC, Section 2334, which proscribes

conspiring to overthrow or

•to dastroy by force

the Government of the united States or to

oppose by force the authority thereor or by

force to prevent, hinder or delay the execution

.of any law of the United Stages.

I appreciate that the Bureau has constantly been•

alert to this proolen and is currently submitting

intelli-

gence reports to us about riots and about the activity of

certain groups and individuals before, during and arter

a riot.

Indesa, the president has said both publicly and

privately that the FBI is conducting extensive and comprehen

sive investigations of these matters.

There persists, however, a widespread beller that

there is more organized activity in the riots than we

presently know about.

: We must recognize, I bélieve, that

this is a relatively new area of investigation and intelli-

gence reporting for the FBI and the Department of Justice.

We have not heretofore had to deal with the possibility

of an organized pattern of violence, constituting a

violation of federal law, by a group of persons who make

the urban ghetto their base.of operation and whose

activities may not nave been regularly monitored by.

existing intelligence sources.

In these circumstances, we must be certain that

every attemot is being mede to get all information

bearing upon these problems; to take every step possiole

to determine whether the rioting is pre-planned or

organized: and, if so, to deternine the identity of

the people and interests involved; and to deter this

activity by prompt and vigorous legal action.

As a part of the broad investigation which must

necessarily be conducted, it is requested that

all

available information be reported and analyzed

i-Ing each sniger caught in any riot or extremist

activity and regarding those arrested during the course

of a riot or significant racial disturbances who were

not, residents or the general area:: Moreover, sources

or informants in black nationalist orgenizations, SNCC

and other less publicized groups should be developed

and expanded to deternine the size and purpose of these

to determine due whereabouts o gersons ho might be

Further, we need. to Investigate fully

allegations of conspiratorial activity thai come to our

attention from outside sources such as those reported

regarding Newark in Life Magazine for July 23, 1967,

and those regarding the Detroit riot which were furnished

to the Depariment by walter Sheridan of the Mational

The regular appropriation for this gear is $7, 300,000, und if the

supplemental estimate of $1.475,000 is granted the total appropriation

for this fiscal jear wiil be 28,775,000.

Before I take up the individual items, the phrasedlegy submitteel

for this item by the Bureau of the Budget reads as follow's:

Salaries and experies, defection and prosecution of crimes: for an erditional

amount for salaries and expenses, federal Burean of lucratuation, fiscal year

1940, including the sume objects and under the same conditions specitied under

confidential charscter (o L. S. C. 340: 53 Stat. 497, 895), 81,175,000.

You will notice that this phraseology contains three limitations.

First, for personal services at the seat of government an increase of

$100,000 15 allowed.

Our present appropriation allows un amount of $1.872.480 avilable

for personal services at the seat of government, and

this proposed

supplemental appropriation will increase that amount to $1.972.480.

The proposed ohmscolory in this supplemental estimate allows an

amount of $75,000 for the purchuse and exchange of motor-propelled

passenger carrig volcles. The oriumal appropnation for the hecal

veer bernis the nurchase of such vetudies un the amount of $50.000.

for 1940 of £20.000. making a total amount of $120,000 arnilable for

the confidential fund.

At tife present time there are 41 agents and 1.011 clerks assigned to

duties at the sent of government.

NUMBER AND SOURCE OF COMPLAINTS OF ESPIONAGE, SABOTAGE, ETC.,

RECEIVED BY FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

As a justification for this incrense I would like to point out that in

the fiscal year 1935 we recoired 250 complaints. involving mutters

pertaining to the national defense which includes siolations of the

espionage, sabotare, and rotted national defense statutes.

Mr. Hoover. From the entire .country. At the present time we

are receiving

214 coinpiaints necessitating investigntive attention

daily. If that average continues we will receive a total Of «pprox-

mately 78.000 complaints for the vear.

This comparison is indicative

of the incrense in tho volume of this work. If conditions become more

acute abroad, such complaints will increase materiaily.

Mr. LAMBERTSON. They are going over the heads of the local polico

officers?

Mr. Hoover. That is impossible to determine without first investi-

I do know that the complaints

Mr. LudLow. About what percentago are you able to dispose of as

being preposterous on their face?

Mr. Hoover. Not any of these 211 are of that character.

Because

of the source, many complaints, cun be disposed of without making

any extensive investigation.

Mr. LuDLow. What is your experience as to the percentage of the

complaints that have not any substance!

Mir. Hoover. A comparatively small percentage of them. For

instance we recently rerpired complaints of sabotage against certain

large liners.

Several siich

compinints hure been given to my in

reference to those shins.

They came from sources considered reliable.

Steps had to be taken promptly to make certain that proper protection

is accorded to them.

Mr. LuDLow. You cannot take anv chances?

Mrs Hoover. No; we cannot.

This is also true with reference to

the protection of our national defenses.

There has been an increase in such complaints from 250 in the

fiscal year 1938 to 1,051 in the fiscal year 1939, and for the present

year, the total number will be about 78,000.

PURPOSE AND TVORK OF GENERAL INTELLIGENCE DIVISION

In September of 1939 we found it necessary to organize a General

Intelligence Division in Washington.

The

establishment of this

division was made necessary by the President's prociamation directing

that all complaints of violations of the national deierise statutes and

proclamations be reported to the lederal Burom of Investivation.

This division now hus compiled extensive indices of individuris.

groups, and orgunizations enguged in these subversive artivities, in

espionage activities, or any activities

thit are possibiy detrimental

to the internal security of the United Stales.

The indexes have been arranged not only alphabetically but also

geographically, so that at any time, should we enter into the contlict

abroad, ve mould be able to go into any of these communities and

identify individuals or groups who micht be a sourer of grave rianter

to the security of this country.

Their backgrounds ard

actisities

are known to the Bureau.

These indexes will be extremely important

and valuable in crave emergenes.

As a result of the present dilliculty abroad the mail at the seat of

Government hus increased tremendously.

About 10.000 commini-

cations are being received each month irom perions and organizations

ofering their services or secking positions, as well as the many com-

plainte of violations of the nationul-defense statutes. This corre-

spondenee in the majority of instances must be answered.

It has been necessary to establish a translation scotion within the

General Intelligence Division whose junction it is to review various

foreign-langunge material recrived und secured by the Bureau.

A code section also hus

been established within the General

Intelligence Division for the purpose of decoding any inessages which

we are able to intercept or obtain.

Since September of this year it hus been necessary to maintain a

29-hour-i-diny shift at the seat of Government.

additional burden on our force, is that of plant protection.

ligence and Naval Intelligence

• turned over to the

Bureau of Investigation the handling of ail plant protection incusures,

in addition to the investigation of espionage and other activities.

Many factories in this country are manulacturing products for the

Anur and the dare under (invernment contract.

Mary Departments lure compiled a priority list of 1i30 plants which

they have requested the t

purpose of determining whether the proper plant protection incilities

are ariulable.

There are 12,000 additional plants that would come under the plant

protection piogram in the erent of war between this country und 8

foreign countiy.

Mr. Lidiot. Plants in the first group ore already producing, are

they not?

Mr. Hoover. Yes; they are already producing, both for the Army

and the Yasy. In many instances it has been found that adequato

plant-protection mensures have not been taken heretofore in these

plants.

To cite one instance, in one of the great airplane factories on the

west coust. a very impostant plant. plans for one of the Army bombers

were stolen.

We were successful in locating the man who stolo them

and in having the plans returnel.

The procedure under which those plans were given out each day

was indicative of the lack of a proper protection program in that fac-

tory. In the morning the draftsmen would secure plans from the loré-

man. No inqury was made as to their issuance and no recor was kept

of the plans given out.

There wore no chocks as to who had the plans

or where they were.

That is one step we have taken for plant pro-

We have taken steps to have that sort of thing corected.

Tnder nur plant-protection program we have included the securing

of proper fire-fighting equipment, as well as an eilicient and adequate

gunrd service.

It is not the intention of the Gorernment to police any of those

factories.

We have lnd our agents in the field divisions call in for conferenco,

the heads of the corporations listed on the priority list, and we havo

outlined to them the things they should do to insure protection for

CONFIDENTIAL FUND

In that iten. there is also a provision for a confidential fund of

$100,000, to he used for expenditures in connection with confidentini

inatters.

OINERAL INTELLIGNTE ACTIVITIES

I would like to mant out the volume of work in connection with

national-defense matters, or what we ell general intelligence activities.

During the fscal year 1.38 the Bureau receired a total of 250 mat-

ters in that 1 year.

In 1939 this had increased to 1,651 marter.

For

the current year te will probably have a total at the rate ut which.

we are now going, of 78.000 complaints under this classification. We

are receiving complaints at the present time at the rate of 2lt new

matters a day. as compared with 250 matters for the whole year 1938.

I frould also like to point out the congestion that has arisen as the

result of this increase in work, showing the reason why I am asking

for an additional appropriation.

The Bureau has pending on its dockets 21.916 investigative matters.

of which 7,118 are unassigner. making a total of 3t percent of the

matters unassigned.

RIATI'S OF SATIONAY. I:FENSE: C'14F"

I would also like to explain, in detail. the condition of the national-

afense work.

Of the total munber of matters pending. full are in

connection with natioual-defuse matters. Of that mumber 18t7 have

not been assigned, because of lack of manpower. Because of un-

aroilable manpower t1 percent of the national-defense cases ure un-

assigned at the present moment.

There are 1,5t9 delinquent national-

defense matters on our dockers tolar.

Now, as to the amount ot work performed by the agents, the average

agent in the Burean is carrying more than 19 cases. which is an exces-

sive number of cases for a man to handle.

As I told you ou Friday:

the field personnel are workine from 3 to ă hours a day overtune.

Of the entire personnel of the Bureau we hare 3u9 agents who hare

already been trained in the handling of this special kind of work.

making a total of to percent of the staff qualified for this work today.

At the present time there are

540 such plants aerively engaged in the manufacture of materials,

frauds against the (overment, antitrust investigations, and so jorth.

Mr. LuDlow. Did it cover lynching?

Mr. Hooven. No; there is no Federi statute on that.

You recall, a for ycars ago, Congress inesed a series of so-called crime

bills; such as the one corering unlariul ilight to escape

prosecution.

in answer to your question, the President in 1939 directed

that all investigations denique ith espionies, subotage, subversive

Bureau of Investigation, except those arising within the Army or the

tion dealing with national defense mutters.

Mr. Ludiow. How would a state of war affect your activities, Mr.

Hoover?

Mr. HooveR. They would by necessity have to be espanded.

Mr. LUDLOw.

Would it change your jurisdiction?

Mr. Hoover. Tint would depend upon what laws Congress might

Mr. HoovER.

Thit is correct.

Mr. Tamen. Is your set-up for the nntional-delense work separato

Mr. HoovEr. It is.

ATIONS, 1951

That movement, as you gentlemen know, has changed its name

many times, while its party line changes from day to day. There

is, however, one fact that prevails and that is that the party line

is based upon the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism.

I would like to present to the committee at this time a chart showing

the ramifications of the growth of the party in this country with

its various changes of names over a period of years.

Senator McCarray. I note that you use the term "Marxism" and

"Leninism." Leninism is a later version of Marrism, is it not?

Mr. HooveR. They use the term "MIarsism-Leninismn" as their so

called doctrine and philosophy.

That doctrine, as their own docu-

ments set forth, advocates the violent overthrow of capitalistic gov-

ernments.

They state that in their documents and in their speeches.

That doctrine further advocates the establishment, in place of the

capitalistic governments, of the dictatorship of the proletariat by

the Communists. It further states that that cannot be obtained

except by force and violence.

Une of the great instruments and teapons used today by all Com-

munists throughout the world is the resort to propaganda and

a the

resort to the boring and termite tactics.

That is an entirely

technique that came into being during the last World War, as I have

indicated, in the fiîth-column movement. That is the type of warfare

they are resorting to today to take over countries without a direct

attack. of arms, but rather by penetrating into governmental func-

tions, into schools, and into churches, where they will have access to

public expression and opinion.

I will deal with sone of those activities in detail as I go on.

COMMUNIST FRONT ORGANIZATIONS

Senator FerGusoN. If I may interrupt. Mr. Hoover, we have in the

displaced persons bill the use of the word "Communist" or "Commu-

nist Party." Is there any may you could lay down a standard by

which you could teil whether a man coming from a European country

was or was not a Communist within such a meaning?

Mr. Hoover. As regards that, senator, the only way you can deter-

mine whether an individual is or is not a Communist is through an

investigation of the background of the man and his associations and

contacts.

The Communist-front organizations are the parrots or

the "Charlie NIcCarthys" for the Communist Party. Those organi-

zations can be determined by just analyzing how they follow the

party line.

The particular man you refer to may not be a member of the Com-

munist Party of America and prohably would not be coming from

Europe. He may not even be a member of the Communist Party of

the country from which he is coming.

Since the trial in New York

of the 11 Communist lenders, memborship cards are no longer issued,

membership lists have been destroyed. and secret ways of communi-

cating with each other have been established, so that the only way

in which you could really tind out a man's connections is through an

investigation of him.

Sonator Percesos. What would you say a Marxist ras?

Mr. Hoover. There may be a small group, senator, of so-called

Marxists who would term themselves "philosophical Marxists" that.

is, as adhering to the philosophy of slars mit not going as far as

Lenin. I personally think that is a fallacious line of demarcation.

I think they are Marxists and out-and-out Communists in the sense

that you and I use the word.

Senator FerGuso,. That is my judgment-a Marxist is a Commu-

nist.

Mr. Hoover. I believe that very definitely.

Senator MIcCarrly. Is not that largely true of Leninism?

Mr. Hoover. Exactly. They are synonymous terms, Mr. Chairman.

They call the philosophy Marsism-Leninism. That is one word, a

hyphenated mora.

lo go turther into this matter, many Americans have been lulled

into a sense of complacency by the claim that there are comparatively.

fery members of the Communist Party of the United States of Amer-

world-wide inderground movement, inspired from-abroad, they can-

not be dismissed lightly.

According to our best intormation, there is a total of 54,174 members

of the Communist Party in the United States at the present time.

I have here and would like to submit to the committee a chart show-

ing the distribution of the membership in the Communist Pary by

districts and by States.

SECTIONS OF UNITED STATES WHERE CONIONIST PARTY IS STRONGEST

Mr. Hoover. Most of the members of the Communist Party in the

United States are in the concentrated sections of population of the

country. For example, new York State has 25,000 members: Cali-

fornia, 6.977: Illinois, 3.361; Pennsylvania, 2,876; Ohio, 2,834; Michi-

gan, 1,250; Nassachusetts: 1.022; Nevada, 23; Wyoming, 10; Tennes-

see 27; Alabama, 141; Few Hampshire 13; and so on.

Even though

there are only 51,17t members of the party, the fact remains that

the party leaders themselres boast that for every party member

there are 10 others tho follow the party line and who are ready, will- V

ing, and able to do the party's work. In other words, there is a poten-

tial fifth column of 5$0,000 people dedicaied to this philosophy.

Senator SALToNSIsI. I sa a report the other day that disturbed

me very much, and it seemed to me something was wrong somewhere.

There are a number of people free under small bonds and sometimes

without any bond who are deportable cases, that is, deportable aliens

who cannot be deported because they are refused behind the iron

curtain. Are they being turned loose or are you people keeping an

eye on them?

cannot be sent back to Russia or to one of the satellite countries from

which they came.

Senator McCArRaN. Do you think it is a part of the plan to deny

them visas?

Mr. Hoover. I'am not far from having my suspicions along thạt

line, Senator.

I think it would be a very practical part of this

technique to have them here.

Under the rulings of our courts, those people cannot be held in

custody indefinitely. They must either be deported or released on

bond.

When they are released on bond, it is our function to know

generally what they are doing.

That merely adds to those people

whose activities we should follow in this country. I think it is almost

a travesty upon our democratic processes that you can have people 1l

this country who have been found to advocate the violent overthrow o:

our form of government, yet you cannot deport them nor hold them at

Ellis Island

Senator SartoystalL. Why can you not hold them?

Mr. Hoover. They are released by orders'of the courts.

Senator SarToNsTaLL. I understand that.

Mr. Hoover. We do not hare any law by which we can hold them.

It would be necessary for Congress to pass a law along that line.

It is a highly organized, militant, and disciplined conspiratorial group

following the whims and dictates of international communism.

was proven in the New York case which recently concluded with the

conviction of 11 members pi the executive board of the Communist

Party.

The Communist Party of the United States constitutes a

fifth column if there ever was one.

EFFECT OF THE COMMUNIST LEADERS' TRIAL

The trial of the 11 members of the executive board of the Commu-

nist Party in New York last year took the Bureau approximately 10

ments were returned.

I have here a chart outlining the members who were indicted with

a brief statement about the case which I would like to submit to the

committee.

The trial of the Communist leaders removes any doubt in the

minds of right thinking people as to where the loyalty of the Com-

munist Party rests. It was brought out at the trial that the party is

& group dedicated to the overthrow of our Government.

The Communist trial in New York has also resulted in making the

work of the Bureau more dillicult, and I will cite the reasons why.

Before pointing out some of the problems that we have had to face,

let me siy that it was necessary in the trial to use seven informants

of the Bureau. They appeared and testified against the defendants.

We had more available if they were necessary, but the evidence was

so overwhelming that it was not necessary to introduce them.

All of the intormants who testifiod were bona fide members of the

party. They had been in the party for some years. Alr. Thilbrick,

who was one of the principal witnesses for the Coternment, had been

of the professional branch of the Communist Party, District No. 1,

in Massachusetts. Another informant who testified in that trial, the

night before had conterred with and had been in conterence

with

high ranking members of the Communist l'arty and the nest morning

testified against them as a representative of the fBI.

DECENTRALIZATION AND UNDERGROUND ACTIVITY OF COMMUNISTS

Now, that case, as I say, has raised certain problems because with

that penetration of their apparatus, the Communist leaders have

become increasingly security conscious and hare developed certain

security measures to protect their organization.

The trend has been toward the perfection of a highly developed

underground apparatus and decentralization of Communist Party

comminist Party cent, alie pior ose almos to pea the mi their

congregating in such large groups. As a security measure, no Com-

munist carty membership cards were issued in 1sz9. The mainte-

nance of membership records has been discontinued. Ilembers speak

in a jargon of double talli, and use codes in correspondence. A cour-

ier system has been substituted to protect confidential party communi-

cations. Public meetings are maintained at an absolute minimum.

Party records have been destroyed or removed to clandestine hiding

places. Secret printing facilities and supplies have been secreted for

future underground operations. Transiers of party members from

one district to another are now controlied through the use of an elab-

orate identification system.

The party today is in the process of selecting individuals for secrel

leadership of its underground apparatus. lo counteract the FBI,

penetration of the Communist Party, its leaders have established a far-

i reaching and vigorous loyaity program of its orn, calling for the

establishment of investigating committees in each State and a thorough

investigation of each member of the party as to personal history, activi-

ties, associations, contacts, and length of membership.

Each member

which consists of 13.

Now, I state these things because these steps tending toward security

within the party have made more difficult the Bureau's maintenance

of confidential informant coverage of the activities of the party. I

do not mean to infer to the committee that me do not have good sources

of information or that me do not have good representation in the

party in varying positions of trust. But it is true that it is more

difficult to penetrate the party today. Those in the party exercise

greater caution. Investigation of party leaders requires more ingenu-

ity.. The additional budget request will materially aid us in main-

taining the type of coverage necessary for the preservation of our

internal security.

Senator Ferocsoy. Where are they getting their money?

Mr. Hoover. Various benefits and fund-raising drives are held from

which money is obtained. Then they also receive contributions from

Senator FERGUSON. Are they spending a lot of money on their

pAr. Hoover. They spent a large amount of money in the New Fork

trial with regard to propaganda and legal counsel.

Senator FrrGusoN. How much would you say they spent?

Mr. Hoover. I cannot give you an otthand estimate on that.

Senator FERGUSON. Do they raise money here in Washington?

Mr. Hoover. They raise it all over the country and right here in this

city of Washington.

COMMUNIST FRONT ORGANIZATIONS

I would like now to take up the activities of certain of these front

organizations. A new drive is being launched in the Communist

Party circles to revive that is known as the united •front program

which characterized the party's greatest growth in the middle thirties.

One of the great dangers of communism is the ability of its espousers

to infltrate and corrupt various spheres of American life.

The way to evaluate the real etfectiveness of the Communist Party

is by observing its influence and its ability to infltrate otherwise

thoroughly American phases of life.

Combating the front organizations is more difficult today than ever

before. To prove party amliation is dificult: but their deeds and acts

expose them for what they are. They cannot long survive in the spot-

light of truth.

At the present time scores of known or suspected Communist Party

front organizations are under' investigation by the FBI. Many are

organizations national in scope with chapters in various cities through-

out the United States.

The Communist Party has. through its increased activities, en-

deavored to exploit youths, reterans, civil rights, foreign nationality,

¡the press, radio, television, the motion-picture industry, educational,

political, romen, and labor groups. That statement can be corrob-

grated by overwhelming tacts which we have in our possession.

Senator HrtI. Are you going to give us any illustrations of that?

Mr. HooveR. Yes, I am.

Now, in connection with the Communist front organizations, the

FBI is primarily concerned with Communist infiltration of such or-

ganizations and the manner in which Communists seek to subrert these

organizations to further the Communist cause.

Experience has demonstrated that many fronts are used as a cover

for espionage purposes and others as a propaganda media.

COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF BASIO INDUSTRIES

Now, I would like to refer briefly to the infiltration by the Com-

munists into our basic industries.

The Communists have long ad-

vocated working through trade-unions as a incans of accomplishing

their ends. Forty-eight percent of the membership of the Communist

Party is in the basic industry of this country. In this manner, they

would be able to sabotage essential industry in vital defense areas

in the event of a national emergency.

## Page 284

STATE, JUSTICE

OMMERCE, JUDICIARY APPROPR

IONS, 1851 147

Our investigations disclose that Communist activities are most pro-

nounced in such strategic industrial areas as New York, New Jersey,

Ohio, Pennsylvania, California, and Michigan.

Communist efforts toward infiltration have been intensified in basic

industries vital to our security such as steel, heavy machinery, min-

ing, communications, transportation, the electrical industry, and the

maritime industry.

COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA ACTIVITIES

The Communists have developed one of the greatest propaganda

machines that I think modern civilization has ever known.

They

capitalize upon ill-founded charges designed to enlist honest, progres-

sive liberals to support left-wing causes.

". Of the many proiessions, penetration of the legal profession is the

most amazing. As officers of the courts, well trained and educated,

lawyers have made some of the inest contributions to American lite.

It is regrettable, therefore, that any association of lawyers mill per-

mit itself to be used and parrot the Communist Party line.

Earl Browder, then the acting head of the Communist Party, on

September 6, 1939, while testifying before a congressional committee,

defined what he meant by the term "transmission belt."

• He said, "Transmission belts reter entirely to the Communist ap-

proach to the problems of reaching the masses. Transmission belts

mean haring

Communists work among the masses in the various

organizations."

He later was asked about & group of organizations as to whether

they were Communist transmission beits.

When asked about tha

National Lawyers Guild, he replied, "Yes; they are one of the oi-

ganizations."

During the trial of the 11 Communist leaders in New York, the

bar was shocked by the actions of the deiense attorneys. Some of

those lawyers were members of the National Lawyers Guild.

; Senator lIcCarray. Mr. Hoover, it is very evident that we cannot

INTERNAL SECURITE OPERATIONS

Mr. Hoover. The FBI's work in the internal security field continues

to mount and there is every reason to expect these matters will place

an increasingly heavier burden upon our investigative stafi. Constitut-

ing a major responsibility of the EBI, investigations of internal secu-

Ilty matters are conducted to develop evidence for legil proceedings

as trell as to enable Government officials responsible for the satety and

welfare of the citizenry to take appropriate corrective or preventive

action.

NEW LEFT TERRORISII

The New Left terrorism is best personified by the Weatherman

group, a group which split with the Students for a Democratic So-

ciety in 1969 so that it could build itself into a small, tough, paramili-

taly urganization to carry nut, guerrilla wartare in order to bring

about a revolution in this country. The Weatherman, addicted to vio-

lence and hostile to our society, has from its underground perch

claimed credit for the bombings at colleges. business establishments

and Government installations including the March 19T1 bombing of

the U.S: Capitol. Over 20 Weathermen are currently FBI fugitives

for violations of Federal statutes or local mob action laws.

The present-day Students for a Democratic Society is dominated by

the Worker Student Alliance which in turn is controlled by the com-

munist Progressive Labor Party. The Worker Student Alliance fac-

tion is critical of bombing and violence in the belief that such tactics

would impede rather than aid in the development of the revolution-

Lry movement at this time

The Venceremos Brigade. organized in 1969 by a coalition of Ner

Left groups, has proclaimed its purpose is to perform manual labor in

the citrus and sugar cane fields of Cuba as a contribution to Castro's

economy and revolution. Since December 1969, some 1,550 young

Americans, in defiance of the State Department travel ban, have

journeyed to Cuba as part of the Venceremos Brigade. Another con-

tingent. the fifth, is currently planned for llarch 1972.

While in Cuba, Brigade members were subjected to revolutionary

speeches and were provided with hard-core revolutionary literature.

Repeatedly they were told they are the vanguard of the revolution

in the United States.

Although some of these college - and high school-age Americans have

rejected the communist propaganda and rerolutionary philosophy di-

rected at them in Cuba, many of the returning Brigade members en-

thusiastically adopted the anti-United States stance promulgated in

Cuba and have aligned themselres with the violence-prone Weather-

man and other extremist groups.

New Left,terrorists present a profound challenge to lar enforce-

ment. To their threats. their violence and their total disregard for the

law, the FBI and all law enforcement offcers must respond in a lawful

and professional manner. Meeting the challenge will require continued

vigilance to protect the lives and property of the public and continued

dedication to the task of bringing these terrorists to justice.

ANTIWAR DEMONSTRATIONS

Three groups emerged during the Spring of 1971 as the main spon-

sors of the antiwar morement. One group, the National Peace Action

Coalition, is dominated br the communist Socialist Workers Party

along with its youth group, the Young Socialist Alliance. The Coali-

tion adrocates mass nonviolent protest. demonstrations on the sole

issue of ending the war.

The second group, the Peoples Coalition for Peace and Justice, is

supported by various antiar groups but more importantly it has the

unqualified support of the Communist Party-USA. This group advo-

cates massive demonstrations, including civil disobedience, to bring

about the end of the war. Into this issue, the. Peoples Coalition for

Peace and Justice injects poverty. racism. repression and women's

rights, among others, on the premise that the war in Vietnam had an

intensifying eflect on these problems.

The Vietnan

eterans Against the War, the

a group, was or-

ganized in New

York City in 1967 to stimulate veterans opposition to

the Vietnam conflict. The group rallied several hundred members to

participate in thespring 1971 antiwar demonstrations in Washington,

D.C. With a current claimed membership of orer 10.000, this group

of Vietnam veterans has engaged in numerous local actions, including

picketing and simulated battle scenes, to protest not only U.s. involve-

ment in

Vietnam but also conditions of racism and poverty in our

country.

STUDENT AGITATION

Disruptions on the Nation's college campuses during the 1970-1971

school year took a heavy toll in lost academic time, property damage,.

personal injury and death. Nearly 600 demonstrations occurred, in-

cluding 49 sit-ins and building seizures. The Reserve Officers Training

Corps was the target of In attacks. There were over 30 instances of

arson and there were 1s bombings. Over 150 personal injuries mere

sustained, approximately 10t by police and school authorities. Four in-

dividuals were killed during the disturbances and property damage was

estimated at approximately $to million.

The current school year. which began in the Fall of 1971, has seen a

general lessening of student activism. There. have been only o8 dem-

onstrations reported on college campuses, including eight sit-ins, tiro

bombings, and four arsons. Injuries to police and participants dropped

to five. Approsimately 5t arrests have been reported. Damages to col-

lege facilities amount to approximately 3322,000. In gencral, & dorite

lessening in the level of student participation in demonstrations is

being reported (February 23. 1272)

OMMUNIST PARTY-USA

Completely under Soviet influence, the Communist Party-USA

consistently follows the lead of the Soviet Union. Party leaders con-

stantly criticize policies of the United States while praising policies of

the Soviet Union as the Party seeks to broaden conflicts mrithin the.

United States in areas of racial, labor, welfare, and antivar activities.

A major effort of the Communist Party-US A, has been directed

into the campaign to support Ingela Daris, an admitted communist

Party member, indicted for the crimes of murder. kidnaping and con-

spiracy in Marin County, Calif., arising out of the abortive escape at-

tempt in August 1970, by Negro convicts on trial in a county court-

room. On February 23, 1972, Davis was released on bail pending trial.

The Party has mobilized broad support from diverse elements in the

United States and abroad through its propaganda that Davis is being

prosecuted because she is i black communist. Every possible ploy is

being utilized to divert attention from the criminal charges and to

imply Davis is being tried solely because of her political beliefs.

Ever mindful of the communist dictum that the revolution mist be

led by the working class. the Party in 1970 instituted a new front

group, the National Coordinating Committee for Trade Union Action

and Democracy. Through this front the Party is attempting to regain

lost influence in the labor movement.

The Communist Party-USA has long sought to become an effec-

tive force in the peace movement and is presently making a strong

NW 54933_Docld:32989719 Page 288

## Page 289

effort to dominate the Peoples Coalition for Peace and Justice. The

Party favors a quasi-reformist rhetoric and although it is willing to

work with the pacifist radicals and the revolutionary communists and

anarchists in the Peoples Coalition, the Party prefers an approach

which would de emphasize the disruptive and civil disobedience tactics

demanded by the more activist elements within the l'eoples Coalition.

This is in line with the Party's pose that it represents a reasonable

alternative to the disruptiveness of the radical left.

The Party is making a concerted effort to change its public image

and to gain acceptance as a legitimate political party. In the 1972

Presidential election the Communist Party-CS. aims to place its

general secretary, Gus fall, on the ballot for President and Jarvis

Tyner, a Party National Committee member for Vice President. In an-

other move intended to increase its stature. the Party again plans to

issue membership books and dues stamps. practices discontinued as

security measures in 1948. The most ambitious attempt to gain public

favor was the November 1971 filming for television of a portion of a

traditionally secret Vational Committee meeting.

Party leaders are still in demand as speakers and panelists at insti-

tutions of learning. it listing of appearances made during the 1970

1971 school year is as follors:

nelped the Worker

Student Alliance to develop its programs rimed at influencing stu-

dents to adopt revolutionary behavior through campus chapters

throughout the United States.

SOCIALIST WOrKERS PARTY

The communist Socialist Workers Party, a Trotskyist organization,

has been actively engaged in promoting and planning antivar demon-

strations through its front group, the National Peace Iction Coalition.

- Also participating in this antimar group is the Young Socialist All-

ance, the youth wing of the Socialist Workers Party. The Young

Socialist Alliance is extremely well organized and continues to appeal

o young radicals in the United States

It has virtually complete control over the broadly based Student

Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam which professes

to be the largest national student antiar group.

RACIAL EXTREMISAI

The coverage of the activities of black and white racial extremists

continues to place heavy demands upon the fBl.

THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY

Most prominent among the black extremist groups is the Black

Panther Party. The Black Panthers call for the orerthrow of our

Government which the Party claims is engaged in a massive con-

spiracy to repress all minorities, kill all Black Panthers and practice

genocide against the black race.

•(Discussion off the record.)

Early in 1971. a serious split dereloped between Huey P. Newton,

self-styled Supreme Commander of the Black Panther Party, and

Eldridge Clearer, then the Minister of Information and a fugitive cur-

rently in exile in Algeria. Warring factions loyal to each resulted.

Within 2 months. one member of each faction was murdered with each

faction accusing the other and threatening reprisals. The Cleaver fac-

tion is calling for constant violence and revolution now.

The larger Newton faction, in an effort to improve the Panthers'

image, is calling for "survival pending the revolution" which Yewton

explains means working and surviving in the black community until

the revolution occurs.

The Newton forces have 27 chapters operational throughout the

United States with some 450 hard-core members and the support of

thousands of sympathizers. The Cleaver followers number 250 plus

many sympathizers with the main strength centered in New York City

but with scattered points of support in other large cities.

The chief target of Black Panther violence and invectives has al-

ways been local law enforcement as epitomized by its perennial slogan

"Off the Pirs." Panther jarson for "kill the cops." The Panthers main-

tain that the police are an extension of the "power structure" of "im-

perialistic" United States and since the police are readily avarlable

every day. they have urged their followers to attack the police at every

opportunity. The eftectiveness of this campaign is evidenced by the

fact that since 1967 Panthers have been allegedly responsible for the

killing of 12 police officers and the wounding of 71 others (February 23,

1972).

The Newton-led faction has toned down its public demands for vio-

lence and attacks upon police and has shifted its propaganda to em-

phasize community service in an effort to repair its image. trograms.

such as free breakfasts for children, health clinics. free clothing Ior

the poor and free bus serrice for visitors to penal institutions are being

highlighted. Panther claims to extensive accomplishments in the serv-

ice to the community, however, are highly exaggerated. Much of the

food contributed by local merchants actually is used to feed the adult

members of the Black Panther Party. The health centers are staffed by

attendants untrained for medical work and of little serrice. First choice

of clothing is given to Black Panther Party members irith the remain-

der being handed out in the ghetto areas to the accompaniment of much

publicity.

Representatives of the Newton faction made 27 appearances at edu-

cational institutions during the calendar jear 1971 as follows:

In contrast to the efforts by the Newton group to project a non-

violent image, the Cleaver faction has adopted programs of unre-

strained violence against the existing order. Individuals associated

with the Cleaver group have been linked to murders, arsons, attacks

on police officers, aircraft hijackings, and armed robberies. The official

newspaper of the Cleaver faction is known as "Right On! " This publi-

cation has called for the assassinations of the President. the Attorney

General, the Director of the FBI and other Government officials. The

As his wife toured the United States, Eldridge Clearer was busy

creating tiro new revolutionary units. The Revolutionary Peoples

Communications Network was established as an international abore-

ground'liaison organization to publicize and coordinate the activities

of all revolutionary groups. Its underground counterpart is the afro-

American Liberation Army which will foster urban guerrilla var-

fare in the United States.

The organ of both new organizations is,

"Babylon," a biweekly publication which parallels "Right On!" in its

call for revolutionary violence and disruption. Clearer has assumed

personal command of the Afro-American Liberation Army from Al-

geria where he is in exile.

So that he may derote his full energies to guerrilla activities, Cleaver

has relinquished control over the Black Panther Party international

section in Algiers, naming Felix "Pete" O'Neal as his replacement.

•'Neal, also a fugitive from justice, once headed the Black l'anther

Party chapter in Kansas City, Mo.

STUDENT NATIONAL COORDINATING COMMITTEE

Another all-black retolntionary' organization is the Student Na-

tional Coordinating Committec which at the time of its founding as a

civil rights group in 1060. wns. known as the Student Nonviolent Co-

ordinating Committee. Leaders of the group have included well-

known black estremists Stokely Carmichael, who now lives in Guinea,

and H. Rap Brown. Wanted on local charges of noting to riot and

arson, as well as on a number of federal charges, brown was appre-

hended in New York City in October 1971 following the armed rob-

William Flunt, currently titular leader of the Student National Co-

ordinating Committee, is spearheading efforts to revitalize chapters

throughout the country. Included among these efforts are programs

aimed at establishing black revolutionary labor, student and youth

groups.

OTHER BLACK EXTREMIST GROUPS

Other black extremist groups, most operating locally and region-

ally, spread revolutionary rhetoric and promote violence and con-

One such organization is the Junta of Militant Organizations, also

known as TOND. with headquarters in Florida. JONIO, dedicated to

The Republic of New Africa is another militant black revolutionary

organization. Its principal factions are located in inchigan, lissis-

sippi, and Louisiana. In August 1971, at Jackson, aliss., Its members

engaged in a shootont with law enforcement officers who approached

the Republic of New Africa headquarters there seeking four fugitives,

of the founders, have been charged on a variety of counts including

conspiracy to commit murder and assaulting a Federal officer.

"BLACK ENTREMISTS IN PENAL INSTITUTIONS

It is becoming increasingly evident that black extremist activities in

our penal system are increasing at an alarming rate. Rebellion such as

occurred at the prison at Attica, V.X., has brought into sharp focus

major activities of black extremists, such as the Black Panther Party,

within the penal institutions.

The unrestricted flow of extremist propaganda, including its revo-

lutionary rhetoric, has stimulated the black, hardened criminal prison

inmates into an unholy alliance with the black revolutionary extrem-

ists. With the lessening of the Vietnam issue other extremist groups

such as the Students for a Democratic Society and Progressive Labor

Party are also interjecting themselves into the dangerous situation

that now exists in our penal institutions.

KLAN-TYPE ORGANIZATIONS

The FBI has continued to inrestigate Kan-type organizations which

had slight increase in membership from 4,300 a year ago to approx-

imately 4,500 at present. This increase in membership is attributed to

some extent to renewed interost in Klan-type organizations brought

about by rraction to school busing directires in order to achieve racial

balance in public schools. In addition to the membership, many thou-

sands of sympathizers lend their support to Klan programs and

activities.

tinue in existence. These groups such as the National Socialist White

People's Party (formerly the American Nizi Party). the National

States Rights Party and the National Renaissance Party, obtain public

attention in excess ot their numerical strength by caretully orchestrated

demonstrations and colorful public appearances in order to gain con-

verts and/or sympathizers to their causes.

URBAN UNREST

During the calendar year 1971. 109 incidents involving mob violence

were reported as compared to 159 for all of 1970. Resulting from

the 1971 incidents were 2.033 arrests. 213 personal injurics, three

deaths and property damage amounting to about $1.7 million.

Disorders in the Nation's secondary schools continue to provide

strong evidence that racial discord is far from being at an end. A

total of 360 disturbances, during which there were 72S personal in-

juries and 2,455 arrests, Were reported for the 1970-1971 school year.

During the 1971-1972 school year, 125 school disturbances involving

331 personal injuries and 750 arrests have been reported (February 27,

1972).

According to information received by the FBI through the Uniform

from 1961 through 1969 only three ambush-type killings of policemen

were reported

During 1971, extremists were known to be or suspected of being

involved in 76 unprovoked and apparently racially connected attacks

on police, resulting in the deaths of 12 officers and the wounding of

47 others! Guerrilla-type ambushes accounted for eight of these deaths.

Although the overall number of estremist-type attacks on police de-

clined in 1971, the increase in ambush-type attacks on police during

the past 2 years is indicative of the growing terrorist threat to law

enforcement.

URBAN GUERRILLA WARFARE

Urban guerrilla warfare by black extremist organizations such as

the Black Panther Party, by white radical groups. such as the Weath-

erman, and by other organized terrorists is a serious threat to law

enforcement and the entire Nation.

Increasing evidence of bombings, burnings and unprovoked attacks

on police led the FBI to convene 51 selected State and local law enforce-

ment officers from areas where this problem appears most serious to a

seminar on urban guerrilla warfare in Washington, D.C. in Vovember

1971. The seminar explored this problem of secret and planned activity

designed to disrupt and terrorize the Gorernment. Covered specifically

tere the robbery or expropriation" of funds. arms and explosives to

a further the revolutionary objectives of these fanatical few.

** The primary activity of the urban guerrilla is the unprovoked at-

tack on police officers which is designed to show that police are power-

less to protect themselves and, thus, to convince revolutionary sym-

pathizers that society can be overthrown. The urban guerrilla also

hopes to provide over-reaction by authorities in order to radicalze

sympathizers who would not otherwise engage in violent activity.

Carlos Marignella, deceased Brazilian revolutionary and author of

the "Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla," instructed that, "Every

urban guerrilla can only maintain his existence if he is disposed to

The Weatherman group claimed credit for the bombing of New

Lork City police headquarters in dune 1970 and Black L'anthers have

been identified in numerous attacks on police. The logic of the urban

guerrilla is simple, but terrifying: if police oncers cannot protect

themselves from ambushes, snipings and bombings, then the private

citizen is that much more defenseless against these weapons of the

revolutionary.

ANTIRIOT LAWS

The Federal antiriot laws, enacted in April 1968, established Fed-

eral jurisdiction for criminal prosecution in connection with certain

activities relating to civil disorders.

In May 19T1. Abbott Howard Hotiman tas indicted by a Federal

grand jury at Washington, D.C., on charges of violating Federal anti-

riot laws following an investigation by the FBI. The charges were

based on Hoffman's travel from Oklahoma to Washington, D.C., and

his activities during disruptions which occurred during antimar dem-

onstrations in Washington, D.C. in early ilay 1971.

Trial tas scheduled to begin in December 1911; however, the case

has been continued pending a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in a

related matter. Hotiman was previously convicted for violating Fed-

eral antiriot statutes based on disruptions in Chicago in August 1908.

He was also cited for contempt based on his courtroom conduct during

Following extensive investigation by the FBI. a Federal grand

jury at Miami, Fla, in December 1970 indicted three leaders of an

organization known as the Black Afro Militant Movement. Two of

the leaders were charged with teaching and demonstrating the use of

explosive devices and possession of a destructive device in violation of

•Federal antiriot and gun control statutes. The third leader was

charged with violation of federal conspiracy and gun control statutes

based on possession of a destructive device. One defendant, after en-

tering a plea of guilty, was sentenced to 1 year's probation. The other

two defendants were tried and convicted; one was sentenced to 4 years'

imprisonment and the other was sentenced to serve 2½ years.

Investigations authorized by the Department have involved substan-

tial commitments of manpower and resources, as typified by the fol-

lowing cases.

In March 1971 a violent explosion caused damages in excess of

$100,000 to the original Senate wing of the U.s. Capitol. This followed

an anonymous call to the etiect that the Capitol would be blown up

in 30 minutes as a protest against military operations in Laos. Exten-

sive investigation by the FBI is continuing and the matter is pending

before a Federal grand jury.

During the late evening of October I4, 1971, the Iranian Consulate

at San Francisco. Calif., mas extensively damaged by an explosion.

Damages to the Consulate and surrounding property were estimated

at approximately s1 million. Intensive investigation to identify all

persons responsible is continuing.

In duly 1970, a federal grand jury at Detroit, Mich., indicted I

members of the Weatherman faction of the Students for a Democratic

Society, charging them with conspiracy to violate Federal bombing

and gun control statutes. The indictment charged that the conspiracy

originated during a meeting of the leadership of the Students for a

Democratic society at thnt, alich., during Lecember 1969, and that

various overt acts. including bombings, attempted bombings and pur-

chases of explosives, followed that meeting. Five of the defendants

are presently free on bond, charges against one of the defendants were

dismissed in Hebruary 1971 at the request of the Government and the

other seven defendants are being sought as tugitives.

News media in several cities received handprinted letters in Jan-

uary 1972 warning that during July 1971 nine unusual prototype

bombs were planted in different banks across the country. The let-

ters stated that similar devices could be used to demand the release of

"political" prisoners." Explosive devices were located in safe deposit

boxes in banks in Chicago, San Francisco, and New York City. These

devices were bombs constructed of battery-porered calendar clocks,

photographic flash bulbs and black powder. The bombs were capable

of exploding.

The FBI conducted an intensive nationwide investigation based

upon which Ronald Kaufman, a 33-year-old Army absentee has been

charged with violating Federal bombing statutes. Kaufman is now

being sought as a fugitive.

REPORTS ON BOMBING INCIDENTS

For over a year the FBI has been collecting detailed information on

bombing incidents through its field offices. This data identifies the num-

ber of bombing incidents, types of devices, types of targets, and the

like. Beginning in January 1972, a program was instituted within the

FBI to disseminate this information on a monthly, quarterly and an-

nual basis to all law entorcement agencies through the Uniform Crime

Reporting program. This is another FBI service to keep local, State

and Federal law enforcement agencies fully informed.

ESPIONAGE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

• Although shifting political winds periodically cause an individual

communist nation to deviate somewhat to the left or right of its set

course, there has been no indication that any has abandoned its resolve

to undermine the security of the United States through espionage and

subversion.

THE: SOVIET BLOC

The Soviet espionage services continue to lead in the intensity of

these efforts and the other Soviet-bloc nations complement their

efforts in varying degrees.

As has been true over the years, these communist intelligence agen-

cles, which uniformly regard the United States as the main enemy

use as bases for intelligence activities their diplomatic and commercial

establishments in the United States. Soriet-bloc official personnel in

this country have been increasing in number over the years and as of

February 1, 1972, the count was 2,503. consisting of 1.166 officials and

1,427 dependents. Not included in the count are couriers. members of

special delegations and other officials temporarily in the United States

but not assigned to oincial establishments.

These charts which I ofier to the Chairman show the build-up of

Soviet-bloc personnel in the United States since 1967 and a current

breakdown of oficial personnel by country.

Mr. RooNer. TVe shall insert these charts at this point in the record.

APPENDIX A

PERIOD OF MARTIAL LAW

It is further agreed that when a state of martial law has

been declared by the President, the armed forces commander will

assume responsibilities.for coverage in these categories. His

authority to direct and

control the subscribing agencios of the

armed forces will be limited only by such instructions as he

may receive from the secretary of Defense.

He will have authority

to coordinate the intelligence activities of the subscribing

agencies

in his area of responsibility, within the Limits of

their available personnel and facilities, by, the assignment of

missions, the designation of objectives, and the exercise of

such coordinating control as he deems necessary.

He is not

authorized to control the administration or discipline of the

subscribing agencies in the area of his responsibilliy, nor to

issue instructions to them beyond those necessary for

• the purposes

stater ahaves.

II.

Personnel of the subscribing agencies in the area of responsi-

bility of the armed forces commander will still send reports to

and be under the continued supervision of their respective head-

quarters. They will render such aid and assistance to the armed

forces commander and his designated representatives as are

possible .and practicabie. They will furnish all pertinent informa-

tion, data, and other material that are or may be necessary or

desirable to the armed forces commander by the most expeditious

means and methods possible consistent with requisite security.

Each headquarters of the subscribing agencies will promptly be

advised by its agencies of all information and data appropriately

identified as having been furnished to the armed forces commander.

In time of war certain areas will come into prominence as

Interest in, though not control of, the civilian life within the

of the other agencies.

3. The armed forces commander is authorized to request and

receive such information from the other three agencies as he may

desire and they may be able to furnish.

II.

The analysis and exploration referred to above will show the

coverage furnished by each of the subscribing agencies and any

additional coverage each subscribing agency can undertake.

When

the commander feels that more complete coverage is required, It

is recognized that he is authorized to augment the coverage with

such elements of the subscribing agencies as are under his

jurisdiction. Prior to any invasion of the spheres normally

coming under the cognizance of the other subscribing agencies,

the armed forces commander should obtain the necessary authority

from the Secretary of Defense.

III. Irrespective of the fact that the preceding recommendations

have placed the initiative in the hands of the armed forces

commander, whenever any of the other services feel that such

a survey to determine adequacy of coverage should be undertaken

it should be so recommended.

It is believed that all four agencies should study,

Irom time to time, the coverage of the investigative field in

order to insure that all channels of interest and avenues of

information are adequately coyered by at least one of the partici-

pating agencies.

(d) Where there is doubt as to whether or not one of the

other agencies is interested in information collected, it should

be transmitted to the other agency.

(e) Consideration should be given to the fact that certain

classes of information are of general interest to the Military,

Naval, and Air Force Intelligence services in connection with

background and knowledge of espionage and sabotage organizations,

even though the Military, naval, and Air force Intelligence

services may have no apparent direct investigative interest.

(f) Should differences of opinion of a minor nature

MS KAI. GUIDELINES.

Incestigative ju

iction

Fil investigations

inder this

section are based

specific statutory:

jurisdiction and Depastmentil instructions.

Investigations conducted under this section alc to be directed to the

gathering of material pertinent to a determination whether or not the

subject has violated, or is ehgaged in activities which may result in

a violation of, one oi more of the statutes enumerated below; or in

fulfillnicnt of

Departmental instructions.

There

are three principal statutes which provide a basis for these

investigations, as follows:

Rebellion or insuirection (I1S, USC § 2393).

"Whoever incites, sets on 100t, assists

or engages in any rebellion

of insurrection against the authority of the United States or the

Laws thercoi, or gives aid or contort thereto, shalt be lined not

more than $10, 000 or imprisoned not more than

ten. years, or both;

and shall be incapable of holding any

'office under the United States."

D.

Seditious conspiracy (IlS, USC § 2384).

"If

two or more persons in any State. or Territory, or in any place

subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, conspire to over-

States, or to

Levy war against them, 'or to oppose by force

the authority

thercof,

or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the

execution of

any law

of the United States, or by force to seize, take,

or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority

thereof, they shall each be fined not more than $20,000 or imprisoned

not more than twenty vears

C.

Advocating the overthrow a? or ootn."

the Government (T18, USC $ 2385)•

"Whoever knowingly of willfully advocates, abets,.

the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or

destroying the government of the United States or the government of

any state, Territory, District or Possession thereor

government

of any political

subdivision therein, by fore ine

violence, or by the assassination of any officer of any such

government; or

"Whoever, with intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any

such government, prints, publishes, edits, assues, carculates, sells,

"If two or more persons conspire to commit any offense nimed in tas

section, cach shall be lined not more than $20,000

os imprisoned

not more than lenty jears, or both, and shall

be incligible for

employment by the United States of any departacut of agency thereor,

for the five years next following his conviction.

"As used in this section, the terms 'organizes' and 'organize', with

respect to any society, group, or assembly of persons, include

recruiting of new nembers, the

forming of new units,

and the legiony-

ing or expansion oi exasting clubs, classes,

and other units of

such society, group, or assenbly o1

persons."

The courts have interpreted this statute to require advocacy to

action, i.e., advocacy to do something, now or in the future, rather

than merely to believe in something.

In addition to the three principal statutes outlined above, there

are two other statutes which night provide a statutory foundation for

an investigation under this section.

These are:

do [Internal Security Act of 1950 (I' 50, USC, $ 783a)

In addition to the three principal statutes outlined in sub-

paragraphs a., D., and co,

provide a statutory basis

for investigation of certain cases

under this Section. This Act makes it unlawful to knowingly

Prosecutive determination

All discussions pertaining to the prosecutive potential of investigations

initiated under this section will be conducted by FBIHQ with Departnental

officials.

These cases should not be discussed with local U.S. Atromey's

office without FBIHQ approval.

Related statutes

There are a number of other statutes under the FBI's investigative

jurisdiction which should be borne in mind

in handiing these investigations.

Information concerning possibie violations

such statutes is frecuenily

developed during these investigations.

Where this occurs the field should

consider the desirability of conducting investigation in line with thie

policies and procedures governing the statute in question.

A list of other Federal statutes which may arise during these investigations

is outlined in an appendix to this manual.

Definitions

The term "subversiye activities" as used in this section denotes

activities which

term "subversive organization" or "subversive movement" denotes a group

or movement which 15 known to engage in or advocate subvcisive activities,.

as defined above.

s. Predication for

stigation

sed under the provisions of this

section, the first

conmunication propared for outside dissemination (report or LIM) should

show specifically the statute upon which the investigation is bascd

togethis with nocessary supporting lacts. Where investigation has bech

specifically requested. by Apartment, this should be indicated.

following examples are illustrative; however, the basis

for each

individual case must be tailored to the circumstances of

such case.

"This investigation is based on information that the subject's

activities could

involve violation of T 18, USC, § 2383 (Rebellion

or Insurrection);

, and § 2334 (Seditious Conspiracy).

A souice whose

reliability has not been determined has inforned

that the subject

as planning, along with others, to travel to Washington, D. C.,

1071, to participate in planned violent denonstrations

during the last weck in ilay, lord, to'shut down the Governent."

Demonstraiion plans include the blocking of streets

and highways,

destruction of pessonal and Government property, and pliysical

obstruction to prevent Government employees from

reporting to work."

"This investigation is based on information that the subject's

activities couid involve a violation of I 18, USC, § 2385 (Advocating

the overthrow of the Government). The subject is an admitted member

(or has bein identified as a member by a confidential source who

has provided

ieliable information in the past) of (name of group).

The (name of

group in its public statements and publications

advocates ihe desirability and necessity of overthrowing

the U.S.

Government by

force or violence, and the assassination of U. S.

Government officers.

The same source has reported that the subject

actively supporis these positions."

Where possinle, the first intra-Bureau communication prepared which

indicates thai investigation is beinglconducted]should specifically

indicate the statutory basis for the investigation. However, there

be occasions involving individuals or groups in contact with known

subversive clements where the purpose of the contact is not initially

known

and these

a preliminary inquiry must be made to determine

whether a statutory basis exists for full investigation.

In these

instances, a preliminaly inguiry may be undertaken, through estau-

lished sources, foi a period not to exceed 90 days, without specifically

indicating the specific statutory basis for the inquiry.

If after the

conclusion of 90 days it has not been possible to

establish a

statutory basis but further inquiry appears necessary, FBIHQ must

be furnished a succinct summary of the facts by letter together with

specific reconmendations as to further action.

course, investigations must be based on indications that subject

may be engaged in subversive activity, whether or not a specific

statutory basis is cited.

In the event preliminary inquiries fail to establish a sound basis

for investigation, the case should be promptly closed and there is

no need to

advise FBIIQ (unless FBIHQ has been previously advised

of the inquiry). Nor is there any need to prepare an LiN or report

Where no pertinent subversive derogatory information has been developed.

If the statutory basis for an investigation should change or be

expanded to include an adritional statute or statutes, the first

communication preparei subsequent to

such change or expansion should

specifically shoir such changes.

Similarly, this information should

be incluied in the next report or Lll prepared in the case.

E. ADMINISTRATIVE INDEX (ADEX)

1. Purpose and general policy

a.

To have a readily available and up-to-date listing of individuals

deemed currently dangerous to the national security.

Objective is to

identify individuals who should be affoided priority investigative

coverage in the event of a national emergency.

bo

Under no circumstance should individuals be included in ADEX merely

because of their opposition to Government policies or because of the

exercise of their constitutional rights of protest and dissent.

ADEX is strictly an administrative device.

It should not be treated

as a factor in determining basic investigative decisions, 1.e.

whether an investigation should be opened or closed, the extent of

investigation to be conducted in a particular case, etc.

2. Criteria

a.

ADEX should include individuals whose actions or statements have

established that they represent a curreht threat to the national

security, i.c.:

Individuals whether affiliated with organized groups or not) wic

have shown a willingness and capability of engaging in treason,

government officials, or othe:

such acts which would result in interference with or a threat lo

the

survival and effective operation of national, state or local

government.

GUIDELINES FOR EDI INVESTIG!

1. GUIDELINES FOR FBI INVES

LIGATIONS

Fundamental to all investigations by the FBI is the need to protoct the

constitutioial rights of any individual while still thoroughly and

expeditiously discharging those responsibilities with which it is charged

by statutes and Directives of the president and the Attorney General.

The FBI is a fact-finding agency which sooks with equal vigor to gathor

evidence which will aid in the successful prosecutior, or establish the

innocence, of allaged

violators

of laws of the United

States or of those

who are accused of seeking by force to subvert or overthrow the Government

of the United States.

The FBI makes no determination of the guilt or

innoconce of any individual or group so accused.

To this end, guidelines have been established to be followed in the

investigation of

cases falling within the

jurisdiction of the FBI,

prevent unwarranted investigations and invasions of the constitutional rights

of any person.

B. [SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS

In matters affecting the security of the United States, under no circumstance

is an investigation conducted of any individual on the

basis that such indi

vidual supports unpopular causes or opposes Government policies. All inves~

tigations of subversive or extremist activities are directed to the collection

of information pertinent to a determination as to whether or not the subjact

has violated, or is engaged in activities which may result in a violation of,

one of several specifically enumerated Federal statutes; or are in fulfill-

ment of instructions from the Department of Justice.

All communications re-

garaing these cases must be limited to intormation regarding the subject's.

subversive activities, sympathies and affiliations; pertinent background data

covering subversive individuals or groups with which the subject is connected;

and essential background data regarding the subject. No electronic surveil-

lance may be instituted without the specific authority of the Attorney General.

PrioI FBIHQ approval is required to institute an investigation of a faculty

member or an organization connected with an institution of learning or to

interview a student or faculty member other than established sources.

Inves-

tigations.uf foreign diplomatic or official personnel are not instituted with-

out

specific approval by FBIHQ and clearance from the Department of State•

No investigations are conducted of active or retired members of the U.S.

nilitary forces under terms of a delimitations agreement entered into between

the FBI and the counterintelligence services of the armed forces.

.C. CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE - ORGANIZED CRIME

Where matters

of a criminal intelligenco nature or organized crime are

concerned, investigations are conducted to develop and maintain current

information on

the activities of organized crime in general, and to develop

substantive cases against individual racket figure..

These investigations

are highly selective and are

•concentrated on the leaders of organized crime

and their reported associates.

Any electronic surveillance used in these

investigations requires approval of the Bureau, the Attorney General, and

authorization by a court order.

D. APPLICANT-TYPE MATTERS

In the area of applicant investigations, specific standards have been

established to protoct the rights of individuals.

All relevant information,

both favorable and unfavorable, obtained concerning an individual must be

duly reported; investigation is limited to checks of pertinent records and

interviews of

persons in a position to furnish rolevant information; persons

furnishing derogatory information are requested to furnish a signed statement.

Tho FBI makes no evaluation or recommendation to the requesting agency

concerning tho applicant.

PREFACE.

GUIDELINES FOR FBI INVESTIGATIONS

(E.

iF.

L

-

GENERAL CRIMINAL AND CIY

MATTERS

Our investigativo jurisdiction in crimiral cases is based

on specific

violations of Federal laws.

Investigations ars conducted whon information

is received indicating a violation of a Federal law, over which

given investigative jurisdiction, has occurrod. Results of our invostigations

are furnished

to United States Atiorneys or the Department of Justice for

determination

of the course of any prosecutive action.

The decision may be

to presont the case to a federal Grand Jury or,

if the facts so justify,

to arrest the subject, in which latter instance the

arrest is

made on

basis of authorizod prosecution and the issuance of a warrant.

Upon arrest,

the subject must be brought before the nearest United States Magistrate or

Federal Judge in accordance with established rulos of Federal criminal

procedure.

Requests for IBI investigations in selected civil matters in which the United

States is or may be a party in intorest are recoived from the United States

Attorneys and/or tho

Depariment of Justice.

These are handled in strict

conformity with guidelines furnished by the Department of Justice, as are

investigations of violations of the civil rights, antiriot, election laws,

and antitrust laws.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

In addition to these principles, numerous other

restrictions apply to all

phases of our work.

For example, our authority to arrest fugitives is

statutory.

The United States Code empowers Special Agents to make arrests

and carry firearms but IBI policy further requires that only that force may .

be usod which is necessary to effect arrest with due regard being observed

for the safety of the arresting officers and others.

Special Agents aro not pernitted to shoot anyone except in self-defense.

No surveillances are conducted in the White House, the Capitol, the Supreme

court, or the house and Senate Office Buildings.

No surveillance, electronic

or otherwise, may be instituted on any rember of Congress, any Justice or

Judge, or any principal functionary of the Execative Branch.

Our Special

Agents may not engage in entrapment or any other improper, illegal, or

unethical tactios in procuring information or evidence; any critical

complaints concerning FBI personnel must be thoroughly investigatod; any

testimony by a Special Agent in court must be given clearly and without bias

or embellishment.

I'he foregoing is a genaral statement of guidelines for fBI investigations.

all investigative personnel must follow these rules.

DEPARIMENTAL INSTRUCTIONS [(UNCLASSIFIED)]

According to Department, prohibitions in

section 793(a) b) are conditioned

upon suspect having

purpose of obtaining information respecting

national defense with intent or reason to believe that it is to be used to

injury of U.S. or advantage of any foreign nation; those in subdivision

(c) require

same purpose plus suspect's knowledge

or reason to believe that

it will be used contrary to espionage laws; subdivisions (a) and (e) relate

to suspects who already nave possession of

or access. to information relating

to national defense, either lawfully or unlawfully, which they have reason

to believe could be

used to injury of U. S. or to advantage of any foreign

nation, and no willfully transmit it to unauthorized persons or retain it

after demand made by person authorized to receive it a demand is

necessary under subdivision (a) where individual has lawful possession - no

demand is necessary under subdivision (e) where person has unauthorized

possession); subdivision (E) applies to suspects who have lawful possession

of national defense information and permit it to be lost or destroyed through

¿ross negligence or fail to report its loss to proper authorities.

Department has instructed all USAs that its prior authorization is necessary

• before instituting prosecutive action in espionage cases, except in emergency

where subiect is fueitive or damade may result from delay.

In cases involving photographing violations, Department has adrised

can be more expeditiously handled by presenting directly to USA for

preliminary opinion.

This does not alter

policy of presenting all espionage

to Department prior to actual prosecution.

Concerning section 798, Department has advised that classification may be

effected by written directive,

or by marking or stamping on item classified;

authorization may be established by written directive or oral testimony.

Decodes of unclassified information are covered by act where it can be proved

they facilitated analysis of cryptographic system.

Department holds that photographing or sketching of outside of commercial

establishment engaged in manufacture of classified military or naval arms

and munitions for U.S. Army, Navy, or Air Force would not constitute violation

of section 795 and/or 797, where no classified equipment or material appears

in photograph or sketch.

Department has suggested following procedures when obtaining and returning

photographs taken in violation of section 795:

Subject should be requested

to relinquish film.

Receipt should be

given to subject and signed statement

obtained to elfect film is being voluntarily relinquished. Film taken in

connection with section 795 should be submitted to FBI Laboratory for any

necessary processing and should then be submitted to commanding officer of

military post, or othar installation, for censorship. If film contains

photographs in violation of section 795, it should be delivered to USA either

directly by commarding officer or through Bureau.

Il prosecution deemed advisable, film should be retained as evidence and not

returned to subject unless, at

conclusion of case, USA feels that any innocuous

negatives or prints may be

returned. In such event film should be returned

As to rights of Bureau Agents in carrying out enforcement procedures regarding

violations

of

sections 795 and 796 by Soviot-bloc diplomatic and official

personnel, Department advised in summary as follows:

In all instances in which photographs or sketches of defense installations are

made by Soviet-bloc nationals, every reasonable effort should

recover and confiscate these items in interest of national security.

Soviet-bloc nationals who have no diplomatic immunity arc observed by Bureau

Agents to photograph or sketch

military installations in

violation of

sections 795 and 796, they may be arrested without warrant and film seized

as evidence.

If observation is by person other than Bureau Agent, an arrest

should be procured (because misdemeanor rather than a felony is

involved) and search warrant obtained if premises are involved.

Where Soviet-bloc or other foreign officials who may have diplomatic immunity

are observed taking photographs by Bureau Agents, they may be detained until

Bureau is satisfied they do in fact have immunity and film may be confiscated

in interest of national security. If Agents do not actually observe the

activity but received information from outside source, film may not be legally

since warrant of arrest or search may not be lawfully executed against

person or premises naving diplomatic immunity.

By Presidential

directive FBI has counterintalligence responsibilities

which it shares with military intelligence agencies and is also

charged with correlating information relating to espionage and

making appropriate dissemination.

Coordination in domestic intelligence

is effected through Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference.

By National Security ouncil directive, FBI and other U.S. intelligence

agencies coordinate foreign and domestic intelligence through U. S

Intelligence Board. (See section 102A, volume IV, of this manual.)

Io aid in interpretation of Bureau's policies, following terms are

defined:

(1)

Intelligence - obtaining and distributing information required

formulation and execution of Government policy

(2)

Espionage - intelligence activity directed ipward acquisition

of information through clandestine operations

(3) Counterintelligence

- intelligence activity which is devoted to

destroying effectiveness of inimical foreign intelligence

activities and which is undertaken to proteci

security

of nation,

• and its personnel, information, and installations,

espionage,

STEP TAKEN BY COMMUNIST PARTY, USA, TO AVOID PROSECUTION UNDER THIS ACT

The Communist Party, USA, held a special convention in New York City on

November 16 to 17, 1940.

This convention declared "that the Communist Party

of the USA in convention assembled, does hereby cancel and dissolve its organi-

zational affiliation with the Communist International, as well as any and all

other bodies of any kind outside the boundaries of the United States of America

for the specific purpose of removing itself from the terms.of the so-called

Voorbis 'Act."

IC. DEPARTMENTAL POLICY

(In 1942,

Department considered holding grand jury hearings under this

act at which leading Communist Party Lunctionaries would be subpoenaed.

The Japanese attack on Pearl

stopped any action in this regard.

When prosecutive action

was initiated against the Communist Party and its

top functionaries begirning in 1948, the Department selected the Smitb

and the Internal Security Act of 1950

rather than the Voorhis Act.]

VENUE

District of Columbia;

however,

aiders and abettors may be prosecuted in the

district in which

their criminal acts are performed,

and conspiracy charges

may be prosecuted in the district in which the conspiracy originates, or in

AND CIVI

A. INVESTIGATIONS OF ENTRIMOST CRGINTZNTIONS AND INDIVIDI

For the purose of this section, calcemast organizationg

and individuals

Indian exticnists

General Gidelines

investigative murisdiction

FBI investigations under this section are based on specific statutory

jurisdiction and Departmental instructions.

Investigation: conducted under this section arc to be directed to the

gathering of malcrial pertinent to a determination whether or not the

subject has violaied, or is engaged in activities which nay result

in a violation of oné or more of the statutes enumcrated bolow or in

fulfillment of Departmental instructions.

There are three principal

statutes which provide a basis for these

investigations, as

Rebellion

01: insurrection (118, USC, §2383)

"moevei incites,

sets on foot,

or engases in any

rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United

States os the lals therco, or gives aid of confort thereto,

shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more

ten years, or both; and

shall be incapable of holding

any office under the United States,"

Seditrous conspiracy (T18

"If two on more persons in any

place subject to the jurisdiction of the United

i usE state or Territoriledes, conspire

to ovcrthion, put down, oi to destroy by force the Government

of the united states, or to levy war agazusi mem, un iu vyyuse

or by foice to prevent, hinder,

o1 delay the execution of any law of the United

force to seize, take, of possess any property of the United states

contrary to

the authority

thereof,

they shall each be fined not

than $20,000 oi imprisoned not more than twenty years,

or both."

Advocating the overthrow of the Government (T18, USC,

32585).

"Whoever knowingly o1

willfully advocates, abets, advises

or violence; os becomes or is a member of, or affiliates with, any

such society, group, or assembly of persons, knowing the

purposes thercof

ineligible for employment by the United States

or any depart-

ment of agency theico, for the fiva years next following

his conviction.

"As used in this section, the terms 'organizes! and 'organize',

with respect to any

society, gioup, or assendly of persons,

include the iccruiting of new members, the forming of new

and the regrouping or expansion of existing clubs, classes,

and other units of such society, group, of assembly of pérsons."

The courts have interpreted this statute to require advocacy io

action, 1.e., advocacy to do something, now or in the future,

than merely to believe in something.

In addition to the three principal statutes outlined above, the tollow-

ing statute would pertain io investigations of. Klan and other white

hate groups.

(4)

Civil Rights Act of 1963 (ILS, USC, §211)

In summary, this statute makes it unlawful for two or more

United States.

Additionally, it prohibits two or more persons

of any rights secured by the Constitution or the laws of the

United States.

D. Prosecutive Determination

All discussions pertaining to the prosecutive potential of investi-

gations initiated under this section vili be conducted by FBIHQ with

Departmental officials.

These cases should not be discussed with

local U. S. Attorney's office without FBIHQ approval.

c.

Related

Statutes

There are a number of other statutes under the FBI's investigative

jurisdiction which should be borne in mind in handling these

investi

gations.

Information concerning possible violations

of such statutes

is frequently developed during these investigations.

Where this

occurs, the tield should consider the desirability of conducting

investigation in line with the policies and proceduics governing

statute in question.

A list of other Federal statutes which may arise during these investi

gations is outlined in Subsection 9 of this section.

FBI Responsibility

The FBI has been charged by various Presidents with the responsi

bility to coordinate and

collect all information relating to the

internal security oi the United States, including information tron

a11 other Federal and local agencies.

See Section 102, Volune 1'

of this manual.

This coordination and collection responsibility is

not to be confused with our

pEr.

The recent decision of the Suprene Court entitled Irvine v.

Califonia, 317 U.S. 123, denouncing the use of microphone survaillances

bu city police in a gamblinz caso makes appropriate a reappraisal of

the use which may be made in the future by the Federal Bureau oi

Investigation oi microphone surveillance in connection with matters

relaiing to the intamal security of the country.

It is clear that in some instances the use of microphone

murraalenes do the only pacciate way of uncoverina the activities

a capicacos agerts

, mossins sabotares; and subversive persons. In

such insuances I an of the opinion that the national interest requires

that sacrophone sumeillance be utilizad by the federal Bureau of

Investigation.

This use need not be limited to the development of

cridence for prosscution. The ESI has an intelligence function in

connection with intemal security matters equally as important as

the drug of developing eviácace for presentation to the courts and

the national security requires that the EST be able to use microphone

surveillance for the proper discharge of both of such functions.

The Department a Justice approvos the use of microshone surveillance

by the fBi under these circumstances and for these purposes.

I do not consider that the decision of the Supreme Court

in Imine v. Califonia, supra, requires a afferent course. That

case is readily distinguishable on its facts. The language of the

Court, however, indicates certain uses of microphones which it would

be well to avoid, if possible, even in internal security investigu-

trions.

It is quite clear that in the Irvine case the Justicos ci the

Supreme Court were outraged by what they regarded as the indecency of

installing a nicrophone in a bedroom. They denounced the utilization

of such rethods of investigation in a gambling case as shocking The

Court's action is a clear indication of the need for discretion and

intelligent restraint in the use of ricrophones by the FEI in all

cases, including internal

security matters. Obviously, the installa-

tion aí a microphone in a boiroom or ir. some comparably intimate

Location should be avoided wherever possible. It may appear, hoever,

that important intelligence or evidence relating to rotteal connected

with the national securiiy can only be obtained by the installation oi

a microphone in such a location.

It is my opinion that under such

that not Infrequently the question of trespass arises in connection

with the installation of a microphone.

The question of whether a

trespass is actually involved and the second question of the effect

of such a trespass upon the achissibility in court of the evidence trus

obteined, must necessarily be resolved according to the circumstances

of each case.

The Departrent in resolving the problens which may arise

circunstances in each case in the light of the práctical necessitics

of Investigation and oî the national interest which must be protccted.

which will permit microphone covcrage by the fbI in a mariner most
