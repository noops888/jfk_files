interview with Walker by a representative of that paper and the

second related to statement that Oswald made an attempt on General

Walker's life early in the Summer of 1963, and following

arrest

he was released by order of Attorney General Robert Kennedy.

•The above publication has been identified as an extreme right-wing

publication by the BfVi's)The Bureau learned from Marina Oswald

Bureau desires to determinesthe basis for the allegations in the

German newspaper. *The BIV believes that Muench was probably the

author of the 2 articles above and was in the U.S. some time before

issue 11-29-63 wherein the 2 articles appear *Dallas being

instructed to check whereabouts of Kunert/who was supposed to have,

Tuner to ted earn student at tea teen versity o

Dallas and a contributor to DNZSZa@Dallas not to interview Kunert

U.s., consideration will then be given to interviewing him. Bufiles

contain no identifiable derogatory info re Muench.
