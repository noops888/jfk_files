VI. Finances

On April 12, 1962, MM T-1 advised that the

activities of the AM are carried out through the

financial support of the Cuban Revolutionary Council.

He said that FRANCISCO CARRILLO, the nephew of JUSTO

CARRILLO, receives three hundred fifty dollars monthly

personally, for expenses, from the Cuban Revolutionary

Council, inasmuch as he is a representative to that

group.

FRANCISCO CARRILLO has been turning this money

over to the AM, in order that it might carry out its

various activities. MM I-l said the AM receives from

fifteen hundred to twenty-five hundred dollars monthly

from the Cuban Revolutionary Council, in order to

carry out certain underground activities in Cuba.

He

indicated that the AM has received monthly financial

support from the Cuban Revolutionary Council since

about September, 1961. 2(U)

According to MM T-1, the AM maintains an

account at the Coral Gables First National Bank, in

the names of FRANCISCO CARRILLO and Dr. G. CASTRO, the

latter individual being identified by MM T-1 as_ GAUDENCIO

XCASTRO SOLOZABAL, Financial Secretary of the AM.

checking account of the AM is maintained under No. 41-784-

640-4.

MM T-l advised that the expenses of the organiza-

tion are itemized on a monthly basis, and submitted

to

the Cuban Revolutionary Council for approval.(o(u)

According to source, this set now installed '

in IRIGOYEN's home, will be used to transmit messages

to Cuba and to communicate with a boat, possibly the

"Barcarolle," owned by the Montecristo Group and

docked at 8th Avenue N.W. near the bridge. 810S)(u)

On October 9, 1961, MM T-4, who is personally

acquainted with CELSO LUIS PIMIENTA, advised he had

learned that the latter individual had said an anti-

CASTRO group called the 30th of November had purchased

soth of at

an HT-4 radio transmitter and a BC-348 receiver from

Aircraft Radio Marine Company, located at Northwest

up for clandestine operation in the home of a woman

Avenue, Miami,-Florida.

PIMIENTA said a woman was

going to operate the equipment; however, it was sub-

sequently learned that the woman was not qualified

to operate the equipment, and the idea was dropped.

PIMIENTA related that the 30th of November

group thereafter contacted PIMIENTA and asked him if

he would operate the equipment from the above described

residence. PIMIENTA said he told the group he did not

PIMIENTA said he thereafter took his trans-

mitter to the above described residence, but he never

made a contact with anyone in Cuba, or any other

country for that matter, and indicated he subsequently

took his radio equipment out of that residence.

PIMIENTA said he believed the 30th of November

group was bluffing, and contrary to their statements,
