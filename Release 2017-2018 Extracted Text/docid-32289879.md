Re Chicago letter, 3-12-62, and BuForm 0-7, 3-16-62.

With regard to the requested interview of HELMUT MAIER and

ELROSE FUEGER in Munich, Germany, the Bundeskriminalamt (BKA - West

German Federal Criminal Police) advised that the Munich, Germany, police

had contacted MAIER, whose full name is HELMUT FRIEDRICH LEO WAIIR, On

4-13-62 and attempted to elicit information from him with regard to the

subject and in line with the suggestions in referenced letter. * MAIER

said that he was then employed by the export firm of Messrs. Linde and

that his employers intended to send him to the United States in the

future to represent them there.

As a result he declined to furnish any

information in this matter on the basis that he desired to protect himself

from possible future retaliations against him. He said that he would

only furnish positive information if he was given a guarantee that

nothing of what he said would ever become known to those regarding iom

he might be willing to report, adding that he felt that this condition

could not be guaranteed if Chicago police authorities became aware of any

information he might provide. MAIER wanted the Munich police to advise

what police authority was interested in the investigation and to be

informed in detail of what security measures would be offered him in

the United States.

The BKA informed that MAIER, who was born 5-18-29 in Munich,

Germany, was residing at 200 Saebenerstrasse, c/o Haeussler Munich 9,

Germany.

Records showed that he was divorced on 5-25-62 From DIETGARD

ROSEMARIE MATER, nee FUEGER, born 12-3-38 at Seewalchen, Austria

and

bank employee then residing with her mother, ELROSE FUEGER,

at 12 Rosenstrasse,

Munich, Germany, but with the United States address of 1216 Astor Street,

Chicago 10, Illinois.

The BKA informed that the Munich Police felt that a contact

with ELROSE FUEGER, described as born 3-22-08-at Heeden,, was inadviseable

64k

inasmuch as lit appeared certain that she would inform the subject regarding

a such lan inquiry.

With regard to MAIER's reservations and desire for assurances

for protection, the BKA was informed on 6-1-62 that MAIER could be informed

that the information desired was for the use of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation in the United States and, if he so desired, his identity

would be entirely protected and the information furnished by him would be

held in confidence by the Bureau; however, neither the police nor the Bureau

were able to promise him specific security protection in the event he returned

to the United States.

The BKA was asked to have the Munich Police recontact

MAIER and so advise him and attempt to obtain from him any information

possible with regard to the activities of the subject..

To date, the BKA has not furnished the results of this additional

requested inquiry which, however, will be provided as soon as

possible.
