leading members or the new Directorio Revolucionario (DR).

The source also set out names of individuals in the Miami

area believed to be active in the "gun running and

other

crooked deals."

With regard to the above, on 9/9/59, and 12/11/59,

RICHARD BOWMAN JAFFE, PSI, under development, Miami, (protect)

who is close associate of

On 9/17/59, MASFERRER, while being interviewed on

in Miami who is known to Customs and who is not involved

In any illegal activities, according to SHANLEY.

SHANLEY stated confidentially that KEITH HEATON

is furnishing information to U. S. Customs on matters of

interest to that agency.

LEM POMEROY is personally known to SA CHARLES W.

EDMISTON of the Miami Office, and is not known to be engaged

in any illegal activities.

The Miami Office has pending cases on ROLANDO

ARCADIO MASFERRER ROJAS (Miami file 2-156) and PRUDENCIO

DUENAS ROBERT (Miami

file 105-2027) IS-CUBA,

and their

activities are being reported under those titles.

0 9/29/59, FRANK PEREZ PEREZ (protect), 1044 NW

2nd Street, Miami, who has furnished some reliable information

in the past and who is in contact with MASFERRER, stated that

he knows of no reactivation of the DR, MASFERRER is not

connected with the DR and MASFERRER is not referred to as

General,

AL)

12/3/59, MM 639-S advised that he has no infor-

mation which

would indicate that the DR has become reactivated

in Miami.

(c)

The Miami Office has received no information which

would indicate that the DR has become active in the Miami.

area at any time since the fall of BATISTA on 1/1/59.

It is pointed out that on occasion individuals who

mention the Dominican Republic refer to it as the "DR." It

is possible that one set of initials could be confused with

the other giving rise for example to mistaken impression

that the Directorio Revolucionario was behind the attempted

exportation of arns in May, 1959,

in which individuals

connected with the Dominican Republic were arrested in Miami

attempting to fly arms out of the U.S. illegally.

the Miami Office, advised that he was in contact with the

Security Officers in the BWI and although not positive,

felt that the source of the information concerning the DR

was probably CARL STEWART, a Hungarian born Canadian citizen

who had reportedly done undercover work: for MAURICE HILL,

Nassau, Security and Police officer, and had also done some

work for U, S. Customs in 1958 in the Miami

area. CRASWELLER

said that he had no information re the DRIeS)

On 9/17/59, CARL STEWART appeared voluntarily at

the Miami Office and advised that he had furnished information

1958 & Customs, Mishi, coocerniag activittes of che a in

and that he,

STEWART, had been given a membership card

in the DR by LUIS

BLANCA (OR delegate abroad 1958), STEWART

stated that he helped Customs with understanding on his part

at least that his relatives in Israel would be assisted to

enter this country: After working awhile he found that he

had been mistaken in his assumption, He

stated that he was

unable

to get along with Customs and went to Nassau area where

he worked for MAURICE HILL (above mentioned) who is arranging

for help for STEWART's relatives to enter Nassau area. STEWART

stated that he had furnished considerable information to HILL

about activities which were probably going on in Miami area.

However, when he was specifically questioned for details,

nanes, places, etc,, as to what was "going on" he was unable

to produce.

In this respect it should be noted that SHANLEY

advised that STEWART had begun to furnish them with information

in 1958 but was not susceptible to direction and in SHANLEY's

opinion did not furnish complete information concerning the

matters in question and when asked for specific instances to

back up information became vague on names of people and exact

times, although he did cooperate with Customs for awhile.
