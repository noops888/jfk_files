JORN FELICE can give the orders to PRESSER. Although his

salary is not known to the informant, he feels certain that

PRESSER does not make the big money that many people attribute

to him.

PRESSER does not have any income outside of his union

money as far as he knows.

His wife, FAYE PRESSER, was just in Mt. Sinal Hospital

several weeks ago for a rest. She goes into the hospital about

twice a year for this purpose.

She still 1s a big gambler,

goes big for the horses and just as big for cards.

She has

been nabbed a couple times while participating in a couple of

"RED" MASON's poker games, where other women players took part

In these games set up by MASoN.

ALLEN FRIEDMAN, FAYE's brother, does some gambling,

but not like his brother, HARRY, who 18 a real "horse degen-

He follows the horses

all over the country.

He does

not attend the local area tracks very much.

He has said that

around here he could fix one jockey, but

then there are other

guys who would be fixing two or three jockeys in the same race.

Informant believed that he has been at

the California tracks

during this past winter and may still be out there.

PRESSER, HARRY FRIEDMAN's daughter, who with her brother were

adopted

by the PRESSERs, will be getting married shortly to a

Jewish fellow who drives a truck on some type of business

route.

JACKIE PRESSER is in the vending machine business

with an uncle, MILION PRESSER. They are doing well financially.

This is one of the few occasions on which WILLIAM PRESSER has

allowed anybody to use his name and union connection. He has

allowed JACKIE to mention in his vending machine contacts that
