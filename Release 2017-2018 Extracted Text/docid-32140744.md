Last year SHIRAKOVA visited the United Kingdom with a

party of Soviet teachers,

arriving on 2nd September and leaving

on 30th September, 1967.

We were thus able to discover her

patronymic, and her correct age - in spite of telling our source

that she was born in 1939, her birthdate was given

on

arrival here

as 18th January, 1937 A copy of the photograph attached to her

visa application is enolosed for ShIRakOVA

this woman, and have confirned that she spent à considerable

of time with him while in this country.

ingeniously or ingenuously, we are not

there is a waxwork of Lee OSWALD.

cola our source that she had known OSWALD, thus clearing up any doubts

in our minds about this identification S
