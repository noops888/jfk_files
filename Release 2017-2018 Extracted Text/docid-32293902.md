CARLOS MARCELLO, aka;

SA PATRICK J. COLLINS, JR. - VICTIM

AFO

USA LOUIS C. LACOUR, Eastern District of Louisiana,

New Orleans, confidentially advised 11/20/67 that he had a

private discussion with Federal District Judge FREDERICK J. R

HEEBE, EDLA.

Judge HEEBE advised that he is transferring

for trial.

Judge HEEBE is

as he has determined the best method of conducting the

transfer without raising the question of "reversible error"

on his part. Judge HEEBE pointed out to USA LACOUR that

MARCELLO had raised an issue hitherto unraised in law when

he filed

a motion for change of venue and then attempted to

rescind the motion.

Judge HEEBE feels that MARCELLO, no matter what

happens, will appeal on the grounds that he has a right to

be tried in the jurisdiction where the offense occurred, as

per the 6th Amendment to the Constitution.

Judge HEEBE

stated that under the 6th Amendment, MARCELLO also has the

right to

a fair and impartial trial and MARCELLO claimed, at

the hearing, that he could not get a fair and impartial trial

due to Life magazine articles

relative to him and subsequent

statements by the Louisiana Governor.
