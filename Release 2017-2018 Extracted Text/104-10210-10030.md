E. ((Asks for a cigarette; speaks in a very low volce.)) You know, I vest

so say a vord about Soretsi, Prosorstiy tray.

You know, it 18 not just sy menory

....

It is another thing -- pochays i en confuse: alout the kray, kut there is

sonthing conr-cted with "Soretst ij tin oe. (Frizorckly) -- either

primorrkly Rayon or Sovets By the Era.

tra why?

You knox, I was thinking -- must in it:

Somehca I have connected Soretck with Erloorsily.

The thing is that yourself sull, 'Fore 1o Soretsk" ....

There are nany Sovetsks ....

"Here is Sovetsli." -- apparentin, in all proiability, to lifferenciate this

Sovetsk fron another .. this vetst.

I have in mind the Sovetsk "by the sea (priorsily)", In order to differentiate

it fros another -- this is way, in no memory, Soveteis 13 bosethira connected

with "primorskly (by the sea)" ... either "Soretsk Prisorsity" or "Soretsk of

Prinorskly Rayon"' ... bell, jovetsi by the sas.

Now, another thing -- this Sortsk in a very stall place; it is not even a

cits; there was no rauken tiere ... nothing.

well, precisely, "Sovetsk by the sea", in ty serory....

in l'ell, if "Sovetisk by the sea", wiat else?

B. It could be this way ... It could he this way ....

I do not remender, I do not remember.

It could be this ... "Kaliningrad Oblast, City of Soretsk by tke sea" or

"of Primoroissy Rayon"... I do not know.

I, how ... vell, Sovetsk ty the sea... It poisted out "Sovetsk -- by the sea".

In цу тепогу, 1t 16 "Sovetsk, Prisorskly Kray".

...+.

I myself understand: you have reprosched le for my ignorance -- that I do

not koow geography, although i graduated frou an institute ....

I know very well that there is only one Prinorskly Kray -- in the Far Best;

there 16 no Primorskly Kray here.
