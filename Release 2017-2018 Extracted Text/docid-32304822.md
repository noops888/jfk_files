AR - CONSPIRACY

Re Bureau airtel to New York 8/1/63, copy to this office.

The revelations of JOSEPH VALACHI have received con-

siderable prominence in recent editions of newspapers across Canada

and on this date the Legat was contacted by Assistant Commissioner

AL PARSONS, Director, Operations and Criminal Investigations,

PARSONS had just been talking with Superintendent

in charge of criminal investigations branch for

the RCMP in Montreal, Quebec. THIVIERGE, in turn, advised PARSONS

he had just had a discussion concerning the revelations of VALACHI

with Chief ROBERT, Montreal City Police Department.

According to

ROBERT,

sources of the Montreal Police Department indicate the

Montreal underworld is "extremely restless" as a

result of the

publicity attendant to the VALACHI matter.

Assistant Commissioner PARSONS said to date no information

has been received by the Force or by the Montreal PD which would

indicate the revelations of VALACHI included identities of the

Canadian underworld element. PARSONS requested the writer to be

certain if at all possible that the RCMP be kept advised of any and

all information of interest to Canadian authorities resulting from

information obtained from VALACHI. This request is being brought to

the attention of the Bureau and it would be greatly appreciated if

it could be borne in mind and this office advised of any such

information received which may be so disseminated.
