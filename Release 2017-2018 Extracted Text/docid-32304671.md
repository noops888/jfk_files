Argentina, and that he still exerts some influence in the

"organization" in the United States. Subsequently on

1/28/64,

a request was made of the Bureau to contact either

INS or the

State Department for a visitor's visa for

PINDILLI.

By letter dated. 2/5/64 the Bureau advised that

inasmuch as PINDILLI was deported on two occasions in 1931

and 1947 and has had his application for re-entry rejected

by INS on several occasions subsequent to that time, that

it would appear that he had been away from the United States

for too long a period of time to be in any position to gain

the full confidence of members of the Cleveland "organization".

The letter indicated that these individuals in control

Cleveland at present were not in control when PINDILLI

was active and

as a result would not confide in him concerning

their activities, or CAVBOMB.

In a subsequent contact with CV 344-0, he

advised that CICCIO MILANO was in control of the Cleveland

"organization" at the time GUISSEPPI

PINDILLI was in the

Cleveland area.

He stated he still exerts influence

from Mexico, where he is currently residing:

The Cleveland

"organization", according to the informant,

1s run by

ANTHONY (NIÑO) MILANO, arid he is held in such high respect

by members of

the "organization" that members address

constant contact

throughout the United States with members of the "organization"

and still is to this day through correspondence.

Informant

stated that from the time the PINDILLI family moved to

Warren, Ohio, from Pennsylvania, in about 1933, until

PINDILLI's departure in 1947, PINDILLI was in an älmost

constant travel status for the "organization" throughout

the United States and informant pointed out that PINDILLI

did still have and did

still exert influence.

He again

cited the example of the incident at Mansfield, Ohio, when

he himself was in trouble,

that all it took was a letter from

PINDILLI to ANTHONY MILANO in Cleveland

to get results.

Informant also stated that while he operated a

house of prostitution in Reading, Pa., in 1957 and 1958, he

Reading, Pa., in the Shenendoah area, who was aware of

PINDILLI's location in Argentina and who looked up the

informant on the request of PINDILLI. He also stated

AMATO was high enough in the "organization" and close

enough in the "organization" to the "top" to have attended

the funeral of ALBERT ANASTASIA, who was murdered in New

York City. He was apparently of the same "family"

Reference is made to the report of SA JAMES P.

FLYNN, dated 7/1/63 at New York captioned "IA COSA NOSTRA,

aka., AR - CONSPIRACY", wherein on page 82 one AMANO, FNU,

is mentioned as being a member of the GAMBINO family, of

which the deceased ALBERT ANASTASIA was also a member.

Page 28

of this same report reflects that ANASTASIA, to protect

CHARLES CAVALIARO, had him transferred to VINCENZO MANGANO'S

Borgata.

Page 27 of the report reflects that MANGANO and

ANASTASIA had been "consiglierj" in Cleveland under CICCIO

MILANO.

The above is noted

as it

shows the closeness

of PINDILLI with the "organization" and to CAVALLARO.

Informant also stated FRANK DE AUGUSTINI,

second

in command to ANTHONY MILANO in Cleveland, on his last contact

with CV 344-0, remarked that the informant looked good for

his age, and the informant stated he asked DE AUGUSTINI hOW

he knew

how old he was.

DE AUGUSTINI told informant his '

exact birth date and said, "I know all about you because" I

was with your father when he took your mother".

It is to be

noted that informant's mother was married to another Italian,

and had a daughter by this marriage and informant's father

wanted her for his wife and took herjaway from her husband

and daughter and began living common law after which the

informant and, three brothers and a sister were born.

that TRIPODI is a personal friend of PINDILLI's and it was

due to the close relationship between GUISSEPPI PINDILLI

and TRIPODI that TRIPODI granted this authority to the

NUMBERS LOTTERY", Bufile 162-266, wherein on page 38 of the

report information is contained

in Steubenville and exerts influence in some parts of

west Virginia.
