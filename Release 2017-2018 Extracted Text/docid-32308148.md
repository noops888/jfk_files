EXTREME CAUTION SHOULD BE USED CONCERNING

INFORMATION FURNISHED BY THIS INFORMANT AND IF THE INFORMATION

IS USED IN ANY MANNER,

IT SHOULD BE PARAPHRASED SO AS NOT TO

COMPROMISE THIS VALUABLE SOURCE.

The informant advised that THOMAS W. "TEDDY" GLEASON,

President, International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) ,

was in CONNIE NOONAN's office with an individual who has been

definitely identified as ALBERT ACKALITIS and AUSTIN FUREY

(Vice-President, Local 1730, ILA) .

The majority of the

conversation is

between GLEASON and ACKALITIS; there is only

one comment from FUREY. Because of the scope of the

conversation and the fact that certain phrases were inaudible,

the conversation is being set forth verbatim.

From the above it appears that ACKALITIS was

referring to Congressman JOHN J. MURPHY and that he

resented MORPHY's refusal to go along with his proposition.

"They got another guy (inaudible) why don't you

do something for him? We could use him.

AA:

"I already spoke for him (inaudible). 'I spoke

with MC GUIRE's man. How about DE COLA (ph) on the Island?"

AA:

"He's got no work at all. 'In a month or two, yeh."

TG :

soon. I'll appreciate it.

(on the way out of NOONANts office) "Check with me

In the outside office, AGKALITIS is heard to

"See you, AUSTIE" and AUSTIN FUREY replies "See you, AChi, Bay

From the above it appears that GLEASON and ACKALITIS

are placing men in employment with the Operating Engineers

union, Local 15.

It is noted that TOM MC GUIRE is the Business

Manager of Local 15.. NY is attempting to identify DE COLA.

Newark is requested to attempt to identify LOUIE

LOMBARDI and to furnish any information available about a union

charter either issued to CHARLIE "THE JEW" YANOWSKI or over

which YANOWSKI had control. In addition, Newark is

requested to supply any information reflecting that GYr DE

CARLO, TEDDY GLEASON and ACKALITIS, are collaborating in

any ventures.

Ny will contact Ny 1716-c to determine whether

an assessment from companies or employees is scheduled by

Local 1730, ILA. NY will also attempt to identify charter

allegedly given by LESTER CONNELL of the IBT.
