1. On 10 January 1974 the WH/2/GS desk received the

referenced

memorandum from the Domestic Collection Division

Indicating the Miami fleld office had been in contact with one

Joseph R. MEROLA. MEROLA had just returned from a business

trip

to El Salvador; and he reported that a friend of his had

identified a Mrobl

pin the Political Section of the

American Embassy in San Salvador as a suspect ClA representative.

Headquarters traces on Joseph R. MEROLA Indicated that on several

occasions in/the past MEROLA had claimed that he was a CIA

agent.

The 1

I the Mrel

referred to

above, was recently questioned regarding any Embassy contaçt

with MEROLA while the latter was in San Salvador.

The I

727

stated that both within the Embassy community and at soctal

functions MEROLA had frequently referred to his contact with

the CIA, past and present. He also volunteered this infor

mation to a former

contact.

In light of the above, it would appear that MEROLA

had taken advantage of his agency contacts in an inappropriate

manner to the potential embarrassment of the

1626

He would, accordingly, appreciate

that this be given

due consideration

in your assessment of the advantage of your

continued contact with his.
