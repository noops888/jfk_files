DCI Sources and Methods Authority With Respect

to JFK Assassination Records

Prossane

1. Per your request, I have attached a copy of the

President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of

1992 (ARCA), Pub. L. 102-526, 106 Stat.

3443-3458, repriried at

44 U.S.C. § 2107 note.

For your convenience, I have higkigheed

the pertinent provisions that will aid in responding to an

inquiry regarding the statute's effect on the DCI's statutory

autrority to protect intelligence sources and methods.

2.

The clear language and intent of the law is to supe-sede

statutes that prohibit disclosure of information, except for some y:

irrelevant subject areas, such

tax records.

The statute

provides that "it shall take

precedence over

any other law

(except section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code), judicial

decision construing such law, or common law doctrine that would

otherwise prohibit" the disclosure of information subject to the

ARCA § 11(a). This language, taken with the provisions

discussed below which limit the intelligence

sources and metrods

thai may be protected and set a strict procedural scheme by which

information is to be reviewed under the ARCA,

effectively

supersedes the DCI's National Security Act authority with respect v

to intelligence sources and methods information subject to the

ARCA.

3.

Section 6 of the ARCA provides the grounds for which the

release of information may be "postponed."

The statute

contemplates that all information will eventually be released.

Indeed, it specifies that all information will be made available

to the public no later than 25 years after the passage of the

ARCA (which occurred in October 1992) unless the president

certifies that continued postponement is necessary.

ARCA

§ 4(g) (2) (D).

With respect to intelligence-related information,

ARCA allows postponement if:

" (1) the threat to ... intelligence operations

... is

of such gravity that it outweighs

the public interest, and

such public disclosure would reveal-.

tion, it is important to emphasize and clarify the legislative intent

and importance of particular provisions of the Act

Defining assassination records

'Assassination records" are defined in Section 3. The definitic

f "assassination records" is a threshold consideration for the su

cessful implementation of the Act. Its scope will be the barometer .

of public confidence in the release of assassination records. While

the records of past presidential commissions and congressional

committees established to investigate the assassination of President

Kennedy are included as assassination records under this Act, it is

intended and emphasized that the search and disclosure of records

under this Act must go beyond those records. While such records

are valuable, they reflect the views, theories, political constraints,

and prejudices of past inquiries. Proper implementation of this Act

and providing the American public with the opportunity to judge

he surrounding history of the assassination for themselves

re

uires including not only, but going beyond, the records of the

Warren and Rockefeller Commissions, and the Church and House

Select Assassination Committees.

The term

bout the universe of records would have been premature, an

ould have further injected the government between the record

government offices will begin to organize and review their records..:

before the Review Board is established. Government offices are re-

quired to begin the review and disclosure of records upon enact-

ment to expedite public access to the many records which do not

require additional review or postponement. However, the ultimate

work of the Review Board will involve not only the review of

records recommended for postponement, but requiring government

ifices to provide additional intormation and records, where appro

riate. Guidance, especially that developed in consultation with the

public, scholars, and affected government offices, will prove valua-

ble to ensure the fullest possible disclosure and create public confi-

dence in a working definition that was developed in an independ-

ent and open manner.

Autopsy Records

The Act specifically excludes from the definition

of "assassi

nation records"

the autopsy records and copies or reproductions

made from such records donated by the Kennedy family pursuant

to a deed of gift executed on October 29, 1966. These records in-

clude the autopsy photographs and X-rays of President Kennedy.

The Committee believes that this exclusion is a sound policy. The

Committee believes that there is a compelling justification for pro-

tecting the privacy of the Kennedy family from the unwarranted

The Assassination Records Review Board is an independent

agency within the executive branch. The five-member Review

Board will be appointed by the President with the advice and con-

of government offices and agencies, and the possible need for addi-

tional time or authority from Congress.

IV. BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION

On November 22, 1963,

ated. It was a tragic and definine moment in American histor

he desire by the American public to understand who assassinate

President Kennedy, and why, has resulted in several official inves-

cigations and a broad spectrum of private inquiries and scholar

ship. Unfortunately, in the eyes of the public, each investigatior

and inquiry served to raise additional questions, and did so while

increasing the volume of secret government records about the as

sassination. In 1992, the public demand, fostered by increased

ognition by the Congress

records related to the assassination of President Kennedy should be

fully disclosed.

In addition to the legislation considered by the Committee, and

its counterpart considered by the House Committee on Government

Operations, four other related,

though more limited, measures:

were introduced in the House of Representatives in 1992. Two bills

mandating the release of all Kennedy assassination investigation

in their entirety...and no portion withheld solely on

we have declared non-relevant that is operational and is

clearly non-relevant we should argue strongly with the

Board. The Director's

statutory responsibility for the

protection of sources and methods must be defended; and we

can be sure that it was not anticipated that a KGB officer

in Mexico City would be transferred to another country and

go on generating much operational information. Furthermore,

we saw it as the

Board's responsibility to review the

records we identified as non-relevant and to support --

publicly those of our decisions that they felt were

justified!

Lise you, I am very concemed about the breadth of the rag's refinitions The key in keep in mind is the

OGC- 95-50522

1 March 1995

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Historical Review Group

FROM:

Robert J. Eatinger, JI.

Assistant General Counsel

Litigation Division, OGC

SUBJECT:

Comments on JFK Assassination Records Proposed

Regulation

1.

The following are my comments on the Assassination

Records Review Boards proposed interpretive regulations published

in the Federal Register on 8 February 1995.

The term assassination record is defined in the

President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of

1992, Pub.L. 102-525, 106 Stat. 3443, Oct. 26, 1992, reprinted at

44 U.S.C. § 2107 note (the Act). Any interpretive definition by

the Board cannot exceed that in the Act. The Acts definition is

found in Section 3(2) and provides:

(a) Assassination record means a record that is related to

the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, that was

created or made available for use by, obtained by, or

otherwise came into possession of

various Federal, State, or local government bodies.

3. The proposed regulation is broader than that in the Act.

The proposed regulation includes as assassination records:

records, public and private, regardless of how labeled or

identified, that document, describe, report, analyze, or

interpret activities and events that may have led to the

ADMINISTRATIVE/ INTERNAL USE ONLY

---

## Page 27

ADMINISTRATIVE - INTERNAL USE ONLY

assassination of President John F. Kennedy; the

assassination itself; and investigations of or inquiries

into the assassination.

$ 1400.1(a). This language in overbroad in two respects. First,

the phrase events that may have led to is both broader than

relates to as in the Act and provides no articulable standard.

For instance, the theme in the Oliver Stone movie JFK appears to

be that President Kennedy was assassinated as a result of a

conspiracy to keep the war in Vietnam from winding down.

Under

the proposed regulation, the Board might consider all records

concerning the war in Vietnam during the Kennedy Administration

as being assassination records.

Without a standard, the phrase

is permits arbitrary and inconsistent application.

Third, it

includes information about investigations and inquiries other

than those conducted by those entities identified in the Act.

Although the Board states that it is following the intent of

Congress in seeking the most comprehensive disclosure of records

related to the assassination, it appears the Board may be

exceeding its authority.

4. The definition further states that assassination record

includes, without limitation

... all records as defined in Sec.

3(2) of the ARCA.

See § 1400.1 (b) (1). Thus, by its terms it

exceeds the statutory definition.

Further, it is unhelpful

because by refusing to limit itself to any articulable class of

records it remains unlimited and subject to constant

re-interpretation by the Board.

5. The proposed definition of additional information and

records under proposed $ 1400.2 is objectionable because the

regulation does not provide the intended use of the definition.

The Board may be attempting to provide a definition useful in

interpreting the Boards authority under §7(j) (1) (C) (ii) of the

Act:

The Review Board shall have the authority to act in a manner

prescribed under this Act Including authority to ... direct

i Government office to make available to the Review Board

and if necessary investigate the facts surrounding,

additional information, records, or testimony from

individuals,

which the Review Board has reason to believe is

required to

, fulfill its functions and responsibilities under

this Act....

(Emphasis added.) If this is the case, the Board should

expressly so state and provide opportunity for informed comment

on that application.

For instance, -proposed § 1400.2 (a) includes

all documents used by the agency during its declassification

review.

This definition could include requests for legal advice

on particular matters.

Such advice would be protected within the

particular agency by attorney-client privilege and should not be

provided to an extra-agency body.

Proposed Regs by JFK Assassination Records Review Board

Page and I are very concerned about the overly broad reach of the proposed regulations of the JFK Board. I have prepared specific

comments that l will send by separate cover. In essence, we are concerned that the regs reach too far into Agency records and stray too

ar from the definition of an "assassination record" in the law. What input does CIA have into this process and what are the tim

onstraints? It looks like a power grab. It seems to us that Cohen should engage immediately in his role as Chair of the Agency Releas

Dear David,

We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the

Assassination Records Review Board's proposed interpretive

egulations as published in the Federal Register

February

8, 1995.

We recognize the value of providing guidance foi

those who are responsible for implementing the Assassination

Records Collection Act.

Our general view is that the regulations are

comprehensive in identifying the range of records that woul

ootentially be relevant to the JFK assassination or the

scope of the investigations into the assassination.

In a few sections of the regulations the wording seems

somewhat overly broad or the meaning is not clear. Attached

for the Board's consideration are comments on these

sections.

In some parts of the text we suggest possible

in wording for purposes of clarification.

We would be pleased to discuss these comments at the

Board's convenience.

It is our intention to continue

cooperating fully with the Board and to make every effort to

release assassination records held by the Agency.

Following are CIA's comments on specific sections of the

Assassination Records Review Board's interpretive

regulations, as published in the Federal Register, February

8,

1995.

1.

Section 1400.1 Interpretation of Assassination Record

In paragraph

(a) the reference to "activities and events

that may have led to the assassination--*

seems overly

broad, and appears to go beyond the limits established in

the Assassination Records Collection Act. We believe that

it would be helpful to include an articulable standard in

The

present text would permit inconsistent

application of the regulations, which might encourage

massive and expensive, additional records searches that are

of doubtful value.

The following change is suggested in paragraph (a):

"activities and events that may reasonably be

considered to have led to the assassination--"

(This would

be consistent with the Act.)

2.

Section 1400.2 Interpretation of additional records and

information

Paragraph (a) raises a question as to the purpose and

definition of "additional records and information.

The

meaning of the phrase "all documents used--during

declassification review of assassination records as well as

all other documents--"seems unclear. Is it the intention to

include any document, book, index, record system, etc.

regardless of relevance to the assassination or

investigations, including for example, legal opinions ? We

assume that the purpose is to enable the Board to request

and review

additional records.

We suggest that the section be made more specific,

including a clearer statement of the intent.

For example,

with

respect to cryptonyms,

codewords, guides, etc. a more

• precise link to events related to the assassination or to a

timeframe could be helpful.

3.

Section 1400.5

Requirement that assassination records

be released

in their entirety

The introductory paragraph specifies that "no portions

of any assassination record shall be withheld--solely on

grounds of non-relevance."

This appears to open the door

for access to

entire documents that contain information on

sensitive activities even when the documents contain.

Information that is only incidental to the assassination,

such as a passing reference to a name.

There is a potential

risk that sensitive, non-relevant sources and methods would

be compromised.

We suggest that the Board consider adding wording to this

section that accommodates those instances when there is a

to release ample information from a document to

disclose assassination-related material, while still

protecting obviously unrelated, sensitive information. The

Board, of course, would continue to have access to the

entire record.

4. Section 1400.7 Additional guidance

Paragraph (d)

states "any records identified with

respect to a particular person also includes any records for

This appears to require that all records on any individuals

available.

Is the objective really to assure that all files

on an individual or activity be made available regardless of

the labels on the files? If so, we suggest that the text be

modified to reflect this.

In the letter to David, I would add at the end of the third

paragraph:

"Our Office of General Counsel provided some legal comments

on the scope of the definition that we've included in the

attached. "

overriding effect on other statutory grants of power found

necessary in the interests of national security, such as the

National Security Act's direction that the Director of Central

Intelligence protect intelligence sources and methods from

unauthorized disclosure.

The ARCA provides a statutory standard

for protecting or "postponing" intelligence sources and methods"

that applies only to "assassination records."

The standard in

the ARCA restricts those sources and methods that can be

protected in assassination records.

The Review Board is given

the ultimate authority to apply that standard, subject to being

overridden only by the President.

Thus, the ARCA reflects a

congressional desire to limit the DCI's

authority to protect

sources and methods, but only for "assassination records" as ARCA

defined it. An interpretive definition by the Board that would

sweep in records not covered by the Act, we believe, would exceec

the Board's limited rulemaking authority.

Thus, the proposed

definition should be limited more clearly to those records

identified by Congress as

Comments--ARRB Proposed Interpretive Regulationg

1.

I have reviewed the proposed interpretive regulations

drafted by the Assassination Records Review Board, particularly

the sections addressing the ARRB's interpretation of the scope of

certain provisions of the Assassination Recorde Collection Act.

While I have commente on a number of sections, there is one

section in particular which raises serious concerns--principally

1400.2 regarding additional information and records.

2.

As presently worded, this section opens up significant

records which have nothing to do per se with the assassination.

and which are currently protected by various laws, including the

National Security Act of 1947, and, moreover, are exempt from

disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.

For example, (d) Organizational charts of government agencies.

(e) Records necessary and sufficient to describe the

the

• Agency's:

(1) Records policies and schedules;

(2) Filing systems and organization, and

(3) Storage facilities and location.

tems (a) and (b) of thia section (1400.2) also pose simila

roblems in that (a) includes all documents used by agencie

during their declassification review...Thie includes alz

materials including omnibus classitication guides or other

materials (1.e. not merely those prepared for use in the JEk

review) which would identify sensitive material across the board.

similarly, item (b) includes materials "created or used by

agencies

in furtherance of their review...."

This entire section

should at a minimum be restricted to items created by agencies

for use in the assassination reviews.

For example, if the Do has

a master list of cryptonyms, some of which appear in JEr

documents, only the subset should be included. Generic

categories of information which stand alone on their own merite

should be omitted.

1. In general there is not much in the regulation to cause the DA undo concern except for Sec. 1400.2 Interpretation of

additional records and information; specifically (e), (11, (2), & (3). The schedules are classified in the agregate, filing systems and

organization structures are classified in toto, and the storage facility is an Agency Records Center at a classified location. I know this

Do not agree with "no portions of any

of non-relevance." See Section 1400.5.

Non-relevant material should not have to

MEMORANDUM FOR:

Mr. Periera

FROM:

Gary Breneman

SUBJECT:

Comments on Proposed Rules, 36 CFR

Part 1400, Concerning JFK Records

Collection Act of 1992

1. You asked that I review subject proposed rules and

provide my thoughts and concerns. This is in response to

that request.

As a general statement, the proposed rules are not

well written and seem to try to cast the biggest net

possible.

With reference to poor draftsmanship,

note that

at Sec. 1400.2, they introduce a term "additional information

and records,

and describe what the term includes.

Compare

sections 1400.3 relating to "sources" and 1400.4 relating to

"(t)ypes of materials."

In the latter, they have reversed

the term and used "additional records and information."

While the intent is fairly clear, it causes one to wonder

what they had in mind.

3. With reference to the big net approach, it is a

basic rule of statutory and regulatory drafting to not write

laws and regulations which cannot be enforced. In this

regard, I know of no authority in U.S. law, including the

JFK Act, which would give the Board jurisdiction over

records which "may be located at, or under the control

Of,

...

"(foreign governments."

See 1400.4 (b). I have a

similar concern with respect to "private"

records. Cf. Sec.

1400.1 (a).

4. On the nonsensical side of the big net approach is

every book, magazine and newspaper article and which has

ever been written that may "report, analyze, or interpret"

the assassination.

See 1400.1 (a).

If read literally, the

Agency would have to give up all of its collections of

private books, etc. which fall within this definition.

This

is particularly true of those books we referred to here

within HRG for information and understanding as we conducted

the review.

See 1400.2 (a) - (a)ll documents used by

government offices and agencies during their

declassification review of assassination records..."

---

## Page 48

With specific reference to the requirement of

1400.2 (a), the Agency should be concerned about its records

within the

Do which tie crypts to true names of projects and

alias' and pseudos to the true names of individuals.

Because we regularly called the DO office responsible for

these matters for assistance in identifying the projects and

names behind the crypts and alias,' this subsection would

seem to place those document holdings within the reach of

the Board. This needs to be addressed.

Turning to 1400.7 (d), the Agency should be very

careful here.

In HRG's review and release of documents, we i

have often given out an alias but protected the true name.

In others, we have given out the true name but protected the

alias or pseudo.

This section seems to vitiate that effort

and needs to be addressed.

6. I have several thoughts on the non-relevant issue

which would take several more paragraphs.

Suffice it to

say, carried to its extreme, if the Board can in any way

make the case a document is an assassination record, then

they are

entitled to access to it and may direct its

release.

I would be pleased to discuss any of these items

with you if you wish.

(b) (2) "All records...or segregated by all

(means all "microfilm" documents are assassination records,

and will have to be reviewed

and accounted for even if we

are successful in "postponing" most of these records]

1400.2

Interpretation of additional records and

information.

(a) "All documents used by government offices and

agencies during their declassification review of

assassination records as well as

all other documents,

indices, records, and other material that disclose

cryptonyms, code tames, or other identification material in

assassination records.

[Section (a) is too inclusive; as written would include ANY

locument, book, index, record system or other material

consulted or "used" during the review, regardless of

relevance

to JFK assassination.

In fact, most of the

material

"used" in the review was used to determine if

information/names/etc. had been previously released and had

nothing to do with the assassination or investigations.

Also the part of the statement following "as well as" needs

clarification.

Are they asking for all records that contain

information on individuals mentioned in assassination

records or are they asking for the records/indices/etc. that

were

used to identify individuals mentioned by crypt or code

name in assassination records.

I the amendment recommended by FBI covers CIA concerns;

ideally the word "used"

should be changed to "created"]

(d) & (e) ladd

these records such as

"at the time of the assassination and

1400.5 Requirement that assassination records be released in

their entirety.

An assassination record shall be disclosed in its

from public disclosure solely on grounds of non-relevance.

[If this applies to an "individual" assassination record

then there is no problem. However, if it applies, as I

suspect, to files and groups of records then we have a major

problem of privacy and source protection with the OP and 201

files. It may be possible to

"postpone" the 201 and OP

files under the Privacy exemption and National Security deal

the FBI approach to amending the regulation

with "incidental appearance of assassination material" seems

a better approach. Our proposed amendment should include

"files" as well as "records".

1400.6 Originals and Copies

(a) (2) add "available" after "the earliest generation

print"

(b) in cases where a copy, as defined in paragraph (a)

of this section is authorized... the board may...require a

certified copy.

1400.7 Additional guidance

(d). Any records identified with respect to a

particular person also includes any records for that person

by any other name, pseudonym, codeword, symbol, number or

cryptonym..•

[This needs clarification. It the goal of this section is.

to ensure that all files on an individual/pröject are

provided regardless of how filed (under name, crypt,

etc.)

then I do not see a problem.

However, with out clarifying

language, this section could lead to the type of situation

described by Gloria. FBI also requested clarification.]

## Page 51

Issues:

Non-related (36,000+ pages) and OP (10,000 pages) material

in microfilm collection

The "segregated" records statement negates our claim that

material in the Microfilm is "non-related".

We can point

out that the HSCA requested, but did not review a lot of

these records and that access was given to complete files

even thought the request dealt with specific events or

timeframes.

However, given their objective of going

"beyond" previous investigations, I not sure this would have

any impact.

A different approach would be to deny or postpone personnel

type files including 201s that are not related to the

assassination (guidelines to be established in consultation

with the Board as unwarranted invasion of privacy and/or

protection of sources.

Approximately 25,000 pages of the

Non-related material are from 201 files; the remaining

10,000+ pages are from organization and project files.

Comments re Assassination Records Review Board's Interpretive

Regulations

1. I have reviewed the draft comments prepared for the Agency regarding the AARB's

proposed

interpretive regulations and believe some modifications are in order.

2. First and foremost, the comments regarding Section 1400.2 do not adequately address the concerns previously raised regarding the

unbrided inclusion of categories of records that have nothing to do with JFK's assassination, e.., organization charts, records schedules,

filing systems, etc. This section should

of information which stand alone on their merits should be included. This section is overly broad

and inclusive. (Please see the discussion in my 1 March memorandum.) Contrary to the proposed

comment that the intent of this section is "unclear", I think it is eminently clear, and that's the problem.

I think our concerns would be better served by raising in terms of scope rather than intent. Also

recommend against asking questions such as "Is it the intent...?" Heck, yes! Would suggest wording

along the lines-"As presently worded, this section would appear to include..."

3. The proposed comment on Section 1400.7 opens the door to all records on a person vice those

relevant to the assassination inquiries. Do we really want to set ourselves up for the obvious response to the question we are asking?

There are a number of different points here that need to be clarified, all dealing with scope. The board's legitimate concern that all

records on an individual records be addressed (regardless of how filed, e.g.under another name, pseudonym, etc. ). And an equally

legitimate Agency concern that

(i.e. other records on the individual may be), or 2. ) that all records on individuals who merely happen

investigation) should not be subsumed within the scope of these

Bob's comments should be included in our response to

the Board

existing text; I think his comments will work better as a

separate paragraph or as an addendum.

2)

DI IRO

Kathy's comments on section 1400.2 are on target, but a

little strong. I don't think the board will buy changed

Our proposed response, as written,

does question the scope but not directly.

(note:

The FBI

if accepted by the board, would

satisfactorily limit the scope of this section).

She does

have a point in changing "intent" to "as presently worded".

On section 1400.7, Kathy's reaction is the same as

Gloria's.

I think our

response adequately address the

concerns here, but could be strengthen without changing the

tone of the response. (Note - OGC comments will also address

"scope" which clearly is Kathy's primary concern.

Mr. David Marwell

Dear David,

We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the

1o as cognite Chi value go propone grease are

those who are responsible for implementing the Assassination

Our general view is that the regulations are

comprehensive in identifying the range of records that would

potentially be relevant to the JFK assassination or the

scope of the investigations into the assassination.

In a few sections of the regulations the wording seems

somewhat overly broad or the meaning is not clear. Ättached

for the Board's consideration are comments on these

sections.

In some parts of the text we suggest possible

changes in wording for purposes of clarification.

We would be pleased to discuss these comments at the

Board's convenience.

It is our intention to continue

cooperating fully with the Board and to make every effort to

release assassination records held by the Agency.

## Page 57

Following are CIA's comments on specific sections of the

Assassination Records Review Board's interpretive

regulations, as published in the Federal Register, February

8, 1995.

1.

Section 1400.1 Interpretation of Assassination Record

In paragraph (a) the reference to "activities and events

that may have led to the

broad, and appears to go beyond the limits established in

the Assassination Records Collection Act. We believe that

this section.

of doubtful value.

The following change is suggested in paragraph (a) :

"activities and events that may reasonably be

considered to have led to the assassination--"

(This would'

be consistent with the Act.)

2.

Section 1400.2 Interpretation of additional records and

information

Paragraph

l (a) raises a question as to the purpose and

definition of

"additional records and information."

The

meaning of the phrase "all documents used--during

declassification review of assassination records as well as

all other documents--"seems unclear.

Is it the intention to

include any document, book, index, record system, etc.

regardless or relevance to the assassination or

investigations, including for example, legal opinions? We

assume that the purpose is to enable the Board to request

and review additional records.

We suggest that the section be made more specific,

including a clearer statement of the intent. For example,

with

respect to cryptonyms, codewords, guides, etc. a more

precise link to events related to the assassination or to a

timeframe could be helpful.

3. Section 1400.5

Requirement that assassination records

be released in their entirety

The introductory paragraph specifies that "no portions

of any assassination record

shall be withheld--solely on

grounds of non-relevance."

This appears to open the doo

for access

co entire documents that contain information o

sensitive activities even when the documents contain

---

## Page 58

14-00000

information that is only incidental to the assassination,

such as a

passing reterence to a name.

There is a potential

risk that sensitive, non-relevant sources and methods would

be compromised.

We suggest that the Board consider adding wording to this

section that accommodates those instances when there is a

need to release ample information from a document to

disclose assassination-related material, while still

protecting obviously unrelated, sensitive information. The

Board, of course, would continue to have access to the

entire record.

4. Section 1400.7 Additional guidance

Paragraph (d) states "any records identified with

respect to a particular person also includes any records for

that person by any other name, pseudonym, codeword,

This appears to require that all records

on any individuals

who are merely mentioned in an assassination record be made

available.

Is the objective really to assure that all files

on an individual or activity be made available regardless of

the labels on the files? If so, we suggest that the text be

modified to reflect this.

Respinse A nunber of commentators

put forward criticisins along these linos.

Some uf these commentalars suggested

that some form of a "reasonably related"

stondard bo cubsululud for the "may

have led to" language, while others

suggesied altemative formulations (e 6.

"that may shed lipht on the

assassination"). In adopting and

eventually applying a "reasonably

related" standard, the Roview Board

does not seok to endorse or reject any

particular theory of the assassination of

President Kennedy, although such

theories may inform the Keview Board's

search for records roasonably related to

the assassination and investigations into

il. The Keview Board believes thet

Executive Directur. The Rewew Board

contemplates that, with rogard to such

Comment. The scope of additional

rocords and information shuuld

specifically include records und

-describe agencies' methods of

searching for records:

doscribe reclassification, transfor.

records; or

-do not constitute assassination

records, but have the potential lu

histurical recore of the assassination.

Response. To the eatent that the

inclusion of socords and information of

the sypor doscribed suuld assist thi

Review Board in meeting its

respunsitulties under the |Fk Act, the

Review Board has adoped the suggested

language

Comment. The scope of

"assession records" under $ 1400 1

and "additional records and

information" under $ 1400.2 should nol

extend to state and local guvummuni or

lo private records that are not in the

pussession of the Federal guvernment.

Response The Retrew Board

considered such comments caretulli.

but concluded that the lerms of the JFK

Act preclude the narrower reading of

Uie Keview Buard': responsibillies

urged by such comments. Sechon

1400.G allows the Review Board, in 1ls

discretion. to accep copies in lieu of

origanado The Reores Board believes

that this llesibilit addresses the

concerns of some commentalors about

the remuval uf original rurds alriady

housed. for chimple. in date or local

archives

Comment: Secton 1900.3 should

include as sources of assassination

records and additions records and

inturnation andividuals and

corporallons that pussess such material

ovan if not obtained from sourcus

identified in paragraphs (a) through (o)

thereuf, and should spocifically include

individuale and corporations that

cuntraciod to provide goods or services

1o the goverument.

Response: The Revow Board has

added paragrapl (D) to this secuon in

response to thuto comments. The

Review board has concluded that, in

viaw of paragraph (0, specifically

identilying goverment contractors or

other private persons would be

unnecessary and rodundant.

Comment. NARA contended has .

5 1400.4 should not include artifacts

among the types of materials included

in the term *"record " Treating artilacts

as "records" would be contrary lo

NARA's accustomed practice and the

unifo ul the lenn "rocords" in other

deas ol Federal records law and would

result in substantial practical

difficulties.

Hesponse: The Review Board has

carofully considered NARA's objectiuns

do lhe inclusion of artfacts as "records,"

but decided chat this inclusion is

necessary lo achievo the purposes of the

JFK Arl. Tha Review Board notes that

artifacts that bocamo exhibits to the

proceedings of the Warreu Connussion

have long been in the custody ui NAKA.

and decided that thoso artifacts should

remain in the JFK Assassination Recordi

Collection. The Revicw Board further

bulovos that the unique issues of public

trust and credibilily uf goverument

prucesses that prompted enactment of

the JFK Act require that arufaces be

included within the JFK Assassination

Records Collection. The strong support

that commenting members of the publi

gave to this position reinforces this

conclusion. Tho Kovier Board ancluded

an its proposed regulations, and retained

an g 1400.7(b)-(c) of tho final

interpretive regulatons, language

intended to addiess NARA's concurns

about potential copying requiremen

and preservation issues unnue 10

artifacts.

Comment: Section 1400.5 should be

mudilied lo allow agencies to withhold

from the JFK Assassination Records

Collection material that is not related to

the assassination of President Kennedy.

oren though at appoars in a record prat

cuntains other material that is relalod lo

Response: It remains the intent ot this

coction in matie: cloar lu agencies that, in

a rule, entire records, and not parts

thereal, are to becono part of tie jFk

purpose of requiring that records be
