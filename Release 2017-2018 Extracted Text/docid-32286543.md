NO 92-1029

On September 10, 1969, Mr. STILES BOURROUGHS

(protect), Commercial Department, Southern Bell Telephone

and Telegraph Company, Atlanta, Georgia, advised IC

MARION W? DAVIS of information pertaining to local

Atlanta area telephone numbers.

On September 19, 1969, LOIS OGLESBY (protect),

Southeastern Telephone Company, Fort Walton Beach,

Florida, is the individual who furnished the information

concerning the fact that telephone number 243-8770, a

non-published number, is listed to C. J. CERAVOLO,

104 Fourth Street N.W., Fort Walton Beach, Florida.

Information obtained from South Central Bell

Telephone and Telegraph Company on September 23, 1969,

was made available by Mr. M. I. GUIROVICH, Business

Manager, Lafayette, Louisiana.

On October 3, 1969, NO 1635-R (PROB) , advised

SA NATHAN O. BROWN that JUNIOR PROVENZANO has

recently

purchased a stable known as "Pretty. Oaks" which is located

under the Huey P. Long Bridge near Bridge City, Louisiana.

Source stated that PROVENZANO paid $12,000.00 for the

buildings and is leasing the land to the railroad.

Source stated he does not know why PROVENZANO

put this money into the stable as it does not appear

likely to bring a decent return for his investment,

noting that PROVENZANO spent every afternoon at the stable.

Source stated that he spoke with PROVENZANO

during the last week of September, 1969, at which time

PROVENZANO commented that the Feds had him completely

tied up on a jewelry deal and, therefore, had greatly

restricted his activity, but he did not elaborate further.

PCI

advised SA BENJAMINE

I. GRAVES on August 8, 1969, that

she had not seen DONALD

LESTER JAMES or any of his

associates at the lounge in

the Admiral Benbow Motel which is located on U.S. Highway

90 in Biloxi, Mississippi, during the past few weeks.

his associates and this may be the reason that JAMES

no longer frequents this motel.

31, 1969, dyis he sh

advised SA EDGAR L.

to Jackson,

Mississippi.
