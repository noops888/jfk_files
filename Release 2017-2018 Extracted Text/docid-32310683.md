GOODBODY AND COMPANY

NEW YORK CITY VICTIM

MAJOR THEFT

I talked with Assistant Director Malone at New York concerning

current developments. He advised me plans were made for the subject Gray,

who is acting as our informant, to pruceed to Miami with the Agents this

afternnon. Tentative plans, if all develops, are for the delivery of the

I| securitles tonight at Miaml, This is subject to change depending upon develop-

ments.

In view of the reference to the District Attorney's office of New York,

clarification was needed concerning this relationship. Malone advised me

that jesterday after he had been informed that the insurance company had

alerted the District Attorney's office to the possible solution of the case, he

called District Atturney Frank Hogan. Hogan stated that he had not been fully

informed by his men of the developments and that he was af preciative af

Malone's call. Malone told Hogan tr 't this was a matter wnich we planned to

handle and that we did not want any interference from the District Attorney's

office. He stated it was to be clearly understood at the outset either Hogan's

office or the FBI would handie the matter and that one or the other would be

completely out of the picture. Malone states there was complete understanding

from the New York District Attorney's G468 7-84051-26

that the Bl would handle the matter ang that there, would de no mighierence

Malone states the understanding with the insurance company is to

pay Gray $100, 000, contingent upon the subject or subjects heing arrested.

and the securities delivered. The insurance company feels :hat an arrest aid

return of the securities is tantamount to a conviction and would be willing to

pay the $100, 000 after tie contingencies are resolved.

Memorandum to Mr. De Loach

Re: UNKNOWN SUBJECTS

THEFT OF $2, 034, 69L. 25

In view of the importance of this case it was indicated that a national

press release would be made from Wastington and that the efforts of the

New York and Miami Offices should be ciosely coordinated

With reference te the two detectives going to Miami, this is a

matter solely to be determined by the District A"orney's difice, which clearly

understands that we do not plan to advise these. a detectives di any

developments, that they are not to be in on the arrest, nor are they to be

allowed to interview any subject or subjects until we decide to allow them to

do 80. Insolar as Hogan's office is concerned and any other agency, there

is to be a complete blackout until the deal is completed. After we slake our

news release we will then determise who will be given access to the subjects.

It is noted that after the subjects are arraigned they will be placed in custody

of the Marshal and if New Yor; asks for authority to allow the representatives

of the New York Policr. Department to talk to the subjects, this should be done

providing we have fuily and thoroughly gotten all facts developed in possession

of the subjects.

"diami and New York should clearly understand this and

Mr. Malone has this understanding.

Agent Nehrbass, who is the front man for the FBI, and Agent Casey,

who is the case Agent, are proceeding to Miami with Gray this afternoon.

Nehrbass, in addition to being given expente money, will also have a roll of

bills for front money, which he will use in case good faith is to be displayed,

A current development lends additional color to the case.

cache of narcotics was picked up by narcotics agents in liam: yesterday.

Involved in this was one Frankie Dio. His arrest got corsiderable publicity.

He was to be released on payment of $100, 000 bor. 1, which bond was subse-

quently reduced to $25,000, and Malone advised me this morning that it is

just a forma' before Dis is released today. This is significant wasmuch as

Gray last evening talked to Miami and stated that he had been in touch with

his contacts and the principals involved are Frankle io and fiorman Rothman.

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach

Re: UNKNOWN SUBJECTS (2)

THEFT OF $2, 034, 881. 25

Gray said that if Dio does not get out he is sure that Rothman will go through

with the deal. The news items indicate that Frankie Dio is the brother of

Johnny Dio, a notorious raciseteer in the New York area, whose name was

frequently mentioned in conr.ection with Hoffa investigations and with the

investigation of rackets in the New York area.

Malone also said there is a possibility that the delivery of the

securities r ly take place in New York. This could occur if the contact in

Miami if made and at this time Malone does, not know whewer there will be

a delivery in Miami or New York. I inquired of Malone as to whether there

fould be a violition if there is a payoff in New York City. He said that the

New York Office was going on the presumption that the information available

indicated the securities were in Miami and this is the basis for their

proceeding.

Under the avoie set of circumstances the interstate transportation

of the securities, which is a necessary element of the offense, does exist.

ACTION TO BE TAKEN:

New York and Miami Offices will need io closely coordinate all

activities. Bureau will be kept advised of all developments. Malone has

been instructed to go forward with the arrangements.
