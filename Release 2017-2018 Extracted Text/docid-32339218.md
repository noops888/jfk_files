in Rome, Italy, until February, 1953.

After fulfilling his

military obligations in the United States, he spent a short

time in west Germany and came to France on December 15, 1954

In Paris, GIBSON resided successively at 15 rue

Delambre, 31 rue de Seine and 93 rue Belliara, prior to

purchasing a small house at 10 Allee des Pommiers, Rosny-sous-

Bois, near

Paris, on November 9, 1957k

When he first came to France, GIBSON was

enrolled at the College of Letters of the

University of

Paris and at the Ecole Superieure de Preparation et de

Perfectionnement des Professeurs de Francais a l'Etranger

(Advanced School for Preparation and Improvement of Foreign

HARRINGTON, who was away from Paris for several

months, had allowed GIBSON, who was then single and living

in a hotel, the use of his apartment.

Violent arguments

took place between the two men in connection with the

apartment, and GIBSON resolved to seek revenge by trying

to bring about the expuleion of HAFRINGION from France.

For this purpose he sent to a weekly American publication

and to the British dally "The Observer"

•over the signature

. HARRINGION, violently anti-French articles which were

rinted in these publications and were of such nacure that

they could have brought about the expulsion of their

author from France

Upon being informed of the publication of

these articles of which he was not the author, HARRINGTON

located proof of the very probable guilt of GIBSON and

The resulting investigation, which

was conducted by the Polise Judiciaire (Criminal Police)

Surete Nationale, quickly led to the confession of

GIBSON, who admitted having tried to bring about the

expulsion of HARRINGTON, to whom he apologized

and who accepted the apology before withdrawing his complain'

Although the Agence France Presse did not

so specify, it appears logical that it was as a result of

this incident that GIBSON ceased working for that agency g

The investigation in connection with the

above matter, in addition to reflecting GIBSON's lack

of principles, also developed the following additional

deta11s g

It was learned from a source in the Agence

France Presse

that GIBSON was the animator of a group for

aid to cuba.

This report confirms another, received from

an American source,

to the effect that GIBSON was chairman

of the New York section of a crypto-Communist organization

called "Fair Play for Cuba Committee" which had as its

purpose astiation in lavor a the ChaIRo regime in cuba g
