Mrs. Mildred Stegall has requested a name check regarding

Mr. Peter Lisagor,

A check of the central files of the FBI disclosed that Mr. Lisagor

was born on August 5, 1915, at Keystone, West Virginia. Lie graduated from

the University of Michigan in 1939 and joined the staff of the "Chicago Daily News

as a reporter. He enlisted in the U. S. Army in June, 1942, and was dscharged

in November,

1945. During his military service he served as Editor of "Stars

and Stripes. " lie rejoined the staff of the "Chicago Daily News" after his dis-

charge from the Army in 1945. Mr. Lisagor was assigned to the "Chicago Daily

News" Washington Bureau in the mid-1950's and was named Chiet of this Bureau

Honorable Marvin Watson

In July, 1958, a Government official who had frequent contact

with correspondents in Washington characterized Mr. Lisagor as a good

reporter but lacking in discretion because of his reputation for "taiking too

much, " especially at the National Press Club.

In this regard, the President advised me on June 4, 1965; of

his concern about leaks which had occurred in the Administration and referred

specifically to information leaked to the "Washington Post" by a State Department

official that the FBI was sending men to the Dominican Republic.

The President also mentioned that he was disturbed about an

article which had appeared in the June 3, 1965, issue of the "Chicago Daily

News" concerning Russian bombers reportedly being stationed in Hanoi. This

article, written by fir. Lisagor, contained intormation which was known only to the

Secretaries of State and Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staif,

A discreet inquiry into this matter disclosed that apparently

Mir. Lisagor obtained this information from the late Marguerite Higgins, a journalist

who was married to William E. Fall, a retired Lieutenant General of the Air Force.

General Hall has close contacts with members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and it

was presumed that he had obtained this information and furnished it to his wife.

She did not use the information herself, apparently to preciude attention being

atty News, but gave it instead to ur. Tisagor, who reposted it in the "catcao

The fingerprint files of the Identification Division of the FSI

contain no arrest data identifiable with Mr. Lisagor based upon background

information submitted in connection with this name check request.

Dear Vir. Watson:

on Mir. Ben w.

Cilbert, who is Deputy Managing Editor of 'The

Washington Post."

Mr. Gilbert has never been the subject of an FBI

inquiry; however, FBi files contain the following information

concerning him. Mr. Gilbert voluntarily appeared at FBI

Mr. Gilbert stated that he was born Ben Wertheimer

Goldberg, but in 1940 at Columbia, Missouri, he legally changed

his name to Ben William Cilbert.

However, previous to legally

changing his name and while a student at City College of New York,

he signed a Young Communist League (YCL) membership card as

Berf Gilbert and attended weekly meetings of the Far Rockaway

Branch of the YCL during the Fall and Winter of 1936-37. He

stated that the discussions at these meetings concerned public

= :

issues, pamphlets, and the Marxist approach to contemporary

events. He said that the program was primarily the "Popular

Front'' program of that day which appealed to him as it represented

a determined fight against the rise of Fascism. Mr. Gilbert said

that the crowd with which he grew up and attended school at City

College during the depression days from 1933 to 1937 was 85 per

0313

cent Jewish, living in constant fear of the NaziREd &i Germany-

and never expecting to graduate from college into a job.

Honorable Marvin Watson

recalled that aîter a few months, in the Winter of 1937, he began to

question the "Popula: Front'' program of the YCL and the high-

handed methods of those in charge of the organization. He, therefore,

severed his connections with the YCL.. He stated that aiter he made

this break he then confessed his former membership to his father,

who was strongly anticommunist, and that he has told at least two

dozen persons about his membership in the YCL. Mr. Gilbert stated

that he has never sought to conceal his membership, even though he

is ashamed oi it, realizing that it was a mistake on his part.

Mr. Gilbert advised that during this period at the

City College of New York he had no other organizational affiliation

other than in the American Student Union. It is noted that the

American Student Union has been cited as a communist front by

the Special Committee on Un-American Activities.

Mr. Gilbert recalled that while at the City College

of New York he had signed several petitions, but the only one he

could remember specifically was a petition in behalf of Morris

Schappes, the New York school teacher and Communist Party member

who was convicted of perjury in New York City.

Mr. Cilbert advised that since be left the City College

of New York in 1937, he has had no connection with any communist

organization and that he has, in fact, developed a record of anti-

comnunist activities. He specifically denied that he has ever been

at any time a member of the Communist Party. (100-350813-17)

Honorable Marvin Watson

In some of Kraft's columns, he has been critical of

the FBi and me. There was no basis in fact for the statements made

by Kraft with respect to this criticism and many of his staterents

were found to be erroneous. It was further determined that some of

Kraft's statements were based on false accusations originally made by

other long-time critics of the FBi. Krait was also author of the book,

"Profiles in Power," published in 1958 and last reprinted in 1966,

wherein he was again critical of my administration of the FBI, How-

ever, this criticism appeared to be a repetition of criticism made

about the FEi and me by other long-time critics of the FEI.

In connection with the aforementioned book, a listing

of Krait's other credits indicated that he was a special writer on the

campaign plane in 1960 for John I. Kennedy.

In March, 1905, a reliable source advised that Kraft

was in contact with the Algerian Ambassador to the United States,

During a discussion about Vietnam, Krait is alleged to have stated he

could not understand how President Johnson was ever converted to his

present policy in Vietnam, especially in view of the fact that Krait

considered President Johnson a "scared man" on things of that nature.@

FBI files contain no additional pertinent information

which pertains to Mr. Kraft.

The fingerprint files of the Identification Division of the

FBI contain no arrest data identifiable with Mr. Kraft based upon

background information submitted in connection with this name check

request.

A copy of this communication has not been sent to the

Acting Attorney General.

Sincerely yours,

NOTE: This communication is classified "Confidential" to preclude

disclosure of our interests in official representatives of a foreign

government. For the most part, Kraft's criticism of the FBI,C

mentioned above, deals with the type of criticism first voiced by such

individuals as Fred J. Cook and former Agents Turner and Lavine.

The criticism also related to the FBI's alleged shortcomings in the

Following are the details of my participation in the coverage of

the 1964 Democratic National Convention at Atlantic City, New Jersey.

1. Assistant Director Cartha D. De Loach

• 2. My instructions from Mr. Deloach were to insure complete

coverage of organizations of a militant nature which were present in

Atlantic City during the period of the Convention and to insure that advance

knowledge was obtained regarding any acts or intended acts of violence

which might be disruptive at the Convention.

3. In Atlantic City a special phone number was set up whereby

sources reporting on the various organizations could call to report informa-

tion they had received concerning intended demonstrations or other activities

of a violent nature. These various sources were to call and ask for "Elmer"'

when reporting their information.

4. All information received by me was taken in long-hand notes and

given to SAs Donald Hanning or Hobson Adcock who handled the paper work

required.

5. The information obtained was furnished as set out above;

however, it is my impression that memoranda or communications dictaied

by SA Hanning or Adcock were submitted daily to FBI Headquarters.

6. On the Friday before the week of the Convention I attended a

meeting in Mr. DeLoach's office attended by various individuals including

SAs Hanning, Adcock, Harold P. Linebaugh, Milton Jones and others at

which time it was specifically stated by Mr. DeLoach that the sole purpose

of the assignment was to be aware of and on top of any violent-type demonstra-

tions by various organizations gathering in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for dissemi-

7. I received no information indicating that the Bureau's services

were being utilized for political reasons. I do not recall receiving any such

information of this nature nor am I aware of anyone else in attendance

solicitating or obtaining any purely political type information. I do recall

that each evening Mr. De Loach talked by phone with Director Hoover and

was occasionally in telephonic contact with someone, whose identity I do

not recall, assigned to the White House delegation in Atlantic City. To

the best of my recollection the only information discussed by Mr. Deloach

was information received regarding demonstrations, etc.

8. It was perfectly clear in my mind ät that time and is still

perfectly clear that the only reason for my presence in Atlantic City was

for the purpose of handling and learning of those matters falling within

the Bureau's jurisdiction.

9. I do not recall any specific instructions being given regarding

confidentiality of my assignment.

10. This assignment has not been discussed by me with anyone

outside the Bureau. On Wednesday, 1/22/75, I received a telephone call

from an individual who identified himself as Ronald Kessler of the

Washington Post who stated that he understood that I was among a group

of Agents in Atlantic City with Mr. DeLoach in 1964 during the Democratic

National Convention. He further stated he understood that I was in charge

'of handling informants, including Julius Hobson. I referred Mr. Kessler

to the External Affairs Division and advised him that I was in no position

to comment on his inquiry.

11. I had no specific knowledge while in Atlantic City during the

period. ei

"of the Convention of any tesurs in operation.

12. I have read the article in the Washington Post today by Ronald

Kessler. While in Atlantic City all information received came through me

by a special telephone,

including intelligence information received by Agents

of the Newark Office and the Atlantic City Resident Agency. Messrs. De Loach,

Hanning, Adcock, Linebangh and I were situated in one room from 11:00 am

each morning until approximately 1:30 or 2:00 am that night. During that

time I do not recall hearing any discussions either in the room or on the

telephone by any of the individuals including Mr. De Loach which was of a

political nature.

In connection with questions set forth in teletype dated 1/26/75,

the following responses are set forth:

1. To the best of my recollection, I was instructed to report to

the Atlantic City, New Jersey, Resident Agency, by my squad supervisor,

Mr. William Holloway, or the Special Agent in Charge of the Newark

Division, Mr. Ralph W. Bachman.

"2. I was under the impression that I was being sent to the Atlantic

City Resident Agency to augment the U. S. Secret Service detail.

3. My assignment consisted of handling cases and leads that had

previously been assigned to Special Agents regularly detailed to the Atlantic

City Resident Agency.

4. As I recall, Mr. Cartha DeLoach, former Assistant Director,

was in the Resident Agency but my assignments regarding cases and the

handling of leads were obtained from one or more of the Special Agents

regularly assigned to the Atlantic City Resident Agency.

5. Information I received as the result of investigations conducted

was recorded in written form. This is because most of my work load

consisted of Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor Vehicle and Deserter

cases.

6. As I can recall, I was told by one of the Agents assigned to the

Resident Agency at Atlantic City that I would be handling some of the criminal

work normally assigned to regular employees of the Resident Agency in order

that they would be relieved for other duties.

The following are answers to questions concerning

my participation in the coverage afforded the 1964 Democratic

National Convention at Atlantic City, New Jersey, August 22 - 28,

1964.

(1) Instructions to participate in this assignment

were given by the C-4 Supervisor in the Newark Office,

believe that SA Vincent Murphy was the Supervisor at the

time.

(2) I was told to proceed to Atlantic City to

participate in a special.

I did not know the details of the

special but understood that it involved the protection of the

President of the United States during the Democratic

Convention.

(3) Upon arrival in Atlantic City I was assigned

to assist SA Billie D. Williams in the establishment of a

technical surveillance on a store-front where a group of

demonstrators gathered.

• (4) Chain of command consisted of Assistant

, Director. Deloach, who was assisted by SAs Hanning, Linbaugh,;

Adcock, and Elmer Todd.

I reported results of monitoring

to SA Elmer Todd by telephone. If he was

not present, I

reported to whoever covered his telephone.

(5) Results of information received were handled

orally over the telephone.

I would assume that the results

were reduced to writing at the command center.

(6) I was told that we were developing information

to protect the President from violent action by demonstrators.

I do not recall who told me but assume it was Mr. DeLoach

who held conferences outlining our investigation.

(7) No.

•(8) I do not recall the exact instructions given

or by whom, but it was my impression that we were conducting

our investigation to protect the President of the United States

from violence. The conferences I attended concerning these

matters were held by Mr. DeLoach.

(9) I was given the usual instructions to keep

my identity confidential.

(10) I do not recall discussing this assignment

with anyone outside the Bureau.

Mr. Ron Kessler, Washington

Post, called me on January 24, 1975, inquiring about this

matter.

I told him I would have to

call him back, and I

did not discuss it with him.

(11) I do not recall the name of the organization

involved at the store-front or if they had a name.

I know

of no other group that was covered.

I believe that

Martin Luther King was covered and know of no other individuals

who were covered.

(12) The monitoring of the group in the store-front

consisted mainly in overhearing remarks about planned

demonstrations in the vicinity of the Convention Hall

numbers of people involvea.

This was the type information

I passed on to SA Elmer Todd.

The surveillance was hindered

by the fact that the demonstrators were usually away from

the store-front.

: I recall that I assisted in delivering equipment to

SAs John Devlin and John Connelly at a large hotel in

Atlantic City. I believe that SA Leo Clark, was there and

• had arranged for some rooms for surveillance.

I believe

that they were surveying a room for coverage. I do not recall

if SA Billie D. Williams was present or not.

2. I was advised the Bureau had received information there woul

possibly be disruption to the point of violent tactics used by various activist

groups who planned to demonstrate at the 1964 Democratic Convention in

Atlantic City, New Jersey. Inasmuch as the physical safety of the President

and other officials at the Convention may be endangered, it was told to me

that I should be present at the Atlantic City Convention since I was familiar

with known activists from the Philadelphia and New York areas. I was

instructed to intermingle with demonstrators outside the Atlantic City Hall

where the convention was being held and be alert to any planned physical

acts to disrupt the normal convention program.

3. To be aware of any acts on the part of single individuals or

groups of individuals which may have been volatile or disruptive by way of

violence to the normal progràm for this convention.

4. I reported directly to former SA Hobson H. Adcock and SA

Elmer Todd.

5. Information developed relative to this assignment was furnished

orally.

6. Its purpose, as related to me, by former Assistant to the Director

Cartha D. DeLoach, was to be constantly intelligible as to any planned or

sporadic disruptive tactics by demonstrators at the Democratic Convention

which may endanger the physical safety of attendees at this convention. After

being in Atlantic City for approximately one day I was advised that the Bureau

had receive information two knknown Puerto Ricans were supposed to arrive

at the convention and make an attempt to take the life of President Johnson.

Supposedly they were to carry a sawed-off shotgun in a violin case and

and any information relative to their possible appearance in Atlantic City.

Mr. De Loach requested I advise him as to the best time for President

Johnson to arrive in Atlantic City by helicopter. Mr. DeLoach wanted my

recommendation as to the least vulnerable time for President Johnson's

helicopter to land, that is, when minimal demonstration activity would be

taking place.

7. No.

8. There was no doubt in my mind as to the instructions related to

me by Mr. DeLoach that my involvement in the Democratic Convention was

well within the Bureau's jurisdiction.

9. I was instructed that this particular assignment was to be

considered of a confidential nature and was to be discussed with only those

who had a need to know, or whom I was directed to divulge the nature and

results of this assignment.

10. No.

11. I personally was not aware that any individuals or organizations

were covered by technical surveillance.

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

ATE 1R24/ BIS STAMIAL

To:

Mr. Bassett

From

cRussell a. Horner

Reference is made to Bureau teletype 1/26/75, captioned

"Administrative Inquiry" dealing with the 1964 Democratic National

Convention at Atlantic City, New Jersey. My best recollection in con-

nection with my participation in FBI coverage of this convention is as

follows:

1. I participated in the "special" out of the Newark Office on

instructions of SAC Ralph W. Bachman, ASAC Karl L. Brouse, or Field

Supervisor Conrad W. Thompson, Jr.

2. My instructions at Newark were to proceed to Atlantic City

with à group of Agents also assigned to the same "special" and to receive

specific instructions from Senior Resident Agent Leo Clark relative to

the assignment. These assignments were given by Clark or in his absence

the Alternate Senior Resident Agent whose name I don't specifically recall

but who could have been Robert Tagg.

3. My assignment was more or less to participate in a loose

surveillance of the convention site to ascertain any "hot spots" that might

develop as a result of efforts of a dissident black political group from

Mississippi attempting to infiltrate the convention site and to disrupt the

convention or usurp the seating of the Mississippi delegation. As a result

of this assignment, surveillance teams were issued passes for the floor

of the convention and conducted a surveillance of the situation on the floor.

during the convention.

4.

A chain of command was developed by radio as we carried

portable radios on the floor and reported to a central dispatcher (name now

unrecalled but a Bureau Special Agent). It is understood that this infor-

mation was coordinated with other information received and furnished to

SA Clark.

This document is prepared in response to your venuest and is not for dissemi-

nation miside your Committee.

I's use is limitail to official proceedings by

your Commitee and the content may not be disclosed to unauthorized person

nel without the express approval of

the FBI.

HH 55085 DocId: 32989542 Page 52

---

## Page 53

5. No results of my efforts were reduced to writing and every-

thing was handled orally. To the best of my knowledge, no written

communications were prepared between Atlantic City and the Newark

Office on this "special.

6. My recollection at this time with regard to the purpose of

the assignment was to develop information that might lead to the preventing

of trouble or disorder at the convention, particularly as a result of black

dissidents attempting to force themselves on the convention.

7. There was no specific information ever received at any time

that indicated that the Bureau's services were being utilized for political

purposes.

8. No information can be recalled relating to instructions

received that would indicate that those issuing the instructions felt that

this surveillance fell within the Bureau's jurisdiction concerning inves-

tigations of terrorism, criminals, or other unlawful acts falling within

the Bureau's jurisdiction; however, in the same general time frame the

Bureau had been active in following civil rights demonstrations and to

my recollection I considered this an extension of that same effort.

9. It is my recollection that all members of the "special" received

instructions to the effect that the assignment should remain in the strictest

confidence, and also that every effort should be made in carrying out our

surveillance activity to remain anonymous.

10. I have never discussed this with anyone outside the Bureau.

No attempts have been made to interview me by any outside idividual

on this mater including former Bureau personnel.

11. At the time of the "special" I had no knowledge that electronic

surveillances were being used. Since that time, however, an approximate

11/2 years ago, as a result of my current assignment, handling electronic

surveillances at Headquarters, and in connection with some inquiry which

I cannot now recall, I became aware that two electronic surveillances were

utilized at Atlantic City during the 1964 convention. One of these was

Martin Luther King and the other a civil rights organization that I cannot

now recall.

12. It is my best recollection that during the surveillance on

the convention floor we worked closely with Secret Service details on the

floor and that group was aware of our presence in the convention.

The following concerns

the interview of former FBI

advised the legal counsel bivision of this sureau that it was

desired that Horner be made available for a Staft interview

concering his knowledge of COINTELPRO (Countorintelligence

Homer was subsequently released from his

confidentiality agreement with the FBI for the purpose of the

interview relating to the subject matter of COINTELPRO.

There follows a statenent which Horner voluntarily

furnished the FBI concerning the interview of him.

"On October 28, 1975, I was interviewed from

Re: Interview of Former FBI Special Agent (SA)

Russell H. Horner by SSC Staff Members

'The main thrust of the entire interview dealt with

or 1970, the exact date I could not recall. The entire inter-

view was devoted mainly to how the COINTELPRO operated with

little or no effort being made as to specific COINTELPRO efforts

being discussed.

Banoff was advised that we did not set policy

on the unit level, that all COINTELPRO proposals were approved,

to the best of my

recollection, in the Director's Office, but

could have been disapproved an the Assistant Director level.

Banoff had

a document written by former Supervisor Bernard A.

Wells, and

addressed to all offices, in July, 1968, which

set out il specific areas where counterintelligence action

might be taken under the COINTELPRO.

Miss Banoff went into

each item in an effort to determine how or why each item

appeared in the communication. It was mainly explained to her

that the letter was apparently written following a survey of

the field offices regarding counterintelligence activity that

had taken place.

endeavored to find out whether the

Inspection Staff had looked into the COINTELPRO both in the

field and at Headquarters.

She was advised that the Inspection

Division would normally look into this Program in both areas,

but as to the nature of their inquiry, I would be unable to

furnish any information and that Inspection policy was a matter

for the

Inspection Division to comment on. She inquired as to

how the COINIELIRO was taken from the unit and I explained that

after a period of time following its initial institution, the

Program was gradually deemphasized, became almost inactive in

the unit and was finally transferred back to the New Left Section.

I advised her that it did not appear that the Program had been

particularly effective in the New Left field. I advised that

COINTSIRO existed during an entire different atmosphere in

1968 - 19/0 than thet prevailing now and that it worl be almost

impossible to give such a Program fair judgment today.

RE: INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT IN

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On

Staff Member,

in his FBI office, Louisville, Kentucky, for approximately

thirty minutes.

Czarnecki was not advised of any constitutional

rights nor was he requested to sign any waiver of rights

form.

Mr. Smith stated that while he was in his

Washington, D. C. Office earlier this week, members of

the SSC staff, identities not mentioned, requested him to

contact Czarnecki in connection with Smith's impending

visit to his home in Louisville. Specifically, they re-

quested Smith to interview Czarnecki concerning a

" captioned "Investi-

Mr. Smith stated he did not have a copy of this memorandum

nor had he read it. He stated it dealt with requesting

•of Federal

Income Tax returns of certain Key Activists

from the U. S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Czarnecki

advised he could not recall this specific memorandum nor

its contents.

Czarnecki advised Mr. Smith that he doubts

that he had "signed out" a memorandum and then explained

all of his correspondence was approved or "signed out" by

a Unit Chief to which Czarnecki was assigned at any

given time. It was further explained that Czarnecki had

served in two sections, eight Units, and three Divisions

at fBI headquarters during the period september, 196%,

through April, 1972.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions

of the FBI.

U.

S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT IN

' CHARGE (SAC) STANLEY S. CZARNECKI

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Mr. Smith asked Czarnecki if he had ever requested

IRS to furnish the FBI any income tax returns on Key Activists

and what procedure was followed in requesting same.

Czarnecki

explained he could have, however, could not recall if he

personally had ever requested such tax returns; however, he

does recall such requests were made on a selective basis.

These requests were made only after careful review of the

request and approval obtained by officials within the

Domestic Intelligence Division.

Smith asked Czarnecki if he had ever seen any of

the tax returns and what type of security was afforded them.

Czarnecki advised he had seen some tax returns of Key

Activists and believes the number was small. These returns

as well as all documents located in the Domestic Intelligence

'Division were afforded top security and most all such material

was

reviewed on a need-to know basis.

Smith also asked whether the Bureau supervisor handling

Key Activists had direct live contact with Internal Revenue

Service Agents.

Czarnecki stated he recalls no direct contact

was ever had with IRS people by the regular Bureau supervisors.

Smith asked Czarnecki's opinion whether or not the

• Tax returns should be made available to all law

enforcement agencies to aid them in certain types of investi-

gations. Czarnecki advised he could not speak for all of

law enforcement, however, depending upon the type of investigative

matter any and all information that could be developed on a key

subject or suspect would be helpful.

Mr. Smith advised Czarnecki that he may be back in

touch with him in approximately three weeks and, if necessary,

will have a copy of the memorandum which Czarnecki allegedly

"signed out."

carefully evaluate the propriety of initiating or deferring investigation of

a disciplinary matter where such investigation might prejudice pending

investigations or prosecutions.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

In connection with the SSC's many varled and voluminous

requests for information relating to king, repeated reviews

the King and related case files and records have been made

by

FBI: Headquaxters (FBIHQ) personnel in order to be responsive

¡to such requests. Some of these requests have been so broad,

general and, in some instances, duplicative in nature, that

a serial-by-serial, page-by-page review of the King and related

files has been necessesy. Aecordingly, a total review of the

King and related case files and records in response to Item 2

has not been made in this instance.

A revlew of the King file

in response to othex items included in the October 15, 1975,

request end a polling of all Headquarters personnel Involved

¡In shat and previous revlews did not result in the location

or recollection of any information in FBIHQ files to indicate

any of the aforementioned individuals were specifically

avare of any efforts, steps or plons or proposals to "discredit"

or "neutsalize" King.

It 15, of course, evident that mich information de-

veloped in the course of the King case involving hin in

activitles. of interest to the White House and to representatives

of the Department of Justice,

including Attorneys General

Kennedy and Katzenbach, as well as Assistant Attorney General

Marshall, was such that it could conceivably have been the

opinion of one or more of the above Individuals that such

Infornation was

being provided to "discredie" or "neutralize"

King.

Regerding Item 3, a portion of the material being

delivered Involves cover comminications which transmitted to

the White House and Attorneys General memoranda containing

Information obtained from telephone and microphone surveillances

of Ring. While the White House and Attorneys General were

not specifically advised that the information provided was

primarily obtained from mierophone survelllance, the wording

of the memoranda furnished, including direct quotes, was.

couched in such a manner that it should have been obvious

microphone was the source.

(SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

With respect to Item 4, it is noted that in his

memorandun dated October 21, 1963, which is being delivered,

Evans indicated that the Attorney

General "asked that this

coverage and that on King's residence be evaluated at the end

of 30 days in light of the results secured so that the

continuance of these surveillances could be determined at that

time:"

There is no indication the Attorney General desired

to be advised of this evaluation.

In the

Bland to Sullivan

memorandum dated December 20, 1963, It 18 pointed out that

the installations on King and the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference (SCLC) were closely supervised and evaluated and

it wes recommended and subsequently approved by the FBl

Director that these installations, be continued for an

additional three months.

These surveillances continued with

periodic internal FBI justifications until 1965, with products

of the surveillances being regularly furnished the Department

of Justice and other interested Government agencies.

From

1965 to the discontinuance of these surveillances in 1966,

the Department of Justice was furnished six-month justificatfong

on this coverage.

Coples of these menorenda of justification

are being delivered in response to Iten 4, along with coples

returned by the Department bearing what appear to be the

Initials of Mr. Katzenbach in the upper right-hand corner.

Regarding Item 5 and the Bland to Sullivan memorandum

dated December 20, 1963, there appear to be two sets of initials

in the upper left-hand corner.

The top initiels appear to be

those of W. I, Forsyth, dictator of the memorandum. Lower

initials appear to be those of J. F. Bland.

Regarding Item 6, the routing slip from the Director

contains instructions that the Attorney General be given results

i of coverage as stated in the second paregraph of the Sullivan

memorandum to Belmont dated January 13, 1964.. This routing

slip denotes enclosures as the memorandum of January 13, 1964,

and a letter to the Attorney General, This letter is not

being delivered because its entire contents are the product of

electronic surveillance of King.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

In attempting to discover specific information

relating to "the nemorial" as requested' in Item 7 a, it was

determined that all Information in the files of FBIHQ relating

to "the memorial" was obtained by electronic surveillance of

King and 1s, therefore, not being delivered.

Wich respect to Items 7 b and e, the notations "Done'

in reconmendations 1 and 2 of the Baungardner to Sullivan

memorendum dated March 4, 1964, were made to indicate personal

delivety to the Honorable W. R. Jenkins, Special Assistant to

the President, and the Attorney Genexal, of memoranda dated

March 4, 1964, summarizing the Willerd Hotel Incident.

Delivery was apparently made

who at that time had Liaison

Functions treeh the hate wou evans,

and Department of Justice, respectively.

These memoranda to

the White House and Attorney General are not being delivered

because their entire contents were obtained through electronic

survelllance of King. No. other information could be located

In FBIHQ files bearing on the notacion "Done" In recommendations

1 and 2.

Regarding Item 8, personnel files at FBIHQ disclosed

a secord on only one Special Agent (SA) by the name of Joe Hoods:

This tecord indicates SA Joseph Ignatius Woods entered on duty

August 30, 1954, and resigned October 20, 1961. Woods was

subsequently elected Sheriff of Cook County, Illinois, and

in that capacity met with Directot Hoover on November 28, 1966.

•A memorandum from J. J. Casper: to MI. Mohz dated November 28,

1966, which reported results of this meeting, is being delivered.

The only reference to King during this discussion appeats on

page 5.

All ocher discussion points have been excised as

not

pertaining to the SSC inquiry regarding King.

Item ll requests all materials and information

explaining or pertaining to circumstances surrounding, of

facts bearing on, the absence, disappearence, of present

location of Deloach's November 21, 1964, memorandum which is

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Bureau Chief, 'Newsweek' Magazine, Washington, D. C" As

previously indicated to the SSC, an exhaustige review of

logical FBIHQ files, including abstracts of Deloach's

correspondence, failed to result in the location of a

November 21, 1964, memorandum concerning Mr. Bradlee and his

contact vith FBIHQ.

This Bureau is in possession of no information bearing

on the absence, disappearance of present location of such a

memorandum and-the fact that a reference to such a memorandum

in the December 1, 1964, memorandum was erroneous cannot be

discounted

With respect to Item 12, it is not fully clear to

this Bureau as to what is meant by the SSC's request for all

materials and other information pertaining to information

contained in the third paragraph of Mr. Deleach's memorandum

of December 1, 1964, captioned "Ben Bradlee, Bureau Chief

'Newsweek' Magazine, Washington, D C.," previously furnished

to the SSG. If this request pertains solely to the éxcised

material following the phraseology "that the FBI had told him

( Bradlee) that Martin Luther King was a

_'". 1t should be

noted that such information is the product of electronic

surveillance of king and is, therefore, not to be made available.

With respect to Item 13, no information could be

Located in FBIHQ files to explain what Mr. Deloach meant by the

"need" mentioned in his addendum dated December 10, 1964,

to the memorandum of Mr Sullivan dated December 2, 1964,

captioned "Summary, Highly Sensitive Coverage, Martin Luther

King, Jr." It should be noted that the only use of information

obtained from the transcripts of electronic surveillances of

King was to Incorporate such information-into communieations

for dissemination. Details of this dissemination have been

furnished the SSC in response to previous requests: Therefore,

In light of the use being made of the transcripts, it might be

presumed that what Deloach had in mind was needing the

transcripts to be able to prepare higher quality communications

for dissemination. This waild appear to be supported by

HH 55085

## Page 88

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

DeLoach's statement that there was no "need" for the

transcriptions "right now," implying there could be a need

at some future time.

With respect to the excisions in materials being

delivered herewith, where no notation appears as to reason

for excision, the excision was made for the reason that the

Information actually summarizes of quotes from conversations

monitored during electronic surveillances of King. In some

cases, it can be ascertained precisely what information 1n

FBI files came from electronic surveillances of King; however,

there exist: areas where documentation of the information

is not precise and no accurate determination can be made.

Therefore, no assurances can be given that portions of the

materlals being furnished do not contain information developed

as a résult of electronic surveillances of King.

Based on the foregoing,

Bland was subsequently further released from his employment

agreement for the anticipated

interview covering these additional

subject matters.

There follows a statement of Bland voluntarily

furnished to the FBI reporting the results of the interview of

him.

"Interview began approximately 2:00 p.m.

and lasted

until 4:00 p.m., October 13, 1975.

Interview conducted by

John Elliff - head of the Domestic Intelligence Task force

and Martha Ialley - attorney on the Research Staff.

1 was

asked to sign and did sign a waiver of rights.

Asked me my

Bureau background, times of assignments and positions.

"Interview concerned Security Indices - primarily the

history of Security Index and related matters - Gommunist

Index - Reserve Index - Sections A and B - Detcom and Comsab

tabbing etc.

"General information of the mechanics of operation of

the Index was furnished within my knowledge:

That based on

substantive subversive information an investigation was conducted

evaluated on a number of levels both in the field and at

headquarters and periodically evaluated thereafter; the Depart-

ment of Justice knowledge - approval and review; the fact

that the Index was an administrative device to erticientl

handle matters relating to persons who could be potentiall

dangerous to the security interests of the J. S, in the event

of an emergency.

"In addition it was clearly pointed out that the

selves - contained no opinion or suppositions and that the fact

a person was included on the Index was for administrative

uses within the Bureau and the Department of Justice.

"A Committee representative, Martha Talley, had

concerning the investigation of Martin Luther

advised that she had spoken to another representative of the

Re:

Interview of Former FBI Section Chief

Axthur J. Baker by an SSC Staff Member

"For information there is set forth below my

recollections of a stati interview with the Senate Select

Comnittee on Intelligence.

"I reported to the Senate Office Building at 9:30 a.I.

on October 9, 1975 and was interviewed by Mary Deûreo.

interview was concluded about 10:40 a.M.

"Her questions were mostly general In nature about my

work in the Laboratory Her particular interest seened to center

around

the Martin Luther King, Jr., case with special attention

on the technical surveillances used. Apparently the reason I

was called was that my name appeared on several memoranda

covering technical discussions between Domestic Intelligence

Division and Laboratory personnel indicating that the memoranda

had been routed through me.

"Her main concern seemed to be if I had any knowledge

concerning transcriptions or composites of any technical

surveillance tapes being made in the Laboratory. I had no

recollection of any such tapes being made and so informed her."

on, October 14, 1975, Baker voluntarily furnished the

following additional information which, in more detail, reports

on the interview of him.

The interview was not under oath and no statement was

made to Baker concerning his rights.

At the request of the interviewer, Baker furnished

general background intormation concerning himself in respect

to his FBi career.

ptoblems in the organized crime field. As Executive Assistant to the

• Commissioler, Bureau of Narcotics, Caitney attended a conference of

high-level Government officials with Attorney General Robert Kennedy at

the United States Court House, Foley Square, New York City, on March 20,

•1963. Gaffney has also been a member of the Committee on Organized

Crime, International Association of Chiefs oi Police. He participated in

the preparation of a reportby that Committee which was printed li

October, 1964. Gafiney's contribution was a creditable account of La

Cosa Nostra's participation in narcotics traffic.

..

In connection with the recent disclosuse in the newspaper

dealing with the Bureau of Narcoties' involvement in the monitoring

incident regarding Wayne G. Bromley on warch 26, 1965, it is under-

stood that Gaifney is greatly chagrined at his Bureau's involvement in

the incident.

He expiained that is the Bureau of Narcotics had any

knowledge that the f'BI had originally turned down the Justice Departinent's

request for its assistance in the monitoring incident on March 26, 1u65,

the Bureau of Narcotics would have had nothing to do with the affair.

Fie

linplied that the Bureau of Narcotics was "sucked in" by the Justice

Department in complying with their request which at the time appeared

reasonable and legal, and their acquiescence to the request was based strictly

on their desire to cooperate with another agency.

One of Mr. Miller's law partners is Courtney 4. Evans,

a former Assistant Diractor of the FEI.

Ax. Evans entered the FBI

in December, 1940, and retired in December, 1964, Froin 1061 through

1954, he handled liaison with the office of the Attorney General and had

numerous oiticial and social contacts with Robert E. Kennedy. Mi. Evans'

close relationship with Robert Kennedy continued following his retirement

from the FBI.

During Robert Kennedy's tenure as Attorney General,

• Nir. Evans had a number of discussions with him concerning the use of

microphones by the FBI; and fir. Evans personally prepared oiticial

memoranda for FBI files reflecting not only Robert Kennedy's knowledge,

but his enthusiastic approval, of the FEI's use of microphone surveil-

lances in criminal-type, as well as security-type, investigations. In a

meeting with two F'BI oificials at the Bureau's headquarters on

December 24, 1065, Mir. Evans discussed contacts he had had with,

and information which had been furnished to, Robert Kennedy and other

Justice Departmental officials who had served under Robert Kennedy

concerning the use of the microphone surveillances by the FLI. Nonctheless

soon afterthis meeting, ifr. livans furnished Hobert isennedy a letter

denying that he had talked with hir, or had given written material to

Robert Kennedy, about the I'BI's use of microphones.

On December 10, 1966, in connection with the public

denials that Robert iennedy knew about the IBI's use of microphones

while he was Attorney General, Robert Kennedy released to the press

the letter which itr. Evans had written him. The letter was dated

February 17, 1965. In it, lin. Ivans falsely stated that he "did not

discuss the use of"' microphones by the fEI with Robert Kennedy

auring his tenure as Attorney General--and further that Mr. Evans

did not know of any written material that was sent to Robert Kennedy

"at any time concerning" FBI microphone surveillances.

On December 11, 1969, the FBI released to the press

two memoranda which had personally been prepared by Mr. Ivans in

the Summer of 1961 relating to discussions he had had with the then

Attorney General Kennedy concerning use of microphone surveillances

by the fBI. Reportedly, the release of these memcranda (which prove

the statements in the letter released to the press by Robert Kennedy

on December 10, 1965, to be false) caused a rift between these two men:

and Robert Kennedy, it is said, no longer speaks to Mr. Evans.

Another document which was widely publicized in

December, 1960, in connaction with Robert Kennedy's denial that he

knew of the FEI's use of microphones was a letter which the then

Assistant Attorney General Herbert Miller wrote to Senator Sam J. •

Ervin, Jt., on May 25, 1061. In this letter, Mr. Miller indicated

knowledge of the aBI's usa of 78 wiretaps and S7 other electronic listening

devices.

The December 11, 1936, issue of "The Evening Star"

of Washington, D. C., contained an article. citing the letter which

Herbert Miller had written to Senator Urvin on May 25, 1951. The

December 11, 1906, newspaner article stated that "Iiller himself

pointed out that the letter did not inention illegal eavesdrops--the kind

involving physical trespass on private proporty." It then quoted Miller

as commenting, "I sincerely doubt that anybody in the Department knew

that there was any trespass in placing of these devices. I did not iow

and I wager that the Attorney General did not know there was trespass."

(Regarding Herbert Miller's above-cited statement of

denial, it should be noted that an official memorandum was sent to the

- 2 =

55085 DocId: 32989542

Page 136

---

## Page 137

then Deputy Attorney General, Byron R. White, by the FBI on

May 4, 1961--three weeks before Mr. Miller wrote his letter to

Senator Ervin.

• The memorandum had been prepared in connection

with the contemplated appearance of Attorney General Kennedy before

a committee of the United states senate. It dealt with the authority

, underlying the FBI's use of microphone surveillances and said, "... in

the internal security field, we are utilizing microphone surveillances

on a restricted basis even though trespass is necessary to assist in

uncovering the activities of soviet intelligence agents and Communist

Party leaders. In the interests of national safety, microphone surveil-

lances are also utilized on a restricted basis, even though trespass

is necessary, in uncovering major criminal activities." Thus, there

is no question that the Justice Department was notified of the FEI's use

of microphones involving trespass early in Robert isennedy's

administration as Attorney General.)

In February, 1951, at the request of the then Deputy

Attorney General, Byron R. White, the FBI conducted an investigation

• 'Of Herbert viller in connection with the position of Assistant Attorney

General in charge of the Criminal Division. The investigation was

favorable. It did reflect one traific citation for passing a red light

in Maryiand in October, 1960, which resulted in Vir. Miller's paying

a fine:

Vi: Miller's nomination as Assistant Attorney General

was confirmed by the Senate on March 2, 1961. In commenting upon

Mr. Miller's nomination, the'Chicago Jun-Times" editorialized on

February 25, 1961,". it may seem strange that the Kennedy adminis

tration, which has been enthusiastically putting worthy Democrats to

wor's since January 20, would tap a member of the GOP for the post....

We suspect that, among others, Teamster Czar Jimmy Hota will get the

message. Since July, 1959, Maller has been chief counsel for the board

of monitors which was created by the U. 3. District Court to keep Boffa's

operation of the International Brothernood of Teamsters under surveil-

lance." (A profile-type feature article concerning Herbert Miller in the

December 13, 1906, issue of "The New York Times" credited him with

having "directed the ficia case through four indiciments, three trials and

four appeals" in his role as Assistant Attorney General.

It stated that

Mr. Miller "caught Mr. Kennedy's attention" when "Mir. Kennedy was

counsel for the senate committee investigating the teamsters (and)

Mr. Miller was the lawyer for the court-appointed board of monitors

supervising the union's atfairs." This article also commented upon the

fact that Mir. Miller was a Republican at the time of his appointment in

1961.)

Ci May 11, 1961, Assistant Attorney General Miller

testified before the Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights of the jenate

Judiciary Committee and expressed himsel as favoring the passage of

legislation to authorize limited and controlled interception and disclosure

'of telephone conversations. :

By memorandum dated March 25, 1065, Herbert Miller

requested the I El to monitor and tape-record a proposed meeting of

Robert Baiser, Wayne Bromley (former associate of and Government

witness against Robert Baker) and Clitford Jones (former Ileutenant

Governor of Nevada) to be held in Los Angeles on the evening oi

March 20; 1965. Meruert Miller's memorandum requested that this

be accomplished by attaching a transmitting device to the person oi

Bromley. The EBl refused to honor this request.

• In December, 1964, Herbert Miller was said by the

Department of Justice to ba a candidate for appointment as Juage oi

the United States Circuit Court for the District of Columbia Circuit.

In April, 1005, he ceased duty as Assistant Attorney General.

On July 12, 1065, Nicholas Katzenbach, who then was

Attorney General, advised the FBI that he (iatzenbach) had suggested

to the President that ilerbert Miller be designated to serve as Chairman

of the President's Commission on Crime in the District of Columbia.

Nicholas Katzenbach stated that the President reacted favorably to his

suggestion. On July 16, 1965, Herbert Miller's appointment to serve

INTERVIEW OF RAYMON

SMITH

On 10/23/75, I was interviewed by two members of the Senate

Select Committee, Mrs. Mary DeOreo and Mr. Mark Gitenstein, at the Dirkse

Building in the office of the Senate Select Committee. The interview began at

10:30 a.m. and ended at Noon. I was not advised of anything pertaining to my

rights.

The following are questions asked and the answers I gave, to the

best of my recollection:

QUESTION: When you went to the platform that morning - was it the day after

Mr. Hoover died, or two days later?

ANSWER: I can't remember.

QUESTION: On that particular morning in question, what did you do?

ANSWER: I went out to the platform and I found the truck sitting funny and I

wasn't sure if I had a flat tire or what. I checked the rear tires, but

found the tires were up so that I figured something was on the truck.

I can't remember if the truck was locked or what, but when I opened the

truck it was loaded with cabinets from front to back. I questioned my

supervisor, Tony Codi, about the cabinets on the truck. To his knowledge

he didn't know where they came from. He went around to the front office

to check and was told that the cabinets were to go to Mr. Hoover's house.

QUESTION: Who gave Codi the message to take the cabinets out to Mr. Hoover's

house?

ANSWER: It could have been Mr. Marsden or Mr. Gregory. I don't know which.

Tony double checked to find out who was going out to Mr. Hoover's house

after I questioned him if the moving crew was going. I was told there would

be no one going, but there would be a car following the truck.

QUESTION: Did you recognize the car or did you see it?

ANSWER: I couldn't tell the car from any other car out there in the street.

QUESTION: Did the car beat you to the house?

ANSWER: I didn't know if the car beat me there or not because there were other

cars parked there.

QUESTION: Where were the cabinets unloaded? ALL INFORMATICN CONTAINED

QUESTION: Who helped you to unload?

ANSWER: I didn't know the people.

QUESTION: Was anyone there that you recognized?

ANSWER: Yes. Miss Gandy.

QUESTION: Did you know Mr. Mohr, the SAC from Washington Field Office or

Mr. Dunphy and were they there?

ANSWER: I wasn't sure of that day - I wasn't sure of Mohr or Dunphy.. I didn't

know the SAC from Washington Field Office.

QUESTION: Did you know anyone in Washington Field Office.

ANSWER: No.

QUESTION: Did the people who helped you move the cabinets - did you recognize

any of them - were they Agents or what?

ANSWER: I didn't know.

QUESTION: Were they dressed in suits?

ANSWER: No.

QUESTION: Were the file cabinets full or what did they contain?

ANSWER: I didn't know. All I knew was that they were heavy, that they contained

some type of file because while I was unloading one of the cabinets a drawer

fell open and I almost fell off the truck. They were manila type, light in

color.

QUESTION: Were they regular movers or what that helped you move the cabinets?

ANSWER: No, because they were inexperienced in moving cabinets because I had

to show them everything.

QUESTION: Was this an unusual procedure?

ANSWER: Yes, but I didn't ask any questions.

QUESTION: Did the Bureau have their own crew?

ANSWER: Yes, or they generally had GSA come in, according to how big a

move they had.

QUESTION: Were they all white or what?

ANSWER: I didn't see any Blacks - everyone was white.

QUESTION: What was the number of cabinets?

ANSWER: I don't know - I just can remember how the cabinets were arranged

in there (the basement).

QUESTION: Were there other boxes and things there ?

ANSWER: Yes.

QUESTION: The second move - was it the day after the first move?

ANSWER: Yes, I think it was.

QUESTION: How many cabinets?

ANSWER: Not as many as the first.

QUESTION: Did you have help in moving the cabinets - were they the same people?

ANSWER: I did have help, but I couldn't say if they were the same people.

QUESTION: After unloading the cabinets, what did you do?

ANSWER: I reported back to the Justice Building.

QUESTION: How long did it take you to unload the cabinets?

ANSWER: Maybe an hour or two, I can't remember exactly.

ANSWER: Yes, Jesse Peterson and I took some cabinets or small safe files out.

ANSWER: Yes.

QUESTION: Do you know her well?

ANSWER: I know her well enough as a friend.

QUESTION: Was Annie's room in the basement?

ANSWER: Yes.

QUESTION: Would she have seen the cabinets?

ANSWER: I would think so.

QUESTION: (This would go back to the series of questions on the movers.)

Could anyone else drive the truck?

ANSWER: Yes.

QUESTION: Who could drive it?

ANSWER: Agents or anyone because the truck had been used for special

assignments and it was no big thing for someone else to drive it.

QUESTION: Did you keep official records on the trips that you made with the truck?

ANSWER: Mileage was kept, the truck was signed out every morning and in at

night, but there were no other records kept.

QUESTION: The day after Mr. Hoover died, Exhibits went up to move things out

of his office - if the cabinets were up there, wouldn't Mr. Dunphy: " have

seen them?

ANSWER: I don't know if the cabinets were up there or not - I couldn't answer

that question.

QUESTION: How did you get along with Mr. Hoover?

ANSWER: O.K. I had a job to do.

QUESTION: How did you get along with Mr. Tolson?

ANSWER: 0.K.

QUESTION: On that morning of Mr. Hoover's death, where were you and

what did you know?

ANSWER: On that morning I had to pick up Mr. Tolson and I was told to go to

Mr. Hoover's house and to wait until further orders. I waited until

Mr. Mouten (ph.), Mr. Hoover's chauffeur, came out and told me to

report back to the building. I questioned him as to what was going on,

but he didn't tell me, he just said to report back to the building.

QUESTION: Did you know if Mr. Tolson knew he was dead or what?

ANSWER: I didn't know myself because I didn't find out he was dead until I

got to the building.

QUESTION: Had you made any previous trips out to Mr. Hoover's house after

his death?

ANSWER: Yes.

I took some plants from the Botanical Garden to his house.

QUESTION: After Mr. Tolson's death, did you go out to the house to move any

cabinets or anything?

ANSWER: No.

QUESTION: Why were you sent to Quantico?

ANSWER: The mechanic job came open - it was something I had worked at

part-time and when the job came open I applied for it and I was transferred

down there.

QUESTION: Were you drilled on anything?

ANSWER: No.

QUESTION: Have you talked to anyone concerning the cabinets?

ANSWER: Yes. I talked to Jesse Peterson because I was trying to make him

remember moving cabinets when we had to set the safe files on the platform.

QUESTION: Why did they use you to drive? Did they trust you?

ANSWER: I don't know. I was just told to take them out there.

QUESTION: Were the cabinets moved out of Mr. Hoover's house at night?

ANSWER: I don't know whether they moved them in the day or night or what.

QUESTION: Do you think GSA could have moved the cabinets from his house

that night?

ANSWER: I don't think so.

QUESTION: How did you know something was on the truck?

ANSWER: Just like you would come out the next morning and see something

was wrong - I drove the truck each and every day and that's why I knew

something was wrong.

QUESTION: How did you get along with Miss Gandy?

ANSWER: O.K. The only trouble I had was one time when I was told to report

to her office to make a run out to the house to pick up some mail and I was

told I had to take some other things out there and as we were walking along

she kept asking the same question over and over again - did I mind going

out to the house, and I told her no. When we got to the outer office there

were about 15 to 20 cases of soda. I was told to get a handcart to load the

sodas and to get a car. I told her if I had known that I had to take the sodas

out I would have brought a small truck around. She told me, "In other words,

you don't want to go out to the house." I told her I did not say that. I was

told "You can report back downstairs" and I told her that was perfectly all

right with me. I reported the incident to my supervisor, Mr. Gregory.

QUESTION: Did you see Miss Gandy anymore after that?

ANSWER: Yes, I had to take her to the doctor and the next time was out at

Mr. Hoover's house.

Dear MI. Levi:

75

At the close of his testimony on September 25,

Mr. Charles Brennan, former Chief of Domestic Intelligence

Division, indicated that he could not answer a question

posed to

him by me.

The question relates to the status of

a so-called "closed" FBI Domestic Intelligence case file.

Suppose that the individual who is subject of the file is

member of the military service or applies for employment

with a federal government agency, and the agency requests an

FBI name check.

What information would be provided to the

federal agency by the FBI as the result of that name check?

What information would be provided to that agency if the FBI

conducted a background investigation on that individual?

respect to surreptitious entries for the pur-

pose of installing electronic surveillance equipment, which

are referred to on page three of the September 24, 1975 letter

from Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., to myself, I would appreciate

answers to the lot one edite nur ae in as soloX

each year

SINCe 1960?

What has been the number of separate targets s

for each year since 1960?

3.

What has been the total number of separate

targets since 1960?

I would also request access, under agreed upon pro

cedures, to a list of such targets, and, the dates of the

sincerely,

ies.

No, why should I, as I said, before,

I wasn't in the Director's office.

Mr. Battle, Mr. Shaffer states you and

he removed boxes from the Director's

Well, Mr. Shaffer is wrong. I never went

to the Director's office with he or anyone

else.

Have you discussed this matter with

anyone else?

Yes, with the FBI Inspectors who called

me in.

That was when?

In June, you can get the exact date

How about prior to that?

When he left for St. Louis:

You haven't discussed this matter with

anyone?

No, other than the above.

How come Kunkel was transferred to St.

Louis, there was a lot of publicity

about it?

I don't know anything more about it than

as you say the national publicity.

Wasn't there a personal feud between

Gray and Kunkel?

If there was, I don't have any direct

knowledge of it.

On September 19, 1975, at the request of the Legal

Council Division, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) -

Headquarters (HQ), Kenneth Shaffer, Chief Clerk, Washington

Field Office, appeared at the Senate Office Building for

the purpose of being interviewed by the Staff Members of the

United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

Activities.

The interview was conducted by Senate Select Staff

Members, Mary DeOreo and Mark Gitenstien. At the on-set of

the interview, Mr. Shaffer was not advised of his Constitu-

tional rights

nor was he advised that he was being questioned

on a voluntary basis.

During the month of June, 1975, Mr. Shaffer was

interviewed at FBI-HQ, relative to his participation in

the handling and destruction of material from the residence

and Justice Building Office of the late J. Edgar Hoover.

As a result of this interview an FD-302 (Report of Interview

Form) was prepared. Prior to the time of the interview by

the Staff Members, Mr. Shaffer had not had the opportunity

to read this report.

Mr. Shaffer requested that he be

permitted to read the FD-302 report.

After a short conference,

between the Staff Members, they agreed that it would be

permissible for him to read the report.

The interview by the Staff Members lasted approximately

one hour and 15 minutes.

RE: INTERVIEW OF CHIEF CLERK KENNETH SHAFFER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

Question: Did you see Mr. Kunkel in an automobile with Mr.

Battle on occasions when cartons were delivered

from Mr. Hoover's residence to the loading platform?

Answer: I do not recall seeing him.

Question: Tell us how you were advised that material was

ready to be picked up?

Answer:

Mr. Kunkel would receive a telephone call and in

turn would contact Mr. Battle and advise him.

Enroute from Mr. Hoover's residence, Mr. Battle

would contact the Radio Room and request that I

meet him at the platform.

Question: Were these cartons ever placed in the office of

Mr. Kunkel?

Answer:

No.

(For the record, I did retract this answer and

stated "that the beginning of the project, they

were placed in a room within his office and kept

there until it was time for destruction. After

a time, they were taken directly to the disintegrator

room. Mr. Dudney and I had the key to this room.")

Question: Is there another storage room in the Washington

Field Office where the cartons might have been

stored until time for destruction?

Answer:

No.

(Following the interview, in talking to Mc. Dudney,

I then realized that the interviewers were referring

to a walk-in vault where Mr. Dudney had placed

material on one or two occasions.)

RE: INTERVIEW OF CHIEF CLERK KENNETH SHAFFER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

Answer: No

Question: Was there any destruction of material after the

first week of July?

Answer:

No.

Question: Knowing that the Bureau lad its own disintegrating

facilities, why do you think Mr. Kunkel was requested

to handle the destruction of the material?

Answer:

Prior to Mr. Kunkel's becoming a Special Agent, he

was a Clerical Employee assigned to the Director's

office. Miss Gandy may have requested his assistance

in the destruction of Mr. Hoover's personal papers.

Question: Why do you think that such precautions were taken

in the handling and destruction of this material?

Answer:

The material was that of a prominent decéased

individual and the contents need not be publicized.

Question: Are you assigned to operate the disintegrator

machine?

Answer:

No, we have employees assigned this duty.

Question: Why did Mr. Kunkel ask you and Mr. Dudney to

personally handle the destruction of the late

Director's material?

Answer:

As Special Agent in Charge, Mr. Kunkel requested

Mr. Dudney and I to handle and destroy all material.

We did so without question.

made by Staff embers regarding Constitutional fights and

no mention was made as to whether or not this interview was

voluntary.

SA Dowling was asked if he had ever assisted in

the removal of certain boxes from the residence of the late

He replied that within one or two weeks

after Mr. Hoover's death, he accompanied Robert G. Kunkte,

who at that time was Special Agent in Charge of the Washington

field Office of the FBI, to Mr. Hoover's residence and assisted

in removing six to eight cardboard boxes. These boxes

were taken from the basement of the residence and delivered

the rear of the Old Post Office Building, 12th and Pennsylvania

Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. The boxes were placed on the

loading dock in the custody of either Kenneth Shaffer or

Thomas Dudney, FBI employees.

Concerning the boxes transported from Mr. Hoover's

residence to the 0ld Post Office Building, Special Agent

Dowling advised the SSC Staff Members that these boxes were

sealed with tape and that at no time did SA Dowling see what

was in the boxes. In addition, SA Dowling did not discuss the

Mr. Pottinger said that he responded by calling the Attorney: General and

telling him that the Civil Rights Division had already been considering

that matter for sometime, but that the inquiry to date; had "borne no

fruit whatsoever." Mr. Pottinger said that he was calling me inorder

to advise the Bureau that he would be undertaking a review as requested

by the Attorney General and to request our cooperation. I assured

Mr. Pottinger that I and others in the Bureau would be willing to

cooperate fully with him in that regard.

RE: VIETNAM VETERANS AGAINST THE WAR/WINTER SOLDIER

ORGANIZATION (VVAW/#SO)

1 - Mr. H, P, Beolwith

1 - Mr. R.L Shackelford

In June, 1967, Gus Hall, General Secretary of

the Communist Party,

USA (CPUSA) commented on the forth-

coming 1968 national elections. Hall stated that the CPUSA

must develop guidelines for the political campaigns and must

assist in the development of any 1968 campaign which was

antiwar in character and not limited to either major

political party. On September 10, 1967, the CPUSA publication,

"The Worker,

announced that the organization VVAW had been

forned in June, 196%, as a nonmembership organization made

up of Vietnam veterans who were opposed to the war.

This

communist publication provided

the purpose of VAN

as

opposition to the "unjustified" war in Vietnam.

It announced

that VVAW had joined

"the dissent of millions of Americans

against the war.

An initial limited inquiry was begun by the

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in September,

1967,

to determine, through inquiries with established sources

and public source material, if the CPUSA was directing or

controlling the newly formed VVAY. This limited inquiry

failed to establish that the CPUSA, or any other subversive

organization, exercised direction or control over VVAW. The

limited inquiry did indicate that VVAW leadership appeared

before the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) sponsored Militant

Labor Forum in New York City, but there was no indication of

any control by the SWP. Hith the absence of such direction

ox control by any subversive organization,

the limited

inquiry of VVAW was closed in October, 1967. A similar

limited inquiry was conducted in 1968, resulting in an

updated affirmation that VVAW was not controlled or dominated

by any subversive group. This second limited inquiry was

closed

in May, 1968.

During the limited inquiries in

1967 and 1968,

the National Headquarters of VVAW was

located in New York City.

VAN activities were primarily

devoted to participation in and

organization of

demonstrations opposing the war in Vietnam. No full

investigation was conducted by the FBI of VVAW until

August,

1971, when information from a variety of sources

dictated the

need to determine the extent of control

At 11:05 a.m., on November 21, Harry Morgan, former SAC,

telephonically advised me that he had just received a telephone call

from Gary Grace, a reporter for the Cincinnati, Ohio "Post", whose

telephone number is 513-721-1111. Grace requested a comment from

Morgan concerning testimony by Mr. Adams on November 19 before

captioned Committee in which it was mentioned that Mr. Morgan was

the author of a memorandum June 3, 1968, which described a

COINTELPRO operation against Antioch College. Mr. Morgan asked

me for advice as to what his response to the press should be. I reminded

him that he was still bound by an employment agreement requiring his

secrecy and I suggested to him that it would be appropriate for him to

refer the press inquiry to FBI Headquarters for comment here. Mr. Morgan

said he understood and accepted both of these suggestions, however, he

would like to respond to the press inquiry with the limited statement that

he was aware of the testimony by Mr. Adams and if Mr. Adams said that

he (Morgan) was the author of such memorandum that he considered it to be

true. I told Mr. Morgan that I saw no difficulty in his furnishing such an

observation. He thanked me and terminated the call.

I advised Mr. Coll, Press Service Office, of conversation with

Mr. Morgan and alerted him to the fact that his office may receive a call

from Gary Grace.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT IN

CHARGE (SAC) STANLEY S. CZARNECKI

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On friday, september 26, 1975, Mr. John. Smith,

Staff Member, SSC, interviewed SAC Stanley S. Czarnecki

in his FBI office, Louisville, Kentucky, for approximately

thirty minutes.

Czarnecki was not advised of any constitutional

rights nor was he requested to sign any waiver of rights

form.

Mr. Smith stated that while he was in his

Washington, D. C., office earlier this week, members of

the SSC staff, identities not mentioned, requested him to

contact Czarnecki in connection with Smith's impending

visit to his home in Louisville. Specifically, they re-

quested Smith to interview Czarnecki concerning a

memorandum Czarnecki had "signed out

on on key Ativist -"he left, data way 24, rest!

Mr. Smith stated he did not have a copy of this memorandum

nor had he read it. He stated it dealt with requesting

of Federal Income Tax returns of certain Key Activists

from the U. S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Czarnecki

advised he could not recall this specific memorandum nor

its contents.

Czarnecki advised Mr. Smith that he doubts

that he had "signed out" a memorandum and then explained

all of his correspondence was approved or "signed out" by

a Unit Chief to whom'. Czarnecki was assigned at any

given time. It was further explained that Czarnecki had

served in two Sections, eight Units, and three Divisions

at FBI headquarters during the period September, 1967,

through April, 1972.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions

of the FBI.

, U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FBI SPECIAL AGENT IN

CHARGE (SAC) STANLEY S. CZARNECKI

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Mr. Smith asked Czarnecki if he had ever requested

IRS to furnish the FBI any income tax returns on Keý Activists

and what procedure was followed in requesting same.

Czarnecki

explained he could have; however, could not recall if he

personally had ever requested such tax returns; however, he

does recall such requests were made on a selective basis.

These requests were made only after careful review of the

request and approval obtained by officials within the

Domestic Intelligence Division.

Smith asked Czarnecki if he had ever seen any of

the tax returns and what type of security was afforded them.

Czarnecki advised he had seen some tax returns of Key

Activists and believes the number was small. These returns

as well as all documents located in the Domestic Intelligence

Division were afforded top security and most all such material

was reviewed on a need-to-know basis.

Smith also asked whether the Bureau supervisor handling

Key Activists had direct live contact with Internal Revenue

Service Agents.

Czarnecki stated he recalls no direct contact

was ever had with IRS

people by the regular Bureau supervisors.

Smith asked Czarnecki's opinion whether or not the

Federal Income Tax returns should be made available to all law

enforcement agencies to aid them in certain types of investi-

gations. Czarnecki advised he could not speak for all of

law enforcement, however, depending upon the type of investigative

matter any and all information that could be

developed on a key

subject or suspect would be helpful.

Mr. Smith advised Czarnecki that he may be back in

touch with him in approximately three weeks and, if necessary,

will have a copy of the memorandum which Czarnecki

allegedly

"signed out."

RE: GARY THOMAS ROWE

At 11:00 a.M., November 21, 1975, Special Agent

NEIL P. SHANAHAN of the Philadelphia

Division of the FBI

was interviewed under oath by two staff members of the

above styled committee in the Old Senate Office Building

in Washington, D.C. Present during the interview and

doing most of

the questioning was Mr. ROBERT KELLY, and

MX. JOHN BAILEY, who identified themselves as staff

members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) •

Prior to any questioning, it was explained by

MI. ROBERT KELLY that SA SHANAHAN would be testifying

voluntarily and that he had a right to be represented by

counsel if he so desired,

Also prior to any questioning:

Mr. KELLY explained that

he had previously interviewed

GARY THOMAS ROWE, a former confidential informant for the

FBI and would be asking questions prompted by information

furnished to him by Mr. ROWE.

After responding to questions of a general

informative nature, such as when SA SHANAHAN handled

MI. ROWE, and the general dates of Mr. SHANAHAN'S

employment and assignments with the fBl, certain specific

areas were covered and recalled by SA SHANAHAN as follows:

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions

of the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to

UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT

COMMITTEE TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAI

OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

A question was asked concerning activities

taken by SA SHANAHAN upon receipt of information from

Mr. ROWE that the Ku Klux Klan was going to immediately

engage in some form of violent activity.

SA SHANAHAN

responded that upon receipt of such information, it was

immediately reported

to his superiors, and evaluated to

determine what immediate action, such

as dissemination

to local authorities, etc., was required. A question

was asked in this area directly on the issue of whether

anyone in the FBI instructed MI. ROWE to engage in any

violent activities. MI. SHANAHAN responded that at no

time did he, or anyone else to his knowledge, instruct

Mr. ROWE to angage in any violent activity.

In fact,

he was often instructed to avoid engaging in violent

activity,

At one point in the interview, Mr. JOHN BAILEY

asked questions concerning whether SA SHANAHAN could

express his opinion as to the morality or ethics involved

in certain activities which Mr. ROWE had reported that he

had engaged in.

This question was re-phrased several times

bY Mr. BAILEY beGause Of SA SHANAFIAN's repeated statements

that he did not understand the extent of the information

sought by MI. BAILEY.

Another critical aread questioning dealt with

a statement made by Mr. ROWE that at some time during

the trials of three members of the Ku Klux Klan, for

Killing Mrs. VIOLA LIUZZO, he had advised Mr. JOHN DOAR,

Assistant Attorney General, that they had been introducing

testimony from one Mr. LEROY MOTON, who was identifying

himself under oath as the man present in the automobile

with Mrs. LIUZZO when she was shot. Mr. ROwE had advised

Mr. DOAR that Mr. MOTON was not the same man who was in

the auto with Mrs. LIUZZO when she was shot.

UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT

COMMITTEE TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL

OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO

to these questions, MI, SHANAHAN testified that Mr. ROWE

had at some point during these trial proceedings, seen

either in person or a photograph in the newspaper of

MI. LEROY MOTON, and had advised Mr. SHANAHAN that this

man was not the same man he had seen riding in the car

with Mrs. LIUZZO. At the next opportunity, Mr. SHANAHAN

contacted Mr. JOHN DOAR and had Mr. ROWE relate to Mr.

DOAR his opinion concerning the identity of LEROY MOTON

as the man present in the car with LIUZZO. Mr. SHANAHAN

further testified that he did not know what, if any,

impression this had on Mr.. DOAR and the further content

of the trial.

At a point the interview appeared to be over

and Mr. KELLY and MI. SHANAHAN conversed off the record,

during which conversation MI. KELIY related that Mr. ROWE

had currently had some difficulties with Mr. DOAR and the

Department of Justice after the FBI had relocated him in

another part of the country and that some of the statements

being made by Mr. ROWE concerned his treatment by the

Department of Justice after he was no longer under FBI

control.

MT. SHANAHAN mentioned that he recalled that

GARY THOMAS ROWE received a written agreement signed by

Attorney General NICHOLAS D. KATZENBACH, which outlined

what agreement would exist between Mr. ROWE and the

Department of Justice. Mr. KELLY asked Mr. SHANAHAN to

go back on the record and relate this under oath, which

was done.

Mr. SHANAHAN testified only that he had been

present during negotiations between MI. ROWE and Mr.

DOAR about this agreement and had seen the agreement

furnished to Mr. ROWE prior to Mr. ROWE's testimony during

the Federal trial in Montgomery, Alabama.
