QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

....You do use informants and do instruct them to

spread dissention among certain groups that they are

informing on, do you not?

We did when we had the COINTEL programs which were

discontinued in 1971, and I think the Klan is probably one

of the best examples of a situation where the law was

ineffective at the time. We heard the term, State's Rights

used much more than we hear today. We saw with the

Little Rock situation the President of the United States

sending in the troops pointing out the necessity to use

local law enforcement. We must have local law enforcement

use the troops only as a last resort. When you have a

situation like this where you do try to preserve the

respective roles in law enforcement, you have historical

problems.

With the Klan coming along, we had situations where

the FBI and the Federal Government was almost powerless

to act. We had local law enforcement officers in some

areas participating in Klan violence. The incidents

mentioned by Mr. Rowe--everyone of those he saw them from the

lowest level--the informant.

He didn't see what action

was taken with that information as he pointed out during

his testimony. Our files show that this information was

reported to the police departments in every instance.

We also know that in certain instances the infor-

mation upon being received was not being acted upon. We

also disseminated simultaneously through letterhead

QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

memorandum to the Department of Justice the problem.

And here we were--the FBI--in a position where we had no

authority in the absence of an instruction from the

Department of Justice to make an arrest. Section 241

and 242 don't cover it because you don't have evidence

of a conspiracy. It ultimately resulted in a situation

where the Department called in U. S. Marshals who do have

authority similar to local law enforcement officials.

So historically, in those days, we were just as

frustrated as anyone else was, that when we got information

from someone like Mr. Rowe--good information, reliable

information--and it was passed on to those who had the

responsibility to do something about it, it was not always

acted upon as he indicated.

In none of these cases, then, there was adequate

evidence of conspiracy to give you jurisdiction to act.

The Departmental rules at that time, and still do,

require Departmental approval where you have a conspiracy.

Under 241, it takes two or more persons acting together.

You can have a mob scene and you can have blacks and whites

belting each other, but unless you can show that those that

initiated the action acted in concert, in a conspiracy, you

have no violation.

Congress recognized this and it wasn't until 1968

that they came along and added Section 245 to the Civil

Rights Statute which added punitive measures against an

QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

individual. There didn't have to be a conspiracy. This

was a problem that the whole country was grappling with--

the President of the United States, Attorneys General--we

were in a situation where we had rank lawlessness taking

place. As you know from the memorandum we sent you that

we sent to the Attorney General the accomplishments we were

able to obtain in preventing violence and in neutralizing

the Klan and that was one of the reasons.

....A local town meeting on a controversial social

issue might result in disruption. It might be by hecklers

rather than by those holding the meeting. Does this

mean that the Bureau should investigate all groups

organizing or participating in such meetings because

they may result in violent government disruption?

No sir, and we don't....

Isn't that how you justify spying on almost every

aspect of the peace movement?

No six. When we monitor demonstrations, we monitor

demonstrations where we have an indication that the

demonstration itself is sponsored by a group that we have

an investigative interest in, a valid investigative

interest in, or where members of one of these groups are

participating where there is a potential that they might

change the peaceful nature of the demonstration.

This is our closest question of trying to draw

guidelines to avoid getting into an area of infringing

on the lst Amendment right, yet at the same time, being

- 3 -

NW 55212 DocId: 32989794 Page 35

## Page 36

:

aware of groups such as we have had in greater numbers

in the past than we do at the present time. We have had

periods where the demonstrations have been rather severe

and the courts have said that the FBI has the right,

and indeed the duty, to keep itself informed with respect

to the possible commission of crime. It is not obliged

to wear blinders until it may be too late for prevention.

Now that's a good statement if applied in a clear-cut

case.

QUESTION:

MR. WANNALL:

MR. ADAMS:

Our problem is where we have a demonstration and

we have to make a judgment call as to whether it is one

that clearly fits the criteria of enabling us to monitor

the activities. That's where I think most of our disagree-

ments fall.

In the Rowe Case, in the Rowe testimony that we just

heard, what was the rationale again for not intervening when

violence was known about. I know we have asked this several

times--I'm still having trouble understanding what the

rationale, Mr. Wannall, was in not intervening in the Rowe

situation when violence was known.

Senator Schweiker, Mr. Adams did address himself to

that and if you have no objections, I'll ask that he be

the one to answer the question.

The problem we had at the time, and it is the problem

today, we are an investigative agency; we do not have

police powers even like the U. S. Marshals do. The Marshals

-4 -

NW 55212 DocId: 32989794 Page 36

## Page 37

:

since about 1795 I guess, or some period like that, had

authorities that almost border on what a sheriff has. We

are the investigative agency of the Department of Justice,

and during these times the Department of Justice had us

maintain the role of an investigative agency.

We were to report on activities. We furnished the

information to the local police who had an obligation to

act. We furnished it to the Department of Justice in those

areas where the local police did not act. It resulted

finally in the Attorney General sending 500 U. S. Marshals

down to guarantee the safety of people who were trying to

march in protest of their civil rights.

This was an extraordinary measure because it came at

a time of Civil Rights versus Federal Rights and yet there

was a breakdown in law enforcement in certain areas of the

country. This doesn't mean to indict all law enforcement

agencies in the south at the time either, because many of

them did act upon the information that was furnished to

them. But we have no authority to make an arrest on the

spot because we would not have had evidence that was a

conspiracy available. We could do absolutely nothing in

that regard. In Little Rock the decision was made, for

instance, that if any arrests need to be made, the Army

should make them. And next to the Army, the U. S. Marshals

should make them--not the FBI, even though we developed

the violations. We have over the years as you know at the

QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

QUESTION:

MR ADAMS:

Time there were many questions raised. Why doesn't the

FBI stop this? Why don't you do something about it? Well,

we took the other route and effectively destroyed the Klan

as far as committing acts of violence and, of course, we

exceeded statutory guidelines in that area.

What would be wrong, just following up on your point

there, Mr. Adams, with setting up a program since it is

obvious to me that a lot of our informers are going to

have preknowledge of violence of using U. S. Marshals on

some kind of long-range basis to prevent violence?

We do. We have them in Boston in connection with

the busing incident. We are investigating the violations

under the Civil Rights Act, but the Marshals are in

Boston. They are in Louisville, I believe, at the same

time and this is the approach that the Federal Government

finally recognized.

On an immediate and fairly contemporary basis that

kind of help can be sought instantly as opposed to waiting

till it gets to a Boston state. I realize a departure from

the past and not saying it isn't, but it seems to me we need

a better remedy than we have.

Well, fortunately we are at a time where conditions have

subsided in the country even from the 60's and the 70's, or

50's and 60's. We report to the Department of Justice on

potential trouble spots around the country as we learn of them

so that the Department will be aware of them. The planning

QUESTION:

for Boston, for instance, took place a year in advance, with

state officials, city officials, the Department of Justice

and the FBI sitting down together saying "How are we going to

protect the situation in Boston"? I think we have learned a

lot from the days back in the early 60's. But, the Government

had no mechanics which protected people at that time.

Next I would like to ask, back in 1965, I guess during

the height of the effort to destroy the klans as you put it

a few moments ago, I believe the FBI has released figures that

we had something like 2,000 informers of some kind or another

infiltrating the Klan out of roughly 10,000 estimated member-

ship.

MR. ADAMS:

QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

That's right.

I believe these are FBI figures or estimates. ' That would

mean that 1 out of every 5 members of the Klan at that point

was an informant paid by the Government and I believe the

figure goes on to indicate that 70 percent of the new members

in the Klan that year were FBI informants. Isn't that an

awful overwhelming quantity of people to put in an effort such

as that? I'm not criticizing that we shouldn't have informants

in the Klan and know what is going on to revert violence but it

just seems to me that the tail is sort of wagging the dog. For

example today we supposedly have only 1594 total informants,

both domestic informants and potential informants. Yet, here

we have 2,000 in just the Klan alone.

Well, this number of 2,000 did include all racial matters

and informants at that particular time and I think the figures

QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

we tried to reconstruct as to the actual number of Klan

informants in relaton to Klan members was around 6 percent, I

think after we had read some of the testimony on it. Isn't that

right, Bill? Now the problem we had on the Klan is the Klan

had a group called the Action Group. This was the group if you

remember from Mr. Rowe's

testimony that he was left out of in

the beginning. He attended the open meetings and heard all the

hoorahs and this type of information but he never knew what was

going on because each one had an Action Group that went out and

considered themselves in the missionary field. Theirs was the

violence. In order to penetrate those you have to direct as

many informants as you possibly can against it. Bear in mind

that I think the newspapers, the President, Congress, everyone,

was concerned about the murder of the three civil rights

workers, the Lemul Penn case, the Violet Liuzzo case, the

bombings of the church in Birmingham. We were faced with one

tremendous problem at that time.

I acknowledge that.

Our only approach was through informants. Through the

use of informants we solved these cases. The ones that were

solved. There were some of the bombing cases we never solved.

They're extremely difficult, but, these informants as we told

the Attorney General and as we told the President, we moved

informants like Mr. Rowe up to the top leadership. He was the

bodyguard to the head man. He was in a position where he

could see that this could continue forever unless we could

QUESTION:

MR ADAMS:

QUESTION:

create enough disruption that these members will realize that

if I go out and murder three civil rights, even though the

Sheriff and other law enforcement officers are in on it, if

that were the case, and in some of that was the case, that I

will be caught, and that's what we did, and that's why violence

stopped because the Klan was insecure and just like you say

20 percent, they thought

• 50 percent of their members ultimately

were Klan members, and they didn't dare engage in these acts of

violence because they knew they couldn't control the conspiracy

any longer.

I just have one quick question. Is it correct that in

1971 we were using around 6500 informers for a black ghetto

situation?

I'm not sure if that's the year. We did have a year

where we had a number like that of around 6000 and that was

the time when the cities were being burned. Detroit, Washington,

areas like this, we were given a mandate to know what the

situation is, where is violence going to break out next. They

weren't informants like an individual that is penetrating an

organization. They were listening posts in the community that

would help

tell us that we have another group here that is

getting ready to start another fire fight or something.

... Without going into that subject further of course we

have had considerable evidence this morning where no attempt

was made to prevent crime when you had information that it

was going to occur. I am sure there were instances where

you have.

MR. ADAMS:

QUESTION:

We disseminated every single item which he reported to us.

To a police department which you knew was an accomplice to

the crime.

Not necessarily knew.

Your informant told you that, hadn't he?

The informant is on one level. We have other informants

and we have other information.

You were aware that he had worked with certain members of

the Birmingham Police in order...

That's right. He furnished many other instances also.

So you really weren't doing a whole lot to prevent that

incident by telling the people who were already a part of it.

We were doing everything we could lawfully do at the

time and finally the situation was corrected when the Department

agreeing that we had no further jurisdiction, sent the U.s.

Marshals down to perform certain law enforcement functions.

...This brings up the point as to what kind of control

you can exercise over this kind of informant and to this

kind of organization and to what extent an effort is made to

prevent these informants from engaging in the kind of thing

that you were supposedly trying to prevent.

A good example of this was Mr. Rowe who became active in

an Action Group and we told him to get out or we were no longer

using him as an informant in spite of the information he had

furnished in the past. We have cases, Senator where we have had

MR. ADAMS:

QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

QUESTION:

We did not tell him to participate in violent activities.

That's what he said.

I know that's what he says, but that's what lawsuits

are all about is that there are two sides to issues and our

Agent handlers have advised us, and I believe have advised your

staff members, that at no time did they advise him to engage

in violence.

Just to do what was necessary to get the information.

I do not think they made any such statement to him

along that line either and we have informants who have gotten

involved in the violation of a law and we have immediately

converted their status from an informant to the subject and

have prosecuted I would say off hand, I can think of around

20 informants that we have prosecuted for violating the laws

once it came to our attention and even to show you our policy

of disseminating information on violence in this case during

the review of the matter the Agents have told me that they

found one case where an Agent had been working 24 hours a

day and he was a little late in disseminating the information

to the police department. No violence occurred but it showed

up in a file review and he was censured for his delay in

properly notifying local authorities. So we not only

have a policy, I feel that we do follow reasonable safeguards

in order to carry it out, including periodic review of all

informant files.

Mr. Rowe's statement is substantiated to some extent with

an acknowledgment by the Agent in Charge that if he were going

to be a Klansman and he happened to be with someone and they

decided to do something, he couldn't be an angel. These are

words of the Agent. And be a good informant. He wouldn't

take the lead but the implication is that he would have

to go along or would have to be involved if he was going

to maintain his liability as a ---

There is no question that an informant at times will

have to be present during demonstrations, riots, fistfights

that take place but I believe his statement was to the

effect that, and I was sitting in the back of the room and I do

not recall it exactly, but that some of them were beat with

chains and I did not hear whether he said he beat someone with

a chain or not but I rather doubt that he did, because it is

one thing being present, it is another thing taking an

active part in a criminal action.

It's true. He was close enought to get his throat cut

apparently.

How does the collection of information about an

individual's personal life, social, sex life and becoming

involved in that sex life or social life is a requirement for

law enforcement or crime prevention.

Our Agent handlers have advised us on Mr. Rowe that

they gave him no such instruction, they had no such knowledge

concerning it and I can't see where it would be of any

value whatsoever.

Furor On Schorr

RoleImLeaKk

Representative Samuel S. Stratton (Dem.), f

By RICHARD DUDMAN

Chief Washingson Correspondent

!. Now ro have a restion racy in presen

hoped to have a resolution ready to present

on the House floor before the end of this:

WASHINGTON - Daniel Schorr, the

CBS News correspondent who made

public a secret congressional report last

week, has become the center of a

swirling debate over information leaks,

journalistic ethics and freedom of the

press.

Iwo members of Congress want to

prosecute him. The New York Times

castigated him in an editorial, charging

that he "did responsible journalism a

disservice" by "making the report

available for cash sale."

The furor over the leak has overshadowed

the substance of the repoit so much that some

cynics suspect the Ford Administration of

i promoting the dispute as a distraction.

As published in the New York Village

Voice, the report accused the Central Intelli

¿gence Agency of repeated intelligence fail-

ures in Vietnam, in the 1973 Arab-Israeii

war, in the United States global military

alert against the Soviet Union at the end of

that war, in the 1974 Turkish invasion of

Cyprus and in the 1974 coup.in Portugal.

IT ACCUSED Secretary of State Henry A.

Kissinger of selling out the Kurdish rebellion

last year, with the loss of thousards of lives,

in a deal between Tran and Iraq. Il charged

him with a "passion for secrecy" in efforts

to "control dissemination and analysis of

data" inside the bureaucracy, and with

making "comments... at variance with the

facts" about the handling of suspected Soviet

violations of the nuclear strategic arms

accords of 1972.

Representative Otis G. Pike (Dem.), New

York, chairman of the House Select Commit-

tee on Inteiligence, has said he suspected

that the Central Intelligence Agency leaked

the report to discredit the committee. Presi-

dent Gerald R. Ford told a press cunicrence

last night that it had been leaked by

member of Congress or a House stafi

report before the House voted Jan. 29 not to

make it public.

Schorr. as well as reporters for the New

York Times, the Washington Post and other

news orgonizations, had been reporting infor-

mation trom the report, but it was not clear

whether any of them had obtained a copy.

Schorr, however, displayed the cover of

Morgan told the Post-Dispatch:

telephone call from someone who told me

Schorr had the report. I called Schorr, and

he said he did. He said he was looking for a

publisher. He wanted something respectable

— not the National Lawyers' Guild. There

was no question that Schorr had in mind

making some money for some First Amend-

ment cause."

One or the other thought of the Reporters'

Committee for Freedom of the Press, a group

formed during the Nixon Administration to

protect reporters against government sur-

veillance and retaliation.

Schorr confirms this account generally. He

told the Post-Dispatch he had bsen trying to

decide how to get the full report published.

This was after he had used the high points in

his CBS broadcasts. The idea of approaching

the Reporters' Committee had emerged in

• conversations with several other persons, he

"At that point I got a call from Morgan," A

Schorr said. "He told me, 'Look, we'd like to

publish that report of yours. I saw you with it

kon TV. You do have it, don't ycu?"

SCHORR RECALLS that he acknowledged

having a copy, complimented Morgan on his

timing, and said all he wanted from the

ACLU was the name of a publisher.

"I didn't want a crusader's cause," Schorr

told the Post-Dispatch. "I said all I wanted

was to do it as a simple, casua:, I-ca.i-do-it-

no-other-way thing. I said I wanted to make

sure that whatever money came out of it

would go, not to the ACLU, but to something

more specifically on freedom of the press."

Morgan telephoned Jack Neison, Washing-

ton bureau chief of the Los Angeles Times, a

close friend and one of the six unpaid

trustees of the Reporters' Committee.

Nelson: was enthusiastic about the prospect

got getting some muney for the committee,

which operates on a shoestring and is always

seeking funds to meet expenses of its small

office staff and its mailings of reports or

developments involving freedom of the press:

Nelson asked his editors at the Los

Angeles Times if they wanted tu run the text

of the report. He was told they would have to

see it first and then decide what to do with it.

By that time, other trustees were getting

into the sitation. Jack: C. Landau of the

Newhouse News Service and Fred Graham

of CBS News, after a telephone poll of the

trustees, put Schorr in touch with a New

York lawyer who worked as a publishing

agent.

ANOTHER NEWS EXECUTIVE who be-

corne interested in the matter was Marry

Resenteld, assirtant managing editor for

natonal affairs at the Washington Post. He,

100, knew about Schorr's reports on the air

and suspected Schorr might have a cops.

"I'm going into this detail because I don't

want it to seern that Schorr was peddling the

report for money. He wasn't."

Rosenfeld recalled that Schorr said he

would have to clear any such arrangement

with CBS News. But

Rosenfeld said his

superiors, executive editor Benjamin C.

Bradlee and managing editor Howard Si-

mons objected to the idea on the ground that

the Washington Post would not want to

reciprocate and give any of its documents to

CBS. Rosenfeld said he called Schorr the

next morning and withdrew the proposal.

Their conversation would have remained

confidential, Rosenfeld says, had it not been

for another conversation a few days later

between Schorr and a Washington Post

Stern says he has three pages of typed

notes to prove that Schorr denied repeatedly

that he had provided the report to the Village

Voice, directly or indirectly.

STERN SAYS he already knew that Schor

had furnished the report to the newspaper.

Stern wrote a story reporting Schorr's denial

• but stating that "other sources familiar with

"the hush-hush developments of the story say

that CBS correspondent Daniel Schorr, who

covered the intelligence committee for his

network, was instrumental in transmitting

the report" to the Village Voice.

Schorr says that the New York lawyer,

whom he refuses to name, found several

paperback book publishers leery of the

proposal. He said some of them hoped a joint

publication with a newspaper might be

Eventually, however, the lawyer came up

with an offer from Clay Felker, publisher of

New York magazine and the Village Voice.

Schorr, dealing through the lawyer, says he

• set three conditions-that the report be

published in full, that Felker give some

money to the Reporters' Committee, and that

Felker premise confidentiality.

Schorr explained that he thought at that

time that more than one copy might be ai

large. He said if his name was kept out of it,

tnat would establish an "additional buffer"

to protect his source

Felker says, howaver, that he had not made

any contribution and does not intend to make

on the reality of making a contribution to

Page 56

FELKER SAID he had not figured how

much it had cost the Voice to publisti most of

the document as a 24-page lift-cut section of

the regular weckly newspaper. He said the

extra cost was roughly the same as the cost

of a normal issue of the Voice

Felker, as most of those interviewed about

the story of the Pike papers, expressed

irritation over the editorial last Sunday in

the New York Times. It was headed, "Selling

Secrets." It stated that when Schorr passed

the report to the Voice, there was "an

arrangement under which money passed

from the Voice to the Reporters' Committee

for Freedom of the Press, a group dedicated

to defense of the First Amendment.

The Times said: "To put it bluntly, while

reporters and news organizations have right-

ly declined to accept the Government's

judgment on what documents it is appropri-

ate to publish, it is flatly wrong for reporters

to be invoived in any commercial traffic in

such documents."

Felker attributed the Times's attitude to

the unwelcome competition from the Voice.

"The Times is stunned," he said.

Voice's circulation is going up in New York.

and theirs is going down. They can't stand it.

The Times is suffering these days."

On publication of the document, he said:

"We are in the business of finding the news

and printing it. Readers don't care where wa

WILLIAM SMALL, vice president of CBS'

whether CBS objected to a reposter's furnish-

"Dan indeed made everything available to

Ford Security Plan

Still Has Loopholes

For Polical Abuse

? By RICHARD DUDMAN

Chief Washiugton Correspondent

WASHINGTON

ONE OF PRESIDENT Gerald R.

Ford's biggest tasks has been to

straighten out what officials call the

American "intelligence community."

Several of the agencies included in

the community were corrupted to some

degree by the Watergate scandal. To

take random examples, the Central

Intelligence Agency provided disguises

and false identities for White House.

burglars, a director of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation burned dochl-

mentary evidence in his backyard, and

political enemies of the Nixon Adminis-

tration were confident that the Internal

Revenue Service was harassing them

with special tax audits.

Illegal letter openings, wiretaps, surveil-

lance, slander and provocation at home, as

well as efforts abruce to assascinate foreign

leaders, interfere in foreign elections, foment

coups and even vage secret wars-all tiese

gäve the CIA and the rest of the intelligence

cummunity a bad nome.

Mr. Ford brought forth his remedy this

week. It was a package of new Government

orders, proposals for new legislation and

appeintmen of a new civilian oversight

committee.

Il's problem essentially was how to carro

en the business of government effectively

while at the same time irsulating the

grameit machinery agairit po'itical

abuse ny sore future Nixon.

Some of the President's top aids put the

matte: in different words in a briefing giver

THE OPENING FLAS! card in a slide

presentation put it this way:

"To ensure that

•?"The United States has a strong and

effective capability to gather and evaluat:

foreign intelligence and conduct necessary

;covert operations.

"These activities are conducted in a

constitutional and lawful manner and never -

aimed at our own citizens."

From the President on down, the greate.

emShasis appeared to be on the first of those

to objectives. Mr. Ford's package kept the

CIA intact, rejecting the advice of some

critics who had urged a separation of covert

perations from intelligence gathering on th

round that the one distorted the other whe

operational decisions demanded production

of facts to support them.

The Ford package also ignored the Rocke-

feller Commission's recommendation last

year that careful consideration be given to

whether the CIA's budget should be made

public, particularly in the light of a provision,

of the Constitution that requires regular

publication of "the receipts and expenditures.

of all public money."

A question arose immediately, too, aboud

the President's recommendation that Con-

gress streamline its overseeing function and

create a single joint committee on intelli-

gence to take the place of the four commit-

tees to which intelligence agencics must

report.

Ir. Ford told Congress that the changd

wouid reduce the risks of disclosure o!

Government secrets and "facilitate the ef.

forts of the Administration to keep the

Congress fully informed of foreign intelli.

gence activities."

The order prohibits physical surveillance

against any U.S. citizen, U.S. corporation or

resident alien-"unless" it comes under a

iprogram approved by the agency head and is

directed against a former agency employe or

contractor to protect intelligence sources or

methods or national security information.

Exceptions likewise are included in guar-

antees against physical searches without

consent, opening of mail, examination of

federal tax returns, infiltration of private

organizations, and wire taps.

In various forms, the question kept arising

as to what would prevent a President from

once more misusing the intelligence machin-

ery to help strengthen his own political

position.

The new CIA director, George Bush, was

asked what would happen when someone in

his position was directed in the future to

President Ford appears to be constructive

It calls for placing all policy direction for

President, the Vice President, and the

Secretaries of State and Defense.

It calls for combining all the operations of

the Central Intelligance Agency, the Penta-

gon's Defense Intelligence Agency and the

National Security Agency and other intelli-

gence units under one command structure

headed by the new director of the CiA,

George Bush.

It aiso would create a new Oversight

Board made up of private citizens "to

opcrations."

*To prevent possible abuses, Mr. Ford said

his office would propose "a comprehensive

set of public guidelines" to safeguard civil

rights, plus eventual legislation "to provide

judicial safeguards agamst electronic sur-

veal that information properly."

Adoption of this plan shouid go a long way!

toward rebuilding the effectiveness of U.S!

intelligence operations and restoring confi-

dence in the CIA and other agencies engaged

in this activity.

Congress should carry out its end of the

bargain to help restore the greatly dimin-

ished effectiveness of government agencies

that have been hampered by non-stop con-
