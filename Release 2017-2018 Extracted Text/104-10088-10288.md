3. Under the extraordinary

Ress of

effort to develop information

on the assassin and

the assassination, copies of the photograph were

made available by CIA's Mexico Station Chief on the afternoon of

22 November to the local FBI representative, and later that day,

assertedly on the decision of

the Ambassador, copies were conveyed by

an FBI representative by a special flight carried

out by the U.S. Naval

Attache

to the Dallas office of the FBI for possible use in the ongoing

investigation. One photograph, cropped by the FBI, was shown to

Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD (Lee Harvey OSWALD's mother) in Dallas on the

evening of

After arrival and check-in to

is unknown. The time of his second Cuban Embassy visit was about

1600 hours (i.e., just before closing). Sometime between the two

OSWALD made at least two calls,

at 1031 and 1045 hours,

to the

oviet Embassy. He identified himself

twice during the second call when he talked with OBYEDKOV--a guard--

and referred to his talk on Saturday, probably with KOSTIKOV. There

was no photographic coverage of OSWALD on 1 October; if the follow-

ing reasoning is correct, that was as it should be.. From the context

of the two calls, there would have been no reason for him to go to

the Embassy. His case had clearly been placed at the sufferance of

the USSR Embassy in Washington. His two calls on 1 October were

concerned with whether any reply had been received from Washington.

Under

those circumstances, it is unreasonable to believe OSWALD

Neither of these errors are significant (though they persist in the

c. Paragraph (2) of the Mexico Station's report, which dealt with

a concurrent, but separate, phenomenon, the description of an individual

observed going into and out of the Soviet Embassy, had been locked on to

Lee OSWALD as an alleged descriptive fact. The Station's qualification,

"appeared to be an American," was transformed in the flat designation of

the unidentified

individual. as "The American."
