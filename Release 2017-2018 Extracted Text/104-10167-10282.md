2.

Co Prior to Diaz' departur. the Cuban A1r Force had purchased one

C-l6 and one B-25 aircraft in the Miani area. The aireraft

are in BYERS' custody at present, but are in Fiorini's name.

This was done to circument refusal of the United States

Goverment to grant export licenses. Until 7 July Florind

was attempting to force BYERS to sell the aircraft and turn

the money over to him (Fiorini).

Do On 8 July, togetoer with Sergio Diaz, Florini asked BYERS

to hold onto the Cal6 and sell the B-25. Both men said

they would need the C-lo for their revolutionary plans.

Eo The Cuban Air Force, according to BYERS, is aware of the

situation concerning the two aircraft and will probably

attempt to forestall any disposition other than one which

will give them ultimate possession of the planes.

4. Reichhard saya that the local FI has su setire case on

Florint.
