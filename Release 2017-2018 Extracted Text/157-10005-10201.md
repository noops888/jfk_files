Most documents in the ZRRIFLF files indicate that its

primary purpose was to recruit foreigners

However, there are a few more incriminating papers which seem

to indicate a second purpose of ZRRIFLE, probably, the estab-

1ishment of an assassination capability and perhaps even a

plan to use one agent, (Jose Marie Andre Mankel (QJWIN), in an

assassination attempt in the Congo.

"I reter specifically to

documents summarized, in Tab C, at paragraph 11, page 4; para-

graph 24, page 1: paragraph 2, page 8: paragraph 1, page 91

paragraph 3, page

I definitely feel we should obtain copies of the

documents underlined above, as well as one which indicates

some ZRRIFLE activity in the Miami area, summarized at para-

graph 4, page 9, Tab C. Also, we should obtain a copy of the

document, referred to above, in which McCone advocated that

dissident Cubans bring about

"the eventual liquidation of the

Castro/communist entourage.

" I have prepared a letter for

your signature requesting them, attached hereto.
