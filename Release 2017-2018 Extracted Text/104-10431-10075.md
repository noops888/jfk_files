According to the New York Times for 10 Decenber,

categorically states that loe Farvey Oswald was the

that he acted alone, and that there is no evi-

In the event that Nr. Slusser continues to

Inslat that the President was nurdered by the Sovlet s0-

cret police, the following additional negative indications

and observations may be of some value.

2.

Long standing KGB practice generally forbids

agents

serving outside the USS& to have any contact with

donestic communist parties or with Soviet embassles or

consulates.

This prohibition, designed to reduce the

possibilities of compronise to a mininun, 18 probably most

stringently applied to agents on extrerely sensitive mis

Yet Oswald blazed a trail to the Soviets which was

He corresponded with the national headquarters

of the Cormunist Party USA--apparently with some regular-

addition to his well-know leftist political activitles.

ho also subscribed to the Dally Worker and a Trotskyite:

pubilcation, allegedly received newspapers fron the Sov

let Unlon, and asked last June that his passport be

ro-valldated for travel to the USSR.

Certain lacets of Oswald's activities in the

USSE also argue strongly that the KGB would never have

recrulted him for a mission of any kind. First, there

Oswald's former commanding officer, thie Included the

that he had made good on his boast about the radars

could easily lead to arrest and Indictent on a charge

secondly, Sovlet "executive action" agents

(assassins, saboteurs and terrorists) are carefully

selected by the IGB and specifically tralned for their

missions.

Oswald very probably ruled hluself out of

any consideration. for this kind of operation. On

14 November 1959, Moscow refused his request for Sov

fet citizenship; Shortly thereafter, he becane des

pondent and reportedly attempted to kill hinsolf by

slashing his wrists.

Even if the EGB bad not earlier

noted signs of mental aberratlons, the sulcide try pre

sumably furnished convincing evidence that Oswald vas

not agent material.

5. Oswald's activitles on a Dallas rifle range on

17 November are of some interest both as circumstantial

evidence of prior planning to assassinate the President

and as one more negatlve indication of XGB Involvement.

Oswald was firing at a range of 100 yards. He was assigned

to target number 3, but according to witnesses, was actu

aLy Iring at targets 7, 8, and 9. Be was thus firing

through an nre of approximately lo degrees and obviously

seems to have been simulating fire at a noving target.

may be treated in the IBI toport. Pending Its publion

ton, they are listed below for whatever they may be worth.

2): In an interview last august, Oswald stated

that his father-In-law was a sovlet army colonel who

taught him to drink vodsa when he came to court karan.

After the assassination, however, Nrs. Ruth Paine (some-

time Oswald Irlend and landlady) stated thnt Marina's

father, a colonel, had died when Marina was an infant.

b) To the tane of some $437, the US picked

up the tab for Osuald's return to this country.

This

loan was repald between October 1962 and January 1963.

During this period, Oswald was earning $50 per veer.

Thus, over half of

his total earnings went to the govern-

ment and he supported himself, his wife and child on

somewhat less than $25 weekly. Hs rent at that time

was $59 per month.

The poastbility that he received out

side help In repaying the government apparently hasnnot

been raised in the press.

In contraat to the letters Oswald wrote

to bls mother, Governor Connally and Senntor Tower, his

letters to the Falr Play for Cuba Committee are rather

surprisingly literate.

They do not appear to contaln

his frequent misspellings and ungramatical language.

There have been no suggestions that he received help in

framing the letters, and he told the IPCC that he was

Iinancing his activitles on its behalf out of his ow

pocket.

There is increasing ovidence that Cavald

and his wiie vere not happily narried. She vas well-

liked and be was unpopular.

She soned genuinely lond

of tho United States, did not share his anti-merican

viers and sosetines spoke of the hard life in the sov

let Valon.

Oswald resented her Iriends and bent her

up on at least one occasion.

Since he could not have

planned the assassination of the President prior to

26 September-whon tbe Dallas trip vas announced could

1t be that his appliention los a passport (without one

for Marina) on 29 Juno, his application for & lexican

visa on 17 September and his trlp to Mexico City on

26 Beptember simply indicate that be planned to desert

his wife and soek refuge in the sertet Unlon?

•) Despite Mrs. Palne's testinony that

Oswald could not drive, witnesses sald he drove klusell

to the Dallas rifle range on one of his vialts..

Ho was

driven there by as unidentified man on his other trip.

One witness also clalas that two non wore lavolved in the

attempt-evidently by Oswald--to shoot General walker

MEMO FOR THE RECORD:

CorRections to Record

SUBJECT: DCI Testimony before the Warren Commission

TI. 0/SR called me in re matter of correcting record of DCI's

testimony before the Warren Commission. On page 6582 of transcript,

Mr. Allen DULLES asked one of the key questions in the inquiry.

Unfortunately, the question was badly phrased and contained an

accurate statement.

It was usggested that the following modification

be made for the final record:

Melief that mirk

ME CD

D: Does your answer, Mr. McCONE, include a negation

of any belief that OSWALD was working for or on behalf

of the Soviet intelligence services (originally phrased:

on behalf of the Soveet Union) at any time?.

This would require a slight change in Mr. MCCONE's testimony in

which the words "intelligence services" would be substituted for

HUnion!

2. :

In response to C/SR's request: I provided him with à brief

statement to

the effect that other

defectors to the USSR had received

subsidies or salary supplements vis the MVD.

The Statement also in-

cluded information concerning the role of the MVD in 1959 - 61.

1. According to his own statements, Lee Harvey OSWALD

received a lump

sum of 5000 old rubles and a monthly salary

supplemented by 700 old rubles. These funds were provided

to him through the Soviet Red Cross, but OSWALD indicated his

belief that these funds actually came from the Ministry of

Internal Affairs (MVD).

2. Several other Americans are known to have received

salary supplements while resident in the USSR. In two cases

the Soviet Red Cross reportedly supported the defector and his

family for as

long

as six months. prior

to resettlement.

other cases it was not specified where the aid came

other than Soviet Government or Soviet authorities.

Frons aid

included payment of espenses until resettlement, medcial care,

above-average salary for job done, and lump-sum payments in

varying amounts.

3.

Until January 1960, the All-Union Ministry of Internal

Affairs (MVD) of the USSR was responsible for civil police func-

tions (crime detection, traffic controls,

administration

of internal document controls, fire fighting and civil defense.

In January 1960, the All-Union MVD was abolished and its func-

tions were transferred to the MVD's of the fifteen républics:

of the USSR..

The republic MVDs were renamed Ministeries for

Maintenance of Public Order (MOOP) in mid 1962•
