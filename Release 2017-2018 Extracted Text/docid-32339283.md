But when an African leader did succeed in bettering his people's condi-

capitalists did not stand the loss.

1. The information below was acquired by SUGAR from a former

who talked with Allan Krebs, an American leftist who is Director

the Free University in New York City and who is close to Russell

Stetler and John Gerassi.

2. Stetler spends most of his time travelling between

the

Us and London to consult with Ralph Schoenman, Director of the Bertran

Russell Peace Foundation (BRPF) regarding the Foundation's activities.

There are now only three officials in the BRPF. Stetler is undecided

about his political future and is considering the possibility of

returning to graduate school.

BRPF funds at his disposal and sometimes there are great financial

crises. At times Stetler is very bitter about Schoenman's methods

who work for him".

1. Source Comment:

While in London during the week of 17 July,

Gerassi said he was en route to Havana where he was to be an observer

at the Latin American Solidarity Organization (LASO) Conference. He

believed the Cuban attitude has changed considerably in the past year

and that the Moscow-leaning Communists are losing all their influence.

The former repressive measures in Cuba against homosexuals, beatniks

and other deviants have been dropped. Concerning the International

War Crimes Tribunal, Gerassi appeared convinced that the Tribunal's

Second Session will

be held in Stockholm rather than in Copenhagen

or some other city. He said that he will testify at the event in any

case.

2. Field Comment: The First Session of the Tribunal was sponsored

Klag's SCLC.

He lives, with Betty Jones, a white Minnesota girl, at

2014 North Devton, Chicago, Ill. 60614 (phone 477-1602).

2. Hollins said that salt activities in Chicago were declining, but

were not being wound up. He personally had worked during the summer on a

Federally sponsored adult school, but that had been terminated and he thought

he might be going to Callfornia. Dr. King spent little time in Chicago and

was more involved with the peace movement at present, Hollins said.

Nevertheless, he and the others (sic) remain solid supporters of King.

3. Hollins said that there were many guns in the black community, but

he seriously doubted that they would be used for anything other than self-

defense against the police, If necessary. The black leadership was chaotiC

Hollins maintained, and continually sought to gain prestige or profit at the

expense of each other and the masses.

4. Hollins thought. Chicago might remain calm, without undue incidents

for a while, but the underlying causes of the black rebellion were so great

and remained just what they had always been, that new outbreaks of violence

were also inevitable, despite the corrupt leadership. He felt that King

sought at least constructive, positive projects, but he admitted that king's

slum housing project in Chicago was impossible. The city had promised

$4,000, 000, when $40,000, 000 would not be enough, and even the $4,000,000

had never actually been allocated, he said. In general, he felt the situation

was frustrating and depressing and very gloomy in outlook.

that nany Cubana were completely convinced that the United States would Launch

In its newspaper and magazine the PLP attempts to publish

former Cuban revolutionary leader "Che" Guevara had been killed by

"revisionist" Fidel Castro. Now the PLP is embarrassed inasmuch as

Guevara appears to be alive and active in latin America.

6. The Du Bois Clubs are on the verge of closing down in New York

City because the Communist Party of the USA (CPUSA) does not want to

support irritants to the US Government, Krebs claimed. The Socialist

Workers' Party (SWP) is merging with the CPUSA; the latter hopes to

control all peace activities in the US. This is in line with the

decisions made in Stockholm 6 - 9 July 1967, at the World Conference on

Vietnam.

Father Mallette, Of St. Agatha's R.C. Church In Chicago, said that

"Fats Washington" was really Fats Crawford of the Deacons, a virtually

autonomous Chicago offshoot of the Louisians original organization. Crawfora

had been arrested recently, Mallette said. Although It was certainly true

the Deacons were heavily armed, Mallette maintained there was no evidence

that they intended to use the arms in a black rebellion. In fact, there

was hardly a Negro home in Chicago without firearms, he added, but the

amazing thing about the summer just past was that no serious riots had

occurred, although, he maintained, that there had been three occasions--

such as the police shooting of a Negro youth--when rlots "should have normally

occurred" in protest at police brutality. Thanks to the liberal amounts of

cash and jobs made available by the Daly machine, Chicago remained calm, but

the black masses also remained restivé and bribes to black leaders did not

solve their very serious problems, Mallette said.

the Negro population from sub-standard frame houses to rabbit-warren high-rise

apartment houses that also became dens of crime and vice.

Also, the scheme

was intended as a buffer for the middle-income development that sears was to

build to house its junior executives and middle-grade employees in the

vicinity, near the sears beadquarters.

3. Mallette said that white radical groups had no influence in thelblack

ghettoes and he also doubted 1f RAM even existed there, as well. It was a

gross untruth to claim there was any sort of nationwide conspiracy among black

extremists and some of the most loud-mouthed militants were the most suspicious,

who put on a good show of black militancy without ever

And when demonstrations were called,

Mallette added, they were often made luptof only a mere handful of sincere

militants, whose ranks were

Mallette was quite hostile to Dr. Martin Iuther King, whon he calle

a "phoney" and refers to as "De Lowd". He maintained that Rev. James Bevel

was deliberately used by king to terrorize waltes, who then were only too see

eager to cooperate with King to restore order.

However, Mallette maintained

that King had made serious errors in Chigago, despite an understanding with

Mayor Daly, and was now vittually halting his Chicago operations. He also

accused King and his aldes of profiteering in the slums, in collaboration with

the National Tea Company's Delfarms supermarkets.

8. Source Comment: Daniel

Watts described Father Mallette as the one

person, white or black, who knew what was happening in the black ghettoes of

Chicago. Mallette 1s young, almost fanatical in his devotion to the interests

of the black commuity, shows obvious signs of extreme fatigue or battle-

weariness.

Source coumented that Father Mallette was one of the "nost foul-

mouthed" priest he had ever net, and deseribed him as a"practicing Waite Negro".

He nevertheless remains an impressive person, who undoubtedly is one of the

rare whites who can walk with relative safety into some of the toughest black

Company news employee, regarding the July, 1967, Detroit riot

and Singleton's belief that CIA is covertly financing black

nationalist groups within the United States as part of a

vast plot to crush black militants. According to the informant,

Singleton was unable to furnish any proof in support of his

contention but asserted that CIA funds reaching small

scattered black groups will encourage them to irresponsible

actions certain to alienate white liberals and black moderates.

any proof in support of this contention, but asserted that CIA funds

reaching small scattered black groups will encourage them to irrespon

sible actions, certain to alienate white liberals and black moderates.

A list of black nationalists and other Negroes to be arrested has been

circulated to police throughout the country in readiness for mass

arrests, singleton maintained, and 13 concentration camps have been

placed in renewed condition in various parts of the country to hold

some of the thousands of blacks who will be apprehended.

In this plot,

Singleton claimed, ultra-right white groups such as the Minutenen and

Breakthru, in Detroit, will join forces with the police and the mili-

tary and the CIA to deal a crushing sudden blow to black nationalism.

3.

Concerning the Detroit situation, Singleton felt that

cooperation between Negro groups only developed after the initial

or so of rioting and that this unity was, and remains, extremely

limited in scope, being essentially a reaction of joint seli-dejense

against white outsiders Singleton did not believe that any group

planned further rioting or terrorist attacks, but he added that he hao

been told by some black nationalists that, It there were another riot

situation, there would be no firebombing (especially of black property),

attacks, entre vote ano those plot

but a more coordinated plan of attack on key communications and power

installations, e.go telephone centers, powerplants, etc.

(In connection with the above statements, Source wished to

point out that Singleton is not himself a black nationalist, and that

while his wife is active in local politics and probably has a leftist

political background, neither he nor she can be described as Communists.

Singleton himself, for instance, is not opposed to the Johnson Adminis

tration, and although not agreeing with Secretary Rusk's position on

the Vietnam War, has characterized the latter as a very courageous man.

His virtually unshakeable belief in a CIA-sponsored plot, however,

was indicative of the degree of suspicion and fear, as well as anger,

prevalent in many Negro circles.)

Speaking of his own personal plans, Singleton said he had

been encouraged by Daniel P. Moynihan to set up an all-black film

unit for riot situations, when white newsmen might not be able to cir-

culate in the black ghettoes, to shoot film which would be sold to

white film and television units.

frienaly contacts at all levels of the black community in Detroit.

General Comments

ack Meltant sotarites in the Upf gener

G

The following are some general comments made by Source,

based on his observations and recent contacts with Black Militants

and groups in various key cities of the U.S.:

1.

There is no tight organization, no cohesiveness

between the various black militant groups, ho

indication of a "Black Conspiracy" •

120

There are no apparent indications of any signi-trawr

ficant foreign ties or of any foreign money. ≤-T

3.

The ferment is based mostly on basic grievances

(housing, schooling, draft), and although

poverty funds have alleviated many sore points

in ghetto conditions, these have not yet reached

the basic problems, which continue to exist.

These funds have, however, been effective enough

to undercut the grievance platform of many militant

leaders who exploited the grievances.)

i-lo

There is very little real ideological ferment.

It is all visceral, tied to basic grievances,

or of the "Kill Whitey!" variety.

Mao literature

circulates, but few militants are literate enough,

let alone intellectual enough, to understand it.

However, a strong leader at the right moment

(1.eo, riot circumstances) could direct the mobs

and even unite the various now-uncoordinated black

nationalists.

105-930720

5.

Even the anti-draft movement is not so much a politi-

cal protest at the involvement of the U.S. in Vietnam,

as it is a manifestation of the Negro belief that

the draft is being used by the U.S. Government as an

instrument to exterminate the American Negro (they

6. The rebellion had given the novement greet strength, as police and:

military repression had broken the psychological link between the black

commnity and walte society.

Moreover, since the rebellion, white rightist

groups, such as realth, were holding nightly meetings, urging. whites to

ar and to be ready to exterminate the blacks.

Bleck people, Boggs said,

especially working class whites, would not

hesitate to apply a Hltierite

vere not convinced that wastesiginal solution" to the black problem. This

widespread conviction, he pointed out, was not the same as the feeling in

mony other cities that blacks could only "get ready to die." Rap Brown

and many young blacks were convinced of their own early deaths by waite

violence, he said.

They believed there could be no escape and, at nost,

black people could hope to destroy a large portion of America as they went

to their deaths in some sort of racial Gotterdamerung.

7. •Boggs maintained that this was not quite the case in Detroit,

because he had been able to evolve a theory of black seizure or transfer of

power that held some chance of success.

As he had been saying for years,

the cities of America are being abandoned to Negroes as whites flee to the

segregated suburbs, leaving only & waite non-residential city center surrounded

1 by black slums. Blacks in time rould seize the citles by a combination of

electoral pover and urban guerrilla warfare. He said that violence,

confrontation with the wite vorking cless, was inevitable and would be, in

the main, provoired by the whites, but the blacks were evolving much more

sophisticated means of warfare than that seen during the July rebellion in

Detroit.

There would also be economic warfare, he added, mentioning & meeting

he had had with executives of Sears to demand that one of Sears? stores in

Detroit be turned over directly to black management. He had pointed out that

Sears had not been burned out last July, which had not been an oversight, but

atrect to

it might be burzed out in the futue if the Sears executives refused to vader

stand that blackfintended to manage and administer all forms of activity

within their black citles. This was no threat to the owership of the store

by sears or to its profits, which might even rise after transfer of management

to Negroes, Boggs said.

He said that even some of the auto plants might

eventually be the target of black takeover attempts.

8. Seizure of state pover was the aim of all revolutionaries, Boggs

said, and the only power black could obtain would be Inside the white-

abandoned cities. Of course, they could also establish schemes to migrate

to virtually empty stetes, such as wyoming, and eventually oust the vaite

minority, but that was a lot more difficult than simply exerting their

numbers in the urban areas, he said. Open housing in the suburbs might foll

this concentration of black power and it was probable that the white

bourgeoisie, always less racist than the working class, was well aware of

this, but the white leadership (neither Johnson in Washington nor Reuther

1n Detroit) could not keep working class whites in line for such an effort.

10.33:

In Detroit, black cares had been trained sad were still being

trained. A political nechine was coning solialy into being, with its roots

in the black community and enjoying mited support, even from blacks who did

not agree wholeheartedly with the program, while the moderates supported 1t

too because it was visibly porting.

Black nationalists were organizing at

every level of activity and in every professional group, such as teachers,

although the black industrial workers remained basically indifferent to political

action and sole even were "brainvashed" with notions about "class walty" with

white workers.

Boggs said one of the keys to success in future rebellions was

the group of youths knows as "do-rags", l.e. who wore black cloths around their

straightened hair. They were essentially a social, extremely nihilistic and

violent, lacking any life sins, hate-filled for nites, whose hair they imitated,

and for their Negroid selves, which they partially repudiated. Boggs said that

nevertheless they represented the shock troops of the rebelllon, 1l once

aisciplined.

The black nationalist leadershly had been attemyting to reach

the "do-rags" through nationalist youth, who tended to be students from middle-

class Negro families, and was had to be constantly reproached for taking an

over-intellectual tone in dealing with this block lumpenproleteriat. (The

lavorite current reading of this element at present is a paperback novel

entitled Pimp by Iceberg slim, probably a white author but one who certainly

understood the aspirations of this sub-cless.

The book is a best-seller in

bookshops in Black ghettoes across the couatry.)

As for contacts with other black nationalist groups in other cities,

Boggs said that Rev. Cleage and he travelled agreat deal, speaking wherever

possible, and people from other cities and even Iron abroad, such as Willien

Gariner snith In Paris, were always coming to see them in Detroit, but the

situation elsewhere was at a far lower level than In Detroit. In those cities,

he said, coordination meant simply a list of telephone numbers of black leaders

who were contacted in an energency, but who generally fought against each other

and did not agree about anything except their opposition to whites. In Detroit,

there was genuine functional coordination with political/national aims and the

Detroit example was certain to spread, despite the rivalries and feuds among

blacks elsewhere, Boggs felt.

I]. Boggs stressed that he is neither anti-waite nor anti-semitic, but

insisted that all old radical groups and parties were utterly without influence

in the black communities.

In Detroit, the only white who could move freely

In the black cormunity was frank Joyce. They were sure of Frank, he added, and

they know he could be trusted to do anything that was necessary.

Joyce had a

small group of white followers and was an inväluable ally, but nost of the

white radicals would not follow his example, because they wanted white

leadership and still believed nyths about a revolutionary waite working

class, which simply was not true. The white working class was closer to

fascism than the white bourgeoisie and constantly complained of the "soft

leadership" in Washington and Lansing, Boggs added.

12. As for Robert I. Williams, Boggs said he could not understand how

Williams could even think of retuming to the USA. It was utterly impossible

and, if he were so foolish as to try, he would be dead within hours, Boggs

said.

He added that it was a miracle that he himself was not dead or in jail,

but white officials had probably correctly guessed that this might provoke

Williams had never answered a single letter that

he had written him, be added, and hed instructed Max Stanfora to go illegally

to Cuba In 1964-to the point of stealing a car to cross the Canadiaa border--

when he and Milton Henry had arranged for Stanford to travel to Cuba legally

as a joumnalist.

But, he stressed, he was not hostile to Williams and hoped

that he could establish himself in China and explain the situation in America

(it he had any idea what it now was) to the Chinese, who were indeed the

center of the world revolutionary movement. However, Mao's statement was

foolish when it referred to mity between black and white workers and he

(Boggs) would tell him so 11 he ever saw him.

13. The Detroit movement had to international ties yet. They had heard

from Bjorn Kum (reporter in Sweden for Altonbladet, an extreme left wing

socialist paper) who wanted material for an anthology on black power, and were

in contact with Quademi Piacentini in Italy, end soreone from Nouvel

Observateur, vriting a book on the Afro-Americen struggle, had also visited "

Detroit several times.

William Gardiner Smith had also promised to remain in

contact with them, Boggs said.

They also had an English-born ixiend,

Kathleen Aberle, now Ilving in Vancouver, Canada, who taught there and was

in contact with U.S. draft dodgers and others.

(Aberle lives at 4510 W. Marine

Drive, West Vancouver.) Boggs told Ion Kwon (phonetically), & Chinese wo

works at ford, that Aberle was visiting Detroit again In December, but was

staying at a hotel rather than with old friends with woom she no longer agreed

politically. Kvon had apparently worked with Boggs in the Correspondence and

preceding Irotskyist splinter groups, perhaps

with Aberle.

14. As for RAM, Bogss said that, frankly, many of 1ts members were

lunaties. He did not believe they were guilty of everything they had been

accused of, but they presented the easiest target in America for white

repression. Max Stanford had behaved badly with many people, especially

Milton Henry, to whom he had written an obscene letter.

And Paul' (last name

not known) was simply using the black novement to hustle money, Boggs said.

He was running a sort of protection raciet.

15. Boggs said he had been very cautious about Williams' feud with

the cubans and had not become involved in the dispute in nationalist circles

about Carlos Moore. He had not had enough facts to make a rational judgment,

buù he lnew from an Argentinian who had visited Detroit that Che Guevara was

NW 55509 DooId: 32339283

Page 44

---

## Page 45

alive six months ago. This Argentinian had actually seen Che somewhere in

South America and Boggs was certain the Argentinian was a rellable source.

16. Concerning international contacts, Boggs complained of the lack

of s review like the old Revolution and wondered if some sort of serious

colloquium on black power end racial discrimination could not be organized

abroad, elther in Jurope or A2r100.

17.

Boggs spole higaly of Daniel I. Watts and his magazine, Llberator.

He said he felt that Ilberator was read by the black people he wanted to

reach and he intended to write more frequently for the publication.

• Rev. Gleege would do so also, he said.

18g

In conclusion, he said the black novement in Detroit was in a

period of transition, but it had established solid bases for the eventual

seizure or trensfer of power in the city. In a matter of time, there would

be a black city administration, and this patter would be followed in many

other cities. Violence was necessary for self-defense against white racists

or to cut through the run-arounds and other

evasions of the white power.....

structure In seeking to avoid granting blacks the management of their ow.

afrairs in their cities, the homelends of the blacis nation within a nation

in America, Boggs emphasized.

CG 6548-S, however, concluded that GIBSON was

solely interested in pushing sales for a forthooming book

based on articles of ROBERT WILLIAMS.

(GIBSON mentioned more

than once that the Belgian Communist

publish this book and that he, GIBSON, was responsible for

the publication.)

Co 6548-S stated that their opinion of GIBSON

could heve been the result of: 1) the information brought back

from Europe last year by CG 5908-S to the effect that the

Italian pro-Communist group suspected GIBSON of being a CIA

agent and 2) GIBSON's repeated statements during this contact

that he had been suspected of being a CIA agent. CG 6548-8

felt that because GIBSON repeated this charge against him at

leust three times during their discussion that they felt that

this could have been the main and sole reason for his contact

the ARC, ego, to dispel the implication made by the

Italians that GIBSON Was an agont. The intornants advised

that they told GIBSON that as long as GRIPPA and RAINDORE

belleved the charge against hin was false then so too

does the

AHC believe there is no substance to such accusations

It should

be pointed out that both informants definitely

believe that GIBSON is a CIA agent and that his primary reason

for contacting the AUC was to dispel the suspicions of the Italians.

Informants added that GIBSON 1s a mooth operator, but that his

ideological understanding is very shallow and his manner of

approach scsuch that a

wonder just why he was being contacted by GIBSON:

that a true Marxist would be vitally interested in the recent

New Politics Convention and especially of an analysis of the

Black Pover forces within this convention,

but such was not the

case with GIBSON.

CG 6548-S stated that it was definitely her

impression that GIBSON did not mean one word he said nor did

he listen to any word that they said.

Hence, their conclusion.

These impressions of the informants

are set forth initially because

of the interest of the Bureau in this matter.

Because of these

statements

because of the status of GIBSON, the following

znformatzon, which relates to his contact with

morning and produced a statement of LaNs regarding the recently .

held New Politics Conference.

According to GIBSON, LENS was

worried that the tactics of Black Power at the convention would

backfire to the extent that the Government would crackdown on,

not only Black Pover groups, but all liberal-progrossive elements

GIBSON stated that he bad

been to Los Angeles, but

not San Francisco or Canada.

He related that he had talked to

someone in Watts (not identified) and also that Progressive

Labor Party (PLP) was

to attend. PLP classos.

With respect to PLE, the informant

stated that he had recently boen contacted by a former National

Conmittee (NC) menber of PLP who questioned the source of funds

of this organization and GIBSON replied that PLE does seem to

have a lot of money to pass around.

Fie was asked where he

thought PLP was

getting the money, but he did not answer the

question

With repect to PLP, GIBSON stated that this organiza-

tion has attacked China and the Belgians. When apprised of the

recent standing of PLe with respect to Soviet ald to Viet Nam

he stated that this was not unusual since PLP always has been

was still in the movement and operating in another country.

He stated that VAN AwOl Tas not expelled iron the movement,

bence the impression that the informote had from the Belgians

It was at this time that GIBSON mentioned that

he too had been expolled and the informants understood that the

country he was referring to was France. It was also at this

time that GIBSON brought up the fact that he had been accused

of being an agent of CIA by one of the Italian groups and that

even RAINDORE and CRIPPA had had sinilar charges against then.

Informants advised him that as long as he had the backing of

the Belgians he was okay with the ANC:

it was their impression that this could ill have been

to push the

sale of a book by ROBERT WILLIANS.

GIBSON related that he was

having this book published by the BCP and that it consists of h

selection of WILLIAMS' writings.

In connection with the dis

cussion on WILLIAMS, GIBSON mentioned that STOKELY CARMICHAEL

has been in China tuice. After CARMICHAEL's trip to Cuba
