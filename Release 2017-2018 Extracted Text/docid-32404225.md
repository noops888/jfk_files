MEMORANDUM FOR:

Director, Center for Studies in Intelligence

FROM:

Katherine M. Stricker, DO/ IRO

SUBJECT:

Discussion re Release of Form 362

REFERENCE:

HRG Memorandum, same subject, 6 November 1992

1. When the subject of the Name Trace Form 362

first came up in the JEK material, the do's position was that the

form is classified, reveals a DO method and must remain

classified, regardless of the name on the form being traced.

2. Now the denied in toto documents are

being reviewed, especially large categories

such as the Name

Trace Forms.

The DO has reconsidered and, in the interests of

cooperating with the HRG so that some words can appear on

the form, has proposed a modified position allowing for about 1/4

of the form to be released, again depending on the name being

traced.

Two HRG officers have indicated that that is

unsatisfactory and they want a "less heavy-handed" approach.

The reason the do is

so protective of this

form is that the it represents one of the most unique and

basic of all Do methods, the name trace. That we do name traces

is no secret; how we do them is.

The portion of the form the do

is prepared to release deals only with the title of the form and

the biographic data required to trace an individual.

All other

portions of the form which deal with what other offices are to be

checked and in what order, where the initials and date go, and

how to consolidate 201s are part of a pre-printed classified form

which cannot be released to the public. Methodology is the

wai chose a gy1e tea form

primary concern of the Do on this matter, but there is also the

question of fabrication should the entire form be released.

We

have been burned in the past by hostile services or corrupt

Americans using our forms for their own purposes--causing us

untold resources in righting the situation, where caught.

SUBJECT: Discussion re Release

of Form 362

4. It occurs to us that if the primary reason

for releasing part of the Form 362 is to eliminate blank pages,

then the goal of the HRG will be accomplished with our proposal.

We urge you to consider the remaining Do equities in this matter.
