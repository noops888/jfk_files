Investigation by I-2,

of known reliability, at the fore-

going address, disclosed that an individual who was known to the

building manager as JOHN MC CORMICK was a constant visitor at the

apartment of a French

"cabaret artist" named ODETT OLIVIER, who

had occupied Apartment 4, Calle Rio Hudson #7, for approximately

eighteen months until she moved from that address in April, 1954,

stating she planned to return to Europe.

T-2 was advised,

howevers

by the building manager that in early June, 1954, ODETT OLIVIER:

telephoned her inquiring

to whether or not any mail had arrived

at that address for her.

companions in a 1951 Oldsmobile or Pontiac automobile bearing

1953 San Salvador License Plates had assisted OLIVIER when she

moved from that address.

This source further advised that MC

CORMICK did not appear to be employed and that on several

casions he remained at the apartment continuously and claimed

he was awaiting long-distance telephone calls from Central

America.

Information was received independently from I-4,

of known reliability, inLApril, 1954,

to the effect that one

EDWARD SABATINO had been spending considerable time in the

company df ROSENDO ARGUELLO, IR., and that in the latter part

of April ARGUELLO and SABATINO had departed from Mexico City

for Guatemala in the automobile of ARGUELLO, which was described

as a 1951 Buick bearing 1953 San Salvador License Plates.

had also advised that SABATINO claimed to be a former U. S. Air

Force pilot who is presently in the business of buying and selling

U. S. Army surplus and to have delivered a substantial quantity

of arms to associates of deposed Cuban President CARLOS PRIO

SOCARRAS.

I-4 stated SABATINO claimed that the agent who handled

the matter for PRIO SOCARRAS had paid him for the arms in United

States currency.

approximately one-half of which turned out to be

fraudulent®
