the place and ANDY MANGINI is out altogether.

FRANK CONSTANZA, from Arnold, Pa., works on the

ipstairs door and also does clean-up work after the place

pushes in, and the upstairs door pulls out.

Some of the dealers at the tables are MICKEY OUTLAW,

the TMA Club, New Kensington, Pa., by MIKE "BEN" NAMEY.

Three

of the dealers who are there working every day are ANDY MANGINI,

DANIEL "SPEEDO"; HANNA and SONNY CIANCUTTI.

Lo-Ball is a card game similar toppoker, but it is

played backwards.

In other words, the low hand wins insteac

of the high hand.

On August 8, 1967, PG T-T advised:

He heard the "KELLY" MANNARINO group was interested

in a casino in the Caribbean but he does not know if they are

interested in GIL BECKLEY's casino in Antigua, British West

Indies.

BECKLEY, however, intends on giving this casinow

since he is losing money.

On September 14, 1967, PG T-3 advised:

KELLY MANNARINO receives $100 per week as his share

for permitting the operation of card games at the IMA Club,

New Kensington, Pa.

F. POLICE AND POLITICAL INFLUENCE

On August 23, 1967, PG I-2 advised:

Last week, Detective FRAM

LINK. New Kensington Police

Department, said that "the old man,

means KELLY) had flown

south and that LINKand the Chief of Police of New Kensington

Police Department are going to meet KELLY at Palm Beach, Fla.

LINK then advised that he needed money for the trip and

the

informant gave him $100 because informant feared a physical

beating from Detective LINK.

A day or so after he had had a

meeting with LINK, he saw KELLY MANNARINO from a distance in

New Kensington, Pa.,

and on August 22, 1967, he saw LINK talking

to KELLY in New Kensington, Pa.

There is a conflict between KELLY and the Mayor of

New Kensington due to the fact that the Mayor will not bend to

KELLY's wishes and LINK was placed in his present position at

the New Kensington Police Department to keep an eye on the Mayor.

advised he had been

unable to ascertain name of contact

by JOSEPH "RED" GIORDANO,

"o-between"

man for the MANNARINO

coming up for bid on an Indian Reservation, somewhere in

the State of Arkansas, and GIORDANO advised informant that

he ron be

million dollars, and after he has had a chance to study the

plans and before making his bid, Unknown Subject,

employed

by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, is allegedly coming to

Youngstown at which time he will discuss the job with

informant.

CV.646-C advised that GIORDANO is the "go-between"

between he and the MANNARINO brothers, and also between

the MANNARINO brothers and Unknown subject, employed by the

CV 646-C stated that GiTORDANO continues to frequent

the Town and Country Motel, with restaurant and bar, Route

The Warren City and Telephone Directories and

the Haines Youngstown-Warren City and Suburban addressakey-

telokey directory failed to list either the name of ARTHUR

MaRAs or the address of 2620 Risher, S. W., Warren.

sensitive information, and it would still appear that no

active inquiry be made in Washington so that the informant

will not be placed in a compromising position.., Continued

contacts will be made with the informant, and when positive

information is developed, all interested offices wiil be

advised.
