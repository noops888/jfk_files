Dear Mr. Fauntroy:

Thank you for your letter of i8 May 1977 relating to the

journalists covering the work of the House Select Committee on

Assassinations.

I endorse your conviction that a free press is essential

to a free and democratic society.

In keeping with that, let me

reassure you that no U.S. journalist is employed by the Central

Intelligence Agency.

You suggest that I should contact the editors of journalists

covering your Committee who may have been associated with this

Agency in the past. My predecessors have established a policy

of not disclosing the names of persons who have cooperated with

us. I am enclosing a copy of the Agency statement on the subject.

I support that policy and will adhere to it. It any journalists

on the list you refer to had had previous relations with this

Agency, to notify their editors would be a violation of this

policy. I hope you will understand our position on this matter.

Yours sincerely,

Is/ Stansfield Iurner

STATEMENT

Over the years, the CIA has had relationships with

individuals in many walks of American life. These

relationships, many of a voluntary and unpaid nature, have

reflected the desire of Americans to help their country.

Such relationships have been conducted by the Agency with.

the clear intent of furthering its foreign intelligence

mission and have not been aimed at influencing or improperly

acting on any American institution.

Genuine concern has recently been expressed about CIA

relations with newsmen and churchmen. The Agency does not

believe there has been any impropriety on its part. in the

limited use made of persons connected in some way with

American media, church and missionary organizations.

Nonetheless, CIA recognizes the special status afforded

these institutions under our Constitution and in order to

avoid any appearance of improper use by the Agency, the

HH 53217 DocId:32403785 Page 3

DCI has decided on a revised policy to govern Agency

relations with these groups:

- Effective immediately, CIA will not enter into

any paid or contractual relationship with any

full-time or part-time news correspondent

accredited by any U.S. news service, newspaper,

periodical, radio or television network or station.

-- As soon as feasible, the Agency will bring

existing relationships.with individuals in these

groups

into conformity with this new policy.

-- CIA has no secret paid or contractual relationship

with any American clergyman or missionary. This

practice will be continued

as a matter of policy.

CIA recognizes that members of these groups may wish

to provide information to the CIA on matters of foreign.

intelligence of interest to the U.S. Government. The CIA

will continue to welcome information volunteered by such

individuals.

It is Agency policy not to divulge the names of

cooperating Americans. In this regard CIA will not make

public, now or in the future, the names of any cooperating

journalists or churchmen.

Dear Admiral Turner:

Thank you for your kind letter of May 10, 1977, in

response to my letter of April 25, 1977. It is reassuring to

know that you share the view of former CIA Director William

Colby that the now discontinued practice of the CIA employing

journalists as undercover contacts, compromises the integrity

of the free press in America and that you will not allow it in

your administration either.

A free press, in my view, is essential to a free and

democratic society. The despicable practice in totalitarian

countries of employing government controlled journalists is as

abhorrent to me as it is to the American Society of Newspaper

Editors.

Pursuant to your kind offer of complete cooperation,

may I ask you to inspect the list containing the names of forty

journalists, to which Mr. Colby referred, and, if you find among

the names journalists or feature writers who are presently covering

the work of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, inform

the appropriate editors of your findings. It would be appropriate, it

seems to me, for you to encourage those editors to relieve such

journalists from their assignments related to the assassination probes.

I have no need to know the names of those on the list; I need only to

be assured that those who served the CIA during and after the period

under investigation by our Committee are not reporting or interpreting

the activities of the Committee to the American public today.

HENORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Conversations with Oswald Johnster (26 Noveber 1973)

and Lavid ErasLow (Z9 Novenber 1973), Washington Star

1.

I spoke to Nr. Johnston

to follow up ay talk with Mr.

Newbold Noyes on 15 Novenber 1973.

Mr. Johnston said Mr. Noyes

had asked hin to come over to continue the discussion.

reiterated that I had visited Mr. Noyes to clarify a possible

misapprehension in our luncheon of 27 Septeaber 1973. I

essentially repeated nuch of what I had said to Mr. Noyes.

then discussed the natter somewhat more at length and I gave

ball parl figures of various categories of journulists with whom

we had contact. (a)

- Staff journalists, (b) stringers or free

lance, and (c) casual contacts.

I pointed out that the staff

jourualists of significant journals were a very small nuuber

(3-5), plus peraaps 3-5 additional whose use had been approved

by the managerent. I said there was an additional 10 or so with

journals such as trade or industry journals of general utilization.

I said that the total free lance stringers with whon we had

varying degrees of association was in the area of 40. I said

that we are in the course of terminating our relatiouship

with the staff journalists category for significant publications.

I said that uny addizional use of the ocher categories rould be

under high stringent control at the beputy Director level.

2. It became obvious that ir. Johnston was building toward

a stoxy.

As a result, I teiephoned to Nr. Hewbold Noyes hoping

to dissuade him fron such a story. Mr. Noyes was iT the hospital

and I eventually ended up with lit. Erasion. To Mir. Erasiow i

indicated that I was not concerned about myself of CIA being

in any problen because of such

= story but that I was concerned

over

a possible acverse ispact

on a substantial nunber of innocent

individuals around the world who would be suspect and possibly

abused by unfriendly local governments. I then said that I

believed that Mr. Kraslow has a very serious responsibility to

detemine whether the value of the story warranted the harm it

could do to suci innocent people, although I, of course,

recognized

that he had every right to publish it. In the course of this

NW 53217 DooId: 32403785

Page 16

---

## Page 17

...

conversation, I corrected the figures given above to the

following:

(a) Three staff journalists actively used by CIA,

(b)

two staff journalists used by CIA known to their management,

(c) eight staff menbers of trade or sinilar journals of minor

significance, not necessarily known to managerent, (d) 25

stringers of free lancers used in varying degree by CIA, running

from fuli use to occasional support payments.

A final category

was mentioned of normal contacts for exchange of infornation

and viows but without any financial support, as to whose number

I had no idea. I said that the one individual whose name had

come up as associated with the Star was in the last category

and that we had his name nerely because we had to give our own

people the source of the infornation ke had obtained from him

fion tine to time is our exchange of views. Ni. Kraslow

indicated that he would probably be running a story and I stressed

that I had undertaken these talks kith him on sy original ground

rules, i.e, the information is theirs but no sourcing to myself

or CIA. MI. Kraslow said

that they wanted to run a favorable

account of our intentions

re journalists (flattery will get you

lots of places), but I reiterated my concern that any such article

could only do harn io innocent individuals not on our lists. He

indicated that his persoual view was that we should stay away

fron all categories; I commented over the negative aspects of

being barred fron the Peace Corps, Fulbrighters, USIA, USAID

soon, etc., etc., which drew little sympathy.

He tried to talk

about future infornal association with he but I reacted rather

cooly to this idea.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

THROUGH

FROM

REFERENCE

: Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

: Herbert E. Hetu

Assistant to the Director (Public Affairs)

: Rep. Fauntroy's Letter of 25 April 1977

In connection with the clippings forwarded by

Mr. Fauntroy, we are attaching a memorandum of 4 December

1973 which explains how the information concerning journalists

affiliated at that time with the Agency became public. The

memorandum, signed by Mr. Colby, also outlines the attempts

by Mr. Colby to get the Star to defer publication of the in-

formation.

DDO in fact has a list of 51 persons which was

prepared for Mr. Colby, dated 16 October 1973. These include

employees, agents, and collaborators.

In, Mr. Fauntroy's letter he makes it clear that he

is not referring to any relationships of the Agency today

and expresses his confidence that you will not permit a

recurrence of past "misdeeds."

His concern is about "the

past relationship of certain journalists to the CIA," which

seems to indicate he is concerned about some lingering loyalty

on contacts.

20505

Dear Admiral Turner:

I am in receipt of your letter regarding recent media

reports about statements made by me concerning the House

Assassinations Committee and the role of certain journalists.

I wish to make clear that my statements did not refer, and were

not intended to refer, to the present Central Intelligence Agency.

I do consider it noteworthy, however, that on November 30,

1973,

the Washington Star-News reported that the CIA employed

some forty journalists who doubled as undercover contacts (see

article enclosed herewith). Further, on December 1, 1973, tha

Washington Post carried a similar article, which is also enclosed.

It is also noteworthy that one of the journalists named in these

reports is covering the assassinations probe for one of our most

widely read newspapers. While I am a strong supporter and advocate

of hard, factual news coverage, I am concerned that some of the news

reports have been unfair and without bases. Some of the reports, it

seems, have been designed to discourage the probe by the House. I

simply want to be certain that there is no connection between the

I believe you will agree that it is a sad and dangerous

commentary on our news delivery system if those charged with

informing the public have personal interests at stake.

I am hopeful that this letter is responsive to the

concerns expressed in your letter.. I feel confident that you are

doing an excellent job and that past misdeeds by the CIA will not

be repeated under your able leadership.

If you have further inquiries, please feel free to contact

me.

Dear Senator Moynihan,

Thank you for bringing my attention yesterday to the article

about Delegate Fauntroy.

I am sorry that I had not read it. I

have done so since and enclose a copy of my immediate reaction

to it.

I must say, in all candor, that I was not unduly alarmed

upon reading it.

Perhaps I have just become inured to the almost

daily accusations in our press that the ClAis at the bottom of

all manner of ills.

I would also say that if Delegate Fauntroy has serious suspicions

that members of the media are subverting his investigation, I believe

happy to support him with full information on the role of the CIA in

the past and today.

I do not believe that any segment of our society,

even the media, should be privyleged to stand above legitimate legis-

lative inquiry.

In our conversation yesterday, I failed to thank you for your

significant and helpful contribution to the discussions at our hearing
