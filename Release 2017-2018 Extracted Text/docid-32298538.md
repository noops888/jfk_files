with them.

In return, G-2 was ready to support MARQUEZ and

assist him in furthering his education, MARQUEZ was told to

think things over while keeping up the reporting on their

activities.

EDUARDO showed MARQUEZ a list containing names

of his relatives and friends plus a large number of individuals
