Eatinger's notes (attached) :

4 May 1964 - since we are treating "anti-Castro" activities

25 Sept 1975 - The New Orleans mail intercept operation was

of interest to the HSCA investigation and has been mentioned

in our files.

The item refers to the Senate Select

Committee and it is doubtful if it is JFK related. Eatinger

says it is our call.

26 July 1978 (memo for the Record) - Eatinger was not

comfortable with our deletion I ]; he has originally

proposed to release.

I recommended that we at least delete

the word prison.

There may not have been many women in

prison with that background.

President Kennedy's assassination will appear in the 14 November Wash-

Bolten called attention to today's Washington Post article about

David Wise's book (attached) and stated his belief that it contains details

which were not included in the Senate's published report. It was agreed

that this material was deleted from the Senäte report and that Wise's

Laccount is correct, In response to the DDCI's query, Bolten stated that

we had not had prior word of the Wise book.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

Staff Meeting Minutes of 26 July 1978

The Director was on leave; Mr. Carlucci was testifying on the Hill;

Mr. Blake chaired the meeting.

Mr. Blake asked Hetu to explain the disturbing ABC story emanating

from Havana.

Hetu said that ABC reporter Reynolds called him and said

that as part of Cuba's 26 July celebration, a double agent will march in

a parade and appear at a press conference, saying that CIA tried to prove

that Cubans were involved in President Kennedy's assassination. Castro

also plans to announce CIA activities in Africa to track the Cuban presence

there. Hetu told Reynolds that he hesitated to comment at the present time

but the charge regarding the Kennedy assassination was ridiculous.

McMahon summarized an FBI report that a Cuban Intelligence Service

official has been

in contact with an unidentified journalist in connection

with the world Youth Festival now taking place in Cuba.

The journalist

stated that the festival will include a tribunal that will condemn CIA.

activities throughout the world. It will also reveal the above-mentioned

charge that the CIA tried to prove Cuban involvement in President Kennedy's

assassination.

Former CIA agents will be revealed as well as proof of CIn

activities in Africa. This report also mentioned that a press conference

will be held.

Greaney (lor oce) added that on 21 July an obe representative pala

off a former agent in New York who had been in prison in Cuba. She had

been a member of the original 26th of July Movement and seemed to have

become extremely radical and bitter.

Greaney said that he would not be

surprised if this individual appeared at any of the above-mentioned

activities.

The reference to Wise's book would constitute "official
