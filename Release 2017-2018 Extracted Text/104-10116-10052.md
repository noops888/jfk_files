03

gave a copy to the Seattle FBI Office.

A copy of the digest was also

given to Mr.

CIA O/S, Seattle Resident Agent. A copy

of the digest is attached. Seattle FBI Office said that they probably

will not take any action but would pass the information along to their

In all probability the information

ment Officer, Seattle University, to determine if he had heard anything

about the subject matter on the campus.

Colonel Dolan works with Mr.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Call from Mr8. Margaret Fanning Regarding Anti-CIA Activity

at the University of Seattle

1.

On 18 January 1968, 1100 hours; the Denver Office received a

call on the listed number from a woman who identified herself as

Mrs. Margaret Fanning.

Mrs. Fanning stated that she lives in Pueblo

and that at the time of the call she was at Stapleton Airport enroute

to Texas.

Mrs. Fanning's reason for calling us was her great concern

about what her daughter, Clare, Is being taught about the CIA and the

Kennedy assassination at the University of Seattle where Clare 18 a

student.

Mrs. Fanning has

received

several telephone calls recently

from Clare in which Clare

Informed her mother that some of the priests

at the University of Seattle (a Jesuit school) had convinced the students

that Garrison's theories about the assassination are correct and that the

charges about the Agency's implication are also correct.

3.

Mrs. Fanning stated that her daughter 1s actually afraid of the

CIA and considers that the CIA is comparable to the Gestapo. Mrs. Fanning

stated that she tried to persuade Clare that what she (the daughter) had

heard is totally untrue but Mrs. Fanning had no success whatsoever in

changing her daughter'e viewpoint.

4. Mrs. Fanning also stated that Clare asked her to be sure not

to repeat to anyone any of the foregoing information and that the priests

,at Seattle University had instructed their students not to discuss these

matters with their parents.

Mrs. Fanning was obviously most upset that

a faculty member at a university, particularly a priest, had instructed

students not to discuss matters presented to them at the school with their

_parents:

In this connection, I suggested to Mrg. Fanning that she possibly

had legitimate grievance against the school and that she might write a

letter to the president on this particular item.

5. I also pointed out to her that if there is in progress at the

University of Seattle activity which could be construed as a threat to

the US Internal security, the FBI would be Interested.

I expressed

appreciation for Mrs. Fanning'& concern about the misinformation on the

CIA which is apparently being disseminated at the University of Seattle

but pointed out that there 18 very little we can do about such matters.
