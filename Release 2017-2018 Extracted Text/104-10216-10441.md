His merory functions well, and he scems to have ac-

cumulated a rather diversified store of knowledge and infornation.

The writer is not a born organizer, but he tries to arrange his

affairs properly and to be as systenatic and rethodical as possible, in

order to avoid confusion. He is active and versatile aud can make sudd

word and script. Fe has sone skill in adjusting his style

to that of the people he is talking to.

Wrile he can be rather elo-

secret. He has some intuition and also sensitivity for selecting and

he poseesses manual skill which he could exploit in different ways.

while he has leurned to figure and calculate, this activity does

seem to hold his interest.

levertheless, he is concurned with money.

He is rather

free in spending it and may not always set along with

the means at his diegosal. In his selected profescional field, he

should be a 500d student who

He is very self-

He is very secretive about his affairs

There is little
