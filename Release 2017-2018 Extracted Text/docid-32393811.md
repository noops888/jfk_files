(7) . Was dissemination made on this reporting to CI Staff?

'Since CI Staff held the Agency's official file on

OSWALD, all cable traffic (theoretically) including dissemina-

tions by cable was sent to the Staff for filing in the official

file. Additionally, cables disseminations were released by

CI/Liaison.

Copies were, therefore, available to the Staff.

Since CI Staff released all long-form CSCI's, coordina-

ted on short-form CSCI's, and maintained the CSCI 1og, the CI

Staff received copies of all CSCI's.

See attached list of all (presently available) dissemi-

hations to the Intelligence Community. Copies were available to

CI Staff.
