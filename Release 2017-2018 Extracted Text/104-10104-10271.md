Federal and State requirements as follows:

1)

Corporation Federal Income Tax Returns.

2)

Federal Withholding and Unemployment Taxes.

3) Florida State Unemployment Tax.

4)

Florida Corporation Report and Tax Return.

5) Florida Intangible Property Tax Return.

G. AGENT IDENTIFICATION: The Corporation was providing status cover

and payrolling for 10 Cubans as of 31 January

1967.

11.

ASSESSMENT OF VULNERABILITY:

1.

Maritime Branch Assessment dated 6 March 1967:

This cover company should be affected little by

a flap.

However, because of the berthing location

within largely tourist or recreation areas, its

commercial activity has been noted.

2.

Cover Branch Assessment dated 6 March 1967:

A successor to Ace Cartography Company, Ace Marine

Survey, Inc., is currently used in connection with

the leasing

of a waterfront berthing site for the

oerthing of M/V SONORA, which is registered under

this firm. The firm also provides cover and serves

as well

as the vehicle for payrolling the agent crew.

Ace Marine Survey, Inc., is engaged in the field of

marine research, including the study of marine life

as well as the testing of marine equipment.

In view of the current limited use of this cover,

the likelihood of exposure is considerably reduced.

However, if such an exposure did occur, it is felt

that the

damage to either WOFACT or the officers

of Ace Marine Survey, Inc., would be of no great

import.

The major likely

'injury" that would be

sustained would be the denial of further use of the

berthing site and the need for re-naming/re-register-

In order to add depth and lend further substance

to the cover story, the officers of a legitimate 2y

firm, _

Louisiana, which is engaged in marine research

and

off-shore oil exploration activities,

have agreed

to backstop the activities of Ace Marine Survey, Inc.

and

to recognize the latter firm as a client.

ISSESSMENT OF VULNERABILITY:

1. Maritime Branch

Assessment dated 6 March 1967 - The cover

mechanism established by the Ceres Enterprises, Inc. was very

secure during the period of its operation and remained so

until the loss of one of its agents who was captured in Cuba.

This made it necessary to terminate the activities of this

corporation and transfer its activities to another entity.

This was accomplished without any unusual events or actual

public exposure.

If any

should occur at this late date, the

damage would be minimal.

2.

Cover Branch Assessment dated 6 March 1967 - This corporation

is currently inactive and will become legally dormant after

three years.

It was placed in this status due to an operational

Ilap which could have exposed the corporation.

tax return was filed at the tax year ending March 31, 1966.

An additional tax return will be filed for the past tax year

which will indicate no financial transactions.

Its assets and activities were transferred to other JMWAVE

entities.

This corporation was established to provide cover

for a Maritime Branch vessel and status and payroll cover for

the agents assigned to it.

The corporation is inactive and

will be allowed to remain so.

It was placed in this status

due to a flap wherein an agent was captured in Cuba who had

knowledge of this vessel

and its ownership. There was no

public exposure in the Miami area.

However, because of the

past incident the corporation should not be used in the future

under its current name.

While in use the corporation served

very satisfactorily for the purpose for which it was established.
