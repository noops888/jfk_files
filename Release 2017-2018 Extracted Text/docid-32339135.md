on 9/30/64 former LA 3402-s who has furnished

reliable information in the past and who desired her

identity be maintained in confidence orally advised that

she had learned earlier in the day that Mr. LAWSON is

leaving for New York on October 1, and will be gone for

approximately six to eight weeks

and will return late in

November.

LAWSON indicated that he will "Be speaking at

a lot of

meetings

and taking care of business while in

the New York area"

LAWSON discussed the recently released Warren

report regarding the assassination of President KENNEDY.

LAWSON feels this report "Is a complete whitewash" and that

Warren "Has

been silenced by the powers that be"

LAWSON

also indicated that he feels the question concerning

any alleged pay to OSWALD by

the

central Intelligence

Agency has not beenresolved.

Informant got the impression that some of LAWSON's

speeches in the New York area might be

describing these

feelings concerning the Warren report
