Title: JEK TASK FORCE (JERTE)

Synopsis: Request facsimile machine for use on the JFKTF.

Details: The JFKTF is requesting the possession of a facsimile

machine for use by the JFKTF.

The nature of the JFKTE's work requires hourly facsimile

contact with the Butte Information Technology Center (BITC),

as

well

as daily contact with other FBI Field Offices.

The use of a

Facsimile machine is for both incoming and outgoing faxes, the

latter

of which can be quite sizable, thus

monopololizing

machine.
