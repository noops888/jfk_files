Dear Mr. Chairman:

GIFK

"JEKARCA of 1992

I am writing on behalf of Director Louis J. Freeh to

inform you of the status of the FBI's response to the "president

John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992"

(the Act), and to provide projections regarding completion of the

work that remains to be done pursuant to the Act.

This letter

reiterates much of the information conveyed to Ms. Diane Merritt

of the staff of the Regulation and Government Information

Subcommittee (RGIS) by FBI JFK Task Force Director Terry T.

o'Connor in a meeting on June 16, 1994, and a telephone

conversation on June 20, 1994.

The FBI has been committed to a speedy and full

response to the Act and, to date, has transferred 463,395 pages

of JFK documents to the National Archives and Records

Administration (NARA). This represents almost half of the nearly

one million pages of

assassination-related documents that the

Task Force can now estimate have been in FBI files. The files

that have been transferred include all Lee Harvey Oswald, Jack

Ruby, "related subjects" (e.g. Marina Oswald), and Warren

Commission files, as well

President Kennedy's Assassination that were maintained at FBI

Headquarters and in the FBI's Dallas and New Orleans Field

offices.
