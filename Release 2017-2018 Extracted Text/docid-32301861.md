JFK Act 6(4)

ADKINISTRATIVE

On 1/31/62, PCIL

advised that

the Alcohol Beverage Control (ABC), Department of the State

of New Jersey, is insisting that all members of the teamsters

unions complete a questionnaire which in part pertains to

their criminal background 1f any.

In cases where a teamster

member has been arrested, he 1s required to set forth on

this questionnaire the date of his arrest, the charge,

and the disposition, plus & photograph for the files of the

ABC. As a result of the ABC's insistence that this

questionnaire be completed in its entirety, ANTHONY

PROVENZANO ordered JACOB FRIEDLAND, attorney for Teamsters

Joint Council 73, to fight this Issue in the courts if

necessary in order to prevent the disclosure of any teamster's

background.

related that as a result of this request

by ABC, PROVENZANO

had a meno prepared and distributed

teamsters within the state of New Jersey, which

informed the membership that this order by the ABC was

illegal and that the membership was not required to complete

the portion of the questionnaire which pertained to the

criminal background.

PCI L

Jadvised further that

this nemo instructed the membership to immediately report

any situation where the management of a particular firm

Insisted that this be completed.. This was to have

been immediately reported to PROVENZANO's office but

under no circumstances were the members to complete it

if they did not

desire to.

PCI stated that JACOB FRIEDLAND'S SON, DAVID,

•young attorney, who recently joined his father's

practice, was understood to have been responsible for the

research

into the legal precedence on this matter.

Istated that the recent arrest of

SALVATORE BRIGUGLIO, NUNZIO PROVENZANO, and EUSTICE ROPER

by the New York City Police Department has not been dig

cussed by any of the officials of Local 560 to date.:

pes stated that the fact that they have not discussed

this matter indicates that the lesser known figure of

these three; namely, robai, mil in all probablaaty.

be ordered to admit the extortion and thereby exonerate

PROVENZANO's brother, NUNZIO, and BRIGUGLIO.

At that point,

ADMINISTRATIVE

On 3/28/62, PCI L

was recontacted, at which

time he advised that approximately one month ago he attended

& Local 560 Board of Trustees' meeting in the offices of

the local's attorney, Mr. JACOB FRIEDLAND. He stated that

during the course of this meeting, FRIEDLAND announced

that the loan of $275, 000 of Welfare Fund money, which was

to have been made arailable to the owners of the Pine Brook

Auction, Route 46, Pine Brook, New Jersey, had fallen

through In that it had been determined by FRIEDLAND that

the owner of this establishment had committed suicide.

stated that although he has been unable

to determine the

identities of the individuals who are

to receive a $200,000.00 loan for the renovation of their

New Jersey, he has received information indicating that

this business firm is oned by two brothers of Italian

extraction who reside in the North Hudson County area.

advised that PROVENZANO has apparently issued

orders

to his business agents and organizors to be more

discreet in their dealings with employers as conversation

in the trucking industry indicates that very few employers

are at this time

having difficulty with the enforcement

of the area wide contract.

stated that this is a

result of the adverse publicity which PROVENZANO has re

ceived in local neuspapers of late and believes this

period of relative peace will continue at least through

the period in wich his ow litigation is pending.

trucking

stated that inquiries by the FBI at

terminals through the netropolita. Newark

ares have also alerted the business agents, stewards,

and organizors; and, therefore, they are being very

circumspect in

their dealings with the employers and

teamster members.

stated that he wild attempt to dis

creetly obtain the identities of the owers of the

bowling alley establishment to whon PROVENZANO is making

available $200, 000 of Local 560 Welfare Fund money..

ADHINISTRATIVE

On 2/8/62, PCI

was contacted,

at which time he advised

that several matters

had been

brought to his attention concerning the activities of

Local 560 which he thought worthy of mention.

He explained

that since the inception of 560's Welfare and Pension

Programs, the Passaid-Bergen Counties Fund has operated at

a profit, whereas the Hudson County Fund has had deficits

periodically. PCI explained that even though this fact

1s easily proven by the annual audits, Local 560's attorney,

JACOB FRIEDLAND, attended the last Board of Trustees

meeting which was held just prior to Christmas (1961) and

demanded that the PassaiC-Bergen Board of Trustees

is a Bosid member) raise the employer contribution rate

from $. 31 per hour to the Hudson County rate of $.33 per

hour.

stated that he was vacationing in Florida

at the time of this meeting, however, learned on return

that the other two employer

trustees, ALBERT SCALETTI and

ALBERT

MARCHINI, voted against the proposal of FrIEDLaNd.

learned that FRIEDLAND explained to the Board that'

the S.02 differential between the Hudson and the Passaic®

Bergen Fund had created suspicion among the Hudson County

Terminal owners and investigative agencies and felt that

both funds should therefore immedistely establish the same

identical contributory rates.

stated that the second problem brought

before the Trustees has been FRIEDLAND's Insistance that

the employers of

ald 560 members contribute the $ 33 per

hour Welfare and Pension rate for all casual help regard.

dess of whether the individuads are members of 560, The

PCI explained that in the majority of cases where a

terminal requires additional man power, generally in

Passaic and Bergen Counties, the union is mable to supply

the men needed. When this occurs, he and other terminal

operators have an available supply of labor which wit

work their regular employment and thereafter join the

night or early norning shifts at the particular terminad

In need of man power.

He related that in almost ald cases

when this type of labor is

BAred, ELE

men are members of unions

other than 560. FRIEDLAND's Insistance that the trucking

operators contribute S.33 an hour for nor-Teamster help

which is hired, 1s not

only suspicious but unjustified.

He stated that when the employer members of the

Board of Trustees refused to vote in favor of these two

proposals by FRIEDLAND, FrIEDLANd demanded that they bring

the matters before the

New Jersey State Board of Mediation,

1100 Raywond Boulevard, Newark, New Jersey.

thereafter produced a copy of State Mediator's THOMAS A.

KNOWLTON's decision and award in both of the above proposals.

Both questions, namely, increasing the Passaid Bergen

truckers contribution to s.33 per hour and the contribution

of $. 33 to 560's Welfare and Pension Fund for non-union

mei,

was adjudicated in favor of the union, both effective

as of 2/4/62.

stated that he and all other trucking

employers

with

whom he has been in contact since this

decision was reached by KIOHLTON, are outraged for several

reasons:

first, why should the Passaid-Bergen operators

be forced to increase their rates

frow S. 31 tO $. 33

per hour when their fund issolvent and Hudson County'&

Fund which receives $ 33 per hour is running into deficit;

second, why should the employers in Passaic and Bergen

Countles contribute Welfare and Pension monies to 560

treatment and pension, rights under 560's contract.

PCI stated that he is of the opinion that state

Mediator THOMAS A.

KNOWLTON has been "bought" by PROVENZANO

in order to have rendered a decision in the union's favor.

related that the sext matter brought to

his attention involves the loans of $200,000.00 and

$275,000.00 by Local 560°g Welfare Fund to two separate

business firms within the past three months.

PCI explained that one SEYHOUR PASKOW, a Newarks

realtor, approached the PassaiC-Bergen County Board of

Trustees and informed them that he had learned that Local

was making available funds for mortgages. PASKOW stated

that he then had two clients in need ofvorking capital and

thereafter presented to the Board a picture of his clients'

net worth, including bills, rent, and potential.

stated that on the approval of the trustees

of the

Passaic and Bergen Countles Fund and PROVENZANO,

PASKOW

was furnished checks in the amount of $200,000.00 and

$275,000.00.

related that the loan of $200,000 at 6 per

cent interest for an unrecalled number of years went to two

brothers,. the names of whom he could not recadd who own a

bowling alley located in New Brunswick, New Jersey.

This

loan was ostensibly. for improvements of their aldeys.

The sun of $275,000 at 6 per cent for fifteen years

was furnished the owners of the Pine Brook Auction, Route 46,

Pine Brook, New Jersey.

stated that this group

placed their building and 12 acres of land up as collateral

for this doan.

Pol advised that he possesses no derogatory

information concerning PASKOW Of the Liras he represented

In these negotiations; however, he thought this information

worthy of mention.

_did state, however,

that&

possibility exists that PROVENZANO and others in the

Teamsters Union who would finally authorize these loans

could be receiving a percentage of the mortgage money

for having placed their stamp of approval on these

watters.

It should be noted that in the other case where the PCI

made available information concerning & $400, 000 Loan by

560 to the United States Glass and Chemical Company of

Pittsburgh and New York, an investigation revealed that

by the Securities Exchange Commission.

that this firm had changed its name to United states
