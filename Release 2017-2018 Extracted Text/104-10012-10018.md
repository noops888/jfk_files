SUBJECT:

James GARRISON

1. RI: Tracing continuing.

2. The following additional information has been obtained since

reference:

a.

The New Orleans States-Item of 3 March 1967 stated that

New York radio station WINS said that it had learned from reliable

sources that GARRISON believes that President Kennedy was

assassinated by "a group of plotters directed from Cuba." WINS

reporter Doug Edelson said that the source has access to GARRISON's

files and that, according to the files, "after an abortive CIA invasion

of Cuba, Castro put out an execution order on the President. "

b. A memorandum of l May 1967 by Mr. Richard H.

Lansdale, Associate General Counsel, advises that GARRISON

"Intends to demand that CIA furnish him with the photograph of Oswald

eptering or exiting the Mexico City Embasay, "

c.

James Phelan is the author of the lead article in the

Saturday Evening Post of 6 May 1967, beaded "A Plot to Kill Kennedy?

Rush to Judgment in New Orleans''. The following key points chiefly

concera GARRISON:

(1) Phelan knew GARRISON in 1963, when he spent

ten days with bim, obtaining material for a laudatory piece

called, "The Vice Man Cometh"'.

(2)

GARRISON and Phelan met in Las Vegas on 5 and

6 Maren 1967, and Phelan conducted ten hours of interviews.

GARRISON gave Phelan a memorandum of an interview con-

ducted with Perry RUSSO by Andrew J. SCIAMBRA, "a 31-yeaI-

old assistant D.A. just a year out of law school" who interviewed

RUSSO for three hours and took copious notes. GARRISON also

gave Phelan a transcript of what RUSSO said four days later, on

1 March 1967, while under hypnosis. The SCIAMBRA report

rade no mention si a plot among OSWALD, TERRIE, and

SHIAW So kill anyone. The 3, 5uJ-word roport also made no

reierence to a party at FRRIE's apartment. it did not

contain a positive identification oi Lee Harvey OSWALD as

"Leon" OSWALD. Shown a picture of Clay SHAW, RUSSO had

not identified him as 'BERTRAND". The SCIAMSRA Ieport

speciried that RUSSO had seen SHAW only twice. It did not

say that SHAW knew OSWALD.

(3) On 27 February 1967, according to a second

SCIAMBRA report, RUSSO was given sodium pentothal and

then did make passing reference to the party at which the

plot was discused", but did so only aiter prompting by

SCIAMBRA, who wrote, "I then asked him if he could remem-

ber any of the details about Clay Bertrand beinz up in FERRIE's

apartment. "

(4) Iwo days later DI. Esiond FATTER placed

RUSSO under hypnosis (he did so three times in all). When

RUSSO made no mention of a party or plot, FATTER directed

him to see "a picture of FERRIE's apartment and there are

several people in there and there is a white-haired man. Tell

me about it. " RUSSO complied but made no mention of SHAW,

"BERTRAND", or a plot. FATTER then ordered him to see

this picture: "There will be Bertrand, Ferrie and Oswald and

they are going to discuss a very important matter and there is

another man and girl there and they are talking about assassina-

ting somebody. Look at it and describe it to me." RUSSO

then told the atory that be subsequently gave in testimony.

(5) Phelan advised GARRISON of the profound differences

between the first SCIAMBRA report and the eventual RUSSO

testimony, GARRISON permitted Phelan to question SCIAMBRA

directly, in GARRISON's presence. SCIAMBRA said that he

must have forgotten to include the party and its participants.

When Phelan suggested consulting his original notes, SCIAMBRA

said that he had burned them.

Phelan asked Dr. FATTER

where he got the information used in questioning RUSSO under

hypnosis, and FATTER said it came from GARRISON's office.

Gordon Duane NOVEL

Inclosure 20

1. RI - No record.

2. The following additional information has been obtained since

the date of reference:

a.

The New Orleans Times Picayune of-19 April 1967 states

that Gordon Duane NOVEL (see Enclosura 19 of reference), then living

in Columbus, Obio, was the subject of extradition charges signed

17 April 1967 by Acting Governor C.C. Aycock. The chaiges concern

conspiracy to burglarize the munitions bunker at Houma, Louisiana,

in 1961. On 18 April 1967 NOVEL stated in an article copyrighted by

the Dallas Dally News that GARRISON is conducting his probe to

further his political career. "The whole GARRISON investigation

thing is fiction," NOVEL added.

"I know the full story from working

as the prosecutor's security chiei." GARRISON, howevet, has said

that NOVEL never worked for him. NOVEL added, "I think GARRI-

SON will expose some CIA operations in Louisiana."

b.

The New Orleans States-Item of 25 April 1967 states that

NOVEI, "has told a nurber of friends and intimates he was a CIA

operative and will use this role to battle GARRISON's charges . â¢ â¢

if he is returned to New Oleans to face accusations that he burglarized

an oil service company's munitions buaker in nearby Terrebone

Parish," Steven PLOTKIN, attorney for NOVEL, refused to confirm

or deny his client's statements. Sergio ARCACHA Smith (see Ea-

closure 2 of reference) is also accused by GARRISON of helping to

plan the theft of the munitions. The article adds, "To friends and

associates, NOVEL has said that the munitions burglary was no

burglary at all - but a war materials pickup made at the direction

of his CIA contact, " He bas described the Houma bunker as a CIA

cache for munitions destined for use in the April 1961 invasion at the

Bay of Pigs. NOVEL has claimed that he worked for CIA in New

Orleans before April 1961. "Part of his job, he contends, was to

operate the Evergreen Advertising Agency as a front for CLA

communications.

says be prepazed special radio commercials used on 300 stations

in the U.S. and Canada. Their cryptograpbic messages, he claims,

were to alert agents to the invasion date.. The commercials adver

tised aluminum Christmas trees, he says, and the key alert code

names were 'Star Chriatmas Irees' and 'Holiday Trees'. In late

1960, $72, 000 worth of radio time was placed by the agency. On the .

day the munitions were to be picked up, be says, he was called by his

CIA contact and told to join a group which was ordered to transport

munitions from the bunker to New Orleang.â¢. â¢ He says be made

the trip in his own automobile, a Lincoln, and met several people

there - all of ther allegedly acting for the CIA.. He identifies

them as FERRIE, ARCACHA, several Cubans, and another figure in

the case. Thay loaded the boxes of ordnance on trucks, he continues,

and returned to New Orleans where the explosives were dropped in

three spots - FERRIE's home, NOVEL's office building, and the

office of.. â¢ former FBlagent. â¢ â¢ Guy BANISTER. Ysee Enclosure

3 of reference). NOVEL claims the munitions were eventually taken

by boat to Cuba for a diversionary Bay of Pigs operation, GARRISON,

however, says the burglary occurred three months after the Bay of

Pigs. He adds that the Houma bunker was leased by the Schlumberger

Well Services Co. cl Houston, Texas. "Schlumberger officials say

they know nothing of any CIA operations in connection with their

magazine, where oil field service equipment and certain low-yield

explosives are stored. "

An AP wire dispatch of 26 April 1967 from New Orleans

adds, "In Columbus, NOVEL said today that 'the statements that I

worked for the CIA are absolutely incorrect... The events of

1961, the Bay of Pigs invasion, are sone of anybody's business,

including MI. GARRISON'g. *"

3. RI has no record of the Evergreen Advertising Agency. There

is, however, a record of "Evergreen Interpriae, " listed as "cover for

illegal activities". The pertinent document will be obtained and studied.
