RE: LEE HARVEY OSWALD

Absence of Payments to Oswald

Had any of our offices even made payments to him

under the SAC's authority, these would have been shown in

the receipts and vouchers submitted by each office. These

records have been checked and double checked and no such

payment was ever made.

Symbol Numbers Identifiable

Had Oswald been assigned a symbol number, this

number used, past or present. The number 179 supposedly

assigned Oswald is currently used by the Dallas Office

for a criminal informant, Velma Yvonne Graham, a Negro madam

who runs a house of prostitution. Min New Orleans, where Oswald

spent some time, the number 179 was used by the New Orleans

Office back in 1941 to designate an informant,

Joseph A.

Partridge, who was reporting security information and who was

discontinued in 1944.

As previously noted, once a number is

used in any capacity, whether to designate a security or a

criminal informant, it cannot be used by the field office again.

President Kennedy, our Legal Attache there currently

has a security informant 179 who was so designated in 1960.

He is Ignacio Olivo, who furnishes information on the Mexican-

Procedural Steps Never Taken

Furthermore, Oswald could not have been assigned such

a symbo. number without a prior background investigation by any

field office considering him for development.

Had any field

office considered developing him, it would have had to obtain

approval by the SOG. There is no record of any such request

by any field office and no record of any such approval.
