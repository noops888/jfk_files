Dallas T-24 advised on June 5, 1961, Justice of

the Peace GLEN BYRD said CIVELLO was highly perturbed..

because JOE CAMPISI introduced CIVELLO to ASAC BREEN on

the night of June 4, 1961.

T-24 said it is the concensus of

opinion of those in attendance that CAMPISI would be admonished

by CIVELLO because of the incident.

T-24 said JOE CAMPISI

continues to be the weak link among the Italian gamblers.

T-24 further advised that PETE INTERRANTE, owner

Ross's Drive-In, McKinney and Lemmon Streets is a cohort of

JOE CIVELLO'S.

T-24 recalled INTERRANTE a few years ago

was practically pennyless, however, recently he has acquired

a car for himself as well

as buy a new Corvette for his son.

He further stated PETE INTERRANTE will purchase any hot or

stolen merchandise that comes to his attention and will do

practically anything to make a dollar. He stated the premises

that Ross's Drive-In is located on is owned by JOE CIVELLO and

he is confident that since PETE INTERRANTE did not have any

funds for which to do business, that CIVELLO undoubtedly put

up the funds for this business.

He stated that he feels he

also has an underworld contact with CIVELLO and shee his

association with CIVELLO/has appeared to come into considerable

amounts of money. He recalled that Ross's Drive-In had

formerly been under the maiden name of PETE's wife, named

JOSEPHINE (last name unknown) however, she recently had the

registration of the property changed to JOSEPHINE INTERRANTE.

T-24 recalled that he and PETE INTERRANTE had a partnership

relation for a two week period a few years ago for the purpose

of going into business and getting a beer license, however,

he later learned INTERRANTE has a long criminal record and

the City would not authorize the issuance of a beer license to

not authoria th 4gg

that

PETE: INTERRANTE. Thereafter the partnership was disbanded. He

stated he feels that if INTERRANTE's background is brought to the

attention of local authorities the beer license for that property

will be repealed.

T-24 recalled the name which he had previously forgotten

as the man in the telephone company in Dallas who is closely

associated with the Italian criminal element. He said the man's

name is ACE LEWIS.

The true identity of the above person is believed to

be A. C. LEWIS, an executive in the business office of the

Southwestern Bell Telephone Company.
