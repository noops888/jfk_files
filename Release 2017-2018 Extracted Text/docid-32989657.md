PURPOSE:

To obtain authorization for high level dissemination

of a document captioned as above which shows the degree of

communist influence on Martin Luther King.

Enclosed is a document captioned as above, which

depicts communist influence in the civil rights field,

emphasizing the key role of Martin Luther King, JI. This

document is a current revision of the previous

analysis

, captioned "Communism and the Negro Movement - A Current Analysis,

preparea and disseminaied in ovenver, iôt.

is uniacing it,

we have emphasized these areas:

(1) continued reliance of King

upon former Communist Party, UsA, members, particularly stanley

David Levison; (2) facts relating to King's moral degeneracy,

and (3) communist goal of uniting the peace and civil rights

movements and King's adherence to this communist long-range

objective.

King's strong criticism and condemnation of the

Administration's policy on Vietnam in a speech he made at New York

on 4/4/67 shows how much he has been influenced by communist

advisors. His speech was a direct parallel of the communist

position on Vietnam.

It is felt that the President would be interested in

a summary on King which shows the degree of communist influence

on him.

The attached paper constitutes a complete picture and

strong indictment of King in that regard.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

It is recommended that

(1) The attached letters, with enclosures, to the

White House and the Attorney General be forwarded to Assistant

to the Director Deloach for transmittal to Mrs. Mildred Stegall

the White House, and the Attorney General.

RACIAL MATTERS (Article by

Martin Luther King,

Reference®

is made to the memorandum from Mr. Rosen to

MI. Belmont, 11/20/62 (copy attached), referring to the article

or hey. Martin Luther King, Jr., criticizing the work of the FBI

in relation to the Albany situation.

The question has been raised

as to whether we should not try to talk to king and set him straight

as to the Bureau's approach and activities.

7 WIEN

At the outset, it should be stated that it is questionable i,

whether an interview with King will be fruitful.

He have picked up

information in the past that king admits to being aarIS

cannot attora toadmit this publicly.

We knqw of his close tie-in

with Hunter Pitts Odell, a member of the National Committee of the

Communist Party, and we have seen various instances where King received

advice and his actions were apparently controlled, at least to some

extent, by the Communist Party.

• On the other hand, we do know that King has been in touch

with

the Attorney General from time to time, and in view of the

public image he has built up as a Negro leader he may fancy himself

as a leader using the assistance of, but independent of, the Communist

Party.

King.

(1) Mr. DeLoach feels that it would be desirable to interview

He recommends that he and Assistant Director Sullivan jointly

interview King•

He feels that two Bureau representatives should

interview King

in order that there will be a witness and there can

be. no charge of provincialism inasmuch as DeLoach comes from the

South and Mr. Sullivan comes from the North.

911 - X3

REC: A

154.150-

(2) Mr. Sullivan feels that King should be interviewed. He

feels, however, that if two Bureau representatives approach King, King

will be immediately on the defensive and no progress will be made.

He feels that King should be interviewed, initially, on a broad basis,

showing the Bureau's understanding of the racial and sociological

problems of the Negro, and thereafter the Bureau's position should

be built into this frame of reference. He believes that either

Mr. Deloach or himself should undertake the interview, individually.

(3) Mr. Sullivan suggests à third alternative. He is very

well acquainted with Dr. Douglas Jackson, a well known sociologist White

and a member of the faculty of Southern Methodist University in

Dallas. Dr. Jacisson is known to Sullivan as a man thoroughly and

soundly interested in solving the racial question in the South. He

is well known in different Negro areas for the stand that he has taken

and he is respected by them. Additionally, Dr. Jackson has been quite

interested in the work of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,

of which King is president.

Jackson has told Sullivan, as recently as a week and a half

ago in Indianapolis,

would assist the FBI he should simply make the request of him. Sullivan

believes we should also give consideration to having Dr. Jackson

approach sing and aiscuss this whole matter with him very thoroughly,

from a racial and sociological point of view, and ultimately clarify

in this discussion King's ideas on the FBI, and lay the groundwork

for King's support of the FBI. Sullivan would be perfectly willing

to brief Jackson on this entire matter and set the machinery in

motion, if it is so desired.

RECOMMENDATION:

The above three courses of action are set forth for the

Director's consideration. I personally favor #2.

RACIAL SITUATION

ALBANY, GEORGIA

RACIAL MATTERS.

An article has appeared in the "Atlanta Constitution," Atlanta, Georgia,

on 11/19462 which article was taken from the "New York Times." In the article,

Reverend Martin Luther King, JI., stated he agreed with the report written by

Howard Zinn issued by the Southern Regional Council concerning the recent racial

situation in Albany, Ceorgia. The report referrred to criticized the work of this

Bureau in relation to the Albany situation. King has stated among other things

that "Agents of the FBI in Albany, Georgia, sided with segregationists."

There are no facts to support this and it is noteworthy that the comments

by King would appear to dovetail with information which has been furnished to this

Bureau indicating that King's advisers are Communist Party (CP) members and

he is under the domination of the CP.

King is the President of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

and it ghould be noted that on 10/23/62 a communist infiltration investigation of

this organization was initiated. (100-438794)

• DETAILS:

The "New York Times" quoted King as stating he agreed with report

Issued 11/14/62 by the Southern Regional Council that the FBI had not been vigorous

in looking into denials of civil rights in Albany and the surrounding areas.

He

stated "Agents of the FBI in Albany, Georgia, sided with segregationists. " "One

of the great problems we face with the FBI in the South, "according to Reverend

the mores of their tomats To te ain their status thave bee to i tried by

with the local police and people who are promoting segregation. Every time I

saw FBI men in Albany they were with the local police force." It should be noted

there are five Agents assigned to the Albany, Georgia, Resident Agency. 'One is

from Indiana, one is from Massachusetts, one is from New York, one is from

Minnesota and one is from Georgia.

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont

RE: RACIAL SITUATION

Howard Zinn, the author of the report for the Southern Regional

Council, was mentioned in my memorandum 11/15/62 and has been the subject

of a security investigation by this Bureau (100-360217). Zinn was reportedly

a member of the CP from 1949 through 1953 and attended CP meetings during

that period. Zinn is a history professor at Spellman College in Atlanta. It

was the second slanted and biased document written by Zinn on the Albany

situation.

Reverend Mr. King is the President of the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference who arose to prominence during the 1955 - 1956

successful boycott which ended bus segregation in Montgomery, Alabama.

He has been active in Negro segregation matters since that time.

NY 694-5*, a top-level Informant, has advised that Stanley Levison,

a secret CP member sent word to Gus Fall, General Secretary CP USA,

during February, 1962, that King is a wholehearted Marxist who had studied,

it, believed in it and agrees with it He cannot, however, rublic espouse

it in view.of.his.position as-a-minister-of religlot. Fevison is an Associate

Director of the Southern Christian Leadershin Conference and is actively

Involved in the operations of that organtiation.

The New York representatiye of the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference is Hunter Pitts O'Dell who was elected under a pseudonym, „Corneilus

James, to the National Committee of the CR.USA in December, 1959. On 8/1/62

James Jackson then Editor of"The World' told NY 694-g* that an article attributed:

to king in the 343/62 issue of. "The Nation! magazine was actually written by

O'Dell. The article was captoneds

Fumbling on the New Frontier.

" and purports

to be a report on Clvil Rights.,

_NY 694-S* advised that Lenent Harris, CP USA functionary had

commented that Stanley Levison by reason of his association with the Martin

Lather King Movement was doing the most important work in the CF at that

time.

Harris stated "The party has the Kennedys in its pocket" since the"

Kennedy Administration is politically dependent upon Kinge

This was furnished

te, to white. puse and to the Attorney Attorney«Genoralion-6/4/C82una.

Y 3580-S* advised on 8/7/62 that while in conversation with O'Dell,

Levison asked how things were in Albany, Georgia. O'Dell replied that there

was a leadership problem down there and things could get quite disorganized

it "our", staff was not there.

Memorandum to Mir. Belmont

REX RACIAL SITUATION

On 8/10/62 XY 3580-5* advised that on the afternoon of that date

carence Jones, a member ol the Labor Youth League in 1954 (a cited organization)

and Levison were discussing burning of churches in the South, both expressed the

opinion that King should not be silent in this matter but should send a hot wire to

'Kennedy" expressing his indignance at the Government's failure to control one

small community. This was furnished to the Attorney General on 9/11/62.

RECOMMENDATION:

Consideration has been given to contacting King to straighten him out;

however, this seems undesirable in view of the above facts and it is recommended

he not be contacted.

The background information regarding King, Levison and Zinn has

been furnished to the Department.

Nothing would seem to be gained by contacting the "New York Times"

or the "Atlanta Constitution" as we obviously cannot give them background data

we possess on the CP influence of King.

The Department and the Attorney General have been publicly

criticized on many occasions by ling and yet they are cooperating with him.

It la recommended that the Ilaison Section of the Domestic Intelligence

Division bring King'a comments in the article to the attention of Stall Director

Berl I. Bernhard of the U. 5. Commission on Civil Fights And point out to hira

that there is no basis in factior King's remarks and in addition point out that 4 ol

the 5 Resident Agents assigned at Albany, Georgia, are from northern states and

one is from Georgie.

RACIAL MATTERS (Article by

critical of FBI)

'Mr. Belmont's memorandum of November 26, 1962, reflected the

alternatives in interviewing Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., who had criticized the

work of the FBI in relation to the Albany situation. The Director approved the

suggestion that Mr. Sullivan and I handle the interview with Rev. King.

Following approval, I immediately tried to contact Rev. King telephonicall!

on November 27, 1962.

Rev. King does not have a phone at his residence. We then attempted to

contact him at his church in Atlanta. His secretary advised, upon being told who

was trying to contact him, that Rev. King was "off in another building writing a book.

She further stated that Rev. King preferred not to be disturbed and that it would be

impossible to talk to him.

That same day I called the SAC at Atlanta and instructed

him to attempt to contact Rev. King and set up an interview for Mr. Sullivan and me.

SAC Atlanta advised the following day, November 28, that Rev. King had left

instructions with his secretary that he did not have time for an interview, that he was

moving around the country. The secretary further advised the SAC that Rev. King

would call us when he was willing to sit down for an interview, Rev. King has not

called since that date.

It would appear obvious that Rev. King does not desire to be told the

frue tacts. He abriously used decoit, lies and treachery as propaganda to further

his own causes.

Realizing the above, I recommended, the Director approved, that I

talk with Mr. MacKay, publisher of the four Afro-American newspapers.

This

interview was handled and reported by memorandum. The interview was based on the

fact that the Afro-American newspapers had published Rev. King's lies, quoting

him exclusively. In talking with Mr. MacKay I carefully went over each allegation

Yby Rev. King and set him straight with respect to these lies.

argument and in the following week's issue of his newspapers quoted us for

the record. A letter was also prepared to John H. Sengstacke, Publisher, endled

"Chicago Defender," dated November 29, 1962, (copy attached) setting the

record straight. Sengstacke, whom we know most favorably, published the letter

putting the lie to Rev. King's allegations.

ACTION:

The record concerning Rev. King's allegations has been covered.

Interviews with the publishers of the newspapers who carried Rev. King's lies

have been conducted and they have been set straight. I see no further need to

contacting Rev. King inasmuch as he obviously does not desire to be given the

truth. The fact that he is a vicious liar is amply demonstrated in the fact

he constantly associates with and takes instructions from Stanley Levison who

is a hidden member of the Communist Party in New York.

SUBJECT:

MARTIN LUTHER KING

INFORMATION CONCERNING

An individual who identified himself as Dr. Andrew Young:

Executive

Assistant to Martin Luther King, called from New York City at 12:05 p.m. today and

asked to speak with me.

Dr. Young stated I probably knew what he was calling about. I told him

I did if he was calling with reference to Reverend King's request for an appointment

with Mr. Hoover. I mentioned that the Acting Attorney General had called this morning

about this matter and that I had just advised the Acting Attorney General that Mr. Hoover

would see Reverend King at 3:30 p.m. today. Dr. Young stated this would press them a

bit, however, he thought they could make it.

Dr. Young stated that Reverend King wanted to talk about law

enforcement in the future. He stated they have several programs at Selma, Alabama,

and in the Blackbelt Countys surrounding Selma. He stated this might be a bad time for

Reverend King to be discussing matters, however, they feel that they have been negligent

in that they have contacted the Department in the past and have not set down with the FBI.

• Dr. Young stated that Reverend King merely wanted to sit down with

Mr. Hoover and discuss matters. He staied that Reverend King did not desire to complai

but merely to find out what type of protection the FBI will offer Negro citizens when they

attempt to exercise their rights in the future. I interrupted Dr. Young at this point and

stated I felt certain that both he and Reverend King fully understood that the FBI did not

have the authority or jurisdiction to "protect" anyone and that if Reverend King was

seeking a change in policy in this regard he should talk to the Acting Attorney General and

not Mir. Hoover. Dr. Young made no reference to this statement but spoke up again and

stated that there had been a breach and misunderstanding between Reverend King's

organization and the FBI in the past ap bat this was a matter they did not want to

Re: Martin Luther King

DI. Young assured me that Reverend King did not want to mention anything

that has come up in the past. He stated, as a matter of fact, people are harassing them

to death and they cannot get any work done in their office because they have to answer

questions concerning the FBI. He then added that Reverend King was mest anxious and

willing to meet with the Director and particularly wanted to do so before he departed for

Oslo, Norway.

I interrupted Dr. Young again at this point and told him that it was useless

for them to request a "peace meeting" with us as long as the crusade of defamation agains

Mr. Hoover and the FBI was to be carried on by Reverend King and his organization.

Dr. Young stated that he understood this. He stated that actually "they" feel that the FBI

has done a very sound investigative job. He added that the current misunderstanding is

something that should be cleared up. He then asked me if I knew of any conditions for

the meeting. I told him that the only condition desired was that there be an understanding

that the campaign of slander and defamation against the Director and the FBI by

Reverend King and his organization, behind our backs, be dropped. Dr. Young replied,

"yes." He then asked it there would be any objections if he and Reverend Abernathy

accompanied Reverend King. I told him there woaid be none. He asked again the time of

"the appointment and I told him 3:30 p.m. today. He again stated inat this wouia press

them, however, he thought they could make it.

Dr. Young asked me if the FBI planed to make any announcement

concerning the meeting. I told him that we would make no announcement at this time.

He inquired as to whether Reverend King should make an announcement. I told him this

was entirely up to Reverend King.

At 12:25 p.m. today we received & call from the wire services indicating

that Bayard Rustin had just announced in New York that Reverend King would meet with

the Director at 3:30 p.m. this afternoon. It was quite obvious that this group already

had their press release prepared with the exception of the time element.

The following sets forth details of difficulties encountered in

attempts to contact Martin Luther King, Jr.

The "New York Times" 11/19/62 quoted King to the effect that the

FBI had not done an effective.job in Albany, Georgia, and one of the great

problems with the Bureau in the South was that the Agents were white

Southerners.

Actually, four of the five Agents assigned to Albany, Georgia,

were Northern born.

It was approved that Mi. Sullivan and Mr. DeLoach would make an

appointment with king to straighten him out concerning, the statements he

reportedly had made.

On 11/30/62 Mr. DeLoach attempted to contact King to arrange the

interview. The Atanta operator advised there was no telephone at the

residence usually occupied by King and the operator then tried to reach

him at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. Someone at the church

stated that King was on a two weeks vacation and could not be reached.

Upon being asked if King was near a telephone, this person replied in

affirmative but stated that King did not wish

to be disturbed.

The Atlanta Office then was instructed to attempt to locate King

by telephone and advise him that Mr. DeLoach and Mr. Sullivan wished to

sit down and have a chat with him any time he was in the Washington or

New York area.

King's secretary was then contacted by the Atlanta Office

on 11/30/62, and the secretary stated that Kingwas at a hideaway writing a

book and could not be reached for the week of November 30.

The secretary

stated that the following week King would be traveling in Alabama.

secretary was requested to have King contact the Atlanta Office with regard

to an urgent matter, however,

King,

never made such a contact.

REG-LI

Special Agent Charles S. Harding by letter

ót 11/20169 has

remarked that when he attempted to contact King to make the appointment for

Mx. DeLoach,- King and his staff completely ignored the. FBI even though

they

was a matter of utmost urgency.

RE:

DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED IN ATTEMPTING TO

CONTACT MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

On about July 18 to July 20, 1961, attempts were made to make

an appointment with king to interview

him in connection with the

investigation of Theodore Edward Brown who was under investigation as a

special inquiry for the Peace Corps.

On July 19 or July 20, King's

secretary stated that "Dr. King can see you on Saturday afternoon but

you don't work Saturdays, do you?" His secretary was advised that the

Agent would be at King's

office any time King would be available.

definite appointment was made for 2 p.m. Saturday afternoon July 22, 1961.

The Agent appeared at King's office at approximately 1:50 p.m. where he

waited for an hour before being admitted to King's office.

King stated

he was sorry to keep the Agent waiting but he was behind in his paper

work and had completed some of it before admitting

the Agent.

In June, 1962, efforts were made to obtain an appointment with

King in connection with

a case involving Shirley Blackwell Cummings, a

Peace Corps applicant.

Beginning on approximately 6/5/62, King's

(=

secretary kept stating that he was not available for interview although

Tit was known to us that he was in his office daily. On 6/8/62 wyat

makery king"s assistert, advised the Atlanta office that he and king

were proceeding

; to Shreveport, Louisiana, in connection with the voter

registration drive and that the Little Union Baptist Church in

Shreveport had received a bomb threat. At that time, Walker was informed

that Agents had been urgently trying to make an appointment with King

and Walker stated an appointment would be made. On 6/8/62 King telephoned

the Atlanta Office from Shreveport to inquire

as to why the Agent wanted

an appointment and to advise of the bomb threat previously furnished by

Walker. King consented to interview which was conducted 6/9/62.

King was also interviewed by the Atlanta Office on 7/24/62

in connection with racial incidents at Albany, Georgia, involving

alleged violation by King of a temporary restraining order issued by

the U. S. District Court to stop demonstrations. The interview was

conducted in the U. S. courtroom where King had appeared for a bearing.

On 6/25/63 the Atlanta Office attempted to contact King to

advise him of a threat against his life. Efforts to contact him were

at first unsuccessful, but after a delay of some hours, King's secretary

informed him of the Bureau's interest in talking to him and arrangements

were made for an Agent to contact King by telephone.

FALSE STATEMENTS REGARDING

FBI INVESTIGATIONS OF

CIVIL RIGHTS CASES

After reviewing files to ascertain all available facts which might be

needed in an interview with Dr. King, Mr. Sullivan and I made an attempt to contact

Dr. King in Atlanta, Georgia, Friday, November 30.

FUNER

The Atlanta operator advised that there was no telephone at the residence

usually occupied by Dr. King. The operator next tried the Ebenezer Baptist Church

in Atlanta. A person there advised that Dr. King was away on two weeks vacation

and could not be reached. Upon being asked it Dr. King was near a telephone, this

person replied in the attirmative but stated bi. King did not wish to be aisturpea

I called our Atlanta Office and in the SAC's absence, talked with

ASAC Hitt. I instructed him to attempt to telephonically locate Dr. King and tell him

that Mr. Sullivan and I desired to sit down and have a chat with him any time he

was in the Washington or New York area. ASAC Hitt was specifically told to indicate

to Dr. King. that the desired conversation was not as a result of an investigation

concerning Dr. King but merely for purposes of a chat with him.

*ASAC Hitt called back at 2:30 PM, November 30, to advise that one of

King's assistants had told him that King is at a "hideaway" writing a book and could not

be reached.

He stated that King will be in Alabama all of next week and will then

return to Atlanta and will call ASAC Hitt at that time. ASAC Hitt mentioned it is

King's usual policy to let a day or two pass, following an attempt to get in touch with

him, and he will then return the call.

COMMUNIST BACKGROUND AND AFFILIATIONS

Martin Luther King constitutes a national security problem

in light of the fact that, being a leader of an estimated 20, 000, 000 Negroes

in their struggle for civil rights, he has knowingly, willingly and

regularly cooperated with and taken guidance from the communists. Heis

an unprincipled, opportunistic individual who is considered and describec

within the Communist Pacty USA, as a Marxist.

In King's rise to national prominence, he has been closely

allied with the communists. He has shown not only a willingness but even

an eagerness to accept communist aid, to support communist causes

and to work closely with and rely upon the advice and guidance of dedicated

communists with concealed affiliations, despite the fact that they have

been identified reliably to him as such.

Among individuals with communisi vaisgrounds with whom

King has associated is Stanley David Levison. Levison has dedicated a

part of his life to advancing the communist cause in this country. Levison

has been instrumental in providing financial assistance to King, in giving

personal advice and helping him organize his activities. The two have

been observed personally meeting on a number of occasions since

November, 1963. As of October 30, 1964, plans were underway for a

personal meeting of King and Clarence Jones with Levison which was to

take place in the near future in Atlanta. Levison's contacts with King have manly

been handled through an intermediary, Clarence Jones, who is also a

frequent adviser to King. Jones is General Counsel for the Gandhi Society

for Human Rights, a fund-raising adjunt of the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference (SCLC). During the mid-1950's Jones held a

position of leadership in the Labor Youth League, the Party's youth

organization. As recently as November 24, 1964, King contacted Jones

and asked that Jones and Levison, among others, submit five-minute

speeches which King could use in accepting the Nobel Peace Prize: King

would select the best material from these speeches.

Another individual with a communist background on whom

King depends is Hunter Pitts O'Dell, who, in December, 1959, was

elected at the Party's National Convention as a member of the Party's

2

- NW 55234

DocId: 32989657

Page 35

---

## Page 36

National Committee under a pseudonym. In 1961, O'Dell was made

administrator of the SCLC's New York Office. In addition, two other

Party members, Hazel Gray and Loretta Pauker, worked there under

('Doll at one time or another. Later, O'Dell worked for King's group

In Atlanta, Georgia, using the name J. H. O'Dell. But in October, 1962,

several newspaper articles exposed his connection with the SCLC and his

communist affiliations. King reacted by trying to minimize O'Dell's

role with his organization and pretended ignorance of O'Dell's communist

sitiliations. King said O'Dell had temporarily resigned pending an inquiry.

Later, the resignation became permanent, not, as King put it, because the

SCLC inquiry had disclosed any present connections between O'Dell and the

Communist Party but because of the emotional public response.

Actually, King's reluctance to dismiss O'Dell stems not only

on his dependence on him, but also King's reported dedication to Marxism-

Bossible to evidence friendship toward the Soviet Union Moreover, King

has been described within the Communist Party as a true, genuine

Marxist-Leninist "from the top of his head to the tips of his toes."

Another key King adviser with a communist background is

Bayard Rustin, the former Young Communist League member, who at one

tune was Assistant Secretary of the SCLC. Rustin has been convicted on a

tomusexual charge.

Actually, King is a hypocrite, a fraud and a cheat who, under

sie juise of religion and patriotism, is deceiving millions of Americans.

MoRise conour of

MARFEN LUTHER KING.

King engeavors to pass himselt oft as a Clergyman; however.

his morat conduci is vi the lowest grade. When pressed concerting his

relationship with communists, he seeks refuge in his role as a clergyman.

On one occasion, for example, he was asked by reporters if he

took orders from the communists and also whether he took them from

Stanley Levison.

He replied that he took orders only from God. But his

personal conduct belies it. To all outward appearances, King, copastor

with his father of the Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia, is a

respectable man who resides with his wife and children in Atlanta._ The

tacts concerning his private life, however, stamp him as a moral degenerate.

He is known to have engaged in a series of extramarital relations not only in

Alanta, but as he travels about the countrye.

missioner 7957

On January 6-7, 1964, a Washington, D.C., hotel was the scene

of such activities on the part of King and some of his SCLC associates as to

reveal the true nature of this man. At least 12 indiviavars, near equally

aivided beiween males and females and, including king, officers of the SCLC

and others bearing the title of "Reverend,' participated in a two-day sex orgy,

the details of which are

shocking to everthe mosi sophisticated. Excessive

consumption of alcohol and the use of the vilest language imaginable served

only as a backdrop to acts of degeneracy and depravity, many of which were in

a communal atmosphere with the onlookers as "entertained" as the participants.

Many of those present engaged in sexual acts, natural as well as unnatural.

King more than once boasted of his drunken condition. When one of the females

shied away from engaging in an unnatural act, King and other of the males

discussed how she was to be taught and itiated in this respect.

During the period February 20-25, 1964, Los Angetes, Cálifornia,

was the scene of another of King's immoral "adventures," his partner in this

escapade being a married woman with whom he has had several illicit diversions.

The dates of April 22, 24 and 25, 1964, found King again spending nights in a

motel room with some of his west coast paramours, one of whom, his apparent.

favorite, was the marzied woman who was his partner in February, 1964.

sex orgies during the early morming hours. of April 27, 1964. A prostitul

advised that she was engaged for King by a female intermediary and reer!

$100 for her services. King and an associate indulged in repeated acts:

sexual intercourse with the prostitute in the presence of the female wi

LAVE

N

engaged the prostitute. All four individuals participated in unnatural acts.

The prostitute summed up her reactions with the remark "That was the worst

orgy I've ever gone through. "

The period July 8-9, 1964, witnessed a continuation of King's

extramarital activities in Los Angetes. During the early evening hours of

July 8, 1964, he had sexual reiations with his Los Angeles "favorite"

and later

spent the night with another female with whom he had relations.

As can be seen from the above, it is an established fact beyond

any question that King not only regularly indulges in adulterous acts, but he

also, from one end of the country to the other, engages in group sexual orgies

with definite abnormal manifestations.

Many of the responsible leaders in the Negro movement apparently

are aware of King's degenerate moral character. Representatives of the news

me dia are also aware of this fact as indicated by their inquiries to responsible

Negro leaders such as Roy Wilkins, Executive Secretary of the NAACP.

Roy Wilkins voiced this very concern in his contact with Vir. DeLoach

on November 27th. He also realizes that King is a liar and has little respect

for him. Wilkins and his associates would like to see King eased out of his

leadership capacity and perhaps take over the presidency of a small college or

perhaps accept a position as a pastor of a large Negro church and thereby retire

forever as a leader of the Negroes.

MARTIN LUTHER KING'S CRITICISVI OF THE

DIRECTOR AND FBI

CURRENT ATTACK:

On November 19, 1964, Martin Luther King, Jr., sent a

telegram from Atlanta to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover concerning Mr. Hoover's

remarks to the press the previous day. Set forth below is an analysis of this

telegram.

King States:

He has questioned the FBI's effectiveness but has never

attributed this merely to the presence of Southerners in

the FBI.

Facts:

In November, 1962, in discussing racial disturbances in Albany,

Georgia, bing was wiaoly quotea in the prcos as stating thâi onê

Of the greatest problems regarding the tBi in the south is that the Agents

are white Southerners who have been influenced by the mores of the community.

This is, of course, absolutely false, and it is noted that four of the five Agents

then assigned to Albany, Georgia, were Northerners.

King States:

Not a single arrest was made in Albany, Georgia, during

the many brutalities against Negroes.

Facts:

During the summer of 1962, there was a continuing series of

mass racial meetings, marches and demonstrations by Negroes

in the Albany, Georgia, area.

This resulted in numerous multiple arrests of

Negroes for lying down in the street, blocking traffic and disorderly conduct.

During this period, numerous allegations of civil rights violations were made to

FBI Agents and Department of Justice officials. In every instance the Department

of Justice was advised of the complaint and the results of any investigation

conducted. Any additional investigation requested by the Department was

immediately and thoroughly run out and the results furnished to the Department.

The Department of Justice did not see fit to prosecute any of the incidents

arising out of these demonstrations.

NW 55234

DocId: 32989657

## Page 40

During this same period, however, prosecution was brought

against Denver Edgar Short, Jr., Deputy Marshal, Sasser, Georgia, which is

about 20 miles from Albany. Short allegedly intimidated voter registration

workers on August 30, 1962, and FBI investigation developed that Short cursed

the victims, ordered them out of town and fired his gun in the direction of

their tires. AU. S. District Court Petit Jury acquitted Short of civil rights

charges on January 25, 1963.

It is also noted that on 9-17-62, FBI Agents arrested four white

subjects in the vicinity of the I Hope Baptist church, a Negro church near Dawson,

Georgia, and about 30 miles from Albany, which had been burned that day. In

the absence of a Federal violation, confessions obtained by FBI Agents were made

available to local authorities resulting in a seven year sentence for each of the

three adult subjects and three years probation for the fourth subject who was a

juvenile.

On 10-4-62 FBI Agents arrested Jack Phelix Smith and a detainer

was placed against Douglas Howard Parker, a state prisoner, on civil rights

charges in connection with the burning of the Shady Grove Baptist Church near

Leesburg, Georgia, on 8-15-62. This was a Negro church approximately 12

miles from Albany. Smith and Parker are white. A Federal Grand Jury failed

to indict, and FBI evidence was made available to state officials who presented

the case to a local grand jury which also returned a no bill.

King States:

Not a single arrest has been made in connection with the

bombing in Birmingham or the three murdered civil rights

workers in Mississippi.

Facts:

The Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, Birmingham, Alabama, was

bombed 9-15-63 killing four Negro children. The FBI immediately

launched the most intensive type of investigation which is still vigorously continuing.

This investigation was prejudiced by premature arrests made by the Alabama

Highway Patrol, and consequently, it has not yet been possible to obtain evidence

or confessions that would insure successful prosecution although the FBI has

identified a small group of Klansmen believed to be responsible.

The FBI launched a massive investigation following the disappearance

of the three civil rights workers in the vicinity of Philadelphia, Mississippi, on

June 21, 1964. The FBI located their bodies in an earthen dam and has developed

information identifying those responsible. Intensive investigation is continuing

to develop the case for prosecution as quickly as possible.

It should be noted that FBI recent investigations in Mississippi

have produced the following positive results: (1) Eleven arrests in McComb

on state charges involving bombings and other violence. Nine of those arrested

have pleaded guilty ur noiu contendere and received probationary sentences;

(2) Seven arrests in Natchez on state charges involving shooting incidents and

a beating; (3) Two subjects arrested on state murder charges 11/6/64 in connection

with the killing of Henry Hezekiah Dee and Charlie Eddie Moore; (4) Seven

arrests for racial violence by the Sheriff of Pike County who stated this resulted

from his success in practicing FBI methods he observed during the FBI's recent

investigations; and (5) FBI Agents have arrested five present and former law

enforcement officers in Neshoba County on charges of police brutality. They are

presently awaiting trial.

King States:

FBI Agents work with local officers on criminal cases making

it difficult for them to

effectively function where Negroes are

threatened.

Facts:

This is a shopworn canard, the falsity of which is clearly

illustrated by the FBI's currently effective cooperation with

local officers in Mississippi, FBI's arrest of five officers in Neshoba County,

Mississippi, FBI's effective cooperation with local officers in the Georgia church

burning investigations, the Penn murder case and many other cases in all parts

of the country.

King States:

He has no record of a request from the Director to meet with

him.

Facts:

In November, 1962, FBI officials sought to make an appointment

with King to straighten him out with regard to his public remarks

call the FBI when he was willing to arrange an interview. He made no further

response.

King States:

He has always made himself available to Atlanta FBI Agents.

Facts:

In July, 1961, it was necessary for the FBI to contact King in

connection with a special inquiry investigation for the Peace

Corps. An appointment was made through King's secretary for his interview

7/22/61; however, King kept the FBI Agent waiting for one hour past the appointed

time and stated he was behind in his paper work and had completed some of it

before admitting the Agent.

## Page 42

In June, 1962, the FBI made efforts to obtain an appointment

with King in connection with a case involving a Peace Corps applicant. Beginning

on approximately 6/5/62, King's secretary kept stating that he was not

available for interview although it was known to the FBI that he was in his

office daily. On 6/8/62 Wyatt T. Walker, King's assistant, advised the Atlanta

Office that he and King were proceeding to Shreveport, Louisiana, in connection

with the voter registration drive and that the Little Union Baptist Church in

Shreveport had received a bomb threat. At that time, Walker was informed that

FBI Agents had been urgently trying to make an appointment with King and Walker

stated an appointment would be made. On 6-8-62, King telephoned the Atlanta

Office from Shreveport to inquire as to why the Agent wanted, an appointment and

to advise of the bomb threat previously furnished by Walker. King consented to

interview which was conducted 6-9-62.

King was also interviewed by the Atlanta FBI Office on 7-24-62 in

connection with racial incidents at Albany, Georgia, involving alleged violation by

King of a temporary restraining order issued by the U. S. District Court to stop

demonstrations. The interview was conducted in the U. S. courtroom where King

had appeared for a hearing.

On 11-30-62, when FBI Headquarters officials were attempting to

arrange an interview with King, the Atlanta FBI Office contacted King's secretary

to make such an appointment at King's convenience. The Agent was advised that

King was writing a book and could not be reached. King's secretary was requested

to have King contact the Atlanta Office on an urgent matter but he never made

such a contact.

On 6-25-63 the Atlanta FBI Office attempted to contact King to advise

him of a threat against his life. Efforts to contact him were at first unsuccessful,

but after a delay of some hours, King's secretary informed him of the Bureau's

interest in talking to him and arrangements were made for an Agent to contact

King by telephone.

In connection with this whole matter, it should be kept in mind that

the FBI's function is purely investigative in nature. It is not empowered to offer

protection to anyone, at any place, at any time.

PREVIOUS ATTACKS:

Generally, King's previous attacks against the Director and the

FBI in the civil rights field have been similar to those outlined above. As an

example is the criticism carried in The New York Times of November 19, 1962;

in essence King claimed the FBI in Albany, Georgia, sides with the segregationists.

He also said the FBI has not done an effective job in investigating beatings of

Negroes in Georgia. His remarks were made after giving a sermon at the

Riverside Baptist Church in New York City.

FBI ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS FIELD

Every civil rights complaint is given thorough,

prompt and impartial attention. Special Agents handling these

cases are highly trained investigators who have completed

advanced training courses which qualify them to conduct civil

rights investigations. At Bureau Headquarters, a select staff

of men with great experience and knowledge of this type of

investigation supervise the cases.

The duty of maintaining law and order in civil rights

demonstrations, preserving the peace and protecting life and

property is the primary responsibility of local and state law

enforcement agencies. The FBI is solely an investigative agency

as distinguished from a police agency, and as such, is without

authority to maintain the peace or furnish protection. It is the

duty of the FBI, however, to furnish factual data to the Department

of Justice so that a determination can be made as to whether there

is any basis for Federal action under the civil rights statute.

Our work in the field of civil rights is increasing.

In fiscal year 1960, the FBI handled 1, 398 civil rights cases.

In fiscal year 1963, the number of cases jumped to 2, 692 and in fiscal

year 1964, it increased to 3, 340.

Although a substantial number of arrests and convictions

have resulted from our investigations in these matters, the eftective-

ness of our work in this field can never be precisely assayed on the

basis of such statistics. Perhaps the greatest value of our work

in this field lies in the results of our intelligence and liaison programs

which can never be traced to direct prosecutive action. We continu-

ously gather information on a day-to-day basis which indicates that

some violent action is either being definitely planned or that a

situation will occur which has a high potential for violence. *

The fact that we vigorously investigate civil rights

violations undoubtedly serves as a deterrent to discourage violations

*Such information is immediately disseminated to appropriate authorities.

ORGANIZATION OF THE CURRENT

ATTACK AGAINST THE FBIBY

MARTIN LUTHER KING

On November 19, 1964, the day after the Director's press

conference, Martin Luther King, JX., contacted his secretary, Dora

at the Atlanta, Georgia, office of the Southern Christian

Leadership Conterence (SCLC), according to a retable source. She told

him his telegram to Mr. Hoover regarding the Director's criticism of

King was going out to the press. King stated he wanted to issue a statesman-

like "covering statement" in connection with the telegram.

King declared the nature of the follow-up statement would be

that he cannot conceive of Mr. Hoover's labeling King a liar unless he

(Mi. Hoover) was under extreme pressure and apparently had faltered under

the tremendous burdens, complexities and responsibilities of his office. King

said he would state he cannot become involved in a public debate with Mr. Hoover

and that he has nothing but sympathy for the Director who has served his country

so well. King told his secretary the telegram and the statement will be the

oilty comment he will personally issue in this matter.

He told her Mr. Hoover

should retire because he is "too ola and broken down."

King instructed his secretary to have Randolph I. Blackwell,

Program Coordinator of SCLC, go over the press release and telegram.

He stated the release should be given

tong

those who are "for us," naming

Catherine Johnson of Associated Press of United Press International, one Don

Nickee, and Ted Poston of the "New York Post. "

King later talked to his aide, Bernard. Lee, the source advised,

and told Lee to be sure all Negro news media

to call "Jet"' magazine, a Negro publication, and to give a copy of the release

to one John Herbert in New York. Lee told King, m answer to a question

as

to what was wrong with Mi.

Hoover, that he thought the Director was getting

old and is a "sacred cow i

King directed Lee to have Bayard Rustin in New York and

Walter Fauntroy, SChC representative in Washington, D. Co, contacted and

told to start criticism of the FBI in those areas, He said he already had

started in Miami, Florida. He instructed that Slater King, a civil rights leader

in Albany, Georgia, should be contacted since he would welcome an opportunity

to make a statement against the FBI and the Director. Blackwell did this later

that day.

King declared people in the western states who are SCLC members

10

NN 55234 DooId: 32989657

Page 45

---

## Page 46

must be contacted to have them begin the attack against the fbi.

King

told Lee that telegrams to Mi. Hoover should also be sent to the President.

King declared that Blackwell and Cordy T. Vavian, Director

of Affiliates of SCLC, should handle the attack on the FBIso it would not

appear that ling was fighting the Director over a personal matter. He said

the President should censure Mr. Hoover and it would be a good idea for all

telegrams to the President to request this.

On the same date, according to the source, King told Vivian

this is the time to attack the whole FBI. He declared that he cannot be the one

who does it, stating "we" need people in the South to make statements about

the laxity of investigations and law enforcement, especially concerning civil

rights. People in the North are needed to protest Mr. Hoover's charge

against King. King suggested telegrams beysent to the President urging Mr.

Hoover be censured and urging he be retired because "he is old and getting

senile."

The source reported Vivian suggested the attack be based on

| Mr. Hoover's ineffectiveness in civilrights: that he is past retirement age and

would have been out last year except for certain people asking that he stay un.

King disagreed, asserting he wanted Mr. Hoover "hit from all sides."

Later on November 19, 1964, the source related that Wyatt

Walker, a former SCLC executive now employed by a firm in New York City,

contacted Vivian. He was told by Vivian to "get thing's going" in New York,

Vivian told Walker to handle the east coast and said Tom Kilgore, an official

of the Western Christian Leadership Conference in Los Angeles,

California,

was to handle the west coast. Vivian mstructed Walker to get telegrams sent

to the President, Department of Justice and the FBI demanding that Mr. Hoover

apologize to King.

Vivian told Walker that this is an opportunity to mount an

attack against police brutality. He said the FBI will try to defend itself with

the statement that it is an investigative agency and that people making the protest

should know what to expect from the FBI. Vivian later contacted Kilgore and

gave him similar instructions.

According to a highly confidential Atlanta intormant, one

Reverend Hodge, location unknown, contacted Vivian andwanted methods SCLC

was using against Hoover. Vivian advised SCLC files failed to indicate Hoover

ever tried to contact King. Vivian gave Hodge the following points to get across

concerning Hoover and the FBI:

1!

55234

DocId: 32989657

Page 46

---

## Page 47

(1) FBI has been ineffective in that no persons have been

brought to trial (In Albany only Negroes went to jail.);

(2)

FBI is only investigative arm which Vivian claims is

ridiculous in that investigations have not been good enough for convictions

and reports are available only to FBI and Department of Justice. (ECi

example, one of SCLC staff members was shot at Greenville along with two

other people and nothing was done about it.);

(3) Hoover never tried to get in contact with King to verify

statement;

(4) King did not tell people not to contact FBI;

(5) FBI has jurisdiction whenever civil Liberties have been

violated. Vivian claimed Director had no evidence to support Director's

Statements against King. Vivian further claimed King does not want to debate

the Director but it is their job as subordinates to handle the criticism against

(Hoover and the FBI. Vivian claims the Director's statement concerning pressure

groups is vague ana full ofgeneralities and Hoover is more interesied in

John Birch Society, Minutemen and Ku klux Kian but will not attack them.

Vivian

claimed "we" had statements sent from all civil rights leaders to the President

from James Farmer of CORE, Wilkins OL NAACP and Jack Greenberg Of

African Union.

The source continued that Vivian claimed the main points to

drive home are that the investigations and reports of the FBl can only be seen

by Justice Department and he feels reports are inadequate,

Identities of Individuals Mentioned:

Randolph T. Blackwell, according to a confidential source in

1953, had been a member of the Communist Party (Ch In the District Of

Columbia, and another source indicated Blackwell attended a Labor Youth

League (cited by the Department of Justice) Convention.

A confidential source advised in November,

194%, that Cordy I.

Vivian was a member of the CP in Peoria, Illinois, and had been active in

CP affairs for some time.

Bayard Rustin, in July, 1964, issues of "The Saturday Evening

Post" was said to have gone to New York in 1938 as an organizer for the

Young Communist League and as such had the job & recruiting students for the

"Party! He reportedly left the Party in 1941.

ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT MARTIN LUTHER KING

On November 19, 1962, the "New York Times" quoted King to

the effect that the FBI had not done an effective job in Albany, Georgia, and one

of the greatest problems with the Bureau in the South was that the Agents were

white Southerners. (Actually, four of the five Agents assigned to Albany, Georgia,

were Northern born.) With regard to this matter, it was approved that Assistant

Directors Sullivan and DeLoach make an appointment with King to straighten him out

concerning the unfounded criticism he reportedly had made.

On November 30, 1962, Mr. DeLoach attempted to reach King by

telephone to arrange an interview. The Atlanta operator advised that there was

no telephone at the residence usually occupied by King. Then the operator tried to

reach King at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta; however, an individual there

stated that King was away on two weeks' vacation and could not be reached. Upon

being asked it King was near a telephone, this person replied affirmatively but

stated King did not wish to be disturbed.

Mr. DeLoach then called the Atlanta Office and instructed ASAC

F. V. Hitt (now on Inspection Staff) to telephonically locate King and tell him

(1) that Messrs. DeLoach and Sullivan wanted to sit down with him any time he

was in the Washington or New York area; and (2) that the desired conversation did

not involve an investigation of King but stemmed from a desire to talk to King.

The Atlanta Office then succeeded in contacting King's secretary

on November 30, 1962, and was advised that King was at a "hideaway" writing a

book and could not be reached during the week of November 30th. The secretary

further advised that the following week King would be traveling in Alabama. The

secretary was requested to have King contact the Atlanta Office with regard to an

urgent matter; however, King never made this contact. (By letter dated November 20,

1964, SA Charles S. Harding has remarked that when he attempted to contact King

to make the appointment requested by Mr. DeLoach, King and his staff completely

ignored the FBI even though they were told the request to talk to him was a matter

of utmost urgency.)

OTHER DIFFICULTIES OF ATLANTA OFFICE IN CONTACTING KING

On about July 18 to July 20, 1961, attempts were made to make an

appointment with King to interview him in connection with the special inquiry investi-

gation of Theodore Edward Brown for the Peace Corps. On July 19th or July 20th,

MS 55234 DOCId: 32959657

## Page 49

King's secretary stated that "Dr. King can see you on Saturday afternoon but you

don't work Saturdays, do you?". His secretary was advised that the Agent would be

at King's office any time King would be available. A definite appointment was made

for 2 p.m. Saturday afternoon, July 22, 1961. The Agent appeared at King's office

at approximately 1:50 p.m., where he waited for an hour before being admitted to

King's office. King stated he was sorry to keep the Agent waiting but he was behind

in his paper work and had completed some of it before admitting the Agent.

In June, 1962, efforts were made to obtain an appointment with

King in connection with a case involving Shirley Blackwell Cummings, a Peace

Corps applicant. Beginning on approximately June 5, 1962, King's secretary kept

stating that he was not available for interview although it was known to us that he

was in his office daily. On June 8, 1962, Wyatt T. Walker, King's assistant,

advised the Atlanta Office that he and King were proceeding to Shreveport, Louisiana,

in connection with the voter registration drive and that the Little Union Baptist Church

in Shreveport had received a bomb threat. At that time, Walker was informed that

Agents had been urgently trying to make an appointment with King, and Walker stated

an appointment would be made. On June 8, 1962, King telephoned the Atlanta Office

from Shreveport to inquire as to why the Agent wanted an appointment and to advise

of the bomb threat previously furnished by Walker. King consented to interview

which was conducted June 9, 1962.

After being unable to contact King on July 23, 1962, the Atlanta Office

interviewed him the next day in connection with racial incidents at Albany, Georgia,

involving alleged violation by King of a temporary restraining order issued by the

U. S. District Court to stop demonstrations. The interview was conducted in the

U. S. courtroom where King had appeared for a hearing.

On June 25, 1963, the Atlanta Office attempted to contact King to

advise him of a threat against his life. Efforts to contact him were at first

unsuccessful, but after a delay of some hours, King's secretary informed him of

the Bureau's interest in talking to him and arrangements were made for an Agent to

contact King by telephone. (It will be recalled that in connection with other threats

against King's life, the Jackson Office was instructed in July, 1964, to provide

coverage during King's visit to Mississippi. They performed this assignment in

line with a request from the President; and, interestingly, Sheriff Lawrence A. Rainey

of Neshoba County, Mississippi, wrote to the Director on July 28th to inquire about

the authority by which FBI Agents furnished protection to King during King's visit to

Philadelphia, Mississippi, on July 24, 1964.

The. Bureau recommended that Rainey's

letter not be answered, after a copy of it had been received by the White House and

subsequently referred to our attention. )

on the part of law enforcement officers and spurs these officers to

immediately and vigorously investigate civil rights situations that

otherwise might be ignored.

Liaison with Governors and ranking state officials

has also been effective. Also, although we may not have jurisdiction

in a particular case the cooperative facilities of the FBI Laboratory

and Identification Division are made available.

It is also noted that on July 10, 1964, the Director

traveled to Jackson, Mississippi, to open a new FBI office in that

city. With this office, we feel we can more efficiently and effectively

meet our growing re vonsibilities.

There®

more recent specific

ows thumbnail sketches of some of the FBI's

mplishments in the civil rights field.

Racial Discriminatior

simidation of Voters

Under the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960, the

Attorney General was empowered to institute civil actions seeking

injunctive relief against racial discrimination and intimidation in

voting. We have conducted investigations under these acts in 168

counties in six southern states. As a result, 67 suits have been

filed in the States of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana,

Mississippi and South Carolina. As a result of suits filed based

on our investigations into discrimination and intimidation in

voting, thousands of previously disentranchised Negro citizens

have been enabled to register for voting.

Assaults Upon Voter: Registration Workers in Mississippi

Rabbi Arthur Joseph Lelyveld and two other white

voter registration workers were assaulted by two white men in

Hattiesburg, Mississippi, on June 10, 1964. Local authorities

were furnished the results of our investigation which identified

two local white men who perpetrated the assault. The subjects

were prosecuted on charges of assault and battery, fined $500

each and each was sentenced to 90 days in jail. The jail sentences

were suspended pending good behavior.

## Page 51

Iwo white civil rights workers accompanied by a young

Negro were assaulted in Jackson, Mississippi, on July 22, 1964. FBI

investigation identified a local Klansman as having struck one of the

victims with a club. Results of our investigation were furnished to

local authorities. The subject pleaded guilty to local assault charges

and was fined $50.

Three voter registration workers were intimidated and

one was assaulted at Itta Bena, Mississippi, on June 25, 1964. FBI

Agents arrested three local white men on June 26, 1964, for violation

of Federal Civil Rights Statutes. A Federal Grand Jury at Oxfora,

Mississippi, considered this case on July 17, 1964, but failed to indict

although the intimidation and the identities of the subjects were clearly

established.

Civil Rights Act of 1964

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 added tremendously to the

work of the FBI. Approximately 1, 800 reports and memoranda con-

cerning alleged violations have been prepared by FBI Agents since the

Act became effective on July 2, 1964.

Based on extensive FBI investigations, a three judge

Federal Court in Atlanta, Georgia, found the Act Constitutional and

enjoined the Pickrick. Restaurant and the Heart of Atlanta Motel from

racial discrimination. The Heart of Atlanta Motel case has been heard

by the Supreme Court and a decision is expected momentarily. Another

case which has been heard by the Supreme Court involves a restaurant

in Birmingham (Ollie McClung Case) which case was heard by a three

judge Federal Court and the Act was ruled unconstitutional, regarding

this specific restaurant. A decision is expected momentarily on this

case also and on the decision of this case and the Heart of Atlanta Motel

Case rests the fate of the effect of the Civil Rights Act. Based on FBI

investigations, suits have been filed against restaurants and motels in

Florida and numerous restaurants in Alabama that discriminate.

Additional court actions are anticipated in South Carolina, Georgia and

Alabama.

A federal suit now pending seeks to restrain the Mayor of

Greenwood, Mississippi, and other public officials from interfering

with the right of Negroes to attend a theater and for failing to provide

adequate police protection in the operation of a theater.

On July 23,1964, three white men, Willie Amon Belk,

his son, Jimmy Allen Belk, and Sam Allen Shaffer, JI., were arrested

by FBI Agents at Greenwood, Mississippi, on charges of conspiracy to

violate the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The arrests followed a thorough,

NW 55234

## Page 52

intensive and immediate investigation concerning the beating of Silas

McGhee, which occurred on July 16, 1964. The facts in this matter

will be presented to a Federal Grand Jury in January, 1965.

School Integration Matters

During August and September, 1964, the FBI investigated

desegregation of public schools in 18 possible trouble spots in southern

states. In connection with these investigations, we determined plans or

activities of Klan and other hate groups which might have interfered

with desegregation or resulted in acts of violence, and this information

was disseminated to local authorities.

Three Civil Rights Workers Murdered

The FBI conducted an all-out investigation concerning the

disappearance of Michael Schwerner and two other civil rights workers

in the vicinity of Philadelphia, Mississippi, on June 21, 1964. The

victims' burned-out automobile was located by FBI Agents on June 23,

1964, and the bodies of the three murdered victims were found in an

earthen dam on August 4, 1964. Arising out of this investigation the

FBI established other civil rights violations and on October 2, 1964,

a special Federal Grand Jury returned indictments against Sheriff

Lawrence Andrew Rainey and three other local law enforcement officers

and a former sheriff of Neshoba County, Mississippi. All five subjects

were arrested by FBI Agents and are awaiting trial on police brutality

charges not connected with the murders. While the FBI is certain as

to the identities of the subjects responsible for the murders of the three

civil rights workers, intensive investigation is being conducted to

develop suitable evidence.

Today (12-1-64) representatives of our

Civil Rights Section are discussing with Assistant Attorney General

Marshall possibilities of prosecution of the subjects regarding the

murders.

Murder of Lieutenant Colonel Lemuel A. Penn

On 7-11÷64 Lieutenant Colonel Lemuel A. Penn was

murdered near Colbert, Georgia. FBI investigation resulted in the

arrest of our subjects by FBI Agents on 8-6-64. Complete details

of FBI investigation were made available to the State for prosecution

of the subjects on murder charges. Two of the subjects were acquitted

in local court on 9-4-64; a third subject has not yet been tried in local

court but is still under indictment for murder and the local case against

the fourth subject has been dismissed.

On 10-16-64 indictments were returned by the Federal

Grand Jury at Athens, Georgia, charging six men with conspiracy to

injure, oppress, threaten and intimidate Negro citizens in the free

exercise and enjoyment of rights and privileges secured to them by the

Constitution. These individuals were Denver Willis Phillips, George

Hampton Turner, Herbert Guest, Cecil William Myers, Joseph Howard

Sims and James S. Lackey. Guest, Lackey, Myers and Sims were

the four men arrested by the FBI in connection with the murder of Penn.

A second indictment on 10-16-64 charges juest with possession of a

shotgun having an over-all length of less than 26 inches which had not

been registered by Guest with the Secretary of Treasury or his delegate.

All except Lackey were arraigned 11-30-64 on a Federal indictment-

pleas of not guilty rendered to the charges. Trial is set for 1-11-65.

Bombing of Home of Iona Godfrey

FBI investigation established that William Sterling

Rosecrans, Jr., a 30-year-old Klansman, had participated in the home

bombing of Iona Godfrey, a Negro'in Jacksonville, Florida, on 2-16-64.

Godfrey's six-year-old son was attending a white school under a Federal

Court Order.

Rosecrans pleaded guilty to obstructing a court order and

was sentenced on 4-17-64 to seven years by the U.S. District Court.

Five other Klansmen, who allegedly were involved in the bombing, were

also arrested by FBI Agents, but one of these subjects was acquitted

in U.S. District Court and the jury was unable to reach a verdict

regarding the other four. Retrial of latter four began November 16, 1964,.

and resulted in acquittal of all four on 11-25-64.

Bombings in McComb, Mississippi

Intensive FBI investigation was conducted in connection

with a series of bombings in the McComb, Mississippi, area from June

to September, 1964. Through the diligent efforts of the FBI and the

Mississippi Highway Patrol, nine white men were tried by Circuit

Court Judge W. H. Watkins at Magnolia, Mississippi, in connection

1.9

---

## Page 54

with charges that they were involved in bombings of homes and churches

at McComb. The nine entered pleas of guilty and nolo contendere. After

a 30 minute lecture Judge Watkins suspended their sentences and placed

all on probation. Judge Watkins, who was appointed by former Mississippi

Governor Ross R. Barnett, cited the defendants' youth and good families in

taking this action. He stated also that in committing these crimes they

had been "unduly provoked and undoubtedly ill advised." It may be noted

that four of the bombers were aged 44, 38, 36, and 35.

Murder of Two Negroes

Two Mississippi white men were arrested 11-6-64 in

connection with the murder of Henry Hezekiah Dee and Charlie Eddie

Moore, two Negroes from the Meadville, Mississippi, area.

The lower

portions of the bodies of these two Negroes were found in the Old River

backwater of the Mississippi River on 7-12 and 13, 1964. The white men,

James Ford Seale, aged 29; and Charles Marcus Edwards, aged 31, were

charged under warrants issued by Meadville Justice of the Peace Willie

Bedford, with willfully, unlawfully feloniously and with malice aforethought

killing the two Negroes on or about 5-2-64. Dee and Moore were last

seen alive on 5-2-64. One of the subjects, Edwards, is a self-admitted

Klansman®

Murder of Medgar Evers

In connection with the murder of Medgar Evers, a field

secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored

People on 6-12-63, Byron de la Beckwith is under state indictment.

Local prosecution is based upon an investigation which traced a rifle

which local authorities believed could have been the murder weapon to

Beckwith. The FBI traced the rifle's telescopic sight to Beckwith and,

further, identified a fingerprint found on the sight with Beckwith's. He

was tried twice (2-7-64 and 4-17-64) in State court, but jury could not

reach verdict in either case. Local district attorney has indicated he will

not try Beckwith again without new evidence.

possessing explosives. Rutledge was in possession of a large quantity

of dynamite and literature of the Ku Klux Klan at the time of his arrest.

The arrest resulted from information developed by the FBI which indicated

the dynamite was to be used to damage a building occupied in the Neshoba

County, Mississippi, area, by the Council of Federated Organizations.

The FBI immediately instituted an investigation following

a recent explosion adjacent to the Bishop Denis J. O'Connell High

School in Arlington, Virginia. The FBI obtained confessions implicating

three former students in the bombing and on 10-29-64, the three appeared

before an Arlington County Juvenile Judge. Two of the youths who were

aged 17 were found guilty of a misdemeanor and the third youth, aged 18,

was found guilty of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.

The three

subjects are awaiting sentence. The subjects were prosecuted locally as

there was no Federal violation.

On June 20, 1964, indictments were returned by the

Federal Grand Jury in Nashville, Tennessee, against seven officers of

the Nashville-Davidson County Sheriff's Office and the Rutherford County

Sheriff's Office. The indictments charged police brutality in violation of

a Federal civil rights statue and the officers are presently awaiting trial

in U. S. District Court, Nashville, Tennessee.

MARTIN LUTHER KING

APPOINTMENT WITH DIRECTOR

3:35 P.M., 12-1-64

jAt Reverend King's request, the Director met with Bing; Reverend Kapn

¿Abernathy, Secretary of the Southern Christian Leadership Conterence (SChC);

Dr. Andrew Young, Executive Assistant to King; and Walter Tauntroy, SCLO

representative here in Washington, at 3:35 p. mo, 12-1-64 in the Director's Office.

I met King and his associates in the hallway outside the Director's Office.

An attempt was made to rush them direcily through the reception room, however, King

slowly posed for the cameras and newsmen before proceedinge

i.:

Upon being introduced to the Director, Reverend King indicated his

appreciation for Mr. Hoover's seeing him then stated that Reverend Abernathy would

speak first, Reverend Abernathy told the Director it was a great privilege to meet the

distinguished Director of the FBI--a man who had done so much for his country.

Reverend Abernathy expressed the appreciation of the Negro race for the Director's

fine work in the field of civil rights. He stated that the Negroes had problems,

particularly in the South, and, therefore, had requested a discussion with the Director,

at the very time their people were continuing to "rise up from their bondage."

Reverend King spoke up. He stated it was vitally necessary to keep a

working relationship with the fBl. He wanted to clear up any misunderstanding which

might have occurred. He stated that some Negroes had told him that the FBI had been

ineffective, however, he was inclined to discount such criticism. Reverend King asked

that the Director please understand that any criticism of the Director and the fBI which

* had been attributed to King was either a misquote or an outright misrepresentatione He

stated this particularly concerned Albany,

Georgia, He stated that the only time he had

ever criticized the FBI was because of instances in which Special Agents who had been

given complaints in civil rights cases regarding brutality by police officere were seen

the following day being friendly with those same police officers. King stated this, of

course, promoted distrust inasmuch as the police sometir es "brutalized" Negroes.

Re: Martin Luther King, Appointment With Director, 3:35 p. Mo, 12-1-64

Reverend King stated he personally appreciated the great work of the FBI

which had been done in so many instances. He stated this was particularly true in

Mississippi. He added that FBI developments in that State have been very significant.

The EBlis a great restraining influence. Reverend King denied that he had ever stated

that Negroes should not report information to the FBL. He said he had actually encouraged

such reporting in many instances. He claimed there were good relationships in many

communities, especially Atlanta, Georgia, between Negroes and the FBI. He stated he

would continue to strongly urge all of his people to work closely with the FBI.

Reverend King stated he has never made any personal attack upon

Mr. Hoover. He stated he had merely tried to articulate the feelings of the Negroes in

the South in order to keep a tradition of nonviolence rather than violence. He added that

the Negro should never be transferred from a policy of nonviolence to one of violence and

terror.

Reverend King said that the Director's report to the President this summer

on rioting was a very excellent analysis.

Reverend King advised that Negroes are currently laboring under a very

frustrating situation. He stated that, "We sometimes are on the verge of temporary

despair." He added that it was a challenge and a duty for him to keep the Negro from

coming to a boiling point. He stated that sometimes the cries coming from the Negro

represent a real feeling of lonesomeness and despair. He, however, has pointed out that

the path to success is nonviolence rather than violence.

Reverend King stated he has been, and still is, very concerned regarding

the matter of communism in the civil rights movement. He stated he knew that the

Director was very concerned because he bore the responsibility of security in the Nation.

Reverend King stated that from a strong philosophical point of view he could never become

a communist inasmuch as he recognizes this to be a crippling totalitarian disease. He

stated that as a Christian he could never accept communism. He claimed that when ne

learns of the identity of 'communist in his midst he immediately deals with the problem

by removing this man. fle stated there have been one or two communists who were

engaged in fund raising for the SCLC. Reverend King then corrected himself to say that

these one or two men were former communists and not Party members at the present tim

He then identified "Jacky O'Dell" as an example. He stated that he had insisted that O'D^ll

leave his staff because the success of his organization, the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference, was far more important than friendship with O'Dell,

í...

The Director interrupted King to state that the FBI had learned from I.:

experience that the communists move in when trouble starts. The Director explain

communists thrive on chaos. The Director mentioned that his riot report to the Pr

reflected the opportunistic efforts of communists. He then stated that communist::.

no interest in the future of the Negro race and that King, of all people, should lie

this fact. The Director spoke briefly of communist attempts to infiltrate the lal. s

movement

Re: Martin Luther King, Appointment With Director, 3:35 p. mo, 12-1-64

The Director told King and his associates that the FBI shares the same

despair which the Negroes suffer when Negro leaders refused to accept the deep

responsibility they have in the civil rights movement, He stated that when Negroes are

encouraged not to cooperate with the FBI this sometimes frustrates or delays successful

solution of investigations. The Director told King that he had personally gone to

Mississippi to meet with Governor Paul Johnson inasmuch as there had been practically

no liaison between the Department of Justice, the President and the State of Mississippi

beforehand. The Director stated that upon meeting Governor Johnson the Governor

explained honestly that he was a segregationist, however, abhorred violence. The

Director stated that he had told Governor Johnson they had a common meeting ground

inasmuch as he was in Mississippi to put an end to violence and brutality. The Director

told Governor Johnson that he would like to do this in collaboration with the State Police,

however, if the FBI could not receive such cooperation we would do it on our own. The

Director then made reference to watermoccasins, rattlesnakes and redneck sheriffs, in

that order, who still exist in Mississippi who represent the trashy type of characters who

are promoting civil rights violations. The Director told King that we had trained twenty

representatives of the Mississippi State Highway Patrol and that this had represented a

good move to promote better cooperation and solution of civil rights cases.

The Director told Reverend King that the FBI had put the "fear of God" in

the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) He told King that we knew of the identity of the murderers of

the three civil rights workers and that these murderers would soon be brought to trial.

The Director then spoke of the terror in Mississippi backwoods and of the fact that

sheriffs and deputy sheriffs participate in crimes of violence, He summarized by telling

King that we, therefore, are under the same strain that sincere Negro leaders are under.

The Director added that the KKK constantly damns the FBI and that we have currently

been classified as the "Federal Bureau of Integration" in Mississippi.

The Director told King that many cases, which have been brought about as

a result of FBI investigation, must be tried in State Court. He spoke of the difficulty in

obtaining a verdict of guilty in instances in which white juries are impaneled in cases

involving white men.

The Director spoke of the KKK involvement in the Lemuel Penn cas

just outside of Athens, Georgia. He stated this was an outrageous miscarriage of justice

in that the defendants, despite the open and shut evidence on the part of the FBI, had been

acquitted.

The Director made it clear to Reverend King and his associates that the

FBI could not state whether a conviction would be obtained or not in the case involving i:.

murdered three civil rights victims. He stated, however, that the FBI has excelleilt

evidence in this case. The Director then explained that it was most necessary for ti

FBI not to "jump the gun" unless we had sufficient evidence in which a case could be

brought to trial.

Re: Martin Luther King, Appointment With Director, 3:35 Do Mo, 12-1-64

The Director made reference to Reverend King's allegation that the FBI

deals or associates with law enforcement officers who have been involved in civil rights

violations. He stated emphatically that, "I'll be damned if the FBI has associated with

any of these people nor will we be associated with them in the future. " The Director

explained that the FBI, not only because of the very nature of the law but also because of

the background of our investigative employees, was in full sympathy with the sincere

aspects of the civil rights movement. He stated that the FBI constantly needs cooperation

and assistance in order to solve cases. He added that he made it a point, several years

ago, to transfer northern Special Agents to southern offices. He stated that, for the most

part, northern-born Agents are assigned civil rights cases in the South. The Director

added that he feels that our Special Agents, regardless of where they are born, will

investigate a case impartially and thoroughly. He mentioned, however, that it was unfair

to the Agent and the FBI to "have a strike against him" in that criúcism had been leveled

over the fact that southern Agents would not give Negroes a "fair shake." The Director

stated that such criticism was entirely unjustifiable and that no case had ever been brought

to our attention proving such a fact.

The Director made reference to the recent case in McComb, Mississippi,

in which nine men had been charged with burning churches and violence against Negrees.

He stated this again was a miscarriage of justice. He added that the judge's decision in

releasing the defendants because they had learned their lesson and were merely youths

was entirely wrong and that it cused some people to question where youth really began.

He explained that some of the defendants had been in their 40*s. The Director added that

a deal probably, of course, had been made, however, this would certainly not represent

any deterrent to future actions of violence by these men.

The Director explained that there is a great misunderstanding today among

the general public and particularly the Negro race as to what the FBI can and cannot do

In the way of investigations. The Director emphasized that the FBI cannot recommend

prosecution or declination of prosecution. He stated that Agents cannot make "on the spot'

arrests. He stated that the FBI merely investigates and then the Departmont of Justice

determines whether prosecution be entertained or not. The Director added that the

question is sometimes raised why prosecution is not scheduled sooner. He stated this,

of course, was not the responsibility of the FBI in any way whatsoever.

He pointed out

that our civil rights investigations are conducted in a very thorough and expeditious

manner once the Department has authorized such investigations.

The Director spoke of the FBI's successful penetration of the KKK. He

stated that the FBI has interviewed all members of the KKK in Mississippi and has

served notice to these members that if trouble occurs we plan to come to them first.

stated our penetration of the KKK has been as successful as the manner in which we

infiltrated the communists and the Soviet espionage services. He stated that our pi

in infiltrating the KKK has been so rapid that Klan members now suspect each ui.

are fighting among themselves. The Director mentioned that we have two conf • •

the killing of the three civil rights workers. He added that the Klan in Missis-l.

failed to meet for some time because the members of this organization are i,

as to the identity of FBI informants in their midst. The Director stated he had personally

been an enemy of the KKK for a long time.

He spoke of the FBI's case in Louisiana in the late 1920°s in which FBI

evidence successfully culminated in the conviction of the top Klan leader. He stated the

KKK fully concentrated on Negroes, Jews and Catholics, however, concentration now

is strictly on the Negro race.

The Director told the group that in the Lemuel Penn case the defendants

have recently been indicted and are to stand trial in Federal Court. He stated the trial

would begin sometime next week. He mentioned that the same defendants were

responsible for beating Negroes and participation in other acts of violence. The Director

added that the FBI's success in infiltrating the KKK has been so extensive that we now

sometimes know in advance what the KKK plans to do and take proventive measures

accordingly

The Director explained that in Alabama the FBI cannot deal with the

Highway Patrol because of the psychoneurotic tendencies of the Alabama Governor. He

statco that the State of Georgia has & yuu Guvernor and inat the Georgia Bureau oi

Investigation, while not comparable to the Mississippi Highway Patrol, has cooperated

with the FBI.

The Director told Reverend King and his associates that FBI

representatives have held several thousand law enforcement conferences in which

southern police officers have been educated as to civil rights legislation. He stated this

has clearly assisted law enforcement, particularly the FBI, however, admittedly, this

represents slow progress, but progress nevertheless. He added that this educational

campaign will be continued and that it will eventually take hold. The Director gave the

example of a Mississippi Sherift who recently broke a case as a result of FBI training.

The Director made it very clear to Reverend King and his associates that

FBI Agents conduct very thorough interviews in civil rights cases. He stated he would

like to know immediately it any of our Special Agents ever act in a supercilicus manner

or if they mishandle a complaint regarding civil rights. He stated that if the facts

reflect that our Agent is in the wrong he will be called on the carpet fast. The Director

asked that Reverend King or any of his representatives feel free to call the FBI at any

time they have such complaints.

The Director told Reverend King he desired to give him some advice.

stated that one of the greatest things the Negro leaders could accomplish would be to

encourage voting registration among their people. Another thing would be to educate :

people in the skills so that they could compete in the open market. The Director

mentioned several professions in which Negroes could easily learn skills. The l"

also told King he wanted him to know that registrars in the South were now mort ..

in their actions. He stated that there were less attempts now to prevent Negru..

registering inasmuch as the FBI is watching such actions very carefully. The Director

told Reverend King that the FBI was making progress in violations regarding

discrimination in eating places. He gave as a specific example a restaurant in Atlanta,

Georgia, in which surveillances have taken place to ascertain if out-Of-state cars are

being served at this particular resaurant. The Director stated he personally was in

favor of equality in eating places and in schools. He stated emphatically, however, he

was not in favor of taking Negro children 10 or 12 miles across town simply because

their parents wanted them to go to a school other than those in their specific

neighborhood.

The Director told Reverend King that in due time there will be a complete

change in the mores of community thinking in the United States regarding the racial

problem. He stated that meanwhile the FBI will continue to handle its responsibilities

in a thorough and impartial manner. He reiterated that the FBI cannot encourage

prosecution in Federal Court despite the fact that some local courtscannot be trusted. He

added that some judges cannot be trusted.

The Director praised the Georgia papers that declared the verdict of the

Penn case to be a travesty of justic. Hc added that the Jackson, Mississipi, pavers

had contained several editorials deploring violence against Negroes and participation in

church burnings. The same editorials declared this was no way to solve racial

problems. The Director stated that his statements made at a press conference in

Jackson, Mississippi, this summer to the effect that he was in Mississippi to see to it

that an end was put to the violence of bombings and burning churches had had some affect

upon backwoods terrorists.

The Director told King that he wanted to make it very clear that the

question is often raised as to whether the FBI will protect civil rights workers or Negroes

He stated that he has in the past and will continue to answer such questions on the basis

that the FBI does not have the authority nor the jurisdiction to protect anyone. He stated

that when the Department of Justice desires that Negroes be protected this is the

responsibility of U. S. Marshals. The Director reiterated that the FBI is strictly an

investigative agency and cannot and will not extend itself beyond legislated jurisdiction.

The Director repeated very emphatically that while our investigations are very definitely

thorough and impartial he wanted to state once again that if Reverend King or any of his

associates ever knew of a Special Agent showing bias or prejudice he wanted to know

about this matter immediately.

The Director explained that we have civil rights cases not only in the

South but also in the northern cities. He gave examples of New York and Chicago. It

stated that there have been some cases in Miami, Florida.

Re: Martin Luther King, Appointment with Director, 3:35 p.M., 12-1-64

The Director spoke once again of the necessity of the Negro educating

himself in order to compete in manual and professional skills. He mentioned the

example of a shoeshine boy in Miami, Florida, who turned out to be, after questioning

by the Director, a graduate of Howard University. This shoeshine boy, a Negro,

explained to the Director that he could not get a job above the level of shoeshine boy

because of the color of his skin. The Director stated this, of course, was wrong and

that under no circumstances did he, or anyone in the FBI, share the opinion that the

Negro, or any other race, should be kept down. The Director spoke of his pride in

Negro Agents and particularly mentioned Special Agent Aubrey Lewis, the former

Notre Dame track star who is currently assigned to the New York Division.

The Director spoke of a Miami Special Agent who was transferred to that

Office from Sto Louis. This Agent explained to the Director on one occasion that he was

first a little upset about being transferred to Miami because he felt that his race would

be against him. He stated, however, much to his surprise, that the white people in

Miami treated him with the greatest of courtesy while people of his own race referred to

him as a "fink" simply because he was a representative of law enforcement.

Reverend King interrupted the Director at this point and asked if this same

Negro Agent is still assigned to the Miami Division. The Director replied in the

aîfirmative. The Director stated that at a recent dinner Father Hesburgh, the President

of Notre Dame University, explained to the Director that his institution had difficulty

getting Negroes on the football team because their grades were never high enough. The

Director told Reverend King the same thing is true of Negroes who apply for the position

of Special Agent. He stated in most instances they lack the qualifications, however, WC

were very happy to hire any Negro who was qualified for the position. The Director told

Reverend King that we, of course, could not let down our qualifications simply because

of the color of a person's skin.

The Director told Reverend King and his associates that the problems that

he and the Negro leaders have is a mutual problem. He stated in most instances in civil

rights matters we have learned that "you are damned if you do and you are damned if you

don't. " The Director stated nevertheless the FBI would continue to do its job. He staied

that we additionally are very proud of 10 or 11 Indian Special Agents and of a number of

Special Agents who have Mexican blood in them. He stated that the color of a man's skin

makes no difference to the FBI whatsoever, however, we do merit the cooperation and

assistance of all groups and it is most unfair when these groups are taught not to

cooperate with the FBI.

The Director mentioned that he wanted to make it very plain that the FlI

will not tolerate any of our personnel being slapped around. He gave an example ui :

Lombardozzi case in New York where one of our Agents was jumped by five huti!

outside a church. He stated these hoodlums were immediately taught a lesson.

Director mentioned that in the war with hoodlums, for every man we lose we I...

Re: Martin Luther King, Appointment With Director, 3:35 p. Mo, 12-1-64

The Director proudly spoke of the ability of Agents to outshoot and

outfight hoodlums and other individuals who attempted to take advantage of our personnel.

He stated the KKK is afraid to "mix" with our Agents. He mentioned that the Klan was

"yellow." He stated they are brave as long as they have the majority with them but

afraid when they face an equal number.

The Director spoke of the Mack Charles Parker case in Poplarville,

Mississippi.

He stated that our evidence in this case had been turned over to Governor

Coleman, the then Governor of that State. He mentioned that Governor Coleman was a

decent type of individual who had immediately seen to it that a State Court received the

evidence contributed by the FBI. The Director mentioned that our evidence in this case

was excellent, however, the Grand Jury refused to indict the subjects involved in the

lynching of Parker.

The Director told Reverend King that in many instances our Agents have

been spit upon, they have been refused food and lodging and many things are done to

thwart hard-hitting investigations by the FBI. He stated that nevertheless we continue

to gather evidence in an expeditious and thorough manner.

Reverend Abernathy stated that the Negroes have a real problem in

tearing down the current system of segregated voting tests in the South. He stated it was

most important that there be kept alive in the Negro communities a ray of hope, He

stated that the Negro people should not be allowed to fall into an atmosphere of despair.

The Director explained that this was a very important point. He stated

that real progress has been made in higher wages, voting registration and housing

inatters. The Director pointed out, however, that such progress has not been

emphasized by the rabblerousers who constantly attempt to stir up the Negroes against

the whites. The Director gave as an example the communist,Epton in New York Citye

The Director stated that Epton is sometimes pointed to as a person the Negro should

emulate because of his militancy. The Director stated this was wrong and it is also

wrong to "mislead" Negroes.

Reverend Abernathy stated that the SCLC does not want Negroes like

Epton in their movement. He stated thai Reverend King, more than anyone else, has

prevented people like Epton and the Muslims from taking over the civil righs movement.

Reverend Abernathy stated that actually the Negroes are a part of the Federal

Government, therefore, anything that represents the Federal Government is an

encouragement to the Negro. He added that even the side of a post office building or a

Federal courtroom is an encouragement to the Negro. He mentioned that when a Negro

receives information that a case in which he has been brutally mistreated is gring tin

Federal Court he feels encouraged over the fact that he will get a fair trial. Rever::

Abernathy continued that the same problem is true when a Negro sees an FBI At

stated that the Negro feels open encouragement inasmuch as the FBI will not only

handle his case but will serve as a great deterrent to violence.

Re: Martin Luther King, Appointment With Director, 3:35 po Mo, 12-1-64

The Director stated that the KKK today is represented by common white

trash. He stated that the Klan was actually worse than the Communist Party inasmuch

as the Klan resorts to violence while the communists usually emulate termites in their

activities.

The Director reiterated that King and his associates should feel free to

call him at any time when they have knowledge of possible civil rights violations. King

replied that over the past few years he has noted amazing signs of progress in the civil

rights field. He stated he has been very surprised to see some communities comply

with the new civi rights statutes. He stated there still are some pockets of resistence

particularly in the South. He added that the SCL.C is planning to stimulate voting

registration activities in Selma, Alabama, in the near future. He mentioned that some

members of his organization have been successful in infiltrating this white community

and have learned there is a great potential for violence, in Selma

The Director interrupted King and briefly detailed five cases in which the

FBI has gathered evidence in Selma, Alabama. The Director identified these cases

fully, and specifically the case against sheriff James Clark. The Direcior mentioned

that these cases came about as a result of FBI investigation and that we were continuing

our investigations in Selma, Alabama. He mentioned that one case would come to trial

on December 9, 1964 The Director particularly made reference to the fact that we have

three excellent cases in Selma at the present time.

Reverend King inquired as to whether his representatives should notify,

the FBI when they arrive in Selma, Alabama. He quickly corrected himself that he knew

his representatives should contact the FBI upon arrival, however, he asked the Director

what would be the possibilities of FBI Agents being in Selma, Alabama, inasmuch as

there appeared to be a potential for violence. The Director specifically asked Reverend

*King when his activities would take placè. Reverend Abernathy indicated such activity

would take place around January 1, 1960e The Director Clearly explained that FBI

Agents would be in Selma, not for the purpose of "protecting" anyone, but for the

'purpose of observing and reporting to the Department of Justice any possible violations

of civil rights that might occur. Reverend King expressed appreciation in this regard.

Reverend King stood up and stated he wished to express his personal

thanks for a most fruitful and necessary meeting. The Director told Reverend King that

he should get in touch with us at anytime he felt it was necessary.

Reverend King mentioned that there were representatives of the press in

the Director's reception room. He turned to me and asked if the FBI planned to make

any comment regarding the meeting. I told him that the Director had instructed that we

make no comment whatsoever. Reverend King asked the Director if there would be any

objections if he read a short prepared statement to the press. The Director told

Reverend King this, of course, was up to him.

In proceeding to the reception room, Reverend King pulled out a press

release, hand-written in ink, out of his right coat pocket. This press release obviously

had been prepared prior to the time Reverend King arrived at FBI Headquarters. A

previous memorardum has been sent through reporting verbatim the comments by King

in the Director's reception room.

ACTION:

It is suggested that the attached letter be sent to the President concerning

the meeting between the Director, Reverend King and his associates.

The General Investigative Division, Civil Rights Section, should take

due note of the proposed activities in Selma, Alabama, and should instruct the

appropriate office to make certain that Agents are on hand to observe activities in Selma,

Alabama, on or around January 1, 1965.

Reverend King categorically denied ever having made

Negroes not to cooperate with the rEl. I told him that when Negroes

are encouraged not to cooperate with the FEI, the solution of cases

is delayed and cometimes frustrated. He said, to the contrary, he

encouraged such cooperation. He explained that Negroes in many

areas are frustrated. He said he feels it is his duty to keep them

The problems confronting the FEI in civil rights

investigations were explained to the Reverend King in detail. I

made it clear to him that cases developed as a result of fBI

investigation must often be trie in local courts where there ere

attficulties involved in getting white juries to convict white

detendants in connection with civil rights matters. I cited some of

our experiences in this regard.

He and his associates were advised of the recent

conferences held for local law enforcement officers throughout the

United states for the purgose of tully acquainting them with civi. rights

legislation and their responsibilities in connection with same. I told

him that the results of this campaign have been encouraging in the

• cooperation received.

I pointed out to him that there is a great misunderstanding

today among the general pubite and particularly the Negro race as to

the FBl'& role in civil rights matters. I emphasized that the FBI is an

on-the-spot arrests where Federal laws have not been violated. He

was advised that the FBI will not protect civil righte workers or

Negroes because the FBI does not have the authority or jurisdction

to do so. He was also advised that the FBI cannot and will not

exceed its authority. Reverend King was told that our investigations.

are conducted in a thorough and impartial manner, but if he or any of

his associates knew of a Special Agent who had shown bias or prejuäice,

I wanted to know about it immediately.

Reverend King indicated that the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference is planning to engage in voter registration

activities in Selma; Alabama, on or about January 1, 1965, and that

he as learned that there could be violence. I told him that our Agents

MR. ROSEN

Acting Attorney General Nicholas deB. Katzenbach

returned my earlier call to him and I edvised him that I bad

seen Dr. Martin Luther King, who was accompanied by

Dr. Abernathy and two other cohorts. I stated that King was a

very persuasive speaker and Mr. Katzenbach indicated King

was a great public speaker and that was about all he could say

for King.

I advised Mr. Katzenbach that I took the ball away

from Fing at the beginning, that King was most laudatory about

the Bureau's work and so was Abernathy. I further advised

Mr. Katzenbach that King had a press statement already written

out to hand the newemen in my reception room; that I refused

to mate any comment or statement myself; that King read his

statement about having an open channel of communications and

all working for civil rights. I stated that King did not 'have in

his press statement the very commendatory remarka he made,

that he could not have been higher in hia praise of the Sureau

and of the great job we have done in the South. Mr. Batzenbach

said that was too bad.

I told IVir. Katzenbach that I just wanted him to

snow that I had gone through with it.

Ms. Katzenbach then asked ll I were going to tell

the President about the situation in Mississippi - about the

arrests - at some point. I answered yes, and Me. Katzenbach

sald the President should be informed. I advised him that we

had not decided when it was be done,

that it is boing considered.

REGARDING DIRECTOR'S MEETING

WITH REVEREND MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

12-1-64

The Director's meeting with King yesterday at 3:30 p.m. was a headline

item on television and radio newscasts last night and this morning.

and

Agents of the Crime Records Division monitored local radio and television

stations/noted that the first mentions of the meeting began to appear about 6:20 last night

on radio. The reports covered these main points: that King advised he had requested

this meeting, that it was most amicable, that "new understandings" had been reached. and

that the FBI expected to make arrests shortly in the case of the three murdered civil

rights workers in Mississippi. Some reporters speculated that the arrests might involve

persons in "official capacities. "

The meeting was covered on 11 o'clock newscasts on all local television,

channels which showed films of King leaving the Director's Office and commenting on y

the points noted above.

IDT

FULTON LEWIS, JR., BROADCAST:

In Mr. Lewis' 7 o'clock radio newscast over the Mutual Broadcasting

System, he reported the meeting as above. Then he continued to comment for several

minutes regarding the background of this matter. He said that on the record, the situa- &

tion must be embarrassing to King. He pointed out that King's allegations that FBI

Agents in Southern offices were, for the most part, Southerners and unsympathetic to

civil rights had been refuted. He said that Mr. Hoover had attempted unsuccessfully

c.

two years ago to discuss these matters with King. He went on to state that the FBI can- {

not offer protection since its function is solely to investigate.

As an example of FBI

jurisdiction, Mr. Lewis noted that in a Dawson, Georgia, church burning some time ago,

the FBI, as a result of excellent investigative work, arrested four subjects. The arrests

vete based bethe sup tate at the church burning was des et to intimidate Negro

stepped out of the case and the subjects were prosecuted in state court where they re-

ceived prison terms.

'M. A. Jones to DeLoach memo

RE: RADIO AND TELEVISION COVERAGE

Mr. Lewis pointed out that the FBI has numerous problems in connection

with these cases because of the reluctance of Southern juries to fairly evaluate the

evidence. As an example, he cited the case of William Rosecrans who was convicted

in a Jacksonville, Florida, bombing matter. As an outgrowth of this case, other

individuals were indicted for the same crime and, in spite of overwhelming evidence

against them, they were acquitted by a local jury just last week.

CHARLES MURPHY, NATIONAL BROADCASTING COMPANY (NBC) COMMENTATOR:

Following the 11 o'clock regular news report on WRC-TV, Murphy

offered an editorial comment concerning this meeting. He said that "King came and

turned the other cheek." and that this was in keeping with the character of a man who

was noted for peaceful purposes and who was a Nobel prize winner. He said that it was

not possible to imagine "J. Edgar Hoover going to King" under similar circumstances.

Murphy said that King had certainly enhanced his position in the way he handled this

matter. He also alleged that it was evident that President Johnson had asked the Direcier

to see King and it was only for this reason that the meeting materialized.

RECOMMENDATION:

In view of Mr. Lewis' remarks, that the attached letter of appreciation

over the Director's signature be sent to him.

Following is a transcript of the brief statement which the Reverend

Martin Luther King made to newsmen immediately after leaving the Director's Office

this afternoon. While this is not a verbatim account of the statement, it is as near

accurate as possible:

I am pleased I had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Hoover

this afternoon and I might say the discussion was quite amicable. I

sought to make it clear to Mr. Hoover that the plight of Negroes in

the South is such that there must not be any misunderstanding between

the FBI and civil rights leaders but must be a determination to defend

the riglis ul all.

We talked specifically about those areas where SCLC will be

working in the months ahead. We discussed areas where there will

be strong resistance to the implementation of the civil rights bill.

We made it clear that we found our most difficult problems in Alabama

and Mississippi and in these communities there are areas where we

see a great deal of potential and sometimes actual terror.

I sincerely hope we can forget the confusion of the past and get

on with the job the Congress, the Supreme Court and the President

have outlined as America's most crucial problem; namely, the job of

giving and providing security and justice to all the people in the world.

NBC's Russ Ward and one of the NBC men equipped with a tape recorder

followed King down the hall and on through the courtyard where his car was parked.

According to the NBC technician,

King was talking with them all the time." He said that

King expressed "the usual pratter" and the only statement of any consequence was

something to the effect that arrests in the Mississippi murder case could be expected

within the next few days.

! Time's Version of Hoover Meeting

ATLANTA,

Aug. (UPI) -

Three members of the Rev.

Dr. Martin Luther King's staff

who say they attended a meet-

ing between

Mr. King and

FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover

denied today a Time Mag-

azine report that the Director

confronted the civil rights

leader with wiretap evidence

of extra-marital activities.

Coretta S. King, in a sepa-

rate staiement,

aisú deniedi

the Time story which said

Dr. King toned down criticism

of the FBI only after Hoover

The statement issued joint-

ly by. the three men said, "It

that Dr. King slowed down

his activities because he felt

threatened. History is the wit-

ness here."

In

Chicago,

Jackson, national director of

NEW YORK, Aug. 9 (AP);

Time

magazine

says

FBI

Director J. Edgar Hoover con-

fronted

the late Dr. Martin

Luther King Jr. in 1964 with

some wiretaps

revealing Dr.

King's alleged extramarital ac-

tivities; and the Civil Rights

leader

later toned down his

criticism of the FBI.

Williams quotes one anony-

mous • source as

telling him

that King used a code. "A very

attragtive

woman was called

'Doctor,'" the

informant is

quoted as having said. "I for-!

get

the

other

names for

women not so attractive.

Time says "most newspapers

ignored the rumors and leaks

to them of King's extramarital

activities, but their existence

undermined King's effective-

ness justthe same."

"The effect, says Williams,

was one of slow politicaljassas-

sination; King was spailed it

onl' by the bullet of James

Earl Ray," Time said.

Ray pleaded guilty to killing

Dr. King in 1069.

In presenting its version of

the

Hoover-King

meeting,

Time said:

"Williams has the correct

outline of the FBI tape story.

What he does not have is pre-

cisely what happened at the

celebrated meeting

between

FBI Director Hoover and King

in 1964.

Time says Williams reports

that the surveillance uncov-

Memorandum to Mr. W. C. Sullivan

RE: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN RACIAL MATTERS

Rustin went on to praise Wilkins for having gone to the top about this

"supposed effort" when he learned of it 3 days ago rather than having

just passed it along as James Farmer had done when Farmer learned of it.

In reply to Wachtel's question whether Wilkins had acted before Martin's

visit with the Director, Rustin answered "yes."

Wachtel then observed, "In other words, while we were talking

he (Wilkins) was already acting

and therefore this call of Martin's

(visit with Director) was like 'rapping ribbon'." Rustin answered,

"Right, and futhermore, if anything happens we have got a line from

here to California that will fall on them like a satellite,"

Wachtel and Rustin went on to

agree that what Roy Wilkins had

done was a "terrific thing" and that "J. Edgar Hoover will now pull

back his horns."

Rustin added that Wilkins had made a 3rd point,

namely that "when a society has produced a Martin Luther King, to

permit anything to malign him is to undermine the morality in this

nation."

Wachtel said this was a great statement and wished "there

was nothing there that did undermine the morality."

Rustin also commented that the "gal on Long Island had been

contained" and that he had had lunch with Clarence Jones. He concluded

by stating, 'We've got to help people be careful man."

Referring to the HUMPHraY announcement to attend

announcement as

BAYARD replied,

"Ooviously."

WACHTEL said the air was

cleared, and "I think there should be some publicity

about it: CLEVE (CLEVELAND ROBINSON) ss going to put

it on the posters."

RUSTIN

said CLEVE was operating

in a very devious

way, and "I'm territed."

In reply to

a question of wAChTEl as to what this meant, RUSTIN said

he (CLiVE) had refused to hire any people, and was trying

to do it all by himself wich people fron vocal 05, some

MARTIN LUTHER KING

APPOINTMENT WITH DIRECTOR

3:35 P. Mo, 12-1-64

At Reverend King's request, the Director met with King; Reverend Rälph

Secretary of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC);

Tr. Andrew young, Executive Assistant to King; and Walter Wauntroy, SCLC

representative here in Washington, at 3:35 p.m., 12-1-64, il the Director's Office.

I met King and his associates in the hallway outside the Director's Office:

An attempt was made to rush them directly through the reception room, however,

- King

slowly posed for the cameras and newsmen before proceeding.

41

Upon being introduced to the Director, Reverend King indicated his

appreciation for Mr. Hoover's seeing him then stated that Reverend Abernathy would

speak first. Reverend Abernathy told the Director it was a great privilege to meet the

distinguished Director of the FBI--a man who had done so much for his country.

Reverend Abernathy expressed the appreciation of the Negro race for the Director's

fine work in the field of civil rights.

He stated that the Negroes had problems,

particularly in the South, and, therefore, had requested a discussion with the Director

at the very time their people were continuing to "rise up from their bondage."

Reverend King spoke up. He stated it was vitally necessary to keep a

working relationship with the t'bl. he wanted to clear up any misunderstanaing which

might have occurred. He stated that some Negroes had told him that the FBI had been

ineffective, however, he was inclined to discount such criticism. Reverend King asked

that the Director please understand that any criticism of the Director and the FBI which

had been attributed to King was either a misquote or an outright misrepresentation.

He

stated this particularly concerned Albany, Georgia. He stated that the only time he had

ever criticized the FBI was because of instances in which Special Agents who had been*

given complaints in civil rights cases regarding brutality by police officere were seen

the following day being friendly with those same police officers. King stated this, of

course, promoted distrust inasmuc as the police some tires "brutalize Negroes.

Re: Martin Luther King, Appointment With Director, 3:35 p. mo, 12-1-64

Reverend King stated he personally appreciated the great work of the FBI

which had bren done in so many instances. He stated this was particularly true in

Mississippi. He added that FBI developments in that State have been very significant,

The FBI is i great restraining influence. Reverend King denied that he had ever stated

that Negroc: should not report information to the FBI. He said he had actually encourag

such reporting in many instances. He claimed there were good relationships in many

communitic, especially Atlanta, Georgia, between Negroes and the FBI. He stated he

would continue to strongly urge all of his people to work closely with the FBI.

Reverend King stated he has never made any personal attack upon

Mr. Hoover. He stated he had merely tried to articulate the feelings of the Negroes in

the South in order to keep a tradition of nonviolence rather than violence. He added that

the Negro should never be transferred from a policy of nonviolence to one of violence anc

terror.

Reverend King said that the Director's report to the President this summe

on rioting wits a very excellent analysis.

Reverend King advised that Negroes are currently laboring under a very

frustrating situation. He stated that, "We sometimes are on the verge of temporary

despair." Il added that it was a challenge and a duty for him to keep the Negro from

coming to a boiling point.

He stated that sometimes the cries coming from the Negro

represent a real feeling of lonesomeness and despair. He, however, has pointed out that

the path to success is nonviolence rather than violence.

Reverend King stated he has been, and still is, very concerned regarding

the matter of communism in the civil rights movement. He stated he knew that the

Director was very concerned because he bore the responsibility of security in the Nation.

Reverend King stated that from a strong philosophical point of view he could never becom

a communist inasmuch as he recognizes this to be a crippling totalitarian disease. He

stated that as a Christian

he could never accept communism. He claimed that when he

learns of the identity of a communist in his midst he immediately deals with the problem

by removing this man. He stated there have been one or two communists who were

engaged in fund raising fox, the SCLC. Reverend King then corrected himself to say that

these one or livo men were former communists and not Party members at the present tim.

He then identllied "Jack O'Dell" as an example. He stated that he had insisted that O'Dell

leave his stali because the success of his organization, the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference, Was far more important than friendship with O'Deil.

The Director interrupted King to state that the FBI had learned from long

experience that the communists move in when trouble starts. The Director explained thai

communists thrive on chaos. The Director mentioned that his riot report to the President

reflected the opportunistic efforts of communists. He then stated that communists have

no interest in the future of the Negro race and that King, of all people, should be aware of

this fact. The Director spoke briefly of communist attempts to infiltrate the labor

movement. •

Re: Martin Luther King, Appointment With Director, 3:35 p.m., 12-1-64

The Director told King and his associates that the FBI shares the same

despair which the Negroes suffer when Negro leaders refused to accept the deep

responsibility they have in the civil rights movement. He stated that when Negroes are

encouraged not to cooperate with the FBI this sometimes frustrates or delays successful

solution of investigations. The Director told King that he had personally gone to

Mississippi to meet with Governor Paul Johnson inasmuch as there had been practically

no liaison between the Department of Justice, the President and the State of Mississippi

beforehand. The Director stated that upon meeting Governor Johnson the Governor

explained honestly that he was a segregationist, however, abhorred violence. The

Director stated that he had told Governor Johnson they had a common meeting ground

inasmuch as he was in Mississippi to put an end to violence and brutality. The Director

told Governor Johnson that he would like to do this in collaboration with the State Police,

however, if the FBI could not receive such cooperation we would do it on our own. The

Director then made reference to watermoccasins, rattlesnakes and redneck sheriffs, in

that order, who still exist in Mississippi who represent the trashy type of characters who

are promoting civil rights violations.

The Director told King that we had trained twenty

representatives of the Mississippi State Highway Patrol and that this had represented a

good move to promote better cooperation and solution of civil rights cases.

The Director told Reverend King that the FBI had put the "fear of God" in

the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). He told King that we knew of the identity of the murderers of

the three civil rights workers and that these murderers would soon be brought to trial,

The Director then spoke of the terror in Mississippi backwoods and of the fact that

sheriffs and deputy sheriffs participate in crimes of violence. He summarized by telling

King that we, therefore, are under the same strain that sincere Negro leaders are under.

The. Director added that the KKK constantly damns the FBI and that we have currently

been classified as the "Federal Bureau of Integration" in Mississippi.

The Director told King that many cases, which have been brought about as

a result of FBI investigation, must be tried in State Court. He spoke of the difficulty in

obtaining a verdict of guilty in instances in which white juries are impaneled in cases

involving white men. The Director spoke of the KKK involvement in the Lemuel Penn casi

just outside of Athens, Georgia. He stated this was an outrageous miscarriage of justice

in that the defendants, despite the open and shut evidence on the part of the FBI, had been

acquitted.

The Director made it clear to Reverend King and his associates that the

FBI could not state whether a conviction would be obtained or not in the case involving the

murdered three civil rights victims. He stated, however, that the FBI has excellent

evidence in this case. The Director then explained that it was most necessary for the

FBI not to "jump the gun" unless we had sufficient evidence in which a case could be

brought to trial.

Re: Martin Luther King, Appointment With Director, 3:35 p.m., 12-1-64

The Director made reference to Reverend King's allegation that the FBI

deals or associates with law enforcement officers who have been involved in civil rights

violations. He stated emphatically that, "I'll be damned if the FBI has associated with

any of these people nor will we be associated with them in the future. " The Director

explained that the FBI, not only because of the very nature of the law but also because of

the background of our investigative employees, was in full sympathy with the sincere

aspects of the civil rights movement. He stated that the FBI constantly needs cooperation

and assistance in order to solve cases. He added that he made it a point, several years

ago, to transfer northern Special Agents to southern offices. He stated that, for the most

part, northern-born Agents are assigned civil rights cases in the South. The Director

added that he feels that our Special Agents, regardiess of where they are born, will

investigate a case impartially and thoroughly. He mentioned, however, that it was unfair

to the Agent and the FBI to "have a strike against him" in that criticism had been leveled

over the fact that southern Agents would not give Negroes a "fair shake." The Director

stated that such criticism was entirely unjustifiable and that no case had ever been brougl

to our attention proving such a fact.

.

The Director made reference to the recent case in McComb, Mississippi,

in which nine men had been charged with burning churches and violence against Negroes.

He stated this again was a miscarriage of justice. He added that the judge's decision in

releasing the defendants because they had learned their lesson and were merely youths

was entirely wrong and that it caused some people to question where youth really began.

He explained that some of the defendants had been in their 40%s. The Director added that

a deal probably, of course, had been made, however, this would certainly not represent

any deterrent to future actions of violence by these men.

The Director explained that there is a great misunderstanding today amoig

the general public and particularly the Negro race as to what the FBI can and cannot do

in the way of investigations. The Director emphasized that the FBI cannot recommend

prosecution or declination of prosecution. He stated that Agents cannot make "on the spoi

arrests. He stated that the FBI merely investigates and then the Department of Justice

determines whether prosecution be entertained or not. The Director added that the

question is sometimes raised why prosecution is not scheduled sooner. He stated this,

of course, was not the responsibility of the FBI in any way whatsoever. He pointed out

that our civil rights investigations are conducted in a very thorough and expeditious

manner once the Department has authorized such investigations.

The Director spoke of the FBI's successful penetration of the KKK. He

stated that the FBI has interviewed all members of the KKK in Mississippi and has

served notice to these members that if trouble occurs we plan to come to them first.

He

stated our penetration of the KKK has been as successful as the manner in which we

infiltrated the communists and the Soviet espionage services. He stated that our progress

in infiltrating the KKK has been so rapid that Klan members now suspect each other and

are fighting among themselves.

The Director mentioned that we have two confessions in

the killing of the three civil rights workers. He added that the Klan in Mississippi has

failed to meet for some time because the members of this organization are apprehensive

as to the identity of FBI informants in their midst. The Director stated he had personall

been an enemy of the KKK for a long time.

He spoke of the FBI's case in Louisiana in the late 1920's in which FBI

evidence successfully culminated in the conviction of the top Klan leader. He stated the

KKK fully concentrated on Negroes, Jews and Catholics, however, concentration now

is strictly on the Negro race.

The Director told the group that in the Lemuel Penn case the defendants

have recently been indicted and are to stand trial in Federal Court He stated the trial

would begin sometime next week. He mentioned that the same defendants were

responsible for beating Negroes and participation in other acts of violence. The Director

added that the FBI's success in infiltrating the KKK has been so extensive that we now

sometimes know in advance what the KKK plans to do and take preventive measures

accordingly.

The Director explained that in Alabama the FBI cannot deal with the

Highway Patrol because of the psychoneurotic tendencies of the Alabama Governor.

He

stated that the State of Georgia has a good Governor and that the Georgia Bureau of

Investigation, while not comparable to the Mississippi Highway Patrol, has cooperated

with the FBI.

The Director told Reverend King and his associates that FBI

representatives have held several thousand law enforcement conferences in which

southern police officers have been educated as to civil rights legislation. He stated this

has clearly assisted law enforcement, particularly the FBI, however, adinittedly, this

represents slow progress, but progress nevertheless. He added that this educational

campaign will be continued and that it will eventually take hold. The Director gave the

example of a Mississippi Sheriff who recently broke a case as a result of FBI training,

The Director made it very clear to Reverend King and his associates that

FBI Agents conduct very thorough interviews in civil rights cases. He stated he would

like to know immediately if any of our Special Agents ever act in a supercilious manner

or if they mishandle a complaint regarding civil rights. He stated that if the facts

reflect that our Agent is in the wrong he will be called on the carpet fast. The Director

asked that Reverend King or any of his representatives feel free to call the FBI at any

time they have such complaints.

The Director told Reverend King he desired to give him some advice. He

stated that one of the greatest things the Negro leaders could accomplish would be to

encourage voting registration among their people. Another thing would be to educate their

people in the skills so that they could compete in the open market The Director

mentioned several professions in which Negroes could easily learn skills. The Director

also told King he wanted him to know that registrars in the South were now more careful

in their actions. He stated that there were less attempts now to prevent Negroes from

Re: Martin Luther King, Appointment With Director, 3:35 p. Mo, 12-1-64

registering inasmuch as the FBI is watching such actions very carefully. The Director

told Reverend King that the FBI was making progress in violations regarding

discrimination in eating places. He gave as a specific example a restaurant in Atlanta,

Georgia, in which surveillances have taken place to ascertain if out-of-state cars are

being served at this particular resaurant. The Director stated he personally was in

favor of equality in eating places and in schools. He stated emphatically, however, he

was not in favor of taking Negro children 10 or 12 miles across town simply because

their parents wanted them to go to a school other than those in their specific

neighborhood.

The Director told Reverend King that in due time there will be a complete

change in the mores of community thinking in the United States regarding the racial

problem. He stated that meanwhile the FBI will continue to handle its responsibilities

in a thorough and impartial manner. He reiterated that the FBI cannot encourage

prosecution in Federal Court despite the fact that some local courtscannot be trusted. He

added that some judges cannot be trusted.

The Director praised the Georgia papers that declared the verdict of the

Penn case to be a travesty of justice. He added that the Jackson, Mississippi, papers

had contained several editorials deploring violence against Negroes and participation in

church burnings. The same editorials declared this was no way to solve racial

problems. The Director stated that his statements made at a press conference in

Jackson, Mississippi, this summer to the effect that he was in Mississippi to see to it

that an end was put to the violence of bombings and burning churches had had some affect

upon backwoods terrorists.

The Director told King that he wanted to make it very clear that the

question is often raised as to whether the FBI will protect civil rights workers or Negroe

He stated that he has in the past and will continue to answer such questions on the basis

that the FBI does not have the authority nor the jurisdiction to protect anyone. He stated

that when the Department of Justice desires that Negroes be protected this is the

responsibility of U. S. Marshals. The Director reiterated that the FBI is strictly an

investigative agency and cannot and will not extend itself beyond legislated jurisdiction.

The Director repeated very emphatically that while our investigations are very definitely

thorough and impartial he wanted to state once again that if Reverend King or any of his

associates ever knew of a Special Agent showing bias or prejudice he wanted to know

about this matter immediately.

The Director explained that we have civil rights cases not only in the

South but also in the northern cities. He gave examples of New York and Chicago. He

stated that there have been some cases in Miami, Florida.

Re: Martin Luther King, Appointment with Director, 3:35 p.mo, 12-1-64

The Director spoke once again of the necessity of the Negro educating

himself in order to compete in manual and professional skills. He mentioned the

example of a shoeshine boy in Miami, Florida, who turned out to be, after questioning

by the Director, a graduate of Howard University. This shoeshine boy, a Negro,

explained to the Director that he could not get a job above the level of shoeshine boy

because of the color of his skin. The Director stated this, of course, was wrong and

that under no circumstances did he, or anyone in the FBI, share the opinion that the

Negro, or any other race, should be kept down. The Director spoke of his pride in

Negro Agents and particularly menticned Special Agent Aubrey Lewis, the former

Notre Dame track star who is currently assigned to the New York Division.

The Director spoke of a Miami Special Agent who was transferred to that

Office from St. Louis. This Agent explained to the Director on one occasion that he was

first a little upset about being transferred to Miami because he felt that his race would

be against him. He stated, however, much to his surprise, that the white people in

Miami treated him with the greatest of courtesy while people of his own race referred to

him as a "fink" simply because he was a representative of law enforcement.

Reverend King interrupted the Director at this point and asked if this same

Negro Agent is still assigned to the Miami Division. The Director replied in the

affirmative. The Director stated that at a recent dinner Father Hesburgh, the President

of Notre Dame University, explained to the Director that his institution had difficulty

getting, Negroes on the football team because their grades were never high enough. The

Director told Reverend King the same thing is true of Negroes who apply for the position

of Special Agent. He stated in most instances they lack the qualifications, however, we

were very happy to hire any Negro who was qualified for the position. The Director told

Reverend King that we, of course, could not let down our qualifications simply because

of the color of a person's skin.

The Director told Reverend King and his associates that the problems that

he and the Negro leaders have is a mutual problem. He stated in most instances in civil

rights matters we have learned that "you are damned if you do and you are damned if you

don't. " The Director stated nevertheless the FBI would continue to do its job. He stated

that we additionally are very proud of 10 or 11 Indian Special Agents and of a number of

Special Agents who have Mexican blood in them. He stated that the color of a man's skin

makes no difference to the FBI whatsoever, however, we do merit the cooperation and

assistance of all groups and it is most unfair when these groups are taught not to

cooperate with the FBI.

The Director mentioned that he wanted to make it very plain that the FBI

will not tolerate any of our personnel being slapped around. He gave an example of the

Lombardozzi

case in New York where one of our Agents was jumped by five hoodlums

outside a church. He stated these hoodlums were immediately taught a lesson, The

Director mentioned that in the war with hoodlums, for every man we lose we make

certain, through legal means of course, that the hoodlums lose the same number or more.

Re: Martin Luther King, Appointment With Director, 3:35 p. mo, 12-1-64

The Director proudly spoke of the ability of Agents to outshoot and

outfight hoodlums and other individuals who attempted to take advantage of our personnel.

He stated the KKK is afraid to "mix" with our Agents. He mentioned that the Klan was

"yellow." He stated they are brave as long as they have the majority with them but

afraid when they face an equal number.

The Director spoke of the Mack Charles Parker case in Poplarville,

Mississippi. He stated that our evidence in this case had been turned over to Governor

Coleman, the then Governor of that State. He mentioned that Governor Coleman was a

decent type of individual who had immediately seen to it that a State Court received the

evidence contributed by the FBI. The Director mentioned that our evidence in this case

was excellent, however, the Grand Jury refused to indict the subjects involved in the

lynching of Parker.

The Director told Reverend King that in many instances our Agents have

been spit upon, they have been refused food and lodging and many things are done to

thwart hard-hitting investigations by the FBI. He stated that nevertheless we continue

to gather evidence in an expeditious and thorough manner.

Reverend Abernathy stated that the Negroes have a real problem in

tearing down the current system of segregated voting tests in the South. He stated it was

most important that there be kept alive in the Negro communities a ray of hope.. He

stated that the Negro people should not be allowed to fall into an atmosphere of despair.

The Director explained that this was a very important point. He stated

that real progress has been made in higher wages, voting registration and housing

matters.

The Director pointed out, however, that such progress has not been

emphasized by the rabblerousers who constantly attempt to stir up the Negroes against •

the whites. The Director gave as an example the communist, Epton in New York City»

The Director stated that Epton is sometimes pointed to as a person the Negro should

emulate because of his militancy. The Director stated this was wrong and it is also

wrong to "mislead" Negroes.

Reverend Abernathy stated that the SCLC does not want Negroes like

Epton in their movement. He stated that Reverend King, more than anyone else, has

prevented people like Epton and the Muslims from taking over the civil righs movement.*

Reverend Abernathy stated that actually the Negroes are a part of the Federal

Government, therefore, anything that represents the Federal Government is an

encouragement to the Negro. He added that even the side of a post office building or a

Federal courtroom is an encouragement to the Negro. He mentioned that when a Negro

receives information that a case in which he has been brutally mistreated is going to

Federal Court he feels encouraged over the fact that he will get a fair trial. Reverend

Abernathy continued that the same problem is true when a Negro sees an FBI Agent. He

stated that the Negro feels open encouragement inasmuch as the FBI will not only fairly

handle his case but will serve as a great deterrent to violence. '

Re: Martin Luther King, Appointment With Director, 3:35 p. mo, 12-1-64

The Director stated that the KKK today is represented by common white

trash. He stated that the Klan was actually worse than the Communist Party inasmuch

as the Klan resorts to violence while the communists usually emulate termites in their

activities.

The Director reiterated that King and his associates should feel free to

call him at any time when they have knowledge of possible civil rights violations. King

replied that over the past few years he has noted amazing signs of progress in the civil

rights field. He stated he has been very surprised to see some communities comply

with the new civi rights statutes. He stated there still are some pockets of resistence

particularly in the South. He added that the SCIC is planning to stimulate voting

registration activities in Selma, Alabama, in the near future.

He mentioned that some

members of his organization have been successful in infiltrating this white community

and have learned there is a great potential for violence, in Selma.

The Director interrupted King and briefly detailed five cases in which the

FBI has gathered evidence in Selma, Alabama. The Director identified these cases

fully, and specifically the case against Sheriff James Clark, The Director mentioned

that these cases came about as a result of FBI investigation and that we were continuing

our investigations in Selma, Alabama. He mentioned that one case would come to trial

on December 9, 1964 The Director particularly made reference to the fact that we have

three excellent cases in Selma at the present time.

Reverend King inquired as to whether his representatives should notify

the f Bl when they arrive in Selma, Alabama. He quickly corrected himself that he knew

his representatives should contact the FBI upon arrival, however, he asked the Director

what would be the possibilities of FBI Agents being in Selma, Alabama, inasmuch as

there appeared to be a potential for violence. The Director specifically asked Reverend-

King when his activities would take place. Reverend Abernathy indicated such activity

would take place around January 1, 1965. The Director clearly explained that FBI

Agents would be in Selma, not for the purpose of "protecting" anyone, but for the

purpose of observing and reporting to the Department of Justice any possible violations

of civil rights that might occur. Reverend King expressed appreciation in this regard.

Reverend King stood up and stated he wished to express his personal

thanks for a most fruitful and necessary meeting. The Director told Reverend King that

he should get in touch with us at anytime he felt it was necessary.

Reverend King mentioned that there were representatives of the press in

the Director's reception room. He turned to me and asked if the FBI planned to make

any comment regarding the meeting. I told him that the Director had instructed that we

make no comment whatsoever. Reverend King asked the Director if there would be any

objections if he read a short prepared statement to the press. The Director told

Reverend King this, of course, was up to him.

Re: Martin Luther King, Appointment With Director, 3:35 p.m., 12-1-64

In proceeding to the reception room, Reverend King pulled out a press

release, hand-written in ink, out of his right coat pocket. This press release obviously

had been prepared prior to the time Reverend King arrived at FBI Headquarters. A

previous memorandum has been sent through reporting verbatim the comments by King

in the Director's reception room.

ACTION:

It is suggested that the attached letter be sent to the President concerning

the meeting between the Director, Reverend King and his associates.

The General Investigative Division, Civil Rights Section, should take

due note of the proposed activities in Selma, Alabama, and should instruct the

appropriate office to make certain that Agents are on hand to observe activities in Selma,

Alabama, on or around January 1, 1965.

being friendly toward these same officers. He said situatione like

this serve to breed Negro cistrust for the FBI. I advised

Reverend King that I was aware that allegations of this nature

had been made and that I had looked into the matter. It was

determined that these charges were without basis.

Reverend King categorically denied ever having made

a personal attack on me and also denied that he had ever instructed

Negroes not to cooperate with the FBI. I told him that when Negroes

are encouraged not to cooperate with the FBI, the solution a cases

is delayed and sometimes frustrated. He said, to the contrary, he

encouraged such cooperation. He explained that Negroes in many

areas are frustrated. He said he feels it is his duty to keep them

from expressing their frustrations through violence. Reverend King

made reierence to my report to you on the rioting that took place in

some of our northern eities last summer. He indicated he considers

it an excellent analysis of the situation.

Communist infiltration of the civil rights movement

was discussed. Reverend King stated that as a Christian he could

never accept communism and that he shared my concern with the

problem. He described communism as a "crippling, totalitarian

disease. " He said that while there are "one or two" former com-

munists currently engaged in lund-raising activities for the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference, he does not tolerate communists in

his organization. Te cited the communist background of Hunter Pitts

O'Dell and noted that he considered the success of the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference more important to him than his friendship with

O'Dell. Consequently, he claimed, O'Dell is no longer associated

with his organization.

The President

The preblems confronting the FBI in civil rights

investigations were explained to the Reverend King in detail. &

made it clear to him that cases developed as a resuli of FBI

investigation must often be tried in local courts where there are

difficulties involved in getting white juries to convict white

defenciants in connection with civil rights matters. I cited some of

our experiences in this regard.

He and his associates were advised of the recent

conferences held for local law enforcement officers throughout the

United states for the purpose of fully acquainting them with civil rights

legislation and their responsibilities in connection with same. I told

him that the results of this campaign have been encouraging in the

cooperation received.

I pointed out to him that there is a great misunderstanding

today among the general public and particularly the Negro race as to

the fRI's role in civil rights matters. & emphasized that the FBI is an

investigative agency, that it cannot recommend prosecution or maise

on-the-spot arrests where Federal laws have not been violated. He

was advised that the FSI will not protect civil rights workers or

Negroes because the FEI does not have the authority or jurisciction

to do so. He was also avised that the FBI cannot and will not

exceed its authority. Reverend King was told that our investigations

are conducted in a thorough and impartial manner, but it he or any of

his associates knew of a Special Agent who had shown bias of prejudice,

& wanted to know about it immediately.

Reverend King indicated that the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference is planning to engage in voter registration

activities in selma, Alabama, on or about January 1, 1955, and that

he has learned that there could be violence. I tola him that our Agents

would be on the scene, not for the purpose of rendering protection,

but to observe and report to the Department oi Justice any possible

violations of civil rights that may occur.

This is to advise you of another scurrilous attack

on the Director and the FBI by the SCLC, and to recommend a mass

At its Annual Convention in Atlanta, Georgia,

8/11 - 14/70, the SCLC adopted a resolution attacking the

Director and the FBI for "their attacks on Martin Luther King, JI.

and their failure to meet their responsibilities such as

protecting civil rights, stopping narcotics traffic and other

organized crime." Senator George McGovern (Democrat -

South Dakota) also alluded to the "venal attack" on King in

his address at the convention.

D.

Ness

This two-faced attack is the rankest hypocrisy.

The resolution was occasioned by an article in Time magazine

which accused the Director, during his meeting with King

on 12/1/64, of prescuring King to tone down his attacks.

against the FBI with tapes of King's immoral conduct. This

article was false and King's three SCLC associates who

accompanied him on 12/1/64 (including Ralph Abernathy, current

President of SCLC) all denied that the Director even mentioned

Kine's immoral; conduct. Now they turn around and allow a

resolution to be passed which in effect accuses the Director

of the same thing that they have already branded as a lie in

Ithe Time article.

OBSERVATIONS:

The history of this group indicates the deceitful

accusations will continue. After expressing confidence in

THE SOUTHERN

CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE'S

ATTACK, ON J. EDGAR HCOVER

Its most recent attack on Director J. Edgar Hoover

and the FBI certainly does not depict the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference as a responsible organization, a

picture which the organization needs to overcome its

reported financial dilemma. The latest attack was based on

an article in Time magazine alleging that Mr. Hoover

confronted Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. with tapes about

his immoral conduct and pressurea

Dr. King into toning

down his criticisms.of Mr. Hoover and the FBI. Three of

King's associates who accompanied Dr. King during his

meeting with Mr. Hoover

promptly denied that Mr. Hoover

even mentioned Dr. King's conduct during the neeting.

Mr. Hoover characteristically said nothing. This should

have laid to rest the situation once more.

Out in Chicago, Reverend Jesse Jackson, a

national

SCLC official touted by many as the successor to

Reverend Ralph Abernathy as President of the SCLC, felt

Ignoring the denials by his associates,

including Reverend Abernathy, Reverend Jackson launched a

bitter personal attack on Mi. Hoover, accusing him of

• to "whitemail" Dr. King. Then, the SCLC held its

National Convention in Atlanta, Georgia, and in a resolution

To add further confusion to just what Mr.

Hoover

was being accused of doing, the resolution noted that

Dr. King's three associates who also attended the meeting

vith Mr. Hoover had said the published reports

were

"absolutely not true."

This confusing action by the SCLC must make the

public wonder.

Surely they are trying to get all the

mileage they can from the situation but it seems this time

they have gone too fai, and Mr. Hoover comes out looking

better than ever for an avkard, contradictory, hypocritical

attack by a bunch of preachers who should know better, it

not as businessmen,

then surely as preachers.

This is the kind of thing the civil rights

movement can well do without. The shrieks of the extremists

in the racial situation should be counterbalanced by

responsibility and fairness.

This type of attack is clacly

counterproductive and, if the SCLC is to survive, must be

halted and halted fast.

STAFF WRITER

"'THE WASHINGTON POST AND TIMES HERALD"

Partie

Von Hoffman, a reporter who has been long identified with liberal and

New Left causes, wrote an article (copy attached) appearing in the 8-19-70 issue of

"The Washington Post and Times Herald, " which article attempts to: (1) defend the

moral character and leadership image of the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,

and (2) viciously discredit the FBI by suggesting that we blackmailed Dr. King.

Von-Hoffman's article stems from the controversy provoked by black

novelist John A:

Williams' recently published book, "The King God Didn't Save,"

Which alluded to Dr. King's vigorous, extra-marital sex life which information

"Time" magazine's issue of 8-17-70 contends was obtained by FBI wiretaps and

laterused by the Dircotor during their 1964 confrontatinn in lecture King and

suggest that he (King) "... tone down his criticism of the FBI." Associates of King

present with him during this meeting have, of course, publicly denied "Time's"

version of the discussion between the Director and King.

Using such blasphemous terms as "cop-God" to describe thel Director

¡ and such a scurrilous term as "girlie magazine cops" in referring to FBI Agents,

von Hoffman's article suggests that: (1) the Director maintains private dossiers

on

many prominent citizens who are thus afraid to challenge him; (2) that FBI investiga-

tion of King's assassination raises questions as to who may be the "unsought"

accomplice of James Earl Ray; (3) that an eye witness who disputed the identification

of James Earl Ray as the assassin has been locked-up in an insane asylum and;

(1) that by assisting in 'King's destruction," the Director has fostered much of

the violence that now besets the country. REC-32 60-113527-5

Von Hoffman's article is a pack of lies. This fact is best dramatized

by his reference to the witness he refers to as having seen someone other than

James Earl Ray running from the room where King's assassin fired. This witness

(Mrs. Grace Stephens), when interviewed by FBI Agents, stated that she was ill and

¡bedridden the entire day of King's assassination, which fact was confrimed by her

husband.

Writing in the June, 1970, issue of "Playboy" mao?

magazine, von Hottman;

in an article entitled "The Chicago Conspiracy Circus," quotes Rennie Davis, one of

the defendants in the Chicago trials, as saying the trial was controlled by police and

* Private Life or

U.S. Property?

A Commentary el

•By Nicholas von Hoffman

A decent regard for the family and friends of public

men has inhibited cops, journalists and biographers.

from publishing embarrassing material about their

private lives until after the principals have gone to

their graves.

This was the case with Benjamin Frank-

lin, Alexander Hamilton and so on through to Warren

Harding and Franklin Roosevelt, In life and in death

another rule has been used with Dr. Martin Luther

King Jr. Time after time we pick up the paper and

learn that he had a sex life, a rather ordinary one by

American standards, and not much different from many

other men of prominence. It wasn't what Dr. King may

have done in bed that made him the superior of so

many police chiefs, senators and presidents.

The newest furor over Dr. King's behavior as an

American male comes from a book by black novelist

John A. Williams. ("The King God Didn't Save," Coward-

McCann, New York, 1970, $5.95, and don't rush out to

buy it expecting sexy passages because there aren't

any.) In the book Mr. Williams says,

"As a black man,

•I do not have to ask why such 'barnyard gossip' was

lar activities of (deleted, President) or (deleted, Presi-

dent) or (deleted, prince) or (deleted, princess)?

. .

Anything black people set into motion is going

to be

monitored, anything, and then it possible compromised."

Elsewhere the writer accuses the government of clan-

destinely snapping pictures and tape recording episodes

in the civil rights leader's private life and then politic-

ally blackmailing him: "At some point along the way,

someone in the government let him (Dr. King) know

that he had been taped and photographed in situations

that might considered compromising by the Puriter.

masses. He was asked to soft-pedal his activities, to make

roborates Williams, Saying, "Hoover explained to King

This version of what happened at the 1964 King-

Hoover meeting is denied by some of Dr. King's asso-

ciates, although they say they're still having their phones

tapped. A number of newspapermen say that attempts

were made lo foist feelthy tape recordings on them.

Quite a picture that suggests. Mr. Hoover and/or his

in the executive branch or the courts, has looked into

these and other disturbing matters concerning his office

and made the results public. If it's true he has a dossier

on all the important figures in officialdom, their un-

willingness to make inquiries is understandable.

But how should people who want to take a hand in

oublic affairs defend themselves against the FBI when

its prurient interests are aroused? Perhaps sex laws

which are öbeyed with the same punctilio as our traffic

laws should be changes to make anything that happens

in private between consenting adults legal. Such is the

case in Illinois. Another response might be to encourage

public nudity and lovemaking, thereby debasing the

value of feelthy pictures and dity tape recordings so

that they can't be used as blackmall.

NW 55234 DocId: 32989657 Page 117

None of this exculpates Mr. Hoover and his repre-

sentatives of what they did. First there is the question

of what they were doing when King was murdered. If

they were in a position to know what kind of under-

wear the man was wearing, where were these girlie-

, magazine cops when the rifleman was drawing a bead

on Dr. King? How come they couldn't see that?

*". What was their role in the investigation of the mur-

der? They appear to be the persons who discovered

•James Earl Ray, the man who is supposed to have done

it alone, although he says he was involved in a con-

spiracy with other unnamed and seemingly unsought in-

dividuals. Lately a witness has been found locked up in

an insane asylum who says the man running from the

flop house bathroom where the shots were fired was not

(James Earl Ray. What knowledge does the FBI have

of that?

Beyond such questions there is the matter of how

the FBI appears to have used Dr. Martin Luther King

Jr. A lot of public men lay claim to the title leader.

They get it with the prefix "Honorable" but nobody's

ever seen the pack of them walking up a street leading

a hundred thousand people. Martin Luther King acluall

was a leader. Millions of people followed him, both lit-

erally and by holding their minds open to his. in-

He made his mistakes, had his weaknesses, commit-

•ted, his stupidities as all leaders and all people do, but

he remains the outstandingly admirable public figure

of our time. He began as a leader of black men and died

a leader of men; he began as a leader in a fight against

the legal formalities upholding racism and died fighting

for decent wages for Memphis garbagemen and for all

of us in attempting to bring peace in Vietnam. He was

such a leader that he taught even his enemies. Today,

what he said 10 years ago can be heard coming out of

the mouth of an Agnew, a Mitchell or a Nixon.

Alt Mr. Hoover misused the power of his office to

bring him down, the FBi director and his accomplices

have performed an act of unpardonable idiocy. Signifi-

cant portions of both races trusted Dr. King to lead them

to a new high ground of fraternal union; he sloc? sir

the legal and peaceful alternative to the killing that's

happening to us now, to the development of our native

Tupamaros. When Chicago police detective James Al-

jano Jr. died the other night of a sniper's bullet, he and

levery urban warfare victim could thank the FBI to the

textent that Mr. Hoover contributed to Dr. King's de-

struction and made those of us who hope for progress

through peace and law look like fools.

This is not the first contact Jackson has had

contact, he noted that JACKSON had made no further statements

against

the Director since prior to the circulation of

ENFORMANT.

CS-CG 6566-R, reliable in the past and familiar

with leading Blacks in the Chicago area, has

been discreetly

contacted regarding JACKSON's charges against the Director

since its inception. He advised substantially as above.

On 8/26/70, source advised rumors circulating in the Black

community are that JESSE JACKSON was reprimanded by leading

Blacks in the Chicago area for his attack on the Director.

Reportedly, AL BOUTE, a Black member of the Chicago Board

of Education; and ED BERRY, former head of the Chicago Urban:

League, were among the individuals who took JACKSON to task

in this matter.

Source noted JACKSON has made no further

commenis about the Director sud thus he feels the ahove has

merit.

• Source had no knowledge of Mrs. ROSCOE BEACH, but

advised he had read about her petition in the newspaper. He

felt the petition must have been very limited in circulation

as the only time he heard about it from any of his contacts

was through the news media after it had

been circulated.

It is the opinion of

the above mentioned

sources

that the issue of the petition is now a "dead

issue" within

the Black community.

contacted regarding above, at which time he advised he has not

of discussion concerning the BEACH

petition and/or additional derogatory statements by JACKSON

concerning the Director.

Source advised to the best of his

knowledge, JACksoN has not made any additional vicious or

derogatory statements regarding the Director since those

statements made prior to the petition's circulation on or

about 8/13/70. This source further advised he has heard no

additional discussion within the Black community regarding Mrs.

ROSCOE BEACH and source considers Mrs. BEACH a "non-entity"

within the "Black Movement".

•It is common knowledge JACKSON can be easily

classified as a "publicity parasite" as he readily attaches

himself to any situation which he feels can be utilized for

self-sustaining purposes, namely, projecting himself into the

public limelight. Based on the

above observations of

knowledgeable sources, it appears JACKSON has, in this

instance, defeated himself. It also appears the BEACH

petition

is a "dead issue"

as she apparently has received

limited support from the Black community and that has been

confined to the immediate area in which she and JACKSON

reside.

It appears JACKSON has possibly put himself at

odds with the

leadership of the scic.

He certainly has

received no backing from National Leaders of scIC in this

matter.

JACKSON has made no further comments concerning the

Director,

to date at least, since prior to 8/15/70, and the

news media has nde no further reference at all to the BEACH

petition.

Chicago feels it is inadvisable to undertake any

activity which will revive this matter as to do so will

only give JACKSON a topic he can utilize to further project

his image - good or bad - he doesn't care which, so long as

it is publicity.

Chicago sets forth the above observations for

Bureau consideration.

In the event the Bureau desires to

pursue this matter further, this office is in a position

to submit suggestions on methods to discredit BEACH, if she

has not sufficiently done so already, and has sources available

to carry through tactics such as letters to the "Chicago Daily

News".

DR. KING'S ACCEPTANCE SPEECH

BROADCAST DATE: December 23, 1964

We congratulate the Reverend Martin Luther King on being awarded the

Nobel Peace Prize for 1964. He deserves the honor because he has led the

people of his race toward full equality of citizenship, and has steadfastl

• refused the temptation to encourage violent demonstration.

But his speech accepting the award was a great disappointment. If Dr

King had been more familiar with Communist propaganda tactics, and with th.

uses that can be made of his speech, he would probably have revised it.

Even Western Europeans who ar: not Communists have only a foggy impre

sion, of race relations in this country. Along with Asians and Africans,

they

are most likely to get an even more false impression from Dr. King's

words

An American audience would easily understand what he meant when he sa:

"twenty-two million Negroes of the United States

are engaged in a creative

battle to end the long night of racial injustice." But he was speaking to

the world, not to an American audience. Those words without qualification

can give a very wrong idea of the American society, and Dr. King did nat

qualify them.

He emphasized all of the dark aspects of the race question

this country, but mentioned the bright spots only casually.

The European of African would suppose that the Negro in the United Sta

is subjected to the worst kinds of oppression, and that he is fighting un-

aided for his own improvement. And that is just the kind of picture

that

the Communist radio broadcasts have been trying to create for vears.

Ambassador PARSONS expressed his appreciation for the Bureau

furnishing this information to him.

He stated he had originally

intended to meet KING on his arrival at the Airport in Stockholm

on 12/12/64. He said this was somewhat unusual in that he

normally does not meet this type of group.

After reflection he

stated he would not personally go to the airport but would send

a representative from the Embassy. According to Ambassador

PARSONS,

KING was to preach at a local church in Stockholm and

then was to meet with a student group.

On 12/5/64 I furnished

the same information, orally,

to U.S. Ambassador WHITE in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Mrs. WHITE

was also appreciative of the information and commented it was

very helpful to know this, even though she would take no

specific action as a result of it.

She was planning to give

small reception for Dr. KING while he was in Copenhagen.

Menorandum from D. J. Brennan, Jr., to Mr. Sullivan,

11/13/64, recommended, and the Director approved, that legat

Bates, London, be authorized to orally brier the United States

Ambassadors in london and Oslo concerning Martin luther King, JI.

The briefing was concerning both the comnunist influences on

King and King's degenerate nature.

Bates had requested such

permission because he anticipated that the Ambassadors might

consider entertaining King while he is in Iurope to receive the

Peace Prize and Bates believed he could forestall such

action by the Ambassadors is they were briefed.

Assistant Legat Minnich, London, telephoned early /

today (11/30/64) and advised that Bates would also like to

Brief our Ambassadors at Stockholm and Copenhagen as King is to

also visit these cities.

The legat's office, london, will

telephone again via cost-iree defense tacilities tomorrow (12/1/64).

Our Ambassador at Stockholm is a career Minister,

J. Graham

Parsons.

The Ambassador at Copenhagen is Mrs. Katherine

Elkus White. We have nothing unfavorable in our files concerning

these two Ambassadors which would preclude giving them the same

briefing we previously gave the Ambassadors at London and Oslo.

Our relations with the Ambassadors are friendly and it is m

belloved that Bates shoule be permitted to brigithem.

RECOMMENDATION:

If approved, we will tell Bates that he may orally

• briel our Ambassadors

in Stockholm and Copenhagen along the

same lines as he previously briefed the Ambassadors at london

and Os10. Upon approval this memorandum should be routed to

Liaison for the necessary advice to Bates via cost-free telephone

facilities.

SA Orrin Bartlett of the Liaison Section advised me today

that he had been requested by Frederick Traband, Security Officer,

state Department, to have the FBl brief the Central Intelligence

Agency (CIA) on the background of Martin Luther King. Traband also

• FBI should request CIA to give close coverage to King's

activities while King is in Europe to accept his Nobel Peace Prize.

Traband further said that at the moment there are partial plans for

King to make a rather extensive trip through Africa on behalf of the

United States Government in early 1965. SA Bartlett asked me what

he should advise Traband.

I feel that we should not comply with Traband's request.

We have already furnished some information to CIA concerning King's

activities.

We plan to disseminate to CIA in the immediate future

a 'document which will give King's complete background.

We have no reason to request CIA to surveil King while

he is in Europe.

If State Department wants CIA to place him under

surveillance, it is up to State Department to make the request of

CIA.

12/1164 Pratend, State adoraide

ACTION:

If you approve, we will advise Traband that it is already

our policy in our liaison with CIA to furnish that Agency with infor-

mation of interest to them.

Traband should also be advised that the

FBI does not contemplate requesting CIA to cover King's activities

while he is abroad.

If State Department wants King covered, State

should make the request directly of CIA.

My memoranda (2) to you 11/10/64 advised of plans being

made by king and his advisors for activities in connection with

King's receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, Norway, 12/10/64.

Very prominent in these arrangements is Bayard Rustin, the former

Young Communist League member who is also a convicted homosexual!!

King plans on being in London, England,

12/6-7/64 enroute to

Oslo and desires a meeting with England's new Prime Minister

Harold Wilson.

other reasons, Rustin planned to go to london 11/11/64 (Veteran's,

Day).

Tal

Through our highly confidential coverage of prineipals

in this matter, we learned that. there was a delay of one or two

days" in Rustins obtaining a renewal of his passport thus delaying

his departure for London from 11/11 to 11/12/64. Rustin claimed

to an associate that he had gotten the White House and the National

Democratic Committee to help expedite the renewal of his passport.

He also claimed that lee White also assisted.

(Although White

was not identified, the reference undoubtedly is to the

White House aide by the same name who frequently serves as

I1ais0n between the White House and Rustin and King.)

tially furnished the following information by Robert Johnson,

from Norway.

Rustin stated that king is considering naking

a speech at Carnegie Hall and selling tickets for the

affair, the minimum price to be $100.

Hachtel said that

King has inquired about the possibility that President Lyndon B.

Johnson might attend such an affair, but that the president

would not give in answer until after the elèction. According

to Hachtel, Lee White, a White House alde, has stated

relative to the President's attendance "the answer is not

no." White has indicated that if the President could

not attend, the President would send the Vice President

1n his place. Rustin indicated that a cocktall party would

be held before the Carnegle Hall address by king.

Fustin and lachtel then discussed who might

assist in the arrangements.

Wachtel stated that Saul Mills

had handled the arrangements for a concert for "us" and

had made $45,000 for "us." According to Wachtel, Mills 15

Interested in the King affair and has submitted a memorandum

of ideas on the subject.

Rustin and Wachtel agreed to neet

with Mills to discuss the matter.

Wachtel stated that he

would send Rustin a copy of the memorandum by Hills and in

reference thereto Wachtel said that he thought the plans

in the memorandum were too ambitlous for they included an

address by King before Congress and & ticker tape parade.

Machtel told Rustin that he is handling the

details concerning King's trip to Norway and has spoken

to the Norwegian Ambassador:

Rustin then informed Hachtel that King desires to

have DI. Bunche and some white person to act as cochairmen

of the affair welcoming king back to the United States, but

that Bunche

person will be. Rustin indicated that he had considered

having Senators Robert Kennedy and Jacob Javits as cochairmen

so that there would be a nonpartisan element present.

RUStIn

stated that after due consideration he thought it would

probably be best to just have Bunche as chairman and have

a subcommittee assisting him.

Hachtel agreed with this idea.

Rustin also informed Hachtel that king had been invited by

" the President of Brazil to visit that country, but that king

Ilke to visit that country, he vill be unable to do so on

his return trip from Norway and would be unable to visit

Brazil, until alter the beginning of the new year.

On Novenber ", 1962, Hachtel contacted Rustin

concerning the plans for velcoming ling back to the

united states and rachter stated that he dad sposen to

the White House and "the Kennedy front" regarding this

mattex.

Wachtel said that he has louis Hartin of the

Denocratic National Committee "Iined up." It is Hachtel's

belief that President Johnson will come to New York City.

Wachtel stated that he is waiting to hear from Senator Robert

Kennedy In this matter as well.

Wachtel Instructed Rustin to speak with Di. Bunche

and tell him that 11 the UN gave a luncheon for King, it

would be better 1f held after King's return to the

United States, but that the final decision is being left to

the UN people. Wachtel suggested that 1f, the UN affair

was held before King's departure for Norway, December 4,

1964, would be a good date because it is just after the

opening of the General Astembly at the UN and there will

be many prominent people there. Wachtel noted the possibillty

Imagine Brezhney embracing

Martin like Khrushchev did Castro?" Rustin replied in the

altimative.

Vachtel stated that no plans u111 be made for &

ticker tape parade for King until an answer is received

from President Johnson. According to Wachtel, Louis Martin

of the Democratic National Committee should be given

something to do "even 11 it is just selling tickets."

Rustin mentioned the possible use of an armory and stated

"It would be necessary to contact Governor Nelson Rockefeller

of New York who is vacationing in Spain. Hacktel indicated

that this could be done later by telephone since there w111

be additional ideas for the Governor's participation.

Summarizing, Wachtel mentioned that Mayor Robert Wagner of

• New York City could have the ticker tape parado; U Thant,

Secretary General, UN, could have the dinner for king; and

Governor rociseteller could have the reception for King.

explained that the reason for raising funds is that "we"

$2,000,000 "in the hole on the kississippi

business" and that there are about 17 churches which have

to be rebuilt. rustin suggested that arrangements might

be made to have the London Embassy of some African nation

On November 9, 1964, Rustin told an assoclate

he had won the award. Mrs.

tered yesterday "thoroughly ex-

The new Nobel Prize winner is

head of the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference. A stu-

dent of Mohandas K. Gandhi's

passive resistance movement in

India, he concluded that the tac-

tic of "non-violence" could be

his most effective weapon

against racial segregation in the

United States.

He was chosen from a secret

list of 20 lo 30 names. The prize

will be arrarded personally by

Norwegian King Olal V at Oslo

Universily Nov. 10.

American

winners

included

President Woodrow Wilson, sec-

Bunche became thé first Negro

,tó be awarded the prize in 1950.

The secoud Negro winner was

Chief Albert Luthuli, South Afri-

can civil rights leader.

The peace prize for 1963 went

to the International Red Cross.

The Nobel Committeé, as

usual, gave no reason for its

choice.

But it was no, secret King, a

Baptist minister and co-pastor

with his father of the Ebeneezer

Baptist Church in Atlanta, was

cited for his leadership of the

American Negro cause.

King, has been in jail more

than a dozen times in the cause

of racial integration. He is the

author of books dealing with his

theory of passive resistance to

segregation.

He first rose to national promi-

nence when he led the successful

Montgomer, Ala., bus boycott,

in 1956. It was a battle

that

took a year of walking for Bir-

mingham Negroes.

At King's

urging the Negroes declined to

ride segregated buses. King and

other Negro Jeaders kept the

drive going with weekly mass

meetings in their churches for

- the entire year of the boycott.

The peace price winner is no

stranger to violence.

At least

three allempts have been macie

on his life.

In New

York in

September, 1958, a woman armed

with a letter opener and a loaded

pistol stabbed him while he was

autographing copies of one of his

books in a Harlem department

stufu.

Nobelman King

The world's newest winner of the Nobel Peace

Prize is Dr. Martin Luther King, and in their hearts

even those who differ with this Negro leader must

know that the choice was right. Dr. King's gifts.

as an orator and as an organizer of the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference have made him

a national figure. But what has made Dr. King

a world figure has been his determination to use

his gifts to combat the spirit of violence as well

as the blight of bigotry.

Dr. King is a conscious disciple of Ghandi, the

prophet of passive resistance.

The technique of

passive resistance has been peculiarly effective

for the American Negro, who must ultimately

rely on the awakened conscience of a white major-

ity to free both races from the bondage of hate. Be-

ginning with the Montgomery bus boycott, Dr.

King has proved immensely effective in channel-

ing Negro militance into forms of demonstration

that have been at once dramatic and nonviolent.

Curiously enough, Ghandi himself evolved the

doctrine of passive resistance when he was a

young lawyer practicing in South Africa. Ghandi

was influenced by the Russian Tolstoi and by the

Yankee individualist Thoreau. All of these

sources have fused in the person of Martin Luther

King, who has proved again the power of an idea

whose time has come.

Americans can rejoice

in the selection made by a committee of the Nor-

wegian Parliament. for a prize that honors Dr.

King's race and his country.

Is Nobel Prize Really for Peace?

Rev. Martin Luther King Jr, is the second Ameft-

can Negro to win the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1950 Ralph

johnson Bunche was awarded it for his service to world

peace as the U.N mediator on Palestine in 1948-49.

Prior to his mission to the Middle East, Bunche had

earned international recognition as a diplomat and stu-

dent of world affairs. Occasionally he has taken on ac-

tive part in promoting civil rights in the United States.

But Negroes have benefited little or nothing from

his making an issue of membership in a private club.

•Instead, he has contributed to world respect for Ne-

groes by being a man of great talent and achievement.

Although King is known internationally as a civil

rights leader, his work has been entirely in this country

and mainly in the South. He has preached non-violence, i

Vet demonstrations which he helped organize and many

more that were inspired by his teachings all too often

have ended in violence.

What he has done for domestic peace much less

world brotherhood completely escapes us. If the Nobel

prize is for civil rights activity then he deserves it,

although the honor for that might be disputed in behalf

Irán Dilemma" has been a great influence on U.s.

Attorney General Nicholas deB.. Katzenbach.

It was indicated

that arrangements had also been made for

to meet with president Lyndon B. Johnson alter the

meeting with Mr. Katzenbach; however,

the neeting with

the President is to receive no publicity. King and his

Another confidential source has advised that

Harry Wachtel, a close adviser to King who was a member of

the National Lawyers Guild, which organization was

described as Communist front by the Conmittee on

Un-American Activities of the U. S. House of Representatives,

on February 7, 1965, was in contact with Clarencel Jones,

another close adviser to kins who in the mid-1950's was

a member of the Labor Youth League, which organization has

been designated as Subversive pursuant to E. O. 10450.

Wachtel said that he had been in touch with

LeelWhite of the thite House about King's coming trip to

Washington, Da C.

Hachtel said the trip has opened up a

hornet's nest for the President and King's statement about

a meeting with the President will have to ba very carefully

worded.

wachtel said the White House would like certain

words, such as

, "not definite," "hopeful" and "in view of

circunstances" used by King in his statement about meeting

the President.

Wachtel said King vould actually see the President

sometime alter king's meeting on Tuesday, February 9, 1965,

with the Vice President and the Attorney General but

that

fact must be kept in complete secrecy.

Wachtel said thai

If the lact should become known, then

the President will not

see King. Wachtel indicated that he was not happy over the

alternatives this leaves then,

Machtel mentioned that he hates to see the Vietnam

crises and

said he was told that the National Security

Council expects to meet on jonday and Tuesday.

Wachtel

said that now King knows, when he is dealing with the

President, he is not dealing with a friend, but a Texan.

Jones read to Wachtel the prepared text for a

press release concerning King's visit to Washington, D. C.,

which is set forth as sollovs with corrections suggested by

Wachtel.

"Recent events in Selma, Alabama, have disclosed

the persisting barriers to enfranchisement of Negroes in

the South. If the rate of registration manipulated in Selma

were to prevail, it would take several decades to register

eligible Negroes. The mandate of the American people and

the intention of Congress are subverted by these conditions.

There is a clear and urgent need for new and improved

Federal legislation and expanded lav enforcement to eliminate

these undemocratic barriers.

To pursue this objective,

conferences in Washington have been scheduled.

The pressure

of international developments have made impractical the

scheduled Honday conferences.

However, on Tuesday I will be

meeting with Vice President Humphrey in his new capacity as

chairman of the newly created Council for Equal Opportunity

and with Attorney General Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, I am in

communication with the White House concerning a possible

meeting with the President.

While there are no definite

arrangements for such a meeting, I am hopeful that such a

conference will be held on Tuesday.

Following the preliminary

explorations of the issue, plans will be made for further

discussion on appropriate levels where the programs we

believe to

be indispensable for solution of problems can be

examined."

a big lund raising project.: It will include a showing of the movie "The

Greatest Story Ever Told" and It wouls scare the house. of

E about $28, 000. "

In addition, there are two or three wealthy people trying to get 50 couples

to give $1, 000 (presumably each couple) and they have 26 commitments

already.

King claimed that his organization, the Southern Christian

Leadership Conterence. (solC), needs the money desperately.

They" aiso

aiscussed a group in New Rochelle, New York, which King said already had

$5,000 and desired to use it for a fundraising project to earn even more.

Jones told King that the advertisement which appeared in "The New York

Times" 2/5/65 soliciting funds on behalf of the SeLc cost $2,000.

King

that his office had already received $12,000 as à result of this advertise

SNCC claims

Harry Belafonte (noted Negro singer). According to Jones, Belafonte is

the only person that SNCC Will listen to ad that he has heard

Belafonte stop SNCC workers who tried to attack king's integrity. King

said that he did not like for SNCC to fight against the idea ofhaving

leader for the whole movement.

King stated that the movement must have a

leader because any ideology is fostered around having a leader around whon

supporters can rally.

Jones believes that he can arrange an unpublicized

meeting between SNCC, SCIC and Belafonte.

MR. BISHOP

Nr. Newbold Noyes, Editor of The Evenis, ltar called. He said

he thanked me vosy much for talising to hire because he knew this was an

unusual kind of thing to have happen.

He said he wanted to ack me very seriously, but he was sure I was

familiar with this and given thought to it already, but he wanted to repori on

the basis of their atory that was run yesterday about the authorization that

the FBI had from Nir. Robert Kennedy, to release the King material; that

they are getting a great deal of static irow people who are telling them -

they say they have this authorization, but they don't release it and don't show

Thi to muumstris ag am many di these documents that have been releases

in the past are luzzy and don't really shew there was clear authorization to

do this and in general there is a nondispostion on the part of the readers to

accept the idea that Bob Kennedy actually did authorize the tapping of King's

phone. lie said, "Now I just want to abi you as sericusly as I can to release

those documents. You have them. They do show, & presume, exactly what

you say.".

I told Mir. Noyes that he authorized it in his own handwriting on

October 10, 1963; it was Installed November 8, 1063, and discontinued

April 30, 19S5. I told Mr. Noyes that, as a matter of fact, when kennedy

was Attorney General he requested that the telephones of Dr. Ling be covered

by electronic device and was persuaded by our people not to do it in view of .

the possible repercussions, then later he changed his mind and delayed

bringing the matter up again until in October the authority was signed by him

in his own handwriting and it gave us the authority to do it and we discontinued

it on April 30, 1985, under the administration of Attorney General Katzenbach.

Mi. Noyes said he understood and asked it they could report this. I toid him

line on this is that Mi. Tolsou wrote (Carl) Rowan about his slanderous column

nint guest and he rown, te back tehich ate a series of elent on

Wilkins: of the NAACP, Farmer, eight or nine others, Abernathes; or if we

had tapped the phones of a Congressman; and various other things. Mr. Noyes

said he was not asking all that. I toid him he could certainly print what i say

because we are writing back to Rowan today that since he did not seek any facts

before printing his column, he was not entitled to any information from us at

this tinie, but as to the question he has astred, the dates that these wiretaps

were on, I have the original copy of it on my desks. It was signed by Kennedy

in his own handwriting on October 10, 1963.

Mr. Noyes said it I had one minute, could he repeat back to me what

he understood I had said to him so there would be no misunderstanding and also

souls ho toke ire that it was adding into it some details that he thought they

already understood about this from other sources they have talked to.

He said It was his understanding that in June, 1963, Me. Kennedy

did suggest through a liaison man that he had with me, that I should keep an

eye on Martha huther Eing because of his association with people that he,

Robert Kennedy, was concerned about and he, Noyes, was particularly talking

about Stanley Levinson and a fellow named Jones, both of whom were supposed

to be of Marzist leanings and that the Attorney General was concerned about

King's relations with these people and he thought it might be a good idea to put

an electronic aurveillance device of some type into the picture to see what he

was doing; that the FBI suggested at that time that this would be a difficult

thing to do because of the fact that king traveled around so much and there were

a lot of political repercussions that might result; but then subsequently on the

7th of November (and I corrected him and told him October 7, 1903) -- on

October 7, 1963, I reported, and this is a memorandum from me to the attorney

General, a four-paragraph document, that I had determined the feasibility of

establishing taps on the telephones of the SCLC headquarters at Atlanta and

New York and if he authorized it, I was prepared to go ahead and do it and that

came back to me, the memorandum, with his initials. I told him with his full

name, Robert E. Kennedy. Mr. Noyes continued - o. I, "& by him, dating that

10/10/63. I told Mr. Noyeathat was correct.

Nir. Noyes continued that it was his understanding that had no

objection to his using this . is it o.k. for them to identily the FBI as

the source or flatly say it on their own. & told him I would rather he fatly

said it on his own, but i anticipate similar requests from other sources that

I would not be as franks with as I have been with hin. Mr.'Noyes said 0.t.;

that he thought this is & wise thing for me to do.

He said if I had one more minute, he would like to tell me one

Feason why he happened to be interested tr this thing. Hesaid he had some

young people with whom he was friendly who were involved in a wedding

this weekend and the boys and girls all ended up at his house after the thing

and he did not inow whether they had read Rowan's column, but theya were

talking about the fact how dreadiul it was that the T'BI would have presumed to

tap the phone or keep an eye on Martin Luther King, a great hero.

Es said

sitor llotosing to tie for about an loui aiù a icis, it ivid iler io noia on

& minute, that it was his understanding that the Bureau had been checising on

king because there had been allegations that he had been in touch with

recognized or potential communist agents and the reason nothing was ever

released or done about it was that aiter checking into it, they became

satisited there was nothing dangerous and he asiced them what they would

think of a Government that did not check into information that seemed to show

that communist agents were trying to work on a man in Martin Luther King's

position. He said these iids listened and were astounded that there might be

another side to it, and he was telling me that this was taken by Bobby Kennedy

from the point of view of the generation gap. Mr. Noyes said he thought this

is an important story. I said he became a kind of Messiah for the generation

gap and individuals who vere pro-king and still arc.

I told Mr. Noyes that as to the matter of electronic installations,

I have never authorized an electronic installation of any kind at any time

except with written approval of the then Attorney General and that goes right

down to today. I said I do not have authority to do it myself and I do not want

it as I feel the Attorney General should be the one to approve or not approve

electronic survelllances and we use it only in interral security cases and now

in organized crime. I said in organized crime, the authority has to be obtained

from the courts under the McClellan bill and in security cases - espionage,

communist activities - that"is approved by the Attorney General, which ts

allowed under the McClellan Bill. I contlaued that the Rowan article indicated

we were promiscuously continuing this sort of thing without regard to restriction:

or regard to authorily, so the truth of the matter is, I have never ever authorizes

the installation of a technical electronic device except with the approval of the

Attorney General in writing and we have of tie the original documents that

support that statement.

Vir. Noyes said that when he first asked me, I said it was all right

"to cite the Bureau for the authority and then I indicated I would rather have is

come from them directly. He said il in order to give this the authority it

should have, it is necessary for him to cite me for the authority for some of

this, is that o.k. with me. I told him that normally I would say no; that I

would defer to his judgement because he knows more about the matter of

public relations and public reactions I told him Thave been astounded at the

reaction on this thing. I said some ne these magazines, like Mowoweek,

which is owned by the Washington Post, carried the Cassius Clay testimony

in Texas where he is on trial and where the use of the electronic devica was

exposed, and they stated the Agent testified the taps were continued until

King's death. I said that is untrue and the Agent did not so testily. I said

in the King case, it was discontinued April 30, 1965. I told lir. Noyes that

il he thought it would be to the best interest of public relations in clearing

up any really Berious doubts newspaper people have, i would have no objection

to being quoted.

MI. Noyes said he thanked me and he thought I was making a wise

decision in letting it come out. He said he thought it may be one of the rost

important stories of the year.

I told Mr. Nogsthat when I read the Sunday paper and Rowan's

article I thought here is an individual who is a Messiah of the dissident left,

of which Rowan is a part, and yet it mas done at the instance oi Bobby Kennedy,

who later became a great friend of King's, notwithstanding he linew all the

facts, as I kept him advised as well as every Attorney General Bince.

Mr. Noyes said there is one thing about this I should consider and

that is that he has the gist of what is in these things from me, but I will be

asked immediately to release them tastually. He said he thought I ought to do it.

I told him I would have to get the authority of the Attorney General for that.

Mr. Noyes said that is another probles, but the text ought to come out. He

said it is very well for me to say what is in them, but the text ought to come

out. I told him I realized that. He said he ghought once before we had put out

photostats.

I told him a Congressman, Gross, made inquiry in regard to some

of Kennedy's authorizationsbefore he died and after he left the Attorney

Generalship, I said he denied he had approved certain authorizations and I

sent to the Congressman Xerox copies of the authorization zined by kennedy,

as he being a Congressman, & felt he was entitled to it, and/ then Adorney

General approved.

I said in this instance, if we get a request from a Congressmar

or Senator along the lines he indicated, I would submit it to the Attorney General

with my recommendation. Mr. Noyes said I was going to get an immediate

request within the next coude of hours or as soon as he can get this out ...

Nr. Noyes thanked me.

I returned a call from Mr. Newbold Noyes and he told me he very

much appreciated my calling him back. He said be realized aiter we were

finished talicing that there was this one rather crucial question that he had not

asked me and he did not know whether I could comment on it os not, but it

seemed necessary to ask it; namely, whether the investigation of De. King

did or did not reveal any suspicion of Marsist character. I told him i could not

answer that question to be quoted. I told him i could say to him off the record

and for his own information it did but I could not be quoted on that. Mi. Noyes

said he understood and that & understood the thing that most concerned hiza was

the possibility that it cleared him in which case it seemed to him essential

that they put it in the story, but they will handle it exactly as it is. I said it

did not clear him at all, but I cannot mention that because it would reveal the

confidentlal character of the investigation we made. Mr. Noyes again thanked

me.

SUBJECT:

COMMUNIST PARTY, USA

NEGRO QUESTION

COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN RACIAL MATTERS

INTERNAL SECURITY - C

I thought you would be interested in a resume of pertinent

data concerning captioned matter, with particular reference to the

communist influence on the 8/28/63 March on Washington.

First, as to

communist "participation," you will recall that at the 10/1-6/63 meet-

ing of

the National Executive Committee of the Party, Gus Hall stated

that an estimated 5,000 communists participated in the March in one

way or another.

As to the number of Party members (here we are differ-

entiating between communists and Party members), the following analysis

=-h=- h2- tade from reports received from the field. For the purpose of

making this estimate,

we considered as current Communist Party (CP)

members any individuals who have been reported to be members of the

Party since 1/1/62. The estimate, based upon our field reports, 1s

as follows.

A total of 125 CP members from the territories covered by

all field offices other than New

York was reported as observed in

Washington, D. C., 8/28/63. The New York Office reported a total of

37. The total for all offices, therefore, is 162.

He also had reported to us that an additional 67 Party mem-

bers were observed boarding transportation media in the New York City

area destined for Washington on 8/28/63. While it cannot be positively

stated that these 67 were actually observed in Washington, D. C., it

would be a fairly logical assumption that they did come to Washington,

barring such unusual circumstances as a breakdown of a bus or buses or

any of the chartered trains.

We had no reports of such happenings.

Therefore, if we were to add these 67 to the other 162, we could, with

justified logic, estimate that approximately 229 Party members were in

Hashington, D. Co+ On 8/28/65- REC-39 1 00-1-116-525

It is significant to note that among the current Party men-

bers who were in Washington were such national functionaries as Gus

Hall, General Secretary; Joseph Brandt, Administrative Assistant; Phil

Bart,

National Organizational Secretary; James E. Jackson, Editor-in-

Chief of "The Worker"; Arnold Johnson,

We

also had considerable information from the field concerning indi-

viduals who came to Washington, D. C., for the March whose current

membership (according to the standards set out above) was not estab-

lished but who were identified either as former Party members or as

a dentite cita

individuals having other subversive connections. For example, the

New York Office reported, in addition to the current Party members

set out above, that 18 former Party members were in Washington on

8/28/63 and 14 other individuals having subversive connections were

in Washington that date.

This memorandum sets out the facts pertaining to the

Baltimore Officers handling of captioned matter in connection

with the 8/28/63 Marci on Washington. It summarizes explanations

of Baltimore persoine for an apparent delay in their handling

of this matter and reconmends no further administraiive action.

ir

By several Bureau communications, both prior and

-subsequent to 0/20/03;

Baltimore was alerted to the importance

shing in the Bureau information as io the

conmunist influence in the March on Kashington.

submitted

Baltimore

a letterhead memorandum (till) by cover of airiel 9/19/63;

reporting infornation from a single informan't, obtained 9/18/63;

that In named Parcy nembers attended the March, and that one passed

*out 1,000 leaflets adversising a Party bookstore.

Bureau review of

WIN repealed that 4 of the 1l were informants, including the

person who passed out the leailets, and that Baltimore had not

submitted any reports from these 4 informants.

rusther, the

information as to the leaflet distribution was the first known

0 the Bureau.

Baltimore was requested io submit explanations

for the delay which apparently existed in Baltimore's debriefing

of its informants and submission of incormation to the Bureau.

It was also requested to furnish further details concerning the

leaflet distribution which the Lill indicated took place in

Washington, D. C.

Super Laurice E. Garcison, BaltiMore, furnished

{ull explanation as t0 Baltimore's handling of this matter which

he personally coordinaied.

Explanation reveals thai Baltimore

was on top of the sizuation in debriefing its infomanis promptly

but delayed somewhat its report to the Bureau because the Party

in Baltimore did not exert or attempt to exert any influence

on the larch.

Those Party members that did attend the merch

did so as indiviáuals.

Further; the reported distribuiion of

leaflets did not take place in Washington, D. C., but rather in

Baltimore,

in and around one assembly point for Baltimore

participants in the liarch.-

Nemorandum to Mr. Sullivan

RE :

CONIUNIST PLEDY, USA:

NEGRO QUESTION

COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN RACIAL MATTERS.

SAC, Baltinore, notes the ambiguous language used

in Baltimore's Lit giving

the impression that

leaflet distribu.

whereas it actually

tion tool placo in Nashing outined the handling of this matter

happoned in Baltimore.

by his office which indicates that they were apparently on top of

the situation.

He also noied that the delay in submitting

information

1 to the Bureau was predicated on the belier that the

information was not particularly pertinent because the Party

membership participating in the larch acted only as individuals.

SAC states,

"In looking back now, it is understandable that the

Bureau would nave preferred that it be rurnisned immediately, In

spite of the fact that it aid not add any significant intormation

reflecting Communist influence in the organization of the March

on Mashingion." SAC believes thai no further administrative action

is warranted.

OBSERVATIONS:

The explanations submitted by Baltimore plus the

comments of the SAC reveal

that Baltimore did debrief its

" sources promptly; and, that while it was somewhat slow in

furnishing the information to the Bureau, the

substantive aspects

of this case have not been adversely affected. rurther, the

challenging by the Bureau of the information concerning the leaflet

distribution served to arrest erroneous information from being

disseminated.

Baltimore has submitted a revised and more complete

IHN dated 9/27/53 which has already been disseminateü. It is

believed that the correspondence had wiüh Baltimore in this matters

particularly the necessity for Supervisor Garrison to submit

an

explanation, will have the desired effect of impressing the

Baltimore Office with the importance of this matter and the need

for diligent handling in the future.

RECORDINDATION:

Concur with SAC that no further action is warranted.

He felt that some efforts should be made by the Party to force

New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller to take an active part in

breaking any filibuster

which may develoy in Congress.

Davis

referred to a recent article of columnist David Lawrence in the

"New York Herald Tribune" wherein Lawrence decreed the March on

Washington as a day of disgrace.

Therefore, Davis called for

a picket line to be placed around the "New York Herald Tribune"

building.

It was stated that the March on Washington would be

further discussed by these Party leaders on September 3, 1963.

However, this matter was not discussed as planned, according to

our sources.

NEGRO QUESTION

COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN RACIAL MATTERS

IS - C

In a memorandum Evans to Belmont dated August 26, 1963,

captioned "March on Washington, August 28, 1963, Racial Matters,"

it was pointed out that one of

the greatest concerns ot the

Department is what action the Nation of Islam (NOI) may take

in connection with the March.

All of our offices have been alerted for some time concerning

the possibility that the NOI may take some action in connection

with the March. All information developed to date indicates

that the Nol does not in any way plan to participate in the

March on Washington.

Nevertheless, in view of the concern

expressed by Department officials, I called SAC Gillies of

Our

Washington Field Office on 8/25/63 and instructed him to be

especially alert concerning actions of NOI members in Hashington

with respect to the March.

Again on the morning of 8/27/63, I

talked with SAC Gillies concerning this matter.

He stated that

he had specifically assigned a number of Special Agents to cover

the activities of the NOI.

said his office is keeping a very

close watch on this situation; that informants have been alerted

and: that he will keep the Bureau immediately advised of any

activities of the NOl in connection with the March.

ACTION:

We are following this matter closely and will keep you

advised of developments.

NBC TELEVISION PROGRAM, 8-25-63

Pacele

T.

Captioned program was monitored by SA Ervin L. Recer of the Crime &

Records Division on 8-25-63. Guests on the program were Roy Wilkins, Executive

Secretary of the National Association of the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)

and Reverend Martin Luther King, head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

They were questioned by panelists Lawrence Spivak, Frank Vanderlin, Nashville news-

man,and Robert McNeil, NBC News.

The show produced nothing new and the FBI was not mentioned.

Wilkins was questioned generally concerning the August 28th march in

Washington. He said he did not anticipate any violence during the demonstration, that

if it did occur the Negro cause might be hurt but that the slight risk involved is out-

weighed by the benefits which will accrue. He said it was hoped the demonstration will

| lead to quick action by the Congress in passing the pending civil rights bill. Wilkins

stated he does not believe "large scale violence" will occur if Congress does not pass

I this bill but he indicated colored demonstrations will continue unabated.

King was questioned at some length concerning Bayard Rustin, Deputy

Director and Chief Planner of the march who was King's secretary in the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference from 1955 to 1960. It was pointed out to King that

Rustin has admitted former membership in the Young Communist League and that he

is known to have attended the Communist Party National Convention as an "impartial

observer" in 1957.

HICTI

King stated that Rustin

renounced his Communist Party connections

years ago and today "has no convictions" in this respect. He attempted to play down

Rustin's role in the forthcoming march, stating that he has contributed some good

planning to the demonstration but is not a chairman or one of the main leaders of it.

King also stated that he does not think the Negro is moving too fast in the civil rights

tiẹla, that this is !

"social revolution" which has been largely peaceful and that it will

contique to be that way.

RE: "Meet the Press, " NBC Television Program, 8-25-63

With regard to Bayard Rustin, the files indicate that he is one of the

foremost Negro exponents of pacifism in the United States and has been referred to

as an "expert on civil disobedience." He is an orator of some prominence and has

delivered lectures at many universities ad pacifist meetings throughout the country.

He has been very active in picket lines and demonstrations and has agitated against

military conscription and racial segregation. He has been arrested on numerous

occasions in connection with these demonstrations. The files reflect that approximately

20 years ago he was a member of the Young Communist League, that he has attended

Communist Party Conventions and in 1957 was an observer at the Communist Party.

Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach stated that he felt there would

be only two groups, that would have the organized potential and ability to cause

serious trouble. He identified these as the Nation of Islam group and the

communists. He asked that we intensify our coverage of these two groups on

Monday and Tuesday, maintaining exceptionally close contact with our informants

and sources so that any current in ormation as to plans would be availabl

to the Departmeni

It was suggested that the Department should arrange to have a

representative in contact with Julius We Hobson, Head of CoRE in

washington, at all times on August Loth.

• Katzenbach said that there was

a Secret Service agent who is a Negro and who is very capable, and he

proposes to have this Secret Service agent assigned to Hobson. The agent

will have a pocket radio and will be in constant communication with the

Metropolitan Police Department.

In this connection, Katzenbach felt we should know, although this

has been maintained in confidence by the White House, that Secret Service

agents will be mingling with the crowd on August 28th for the purpose of

observing and keeping Secret Service Headquarters at the White House

advised of developments.

Katzenbach also advised that John Nolan, the Attorney General's

Administrative Assistant, will act as coordinator for him on August 28th,

and current information from the FBI on that date should be furnished to

Nolan telephonically.

ACTION TO BE TAKEN:

Current information as to the activities of the Muslims and the

communists, together with any data on the individuals specitically namea,

will be expeditiously furnished to the Department in line with their requests.

If contact has not already been made with the Secret Service,

Liaison should do this so we can be assured that there will be no conflict

between that organization and the activities which the Bureau willbe

performing on August 28th.

Close contact will be maintained with our informants and

sources so we will be currently aware of the plans and activities of the

Nation of Islam and the Communist Party®

James Jackson, T. R/Bassett, Louis Weinstock, George Morris, Alvin Simon,

Andrea/London Mike Davidow, Jäck Stachel, and Jesus/Colon on 8/22/63. I told

him that obviously, contrary to what The Worker" claimed, some of these

individuals were not newspaper men.

Guthman asked my opinion as to whether these individuals should be

granted press passes or not. I told him that was a decision for the Department to

make; however, he should realize that the granting of press passes to these individuals

would give them authority to pass through police lines and to participate in any

situation which might occur on 8/28/63. Guthman replied that he knew this to be

true; however, he felt that the theory of "Freedom of the Press, " regardless of what!

press, would overrule my thought in the matter. I told him that we all respected

"Freedom of the Press" but that we should also consider the fact that "Freedom of

r

the Press" did not embrace the right to agitate, incite to riot, or take advantage of

other freedoms such as demonstration. Guthman stated he had not thought of the

problem in that matter.

Guthman called back one hour later 8/22/63 and stated he had talked

with Ben Gilet of the Washington at he and les tee serenine these edents e

for the police department. He stated that he and Gilbert had agreed that the letter from

"The Worker" would not be acknowledged.

It James Jackson and his group of so-

called "reporters" show up at the Metropolitan Police Department and demand press

credentials for 8/28/63, Jackson will be given credentials but the remainder of the

group will be turned down. I told Guthman that he, of course, should understand that

' this was the Department's decision. He acknowledged that it was.

SYNOPSIS

SECRET.

The march on washington scheduled for august 28,

1963, which has created nationwide interest, is being actively

supported by various legitimate sonsubversive religious,

fraternal, civil and labor organizations.

Current information developed as a result of our

investigation of the Communist Party (CP), USA, activities

does not indicate that this event was actually. initiated by

or is controlled by the CP. However, it is pertinent to

note that when Martin Luther King,

ix., one of the leaders

NV

or the march, Ilist conceived the

idea of organizing the

March on Washington, he discussed the matter with stanley David

Levison, a concealed co member,

"and sought Levison's adviceas

to whether the time was right for such a move.

Levison agreed

"The time is now." The lact that King consulted Levison

assumes

additional significance in the light of information

we received from a

source who has furnished reliable infor

mation in the past to the effect that in May, 1992, a national

functionary of the CPUSA commented that Stanley, Levison, by

paIns of his association with the Martin Luther King movement,

was going the most imhortant tori in tha barry at that time.

With respect to Levison's Party connection, we received

Information in June, 1963, that although he still has strong

communist convictions and

still acts as an effective Party

advisor to King, he has become critical of the Party's role

in the civil rights movement. Levison said he does not

consides himself to be under the control of the Party with

respect to his dealings with King. (5)

The Party, is actively supporting the March, in

spite of its awareness of a public statement by leaders

of the March that they did not want "any conmunists."

support or the March is manifested by endorsement of the

March in the communist press to foster the illusion that

the CP is a humanitarian group acting in the interest of

the Negro, and by Party leadership urging rank-and-file

CP members to clandestinely participate in the March.

This clandestine participation is a Party tactic which

is apparently being used in order not to alienate the

organizations sponsoring the March since the Party views

this event as a golden opportunity to reach a growing

poweriul mass movement for Negro civil rights.

The Party plans to distribute openly its literature,

in various locations outside of Washington, D. C.

In addi

tion, the Party hopes to sell 10, 000 of its pamphlets.

No

distribution of Party literature is planned in Washington,

D. Co, in deference to public announcements by leaders of

the March that there is to be no literature of any type

distributed in

Washington during the March:

Coy rage of communist activity in connection with

the March is lanned at present through six Bureau security

informants wo are coming to the Marck with local groups.u)

A erican communists in Mexico are supporting the

March, incl sing the collection of funds for the purpose of

sending tel grams to March on Washington headquarters. (4)

Endorsement of the March has been announced by the

Socialist Workers Party (SWP) (cited as subversive under

Events which sub

sequently flow from the March

will be of utmost importance,

such as following up on contacts now being made by CP members

working in support of the demonstration. Utilizing the

March, the Party has three basic general objectives:

(1) Participation by CP members through legitimate

organizations.

(2) Attempt to get the Party line into the hands oi

sympathizers and supporters of the March through

distribution of "The Worker" and Party pamphlets.

(3) Utilize the March as a steppingstone for future

It is pertinent to note here, however, the conversa

with

Stanley David Levison,

1 Juze I, 1963.

It is known to us that levison and King have

As

known as Roy Bennett, were organizers for the CP. in New York.

have been heavy financial and his brother, Roy Bennett, boch

members of the Parcy

During the

alore-mentioned conversation, King commented he had never seen

the Negro community as aroused, as determined, and as enthusi

He said that "We are on the threshold

of a significant breakthrough and the greatest weapon is mass.

demonstration,"

King added "We are at the point where we can

mobilize all of this righteous indignation into a poweriul mass

movement." King suggested that there be a mass march of literally

thousands and thousands of people on Washington. King said that

even the threat of such a march might so frighten the President

that he would have to do something. He asked Levison "Are ve

ready for that." In reply, Levison said two things would have

to be considered: (1) There would have to be unanimity among

a11 groups.

(2) Would more pressure be generated on Washington

by a series of local situations rather than by one mass march

on Washington.

King answered at length and was in favor of one

mass march.

He said he envisioned such an event would create

such an impact that "something would have to give." He again

for such a move. Levison

then agreed "The time is now."

During the discussion, it was indicated that

Clarence Jones had attended a meeting at which the

to Tearn what was guiug vu aud neiy keep order. He indicatea that..

he would keep us advised of any information which he learned and which

of organizations participating in the August 28 demonstration.

RE:

MAJOR JOHN D. SILVERA

(4) On discussing various views held by the American Negro as

known to Mr. Silvera,

he told me quite frankly that the American

Negro does not hold the FBI in high esteem.

I asked why this was

He replied that for some reason or other both the uneducated

and the educated Negro have received the impression that the

FBI has favored southern, law enforcement officers whenever they

relative to the hiring of

Negroes.

I Clearly explained to Mr. Silvera what our employment

policy is. Additionally,

I pointed out

the article on the FBI in

the recent past in "Ebony" magazine, as'well as other matters on

the same theme.

Mr. Silvera stated

that all he was

doing was

reporting what

is known to him concerning the Negro's cutlook on

the FBI and that while he did not share this view he felt he

should report accurately and as it is known to him.

Mr. Silvera

went-on to say that he has always had the highest regard for the fBi

and, as a Major in the Reserve Offices of the U. S. Army Military

Intelligence, he long has had great admiration for

the accomplish-

ments of the fBI in the intelligence field.

(5)

MX.

Silvera told me that when he went through basic training

in the Army he became very well acquainted with James Jackson, a

Negro official of the Communist Party, USA.

We discussed Jackson

for: some time.

He indicated to me that he thought it might be

possible for Jackson to be defected from the Party.

I asked him

woula he be willing to try to defect Jackson.

yes, he

would, and also Ben Davis, whom he knows quite well. I told him

not to take any specific steps until I discussed the matter with

him

again.

(6) Mr. Silvera told me that he has learned that the Black Muslims

asked him if he had any specific

evidence on this point.

He said

he did not at the time, but upon

returning to New York he thought he could develop this

evidence

and would be very glad to furnish it to the FBI.

Mr. Silvera also

told me that be plans to join the

demonstrations in order to help

keep the order and to learn what is going on.

He volunteered to

furnish the FBI with all information of intelligence value which he

develops prior io and during the demonstration; I thanked him for

" his willingness to do this.

A review of the Bureau indices fails to show anything of e

derogatory nature concerning Mr. Silvera.

SUBJECT:

AUGUST 28TH MARCH ON WASHINGTON

REQUEST FOR PRESS PASSES

Bly atte

Tint

This memorandum is being prepared pursuant to your instructions

following a call to your office by Mr. Edwin Guthman of the Department late

yesterday afternoon.

Mr. Guthman advised that the Metropolitan Police Department

regularly receives requests for press passes from newspapers throughout the

country so that their representatives may cover special events in Washington.

He said that the practice of the Metropolitan Police Department

in regaid to these ¡êyuests is to häve Mi. Ben Gilveri, vue vi the cuiturs vi lie

Washington Post, screen the names submitted to the police to make certain that

they are not objectionable and are acceptable to the Washington Press Corps.

Mr. Guthman said that in connection with the 8/28/63 march on

Washington the police have received a letter signed by Eric Bert, managing editor

of "The Worker" in New York, requesting passes fir several individuals allegedly

affiliated with the paper. This request was turned over by the police in accordance

with their usual custom to Gilbert who in turn called Guthman to ascertain if it

was satisfactory with the Department for such passes to be issued. In connection

with these passes it is noted that the holders of such are allowed to cross streets,

police lines, and are given other courtesies normally afforded other working press

and not to the general public.

41-1000

Mr. Guthman said that Bert in his letter requested passes for the

following individuals:

M. A. Jones to Mr. DeLoach Memo

RE: AUGUST 28TH MARCH ON WASHINGTON

All of these individuals, of course, are well-known communist

officials and we have prepared a brief resume as to their identity and background.

This is attached.

This attached data regarding these individuals has been furnished

to Guthman by your office. Mr. Guthman has further been told that as far as

the FBI is concerned we can see no reason why they should have the requested press

passes or be furnished any other courtesies. It was pointed out to Guthman that

the Communist Party, its officials and its members have defied the Attorney

General and the United States courts by refusing to register as directed under

the Subversive Activities Control Act. It was also stressed to Guthman emphatically:

however, that a final determination as to any action must be made by the Department.

RECOMMENDATION:

For your information.

On 8-13-63 ASAC Roney of our New York Office called and

stated that on 7-30-63 the New York Office had contacted A. Phillip

concerning a shinsto the

Randolph, head of the Sleeping Car Porters Union, for information

concerning the March on Washington.

Randolph is Director of the

March on Washington. At that time Randolph called Bayard Rustin,

Deputy Director of the March on Washington, into his office and

introduced him to our Agents. Randolph stated that Rustin would

furnish the Agents with information concerning the March. Rustin

said that he hoped he would have a chart available on 8-16-63 which

would show information concerning the March, such as the busses and

trains to be used by the various organizations sending delegations to

Washington. The Agents thanked Rustin and told him that, if they still

needed the information on 8-16-63, they would be in touch with him.

Roney stated that, in view of Rustin's background (he is

reported to have been a member of the Young Communist League in 1936

and to have been arrested on a morals charge in 1946 and again in

1953 in addition to a number of other arrests), he recommended we not

go back to Rustin for any information.

OBSERVATIONS:

The press has recently published accounts of Rustin's former

connection with communism and his arrest record. In view of this

publicity, it is almost certain that Rustin will be called before a

Congressional committee especially since he is Deputy Director of the

March on Washington.

I feel it would be embarrassing to the Bureau if

Rustin were in a position to testify that he had cooperated closely

with the FBI by furnishing us information concerning the March on

Washington. Rustin would probably seize on such a statement if

given the opportunity.

= r

Therefore, I agree with ASAC Roney that no contact should

be made with Rustin

asking him for information concerning the March

on Washington.

We can obtain the necessary information through

other sources.

Attached teletype dated 8/11/63 sets forth the results of tha

conversation between Martin Luther King, Jr., and one Ted Brown, not

further identified.

Discussing the forthcoming "March on Washington" scheduled for.

8/28/63,

it was mentioned that Burke Marshall, Assistant Attorney General,

CIViL Rights DIViSIOn,

as well as the Attorney General are scared because

of possibility of violente in connection with the march. Brown indicated

concern as to

the number of participants in the march from Washington

stating

thai he foli the response was nut going to be guou.

He suggested the

è best

way to get them to participate would befor the President "to let them have aha

day off."

Also discussed was possibility that some of "the Southerners,"

not otherwise identified, hope to expose oné Bayer through a combination of

trying to show past connections with the communists and involvement in morals

charge. It was indicated that what-they (the Southerners) plan to do is to

challenge the statement that Attorney General made where he said that the

civil rights leaders were not comnunists. Brown mentioned that "the Soath-

erners" planned to call the Director and

ask him or make him produce the FBI

files on Bayer.

Brown hoped Bayer"don't take a drink before the march"to

which king agreed adding "and grab one little brother, cause he will grab

one when he has a drink."

The Bayer mentioned above is possibly identical with Bayard Rustin.

described in the "washington Post" on 8/11/63 as Deputy Director of the

committee planning the 8/28/63 march on Washington for "jobs and freedom."

This article described Rustin as having joined the Young Communist League (IC

in 1936.

According to Rustin,

he broke completely with the YCL when the YCL

accepted racial segregation in the Armed Forces after Hitler

• attacked Russia.

This article also described Rustin as having been convicted in 1953 on a

morals charge..

Rustin is reported to be an ardent pacifict, 'having been

affiliated with a number of pacifist-type organizations.

He has been active

in numerous picket lines and demonstrations and other agitations against

milltary conscriptions and racial segregation. He has been arrested on

several

occasions for activities in the above connection.

He was convicted

in 1944

for violation of the

The 7/11/63 directive refers to an article

appearing in the 7/7/63 issue of "The Worker" by James E. Jackson.

the directive describes this article as a major statement bearing on

the Party policy in the Negro struggle. The directive urges Party Vl!

"The Worker" article, which briefly comments on the major

organizations of the Negro people, refers to the current Negro struggle

as a revolutionary movement expressing itself in mass meetings, railies,

marches and sit-ins,: The article states that the enemies of this move-

ment are the "Dixiecrat" politicians and "Northern Republican ultra-

Rightists" whose political power depends upon the continued disen-

the Black Muslim movement and states that the Nation of Islam serves

the interests of the enemies of Negro freedom, Jackson attempts to

show that any form of anticommunism can only divide the groups involved

in the Negro movement.

OBSERVATIONS:

REG. 25

These directives are possibly

an answer to the Recent, concern

of Party functionaries over the lack of CPUSA influence and 'participa-

tion in the current Negro movement. By Bulet 5/17/63 all offices

comprising the CPUSA Southern Region were alerted to Gus Hall's desire

to employ an organizer for work in a current, active integration group.

By Buairtel 7/18/63 pertinent offices were alerted to Party efforts to

Influence integration-seeking groups.

The Bureau-will continue to take

any necessary action to remain on top of this situation.

Pursuant to Mr. Tolson's instructions there is set forth

herein an outline of the plans of the Domestic Intelligence Division

the civil rights March on Hashington, D. C., scheduled for 8/28/63.

stated at a meeting of CPUSA functionaries held on 7/11/63 that the

the present time. At the same time, it would be unrealistic to

By airtel 7/18/63 we instructed the field to be extremely

alert to data indicating interest, plans or actual involvement of

the Party in the current Negro civil rights movement, including the

scheduled 8/48/63 March on Washington.

In the event

any communist

groups are slated to participate in the march, we will attempt to

have some of our informants accompany the groups to report on the

Party's plans and activities.

All pertinent information received relating to communist

participation in the March will be promptly disseminated to the

Department and other appropriate Government agencies and steps will

be taken to insure that the Metropolitan Police Department is apprised

of all pertinent developments in this regard.

It is anticipated that the presence of 100,000 people in

Washington, D. C., during the March will cause tremendous traffic

congestion

In order to prevent any

RACIAL MATTERS

There is attached hereto a memorandum to the Attorney General!

and a letter to P. Kenneth O'Donnell, Special Assistant to the President, :

concerning information which we have obtained from a confidential source in

New York. It pertains to stanleyflevison, a New York attorney and a secret

member of the Communist Party as of March, 1963

King, Levison and presumably A. Philip Randolph, president of the

Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, apparently are going to join in a march

on Washington which they feel will bring nation-wide attention to the question

of the Negio.

The information also indicates that King knows of Jack O'Dell (also

known as Hunter Pitts|/O'Dell) who is considered to be a member of the National

Committee of the Communist Party. King has asked Levison to get some

statistics on the annual income of the average Negro family as against the

annual income of the average white family. He apparently wants to use these

statistics at a luncheon which he is to attend in New York City on the occasion

of the commencement exercises at City College in New York.

A memorandum to the Attorney General and a letter to Mir. O'Donnell

are attached for approval.

Honorable P. Kenneth O'Donnell

It was "Phil's" opinion that perhaps the march of

his organization and that proposed by Reverend Mr. ling can

be joined in the immediate future.

Levison suggested that

Reverend It. King attempt to contact Randolph as soon as

possible in order to discuss this matter in detail.

Clarence johes, mentioned above,

is currently

the Acting Executive Director of the Chandi Society for

Human lights.

Another confidential source has identified

a photograph of jones as the person whom he knew during

Late 1953 or early 1954 to be a member of, and in a position

o1 Leadership 1D,

the hanornlouth league.

The Labor Youch

13f Levison along with Jack p'Dell (also known as Bunter Pitts

4010011) would be able to get some statistics on the annual

income of the average Negro family as against the envuri

incume of tne average white tamily on a national level and

also for some Southern statea like Alabana.

Reverend

Hiro King would like to use these statistics at a luncheon

In New York City on June 12, 1963.

Levison stated that he would attempt to get these

statistios along with Jack O'Dell and pointed out that the

main point on these statistics is that the gap beiveen

Negro and white incone today is greater than the gap that

existed between Negro and white income during the depression

days.
