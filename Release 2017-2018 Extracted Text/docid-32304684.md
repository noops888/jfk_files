RELEASE IN PART

ReRomelets 2/10/64 and 12/27/63.U TOTAL DENIAL

On 1/24/64 Mr. Henry A. Falcher, Immigration and Na-

turalization Service (INS), American Embassy, Rome, Italy, ad-

vised that his INS representative in Palermo, Italy, had heard.

that an individual who had broken the Mafia code of silence,

Simone Mansueto, was indicating that he had some information which

would be of value to Americans. Mansueto is the unnamed individual

who is mentioned in paragraph 2 on page 2 of relet dated 12/27/63.

In the basis of the information received from Mr.

Falcher,

Dr: Aristide Manopulo, Central

Bureau, Criminal Division,

Italian National Police, Rome, was requested on 1/28/64 to arränge

For the prompt interview of simone dan to determine what in-

Iormation he might have of interest tổ

how slight or unimportant such information might seem.

On 3/3/64 Dr. Manopulo advised that Mansueto had been

interviewed as requested.

During the interview Mansueto denied

having any knowledge of any matters such as stowaway passengers,

contraband, drug traffic, or any other matters which would be of

interest to U.S. authorities.

Dr. Manopulo

noted that Mansueto

is the principal witness in the trial of AntoniAscalici and 26 ITALY

other individuals.

In connection with this trial, Mansueto is

under constant surveillance by Italian police because of serious

threats which have been made against him.

The noteworthy efforts of the Italian police and courts

to rid the country of the major evils of the Mafia are continuing.

In this connection, it is to be noted that the 2/6/64 issue of

Avanti, Italian language daily newspaper of the Socialist Party

of Italy, reflects that from the period October 1, 1963, to Janu-

ary 31, 1964, 217 persons were arrested, 379 warnings were issued,

and provisions were made for approximately 300 special surveil-

lances and compulsory detentions•
