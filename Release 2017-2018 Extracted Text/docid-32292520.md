center of organized crime and he believes there is some sort

of struggle going on for control of gambling, prostitution,

and narcotics.

Station WDSU broadcasted an "editorial" disclosing that the

station had learned of the beating administered EDMONDS by

The announcer then referred to HOGAN'S

crime and implied a connection between HOGAN'S statement

and the beating received by EDMONDS.

On March 15, 1963, NO 1207-C, who is an active

bookmaker and

gambler

in Jefferson Parish who regularly

frequents the Town and Country Restaurant and Lounge, furnished

the following information concerning the beating received by

EDMONDS. The informant talked to one of the bartenders at

the Town and Country Lounge shortly after the beating incident

caurred, about 4 or 5 a.m., March 10, 1963. The bartendel

normed him that EDMONDs had been drinkine considerabl

and had been in the lounge with a very young girl who appeared

to be about 17 years of age.

While EDMONDS and this girl were

in the lounge, an elderly man accompanied by a younger man

entered the lounge at which time the girl ran from the lounge

into the restaurant.

EDMONDS accompanied the elderly man

and the young man out on to the parking lot in front of the

lounge at which time the elderly man struck EDMONDS in the

face causing EDMONDS to fall to the ground. Thereafter the

younger man administered

a severe beating to EDMONDS, picking

him up off the ground and striking him several times and kicking

EDMONDS while the latter was lying on the ground.
