Dear Mr. Miller:

Attn: Mr. Johnston

The Select Committee staff has expressed particular

interest in a review of U. S. policy towards Cuba beginning

after November 1963 and culminating in a meeting with the

President on 7 April 1964.

In response to the Committee's request, appropriate

files

were searched.

on

which final Agency positions were based could not be

located. There would be no reason to retain them.

It is

our understanding that the Committee staff has already had

access to final Agency papers on this subject as submitted

to the White House.

Furthermore, an Agency officer reviewed with a

Committee staff member the pertinent parts of the files

of DCI John A. McCone who was the most senior, knowledge-

able Agency official involved in the policy decision.

This letter is to notify you that we believe we have

responded fully to the request.

Sincerely,

Wast Elder

Dear. Bill:

(S) In further response to your letter of 8 April 1976 concerning

possible Department of the Army connections with the Second National

Front for Escambray and Alpha 66, I am forwarding the first of the names

of Army personnel identified as involved in intelligence operations with

Alpha 66 members by the attachment..

(S) I am sure that you will appreciate that interviewing individuals

who have been deeply involved in this type of intelligence operation poses

continuing risks from public exposure to both the former sources and case

officers.

(S) If the Committee or the Staff decides to interview Hubbard, the

Army has requested that they be allowed to have an observer present during

the interview.

Also the Department would want to review any part of

testimony taken in the connection if it is to be released beyond the

Committee or to the public.

(U) This information is provided with the understanding that it

will retain its present security classification.

Please call if you have

UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS

WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Reference is made to the April 28, 1976, letter of the SSC

containing requests for material from the FBI.

Delivered herewith is material responsive to item number.

seven of that letter which pertains to communications between

November 22, 1963, and December 31, 1964, from FBI Headquarters

to field offices and Legal Attaches concerning the investigation of the

assassination of President John F. Kennedy. In accordance with the

request, this response does not include isolated communications to

single offices that relate to particular investigative leads. It contains

general investigative instructions which were sent from FBI Head -

quarters.

No response is being made to item four of the April 28, 1976,

letter which requests "All materials reflecting that FBI sources

familiar with activities of the Cuban government, Cuban officials,

Cuban intelligence, anti-Castro groups, or pro-Castro groups (either

within or without the United States) were questioned during the FBI

investigation of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy." A

search for such materials would involve the review of voluminous

records, which would be impractical. As can be noted in the response

to item seven, instructions were issued for contacts of all informants

and sources. Results of contacts with sources familiar with Cuban and

Castro matters would be scattered throughout not only assassination

files, but numerous other Cuban and Castro files. Additionally, if

questioning of sources produced no pertinent information, if would not

necessarily have been reported to FBI Headquarters by the field offices.

1976, requesting delivery of FBI materials concerning

FBI investigation of certain Cuban exile groups in the

United States, and SSC letter dated April 29, 1976,

specifically designating materials to be delivered.

Material responsive to the April 15, 1976,

request was voluminous and much of it required third agency

clearance. During a conversation between SSC Staff Member

Paul: Wallach and Special Agent Sammy J. Miller of the FBI;

an agreement was reached whereby access to the excised

material would be granted and subsequent request for

specific materials would be made. This was done as an

accommodation to the SSC to expedite handling of the request.

By SSC letter dated April 29, 1976, delivery

of certain documents from the original:

material compiled

was requested. This memorandum effects delivery of a portion

of these documents. The remainder will be delivered upon

receipt of third agency clearance.

In response to the portion of the April 15, 1976,

request set out in paragraph 6, the following Special Agents

handled the investigations of the Cuban exilengroups

specified in the request:

20510

Dear Senator Sahweiker:

This is in reference to your letter to the

Attorney General datad May 6, 1976, in which you

inquired as to why certain material possibly relating

to CIA assassination plots was not delivered to ther

Senate Select Committee pursuant to the request of

Senator Church dated May 12, 1975. Upon receips ename

your letter the Bureau was asked to determine why

materials were not discovered and reviewed when the

initial response to Senator Church'e request wags,

prepared:

The primary reason, according to the Bureau,

is that the FBI does not have a topical index to its

filos.

This means that Bureau personnel have to use

own judgment to determine where the requested

materials are likely to be located.

With reference

to the request relating to assassination plots, the

FBI decided to review 80 volumes of files raflecting

the relationship between the Bureau and CIA between

1958 and 1965.

The juraau and Select Committee staff

ambery Andrew Postal and David Bushong also reviewed

the volumas of a fila relating to Cuban matters.

The

limits of the Bureau's retrieval capabilities and the

problems involved in locating all relevant materials

parexplained to the SSC Staff members at that time.

tionally, the Committee has often been in

Hon of information that would asgist the

locating requested materials. In the past

I information was normally provided to the

BEA

assist in the preparation of a complete

respone..

However, I understand that with regard to

requests for assassination materials this was not done.

with regard to delays in delivering materials

recency requested by teh Committee, the Bureau has

acy-bedue that it is doing its best to respond to the

Committeels requests in a prompt, yet thorough, fashion.

One of the problems is that the Committee's requests

are numeraus and in many cases general.

This causes

the Bureau to tie up large numbers of personnel unnece-

ssarily and causes delay in responding to the Committee's

requests. In addition; third agency clearance requirements

also cause certain responses to be delayed.

Reference is made to SSC letter dated April 28,

1976, containing a request for access and delivery of

certain FBI material relating to the assassination of

President John F. Kennedy and plots to kill Cuban Premier

Fidel Castro. This memorandum is a partial response to

your request.

This memorandum effects delivery of material

which completes our response to Items 1 and 5b.

Per

conversation between Mr.. Paul G. Wallach of the SSC Staff

and Mr. Sammy J. Miller of FBI Headquarters on May 20,

1975, Item 1 material was changed from access to delivery.

This memorandum effects delivery of material

partially responsive to Item 3. Under this Item, only

material relating to 3d remains to be cleared by a third

agency. With respect to 3b concerning Morris Bishop, FBI

Headquarters files contain no reference to that name

during

the period 1962 to 1967 which, according to a conversation

between Mr. Paul G. Wallach of the SSC Staff and

Mr. Robert. D. Hampton of FBI Headquarters, is the period

in which your request is directed. There

are references

â€¢ to this name before 1962 which do not pertain to the

subject of this request.

This memorandum effects delivery of material which

completes our response to Item 8c. It should be noted that

CIA declined to clear several FBI documents containing CIA

information for delivery to the SSC. CIA advised that

This document is prepared in response to your request and is iot for dissemi-
