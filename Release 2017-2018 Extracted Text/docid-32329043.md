Note that MI-5 refers to certain information in

the enclosure which indicates that Laureano Batista had been

spotted off Racoon Cay, Bahamas, on 1/20/64, as a result'

which the British frigate H.M.S. Londonderry was sent to

intercept him.

MI-5 noted that

the Bahamas Special Branch

has been unable to trace any record of this incident having

lead to Batista's arrest which was how they had interpreted

the implication of the information.

MI-5 has requested

advice as to whether its interpretation is correct and if

any additional details of the incident are available (5)

COMM-FBI

As noted in the attached report the Bahamas Special

Branch are interested in this particular information as they

wish to be in a position to warn the subjects that their

involvement in anti-Castro activities is known to the

authorities and that they must not engage in such activities

while they are in the Bahamas. If there is evidence of the

arrest of Batista in 1964 in any Bahamian records the Bahamas

Special Branch would like to track it down so that this can

be used as

a basis for such warning.
