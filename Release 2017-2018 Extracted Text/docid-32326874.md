ADMINISTRATIVE

Following information furnished by CG 7046-PC.

On 1/22/68, informant advised that he was

acquainted with JOE MOSKOWITZ, aka JOE THE FURRIER.

He said

that he had met him in recent months through a mutual friend

and they had considered going into business together,

however they never found a suitable business to buy.

He went on to say that he was quite surprised to read in

the paper that he had been indicted along with WILLIE

DADDANO and others during December, 1967. Informant stated

that he felt that he knew MOSKOWITZ

well enough to convince

him that he should consider cooperation with the FBI.

On 1/26/67 informant stated that he had just

talked to MOSKOWITZ. He said that MOSKOWITZ more or less

took the position that he didn't care what happened and

said that he expects to go to jail.

He indicated that

his participation had been very little but that he

would have to pay for what he did. He also told the

informant that he did not know any of the persons involved

except PAT SCHANG..

He said that he had bought some stolen

furs from SCHANG a few years ago.

MOSKOWITZ told the informant that he was going

to think things over and might consider cooperation with

the FBI later.

It was the informant's opinion that

MOSKOWITZ appears to be afraid of the persons who he is

indicted with.

In several contacts with CG 7049=PC,

this informant stated he had been with ROCCO MONTAGNA and

FRANK DE LEGGE, Jr., and they had discussed how they

intended to "smear"

the government witnesses in the

pending cases.

This informant stated it was their

intention to accuse MICHAEL. LA JOY, JOSEPH D'ARGENTO

and PATRICK SCHANG of the murder of a Sears Roebuck

employee which occurred during a holdup at the Sears

Golf-Mill Store.

It was this informant's interpretation

of the overheard conversation that they intended to use

PAUL PANCZKO as a witness against these three government witnesses.

PANCZKO, who was reported as being involved, would be

granted

immunity for his testimony.

They planned to

push this case through Sears executives who have

offered a substantial reward for the solution of this

case and who are intensely interested in this matter.

On 2/2/68 AMERICO DE PIETTO entered a guilty

plea concerning his participation in the Hall Freight

Line theft of July 9, 1963., This conviction was reported

in referenced report of Special Agent FRANK J. FORD, dated

2/14/68.

As no previous correspondence had been received

by the Bureau concerning this theft, which was basically an

intrastate loss, a summary of the background and details

of this case is being set forth in this report.
