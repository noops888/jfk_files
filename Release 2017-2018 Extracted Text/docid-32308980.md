LA COSA NOSTRA

AR - CONSPIRACY

Re Bureau teletype to Boston, et al., 3/28/69.

Attached for the Bureau

are the original

and three

copies of an LHM treating of the "Philadelphia

Family of La

Cosa Nostra;" and the original and three copies of an LHM

treating of

the "Bufalino" Family of La Cosa Nostra

With respect to the existence of the "Bufalino"

Family of LCN, it is pointed out that the existence of

this

Family was not established through the use of electronic

surveillance.

PH 672-C-TE has advised that to his knowledge

RUSSELL BUFALINO is a Capodecina in the Family formerly

headed by THOMAS LUCHESE; however, NY 6436-C-TE has advisec

that JOE BARBARA, when living, was the head of his owr

"Family" and was

the Boss.

The "Family" which BARBARA headed

is now known as the "Bufalino Family,"

according to NY 6436-C-

TE.

Sad 12 1

New York has advised that NY 6436-C-TE is considered

by them to be a highly valuable and knowledgeable informant.

Despite this, the Bureau may not wish to go on record saying

there is such

a thing as the

Bug as the not:

"Bufalino Family" until such time

as additional corroborating

intelligence information is

available.
