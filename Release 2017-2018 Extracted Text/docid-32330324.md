SECKET

One copy of instant report is designated for

Washington Field, Baltimore and New York because:

(1) Washington Field and Baltimore - MASFERRER

is under orders to leave Florida and is delaying only because

he claims he is too ill to comply with the order at this time.

He has been ordered to depart for the Washington-Baltimore

area.

(2) New York - The New York Office has a pending

case in which MASFERRER was alleged to be preparing to head

an invasion of Cuba in January, 1960, and the possibility exists

that MASFERRER may go to New York instead of the Washington-

Baltimore area.

Two additional copies of instant report are

designated for Bureau for transmittal of one each to Legat,

Havana and Mexico.
