ZERILLI, POLIZZI and GIORDANO have refused to be

interviewed in ROSKIL, RICCA and LA PORTE are dead.

It is desired, therefore, that continuous inves-

tigation and interviews

be conducted not only with appropriate

Intormants, but with top hoodlums in an effort as previously

expressed to keep pressure on the hoodlum element in organized

crime to generate gossip among them in order to develop specif

ics relating to ROSELLI's homicide.

With reference to the Cuban aspect of the case in

which it was inferred that ROSELLI was murdered by CASTRO agents

in retaliation for his participation in assassination plots

against CASTRO, knowledgeable Cuban sources have advised that

the ROSELLI homicide was not carried out in a revolutionary

manner characteristic of CASTRO agents which would have required

that ROSELLI be shot down on the street and left there or blown

up in an automobile; in either instance the assassins would have

claimed credit for the

"hit"

â€¢ Cuban sources also have stated

that while not probable, it was possible that Cuban agents

might have caused ROSELLI's murder; therefore, investigation

will continue to explore this aspect of ROSKIL.

On 8/20/76, former MM 4205-PCI, a Cuban familiar with

Cuban intelligence activities, advised that E. HOWARD HUNT

could

be a knowledgeable source during the pertinent period

relating to the CASTRO assassination plot since HUNT was involved

as a CIA agent engaged in anti-CASTRO activities during 1960-61.

This source also suggested that former ambassador WILLIAM PAWLEY

would be cognizant of many of the personalities and events during

the pertinent period of the plots. This source identified GAETON

FONZI as an investigator in Miami, Florida, for U.S. Senator

SCHWEIKER. This source was aware that FONZI was utilizing

FRANK FIORINI, also known as FRANK STURGIS.

He offered as additional

sources of information

ANTONIO DE VARONA,

residing in New York City, and DE VARONA's

unknown to the source.

In accordance with Bureau instruction, no further

contact will be made with MM 4205-PCI.

Information furnished by MANUEL DIAZ has been found

unreliable for the most part. This was further confirmed by

a polygraph examination of DIAl. Since he has also undergone

psychiatric treatment, information and investigation initiated

by him will not be included in this report.

Similarly, infornation provided by SE 2434-PC does not

coincide with known

facts as they apply to ROSELLI.

This source

also encountered mental problems and information provided by

him will not be set forth.

Reports of the Dade County Department

of Public Safety in this matter will be set forth in Appendix

pages.

Toll call information because of its volume will be

handled by separate commnications.
