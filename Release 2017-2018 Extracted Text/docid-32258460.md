p. 2

During the 1920's, a

"group" of Italians was

organized in Dallas.

The "boss" was Carlo Piranio and

the no. I man under Carlo was Joseph Piranio who took

over when Carlo died in about 1930.

Members of this

group included Joseph Civello, Ross Musso, Frank Janni,

Ralph Patrono, Joe Civello's father (Phillip), Carlos

Campisi, Pete

Duca, and Ross Interante.

All of the

rackets in Dallas were at that time controlled by non-

Italians.

Civello identified one connection to East as Rocco

Pellegrino.

In late 1930's Civello imprisioned.

Civello told informant that gambling and prostitution

were extremely lucrative rackets in Dallas during the

1940's, but were entirely under the control of non-

Italian hoodlums.

The Italian group at that time

was not strong enough, nor big enough, to take over

Dallas,

"and Civello had noted that even an organization

from Chicago was unsuccessful when it tried to move in,

and take over Dallas."

Beginning in early 1950's; all organized criminal

activity in

Dallas came to an end.

Many of the Italians

in the 1940's invested in real estate, liquor stores,

and restaurants. Civello remarked that during the 1950's

p.? practically all of the original group died.

(Joseph

Piranio committed

sucide in 1956. Pete Duca died in

1949. Frank Ianni died in 1958, Philip Civello died in

1959.

Ralph Patrono died in 1955, Ross Interrante

died in 1953. Carlos Campisi died in 1964.

Civello

became the boss after Joseph Piranio died. Civello

is highly respected by most of the Italians in Dallas

and especially the sons of their dead

associates,

such as Johnny Ross Patrono, Joe Ianni, Joe Campisi, and

Pete Interrante.

Civello has requested:

slowly, but surely, get rid of all non-Italians from

the bookmaking operation.

Civello told

he could

not use Ianni because of his bad heart, and could not

use Joe Campisi because of his "big mouth."
