On 7/8/60, DL-6-S, in person, furnished

hand-

written report to SA W. HARLAN BROWN, dated 7/5/60, which

report has been serialized as 134-1A-526.

That report stated that BILL LOWERY phoned JOE LANDIN

and

asked LANDIN to translate a letter he had received from

DR. GARCIA, written in Spanish.

GARCIA in his letter told of

how one VINCENTE TREVINO had been shot and killed in an alter-

cation with a policeman, which was unjustified and unnecessary.

GARCIA in this letter identified himself as the State Chairman

Of "THE VINCENTE TREVINO MEMORIAL COMMITTEE."

He urged the

Chairman of the Dallas Forum to help form a similar committee in

Dallas.

GARCIA also stated that it is necessary for all Texas

towns

to have these committees for "the price of liberty is

eternal vigilance." In this letter DR. GARCIA outlined some

steps the committee should take.

That report also reflected that BILL LOWERY thanked

JOE LANDIN fOr his help and said he would take the case to the

Forum that night, their regular meeting night. He was thinking

of suggesting a dance, the profit going to the TREVINO family.

Informant had no additional information.
