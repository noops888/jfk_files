ADMINISTRATIVE

It will be noted that recently, the Phoenix Division

developed an informant, PX 696-C

who is very close to the

activities and associates of WILLIAM S. BONANNO, son of JOSEPH

BONANNO.

This live informant at this time appears to be in the

best position of anyone to possibly obtain information concern/

ing JOSEPH BONANNO's activities,

inasmuch as past investigation

has established that JOSEPH BONANNO is extremely secretive

and only through his son, who is at times loquacious is much

if any information received concerning this subject.

There is

also being used as an informant in the Phoenix Division the

personal physician of

JOSEPH BONANNO, who is carried as

¿ a Potential

Criminal Informant,

has in the past and is still utilizing his services, a real

intormantvestment

broker, who is carried as

' a Potential Criminal

Informant, l

I who has in the past handled some real estate

transactions for. JOSEPH BONANNO. During the recent past, however,

this informant has been unable to furnish any information of

value concerning this subject.

During the period covered by this report, the Phoenix

Division utilized highly confidential sources in the residence

and automobile owned by the subject, but no information of value

was received from either of these sources concerning any activities

or connections of JOSEPH BONANNO, with the "Commission".

As has

been previously stated, investigation has established that JOSEPH

BONANNO does nothing-in Arizona except reside in Tucson in the

role of a wealthy retired gentleman. Through the investigation

concerning his activities, there has never been developed in

the Phoenix Division or by other divisions of the Bureau

information to indicate that BONANNO has any "commission"

activity

whatever going in Arizona..
