Re San Juan teletype to Bureau and Miami, 5/11/65.

MM 639-S, who has furnished reliable information

in the past, on 5/12/65, advised that Comandos I (C-L),

about 1½ years ago, split into two groups. ANTONIO QUESTA

DEL VALLE and RAMON FONT SAUMELL took over the action

group of C-i and moved operations to San Juan, P. R.&

U.S. Customs, Miami, on 5/12/65, advised that

C-L action group of QUESTA and FONT has headquarters in

San Juan and may be contacted through HENRY FERNANDEZ SILVA,

652 Roosevelt St., San Juan, telephone numbers 724-7070 and

724-5923.

U. S. Customs said that C-L, for about the past

10 months, had been negotiating with the Government of

the Dominican Republic for permission to set up a base of

operations against Cuba, but, as yet, had not been given

any such base.

U. S. Customs and established sources in Miami

nave no information concerning the plans of the sever

C-L members at Jojuda, P. R.
