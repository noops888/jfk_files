NO 92-36

On August 3, 1967, BOS' GEORGE S. LEE, United

States Coast Guard Station,

advised

that CARLOS MARCELLO.

is a frequent visitor to Grand Isle.

LEE does not know:

where he stays

while visiting the island: LEE stated

that, during the recent Tarpon

Rodeo,: NAT CHIGHIZOLA,

Public Relations Director for Grand Isle, telephonically

contacted the Coast Guard Station and asked an unknown

Coast Guardsman to go down to the Marina and pick up

CARLOS MARCELLO and give him a ride to an unknown desti

nation. According to LEE, MARCELLO was temporarily

stranded on the dock and had called CHIGHIZOLA fOr &

ride, presumably to his camp.

LEE stated that he has heard, at the Coast

Guard Station that, when the Coast Guard vehicle arrived

on the dock and the Coast Guardsman approached MARCELLO

and told him to get into the vehicle, MARCELLO became

very scared and said;

"I surrender peacefully".

The

Coast Guardsman then

explained to MARCELLO he was merely .

giving him (MARCELLO) a ride..

This relieved MARCELLO.

LEE will attempt to identify this Coast Guardsman.

On August:

4,1967, Deputy Town Marshal, AMBROSE

BESSON, advised that CARLOS MARCELLO has been frequenting

Grand Isle for over 20 years and that he is well-known

and

well-llked on Grand Isle.

He stated that MARCELLO'S

closest friend on Grand Isle Is NAT CHIGHIZOLA. BESSON

stated that CHICHIZOLA was narried in Noyember, ARto, to

DOLORES OLSON, Ouner, Snak Shack, Grand Isle.

MARCELLO WAS NAT CHICHIZOLA'S best man and CHIGHIZOLA

and his wife honeymooned at MARCELLO'S Churchill Farms

Estate. CHIGHIZOLA is the Public Relations Director for

Grand Isle and owns the Nez Coupe Souvenir Shop on Grand

Isle.'

BESSON.

stated that Nez Coupe was a lieutenant of

Jean Lafitte,

the well-known pirate of the nineteenth

century in Louisiana, and CHICHIZOl is a direct decendent

of Nez Coupe.:
