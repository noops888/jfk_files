Re: Gambling Casinos

ending with the sentence,'Ve regard Mr. Mclaney as a thoroughly

dangerous

person who is likely to do nothing but barm to the

Bahamas." Fron this, it would appear New Scotland Yard has

considerable information already on Mclaney. You should con-

sult with them to determine if additional information is needed

concerning this person.

NOTE:

The Bureau, in cooperation with New Scotland Yard, has

furnished background information concerning U. S. citizens

who have, or have exhibited, an interest in gambling casinos

in Great Britain.

The information set out aboveis in answer

to an inquiry made by that agency concerning three individuals

from this country who have exhibited an interest in buying a

casino in London, England.
