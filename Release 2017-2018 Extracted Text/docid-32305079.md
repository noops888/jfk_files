his car to that location, but either to walk or call him,

and

he would have someone pick him up. Contrary to informant's

previous opinion, he was not required to make a trip that night.

not known to the informant.

In connection with the influence of the Calabrese group

headed by ANTHONY MILANO of Cleveland, CV 344-C gave the

following as an illustration:

He stated that in about 1958 he backed a sheriff's

candidate in Mansfield, hoping that if he was elected he would

be able to open a house of prostitution in Mansfield and within

the jurisdiction of the sheriff.

The candidate was elected

without any support whatsoever of TONY MOLLICA: He started his

nouse of prostitution, which was a money making proposition ano

shortly thereafter MOLLICA approached him and toid him that

people in town were talking and saying that he, MOLLICA, was

responsible for the house being able to operate and it was

giving him a bad name because

members" are not supposed to

engage in prostitution. Informant told MOLLICA that he had

nothing to worry about as he was not involved, and it then

became apparent that MOLLICA was trying to get part of the

operation and profit. MOLLICA then turned to MIKE ROMEO of

Poland, Ohio, brother of PAUL ROMEO of Campbell, who was a

friend

of informant's father, and ROMEO called on the informant on

behalf of MOLLICA. ROMEO told informant that he was. "out of line"

and was giving MOLLICA a bad reputation in that he had moved

into MOLLICA'S

territory.

ROMEO told CV. 344-c to close the

house for a couple of months so that everything would "cool" down.

Informant refused and told ROMEO he was not out of line and

secured his own "fix"

by backing the sheriff in the election and

the sheriff wanted nothing to do with MOLLICA and would not

allow him to operate anything. Informant stated he was mad about

this interference and then wrote a letter to his father in

Buenos Aires and later received an answer to the letter. with

the answer he was instructed to take the letter to PINDELLI's

good friend, ANTHONY MILANO in Cleveland,

"and according to

CV 344-C, he did this.

called by "WHITEY" BESASE,

A couple of days later informant was

who instructed him to come to

Akron to the home of JAMES LA FATCH for a meeting. He was told

to come there with MOLLICA, but informant refused

stating he was

not going to be

"dumped" en route or at the meeting.

He then

called MILANO in the presence of MOLLICA and told MILANO what

they wanted of him.

MILANO instructed MOLLICA that he was Instructing

"the kid" (the informant) to accompany him to Akron, and told

MOLLICA that if a

"hair on the head of PANDELLI" was harmed he

would see that the whole bunch was taken care of. Informant then

got on the phone and was instructed by MILANO to go to Akron

with MOLLICA and everything was going to be all right, and he would

not be hurt. Informant stated they went to Akron to JAMES LA

FATCH's home where about 20 persons were assembled. After

dinner, all except informant retired to the basement where !

MOLLICA and MIKE ROMEO were interrogated. Informant advised

MOLLICA, lied and denied that he had said what he had and ROMEO

became Infuriated and left.

Everyone shook hands with the

informant except

called to the Ritz Bar in Mansfield by MIKE ROMEO, and in the

presence of MOLLICA, ROMEO denounced MOLLICA as a "Har"

and asked informant to forgive him. After the meeting ROMEO-

told the informant that he could go to ANTHONY MILANO 1n

Cleveland and tell him that everything was all straightened out.

Informant then

went to D'AGOSTINO,

not wanting to bother

MILANO with süch small details, and gave him the information, and

D'AGOSTINO. told him he would

see that MILANO was advised.

He stated he had no further troubles with MOLLICA.
