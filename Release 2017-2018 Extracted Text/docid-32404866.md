e)

The ITEM #340 birth certificate is supposed to bo

an exact duplicate of the birth certificate issued

after her birth. This normally is issued several

days after birth because parents do not usually rush down

to register the birth of a child on the day of the birth -

not even in the USSR. ITEM #340 shows that MARINA'S

birth was registered on 11 Aug. 104l and that she

To Memorandun, submitted 14 Janary 1964, on the biography and documents

of OSWALD, Marina Mikolayerna (Dee PRUSAXOVA).

1. The following is presented as an expansion upon comments and

questiona presented in the original memorandun (see above) and in response

to specific requests from Agency personnel.

2. As noted and connented upon briefly in the original meno(see para 1).

there aro "suspicious gaps and discrepancies in her (Marina's) story regarding

In the Soviet Union (s00 12.2 $ 3.0.(2)-(4). (10) and (15)): Aspecial

from loe (dated 2 October 1961) which she received while in Khar'kor indicates

that she was worrying about losing ber husband: "I don't MiNk like that you

are saying that you feol that you are loging ne. You nover will lose mo.

That's that!" Marina should be asked about her relations with her husband

during that period; was this the influence behing her trip to khar'kov? Was

the decision to make the trip hers alone? Or did she discuas it in advance

of the decision? In short, we must investigate the details of this trip as

thoroughly an possible.

•

Do No loss attention, but fron a different angle, should be given her

trip to Moscow, uHAHHHM 9-14 July 1961, to joln bor husband. As noted in

Lee OSWALD's diary for that period, he had gone to Moscow "(without polico

permission)" to inquire about the retura of his US passport and to"nako

arrangenents for my wife to ontor the U. ". with ne." On 9 July ho called

Marina to join him in Moscow; on 14 July they returned to Minsk togother.

On 15 July, according to the diary. "Marina at work, is shocked to find out

they everyone knows she entered the U.S. enbassy...." Did Marina also

go to Moscow without polico permission? Did she not know that the Us embassy

continues: "Tho (blank) hold a neoting and give her a strong browbeating.

The first of many indocfrinations." ind how did this half-wise, half-naive

Anerican know at the time that this would i "the first of many indoctrinations?"

What did the OSWAlDs do In Moscow when not at the embassy? whom did they see?

Where did they go? Can Marina account for the whole of the time spent there?
