MM T-1 is CALVIN BARTON BULL, 220 31st Street,

Miami Beach, who appeared at the Miami Office or

1-29-68.

BULL said he had information concerning

the SNFE which he believed would be of interest to the

FBI. He indicated that he would be glad to furnish

any additional information which might come to him

through his association with RONALD LEE AUGUSTINOVICH.

Mr. BULL requested that his identity be concealed.

A new 134 file has been opened on BULL to

investigate his potential as a Security Informant.

AUGUSTINOVICH is the subject of Bufile 62-110031.

In 1961, he was active in Miami in an organization known

as

"Anti-Communist

Legionnaires", Bufile 2-1693.

WERBELL, formerly involved in the operations of

ROLANDO MASFERRER, is the subject of Bufile 62-108665.

With regard to the phosphorus, ammunition and

arms mentioned in the LiM, BULL advised on 1-31-68, that

AUGUSTINOVICH had implied that he would take BULL to

the location where the SNFE is storing their war materials,

within the next week or two.
