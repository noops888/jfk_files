FOLLOWING COMMENT IS MADE CONCERNING INFORMATION

I: OADR

IT IS POINTED OUT THAT THE MATTER OF SUBJECT'S PRESENCE

4191821

IN MEXICO IS SOMEWHAT DELICATE SINCE IT CAN BE ASSUMED THAT

THERE WERE PAYOFFS AI A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT

INVOLVED IN SUBJECT'S PRESENCE IN MEXICO FOR SO MANY YEARS.

IT CAN BE CONJECTURED THAT THIS ARRANGEMENT CAME

APART FOR

7-31717462

UNKNOWN REASONS LEADING TO SUBJECT'S EXPULSION. ANY INVESTIGATION

TO SPECIFICALLY RESOLVE THIS WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO OUR OPERATIONS

AND PROBABLY FUTILE.

1. THE HEAD OF INSPECTION SERVICE OF MEXICAN IMMIGRATIOWG14197A

ADVISES GIANGÄNA WAS ESPELLED AS AN UNDESIRABLE ALIEN; A SUMMARY

PROCESS UNDER

IMMIGRATION LOOKOUT LIST FOR YEARS AND COULD NOT TECHNICALLY

LEGALLY ENTER THE COUNTRY. pfUl

2. THIS SAME OFFICIAL ADVISED HE BECAME AWARE OF SUBJECT'S

PRESENCE IN MEXICO AND ORDERED HIS DETENTION AND EXPULSION.

THIS IS SOMEWHAT DOUBIFUL SINCE SUBJECT'S PRESENCE IN MEXICO

HAS BEEN PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE FOR SOME YEARS. CA!

3• SOURCES DO NOT KNOW OF ANY ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES ON THE

PART OF SUBJECT IN MEXICO AND DO NOT CONSIDER THAT HE WOULD

HAVE RISKED HE POSTEDY IN RESICO SY ANY SEEN ASTEVIE. S

•4. THERE IS NO INDICATION OF ANY FURTHER ACTIONS CONCERNING

THE SUBJECI ON THE PART OF MEXICAN AUTHORITIES. *

5. THERE ARE NO KNOWN BANK ACCOUNIS OR SAFE DEPOSIT BOXES

RELATED TO SUBJECI IN MEXICO. AS FAR AS IS KNOWN, ALL HIS

TRANSACTIONS IN MEXICO WERE HANDLED THROUGH HIS ATTORNEY JORGE

CASTILLO. ANY BANKING INFORMATION WOULD BE CONFIDENTIAL. HE

WOULD HAVE NO DIFFICULTY. IN RENTING SAFE DEPOSIT BOXES UNDER

AS SUMED NAMES.

6. THE MEXICANS HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DOCUMENT OR I AL
