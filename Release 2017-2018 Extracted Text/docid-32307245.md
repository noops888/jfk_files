EXCEPT

On April 18, 1955, CI HAV-Il advised that the Sans Souci Night

"Club, which includes a gambling casino and which is located on the outskirts

of Havana, had closed up on Saturday night, April 16, 1955.

Source said

that he had been informed that this closing had been motivated by'& desire

on the part of MArtinier and the Tropicana interest, which interests have

had 51 per cent of the operation of the sans souci during the current winter

, season, to squeeze out NOMANSA, FBI No. FBI No. 1525873e It will be

recalled that

ROTHMAN for the past several years has operated as the front

man and ostensible omer of the Sans Souci although he has always been

bankrolled by someone alse.

On March 19, 1955; source said that he had been Informed that

Peason •

Date

Source on April 18, 1955 advised that he had been informed that

TRAFFICANTE was coming to Havans on April 20; however, on April 19 source

stated that he had learned that TRAFFICANTE had moved up his arrival date

In Havana and had actually arrived on Apt 27, 1955-87(4964)

It is interesting to note that the Air Express edition of the

Miami Herald for April 21, 1955 reported the finding on Wednesday, April

20, 1255 of the murdered body of CHARLIE WALLg

described as "The 76 year

old elder statesman of the Florida underworld." The news account stated

that the body of WAll,, shot seven or eight times with a shotgun and with his

N

throat cut, iron ear to ear, had been found in his Tampa home by his wife

and' that he, had apparently been dead one or two days. It is not known

whether WALl's murder is in any way connected with the fact that TRAFFICANE

came to Havana on' April 17 after having previously announced to his friends

that

he would come to Havana on April 20J CAClU

on

April 20, 1955, NORMAN ROTHMAN, mentioned above, advised SA

CLARK D.

ANDERSON of this office that the Sans Souci had been closed because

the seasonias ever end, business was poor and that they wanted to do some

remodeling at the club.

This latter,

seems probably untrue inasmuch as it
