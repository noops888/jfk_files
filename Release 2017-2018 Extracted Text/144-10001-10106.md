INCREASED TENSION. IN HAVANA: FOLLOWING VENEZUELAN COMPLAINT TO OAS

3 Dec 63

co 0o

Confidential.

I wish to inform Your Excellency that.a certain tension

prevails in the Latin-American embassies accredited here, since

they think that the risk of a break-off. of relations with Cuba

has grown dangerously since the well-founded Venezuelan complaint

against Cuba because of her aid to the FALN and the resulting

convocation of the OAS. They think that ROMULO BETANCOURT,

while requesting hemispheric military action against Cuba in the

OAS, knows that he may not, or almost certainly will not, obtain

enough votes for his proposal. But such

would grant him

the authority then to demand and specify a total break of relations

with Cuba by the American States. The Brazilian Embassy believes

that Brazil will try not to go so far as to vote for a break, but

if the others approve it, she would have to follow the majority.

44USC2107(5)(g)(2)(D)

Tension between Cuba and Mexico has also increased suddenly:

as the result of a violent note which the Foreign Ministry hére

delivered to the Mexican Ambassador because of the detention in

Mexico City of a Mexican woman employed at the Cuban consulate

who was reportedly connected with the accused assassin of

President KENNEDY, LEE OSWALD. The Mexicans reportedly returned

the above-mentioned note.

The death of President KENNEDY, the Fidelista campaign to

incriminate U.S. Rightists in that assassination, lack of

knowledge as to the future direction of Washington policy

Venezuela and the threat of armed action or at least diplomatic

isolation and the immediate tightening of the embargo, the

knowledge that this country is behind the subversion in Venezuela

with arms and men' (the Cuban press, while ridiculing the incident

of the arms on the beach at Paraguana, gives no indications

whatever of indignation.

or repudiation of the Venezuelan accusa-

tion) have created a growing feeling of crisis. Cuban 'forces

continue with precautionary measures, and at dawn today there

was observed a large movement of military transports to the east

call-up of the militia.. On the other hand, the internal

counterrevolutionaries reportedly have been very restless for

four days in expectation of the OAS resclutions.
