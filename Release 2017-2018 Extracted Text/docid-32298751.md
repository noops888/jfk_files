Re SAC Letter 53-58 dated 8/25/53, and Pittsburgh letter to the Bureau dated

9/28/56.

On November 21, 1956, PG 545-6, who in the past has supplied reliable

infornation, advised SA JOHN S. PORTELLA that about one month ago he was

talking with "Hog" WILSON, Merwin, Pennsylvania, regarding an option on

640 acres of land, and after talking to WILSON he learned that F. S. MORAN,

a real estate agent in New Kensington, was also interested in the land.

Informant said he had heard that both

• the Aluminum Company of America ana

Westinghouse had this land site in mind for a research center and informant

could not understand MORAN's interest in the property. Informant said he

went to MORAN and talked to him about the property and MORAN denied that

he was interested in it in any sense. Informant said that on the same date

he went to SAM MANNARINO's office at the Nu-Ken Iron and Steel Company and

saw on SAM's desk a note from MORAN, who wanted SAM to call him back imme-

diately about the WILSON property.

Informant said he never connected MORAN

with the MANNARINOs until this incident. Informant said that since this

incident he has talked to MANNARINO, who has indicated that he does now

have an interest in the WILSON property. Informant described WILSON as an

old millionaire farmer who owns thousands of acres in the New Kensington

area and who also owns a large part of the Kiski Bank. Informant advised

that SAM MANNARINO is very interested in buying up large tracts of land for

cash. Informant said that MANNARINO recently purchased 300 acres at $100

an acre near Weinels Crossing and MANNARINO has told informant that he has

the inside track on the proposed New Kensington Airport site. SAM MANNARINO

also told informant that he has been getting most of his cash from his

brother KELLY MANNARINO and informant has no idea where KELLY is getting it.

Informant stated that gambling in New Kensington and surrounding area is

completely dominated by KELLY MANNARINO, brother of SAM, and this control

could account for KELLYis possession of large amounts of cash.

Informant suggested that the MANNARINOS' contact in the New Kensington

Telephone Company may be the sister of GENEVIEVE MORENO, who has a sister
