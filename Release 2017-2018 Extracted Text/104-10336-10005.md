Re:

Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board's Requests for

Additional Information and Records

Dear John:

I am writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious

concern about the status of CIA's responses to the Review Board's requests for

additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to

several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of

requests have not been answered - including some that were made more than two

years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be

forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now

extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct

a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the

highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)' and we request

that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests

be answered by April 1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal

requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for

information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the

following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

'As identified more fully below, the issues are: CLA-1 Organizational Material,

CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CIA-IR-03

HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CIA-IR-07 Claude

Barnes Capehart, CIA-IR-15 Electronic "take" from Mexico City, CLA-IR-21 DRE

Documents file: documents Nos. 496, 498, 499, 500, and 510. The Review Board

is awaiting confirmation that these documents are at HIRG for processing.

CIA-IR-05 Possible Foreign Source for Records on Oswald.

CIA was informally requested to use its contacts to pursue certain records

related to Oswald that were orally described to CIA. The Review Board

understands that the CLA has taken steps to pursue these records.

CIA-IR-06 QKENCHANT.

The Review Board seeks information regarding the purpose of QKENCHANT

and its connection with Clay Shaw, Howard Hunt, and Monroe Sullivan.

The Review Board was initially provided some information in regard to this

request that now appears to be incorrect. CIA is now seeking additional

information to correct or to clarify its previous answers. The Review Board seeks

an immediate, full, and accurate formal response to this request. Once the formal

statement is provided, this request will be complete.

**CIA-IR-07 Claude Barnes Capehart.

The ARRB staff has reviewed all records that CIA has been able to locate to date.

During the course of this review, additional questions were raised that ClA

agreed to pursue. CIA also agreed to conduct additional searches to determine

whether there may be additional retrievable records on Mr. Capehart. The

Review Board seeks a full and accurate formal response to this request. Once the

formal statement is provided, this request will be complete.

CLA-IR-08 Unredacted Copy of the "Family Jewels" Memoranda.

ARRB has reviewed a redacted version of the "Family Jewels." Additional

questions have been raised. At meeting between HRG, ARRB and the DCI/ IRO

on December 11, 1997, specific redacted pages were identified for ARRB staff

review. These pages should be made available as soon as possible.

(U) This memorandum is submitted in response to informal

Review Board (ARRB).

* *CIA-IR-06 QKENCHANT

a .

(U) Per the Review Board's request regarding the

purpose of QKENCHANT and its connection with Clay Shaw, Howard

Hunt, and Monroe Sullivan, the following information is

provided.

b. (S) KENCHANT was a project for obtaining clearances,

that is, Provisional Covert Security Approvals (PCSA) and Covert

Security Approvals (CSA), with the Office of Security in

connection with the acquisition of Corporate Cover for Action-

‹(CCA). In connection with the acquisition of CCA, Directorate of

Operations guidelines require that a (PCSA/SA be obtained in

most instances before a (corporate) entity can be used as a Cover)

Eor Action (CFA) sponsor?

C.

(U) With regard to Clay Shaw and his association with

the QKENCHANT project:

A review of Shaw's security file

indicates that he received a "five Agency" clearance on 23 March

Our records indicate the QKENCHANT project did not begin

until sometime in 1952, therefore, shaw in all probability was

not cleared by the QKENCHANT program.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Laura Denk

Executive Director, ARRB

FROM:

J. Barry Harrelson

JFK Project Officer, HRP/OIM

SUBJECT:

CIA-IR-06, OKENCHANT

1. QKENCHANT was the name of an Agency project used to

provide security approvals on non-Agency personnel and

facilities. Such approvals were required so that Agency

personnel could meet individuals to discuss proposed

projects, activities, and possible relationships.

2. Clay Shaw received an initial "five agency"

learance on 23 March 1949 and Agency records indicate th

QKENCHANT project did

not begin until sometime in 1952

Thus, in all probability he was not cleared by that program,

at least initially.

3. Monroe Sullivan, Clay Shaw's boss, was granted a

security approval in December 1962.

4. With respect to Howard Hunt, following his

retirement from the Agency, he went to work with a company

which had previously cooperated with the Agency. Hunt was

granted a clearance so he could deal with administrative

so he could dat.

matters in the absence of others within that company.

5. The Agency believes it has fully answered the

questions asked within this request and considers it

completed.
