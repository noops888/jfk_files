WEEKLY SUMMARY

MM 609-C and

advised in 8/62, that

ELUM ADDIE GAUDELL (Miami file 165-6) is back in the race

wire service business.

Filt

MM 509-C on 8/1/62, advised he received information

that JACK FRIEDLANDER (Miami

file 162-93), who is now working

in a Las Vegas, Nev., gambling casino, has been doing satis-

factorily and recently sent NAT/STALL, a Miami Beach Shylock,

$500.00 as part payment on a loan he made from STALL. He

also heard FRIEDLANDER also sent some money to JOSEPH

*INDELICATO (Miami file 92-404), another Miami Beach Shylock,

but he was not told how much.

These loans, he understands,

were the result of his wife's long illness.

He also advised on 8/8/62, that SOLXWAX, a "new-

comer" on Miami Beach, opened up Gino's Restaurant at 1906

Collins Ave. and at present the rear rooms are being re-

modeled in order to carry on some gambling and bookmaking

activities. He further learned that WAX, who is connected

with the "hoodlum element," purchased a four bedroom home at

5525 La Gorce Drive,

Miami Beach.
