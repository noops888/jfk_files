Analysis of LIFEAT Traffic Relating. to LIEIXG/3 fOI

the Feriod 19-26 Apr11, 1957.

1. In revlewing the traffic for the period indicated. Rowton fuzzd

valuavie confirnation of LIRING/3 and LIRING/4 contact with Ram=a

Abrou, Indicating that both persons complied with Rowton's suggertions.

LIRING/3'a telephonic contacts with Enrique Morales In Guatemala City

confirmed reports given to him (Rowton) before and after the eve=-.

The only item not reported to Rowton by LIRING/3 18 a dinner enfle-

ment which Enrique Morales had in Guetemala City on 25/4/67 with "friends"

of Morales' vijo, Esperanza. SAN-10 (17.5) also reveals that I5=30/3

and fiorales are engaged in some sort of deal for the purchase of purses

or briefcases (bolsas) either in Guatenala or San Cristóbal for rosale

1n Mexico City or import into the U.S. at a higher price. (LIEI33

mentioned the opportunitles in this line to Rowton previously, ba Row

ton did not react favorably)

2. The following are Rowton's comments on specific portions of to take

which will serve to clarify them l' relationship to reports made to him

by LIRING/3 and IIRING/4:

LIRING/4 Contacts with Ramiro Abrey: On 22/4/67, shortly after lowton

suggested that LIRING/4 recontact Abreu and attempt to effect torough

him a reconcillation with the local mission, LIRING/4 telephozed the

Embassy and attempted to reach Abreu. From the content and toze of ber

questions and ramarks, it appears obvious that IIRING/4 has not bad re

cent contact with the Cuban mission. She asks when Abreu is leaving for

Havana, but is given no information. She tries again at abort 1900 and

2000, but there is no answer. She finalli sets througa to abrez on

14-13-26 who promises to come to her home between 1000 and 1:00 the

following day (23/4/67).. She has to give Abreu the addrest, indicaiing

that be 1s not faulliar with the bone add-ess of LIRING/3 0J/1.

SAN-10 (5.0,8.2,12.2) reveal that Abreu called or talked to 1=ING/4

›un the telephone three times on 24/4/67. ITRIG/4 makes reference to

"so much analysis, so many thoories and ideas" which apparentiy vere dis

cussed between her and Abreu at their 23/4/67 conversation. her re

marks made both by LIRING/4 and Abreu indicate that Abreu 1s, or watna

1s substance by LIRING/3, although Rowton has not as yet hnd a chance

to talk directly with IIRING/4 to get her version of the conversationa

with Abreu. Apparently in order to put Abreu off (in bia lamorous de

81508) LIPIIiG/4 teals him on 25/4/67 that her husband auspects.

sonething is going on between shen. In reply to Abreu's anxious ques

tioning, LIRING/4 states that her huswand asked her whether she liked

Abreu and whether Abreu like her, to which she said that the replied is

the affirmative (this apparently was calculated to cool Abreu off.

without all nating him). Abrew's visit to the partment and his pro-

poed luncheon date with IIRING/3 were confinned by the latter in his

report to Rowton on 27/4/67•

Conversativns Re the Birth Certificate: In SAN-10 (2.5) IIRIKG/3 asks

bis(Guatemalan friend (Jacobo jodriguez Padilla?) whether It natterm 11

the hath certificate la for a person 10 years older? Jacobo replied

in the negative, but would prefer it of a persos ten years younger.LI-.

RDiG/3 promises to have the birth certificate in his posuossion by

2526/4/57. Ihis is the first confirmation Rowton has had of a state-

ment made to him some tro weeks previoualy that when he wont to pick us

the (false) birth certificate at Registro Civil on instructions of bis

half-brother (and the lawyer Folando Riojas) he discoverid that it was

jor a person born in 1916 and hence useless for binself. LIRING/3 also.

reported to Rowton that Jacobp had contacted him recently and asked for

hoip in obtaining false papers for himself. The above conversation:

therefore would indicate that WIRING/3 plans to sive Jacobo, the false

document originally procured for himself through his half-brother. II-

RING/3, bowever, has not revealed this plan to porton.

SA-11 (16.0) reveals that IINING/3 informed his brothar two days later

that he has spent over ten days at Registro Civil but it 1a "impossible

to get the birth certificate. The book no longer eximsty." He adds thes

he has written his half-brother a lotter explaining everything: LIRIlG/5

reportod to Rowton that he had asked his balf-brother to obtain an

"acta notorial" In lieu of brita certificate and hoped to have the doca-

ment soon.

as a wetter of fect he had not made any commitment to lorales and did

not feel under any obligation to continue to use him, even in the

business, especially. If Roston had any further reservations about bin.

2. Regarding

Sergio Gonzalez Marin of the Secretariat of

Commerce and Industry, LIRING/3 co:mented that, as he had reported pre-

viously to Rowtor, the latter had formerly been a member of the Communist

Party of Mexico, but was no longer active. LIRING/3 added that his sis-

Corcalon Morin; was a very active nember of the

Resty ud sayied tala Reiloreno, wao was also tost provably a somber

Silva and

excellent contacts in extreme leftist circles. LIRING/3 added that Sergio

Valdez was the son of the Slempre correspondent and associate of Alberto

a conversation with Raúl foreno,

with the FAR resporisible for Propaganda at the National University. iI-

RING/3 commented that such a person would surely know "Garcia" of PAR,

and that therefore he planned to arrange a neeting with him

at the first opportunity.

4. In preparation for a possible ICFLUITER examination of LIRING/3 on

9 or 10 May, Roxton stated to him at the end of the meeting that be was

preparing a nunber of questions that still bothered bin so that LIRING/3

could sive a definitive reply that would close the matter for once and

all. LIRING/3 replied that he was anxious to answer any questions Roston

might havo and hoped that this would resolve any problem and dispell any

lingering doubts that Ronton
