ERNESTO ARAGON, 233 East 69th Street, NYC, advised on

ARAGON stated that he and Dr. VARONA met

with ROBERT W. HALI of Glenside, Pennsylvania at the hotel at

about 6:30 p.m. and spoke with him for about a half hour.

ARAGON advised that HALL agreed to turn over the blueprints of

the communication system which he had installed in Cuba from

1956 to 1959 to ARAGON.

ARAGON advised that HALL was introduced to VARONA and

himseli by MANUEL A. GONZALEZ and SERGIO APARICIO.

ARAGON said

that HALL informed him that he had to do some work on the plans

and get all the papers together and that it would take him a

little while, but he would deliver them personally to ARAGON,

who would then turn them over directly to Dr. JOSE MIRO CARDONA

head of the Revolutionary Council.
