SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA, aka

ANTI-RACKETEERING

Milton.

Pittsburgh was authorized to install a microphone surveillance on

above-captioned subject by approval of memorandum T. J. McAndrews

to Mr. Rosen 1-25-61. Because of the technical nature of the installation,

SA B. L. Sutton of the FBI Laboratory was assigned to engineer details.

A MUTT transmitter, modified on the scene to handle a particular problem,

was successfully installed over Saturday and Sunday nights, 1-28 and

1-29-61. The signal was picked up at a secure location by a special

receiver and fed into a leased line to the office monitoring plant.

SA Harold L. Williams of Pittsburgh advised 2-2-61, that this

" line was put in on 2-1-61, and a fine signal was receivea.

This morning

the signal appears to be lost. Since technical modifications were made

on the scene to the equipment by SA Sutton and since no access to the

installation can be made during the week, it is not desirable to send a

Laboratory man other than SA Sutton to Pittsburgh to assist in this matter.

SA Sutton is presently in New York in regard to another technical matter.

His current assignment should not be of long duration; accordingly, when

he completes the New York assignment and returns to the Bureau, he can

modify another transmitter and be available to assist Pittsburgh further

in this case.

This program is satisfactory to Pittsburgh and will be followed

unless advised to the contrary.
