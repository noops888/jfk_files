assignment in Mexico In November, 1960.

In the Resident Agencies, all Agents handle both

criminal and security matters:

PRINCIPAL TYPES OF CASES HANDLED

The Mexico City Office handles practically every

type of case found in the domestic field. Most of the cases

fall into the following general fields:

Criminal cases, the great majority of which have

to do with Bureau fugitives, Selective Service violators

and automobiles and other property stolen in the United States

and brought to either Mexico or Central American countries.

Also included in this category are police checks made for

the Embassy and other U. S. Government agencies.

These are

handled as a gesture of

cooperation with the Embassy and to

avoid interference by representatives of other Goverrment

agencies in our dominant control of the police liaison in

Mexico.

American communists, Including a number of Security

Index subjects who either reside in or visit Mexico.

Border coverage (BOCOV).

States.

Cuban matters, Including travel to and from Cuba

of U. S. cItizens and Intelligence concerning Cuban activities.

Espionage matters.

Due to the presence of a large

Soviet diplomatic establishment in Mexico City, as well as

several satellite diplomatic establishments, this is considered

one of the most important phases of our work here. It has

appears to be getting any good, hard Intelligence concerning

the Cuban internal situation on a current basis.

He instructed

me that the Mexico City Office should intensify

its coverage

on Cuban matters, and this is being done.

At the present time

three Agents in the headquarters city spend about one-half of

their time on Cuban matters. One of these three Agents

dedicates the major portion of his remaining time to following

related Latin American matters and to handling physical

security checks of the telephones in the headquarters and

Resident: Agent offices and in the homes of personnel. The

major portion of the remaining time of the second Agent is

dedicated to the handling of the activities of a portion of

the national subversive organizations in Mexico and Chinese

Communist matters, as well as replying to name check requests

name by various Embassy offices.

The third Agent handling

Cuban

matters in addition handles the major portion of the

Ispionage investigations in the office, including the very

important LAROB?and OXBLOOD double agent cases,

and follows (5)

the activities of' Soviet and satellite diplomatic establishments

in Mexico City.

4.

Almost the entire time of one Agent is spent on

following, through informants, the activities of American

Communists, including a number of Security Index subjects, who

It is felt that this coverage

has a vital direct bearing on the internal security of the

United States and should be continued. Through this coverage

it has been possible recently to come up with some highly

valuable information concerning a clandestine leadership branch

of the Mexican Communist Party. The activities of this group,

which activities are apparently unknown to the rank and file of

apparently unk

the regular Mexican Communist Party, are pointed toward the

take over of the Mexican Government from within in the next

five to ten years.

The effect of such a take over in terms of

Mexican-U.S. relations and on the internal security of the

United States is obvious.

So far as is known, neither the CIA

nor any other U.S. Government intelligence agency here had

received any information

on this clandestine leadership branc

of the Mexican Communist Party.

5. As was pointed out above, three Agents are assigned

full time to criminal matters and to maintaining open liaison

with official government agencies, and the Number One Man

supervises all criminal cases

and handles a substantial caseload

in the criminal field. It is felt that the statistics set forth
