SUBJECT!

Report of Interrogation of 6 August 1985

Today's session was from 1000 to 1200 und from

1305 to 1410.

As planned, ( started the session by u

marizing for subject the resulta of the firat sir sessions.

llating for him approximately twenty points on which he had

Iniled badly.

(Sunry list attachod.)

At first Subject

attempted to contest the points as I cited tben,

for exam

ple,

on the variatione in the robuLov story,

and on the

location of ROZHIKO's office, but when I

gave his the

facts be did not challengo then and be Ilatened to most of

the litany in silenco.

I told Subjoct that the resulte of

these sessions had confirned further the previous Ilndings.

I asked hin why he continued to cling to bis legend, and

reninded him that he had turned dom the opportunity

olfered to him last spring to change bis mind while ve

st111 could tate steps to preserve hia operational useful

108B•

I anld that thie opportunity us now past, but that

I did not vant to conceal from him the fact that be still

had knowledge and information which could be useful to u.

However,

there was actine limit even to this.

I reminded

him that be had been out of circulation for a long time

and that many things had happened in the world and especially

in the Soviet Union during this tine; for example, KIRI-

BICHEY was no longer in power (Subject's comment, as •*-

pected, was "Thank God!").

Otber changes had taken place.

If Subject did not make up bis mind to tell the truth, hin

190 days could enstly turn Into 4000, and he would not be

of interest to anyone.

I told Subject again, that he had

nothing to fear, no matter what he had done in the past,

that vo vould not prosecute him for any past crimes, no

matter how bad.

If he vere worried about reprisal from

Sovlot security organs, I told him that ve vere just am

capable of keeping his confession secret as ve were uf keep-

ing socret the fact that we knew he was a provocateur for

• year and a half before his defection.

I promined him

takes on ninor points of detail owing to forgetluness

and that he would continue to tell nothing but. He sal

that despite hia grievances over his trentment be con

tinued to be liliez to serve American Intolligence in any

way be could, short of returning to the USSR, of course.

He complained that I denied and contradicted everything

Bo sald, great and saall, and said that be could see by

many remarks that I had ande that I thought that he had

never served in the KGB an a staff officer but had perhapa

bees an agent for tho KGB.

This, he said, was completely

excluded,

aad I should know that it la not possible for

the XGB to recrult the son of a ainister as an agent.

replied simply that l luer a several cases more not coly

childron of miniaters but even moro important people had

served in thie capacity.

Another Interesting reurk that Subject de vas

that he fully approciated the fact that his knowledge vas

rapidly cotting dated. He mntloned that this appled nor.

only to his knowledge of the KGB, but also to what he

knew about prominont mombers of the Central Committee of

the CPSU®

I said that he had not provided anything of

Interest on this subject, and he replled that there had not

been an opportunity,

Implying that there was nch that be

bad to offer in this fiold.

It is planned to explore him

knowledge on this next week.

Subject complained that we had not checked his

story sufficiently and pointed out that thousande of boya

had studied in the same schools as ho had and that ve

should be able to se: confiruation somewhere.

Here be made

an Interesting remark as follows:

'Incidentally, when I

Iirst came here I understood fron something that Mr. Peter

Earley said that you have operational contact with al

Fe was also in the Baku Javal Preparatory

Bchool with me."

5. Subject was questioned in some detall about hia

dutios as « SCD officer on the big public bolidays.

Sub-

ject's description vas generally accurate, and even quite

good as long as he kept his answers general.

Wher forced

to be more spacile he made a number of mistakes about the

procedures involved, such as Insistine that lnstructions

for the hollday vero issued by the chlet of the department

without the participation of a 9th Directorate officer.

nbout the preparation of the duty and quest liste for

passes, which lead ne to conclude that he did not stand

duty there as a KGB officer.

He was unable to remember #

single delegation that he had been assigned to watch, a-

though he maintained that he bad pulled such duty every

pear since 1957.

However, on the basis of his otberule

very good familiarity with Red Square and the procedures

of parades there, I would conclude that he has attended

more than one such event as i quest, or perhaps with bis

father.

6. Alter the luncheon brenk, I started to question

Subject os his first merriage.

As before, Subject was

unable on unwilling to remember any of the data that would

enable us to pia this story down.

He does not rember

•*nctiy ubon he not Tologins, the date of Telegin's arrest..

the date of the marriage, the location of the lAdS office

where the murringe was restatered, or even the year of

birth of als wife (1928 or 1929) •

Subject stuply made no

Offort to ansver these questions, and for this reason :be

estioning proceeded to Subject's first passport.

To

isked whore and when he received bia firet Internal

passport, Subject said that he thought it a ln loscow in

early 1944 before leving for Leningrad. Beminded that thu

was a change from bis previous story that he had gotten

his first passport in Leningrad, Subject replied that be

hadn't remmbered 1t, and that in any case he also got a

passport in Leningrad.

Asked to describe the purpose of

the interaal passport yates; sfubject's answer vould embar

rase any real SCD officer.

He insists that all Soviet

citizens over the age of 16, encept those on sctive milltary

mervice and prleoners, have passporte.

Asked to describe the surroundings of Ul Marodanya,

where ho lived Iron 1958 to biu departure, Subject's answer
