PETE LICAVOLI

WHITEY BESASE

Informant advised on 5/2/63, that he has been

well acquainted with the operation of YONNIE LICAVOLI? WIth

is presently in the State Prison in Columbus,

Ohio, and

PETE LICAVOLI, his brother,

who lives in Detroit.

Informant

stated that in order to understand the operations of the

they were going to have to take over by force

and kill

everyone who got in their way.

Informant stated ever since

they went into Toledo and

then took over Northern Ohio,

they have not tolerated any interference or competition.

He advised that as a result of this,

they control or have

contacts with every police department in

the major cities

and at the present time if a person wants to be in the

rackets, you are their partner or you don't operate.

Informant continued that in Ohio there 1s

one numbers house.

He stated in Detroit there are several

numbers houses and at the

present time the Negroes control

about 60% of the business.

Several years ago,

the Itallans

in Detroit debated whether or not it would be worthwhile

killing off the leaders of the Negro numbers operations.

This was vetoed by the old Italians because they realize

that while they could kill off the Negro leaders,

Negoes would in turn kill off several

of the Itallans.

The older Italians decided that the person who might be

killed would be them,

so it was decided that the extra

money that would be made would not be worth the effort.

Informant stated in Ohio this has not been true

killings mean little to the LICAVOLI group.

Informant stated

that if one would analyze

or follow the actions of the Italians who came with YONNIE

LICAVOLI to Ohio in the early 1930's, one would find that

each of these is in a controlling position in

a major city

in Northern Ohio.
