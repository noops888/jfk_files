on 6/2/64 MI 623-C-TE advised that he was told on

the previous evening by FRANK PETER BALISTRIERI, boss of the

Milwaukee family of La Cosa Nostra, and PETER BALISTRIERI, a

capo decina and brother of FRANK,

that an important meeting

would be held on 8/2/64 at the SAM BATTAGLIA farm in the

vicinity of Chicago and that representatives would be there

from New York and California.

Informant did not know whether representatives

from other areas would also attend nor did he know the purpose

of the meeting.

However, in view of the alleged retirement of

JOSEPH BONANO as a member of the commission, it 1s possible

that such a meeting might consider selecting a successor.

This informant previously advised that BATTAGLIA

farm at Dundee, Illinois which is used for conferences

as well as pleasure outings by La Cosa Nostra personnel.

Informant has never been to this farm and does not know its

exact location but he previously stated that the girl friend of

ANTHONY "NAGS" PANZICA frequently cooks for hoodlums who go
