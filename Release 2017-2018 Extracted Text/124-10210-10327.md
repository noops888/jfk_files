not know how the information had leaked to the press

but he assumed that there must have been some notice given to

newspapermen in the U.S. Because of this sudden appearance of

newspapermen, Guatemalan officials found it necessary to process

the subject's entry in a clandestine manner and in another building

According to

the newspapermen learned what happened

and some of the local writers began criticizing the Guatemalan

President for his involvement in the entire episode.

President's political opposition accused him of protecting a

hoodlum.
