"Source advised that several weeks ago he talked

with

a fellow prisoner, VERNON BUNDY.

VERNON BUNDY, an

Orleans Parish prisoner, testified in District Attorney JAMES

GARRISON'S KENNEDY assassination probe that he, BUNDY,

saw

CLAY L. SHAW pass money to someone on the New Orleans lakefront.

BUNDY indicated to source he had been offered a deal by District

Attorney GARRISON if he would testify to a story about SHAW.

According to source, this conversation allegedly took place

several weeks ago in New Orleans Parish Prison prior to the

time BUNDY testified at the hearing in Criminal District Court.

At the time of the conversation, BUNDY was undecided what

course of action to take but told source he indicated indirecti

anything to get out of his sentence.

his testimony was not true without

stating directly so, or

that a story had been given to him to tell."
