Re Miami airtel to Los Angeles, 12/13/63 and

reports of SA JOHN P. LENIHAN, at Miami, dated 10/11/63

and 12/13/63.

On 1/2/64, Departmental Attorney PELOQUIN tele-

phonically contacted the Miami Office from Washington, D.C.

He related he is boping to obtain some witnesses who might

testify to the "character, truth and veracity" of HARRY

BROOKS and ALDERISIO. He pointed out since BROOKS allegedly

has such a poor credit record that possibly individuals he

defrauded out of some money might testify to his "character,

truth, and veracity."

Page 18 of Miami report dated 10/11/63, relates

investigation conducted by Tampa Office in Cocoa

Beach,

Fla.

Tampa and Miami will make inquiry to locate

witnesses who might testify to "character, truth and

veracity" of BROOKS.

Chicago and Milwaukee attempt to locate witnesses

who might testify to "character, truth and veracity" of

ALDERISIO.

PELOQUIN stated he was reviewing some files on

ALDERISIO, Bufile 92-3141, Chicago file 92-415, Los

Angeles file 92-172, which relates interviews with LITBERG.

PELOQUIN stated in 1961 LITBERG was interviewed

by Los Angeles Agents and at that time he was living at

2029 S. Garth Avenue, Los Angeles, California, telephone

VE 7-9095. LITBERG was then employed at 9030 West Pico

Boulevard, Los Angeles, telephone CR 3-2810.

This is presumably an Anti-Racketeering investi-

gation on ALDERISIO in which Chicago is believed to be

origin.

Chicago forward copies of reports regarding LITBERG

interviews.

PELOQUIN stated he expects to leave for. San

Francisco soon but that his assistant HARRINGTON is planning

on going to Denver soon.

Information copy furnished to Denver in event

HARRINGTON contacts Agents there.

ALDERISIO SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS

SINCE HE IS ALLEGED TO CARRY A GUN IN A SHOULDER HOLSTER.

TRAFFICANTE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS DUE TO

HIS PAST ASSOCIATION IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES.
