Informant advised that he has been in frequent contact

with NICK DITTA throughout the previous

week. He stated that

DITTA claims to him to be in "bad shape" financially. He said that

he and DITTA have occasionally talked about "burn Jobs" but that

DITTA claims that he has been unable to come up with a "score".

Informant advised that DITTA gets "so much" money "in front" for

"burn job" and then he also gets a percentage of the

"burn ins

surance"

He revealed that DITTA told him that he was interviewed

by the FBI the other day and that DITTA apparently considered him-

self "real clever! when he complained to the FBI Agent that he

wished it was true that

that he com notake i

"backed" by the' Detroit criminal

syndicate as then he (DITTA) would not have all the bills that he

does.

Informant said that DITTA told him that he put on a good

"cry act" about his bills and that he even got them out to show

the FBI.

Informant advised that, to his knowledge, NICK DITTA does

not have any

checking or savings

account.

He said that he does

not believe

that DITTA has an account at

any bank covering financial

transactions of his carlot either.

He revealed that DITTA has

"nothing but iron" i e., junk cars, on his lot and that all of

DITTA's business is "out of pocket" anyway.

Informant advised that

DITTA

occasionally uses the Public Bank at Van Dyke and Seven Mile

Rd. for some type of banking transaction involving his lot, DITTA

AUTO SALES, 10400 Gratiot Ave.?

however

does not believe that

DITTA carries an account

at Public Bank.

Informant advised on 11/1/63, that he

was with NICK

DITTA most of that day.

He said that he bought a car from DITTA

at DITTA's used car lot and that he gave DITTA his Cadillac as a

trade-in.

He added that DITTA bought this car lot, which is

continues to bang around

Informant advised that NICK DITTA tOld him that he has

a "mooshine still""

exists in Detroit a gambling operation known as "night numbers"

Informant stated that the Detroit Italian syndicate has nothing

whatsoever to do with "night numbers", which betting is

confined

solely to the Negro Numbers operators

in Detroit. He added that

the payoff in "night numbers" is still the same, 500 - 1, however,

there is only one winning number each night and

this number is

taken from harness race results each Monday through Saturday even-

ings at Hazel Park, Wolverine, Northville and Jackson Park Harness

tracks.

Informant advised that another form of gambling presently

exists in the Detroit area which is controlled by the Detroit

Italian syndicate. He identified this gambling game as the Italian

Lottery.

He said

that the Italian lottery has been under the direct

control of "BLACK BILL" TOCCO for many years and that the Italian

Lottery was run by "the people" before they got into the numbers

racket.

Informant explained that the Italian Lottery sheet is sold

Monday and that the bettor picks

six numbers.

He added

that the winning number each week comes out of Italy. Informant

advised that there is no longer much "action" with Italian Lottery

tickets in Detroit, however, PATSY CUVELLO, the barber for many years

of the syndicate people, still has them in his barber shop in the

Glan Gables Apt. building, 631 Selden Ave., Detroit..

Informant advised that during the years that he ran a

"unit" for MIKE RUBINO in PETE LICAVOLI's numbers house he operated

under some very strict business rules.

He revealed that RUBINO

allowed him, and others in his "unit", to pick up any numbers

"business" or "stops" around

town that he wanted to with the

distinct ex ception of any numbers "business" belonging to JOHN

WHITE's operation or to the Murphy House.

Informant advised that

just prior to the time that he went to work for RUBIN he and

SAMMY GIORDANO were "in partners" in their own independent numbers

He said that he and "SAMMY G." were doing about

$3500.00 a day "action" too.

He stated that they used to "turn

in" around $700.00 to $800.00 a day numbers

layoff to a Negro

numbers man named CURTIS LEWIS. Informant related further that

in the early 1950's he used to be "in partners" with ODUS TINCHER

in an independent numbers house operation and that, even then, they

"turned in" numbers "layoffs" each day to CURTIS LEWIS.

Informant advised that each Friday morning prior to

8:00 a.M., EDWARD "TARZAN" CHRISTOPHERSKI leaves his apartment in

the Glen Gables Apts., 631 Selden Ave., Detroit, and he drives to

Lansing, Michigan, in his 1963 blue Ford convertible.

He stated

that he does not know any details regarding "TARZAN's" strange

Friday morning trips,

however "TARZAN" either is picking up a

"package" of money from some individual who lives in the Lansing

area who he has blackmailed or else "TARZAN" is picking up foot-

ball pool ticket bets from the Michigan State University campus.

Informant advised that in the numbers business in Detroit

it is customary that all big numbers "hits" are paid off in $100

and $50.00 bills. He furnished the following recent winning numbers

in Detroit:

In regards to this office's investigation into allega-

tions regarding PETE LICAVOLI and the range of LICAVOLI's activities

in the numbers business in Detroit, Informant advised specifically

as follows:

The "green sheet" is peculiar to the Detroit numbers

business and it has never been distributed in any other city in

the United States except Detroit.

He explained that the "green

sheet" would be useless anyplace

but Detroit because Detroit is

the only city which gets its winning numbers from daily race results

of various tracks, which are selected, in fact, by PETE LICAVOLI

and "RIP" KOURY.

Informant emphasized

that LICAVOLI has handled

the "green sheet" deal and the

• "service" for almost twenty-five

years in the numbers in Detroit and that LICAVOLI has employed

"RIP" KOURY, whom Informant refers to as "The Old Man"

, as the

"general superintendent" of both of these lucrative operations.

Informant stated that the "dago numbers houses" ceased

activity in the numbers on Friday, October 25, 1963, however,

Detroit still received the winning numbers each day even though

the syndicate "went out of action". He stated further that such

numbers gambling is operated differently thrughout the country

and that he knows of no other city which has such a sophisticated

numbers operation as does Detroit.

Informant said that Toledo,

Ohio

uses the daily U.S. Treasury balance to select their winning

number; Cleveland uses stock exchange results; Chicago

polley "wheel"; and New York has; what he tarned "one in the

pocket", where

"you bet two numbers and you got four going for

you." Informant, in expanding his comments about the syndicate

to hear the story

around town that JOE "HOOKS" MIRABILE "took a beating" from MIKE

RUBINO recently. He stated that "JOE HOOKS" has been employed for

years in the numbers with RUBINO and that he has been stealing from

RUBING throughout

that time. He said that "JOE HOOKS" "knows the

rules of the game" and if he had a beating coming he will take it and

"keep his mouth shut" about it

Informant revealed that, on the

other hand, "JOE HOOKS" MIRABILE has a younger brother who is about

twenty-six years old and who is

called

"LITTLE HOOKS" MIRABILE.

He

claimed that "LITTLE HOOKS" is a "real vicious kid" and that he

hates the "syndicate Dagoes" and will go out on his own to "avenge"

his brother's beating if need be. He added that "LITTLE HOOKS"

MIRABILE usually hangs around the Field and Jefferson area.

Informant advised that about a year or so ago MITCHELL

RAHAAL saved "JOE HOOKs" from a beating.

He explained that TONY

GIACALONE and his brother, BILLY, were looking for "JOE HOOKS"

one day around the Field and Jefferson area to set him up for a

beating. He stated that they grabbed a little guy named "GAIDO",

who is a close friend of JOE CORRADO, and who the GIACALONES be-

leeved would know "JOE HOOK's" whereabouts. Informant advised that

location but that he telephoned MITCH RAHAAL instead and that

RAHAAL came over immediately, met TONY GIACALONE,

and talked him out

of carrying out his intentions upon "JOE HOOKS"

Informant advised that he has not seen "BIG TIME PETE"

AMORMINO around town in the last four or five months. He claimed

that AMORMINO is supposedly

"on the lam" from the FBI and is in

hiding out of town.

area very well and could be located there.
