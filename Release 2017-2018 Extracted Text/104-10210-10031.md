MEMORANDUM FOX THE KECO.D

SUBJECT:

AnatolC RE NOSENKO

1.

1 31 March and 1 and 2 April 1969, Anatole was

consuliod about the NOSENKO case as a fclloir-up to the late

January 1969 neetings. He gave reconmendations concerning

the procedures and topics to be covered during the begia-

ning phases of additional elicitation from NOSE KO which is

to bagiri scon.

?. To provide a basis for discussion certain papers

hat been propared for Anatole's revier. (See Accachment A

for list.) These papers were basically questionnaires about

some of the untesolved or questionable aspects of the

NOJeNRO caso vased iaigoly on the coniiri themes mmatole

had highlighted or 17 January 1960 when he corsented after

revicwing the October 1957-December 1968 interviers of

NOSENKO. (See transcripts KY 1, 2, 3

and 4.) Other papers

concerned topics related to the NOSENKO case, rsnoranda

NOSENXO had written, sunnaries and questionnaires prepared

fxon both collateral infornation and NOSENKO's information

and sunmaries and questionnaires prepared exclusively on

the basis of information obtained from NOSENKO during the

1967-68 interview period. Each of these papers was read by

Anatole. Anatole's comment, our discussion, or any comment

is detailed in Attachment B, which sets forth crucial ques-

tions in the NOSENKO case.

3. Anatole was told The Director had decided that the

question of NOSENKO's bona fides had not been resolved and

had directed that additional elicitation and questioning of

NOSENKO would be undertaken immediately and expeditiously

pursued. It was understood, of course, as Anatole knew,

that he was to make a major contribution to the questioning

Of NOSENKO and that information to this end would be made

available to him: there will be the closest coordination

with him, including a timely review of ruture transcripts

based on the new elicitation phase.

It was understood his

views, comments and recommendations will be transmitted and

seriously considered if not explicitly implemented. Anatole

emphasized the need for him to review in advance all topics,

if not in all cases the specific questions, to be discussed

with NOSENKO after the new elicitation phase begins. He

understands the new elicitation

phase will begin with Attach

ment C and that there will be no additional topics discussed

with NOSENKO until after Anatole has an opportunity to

revich them and comment.

4. The following summary points energed during the

course of our discussions as things which nust be considered

in the NOSENKO case information and as papers of question-

naires are outlined and topics selected for further elicita-

tion from NOSENKO:

a. NOSENKO, as I understand the situation, has

had full access to newspapers, magazines, radio and TV since

approximately August 1968. Anatole was told I have no

knowledge of the periodicals or cooks he has read.

b. NOSENKO has recently been afforded a controlled

break from isolation and an opportunity to have feminine

companionship.

C. Since December 1968 the FBI has been inter-

viewing NOSENKO about topics previously discussed as well as

other matters of interest

to the FBI which do not originate

with NOSENKO. Anatole noted that FBI access to NOSENKO must

be controlled according to the new elicitation procedures.

d. That it is my opinion only that NOSENKO may

think he is entering into or close to entering into a new

relationship with the Agency on the basis that he has

satisfactorily answered all questions during the period

1967-68.

e. That it has not been possible and it may never

be possible to isolate or pinpoint either the exact informa-

tion or the point in time when NOSENKO was given new infor-

nation or additional information which might be relevant

upon analysis to the question of his bona fidos or his nission.

f. To date there has been a concentintion on pre-

paring elicitation questions on the basis of information

obtained during 1967-68 period because (a) this is the infor-

mation Aratole has reviewed, and (b) this information.has been

considered to be the standard for assessing NOSENKO and his

infornation and arriving at conclusions, since these inter-

views were designed to clicit information which would help

resolve discrepancies apparent in his previous statements,

and (c) at this time this information is better organized

and in contrast to information from 1962, 1964, etc., is

retrievable as an accurate or literal NOSENKO statement.

g. That the summaries and questionnaires, prepared

to date may not include every conment or statement NOSENKO

has made during the 1967-68 period because it has not yet

been possible to isolate, by indexing and extraction, every

reference to a person or a topic. Anatole was told that

the sorting or isolation process has been completed only

throuh Memorandum N-188, from

a total of approximately 260

memoranda.

It was emphasized that most topics and persons

were discussed with NOSENKO several times

at varying intervals,

and that the majority of topics were not covered to completion

in one or two interviews. NOSENXO also wrote memoranda on

topics which may not have been covered during interview or

which may relate to interview topics but which have not yet

been correlated with the interviews.

h. That research

and analysis on most topics is

incomplete, both with respect to collateral information and

previous statements from NOSENKO.

1. That, as Anatole knows, there is certain collateral

or related information such as information fron the FBI COn-

cerning NOSENKO which has not been made available to him.

Anatole realizes this type of information may be vital to any

consideration of the NOSENKO case and he also points out the

possible if not probable relationship between FBI infornation

and sources and the problem of penetration of American intel-

ligence and Soviet disinformation. He hopes the FBI will

agree to release pertinent information to him and discuss

sources in the ncar future. He realizes any analysis of

assessment of the NOSENKO case will suffer to the extent

infornation is withheld from him. Anatole understands the

problen even though he obviously does not accept it as

logical or helpful. He stresses the need for us to press

the FBI to make appropriate information available to hin.

j.

That infornation we are dealing with in the

transcripts of the 1967-68 NOSENKO interviews is not neces-

sarily information previously known to or discussed with

NOSENKO and that, for instance, the body of informatica ro-

sulting from the 1967-68 information has been expanded con-

siderably by NOSENKO's review of hundreds of names and

photographs provided hin. It was also noted that it has not

yet been possible to isolate topics new to NOSENKO about

which he was asked to comment during this period. Neither

nave we been able to isolate or determine when in the past

new, topics or questions of possible significance were intro-

duced to NOSENKO.

4. We discussed in detail Anatole's recommendations

and evolved an initial selection of Crucial Questions (Attach-

ment B) and from these the first topics and/or questions to

begin in the new elicitation phase with NOSENKO (Attachment C).

## Page 7

- 7 .

Anatole expects to review

and comnent and to frame additional

questions after he reviews the transcripts of the first

elicitations. He has requested and expecis, as this can be

accomplished, to review and comment about a summary of each

Crucial Question.. The summary is to set forth both collateral

and NOSENKO information and detail, with attachments if neces-

sary, exactly what NOSENKO has said. Also, pertinent photo-

graphs and appropriate other documentation is to be attached

for comment or verification of identity by Anatole. Anatola

insists that he review and assist in the framing of all ques-

tions to be assed of NOSENKO and he states that he will

stipulate the order of questioning by both topic and specific

question where appropriate. He will specify or indicate areas

as set forth in Attachment C where questioning may proceed

without his detailed guidance but he expects to be consulted

about each topic. He pians to carefully tailor the elicitation

approach and, more importantly, to

set down detailed guidelines

to follow when the elicitation or questioning becomes more

direct and concerned with those

subjects considered, now or

later as zevised, Crucial Questions.

Anatole foresees a period

of relatively bland elicitation which will be followed by a

gradual sharpening of questions to the point where there will

be a confrontation or hostile interrogation. He also foresees

another polygraph exanination either before or after the

period of confrontation. The

method or approach to the

elicitation from NOSENKO is elaborated in Attachment C.

Anatole's recommendations about confrontation tactics will

follow after the results of the elicitation phase have been

analyzed. During the period NOSENKO is being asked to con-

ment initially, work on additional elicitation topics will

continue.

5. Anatole continues to express his concern about the

problem of an Agency penetration and his absolute belief

that there is a continuing need to strictly compartment as

many aspects of our research as possible and to restrict

knowledge about our continuing efforts and particularly the

details to get to the bottom of the NOSENKO case. He

emphasizes the need to severely limit dissemination of the

results of the elicitation from NOSENKO although he under-

stands it will be necessary to provide the results to the

FBI. He is concerned

about the dissemination of his KY tapes

and the possible implications since he now believes he may

have erred in outlining too many areas of concern in the

context of considering NOSENKO's bona fides. Anatole was

told the KY tapes have not yet been made available to the

FBI but that, of course, he would be advised about any

proposal or decision

to disseminate then.

6.

In relation

to the point about Anatole's concern

about knowledge of his infornation I told Anatole that it

would be necessary for him to comment in detail in the

future as he had recently on certain items. He was told

that, as he knew, we are at a stage in the NOSENKO case

where details such

as the organizational assignments of

individuals and identifications and the number of leads

provided were tending to obscure the Crucial Questions

and divert our attention from the central problem oi why

NOSENKO would have been dispatched. I told Anatole quite

frankly there was a feeling he had not been fully cooperative

on the NOSENKO case. There was a belief that he should

furnish

the details of his knowledge about individuals,

operations, the KGB, etc., so that others can try to judge

the accuracy or inaccuracy of NOSENKO's information.

Anatole was told that it would come as no surprise, to him to

learn that the fact he has not told everything he knows is

still a problem and that there nay be some misunderstandings

since it is obvious his detailed knowledge has had and will

have a direct bearing on the NOSENKO case. Anatole firaly

but amicably reaffirmed his position concerning cooperation

on the NOSENKO case. He said (a) it was obvious that

research to dace and collateral information supports his

position that NOSENKO is 3 dispatched agent; (b) that he

will continue to cooperate fully as he has when there has

been an exchange of information; (c) that he would not give

details now because to do so would result in a situation

where it is "Anatole against NOSENKO" and it is obvious that

more evidence than this is required for an objective conclusion

about NOSENKO; (d) that details will follow after research is

analyzed or during the process of analysis as we examine

infornation and the details are pertinent; (e) that it is

unnecessary for him at

this time to give additional details

atcut personnel or the KGB organization except when these

details reflect on major items -- overall these details are

not crucial and there is nothing to gain by considering snall

items and details. If, however, snall details become a major

point such as in connection with KOVSHUK, CHURANOV, GUK

GRAZNoV' then during the review he will pinpoint the specific

and detailed contradictions. He reiterated his previous com-

ments pointed to the waste of time and diversion involved in

pursuing details and leads to recruitments or persons of

interest to the KGB when there is nothing crucial or significant

involved.

A. ANATOLE was consulted 31 March and 1 and 2 April 1969

concerning his roconnendations on hor to proceed to clicit

information Iron NOSENKO. ANATOLE offered specific.

topics and questions about which NOSENSO is to be questioned

after setting forth itens or topics which ANATOLE considers

the CRUCIAL QUESTIONS which need explanation or resolution.

Theso CRUCIAL QUESTIOYS arc set forth below with connent or

B. ANATOLE understands that the immediate period of

clicitation from NOSENKO is part of the program to attempt to

resolva the bona fides of NOSENKO. Ile understands that his

participation and contribution is actually the implementation

of the program he originally believed was to be followed

before there were any conclusions about NOSENKO's bona fides.

ANATOLE had been reviewing his file matorial and the transcripts

of his conments in January 1959 (The KY transcripts) so he

was prepared to discuss aspects of the CRUCIAL QUESTIONS as

well as spacific cicitation topics. As our contribution to

the discussion with ANATOLE we had prepared 26 papors relating

specifically to NOSENKO and I had notes concerning other points

or topics to be discussed. Each paper was read by ANATolE, he

4. A hostilo/confzontation interrogation phase at

which time NOSEYXO would be faced with the errors, incon-

sistencios, falsehoods, otc. in his story and advised that

his nission failed. This phase of the approach to NOSENKO

would only bo undertaken upon conclusion of tie clicitation

phase or if or when NOSENKO's attitude changes during the

elicization phase. The confrontation would be undertaken

only when full research on overy aspect of each CRUCIAL

QUESTION has been completed and specific questions are

framed wich ANATOLE on the basis of MOSENKO's information or

answers and all collateral infornation. In this connection

ANATOLE expects continuing rosearch on each crucial question

so that each can be examined on the basis of a sunnary of all

infornation about the question, the dotails of what NOSENKO

has said and rolated or collateral information such as

photographs or documents, etc. The hostile interrogation phase

ANATOLE anticipates will be undertaken ouly after full consid-

eration of all possible problems. For examplo ANATOLE stresses

he will need to review the Bagley letter of Novenber 1966 to "

HOSENKO since this will bo a key clocoit in considering how to

proceed with tho confrontation as sell as to attempt to determine

be possible to isolate or pinpoint either the exact inforna-

tion or the point in tine when NOSEYKO was given new infor-

nation or additional inforsation which night be relevant

upon analysis to the question of his bona fides or his mission.

f. To date there has been a concentration on pre-

I tOld LATOLE it was ny opinion

rocommendations that other interviors would stop. te

recognized and agreed that thera night be a tactical and/or

psychological problon with NOSEVO by shifting tho interviow

The tactic will be to insist on

respecis the FBI need to protect its sources and understands

had been a nistake to raiso the subject of the KGB policy and

1959 icorganization with NOSLk0. He road the paper with

attachnents but deforred comment except to note that HOSENKO

had said vory little of significance. It sas at this time

that ANATOLi first notod it was a mistake to pernit NOSENKO

to write menoranda. ANATOLE obviously considers this aspect

of the HOSENKO case most important and a topic which requires

his study particularly in view of the fact ho now has extracts

from the GOLENIENSKI letters which relate to the 1959 KGB

reorganization and disinformation. ANATOLE also did not rocall

the book so it will be necessary to make cortain he has a

copy.)

6. Penetration of the Anerican Embassy Moscow

(ANATOLE considers this a most important topic which requires

additional study and elicitation lator after research will

pernit us to assess

NOSENKO's statonents

reiterates his concern that it is exactly and specifically

in this area that NOSENKO's reassurance of no KGB successes

is cost likely diversion. MATOLE expressed his concern that

be asied to reconstruct conplutoly in detail everything he

knows about the VASSALL case:

construct i complete chronology of cverything NOSEIKO

the questions or conments put to HOSENKO about VASSALl. An

analysis comparison of these two papors will follow.

ANATOLE stresses the need to confine the questioning to the

additional infornation about the case, its origins, etc.,

cither as we knew it or now know it from ANATOLE. There will

be sone tie-in to the elicitation about Vladinir Luovich ARTENOV

10. The 1960 period of HOSENKO's carcer.

This is to be an elicitation topic later aftor ve

have sunnarized what we can about NOSENKO's story of this

period. In reply to ANATOLE's question based on his review

of the paper HOSENKO Timetable and Associates I told ANATOLE

the researcher had found it impossible to date to sort out

and Isolate NOSENKO's 1967-63 statenents about his career

during the period 1960 to 1962. ANATOLE was told this was

obviously a priority job but that it just had been an in-

possible task without additional research and analysis. We

" will discuss this fully when the isolation is completed and

in conjunction with other topics.

11. Vadin Viktorovich KOSOLAPOV 's lovenber 1960 trie.

This item is for later elicitation after nore

resoarch is completed about the code cleris, perhaps a reinves-

tigation to nake positive identifications, etc. ANATOLE asked

The Robert Lou JOuiSCH case.

MITOLE considers

this an inportant aspect

of

NOSE:KO's throw-away material. He again quostions way tho

SCD would lend technicians to the FCJ and wants HOSENKO to

explain chis in detail as woll as to fully dotail again hos,

fros so, etc. NOSErO learned of this casc. MiNTOLE is

of the opinion now questions can ho aslied but agreed to defer

clicitation on

this case

prinarily because I pointed out

that in 1965 a paper was written

setting forth apparont

inherent security weaknesses in the Johnson case some of mich

at least suggosted strongly that, in addition to Johnson's

lack of access at one tine, the kGB could have anticipated

a blow at any monent. I outlinod sone of the points I recall

about the weaknesses of the principals and quite frankly I

told NATOLE that I doubtod that anyone currently of the opinion

NOSENKO is bona fide would be any more inclined to crodit the

1965 paper today than he has in the past. I agroed that it

mighe be usoful to again attenpt to got NOSENKO's story about

the JOHNSON case when this story would be exclusively NOSENKO's.

13. Moksey Mikhaylovich GORBATENKO.

ANATOLE wants NOSENNO to tell in detail cverything

he linows about GORBATENKO. ANATOLE notes the 1955 pronotion is

a key elcent but stresses no contion of this is to be made

to NOSEINO. Despite previous sentions of GORBATENKO, which

should be collated, NOSENiO is io restate everything copletely.

15.. Vladislav Mikhaylovich KOVSHUK. ANATO!.:

considers NOSENKO's infornation about XOVSHUk nost important

as a lator clicitation point. He does not want NOSENKO asked

any questions about KOVSHUK which nay relate to KOVSHUK's

trip to the U.S.A. or KOVSHUK's association with KISLOV. If

NOSENKO in connection with detailing the biographios of his

friends includos any of this about KOVSHUk he is NOT to be

questioned on this natter or about the vonan troublo previously

mentioned.

ANATOLE needs exact datos KOVSHUK was in the u.S.

and any details of activities he can be given fron FBI reporting.

In connuction with our discussion about KOVSHUK possibly working

with and associating with journalists MiATOLE said he recalled

an incident which he thinks took place in 1959 whon

he net

KOVSHUK on the street not far from the KGB offices when KOVSUK

signalled him not to speak. ANATOLE did not and observed

KOVSulk meet a Soviet journalist in an apparent agent type secting.

16. Eugene Peter SEREBRENNIKOV.

MiNTOLE says that NOSENKO has said is clear

but that this needs full research and analysis - what he said

contrasted with what NOSENKO said and what SEREBRENNIKOV said -

before asking NOSENKO about this again.

17. Alaz BROCIES Case

ANATOLE was told this lead

infornation was boing

reviewed in detail. That there was some apparent confusion

and possibly misinterpretation or nisunderstanding about his

lead information.

ANATOLE reiterated his point that tho KGB wanted

to rcestablish relations which had been broken after BROCHES

left France. ANATOLE knows about this fron reading ZARUBIN

paper and he knows that the KGb wanted to talk to ZARUBIN

about this.

ANATOLE said that he would leave the decision

about when NOSENKO would be asked about BROCHES again to S: -

The CHENDPANCY Papers

MATOLE stressos the importanco of this case

but says this nust be a later topic for HOSENkO probably in

Intercogation although it say be useful to have NOSENKO

revion his knowlouge again in detail before confrontation.

ANATOLE referrod to tho neod to analyze

the results of the BONDEN investigation before proceeding too

far with HOSENKo.

In this connection ANATOLE was told State

Security was securcly organizing this investigation and that

• It was currently planned that interviews would commenco with

BONDEN first including nention to BOWDEN about his mention

in the CHEREPANOV papers. In response to ANATOLE's question

ho was told that to my knowledge the FbI did not yot know

about the BOWDEN investigation sinco to date it vas a State

Department inquiry based on a need to clarify certain possible

problens. ANATOLE said that he saw CHERGPANOV aftor CHEREPANOY

had transferred to the Anerican Embassy Section vearing a

Lt. Col, military uniform. ANATOLE said this vas unusual and

it suggests to him that CHEREPANOV was engaged in an operation,

perhaps a contact posing as a nilitary beginning in 1959.

Ho said CHBREPANOV had is a constant companion a young can in

the American Department but ANNTOLE cannot recall the young

Man's nans. CANATOLE suggests later lOSENKO be asked if

Homosacual Aspects but not on the basis of the ionosexual

angle (sce separate ciscussion re lionosexual aspects).

21. The TOPOV and PERKOVSKTY Cases

ANATOLE Jugs both of these cases should be delayed

until later, They require special considoration and more

rescarch and discussion. Ve are not ready now to delve into

those and it is his opinion he may have ichied to obscure sore

of the points about dOSENko by draving parallels with PeKO!S.IY

22. HOSENKO's Friendship with GUk: CHURISOV,_KOvSHuk._etc:

NATOLE emphasized the need to got fron lOSENKO complete

details about his friends or clained friends. AMATOLE agreed

with the line of inquiry outlined in the paper "Knowledge Because

of Association with other KGB Officers' and said elicitation

should include information

sufficient to give lis in one place

a, perspective on NOSENKD's associates and friends. This topic

can be covered immediately. ANATOLE stresses real importance

of ful, Kovshut and Churanov to NOSENKO. le notes Guk's wife

was the daughter of a minister and asks if NOSENKO could hare

the inclusion of a person such as NOSPiRO is very unusual. The

Foreign Minister and his aldes, etc., are trusted nen who go

- abroad regularly. These are always experienced KGB officers

on the operations in support of the delegations and the planning

is kell in advance. These officers can handle anything. At a

later date AlATOLE says ve can confront ROSFY sith this

that leading POSEYKO to a final alsolute written and docurented

provide additional psychological pressure useful in the final

NOSENKO's cooneration/ confession.

A. Elicit from NOSESKO statoments as detailed and

A'lATOLE considers this a topic worth more study and

which rolates to misinfornation about the American Embassy or

American personnel. We should

not consider this case closed and

more research is needed.

ATATOLE

pointed out the !. vic and only question with espect to OSEYXO

is misinfornation

and he sees no advantage or assistance

resulting fron question about GOLITZYM, Hoirever, he said this

was not his decision.

He was told the paper about the GOLITZYN

question

was prepared by a researcher who works exclusively

at this tine on the 1967-1968 naterials and the researcher

rosponded to a general requirement to extract information and

frane questions to be asked of NOSENKO which could be tosted

against known infornation. The researcher obviously believes

that if NOSENKO were to nake a false or nislcading statement

which GOLITZYN has of could deny or prove wrong NOSENKO would

be in a bind. ANATOLE was also told he must understand that

compartnentation in research and on NOSENKO as well as on

"larger issues neans that we will review a few papers which are

useless in the larger context eventhough to the researcher who

has a narrow view the concern is real.)

40. Gonnadly Ivanovich GRYAZNOV-

ANATOLE's rcaction to the questions and paper was that they

..will not accomplish nuch of significance re GRYAZNOV since he

thinks there is a GRYAZNOV relationship to the code clerk cases

which can only be determined after that research and analysis

of infornation about GRYAZNOV. He agreed the questions could

be used later during clicitation

as time fillers

and prelininary

to hard questions but not nuch will come because the questions

are not to the point, which he did not explain fully.

AYRTOLE did specifically challenge vocaiko's story of his

cinse relationship ith GPYAZIOV es a 110. ANNTOLE notes the

possibility thore as leaiage of his idontification to the FeI

and CIA Of GRYAZSOY

as a source. Particularly AATOLE says

HOSpiko's story of a close rolationship nich CRYAZiY in 1962

is probably false because there was to previous reintionship

Icading to this. ANATOLE said definitely that GrYAZSOV would

have been punished if the "GR knew he vas identificd as a source

to GOLITZY:.

AXATOLE says there Is a contradiction with MOSEND trying

to build up his relationship with GRYAZiOl and down-play or,

more accurately minimize, the extent of his relations vitr

CHURA"OV and GUK. ANATOLE believes it was a deliberate part

of BOSENKO's legend to set him close to CRYAZNGY since GRYAZNOV

was an ackrowledged source of some of roLlTyl's information.

The NOSENKO-GRYAZNOV relationship will be & key element in

future questioning:

A. "Comment on NOSEYKO Family Folations" was a paper in

• which ANATOLE found little of importance or significance as a

crucial point crcopt that as the discussions progressed he de-

veloped the idea that the 1945-50 period nay be crucial after

all. MATOLE sees little question about most of his life and

specificall ANATOLE says the homosexual question is not "in

line with avallable evidence". ANATOLE thought these questions

would rive vosENso the impressior we arr "unprofessional" but

innediatoly conceded this is renlly not a problen since NOSENXO

has not been handled very professionally in the past.

B. "NOSENKO - Homosexual Aspects"

ANATOLE questions any assunption that HOSENKO had any

"expertise" on hono

operations. He just does not think NOSENXO

was an "expert" or a

"specialist" and points out he can run

then at level he has described with very little knowledge.

ANATOLE Says he Knows NOSENKO was not a housexual before and

doubts ho would have been consulted ly anyone as a "specialist"

In view basic doubts if any question:

10 be used should be

woven into other topics and not trealed

as separate subject.

• 41. RUNYANTSEV

After reading the paper ANATOLE said there is nothing

to ask NOSENKO at this time. ANATOLE maintains this will be a

special question later. ANATOLE dircctly relates the RUMYANTSEV

case to what he considers was the serious nistake of asking

...NOSENKO about the May 1959 conforence. (See N-223) lle also

thinks further questions on the conference should only cone

later. ANATOLE saw clearly why no questions should have been

asked about RUNYANTSEV and May 59 Conference but after mistake

made it nay be we will want to adjust and consider what we might

gain by some questions during elicitation

or if touching on this

SECRET

## Page 58

point will upset the phasing of questions to NOSENKO. This

matter will be discussed further after iNATOLE reads the papers

carefully. AYATOLE was told it will be clear to him that the

May 59 meeting was known through GOLIENE/SKI and there was

some indication from this source also of wide scale nisinfor-

nation programs. It was also noted that in my opinion the

questions for NOSENKO, even with hindsight and my knowledge of -

how scriously GOLITZYN's inforation about this conference has

been vieved, were nornal intelligence officer questions which

NOSENKO could expect based on the overt infornation made available.

Certainly the questions were not unusual except for the fact

that they indeed were different fron other questions asked of

NOSENKO because they zouched on political natters. To the extent

that 11-228 showed NOSENKO someone at a lato dato was interested

in political natters NOSENKO nay have been alerted. Certainly it

would seen those questions were completely out of context :

out of the blue so to speak - and since there was no follow-up

NOSENKO way feel there is no real intcrest because there has

"been no real interest in natters political with hin.

A. "NOSENKO - Uso of Alias by KGB Officers"

ANATOLE connented these were very good questions. They

could be asked during elicitation or later during the crucial

or hard questioning phase when we were assured of fast follow-up

questioning.

B. "JOSENKO - Knowledge because of Association with other

KBS Officers".

ANATOLE thought this was excellent approach. He

comentod in connection with paras 9 and 1l and using this paper

stressed need to elicit all possiblo from OSENKO orally during

intervier and no written nenorandun. NATOLE outlined need for

NOSENKO to list exact dates of all his service assignments;

when he first met each officer; detailed biography of each

officer, etc. He retained without conment the 28 March 1969

addendus to RAOUSKIY, SUTYREV, and SUROV.

42. Nikolay S. SKVORTSOV and Vladinir Vasilyevich KRIVOSHEY

NATOLE, as with these officers, separately lists KGB

officors of special significance as pait of the enumeration of

CRUCIAL QUESTIONS because they are not only prominent in

*OSENKO's story but also of major concern to us since they work

ngainst Anericans. They are important even without NOSENKO.

In most instances also there will be the initial new elicitation

about them from NOSENKO. Then NOSENKO's previous information

will be collated and compared with collateral infornation,

including previous information fron GOLITZYN, after which ANATOLE

will review, conment with now information, if any, and frame

pertinent questions for NOSENKO. Specifically ANATOLE says

that NOSENKO's statement he consulted SKVORTSOV about tourist

operations 1955-59 is nonsense. SAVORISOV was in Gernany until

1959. NOSENKO should be asked what kind of tourist operations,

etc.

45. NOSENKO-ASen GEORGIEV Case

ANATOLE believes these questions useful now in

elicitation phase. He wants to review everything NOSENKO has

said about Anatoliy S. KOZLOV and view any photos. I could

nọt confirm that KOZLOV had participated in the Catcase.

ANATOLE asks if we can confirn KO%LOV was Chief of the American

Section when NOSENKU left the Section in 1955 and what NOSENKO

said about early relations including precise dates when NOSENKO

says KOZLOV was his boss. In this connection it is noted that

NOSENKO says KOZLOV was Chief of Dept I (Page l of paper) then

Deputy Chief of Dept 7 (page 4). ANATOLE says as clicitation

question NOSENKO should be asked why the demotion and also what

happened to GORBATENKO.

Not unexpectedly, MATOLE said he would eventually

want to

see tha file on the GEORGIEV case to

see what the

but he also makes the point he considers the ‹

caSe

important separately from considerations of NOSENO. He recalled

Mr. O'NEAL was to review the file with him and arrange interview

,of s

abut he has heard nothing. On the basis of short

-discussion ANATOLE believes there aro unexplored aspects to this

case and parallels with the RUNYANTSEV case as far

as NOSENKO

is concorned which may go to penetration in the N'1 ENB, MoscoN

or even to Germany. The tining is important.

review all verified info against NOSENKO's statenents. For

example was his diplonatic passport verified, etc.

C. ANATOLE would like to review the lists of other nembers

of the delegations of which he was a nember as well as the

lists of other delegations there at the sane time.

(S31 NOTE: Check N-127, page 7 - he could take orders of

questions about why and how he becane a lt. Col. ANATOLE

a very few persons knowledgable. (S!! NOTE: Check all Ieports.)

ANATOLE suggests this question for polygraph: "Did the

travel document you brought reflect your true rank on the basis

of your success and achievements of your game with AIS which

began in June 196z in Geneva?

In this connection also ANATOLE points to two promotions

in one year (1962) (See N-181 pg 27): Chief of Section then

•Deputy Chiof of Department. How has NOSENKO explained this

when he was not in his first job even three months and he had

no major successes in Geneva

- What

"; wore the cases he handled and the recruitments he nade in 1962?

53. American Ambassadors

ANATOLE believes at a later date NOSENKO should bo

asked or confronted about operations against American Ambassadors.

However, as an olicitation question ANITOLE thinks he

should be asked if he knew of any Anerican Anbassador who was

recruited at any time by SCD?

Later, under the hostile interrogation he would be

asked if he knew about an important high level SCD American

agent who was recontacted and reactivated when he visited Moscow

in 1959. Other questions to follow fron the tean of interrogators

such as who did of would have handled this agent, etc.

FBI took. If there is sonething pertinent to NOSENKO wo can

considor for later use.

55. Yuriy Vasilyevich KROTKOV

ANATOLE says we should extract and review what

NOSENKO has said about KROTKOV and line out the parallels

in the info. ANATOLE notes KROTKOV - Oct 1963; Chorepanov -

Nov 1963 and NOSENKO - Jan 1964, and he thinks we need to frame

questions to includo KROTKOV in our considerations. He recalls

KROTKOV promised an expose of the KGB and this never camee

KOVSHUK was, of course, named

not stating a fact but making a supposition.

It is not clear, in fact, whether GOLITSYN

knows or supposes that this caused NOSENKO's

transfer out of Il/1 into 11/7.

The post of Assistant Section Chief -- which

GOLITSYN says NOSEto clained to occupy

in 1960-62 -

was abolished
