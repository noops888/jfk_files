FROM

SUBJECT

"Oswald Reportedly Told Cubans of Plan

to Kill JFK"' by John M. Goshko, Washington

Post, 13 November 1976.

The memorandun"..:by the late FBI Director

J. Edgar Hoover saying that Lee Harvey Oswald reportedly

told Cuban officials in advance of President Kennedy's

assassination that he intended to kill the President':

is cited in Commission Exhibit No. 3152, Volume XXVI,

of the Hearings Before the President's Commission on the

Assassination of President Kennedy pp. 154-157 (See Tab A)

CE No. 3152 is cited in support of statements made by the

Warren Commission in it's Report on pages 307-308 (see

Tab B). This memorandun is based upon information which

the Agency had passed to FBI Headquarters and it's repre-

On 26 November 1963, the Mexico City Station

came to the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City.

He claimed he

had been in the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City on 18

September 1963 when a man he later recognized to be Lee

Harvey Oswald received $6, 500 in cash to kill an important

person in the United States:

A short dissemination (DIR 85744) alerting custons agencies

to the White House, the Federal Bureau of Investigation,

The min can do te

was made on 29 Novenber 1963

and the Department

of State (see Tab D). A second dis-

semination (DIR 87657) was made on 7 December 1963 (see

Tab E) .

(NB:

In the latter dissemination, mention was

made that a representative of the FBI participated in the :

interrogation of ALVARADO.)

4.

On 13 December 1963,

the Agency forvarded under

CSCI 3/779,

136 a translation of the Mexican police

interrogation report on Gilbarto ALVARADO Ugarte. (see

Tab F).

In summary, the Agency and the FBI knew of

ALVARADO's allegations concerning Oswald, which were sub-

sequently retracted by ALVARADO himself

as being false.

In addition,

the FBI was able to prove that Oswald was

still in New Orleans at the time ALVARADQ claimed he saw:

Oswald in the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City.

The information

was forwarded to the Warren Commission by the Agency and the

FBI as evidenced by its inclusion in the Warren Commission

Report and accompanying exhibits.

Mexico City in early Septembar to receive money and orders for the

assassination, ss thrit he hnd been flown to a secret airfeld somewhere in

or ness the lucitan Peninsula, es that he might hava made contadis u

Mexico City with a Communist from the United States shortly

before the assassination, and that Oswald asonssinated the Presi-

dent at the direction of a particular Cuban ageat who met with him in

the United States and paid him $7,000.70 A letter was received from

someone in Caba alleging the irriter had attended a-meeting where

the assassination had been discussed as part of a plan which would

soon include the death of other non-Communist leaders in the Ameri

cas. in The charge was made in a Cuban espatriate publication that in

a speech ha delivered 5 days after the assassination, while he wis under

the infuence of liquor, Fidel Castro made a slip of the tongue and sara,

"The first time Ostrald was in Cubs" thereby giving arsy the

fact that Osvald had made one or more surreptitious trips to that

Some stories linked the assassination to anti-Castro groups tho

allegedly were engaged in obtaining licit fraarms in the United

States, ons such claim being tbat these groups lailed the President as

part of a bargain with some illicit organizations who would then

supply them with frearms as paymenton Other rumors placed

Ostrald in Minmi, Fla, at various times, allegedly in pro-Cuban ac

• tivities thare.? The assassination was chimed to hate been carried

out by Chinese Commonists operating jointly with the Cubans 33

Oswald as also alleged to hare met with the Ciban ambassador in

aDlaxico City restaurmt and to lave driven off in the Ambassador's

ar for a private tale*". Castro hirself, it was alleged, 2 days after

the assasaination called for the files relating to Ostrald's dealings with

to members of the Cuban diplomatic mission in the Soviet Union;

the inference drain was that the "dealings" and occurred and had

established a secret subversive relationship which continued througi

Oswald's life. Without exception, the rumors and allegations of

a conspiratorial contact era shor to be mithout any factual basis,

in some cases the product of mistaken identification.

Mastrative of the attention given to the most serious allegations

is tha case of "D" & joung Latin American secret ugent who ap.

proached T.S, authorities in Mexico shortly aiter the assassination

and declared that he saw Lee Harvey Oswald receiving S8,500 to kill

tha President. Among other details, "D" said that at about noon on

September 18, waiting to conduct some business nt the Cuban con-

salate, he say a group of three persons conversing in a patzo a few

feet arry. One tras a tall, thin Negro with reddish hair, obviously

-dyed, who spoke rapidly in both Spanish and English, and another

ras a men he said tas Lee Harvey Oswald. A tall Cuban joined the

group momentarily and passed some currency to thia Negro. The

Negro then allegedly said to Ostrald in English, "I mant to fill the

man." Ostrald replied; "You're not man enough, I can do it." The

Negro then said in Spanish; "I cin't go with you, I have a lot to do."

Ostrald replied, "The people are waiting for me bick there." The

Negro then gave Oswald $6,500 in large denomination American bill:

saying, "This isn't much." After hearing this conversation, "D" said

that he telophoned the American Embassy in Mexico City sereral

times prior to the assassination in an attempt to report his belief that

someone important in the United States was to be billed, but tas

finally told by someons at the Embassy to stop wasting his time.

"D" and his allegations were immediately subjected to intensive

investigation. His former employment as an agent for a Latin Amari-

can country tag confirmed, although his superiors had no kinowledge

of his presence in Blesico or the assignment described by "D." Four

days after "D" first uppeared the US. Government was informed by

tha Mexican authorities that "D" had admitted in writing that his

mhole narrative about Oswald vas false. He said that he had never

seen Oswald anyplace, and that he had not seen anybody paid monar.

in the Cuban Embassy. He also admitted thet he never tried to tale

phons the American Embassy in Saptember and that his first call to

the Embassy was after the asgassination "ID" said that his motire in

fabricating tha story was to halp get himsalf admitted into the United

States so that he could there participate in action against Fidel Castro

He said that he hated Castro and hoped that the story he made u

would be biliaved and would cause the United States to "take action"

against him.

Sail later, when questioned by American anthorities, "D" claime

hat he had been pressured into retracting his statement by the Mes

ican police and that the retraction, rather than his first statement

ras false A partion of the American questioning was carried or

with the use of a polygraph machine, with the consent of "D." When

told tat the machine indicated that he was probably lying, "D! said

words to the effect that he "must be mistaken." Investigation in the

meantime had disclosed tast the Embassy extansion namber "D" said

he had called wonid not have given him the person he said he spole

to, and that no ons at the Embassy-clerks, secretaries, or officers

had any recollection of his calls. In addition, Oswald spoka little, if

any, Spanish. That he could have carried on the alleged conversation

with the red-headed Negro in the Cuban Embassy, part of which was

supposed to have been in Spanish, as therefora doubtfal. "D" noT

said that he was uncertain as to the date when he sai "sorteone tho

looked lisa Oswald" at the Cuoan Embassy, and upon reconsideration,

he nosy thougat it was on s Tuesday, September 17; rather than Sep

tember 18.. On September 17, however, Oswald visited the Louisinat "!

Stata Unemployment Commission in New Orleans nad also cashed a

coec's from the Tezas Employment Commission at the Winn-Disie

Store No. 1425 in Naw Orleans

. On the basis of the retractions made

by "D" when he heard the results of the polygraph examination, and

on the basis of discrepancies which appeared in his story, it mis

concluded that "D" was dying a

The investigation of the Commission has thus produced no evidence

that Oswald's trip to Mexico as in way way connected with the assas

siastion of President Kennedy, nor has it uncovered evidence that the
