ADMINISTRATIVE

Information copies are being sent to the offices

indicated inasmuch as they have conducted investigation in

this case in the past and in the future may have leads to

cover.

For over forty years subject has used the name

JOHN ROSSELLI.

In 1936 he filed a report of birth in Chicago,

Illinois, in the name of JOHN ROSELLI.

However, because he

has for many years spelled his name ROSSELLI this is the

spelling that will be used throughout this report, The

title will be continued as JOHN ROSELLI.

Intensive discreet investigation has been conducted

since the first part of 1964, when information was first

received that ROSSELLI's true name was FILIPPO SACCO

endeavoring to develop other facts to prove this identity.

A report was not submitted previously because no

Open investigation would

have in all probability compromised the original informant

and endangered his physical

well being or even his life.

This

condition still

exists and, therefore,

the source of this

information should be carefully guarded and under no circum-

stances be disseminated outside the Bureau.

LA 4448-CTE originally furnished the information

that ROSSELLI's true name is FILIPPO SACCO. He also furnished

information which lead to the identification of TANCREDI

mer cate

TORIORA, a former associate of ROSSELLI in Boston, Massachusetts,

and Los Angeles, California.

LA 4448-CTE also furnished considerable other infor-

mation concerning ROSSELLI's past life which furnished leads

in this investigation.

TANCREDI TORTORA was convicted in Boston, Massachusetts,

in 1934 for a murder he committed in Boston in 1922. He was in a

fugitive status from 1922 until 1934. In 1950 he was released

from prison and deported to Italy where he presently resides

in Acerra, Italy, which is located in the vicinity of Naples.

I TANCREDI TORTORA has been interviewed on several

occasions and has advised that he knows JOHN ROSSELLI's true

name is FILIPPO SACCO.

He first met FILIPPO SACCO in Boston,

Massachusetts; in the early 1920's and stated that FILIPPO

SACCO first started using the name JOHN ROSSELLI in about

ea usear the name g

1923 when TORTORA, ROSSELLI, and one PASQUALE CAPPIELLO were

employed as track

hands for

the Pere Marquette Railroad in

the Detroit, Michigan - Buffalo, New York, areas.

The files

of the Pere Marquette have been

checked, but no record was

found of the employment of any of these

three men.

TORTORA furnished considerable background information

concerning ROSSELLI's activities.

, Investigation conducted on

the basis of TORTORA's information as well as information

furnished by LA 4448-CTE developed no further individuals who

knew ROSSELLI'S true name was FILIPPO SACCO.

TORTORA has declined to be a witness in this matter

and has declined to furnish a deposition setting forth his

knowledge in this matter.

He has requested that the fact that

he has

furnished information be kept confidential.

In the details of this report every effort has been

made to conceal the identity of IA 4448-CTE and TANCREDI

TORTORA.

Some of the information furnished by them is known

only to them and to report it would disclose

the source and,

therefore, it has not been reported.

When information was received regarding ROSSELLI'S

true identity it was considered likely that if ROSSELLI was

confronted with this information he might be persuaded to

cooperate with the Bureau.

INFORMANTS

The informants mentioned in the first part of the

details of this report are LA 4448-CTE and TANCREDI TORTORA.

They were not mentioned by a T symbol in the details

identity.

only five

people know of his dual identity who might

have

furnished this information.
