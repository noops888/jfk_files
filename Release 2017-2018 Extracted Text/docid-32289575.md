TP 92-1

Cleveland Office has advised that numerous attempts.

to contact CARMEN MILANO have been unsuccessful and that it

appeared unlikely that any interview of MILANO relative to

the activities of TRAFFICANt would be productive, and that

unless advised to the contrary, MILANO was not being inter-

viewed..

Tampa, however, requested that additional efforts

to interview MILANO be afforded.

On June 1, 1967, Sgt. JACK DE LA LLANO, Intelligence'

Unit, Tampa Police Department, advised that he had received

information from the Dade County Intelligence Unit to the ef-

fect that the following additional telephone numbers have

been identified as being contained in the personal papers of

TRAFFICANTE, but was unable to state the (ircumstances sur

rounding the obtaining of these numbers, inciuding the date

obtained or the location where the telephone numbers had

- been located:

759-4882

665-1522;

448-6201;

665-1895
