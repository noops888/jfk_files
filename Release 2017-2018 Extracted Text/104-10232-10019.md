Dr. NIRD sald there was no way to detormind the accuracy

of the ligures alven of planes, guno, ate, roceived irom tos sovlot bloc

fand lialy and Canada) but even li.the figuros were exaggerated 100 por

He addod that Castro la dally bocoming atrongor militarily

with weapons and with a largo inilitia of close to 300, 000 being trained

" to uee them while the econuuy coutinues to detericrate. Perhaps only

half the miliela would be sfiective.

But that is alseable. Thus, he said,

the langer the delay in positive military action to overthrow Castro, Cha

greater will bo the task.

"We must act soon, viyorously and effectivaly,

to laburo victory. Anothes defeat would be disastrous and would make

Cubano, Letla Amoricauo and others bollove Castro to be Invincible.

Then would como accommodationa and even worse, the implanting of

Castro-backed ragines in the homisphere.

And the U. S. would suffer

woret of all, being discreditori los defeat and "guilt of intoriorenco."

"Ia tho UN no nation would stand beside the U. S."

Proposal that Council go to Cuba with Commando Group and

Establiah a Covorumnat on Cuban Sull

Dr. MIRO then doclared that he was convinced that Castro

wouid nevor be overthron by all the propaganda, the savotast, commando

ralda, guerrilla acilvities, rupture of diplomatic relations and deterioraling

aconony, and that it was inconcalvable to establial a government ir-exile

for nuthing would c: me of ll, that she ouly solution for defeating tha

Castro regimo was for the Revolutionary Council to go to Cuba and estab-

ilah a govornment en Cuban soll, aat rocognitlon by all iriendly countries

and military assistance of ita pricipal ally, the U. 5., and that the U. 3..

This would all have

to take place in a maltos of 48 houro, otherwice it would fall. I rocognise

that this do a bold plan, bur boldness is necessary. Thare will be many

clato, many may be killed. A for myoeif, l don'i care ll I die. I have

that all must be well propared in advance, there must de no vacillation,

everything must proceed rapiúly. Firat, a commando raid in force to

of courue hio plan would have to ba studied at the higheat government

levele. He proposed that he indçhe elaborate a pian with his military
