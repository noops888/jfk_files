SECRET NOFORN

Information received from various

independent sources in Cuba during

the past several days indicates the .

existence of an active conspiracy

which hopes to overthrow the Cuban

regime in the near future. The con-

spiracy is said to include the assassination of Prime Minister Fidel

Castro and his brother Raul, the revolt of a portion of the Cuban

Armed Forces, and a coordinated invasion of armed forces from the

Dominican Republic.

According to the report, the key factor in the current con-

spiracy is Major William Alexander Morgan, an American soldier

of fortune who fought against the Batista regime during the recent

revolution. Morgan has reportedly agreed to defect, taking with

him 4, 000 members of the Armed Forces, who are mainly former

members of the second national front of Esacambray. Further-

more, Morgan reportedly claimed that a number of officers of the

Cuban Army, including a few of major rank, are with him in the

conspiracy.

ACS/I Comment: While it is

possible that an attempt to overthrow the Castro government by

armed force will be tried soon, it seems almost certain that it would

fail. If Fidel Castro and his brother were assassinated, however,

an opposition group might successfully take power in the resultant

chaos. At the same time, an opportunity would be created for the

Communists to enhance their position.

Although Trujillo is known to be supporting Cuban irregulars

in the Dominican Republic and elsewhere, it is highly unlikely that

he would support a military adventure against Cuba prior to the

convening of the American Foreign Ministers in Chile on 12 August.

Meanwhile, the Castro

government continues to have the

ardent support of a considerable majority of the Cuban people.

Discontent has increased, but there is no evidence that it ex-

tends to actual participation or approval of conspiracies against

the regime.,
