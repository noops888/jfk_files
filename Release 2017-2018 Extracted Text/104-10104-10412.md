Subject suffered a nervous breakdown in March 1952 and was returned

to leadquarters, Washington for medical observation. Examination by the

Medical Office in April 1952 concluded that Subject's breakdown was caused

by family trouble and overindulgence in alcohol. The Nedical Office

o at test end se

period of one year, these duties to be performed within the continental

Subject was convinced no goverament agent was there, he stated he "had

served overseas with the CIA and had seen many people killed. The CIA
