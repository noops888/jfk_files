Informant stated that SANTO showed displeasure with the fact that

the informant is now only a "soldier" after having been a success-

ful "Capo" before going to prison.

SANTO did not seem to be

sympathetic toward California LCN leadership, especially the way

it was portrayed in the recent "Life" magazine article

ridiculed the San Jose Family. He suggested that the informant

attempt to regain his "Capo" status. SANTO indicated he was more

closely connected with the Chicago leadership than with the Detroit

leaders and that he generally liked the idea of one LCN Family

for all of California

with closer ties to Chicago.

SANTO questioned the informant about the "Life" magazine article

regarding the san Jose lamily.

The

informant told him it was all

true.

He told SANTO that at the time he was a close friend of LCN

"Capo" ANGELO MARINO Of San JOSe.

He described how ANGELO's

father, SALVATORE MARINO, had been a

that several years ago, the San Jose LON boss, JOE CERRITO,

wanted SAL to step down.

ago at costa Tod

"Capo" in the San Jose Family

SAl contacted the informant to get his

opinion and the informant advised him that since CERRITO felt that

way, he should

step down, but only on condition that his son,

ANGELO, take his place.

CERRITO agreed to this and this is how

ANGELO

became "Capo",

SANTO described ANGELO as a very weak man who could not kill any.

one if his own life depended on it and that he had no talent what-

ever for LCN racket activity;

that most of his adult life was

spent chasing women and gambling while his father had to run the

California Cheese Co.

The informant told SANTO that around 1963 or 1964 ANGELO came to

contact the informant and told him that he had received an

execution contract

sought advice.

The informant advised

that ANGELO wanted him

to help him but he told ANGELO he was

on parole and could have nothing

to do with it. He told ANGELO

a couple of trusted "soldiers" and carry out the contract.

Sometime later he heard that the intended victim was picked up

by INS for deportation and he always suspected. ANGELO, instead of

killing the intended victim, made an anonymous call to have him

picked up rather than kill him. He stated that from questioning

ANGELO at that time, he learned ANGELO had even talked to the

intended victim while the contract. was in force and he also learned

the contract had been given ANGELO by the LON San Jose boss, doE

CERRITO.
