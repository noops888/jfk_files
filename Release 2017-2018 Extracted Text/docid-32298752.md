interested in the same property.: Informant said that he

areas is in his judgment completely dominated by KELLY MANNARINO,

possession of KELLY MANNARINO.. Informant also pointed out that

GENEVIEVE MORENO IS SAM MANNARING's personal secretary and that

MANNARINO has been buying property in her name.
