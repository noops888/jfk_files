AT BRADENTON, FLORIDA

RUFO LOPEZ FRESQUET,

2118 - 12th Avenue West,

Bradenton,

Florida, advised SA RAYMOND N. BYERS or

May, 8, 1961 as follows:

He knew of SANTO TRAFFICANTE in Cuba and knew

he operated gambling casinos at Havana Hilton and Sans

Soucie.

He said he also knew that RAUL GONZALEZ worked

for TRAFFICANTE in the Hilton casino.

He said he was

not an associate of GONZALEZ Or TRAFFICANTE and knew

nothing of their business arrangements. He explained

that the only reason he approached GONZALEZ to arrange

for escape from Cuba to the United States was because

he was desperate and in fear of his life if he remained

in Cuba longer.

FRESQUET said he did not associate with

GONZALEZ in the Unitéd States nor does he know who

GONZALEZ associated with. He said he heard that

GONZALEZ opened a restaurant in Miami which soon

failed and GONZALEZ then joined the resistance movement

against CASTRO. He said GONZALEZ landed in Cuba during

the recent invasion and is now a prisoner

according to

the list of prisoners published in the U. S.

FRESQUET said he was never associated in the

same circles as the gamblers,

and he knows nothing of

their activities and/or associates.

He said he has no

idea where TRAFFICANTE is now located or what his

financial condition might be.

Nor does he know how

TRAFFICANTE enteredthe United States.

He pointed out

that the people working for the overthrow of CASTRO

do not associate with the gamblers, and he is not in a

position to obtain

any information concerning TRAFFICANTE.
