FOREIGN INFLUENCES IN THE

BLACK NATIONALIST MOVEMENT

D:2/19/841

Although evidence to date is lacking which would

show the black nationalist movement in this country is either

under foreign control or direction, it must be recognized that

a real potential for foreign exploitation exists and presents

a definite threat to our internal security. In fact, as

evidenced by the following, considerable data has already been

developed indicating varying degrees of foreign participation,

influence and/or involvement among black/nationalist groups

and individual militants.

Organization of Afro-American Unity

Malcolm X Little was an articulate member of the

Nation of Islam, a black nationalist organization headquartered

in Chicago, Illinois, until his expulsion in late 1963. While

with the Nation of Islam his violently antiwhite utterances

brought him widespread notoriety,

In 1964, Malcolm X, as he was known, with the assist-

ance of a United Arab Republic advisor at the United Nations

made a trip to Mecca. In the course of this trip and subsequant

ones in 1954, he visited such countries as Nigeria, Chana, Morocco,

Algeria, Tanzania, Guinea, Kenya, and Uganda whare he was fre-

quently

raceived as a guest by the heads of state. In Ghana he

was received by the Cuban and Communist-Chinese Ambassadors.

In June, 1964, he arnounced the formation in New York:

intended to include all people of African descent in the Western.

Hemisphere, as well as "our" brothers and sisters on the African

continent.

The initial aim of this organization was to intes-

nationalize the American civil rights movement by taking it to

the United Nations.

Malcolm X was murdered in February, 1965, and his

organization for all intents and purposes has ceased to function

effectively.

Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee

Stokely Carmichael, former Chairman of the Student

Nonviolent Coordinating Conmittee (SNCC), was a great admirer

of Malcolm X and his teachings have undoubtedly influenced

Carmichael and other leaders of this organization into moving

the SNCC into the militant black nationalist organization that

it is today. The SNCC is now motivated by a revolutionary

direct-action, antiwhite ideology that places no faith in

normal denocratic procedures. It follows the Communist Party

* line in its criticism of United States policy in Vietnam and

in its recent charge that Israel was guilty of aggression in

the Middle East.

The actual as well as the potential extent of foreign

involvement and participation in the black nationalist movement

is highlighted by the recent foreign travels of Carmichael and

other members of SNCC. Carmichael, George Ware, Julius Bernard •

Lester, and Elizabeth Sutherland, also members of SNCC, traveled

to Cuba in July of 1967. Carmichael

as a guest of the Cuban

Government and an "honorary delegate" attended the conference

of the Latin American Solidarity Organization (LASO) held in

Cuba in July and early August, 1967; where he sought to tie.

basic theme of the conference.

He expressed support for a

policy of armed struggle declaring that violence is the only

method of struggle. He stated that it was necessary to "create

50 Vietnams" in the United States "in the same way as outside

of the United States."

At ceremonies in Santiago de Cuba,. Fidel Castro intro-

duced Carmichael as "one of the most distinguished leaders for

civil rights in the United States." In a press conference in

Havana on August 1, 1967, Carmichael praised Cuban comnunism,

called Abraham Lincoln a "white racist" and listed his idols

as the late Malcolm X, Cuban guerrilla warfare expert Ernesto

"Che" Guevara, and Chinese communist leader MAD Ise-tung.

Carmichael is reported to have stated in Cuba, "We have to fight

in the United States in order to change the.

structure of that

capitalist society." He called his talks with Fidel Castro as

"the most educational, the most interesting, and the best

apprenticeship of my public life." He was successful in

getting Castro's promise to take up the cudgel for the American

Negro. .

On his way to Cuba, Carmichael visited England in

July, 1967, where his contacts included Ralph Schoenman,

Director of the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation, which is

sponsoring the Vietnam War Crimes Tribunal, Michael De Freitas,

a self-styled leader of an alleged black muslim movement in the

United Kingdom, and allegedly some leaders of the African

National Congress,

a comnunist-infiltrated group. While in

England, Carmichael made a violently antiwhite speech in which

he advocated the internationalization of the colored peoples'

struggle, including a policy of violence and guerrilla warfare.

From Cuba Carmichael traveled extensively abroad

seeking support for his movement in the United States. He

visited. Hanoi, North Vietnam, where he was received by North

Vietnamese Government officials. His other travels included

visits to Algeria, Guinea, Syria, Egypt, Tanzania, Denmark,

and Sweden. He attended portions of the second session of

the Vietnam War Crimes Tribunal in Copenhagen, Denmark, in

late Novenber, 1967, as the SNCC representative on this

tribunal.

Carmichael arrived in Paris, France, from Stockholm,

Sweden, on the evening of December 5, 1967, and was initially

refused permission to enter; horever, friends of Carmichael who

had been involved in the War Crimes Tribunal, including Jean-

Paul Sartra, a well-known French communist, applied a great

deal of pressure on the French Government to admit him. As a

result, he was admitted for a period not to exceed 90 days.

• Interestingly, most of the known contacts of Carmichael while

in Paris were communists and others of that ilk active in

opposition to the United States war effort in Vietnam.. In

speaking at a meeting organized by the National Vietnam Comnittee,

which opposes United States involvement in Vietnam, he stated,.

"We do not wish to see peace in Vietnam but victory by the

Vietnamese over the United States. The moment has come for we

black Americans to move from protestation to resistance; it is

now that we must fight in order to avoid becoming a nation of

assassins. If necessary we will plunge the entire United States

into chaos." Carmichael returned to the United States on

December 12, 1967.

It is interesting to note that Carmichael's travels

abroad in some instances paralleled the travels of Malcolm X

in 1964.

In an interview in Tanzania in

November, 1967, Carmichael

stated that Cuban Embassies had been most helpful to "us" wherevar

"we've gone." He further stated that "lots" of success had bean

obtained as

a result of "our" trip on the coordination of black .

captioned "To Hell

With Protest" appearing in a recent SNCC

newsletter which contains a vicious attack on the President of

the United States and veiled threats to his safety.

Numerous other members of SNCC have traveled abroad

during the year, 1967, seaking support for their movement.

They have reached sich

1 far-flung countries as Cuba, England,

France, Sweden, Norway, Cambodia, North Vietnam, Tanzania,

Czechoslovakia, and Russia. John Tillman represented SNOC

at an anti-Vietnan conference held in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia,

in September, 1957, which was attended by representatives of North

Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

Fiva members of SNCC traveled to Havana, Cuba, 07

January 1, 1958, reportedly to attend a "cultural" conference

in Havana scheduled for January 4 - 11, 1968. This matter was

handled through the Cuban Mission to the United Nations.

Although billed as a cultural congress to include

writers, artists, 'and scientists from all over the world, the

general

theme of the conferance will be colonialisn and neo-

Indications are quite clear that SNCC is attempting

to obtain international recognition. It has appointed a

Director of International Relations, James Forman, who is

stationed in New York City, and has attempted to establish an

international headquarters at Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Tanzania

would appear to be ideal for such a headquarters baçause of

that country's pro-comnunist orientation, the heavy influx of

•Comnunist Chinese technicians and scientists, and the large

Communist Chinese Embassy located there. Further, Carmichael

in his public utterances abroad has called for international-

ization of the black power movement.

The development of international contacts by SNCC

could have begun as early as 1964 when some members of the

organization visited Guinea at the invitation of its President,

Sekou Toure., SNCC representatives participated in a national

youth seminar on racialism held in Tanzania in April, 1966.

James Forman participated in a United Nations Seminar on

Apartheid, Racial Discrimination and Colonialism

in Southern

Africa which was held in Zambia in July, 1967, in wnich a wide

variety of Governmental representatives

including some from

the USSR and other Soviet-bloc countries participated. Fay

Bellany, Vernon Crutchfield, Dwight Williams, and Muriel

Tillinghast, SNCC representatives, visited the Soviet Union

in June, 1966, at the invitation of the Soviet Committee of

Youth Organizations and at the suggestion of the Communist

Party, USA. The Soviet Union paid all the expenses of this

travel. William Hall, a SNCC representative, attended the

September of that year he was in touch with the Chinesa

in July of 1966 where he claims to have sat in on a

cabinet meeting of the Guban Government. Thomas has also

stated that a civil rights leader is obligated to enlist

support from any source willing to offer it including

the so-called communists. Thomas was introduced by

Stokely Carmichael at a meeting in Chicago, in May, 1967,

as "a brother who has been traveling around the country.

conference, previously mentioned, in September, 1967. He

has frequently been critical of United States involvement

in Vietnam and has stated he would "make a deal with the

Devil to secure the rights of black people in the United States."

Puerto Rican Involvement

Another developing situation of growing concern

is the possibility that Puerto Rican extremist elements

may coordinate their activities with elements of the

•black nationalist movement. For example, Stokely Carmichael

visited Puerto Rico in January, 1967, where an agreement

was. reached between SNCC and two local

"independence" groups

affirming a need for a joint Negro-Puerto Rican struggle

well as other issues including the Vietnam war.

Juan lari Bras, a leader of one of the independence groups:

attended the LASD conference in Havana, Cuba, in July, 1967,

where he supported the revolutionary policy of the Cuban

Government and stated that the recent pact signed between

his organization and SNCC would affect the coning battle

of the Negroes and the Puerto Ricans in New York City.

Mari Bras is involved in the recruiting of Puerto Ricans

for guerrilla warfare training in Cuba.

Communist Party, USA

The Communist Party, USA (CPUSA), has international

ties with other communist movements throughout the world. It

has been active in support of the black nationalist movement

in this country, it has solicited funds for SNCS, and it has

made liartin luther King a central figure for cosmunist

support. In October, 1967, a new position paper was

developed which included the folloring statement:

live

as Marxists have always affirmed that oppressed people

have the right to forcibly overthro: an oppressive regime

when the channels for democratic change are closed to them.

This right is affirmed in the Declaration of Independence.

Therefore, there can be no question of the right of black

people in the Jnited States to use violence to achieve

change."

Since communism thrives on discontent and chaos,

racial violence, hatred, and bigotry are grist for the

communist propaganda mill.

A primary connunist aim is to

alienate the Negroes against established authority.

Political and Security Council Affairs of the United Nations

Secretariat. Jambor has expressed interest in meeting rank-

United States, as well as interest in meeting with African

students in the United States who believe the war in Vietnam

is a racist war. He is willing to bear all expenses involved

in arranging for such meetings. C

Jambor was previously assigned to the United Nations

in 1961, at which time he exhibited a great interest in African

affairs. He is suspected of being an intelligence agent. c

Cuban potential for involvement

Allegations have been recaived to the effect that

the Government of Cuba is operating a training school for

Negroes for the purpose of engaging in subversive operations

against the

bring about a Nezro ravolution in the United States.e

While these allegations are largely unsubstantiated

to date, the potential for the training of Negroes in Cuba

certainly exists.e

The existence of Cuban Embassies in Mexico and

Canada and the existence of the Cuban Mission to the United

States in New York City, all heavily manned by trained

intelligence agents, together with the interest expressed

by Cuban officials in the black rationalist movement in this

country, certainly accentuate the possibility of involvement

by the Cubans in this movement. There is. little restriction

on the ease with which individuals affiliated with militant

Department of SNCC, previonsly mentioned as having traveled

with Carmichael to Cuba, also visited Hanoi during 1967. His

trip was sponsored and paid for by the Bertrand Russell Peace

Foundation, London, England. Lester is the author of an article

captioned "To Hell

With Protest" appearing in a recent SNCC

newsletter which contains a vicious attack on the President of

the United States and veiled threats to his safety.

Nunerous other members of SNCC have traveled abroad

during the year, 1967, seaking sippart for their movement.

They have reached sich far-flung countries as Cuba, England,

France, Sweden, Norway, Cambodia, North Vietnam, Tanzania,

Czechoslovakia, and Russia. John Tillman represented SNOO

at an anti-Vietnan conference hald in Bratislava, Czachoslovakia,

in Septenber, 1957, which was attended by representatives of North

Vietnam and the National Liberation. Front of South Vietnam.

Five members of SNCC traveled to Havana, Cuba, on

January 1, 1958, reportedly to attend

a "cultural" conference

in Havana scheduled for January 4 - il, 1968. This matter was

handled through the Cuban Mission to the United Nations.

Although billed as a cultural congress to include

writers, artists, 'and scientists from all over the world, the

general

theme of the conferance will be colonialism and neo-

colonialise and the announced

purpose is to obtain unity of

action in the Cuban anti-imperjallso fights.

FOREIGN INFLUENCES IN THE

BLACK NATIONALIST MOVEMENT

Indications are quite clear that SNCC is attempting

to obtain international

recognition. It has appointed a

Diractor of International Relations, James Forman, who is

stationed in New York City, and has attempted to establish an

international headquarters at Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Tanzania

would appear to be ideal for such a headquarters because of

that country's pro-comnunist orientation, the heavy influx of

•Comnunist Chinese technicians and scientists, and the large

Communist Chinese Embassy located there.

Further, Carmichael

in his public utterances abroad has called for international-

ization of the black power movement.

The development of international contacts by SNCC

could have begun as early as 1964 when some members of the

organization visited Guinea at the invitation of its President,

Sekou Toure., SNCC representatives participated in a national

youth seminar on racialism held in Ianzania in April, 1966.

James Forman participated in a United Nations Seminar on

Apartheid, Racial Discrimination and Colonialism

in Southern

Africa which was held in Zambia in July, 1957, in wnich a wide

variety of Governmental representatives

including some from

the USSR and other Soviet-bloc countries participated. Fay'

Bellamy, Vernon Crutchfield, Dwight Williams, and Muriel

Tillinghast, SNCC representatives, visited the Soviet Union

in June, 1966, at the invitation of the Soviet Committee of

Youth Organizations and at the suggestion of the Communist

Party, USA. The Soviet Union paid all the expenses of this

travel. William Hall, a SNCC representative, attended the

Seventh Congress of the World Federation of Democratic Youth,

a communist organization, in Bulgaria, in Juna, 1965.

Revolutionary Action Movement

The Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM) was formed

'in Detroit in 1953. It is an all-Negro black nationalist

organization active principally in New York City and Philadelphia,

Williams and members of RAM in the United States.

While

Williams was in Cube these lines of communications included

FOREIGN INFLUENCES IN THE

BLACK NATIONALIST MOVEMENT

Earnest Thomas, former Head of the Deacons of

Defense and Justica, a militant black nationalist group

originally formed for the ostensible purpose of providing

protection for Negro protest marchers in Louisiana,

traveled to Europe in the Sunmer and Fall of 1966: In

september of that year he was in touch with the Chinesa

diplomatic mission in London, England He visited Cuba

in July of 1966 where he claims to have sat in on a

cabinet meeting of the Cuban Government. Thomas has also

stated that a civil rights leader is obligated to enlist

support from any source willing to offer it including

the so-called communists.

Thomas was introduced by

Stokely Carmichael at a meeting in Chiçago, in May, 1967,

as "a brother who has been traveling around the country.

with me and what most people are talking about is that he's

been doing

a lot of jobs keeping us alive."

Willie Wright, President of the United Afro-American

Association, a militant black nationalist organization in

Newark, New

Jersey, was also in attendance at the Bratislava

conference, previously mentioned, in September, 1967. He

has fraquently been critical of United States involvement

in Vietnam and has stated he would "make a deal with the

Davil to secure the rights of black people in the United States."

Puerto Rican Involvement

Another developing situation of growing concern

is the possibility that Puerto Rican extremist elements

may coordinate their activities with elements of the

black nationalist movement. For example, Stokely Carnichael

visited Puerto Rico in January, 1967, where an agreement

was. reached between SNCC and two local "independence" groups

affirming a need, for a joint Negro-Puerto Rican struggle

Juan liari Bras, a leader of one of the independence groups.

attended the LASO conference in Havana, Cuba, in July, 1967,

where he

supported the revolutionary policy of the Cuban

Government and stated that the recent pact signed between

his organization and SNCC would affect the coming battle

of the Negroes and the Puerto Ricans in New York City.

Mari Bras is involved in the recruiting of Puerto Ricans

for guerrilla warfare training in Cuba.

Communist Party, USA

The Communist Party, USA (CPUSA) , has international

ties with other communist movements throughout the world.

has been active in support of the black nationalist movement

in this country, it has solicited funds for SNCC, and it has

made Martin luther King a central figure for co munist

support. In October, 1967s a new position paper was

developed which included the following statement:

as Marxists have always affirmed that oppressed people

have the right to forcibly overthrow an oppressive regime .

when the channels for democratic change are closed to them.

This right is affirmed in the Declaration of Independence.

Therefore, there can be no question of the right of black

people in the United States to use violence to achieve

change."

Since communism thrives on discontent and chaos;

racial violence, hatred, and bigotry are grist for the

communist propaganda mill.

A primary connunist aim is to

alienate the Negroes against established authority.

Czechoslovakian interest

Jiri Jambor, a Czechoslovakian national, recently

returned to the United Nations as Political Affairs Officer,

Political and Security Council Affairs of the United Nations

Secretariat. Jambor has expressed interest in meeting rank-

and-file members of the black nationalist movement in the

United States, as well as interest in meeting with African

students in the United States who believe the war in Vietnam

is a racist war. He is willing to bear all expenses involved

in arranging for such meetings. C

Jambor was previously assigned to the United Nations

in 1961, at which time he axhibited a great interest in African

affairs. He is suspected of being an intelligence agent. C

Cuban potential for involvement

Allegations have been received

to the effect that

the Government of Cuba is operating a training school for

Negroes for the purpose of engaging in subversive operations

against the United States. The purported objective is to

bring about a Nezro ravolution in the United States.C.g-

While these allegations are largely unsubstantiated

to date, the potential for the training of Negroes in Cuba

certainly exists. C

The existence of Cuban Embassies in Mexico and

Canada and the existence of the Cuban Mission to the United

States in New York City, all heavily manned by trained

intelligence agents, together with the interest expressed

by Cuban officials in the black nationalist movement in this

country, certainly accentuate the possibility of involvement

by the Cubans in this movement. There is little restriction

on the ease with which individuals affiliated with militant

black nationalist groups in the United States can travel to

Canada, Mexico and even to Cuba. C

The Cuban refugee channels through which Cubans are

introduced into the United

States present

were advised of the beginning of a Counterintelligence

Program against militant Black Nationalist-Hate Groups:

Albany

Atlanta

Baltimore

Boston

Buffalo

Charlotte

Chicago

Cincinnati

Cleveland

Detroit

Jackson "'""irst"

Memphis

Newark

New Orleans

New York

Philadelphia

Phoenix

Pittsburgh

Richmond

St. Louig

San Francisco

Fashingon Field:

Los Angeles

Each of the above offices was to designate a

Special Agent to coordinate this program. Replies to this

letter indicated an interest in counterintelligence against

militant black nationalist groups that foment violence and

several offices outlined procedures which had been effective

in the past.

For example, Washington Field Office had

furnished information about a new Nation of IBian (NOI)

grade school to appropriate authorities in the District

of Columbia who investigated to determine if the school

conforned to District regulations for private schools. In

the process WFO obtained background information on the parents

of each pupil.

The Revolutionary Action bovement (RAh), a pro-

Chinese comunist groug, was active in Philadelphia, Pa.,

in the summes of 1967.

The Philadelphia Office alerted

local police, who then put RAl leaders under close scrutiny.

They were arrested on every possible charge until they could

no longer make bail. As a result, RAM leaders spent most ofthe

summer in jail and no violence traceable to RAM took place:

The Counterintelligence Program is now being

expanded to include 4i oices.

Each of the offices added

to this program should designate an Agent familiar with black

nationalist activity, and interested in counterintelligence,

to coordinate this program,

This Agent will be responsible

for the periodic progress letters being requested, but each

Agent working this type of case should participate in the

formulation of counterintelligence operations.

GOALS

For maximum efiectiveness of the Counterintelligence

Program, and to prevent wasted effort, long-range goals

are

being set.

I: Prevent the coalition of militant black

nationalist groups.

In unity there is strength; a truien

that is no less valid for all its triteness.

An efiective

coalition of black nationalist groups night be the first

step toward a real "Hau Mau" in Anerica, the beginning of

a true black revolution.

2. Prevent the rise of a "messian" who could

unily,

and electrify, the militant black nationalist movement.

Malcolm X might have

been such a "hessiah;" he is the martyr

of the

movement today.

Martin Luther King, Stokely Carmichael

and Elijah Muhanned all aspire to this position.

Elijah

Huhaned is less of a threat because of his age: King could

be a very real contender for this position should he abandon

his supposed "obedience" to "white, liberal doctrines"

(nonviolence) and embrace black nationalism.

Carmichael

has the necessary charisna to be a real threat in this way.

3.

Prevent violence on the part of black

nationalist groups.

This is of primary importance, and is,

of course, a goal

of our investigative activity; it should

on the quality and quantity of positive inforuation

In the past. Ior example, Washington Field Office had

furnished inforsation about a new Nation of Islam (NOI)

grade school to appropriate authorities in the District

of Columbia who investigated to determine if the school

conformed to District regulations for private schools. In

the process WO obtained background information on the parents

The Revolutionary action Movement (RAM), a pro-

Chinese connunist group, was active in Philadelphia, Pa.,

in the summer of 1967.

The Philadelphia Office alerted

local police, who then put RAM leaders under close scrutiny.

They were arrested of every possible charge until they could

no longer make bail. As a result, RAl leaders spent wost ofthe

nationalist activity, and interested in counterintelligence,

to coordinate this program.

This Agent will be responsible

for the periodic progress letters boing requested, but each

Agent working this type of case should participate in the

fornulation of counterintelligence operations.

GOALS

For maximum effectiveness of the Counterintelligence

Program, and to prevent wasted effort, long-range goals are

being set.

Prevent the coalition of militant black

nationalist groups.

In unity there is strength; a truism

that is no less valid for all its triteness. An eftective

coalition of black nationalist groups night be the first

step toward a real "Hau lau" in America, the beginning of

a true black revolution.

Prevent the rise of a "messian" who could

unity, and electrify, the militant black nationalist movement:

Halcolm X might have been such a

"messiah;" he is the martys

of the movement today.

Martin

Luther King, Stokely Carmichael

and Elijah Muhanned all aspire

to this position.

Elijah

Huhanmed is less of a threat because of his age. King could..

be a very real contender for

this position should he abandon

his supposed "obedience" to "white, liberal doctrines"

(nonviolence) and embrace slack nationalisin.

Carmichael

has the necessary charisma to be a real threat in this way.

3.

Prevent velence on the part of black

nationalist groups. This is of primary importance, and is,

Of course, a goal of our investigative activity; it should

also be a

goal of the Counterintelligence Program. Through

counterintelligence it should be possible to pinpoint potential

troublemakers and neuralize them before they exercise their

potential for violence.

4. Prevent militant black nationalist groups and

leaders iron gaining respectability, by discrediting

• them

to three separate segments of the community.

The goal of

discrediting black nationalistsmust be handled tactically

in three ways. You must discredit these groups and

Individuals to, first, the responsible Negro community,

second, they must be discredited to the white connuntty,

(NEGRO MENS MEDIA)

In considering methods to neutralize black

natlonadst extremise groups you should consider: the use

of news nedia thai cater to the Negro cormunity. There are

nuncious Bespapers and radio stations aimed at a pridasily

Negro audience or readership.

It a situation arises where

pualicity ahout black nationalist extremists appears desirablo

you should detormine whether an Afro-Anericon nerspaper or.

a radio station ained at a Negro audience night be the best

mediun for such publicity. This would insure publicity withiu

the Negro compuarty.

When you submit counterintelligeuce recouendations

to the Bureau using the technique of publicity you should

adviso whether your offico has establiched, celiable, contrets

among flogro nors media who night be of assistance. Each SAC

Enould be alert to establish such contacis if not alrendy done.

The Eureau would welcome any conments or suggestions

along this line.

heads his own group called ACTION. ACTION has been very

active in picketing-type demonstrations in the St. Louis

area.

In spite of its record for avoiding racial

disturbances, the Not Mosque Nunber 28 must still be considered

& potential source of racial agitation.

The Mosque is strong

in both membership and finances and the discipline of both

the National and Local leaders is well evidence.

it is felt

that the primary area of other intelligence activity against

this organization should be concentrated toward discrediting

the leaders and the organization as & whole and thus

Irustrating their attenpts to increase their membership and

influence.

the above three mentioned ancivionals, who now

appear on the Rabble-rouser

Indox aro all excellent targets

for Counterintelligence action,

inasmuch as any one of them,

particularly HENRY THOMAS, might serve as a catalyst for individuals

1n tha area espousing Black Notiona11sm.

Another Individual of the St. Louis; Minsouri-last Sti

Louis, Illinois, area, dallas hunky hollins, is currently under

sctive investigation by this Division and the Springileld

•Offico.

ROLLINS is & Black Nationalist and currently the

coordinator with Dr. BENJAMIN SPOCK of the Coäference on

New: Politics.

Although recently convicted on a local narcoties

violation, ROLLINS is free on appeal bond and has suflered

no apparent lack of iniluence in the Black community.

It is felt that other intelligence activity

against THOMAS, RUNTERIA, GREEN and ROLLINS would be

particularly effective in preventing any unification or

coalition of various individuals in the st. Louis area, who

favor Black Nationalism.

Although this Division currently has no active.

Chapters of SNCC or Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM)

any attempts to start such organization in this Division

should receive concentrated Counterintelligence activity,

in order that these groups potential for violence could be

negated.

Development of Counterintelligence Interest

Recently & group of four to six or eight Negro

millzants, two from East St. Louis, Illinois, have been

making demands of local Negro radio stations which would

require these stations to participate in black nationalist

propaganda.

These persons, or those connected with them,

have intimidated merchants

on a local level. Informants

have reported that these individuals have no backing by

Community Congress, a church financed civic organization.

prominent Negro leaders. One is HOWARD B. WOODS, who is

Editor and Publisher of the "St. Louis Sentinel"

, & Negro

newspaper.

HOODS is considered to be a high caliber person

holding sevesal important positions such as lormer Ass't.

Director, United States Information Agency, and Editor of

"Sengtacke", a syndicate headquartered in Chicago which

publishes approximately 14 Negro newspapers.

WOODS has

been concerned that these persons were using the headquarters

of the Mid-City Community Congress, an ostensible non

militant organization, for the planning of some of their

activity of which he disapproves.

ROODS is a 11aiSon source

of the St. Louis Division and has cooperated with the FBi

for several years.

Consideration is being given to enlist-

ment of WOODS regarding some type of publicity which would

send to discourage or discredit these racial militants.

Black nationalist organizations and hate groups

remain as previously described in referenced St. Louis letter.

No definable nev organizations have developed and leadership

in existing organizations remains as it was last outlined.

The potential for violence of the Nation of Islam (NOI) does

not seem to have been effected by the passage of time since

4/5/68.

The Agitator Index of the St. Louis Division presently

includes HENRY THOMAS, JOSE RANCHECO RENTERIA, III, and

PERCY GREAN aS previously outlined.

JAMES HENRY ROLLINS,

who was briefly described in the prior communication, has

since been placed on the Agitator Index as has MICHAEL KIMBLI,

who was discussed previously.

KIMBLI was permitted to travel

to St. Louis by the Pennsylvania paroling authority in

January, 1968, alter conviction and parole on 1/8/68, resulcing

from charges of inciting to riot at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

on 8/25/67.

KiBLi was subsequently arrested at st.,

LOuis

4/28/68 for the previously mentioned burglary.

CLARENCE GUTHRIE, 2 Negro agitator who was one

of the prime movers in demands made on local Negro redio

stations and who claims to be a member of the Black, Economic

Union o1 fast st. Louis, Illinois, appears to be emerging

as one against whom counterintelligence activities might

be conducted in the future. GUTHRIE has also claimed

membership in the so far non-militant Mid-City Community

Congress of St. Louis.

Submission of instant letter is delayed due to

extensive investigation required by the Murkin case, and

the extended illness of the person exclusively assigned

to Blacpro matters and the Racial Intelligence Irogrann.

Development of Counterintelligence Interest

Recently a group of four to six or eight Negro

militants, two from East St. Louis, Illinois, have been

making demands of local Negro radio scations which would

require these stations to participate in black nationalist

propaganda.

These persons, or those connected with them,

have intimidated merchents

on & local level. Informants

have reported that these individuals have no backing by

legitimate organizations or groups, but have used Mid-City

Community Congress, a church financed civic organization.

In doing so these persons have raised the ire of some

prominent Negro leaders.

One is HOWARD B. WOODS, who is

Editor and Publisher of the "St, Louis Sentinel"

, a Negro

newspaper.

WOODS is considered to be a high caliber parson

holding several important positions such as former Ass't.

Director, United States Information Agency, and Editor of

"Sengtacke", a syndicate headquartered in Chicago which

publishes approximately 14 Negro newspapers.

wOODS has

been concerned that these persons were using the headquarters

of the Mid-City Community Congress, an ostensible non•

militant organization, for the planning of some of their

activity of which he disapproves.

WOODS is a liaison source

of the St. Louis Division and has cooperated with the FBI

los several years.

Consideration is being given to enlist

ment of WOODS regarding some type of publicity which would

tend to discourage or discredit these racial militants.

Black nationalist organizations and hate groups

remain as previously described in referenced St. Louis letter.

No definable new organizations have developed and leadership

in existing organizations remains as it was last outlined.

The potential for violence of the Nation of Islam (NOI) does

not seem to have been effected by the passage of time since

4/5/68.

The Agitator Index of the St. Louis Division presently

Includes FUENRY THOMAS, JOSE RANCHECO RENTERIA, III, and

PERCY GREEN as previously outlined.

JAMES HENRY ROLLINS,

who was briefly described in the prios communication, has

since been placed on the Agitator Index as has MICHAEL KIMBLI,

who was discussed previously. KIMBLI was permitted to travel

to St. Louis by the Pennsylvania paroling authority In

January, 1968, after conviction and parole on 1/8/68, resulting

from charges of inciting to riot at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

• 8/25/67 .

on 4/28/68

KIMBLI was subsequently arrested at st. Louis

for the previously mentioned burglary.

CLARENCE CUTHRIE, & Negro agitator who was one

of the prime movers in demands made on local Negro radio

stations and who claims to be a member of the Black Economie

Union of East St. Louis, Illinois, appears to be emerging

as one against whom counterintelligence activities might

be conducted in the future. GUTHRIE has also clained

menbership in the so far non-militant Mid-City Community

Congress of St. Louis.

Submission of instant letter is delayed due to

the extended illness of the person exclusively assigned

Utilizing the same sources to publicize

contrasting Black Panther leaders in a less favorable

light, thereby creating the climate for factional

3. Have law enforcement agents pick up a Black

entitled "Black People Choose!"

I, Background

The Black Liberators (Bufile 157-10356) and the

Zulu 1200 (Bufile 157-9856) are two of the lorenost Black

Militant groups in the St. Louis area.

The Zulu 1200's have

been in existence since 1/68, and are

far less nilitant than

the Liberators who originated in latter summer 1968.

A

degree of friction between the two exists which can

be

exploited although the two groups do bave similar aims and

share sone dual. menbers.

as of this priting, the liberators,

= pseudo-military group who emulate the Black Panthers,

appear to garner nost of the neuspaper publicity locally

and are recruiting at a faster rate than the Zulu's.

22.

Explanation of Flyer

The enclosed flyer was prepared by the St. Louls

Division and its tenor and vocabulary were carefully chosen

to give the impression it was written and reproduced by

local Black Militants.

It is purposely slanted to give the

impression that the Zulu's may have had a key role in its

preparation although this is not stated. Intentional errors

of typing and spelling in the flyer were inserted

its

"authenticity".

to add to

Most of the information in the flyer is relatively

true; at least most of the Zulu 1200's have expressed similar

complaints.

the flyer does emphasize and exaggerate

§the differences of the two groups in degrading the Liberators.

The flyer is designed to spread dissension and

the Liberators will logically be very distressed with the

the flysr will stir up enough controversy among the militants

In any case, it is felt that

that just deciding no really produced it, and how to deal

with the situation, can be expected to result in time consuning

efforts which will

detract from the time and energy the

militants ordinarily spend on plotting, recruiting, and

fund-raising.

Recommendation

i stir.

=*86, Louds: Division proposes to produca 300. copies

of this flyer

locally exactly as they appear in the enclosure.

These were reproduced on the office duplicating nachine, which

is not significant from a security standpoint since all

the militant groups in this area have access to similar

duplicating machines in churches, colleges.

and places or

business;

and in fact, most of their ow Ilterature is

produced

in this manner

Flyers will be malled anonymously in ordinary,

inexpensive envelopes which will be purchased fron downtown

five-and-ten stores. Ordinary stamps will be used and

disguised handwriting will address the envelopes which will

have. no return address although they will be mailed at

various mail boxes downtown.

Bt. Louis proposes to send the flyer to inown

Black Liberators, other Black Nationalists, offices and

officors of various Negro groups; this will include the

St. Louis, Missouri and East St. Louis, Illinois area.

Copies will not be sent to Zulu 1200 members, so when

inquiries ara made of their office and leaders, their denial

o1 its existence will sorve to increase suspicion that they

produced it.

St. Louis, through its racial informants and sources,

will be able to determine the effect of this flyer in its

proposed intent.

entitled "Black People Choose!"

1. Background

The Black Liberators (Bufile 157-10356) and the

Zulu 1200 (Bufile 1579866) are two of the foremost Black

Militant groups in the St. Louis area,

The Zulu 1200's have

bean in existence since 1/68, and are

far less militant than

the Liberators who originated in latter summer 1968.

degree of friction between the two exists which can be

exploited although the two groups do have similar ains and

share some dual members.

As of this priting, the Liberators,

& pseudo-military group

who emulate the Black Panthers,

appear to garner most of the newspaper publicity-locally

and

are recruiting at a faster rate than the Zulu's.

Explanation of Flyer

The enclosed flyer was prepared by the St. Louis

Division and its tenor and vocabulary were carefully chosen

to give the impression it was written and reproduced by

local Black Militants.

It is purposely slanted to give the

impression that the Zulu's may have had a key role in its

preparation although this 18 not stated. Intentional errors

of typing and spelling in the flyer were inserted to add to

its "authenticity".

Most of the information in the flyer is relatively

true; at least most of the Zulu 1200's have expressed similar

complaints.

However

the flyer does emphasize and exaggerate

Athe differences of the two groups in degrading the liberators.

The flyer is designed to spread dissension and

increase

• friction between the two groups as well as hamper

Ilberstor recruiting efforts among the local Negross. It is

designed to put all militants in

a position of having to take

a stand on the liger, i.e, the Zulu'e are or are not trying

to "back-stab" the liberators with its distribution. Although

the Liberators will logically be very distressed with the

appearance of the

flyer, it is possible that the

Zulu's night

not deny that they produced it.

In any case, it 1s felt that

the flyer will stir up enough controversy among the militants

that just deciding who really produced it, and how to deal

with the situation, can be expected to result in time-consuming

efforts which w111

detract from the time and eneigy the

militants ordinarily spend on plotting, rocruiting, and

fund-xalsing.

3.

Recommendation

St. louds Division proposes

of this flyer locally exactly as they to produce 300 copies....

in the enclosure.

These were reproduced on the oiiice duplicating machine, which

is not significant from a security standpoint since all

of

the militant groups in this area have access to similar

auplicating machines in churches, coreges, and places 01

business, and in fact, most of thoir own Iterature Is :

produced

in this manner.

Flyers will be nailed anonymously in ordinary,

inoxpensive envelopes which will be purchased iron downtown'

five-and-ten stores. Ordinary stamps will be used and

disguised handwriting will address the envelopes which wild

have no return address although they will be nailed at

various

mail boxes downtown.

St. Louis proposes to send the flyer to known

Black Liberators, other Black Nationalists, offices and

officers of various Negio groups; this will include the

St, Louis,

Missouri and East St.

Louis, Illinois area.

Copies will not be sent to Zulu 1200 members, 50 when

inquiries are made of their office and leaders, their denial

of its existence will serve to increase suspicion

that they

produced it.

St. Louls, through its sacial informants and sources,

will be able to determine the effect of this flyer in its

proposed intent.

Enclosed for the Bureau are 3 copies of newspaper

In accordance with Bureau authority, approximately

200 of the "Black People Choose" flyers were produced and

mailed anonymously to various Black Nationalist groups and

leaders in

the greater St. Louis area during the weekend of

11/8-10/68.

The results of this counterintelligence action vere

On 11-11-68, Det. JOHN SILBANIAN, Intelligence Unit,

St. Louis PD, made available to SA JACK A.

FRENCH a copy of

the flyer which one of their policemen had been furnished

on the street by an unknown Negro male. The Negro male told

the officer

at the time, "Looks like them Zulu's are asking

for trouble."

On 11-12-68, a confidential source of the SL Division,

WALDORE SINGFIELD, adViSed SA PEMBROKE VASHINGTON that the

questioned flyer had been received by several Negro secretaries

who are active in various Black groups in the area.

Their

concensus of opinion was that the flyer vas prepared by "white

hunkies" in the local chapter oi Students for Democratic Society

(SDS) and they were going to attempt to secure some sanple

envelopes from the SDS "hang-outs" to see if they compared

with the envelopes in which the flyers were received.

The pamphlet came out

after a big weekend for the

Liberators during which

Phil Hutchings,

national

chairman of SNCC (Student

public rally that the Lib-

erators along

also noted that Koen had

been named a national offi-

cial of the affiliated groups.

It also criticised the Libera-

tors for working out of St.

Stephens Episcopal church

on Park and for working

with whites.

White Minister Talks

The Rev. William Mathe-

us, a militant white minister

at St. Stephens, called the

Liberators a noble group

seeking

dignity"

to

"create black

and

"get their

thing together." He said the

Liberators are free to "uti-

lize the facilities of the

church" because they do not

have the finances and staff

to do all the work needed

from their office at 2810

Easton ave.

Recenty Charles (Chuck)

Koen, prime minister of the

Liberators participated in a

public black forum at St..

Stephens, which has white

ministers.

The Liberators

aiso conducted a recruiting

drive on the south side from

that church.

A

Liberator spokesman

agreed that the Liberators

ado use church facilities, but

declared that whites have

nothing to do with the ad-

ministration of the Black

Liberators.

Nw 55142 DocId: 32989761 Page 109.

Matheus added. "I doubt

seriously that the Zulus had

anything to do with this

vicious tract. After all, the

Zalus work from the

Mid-

City Community Congress

and worked with Webster

college students in cam-

paigns for housing blacks."

Ocie Pastard,

executive

director of the

Mid-City

Community Congress, where

* both

militant

groups

got

their start, said the Zulus

had nothing to do with the

• pamphlet. He added:

"Somebody wants

these

• two black groups to start

fighting. There have been

several

attempts to break

up the good

relationships

• between

Both

the two groups.

groups were

smart

enough to take it intelligent-

ly."

The pamphlet came out

after a big weekend for the

Liberators during which

Phil. Hutchings,

national

chairman of SNCC (Student

• Non-Violent Coordinating

Committee) announced at a

public rally that the Lib-

• erators

along with other

"black" groups such as the

Black Panthers were becom-

ing affiliates of SNCC. He

also noted that Koen had

been named a national offi-

cial of the affiliated groups.

In November, 1963, 200 flyers were anonymously nailed

and sources subsequently advised that the flyers and the resulting

publicity in the local nowspapers vere responsible or all but

clininating the previous good will that existed between the two

groups. It also hurt vhite liberal support of the Black Liborators.

Later in November a letter was sent to CHARiES KOEN,

Prime Minister of the Black Liberators, purportedly from sone

SDS students at lashingion University. It praised him and

criticized ISON DENT, & General in the Black Liberators, and

KOENI's "right-hand man". The letter apparently had an adverse

effect on the relations between SDS and the Black Liberaiors.

It is aiso possible that the letter germinated a seed of distrust

in the friendship of KOEN and DENT.

4) Developments of Counterintelligence Interest.

Since the date of referenced communication, the Zulu

The deepening schis:

ithin the Negro communily over taclics or

... i, goats, gicetully fostered anu distorled by insensitive and irresponsible new.

• miesia, is headed toward a major internal crisis requiring each of us to stand

up and be counted. Differences among bleus folk in this rouniry are nos

new, but a new ingredient has been added the atiempt by a small minority

of black extremisis to force compliance with its views and icclics. This

nihilistic minority professes disdain for all "white" values ihile at the same

time invoking and utilizing, as insiruments of controversy, the viorsi proc-

fices of the most benighted straium of while socialy, to vit, cbscene name-

colling, threats, intimidation, suppression of opposing views and violence.

The emergence of this swaggering bond of block extremists demand-

ing abandonmeni of democralic methods and goals and a reversai of the

trend toward integralion musi be met head-on by the vast majority of

Negroes viho reject the minorily's tactics and goais. To be sure, the new

mood has baon generaied by white Arrerica's historic racism. in furr, the

new black mood nurtures further white racism.

Campaigning in New York City last month, Senator Edmund S. Muskie,

the Democratic nominee for Vice President, chollenged responsible people

of both races to speak up. "Ve must break through the terrible cycle of

action and reaction, assault and counter-assault, hatred and response to

hatred," he said.

"The only way to break this vicious cycle," Senator Muskie continued,

"is for the moderates in boih communities so cope with the merchants of

•hate and violence within their own ranks. To dale, the moderates-both

black and white have been too silent."

On our pari, as on the part of white folk, there is urgent need for

strong and unequivocal re-afirmation of our commitment to the democratic

processes as d means of attaining, here in our homeland, full, equal and

unfettered righis for America's 22,000,000 black folk. This means a repu-

diation of the nihilism of the exiremists who are shrilly and insisiently

espousing apartheid; racism, including anti-Semitism; intimidation and vio-

lence.

• Most fatuous of the extremists' exhortations is the call for "black revolu-

tion"-the seizure of power by the Negro minority. Any revolution remotely

possible in this country at this time would not be one that advances the

• position and cause of Negroes. Rather it would ba a revolution of the Right

suppressing not only the black community but also curiciling the basic

liberties of the total society.

Repsated surveys and polls by reputable and importial opinion lesters

show that this minority misrepresents the true views and aspirations of the

majority of the nation's Negro population. A September, 1968, survay by

the Columbia Broadcasting System found that the "great majority of

Negroes still want integration and want to achieve equality through legal

means. Only a very small minority of Negroes approve of violent tactics,

nine out of ten in the survey expressing disapproval of violence to achiave

equality."

Nohvithstanding the evidence ihat the Negro masses remin com-

mitted to the program and tacies which lave brought substantal gains

in the struggle for equality, the voices writhin the Negro community which

publicly express this majority view have been few and, often, lonely.

Partly this has been because of a tendency on the port of the naws media

to by-pass spokesmen for the majorily and to project the minorily spokes-

men as the authentic voices of the Negro community. There is the additional

facior that responsible leaders who speak out against the extremists have

been subjecied to threats of violence. Mercover, Negro leaders have tradi-

tionally been reluctant to speak out publialy in opposition to other clack.

spokesmen.

But the time has come for specking out loud and clear lest the entire

race be branded as hate mongers, segregationists, advocales of ciolence,

and worse. The silent majority must lat its views be knewn not meraly in polls

but also in print,

on the rostrum, and via radio and television. Tro lime

for silence or muted voices is past. The extremists inust be answered promptly

and forihrighily in the name of the majority. Their racisin and ani-Semitisn

So il is toslax. Les there be "no uncertain sound" on the issue con-

fronting us. To make the record clear, let us repeat again and aguin so

that none need be unaware of the Truth: Black America rejects and con- .

demas separation, racism, intimidation, suppression of free spaech, and

violence. Let it be finown that the preachers of hate, the defeatists afraid
