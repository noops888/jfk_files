and questions to ask Chestor Bowlas, Special Advisor to the

President, who vill ellegedly appear before it.. Varona did not

identify cho Senate Committae and did not atete when Lowles was

Aragon asked Varona why he was coing this as this

would place tha CRC in a very bad position with the Kennedy

Administration.: Varons in raply stated he felt that if such

information were furnished the Republicans, the Kennedy

Aaministration would be forced to take direct action immediately.

Aragon told Varona that he did not agree with him and that he

thought Varona's actions would place Cardona and the CRC in an

emborrassing position with officials of the Kennedy Administration.

Varone stated he had the reputation of being "the bad boy" of:

che CRG and might as well act eccordingly...

Varone also stated

that if his actions forced the Kennady Administration to do

something drastic, he balleved his actions rould be justified.
