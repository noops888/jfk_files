opening individual cases on those persons zather than

veloping the information in captioned matter.

It does

not appear that more membership or leadership in captioned

organization is sufficient basis for opening such cases

unless the activities of the individuals come within the

purview of Section 87 D of the Manual of Instructions or

ndet the criteria for the Security Index or one of the

Reserve Indices.

Rerep is classified "Confidential." Cover

Page D states it is so classified since data reported by

T-I "could reasonably result in identification of a

confidential source of

continuing value and compromise the

electiveness thereoi."

T-l is identified on Cover Page C

who requested his identity be protected.

The major criteria for classifying a communication is

whether the disclosure of the information or the compromising

of a source or informant would adversely affect the national

defense intorests of

the Nation. It cannot be seen how the

compromising of

who is not an established confidential

source or informant,

would have such an adverse effect.

Denver should re-evaluate this nutter and advise by return

airtel whether or not the report should remain classified as

dissemination is being held in abeyance pending receipt of

this information.

5. Rerep discloses that most of the information

reported deals with the Denver area.

Denver should advise

by return airtel' the extent and results of the investigation

conducted to determine if there are any units of "Minutemen"

active in the other parts of Colorado and in the State of

Wyoming.

The above should receive expeditious attention.
