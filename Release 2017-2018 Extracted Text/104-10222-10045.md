NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

Gloo recommendations lor his fearing.

future personnal oxltona.

This officer Is an extremely willing and hard worker. From the technical

slandpoint his performance is satisfactory in every sense.

He devotes long hours

to kceping the equipment in perfect working order and Is always willing and ready

to accept any extra assignment given him regardless of his personal and family

commitments. Hle principal weakness is his almost total Inability to write clear,

conclae reports. Because he lacks aggressiveness and duc to his limited knowledge

of the Spanish language he has been unable to provide first rate case officer control

over the LP under his command.

This is at Icast partlally due to the fact that the

indigenous personnel resent to some extent being under the control of a PBPRIMER

and prefer to take Instructions from the indigenous case officer (LIENVOY/2).

This le not because of the KUBARK Case Officer's personality but because of pride

of natlonally. As a matter of fact, this officer has a very pleasant personality

and gets alung well with his co-workers. With respect to this officer's potential

and future development the rating officer recommends that at the conclusion of

his present sour In June of 1962 that he be reassigned to Headquarters for extensive

Thls training perlod should include basic english, reports writing and

trade craft. L he la to continue as a technical case officer he should also have

further technical training depending upon his future assignments.
