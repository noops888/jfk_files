his wire and his Iriend, SALVAIORE LO MEDICO, and LO MEDICO E

wire.

They were going to drive to Las Vegas, Nevada.

told him that while in Las Vegas he would meet with ANTHONY

ZERILLI (son of JOE ZERILLI, IN boss of the Detroit Family)

and wich FRIZIOLA's son-in-Law, MIKE POLIZI, also of

cecrolt. he stated that PRIZIOLA was going to Las Vegas

for a vacation, but that there would also be a business

conference regarding the Detroit Family's Investment In the

New Frontier Hotel, Las Vegas. He explained that according

to PRIZIOLA there are apparently 15 points in the New Frontier

which have not been assigned. The informant belleved there

was a basic dispute on the assignment of these 15 points

between the Detroit and Chicago Families.

Because of this

the publicity in the New York area regarding the FBI digging

up bodies in nearby New Jersey.

The informant got the impression that the Chieago

Family feels it has "first crack" at obtaining the unassigned

15 points, but that the leadership in the Detroit Fanily

apparently would prefer some other group to have the 15 points.

The informant stated that in his opinion the Detroit Family

owns the major interest in the New Frontier.

He was unable to

give a dollar value to the 15 points.

He further claimed of not

knowing what other group the Detroit

Fanily would prefer to have

the points.

He stated that JOHN ROSSELLI of Hollywood would

represent the Chicago Family at this meeting in Las Vegas to

determine the assignment of the 15 points.

The informant advised that he had complained bitterly

tO PRIZIOLA about all the work he has done for the LON during

his lifetime and that now he is broke, out of work, and feels

he should be given a cut in a "good investment"

Informant a small interest in the New Frontier. He stated,

however, that if the Chicago Family is suecessful in getting

one so polnte on the New wrontier.

PRIZIOLA would probably

then claim to was up to rossiu to give the intormant some-

thing out of the 15 points.

the intormant advised that he has discussed this

with ROSSETTI at los Angeles recently and ROSSELLI will

recommend to GIANCANA that he be given a small cut in the

15 points 'if the Chicago Family obtains them.

The informant advised that he is attempting to get

about $2,000 a month, but that he would be happy to settle

for $1,000 a month.

The informant was specifically questioned regarding

the possibility of a commission member attending any such

meeting in Ias Vegas. He doubted 1t.

He stated that in view

of the "heat" in the newspapers regarding organized crime,

he doubted a commission member would be in attendance.

He advised, however, that it would be very simple

for them to arrive at a conclusion and arrange for a guarded

celephone conversation with a commission representative.

He stated that if such a meeting ocours in las

Vegas it will be done wherever and whenever they find it

most convenient, such as strolling along the fairway of a

golf course or some other suitable place which would be

secure for their purposes.

The informant was specifically asked if some other

ION families were attempting to get the 15 points and he

again claimed not having any knowledge in this regard.

He

was spectricaLly asked about the Kansas City Family, and he

claimed thas in his opinion he doubted it as cheir investment

now was in the Landmark Hotel in Las Vegas.

He claimed he

did not know the amount of the Kansas City investment in

Tas Vegas..
