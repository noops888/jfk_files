Pittsburgh letter dated 12-28-59, requested Bureau authority to

make a survey to determine the feasibility of establishing a MISUR at a

cottage owned by subject. On 12-31-59,

the Bureau granted authority and

the results of the survey were recorded in Pittsburgh letter dated 1-25-60.

The survey reflected that the only feasible means of establishing MISUR

coverage at that time was to use radio-microphone techniques. By letter

dated 2-1-60, the Bureau observed that a radio-microphone might be

feasible in this instance, but pointed out that such equipment as was then

available to the Laboratory had a relatively short life and would not be

suitable in an installation where long life was required. In subsequent

correspondence, possible alternative means of obtaining coverage were

considered and ruled out because of technical and physical limitations.

In view of the above, Pittsburgh will be interested to know that,

subsequent to the above communications, the Laboratory has developed

and constructed a completely transistorized battery (or AC) powered

miniature transmitter (known as the MUTT transmitter) together with

appropriate receiving equipment. This equipment is now ready for field

use.

It is relatively immune to the weaknesses of older equipment (as

described-in Bulet dated 2-1-60) and, therefore, is suitable for use in a

radio-microphone installation such as originally proposed by Pittsburgh.

The transmission system consists of one or more variable

yeluctance microphones (approximately / 32" by 12/32' by 19/32°) and a

MUTT transmitter (approximately 9/16" by 1 13/16" by 31/4"). The

transmitter can be powered by one or more small batteries or by means

of a transistorized 117 volt AC power supply (approximately 11/16 by

CO

1/2'' by 31/2). The receiving equipment consists of either a highly

bortable battery powered receiver or a slightly less portable 117 volt AC

powered receiver.

The range of the MUTT transmitter varies with

transmission and reception conditions; but is known to be as high as 1/2

mile under ideal conditions. Life of readily concealable battery supply is

approximately six days. 1D.su m
