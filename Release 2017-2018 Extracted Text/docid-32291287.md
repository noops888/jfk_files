WEEKLY SUMMARY

MM 509-C-TE advised that HARRY WILENSKY and HERMAN

a club, known as

*Past Time Bridge and Pinochle Club" in Room 214 and 215

of the Harvey Building,

Miami Beach /for bookmaking, shys

locking and card playing activities.

They had planned to

employ THEODORE: SKOROUSKI, who did handle the bookmaking

at the South Beach Democratic Club, Miami Beach, but some

difficulty arose between SKOROUSKI and one of the WILENSKY

brothers and they instead acquired the services of HARRY

PALANCE to handle the bookmaking operation.

PALANCE used

to be a partner of RUTH GASSENHEIMER in the operation of

the Patio Bridge Club about 10 years ago and during the

past winter season was connected with the bookmaking and

card playing operation at the Royalton Hotel Club in

Miami..
