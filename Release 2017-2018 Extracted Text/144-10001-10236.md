M/R:

(€_CC0) FOIA referral of a document containing a list of

the dates of NSA reports used by the CIA to compile records

pertaining to U.S. defectors to the USSR. The document was

located pursuant to a request for records between the CIA and

the U.S.

House Select Committee on Assassinations relating to

President Kennedy•

(9 860) The document with the NSA information is not

classified in and of itself. Its association with records

pertaining to the Kennedy assassination is also not classified.

The association with the records pertaining to defectors to the

USSR, however, is classified SECRET-CCO.

We are, therefore,

advising the CIA that the identification of NSA on the document

is to be redacted pursuant to b(1) and b (3) /403(d) (3). We ask

that CIA not name NSA as the source of the

information or

redaction.
