ZERVOS added that approximately three months ago while in

Washington, D. C., to visit a friend in the Greek Diplomatic

Service at

the Greek Embassy, he stopped at the Department

of Justice to say hello to MR. ANDERSON, but he was not in

Washington at the time.

2ERVOS said that upon his return

to Pittsburgh, Pa., he received a personal note from MR.

ANDERSON apologizing for his absence and inviting ZERVOS

to make it a point to telephone him for lunch when he

visited Washington again.

In the process of developing ZERVOS as an informant, he has

been instructed

and ' reminded periodically to consider his

relationship with Special Agents ôf the FBI confidential

and to furnish information only to the Bureau.

Nevertheless,

1t seems reasonable to assume that because of the closeness

of their alleged friendship ZERVOS might disclose his

informant

statús to MR. ANDERSON and furnish information

regarding the activities of the MANNARINO brothers on his

next trip to Washington.

Consequently, in order to avoid a situation of potential

embarrassment, ZERVOS is being deleted as a Pol of this

office.

Inthe future, information will be accepted from

ZERVOS on a voluntary basis and he will be considered a

voluntare ant an

confidential source.
