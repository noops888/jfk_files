• CG 92-3262

On August 19, 1973, CG I-l stated that he has

been in contact with

IRV WEINER and was assured by WEINER that

is apparently not worried about it. CG T-l advised it is

possible to interpret WEINER's remarks in a number of ways;

however, CG T-1 feels that WEINER really was telling him that

"the fix is in"

and that WEINER had made some kind of a deal

which would enable him to survive andintensive Federal Grand

Jury investigation

into a Central States Teamsters Union Pen-

sion Fund loan to a plastics firm partly owned by WEINER

in Deming, New Mexico.

According to CG T-1, WEINER is

receiving legal representation in this matter from Attorney

ALBERT JENNER, Who, WEINER states, is close to United

State's Attorney JAMES THOMPSON.
