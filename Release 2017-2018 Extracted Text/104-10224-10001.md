MENORANTUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Mr.

The meeting with Mr.

request to revier bis offislal personnal iile (this matter vas

tetag treated' in the manner of a request under the Freedo si

Incormation Ast).

Location: Main Reception Interview Raza at

Readquarters Bulldiag - 3. p.t.

The duration of the meeting was one (1) hour of which tine

used approzimately T to 8 minutea to quietly 1bno-.

thou the OPF. It is mi lapresston that he was ourprised: 1) ve

here allowing hin to see all the material in the file (he cesaribed

risidly, a 1971 unpleasant encounter with Mr. Echols; the Direster

o1 Fersonnel, who rerused to show him a document and would oni

read to him a small portion from lt - this caused his request and

sutsequent Interview with the DCI, Mr. Helma), and 2) at she

reslity that the file contained nothing actually derogatory

(he stated he had seen and aigned the fitneso reporta so these

represented nothing unknowa).

The major portion of the time was consumed In my listening

to: bis. evalustion and assessment of the varlous supervisors and

co-sorkers at NPIC and their shortcomings. He regaled me bits

med of his background and history with the milltary and 1n1:1al

application and entrance on duty with the Agency; his persons?

acqualatanse and relationsbips with notables - a former America?

Astassador to Ethiopla, Joseph Simonson, the imperor of subiogia,

several Generals and Congressional personalltlea, Mr. Helms and

Mr. Arthur Lundahl, and his membership in the Explorer Club.

Presently he is Vice President for Sales of the Environental

Coating Industries Corporation located In Annandale, VIrginia -

the company removes corrosion and stains from aurfaces.

offered the company servises at the 1974 Alumal session, to

clean the stains from the Nathan Hale statue at the front of the.

building, at a cost of $300. He plans to follow-up on his pro-

posal, since he has

not heard anything

from the Agensy.

ROUCATIONAL AMD PUCHOLOGICA!

August 24, 1966

Name: Mr. Myroslaw A. Maksymice

Mr. Myroslav A. Miksymice, age 49, came to this Burcau on August 1,

1966, in connection with the Veterans Administration's educational

vocational counseling progran for former servicemen.

Mr. Maksymice is

married, has two children;ages five and eight, and

is employed by a federal

govermental agency as a photographic research technician (GS 09/3).

retired From the United States Army in 1961 in the grade of Master Sergeant

after serving for over 20 ycars with primury duties as an intelligence

photographer. His education includes eight years of formal schooling, a

high school completion equivalence certificate, and additional courses with

the Graduate School, Department of Agriculture,

and the United States Armed

Forces Institute. Mr. Maksymice stated that he was interested in further

education at the college level in order to improve himself both personally

and professionally in a fleld related to his present vocational activities.

In addition to several conferences with the undersigned, Mr. Maksymiec

was administered a battery of educational and vocational tests.

This report

contains the results.of these confcrences and tests, the results of which

should not be interpreted either as conclusive or final.

considered primarily as indications of various psychological factors that

should be seriously considered by Mr. Maksymice in making decisions concer

ning his educational and vocational goals.

In order to determine Mr. Maksymiec's fields of vocational interest

he was given the Kuder Vocational Preference Record.

When comparcd to a

representative group of men

in the nationad population, Mr. Maksymiec in-

dicated that his interests are significantly similar to persons who are

engaged in computational, scientifie, and literary activities.

Men who have

interests similar to Mr. Maksymiec's

are found in various engincering fields,

astronomy j

scismology, economics, psychology, and technical publications

writing.

These fields are closcly allied to his present occupational endeavors.

On the Educational Interest Inventory, a device that is bencficial

to an individual in discovering his

intergsts in various fields of study,

Mr. Maksymiec's responscs indicated that his study

interests are very hish

in physics; high in engineering, chemistry, earth science, and history

political science; high average in communication, zoology, and mathematics;

and average in psychology.

the arcas in which he showed low to average

interest were music, education, industrial arts,

agriculture, botany,

sociology, literature, art, business administration, and economics.

Name: Myroslaw A. Maksymice

Mr. Mahisymice also took the Army Gencral Classification Test, Civilian

Edition, to find out his overall lovel of mental ability.

His score revealed

that he exceeds approximately 78 percent of adults in general mental capacity

as measured by this instrument.

A sater evaluation of his performance

that he is probably in the upper 25 percent of adults regarding his global

intelligence.

On the Nichigan Vocabulary Profile Test, an instrument that attempts

to measure a person's intollectual

interests as wull as the amount of infor

mation he.has retained in various arcas of knowledge, Mc. Maksynicc indicated,

when compared with college freshnen, that he exceeds approximately 50 percent

in his knowledge of human relations,

G9 percent in government, and 67 percent

in the plysical sciences.

On the lower side, he does as well

or better than

24 percent in his familiarity with cormerce,

3.l percent in mathematics, and

24 percent in fine arts.

In order to find out Mr. Miksymiec's ability to handle English, a

basic necessity for one to perform well in college, he was given the

Cooperative Diglish Tests.

When compared to college freshmen, he showed that

Tie excceds from 52 percent to 78 percent in his understanding

of vocabulary;

from 5 to l7 percent in his ability to comprehend what he reads; from 2 to

ll percent in his spocd of comprehension; and from 18 to 36 percent in his

overall ability to know and understand what he reads under timed conditions.

In his skill to express himself properly in English, lie exceeds from 1 to

6 percent of college freshmen.

When reading and expression are combined

into one score,

it may be said that Mr. Maksymier exceeds from 6 to 12 per-

cent of college freshmen in his overall usage of Engiish.

The results of the above tests indicate that Mr. Maksymiec has made

the most of his learning opportunities both within and

outside the military

Nithough he completed only eight years

of school, he has acquired

a considerable amount of knowledge by observation, reading,

and personal

experience.

In spite of his broad experiences and acquired knowledge,

be necessary. for him to improve his reading and writing skills in English,

however, before he begins college courses.

Although he manifests a high

interest in engineering

and scientific fields, he should probably not con-

sider these fields

as majors because of his deficiency in mathematics.

is believed the skills in English can be developed but it is doubtful if

the mathematical deficiencies can be overcome sufficiently to major in a

scientific

It is probably advisable, therefore, for Mr. Maksimice to

consider one of the social sciences as a college major.

His background in

photography and military subjects, combined with a college major in an ap-

propriate social science would probably provide him with the necessary

qualifications to become a geographer or an intelligence analyst in govern-

ment service.

It is understood that Mr. Maksymice has enrolled in Montogomery Junior

College, Takena Park, Maryland,

for the 1966 fall somester and that he will

take a special English course concentrating

on the fundamentals of reading

college to work toward a bachelor degree.

I have appreciated knowing, and talling with Mr. Maksymice and I trust

he will contact this Bureau if he requires further counseling assistance.

My bust wishes go with this report in whatever plans Mr. Maksymicc makes

concerning his future plans and gouls.
