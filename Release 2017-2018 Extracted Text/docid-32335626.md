ADMINISTRATIVE

Subject, ROBERT KENNETH BROWN has, in the past,

voluntarily contacted the Denver Office of the FBI directly

or through the Resident Agent in Boulder, Colorado.

He

appears to be a rather unstable individual. He states that he

is extremely Interested in the Cuban people but has also

indicated a rather personal, selfish reason for his trips to

Cuba in that he hopes to obtain information for a "big story"

that he can write and sell. It appears unlikely that BROWN 1s

engaged in any counter revolutionary activity directly and

it is doubtful that he could be effective while at Boulder.

In view thereol, this matter is being closea.

ground, in the United States and that his wife has just

returned from New York where she worked for the Cuban Under-

ground. Subject advised there were many factions of the

Cuban Underground in this country and indicated that they

might be able to get in touch with MORGAN in Cuba through

Underground contacts. On one occasion BROWN suggested

to T-1 that one CONSTANTINE KANGLES, 5140 100 North

that KANGLES is an attorney and is CASTRO's legal advisor

in the United States, and might be able to assist in getting
