CIA files relating to Ruby's Cuban activities

I. Jack Ruby's CIA file

Jack Ruby's CIA file contains a memorandum dated January

7, 1964 to the CIA from Hoover. This memorandum states

that

Carlos Villa furnished the FBI with a letter which had been

forwarded to a friend of his, Jose Antonio Juan. Mr. Juan

allegedly received the letter from his son in Cuba. The

letter states

it is known here that Rubenstein

was here a little less than a year

ago visiting a Mr. Pranski, owner

of shop dealing in Tourist articles

on Prado Street between Animas and

Trocadero opposite the Seville Biltmore.

(Memo, 1/7/64, To CIA from Hoover.) This memorandum also states

that the FBI has developed no information that Ruby visited.

Cuba except for one occasion in 1959. (Ibid.)

A memorandum for James Angleton from John Sherwood,

dated January 9, 1964, contained a translation of another

memorandum which was sent to Carlos Marquez Sterling. (FOIA

DoC. #

1213-1128). It states

The Brigadier of Giron, SI.

Evidicto

Pereira, who is in constant communication

with Cuba, informs the General Delegate of

the Movimiento Patriotico Cuba Libre,..

customer of a citizen named

shop for tourists located

between Animas y Trocadero, Paseo del

Prado, in front of the Hotel Sevilla.

This information received in Miami,

as noted at the beginning of this

memorandum,

were received by Brigadier

of Brigade 2506, Evidio Pereira, who

i ready to

verify them. New York,

29 December 1963.

(Ibid.)

A CIA cable from Miami, dated January 30, 1964, (WAVE 1283)

reports

that an article had appeared in the Miami News on

January 29 entitled "Ruby visited Cuba- Exiles Say." This

article stated Ruby flew from Mexico City to Havana in the

latter part of December 1962. This cable also states that the

DRE originally reported this allegation to the Miami station

on January 17, and the CIA had requested the DRE to provide

originals of the bulletin and letters containing these

allegations. (Ibid.)

A dispatch from Miami, dated February 13, 1964, states

that the letter, containing the allegations regarding Ruby,

was sent airmail from Cuba and postmarked December 28, 1963.

It was sent to a fictitious name, SRA. Juana Barreiros and

received at DRE Post Office Box 168 in Miami. It was also

reported by the DRE that the sender's name on the envelope,

Alicia: Cardoso, is false. The letter was received on January

13, 1964. This dispatch indicates Carlos-Valdes was interviewed

on February 4, 1964 who indicated the letter was from his

sister-in-law, Graziella Rubio y Rivera. He also stated

the story about Ruby was hearsay on the part of his

sister-in-law. (Ibid.)

The CIA has provided no information to indicate that

the Agency conducted any further investigation of this issue.

II. John Wilson Hudson File

A review of Hudson's CIA DDO file indicates that in a report

from

Idated August 8, 1957 or 1951 a source

was of the opinion that "Wilson was very probably an intelligence

agent and that he is under direction of some service."

(Report from

August 8, 1951, or 1957) On

October 6, 1959, a memorandum for the record reported that

Hudson was arrested with Paul Hugues in Cuba and that

Wilson may be summarized as a

person of intelligence, but so

erratic as to be considered

mentally unbalanced at

time. He is a soldier of fortune, having

begun his career in July 1936 when he left

Oxford to fight in Spain. He has been

accused of working for the intelligence

services of several countries, and he

himself has claimed to have acted on

behalf of different intelligence services.

He has been consistently anti-United States.

(Memo for the record 6 Oct. 1959, subj: "Carl John Wilson

Hudson.)

A 201 file request was submitted from

on October

29, 1959. (201 File Request, from WH/I/Chile, 10/29/59)

Handwritten at the bottem of this request is the statement

"In contact with suspected Soviet Agents." (Ibid.)

The nest file reference is in a cable dated December

19, 1959 from Havana to the

• Director of the CIA which states

that in Ref B (HAVA 2296) Havana station reported that

(unidentified) is in contact with John Carl

Wilson. (Cable, 19 Dec 1959, TO Dir from Havana, HAVA 3072)

AFter the assassination,

November 28, 1963, to the White House, the State Department,

and the FBI from the CIA reported the Hudson allegation

regarding Ruby and stated, "His story is being followed up."

(Classified Message, FOIA Doc.

any info they have on him.

(Cable to Dir fron

129 November 1963, FOIA DOC. # 233-94,

6115).

On December 12, 1963 the Deputy Director of Plans sent

a memorandum to the FBI detailing Hudson's background. (Memo

to Director of FBI from DDP, 12 December 1963, FOIA DOC. 385-736) .

This memorandmreported the arrest of Hudson in Cuba. It also

stated that

On August 1959 Wilson walked

into the U.S. Consulate, Kingston,

Jamaica, and

said he was a journalist

who had just been released after 54

days detention in Habana prison.

On 21 August 1959 the U.S. Consulate in

Kingston issued a single entry non-

immiqrant visa. He was carryina passport

147356 issued in Habana 14 August in the name

of John Wilson. He was attempting to get

his story to the Miami Herald

and then to obtain a new visa from

Chilean consulate to return home.

(UK or Chile not specified but

apparently he returned to UK).

(Ibid. at: 8).

The last entry in the file was a memorandum of a conversation

between Wilson and the First Secretary of the American Embassy

in London, dated April 7, 1964. (Memo of Conversation between

Wilson and Richard A. Ericson, JI., 4/7/64, London, Subj:

"Interest of Carl J. Wilson 'Hudson in POlitical Intelligence.")

Wilson indicated he had come to England early in the fall on

business, but was

planning to return to Chile. (Ibid.) The

comment made at the end of this report states

This is the second time Wilson has

approached me to. show an interest

in intelligence matters. The first

time was shortly after President

Kennedy was assassinated, when he

said that he had been imprisoned in

Havana by Castro in 1959. He alleged

that elea

that' while he was in prison, meals

for a fellow-prisoner, a former

gambling czar in Havana with early

associations with the Capone gang, had

been brought to the prison by a man

who identified himself as "Ruby" and who

bore a physical resemblence to the

man being tried for Oswlad's murder.

(Ibia.)

The Commitee has been provided with no evidence

to indicate any further" investigation was conducted by

the CIA with regard to Wilson Hudson.
