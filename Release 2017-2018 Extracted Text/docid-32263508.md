Dear Mr. Rhoads:

In conjunction with our investigation into the

circumstances surrounding the death of President Kennedy,

we hereby request the declassification of portions of a

memorandum to be used in our forthcoming hearings,

scheduled to begin on September 6th, 1978.

The document we are requesting partial declassi-

fication of is the November 24th, 1963 memorandum by President

Johnson's aide, Walter Jenkins,

setting forth a phone conver-

sation with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. A copy of the

memorandum is enclosed with this letter.

Most of the memorandum appears to have already

been made public, initially by the Senate Select Committee

on Intelligence in 1976. However, there is a lengthy para-

graph beginning at the bottom of page two of the memorandum

which is still classified as "secret."

We now request that the only portions of the

memorandum that remain classified be limited as follows:

"secret."

A.

All of the last paragraph on page 2,

which continues on to page 3, would

be declassified, except the two sen-

tences:

"For instance, Oswald made a

phone call to the Cuban Embassy in

Mexico City which we intercepted.

It was

only about a visa, however."

These two sentences could remain classified as

FBI into

We believe that the declassification of the

above portions of the memorandum is essential to our

Committee's investigation, and will not breach the con-

fidentiality of the other segments relating to sources

and methods which we are not now requesting declassification

of.

As our public hearings will begin on September

6th, 1978, we respectfully request your immediate attention

in assisting us with this matter. If you have any questions

regarding this, please contact.me at 225 2394.

Again, our thanks for your generous assistance

in the past.

Sincerely,

Gary owned
