TECHNICIANS ARE REMAINING AT THE SITES TO INSTRUCT AND ADVISE

THE CUBAN FORCES.

3. IN JANUARY 1964, RUSSIAN OIL-DRILLING CREWS STRUCK OIL

ON CAYO FRANCES; THE STRIKE IS PRODUCING 300 BARRELS A DAY. TO

GUARD THE INSTALLATION, SEVEN OR EIGHT YACHTS HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED TO

PATROL. THE AREA OF THE KEY AND BETWEEN 200 AND 300 MEN ARMED WITH

BAZOOKAS, MORTARS, AND RIFLES HAVE BEEN MOVED THERE. MANY OF THE

RIFLES ARE EQUIPPED WITH SNIPER SCOPES

4. AS OF EARLY FEBRUARY, THERE WERE RUSORS TO THE EFFECT

THAT A CONSPIRACY WITHIN THE MILITARY WAS BEING ORGANIZED. ALLEGEDLY

THE TALK OF SUCH A CONSPIRACY IS THUS FAR CLOSELY GUARDED BY MILITARY

OFFICERS. THE GROUP BEING ORGANIZED IS SAID TO BE COMPOSED OF ARSTY,

NAVY, AND POLICE OFFICERS OF HIGH RANK AND IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT

SOME SHALL ARMS HAVE ALREADY BEEN OBTAINED SECRETLY.

5. AFTER THE ATTACK ON THE THO PT BOATS NEAR ISLA DE PINOS,

ALL OTHER MILITARY WORK. HOWEVER, REPAIR CREWS ARE EXPERIENCING

DIFFICULTIES MAKING THE NECESSARY REPAIRS, SINCE THEY EITHER CANNOT

REPLACE THE DAMAGED PORTIONS OF MACHINERY BECAUSE THEY LACK THE

NECESSARY RUSSIAN SPARE PARTS OR CANNOT MAKE THE REPAIRS BECAUSE

OF LACK OF KNOW-HOW. (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: ANOTHER SOURCE

6. IN THE RECENT ATTACK AT SIGUANEA, ISLA DE PINOS, THE CUBAN

GUARDS DID NOT FIRE ON THE ATTACKERS BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID THEIR

SHOTS MIGHT SET OFF EXPLOSIVE CHARGES UNDER THE ROCKETS. THE PORT

OF CABAÑAS, ALTHOUGH REINFORCED SINCE RECENT ATTACKS, WOULD BE AN

EASIER TARGET FOR A RAID THAN THE ISLA DE PINOS AREA. THE PORT

IS PROTECTED BY ONLY A FEW GUARDS ON SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS, AND IT

IS PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE BETWEEN THE HOURS OF MIDNIGHT AND 3 A.M.
