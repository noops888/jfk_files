on 4/17/74 MM @115-s who has many contacts

among the Cuban exite community, reported that ROBERTO

PARDO,

son-in-law of TORRIENTF,

expressed the opinion

that a "business enemy" of TORRIENTE was responsible for

his death. He said that at one time, TORRIENTE advocated

military action against FIDEL CASTRO, but after realizing

the futility of

such action, TORRIENTE changed his opinion,

and adonted

a policy of co-existence with the CASTRO regime.

PARDO said that the policy of the Frente de Liberacion

Nacional

de Cuba (FLNC) is opposed and feels that military

action should not be abandoned. The FLNC has claimed

credit for a series of bombings during the recent past

MM 3142-PSI advised that on

4/21/74, Dr. MIRIAM BOSCH,

former wife of ORLANDO BOSCH,

disclosed that BOSCH had telephonedhis home a day or so

previously, and told his eldest daughter,

'"I am fishing

but don't worry, I am fine."

Mrs. BOSCH expressed

concern about the "Zero" organization and expressed the

belief

that BOSCH might be head of this group

She

felt

that the

"O" might stand for the "O" in Orlando.

(U)

On 4/23/74, MM 974-S, who has many contacts

among Cuban exiles in Miami, reported that ORLANDO

BOSCH and ANTONIO CALATAYUD,

head of the anti-CASTRO

organization known as the Directorio Revolucionario

were in New York City on the date that ARTURO RODRIGUEZ

RIVAS was killed (4/16/74). He advised that RODRIGUEZ

had the reputation of dealing in narcotics, but in the

past had been on friendly terms and worked

on anti-

CASTRO activities with ORLANDO BOSCH and also JUAN

"CHAVO" GARCIA.

GARCIA and RODRIGUEZ were allegedly

involved in narcotics peddling. He said that RODRIGUEZ

was also associated with IGNACIO and GUILLERMO NOVO in

the New York area,

and also with FELIX EGUES CASTILLA.

MM 974-S said that he had heard that two days before the

death of RODRIGUEZ,

that RODRIGUEZ met with BOSCH and

CALATAYUD. At that time, RODRIGUEZ was alleged to have

said that TORRIENTE and others who had collected money

in connection with the Plan Torriente should be killed

if they refused to return the money to the donors.

are well known to the New York and Newark Offices, for

that this belief has caused alarm among members of the

FLNC, since BOSCH,

who is also the Director of Accion

Cubana, does not have good relations with the FLNC

and is

believed capable at any moment of taking the

lives of members of the FLNC.

LOPEZ related that RODRIGUEZ

RIVAS of New York City was closely linked, with the

activities of the FLNC in that area, and that he has

already been murdered.

MM 1337-S also said that leaders

of the FLNC in the New York area believe that the

murderer belongs to Accion Cubana, although they have

not obtained evidence up to this point.

PALAU and (FNU) ELIAS are allegedly connected with the

It is also interesting to note that. Accion

the Associated Press in Miami on 3/3/74.
