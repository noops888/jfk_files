purpose of this unit appears to be the condueting of

harassment tactics and the aggravating of local Bogalusa

citizens such as BASCOM TALLEY, the former President of

the louisiana Bar aBsociation and owner of the local

neUspaper, LOU MAJORS, the editor of the Bogalusa news

paper, and RALPH BLUMBERG, the owner of a local Bogalusa

radio station. No 1271-R reported the reason for these

acts of harassnent is that all three individuals in the

past have been very open in their condemnation of the Xlan

and sintlar type organizations and that this harassuent

consists of placing dead animals at the residences of these

individuals, placing of roofing tacks in their driveways,

the New Orleans Office is of the opinion that

this "Minutemen" unlt in Bogalusa may not in any say be

connected with the national organization headed by BOBERT

Deputa of horborne, lissourd, and that walva, is nerely

using the name

"Minutemen."

wether this unit at Bogaluse is connected with the national

organization, NO 1271-R has advised that he has asked WARNER

for "Minutenen" literature so that the nembers could read

about the organization, and VAINth has stated that he does

not have ady Ilterature as this is one way that the FBI can

identify the members.

Further attenpts are boing made by

No 1271-R to determine If the unit at Bogalusa is in any

manner connected with the rational organization, and the

Bureau will be kept advised.
