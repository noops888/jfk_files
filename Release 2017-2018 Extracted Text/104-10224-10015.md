SUMMARY OF AGENCY EMPLOYMENT

JAMES W. MCCORD, JR.

Service with the Central Intelligence Agency began on 22

August 1951 and continued through 31 August 1970. During his

career there was a variety of assignments involving investigations,

research and report writing, technical and physical security programs

and a two year tour overscas.

As an investigator during the first two years of employment,

thore was wide involvement in a variety of support activities requiring

initiative and ingenuity.

During the seven years engaged in research and report writing.

there was much independence of action and success depended on

initlative, imagination and resourcefulness in pioncering new areas

of interest. Beginning in May 1957, managerial responsibilities

began with appointment to a Deputy Chief position of a research staff

of some six professional and clerical personnel.

When serving overseas, zesponsibilities were managerial in

nature as Chief of a regional staff of some ten professional and

clerical personnel providing a full spectrum of security support.

From August 1964 to June 1965 he attended the Air War

College as representative of the Agency-

Since 1965 two vital line positions were held involving the

Agency's programs in the technical and physical security fields.

In heading up the techaical security division, from 1965 to

1968, he had primary supervisory responsibility fur some

professional and clerical personnel, preparing the budget and pro-

grams for the Agency's technical security program, and managing

the obligating of authorized funding to assure that approved programs

and goals were met. He was instrumental in guiding the development

of new approaches, in establishing new training concepts and in

bringing the Agency to a position of recognized leadership in this

field.

total physical security program of the Agency. As a result of his

MEMORANDUM FOR:

THROUGH

Mr. Janse V. MeCard, Jr.

Head of 88 Career Service

SUBJECT

Notification of Non-eligibility for Designation as a

Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System

1. As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the employment

history and current career field of all employees in the Agency to identify

those who are ellgible for designation as a participant in the new CLA

Retirement and Disability System. In this process, the initial review of

each case is made by the individual's Career Service. If the Head of his

Career Service nominates him for participation in the system, chis nomina-

tion is reviewed by che CIA Retirement Board which recommends final actlon

iF the Hend of che Carcor Service aúvises that the employee

does not meet the basic requirements of HR 20-50 for participation, - have

accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement, Board.

This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening

process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in the sys-

tem may be designated participants as soon as possible.

2. In your case, the Head of your Career Service has advised me that

you doinos meet the requirementa of HR 20-50 for designation as a partici-

pant and I have accordingly made the formal determination reguired by chel

regulation that you are not cligible for designacion.

From a review of your

record it appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon

the Enct that you do not have sufficient time prior to completing 15 yeare

of service with the Agency in which you could complete a minimum of 60 months

of qualifying service as required by regulation.

My determination that you

are not eligible at this time for designation in no way affecte your current

status under the Civil Service Retirement System, nor does it preclude recon-

sideration of your eligibility to participate in the CIA System if you should

meet the requirements for designation in the fucure.

you desire further information concerning the requirenents

for designation an a participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that

you read paragraph e of HR 20-50 and paragraph 5 of the Employee Bulletto.

dated 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Law 88-643, The Central Intelligence

Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees."

It is always possible that the records uron which the determination

made in your case nay have been incomplete or inaccurate regarding your actual

employment history wich the Agency. If, after studying the materials cited

above, you have questions regarding the determination that you are not eligta

ble to participate in the CIA Retirement System, please feel free to contact

officials of your Career Service.

They are faniliar wich the detaila of your

case and will gladly discuss them with you.

In addition, you may wish to die-

cuss your case with the CLA Retirement Staff located in Room 6E-1319 Head-

quarters (extension 6001). If such discussions do not resolve any questions

you have regarding your eligibility, you may request that your case be formally

considered by the Board.

However, this request must be made within 30 days of

the date of this menorandum.
