IDENTIFICATION OF PHOTOGRAPHS (Cuban diplomatic in-

stallation)

8. In view of the departure from Mexico of LITAMIL/9,

who in the past has made most LIONION photo identifica-

tions, the Station feels that the bulk of the LIONION

photographs

should perhaps be quickly transmitted to

JMWAVE for review by such assets as AMMUG/1 and AMNIP/1.

As with previous transmittals of LIONION photographs to

Headquarters, the pulse camera films would be processed

only through the negative stage by the Station and

printing would have to be done in PBPRIME.

[HMMA- 26006, 30 April 1965-50-6-122/31

3. It will be recalled that in the last progress report

[see above] the Station requested Headquarters and JMAVE

views on forwarding LIONION photographs to JMWAVE. This

request was promptly answered by HMMW 13645 and photo-

graphs have accordingly been sent to JMWAVE which, by

having AMMUG/1 screen them, has already made one impor-

tant DGI identification.
