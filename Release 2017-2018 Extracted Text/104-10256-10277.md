: German Magazine Attempts to Tie Howard Hunt/

Recent publicity against CIA in the U.S. has stimu-

Frank Heigl, claims to be in touch with "dissident CIA

staffers who were forced out after Dallas."

Heigl sup-

posedly picked up these contacts in Ankara and Frankfurt.

2. In October 1974, Der Stern paid Dallas photographer

Jack Beers $1,000 for copies of pictures he had taken of

persons being led away by the police from the book deposi-

tory after the assassination of President Kennedy.

zine was attempting to identify Watergate defendants Howard

Hunt and Frank Sturgis with persons shown in the Dallas

photographs to build up a story implying

Hunt (and by

inference CIA) involvement

in the assassination.

To buttress

this conjecture,

the magazine hired Professor Rainer Knuss-

mann of

:.the Anthropological Institute of the University of

Hamburg to do a "scientific" comparison of the Dallas photos

with stock shots of Hunt and Sturgis.

His findings are that

there is a high probability that Hunt and Sturgis could be

identical with two persons shown in the Dallas snapshots

and that the matter should be pursued further.

A summary

translation of the Knussmann findings is attached.

SUBJECT:

Personnel Identification "Watergate" (Your reference

Number

FPH/RAD)

Dear Herr Heigl:

I refer to our conversation of 29/10/74 and your written

assignment of 5/11/74 and set forth in the following the

principles of poly-symptomatic resemblance analysis based

on

ANTHROPOLOGICAL IDENTITY EVALUATION

whether the persons, Frank Stergis and Howard Hunt are

identical to persons shown in comparative photographs.

A. Introduction

1. Material

With your letter of 5/11/74 a total -of-47 -

photographs in different formats and differing sharpness were

sent me.

After telephone re-querying with Frau Radizivill*

9 further photos were sent to me.

I have designated the

back sides, lower left, of these 56 shots with green symbols

and with numbers where

different snapshots were in question.

I added small letters in cases where different enlargements

of detail from

the same snapshot were involved.

In the

following report I will refer to these designations of the

photos.

which onlv the introduction and conclusion

were provided. The translation commences

with page 35)

d. Conclusions

The given question about the identity of

Stergis and Hunt with the two designated persons on the

Death

Site (DS) pictures can only be answered clearly to

the extent that a firm identity denial is not possible from

the photographic documentation placed at my disyosal. In

this connection there is a noticeable discrepancy in the

amount of protrusion of the ear in the photos of the man

who could be Hunt which, however,

fails by far to be suf-

ficient for a sure negative identification.

In all, the resemblance analysis with

respect to both persons led to a clear majority of positive

resemblance factors, which above all for Stergis were in

part very convincing.

Since it concerned a clearly estab

lished similiarity in relatively rare distinguishing marks.

Because of the indifferent quality of the source photos

which handicaps a scientific comparison and because of

unsimiliarities which cropped up in the course of the

analysis--though these were nearly all of minor nature

--the total result is not adequate for the establishment

of an absolutely sure identity.

Such a result from photo

materils such as were furnished me is in principle very

diffic..lt to achieve.

The symptoms of identity neverthe-

less are so convincing that it must be advised in any case

that the material be pursued further.

A successful identity

establishment could truly be expected if photos of Stergis

and Hunt, which should be obtainable, were prepared showing

the subjects from the same head angle and under similiar

lighting as in DS photos.

The probable identity from the resemblance analysis

is given a special

weight because the margin of error is

significantly reduced when both Hunt and Stergis are

analyzed in combination.

This is on the common sense ground

that while an accidental resemblance between Stergis or Hunt

on the one

side and one of the persons shown in the DS pictures

would be understandable, there

very narrow probabilit)

that Stergis accidentally resembles

one and Hunt accidentally

the other of both persons shown in the DS photos.

Possibly what is finally expected

of me is a precise

probability quotient for the possible identity of Stergis and

Hunt with:thequestioned persons on the DS:pictures.

However,

the DS photos has a probability of 0.1 (10% error, that is

• 90% for an identity. The similiar

value for Hunt

being

#2 I estimate at 0.3 (that is 30% chance of error

and 70% probability of identity). From this a theoretical

error probability for the combined results figures at only

0.03 (that is 3%, therefore, 97% probability).

In closing I should like to assure you that in prepa-

ration of this evaluation I have taken pains to work according

to the best conscience and knowledge without any political

presumptions.

I hope I have served you with my evaluation

and send you my sincere

respects.

Professor Dr. R. Knussmann
