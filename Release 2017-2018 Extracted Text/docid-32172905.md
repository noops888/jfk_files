INFORMANTS, Cont'a.

AQ 193-C on March 6, 1964, furnished the following

information to SA PAUL I. DORRIS at

Albuquerque, New Mexico:

About two weeks ago EVERETT D. SCHAFER, Pyramid

Commercial Refrigeration Service, 909 Bridge Street SW,

Albuquerque, New Mexico, was heard to relate the following:

About January 10, 1964, EVERETT D. SCHAFER and his

wife, FRANCES SCHAFER, had to go to Beaumont, Texas, in con-

nection with some litigation there. On the way back to

Albuquerque, New Mexico, from Beaumont, Texas, they stopped

at the residence of CARL SCHAFER Or KARL SCHAFER, address

unknown, Dallas, Texas. CARI SCHAFER is EVERETT D. SCHAFER'S

brother. He is an "oll promoter" and a "stock salesman" in

Dallas.: The two brothers were formerly in this business to-

gether in Dallas.

At CARI SCHAFER'& residence while EVERETT D. SCHAFER

was there, also present was a writer from Germany, name unknown,

who is working on the story of Mrs. LEE HARVEY OSWALD, aka.

Marina Oswald. This writer was staying at the residence of

CARL SCHAFER at Dallas. Also present

at the CARL SCHAFER reSi-

dence was the business manager of MIs. LEE HARVEY OSWALD, name

unknown, and an attorney whose first name is TOM, last name

unknown, but whose last name may be HOWARD.

While at this residence, EVERETT D. SCHAFER learned

that the attorney for Mrs. OSWALD and her business manager are

getting a percentage of the money donated to her and that some

effort is being made to disbar Mrs. OSWALD's attorney:

TOM (LNU) Or TOM HOWARD was concerned that other

attorneys would be hired to represent RUBY and that his services

would be discontinued.
