Purpose of this memorandum is to advise that a San Diego

Division extremist informant furnished information resulting in

the solution of a bombing perpetrated by a member of the Secret

Anny Organization (SAO), a white ultraconservative, paramilitary

group clandestinely formed in Arizona in 1971, and the confiscation

•of explosives.

On 6/20/72, 2

J advised that William Francis Yakopec,

a member of the SAO, El Cajon, California, said he personally,

without the knowledge of other SAO members, was responsible for the

6/19/72 bombing of the Guild, a movie theater specializing in

pornographic films, 3827 Fifth Avenue, San Diego, and he identified

four pornography-oriented establishments as potential future bombing

targets. This information was furnished to the Sạn Diego Police

Department (SDPD).

: On 6/25/72, Yakopec told the informant the location of

explosives he had concealed in a vacant lot behind his residence.

This information was also furnished to the SDPD and a search of the

lot resulted in the confiscation of one two-and-one-quarter-pound

block of C-4 military plastic explosives, two one-pound canisters

of primer charges, approximately 30 mechanical caps, andyan unknown

quantity of safety fuses.

19.5

6/26/12, based on information furnished by the source

On InFor577-315-1641

and Yakopec's known involvement in SAO activity, the SDPD executed

search warrants at the home of Yakopec and SAD members George

Mitchell Hoover and Richard Fleury.

The searches produced large

quantities of SAO and Minutemen literature dealing with explosives

and the construction of mines and booby traps, 14 weapons, several

thousand rounds of ammunition, and approximately 50 pounds of

gunpander:

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re: Secret Army Organization

Yakopec and Hoover were arrested and charged with attempted

murder and improper storage of gunpowder in excess

of 20 pounds

without a license. Fleury and his wife, Genevieve, were arrested and

charged with improper storage of gunpowder in excess of 20 pounds.

All four subjects are currently incarcerated in the San Diego County

Jail.

The source has expressed willingness to testify in this

matter if necessary to secure prosecutive action. The SDPD has

stated should the source's testimony become necessary steps would be

taken by that Department to insure protection of the source and his

family and that they would be relocated and suitable employment

obtained for the source.

Inasmuch as the preliminary facts regarding the bombing of

the Guild Theater failed to indicate involvement of members of a

terrorist or revolutionary group, under existing guidelines the

incident was one within the primary jurisdiction of the Alcohol,

Tobacco and Firearms Division and that agency was immediately

advised.

Pertinent portions of this information will be furnished

tó the Internal Security Division of the Department of Justice and

to Secret Service.

MOSCO?

The July 25, 1972, Issue of the San Diego Unlon,

a dally newspaper, contained an article regarding a probe of

the Secret Army Organization (SAO) by the San Diego Police

Department. A portion of this article reported that on July

21, 1972, San Diego police had

searched the residence of Mrs.

Vahl Boyles, 4443 Upland Street, La Mesa, California. Off1-

cers reportedly found a quantity of drugs

and medical supples,

explosive paraphernalla and Minutemen literature buried under

the house. No arrests were made.

The SAO Is an anticommunist, paramilltary

organization formed in 1971

in San Diego,

California. It intends to conduct intelli-

gence-type operations and to offer training

in urban guerrilla warfare to be used against

"left-wing groups"

and suspected enemies of

the United States..

On August 22, 1972, it was determined through

California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (CLETS)

that Vahl Alderman Boyle, 4443 Upland Street, La Mesa,

California, has Callfornia Driver's Llcense F0435561.

on August 11, 1972, and again on September 21,

1972, records of

the San Diego Police Department and the

San Diego County Sheriff's Office contained no arrest

record for the subject.

On September 28, 1972, the FBI Identification

DIvision advised that no record

for the subject could be

located by that Division.

On August 17, 1972, records of the Merchants

Credit Association,

San Diego, disclosed that subject was

married to Theodore

Ja Boyle,

and had formerly resided at

3865 Caraneha Street, Lemon Grove, and 8033 Nazer Street,

Lemon Grove, California.

Her employment was shown as real

estate sales and employment for Theodore J. Boyle shown as

VIce President of Business Forms.

On September 21, 1972, Sergeant Jack R. Pearson,

dence telephone 469-1129, with the intention of making

appointment for interview. Mrs. BOYIE stated that her

personal affairs were keeping her busy and she did not know

when she would be available for interview. She further

advised that she did not desire to be Interviewed by two

Agents of the FBI as she

became nervous under these circum-

stances.

She said she would prefer to be interviewed oy a

lone Agent, reserving the right to have a witness of her own

present during the interview. She added that she would be

glad to answer any questions over the telephone.

When questioned regarding material found at her

residence during a search conducted by the San Diego Police

Department Mrs. BOYLES stated that most of the material

located by the Police Department had been the property of

her son, Troy Harold Haughton, which material had been left

there by him prior to his disappearnce in 1967. She con-

tinued that charts,

signs, maps, medical supplies and

blasting materials

nad been

the property of IROY. - She said

that two rifles and a quanlity of ammunition taken by the

Police Department had been her personal property for which

she had receipts and which had subsequently been returned

to her

by the Police Department.

.

Mrs. BOYLE continued that she was well aware that

her son TROY had been a leader cf the Minutemen Organization

In San Diego, but said that she herself was not very fanillar

with this organization.

She said that the last contact she

had had with TROY had been a telephone call duing approxi-

mately April, 1967, while she had been in Europe on a vaca

tion.

At that time TROY had told her that he was going

to

get out of the Minutemen organization and had told her that

he was worried about what the Minutemen leaders would do

when he told them he wanted to leave the organization.

leader of

the Secret Army Organization

as SAM DAVIS, advised that the SAO is now "dead" as far as

San Diego is concerned.

(SD I-1, October 8, 1972)

During late October, 1972, JERRY LYNN DAVIS statca

that because of court proceedings against SAO members

san Diego, California, the SAO has become a defunct

organization.

A small pocket of SÀO members continue to

exist in Los

Angeles, California, and two members remain

in the Seattle, washington, area.

The unaffected elements

may possibly band together

but under a different label.

(SD I-1, October 27, 1972)

On January 16, 1973, JERRY LYNN DAVIS was interviewed

by Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)

at San Diego, California.

He advised that the sa0 is now

no longer active because of the arrests of members in

Diego and because of the demoralizing effect of

learning

that HOWARD BARRY GODFREY was reporting to the

FbI concerning

the activities of the SAO and its members. He said San Diego

had been the headquarters of the SAO.

Both the National

Headquarters and the San Diego Unit of the SAO have ceased

to exist.

The only remaining group of SAO members might

possibly be a small group operating independently in

Los Angeles, California, under a leader who Davis would

not identify.

DAVIS said he is completely disenchanted with

right-wing activity and

will no

longer participate in such

activity.

He intends to cooperate lully with law enforcement

agencies.

He complained that when he was arrested recchtly,

only one or two of his "right-wing friends" stood by him.

He intends to move out of the state of California and live

in Mississippi where he has relatives.

AT PHOENIX, ARIZONA

The state coordinator of SAO activity at Phoenix,

Arizona, has been instructed to include the state oi New

Mexico in recruiting efforts for the SAO.

(SD T-I, May 10, 1972)

In Arizona the SAO has mailed a considerable

amount of literature pertaining to

thinking people, but has not at this time received response

fxom the type of people they wish to affiliate. Consequently,

no formal chapter or nucleus around which to organize has

been formed in Arizona.

However, a coordinator has been

named and is operating. Not all former Minutemen will be

accepted into the SAO.

The SAO foresees a decentralized type of operation

in each state, where in a revolutionary situation brought

about by treasonous conmunist elements, the SAo could

present a militant front immediately.

Recent bulletin

material from SAO Headquarters

in San

Diego has introduced

the thought that "the basic battle facing our country

today is the one between individualism and collectivism.

In its political

form it appears as personal freedom versus

police-state regimentation.....In times of emergency, our

members

are not going

to depend on General Headquarters

for training material, bulletins and printed propaganda

items.

Iocal units and often the lone individual will

have to improvise all these things.

Communications to

and from higner commands may be uncertain and the transmission

of organization orders may be slow.

We must have poopie

who think for themselves.

Equally important, we must

have people who can see what needs to be done and get at

it without being told."

Here is one last bit of infomation. The New Christian CruBade

people are very concerned about the imprisonment of George Hoover ci

the Secret Army Organization. At one of their banquets the NCC had

four unoccupied places set at the table which were in honor of four

men whom they hold to be absent heroes. These four men were Joe hiccar

George Hoover, Charles Lindbergh and a man named R. Miles.

Anyway, it has been learned that a man whom Tom Metzger knows

1s going to take a dossier of the Hoover case to some congressran

in Washington, D.C. who is part of a committee currently scheduled

to investigate the FBI. The dossier consists of newspaper clippings

and other material pertaining to Hoover's activities in the SAO, his

arrest, conviction, appeal, etc. They are hoping to stir up a big

publicity stink to give the FBI a bad name due to Barry Godfrey's

activities and in so doing hope to effect an eventual release of Hoove:

his correct name. For some reason they all call him Mickey Hoover.

• That is about all for now. I hope this will be of some help

to you.

EXTREMIST INFORMAN?'

TAie

This is to'advise of information developed by captioned

informant disclosing a shooting incident arising from activities

l of the newly organized white extremist Secret Army Organization.

By memorandum dated 1/11/72, you were advised of the

formation and activities of the newly formed ultraconservative

white extremist paramilitary group known as Secret Army Organiza-

tion (SAO).

S40 has targeted for harassment San Diego State

College Professor Peter Bohmer.

Bohmer's residence is a well-lnown

New Left conmune, whose occupants, along with Bohmer,

are planning

demonstrations at the Republican National Convention scheduled

I San Diego for August, 1972.

Captioned informant, a 28-year-old white male operated

since August, 1967, has been recently targeted to penetrate the

extremist-oriented

SAO. On January 6, 1972, informant was

requested by SAO leader to surveil. Bohmer's

residence in order

obtain intelligence information. Accompanying informant on

surveillance was SAO associate George M. Hoover. The surveillance,

held during the evening of January 6, 1972, was discontinued after

the Bohmer residence appeared unoccupied.

However, prior to

discontinuance, an SAO sticker was left at the front door. While

passing in front of the house in informant's automobile, Hoover,

without warning and to the complete dismay of informant, fired

two shots into the house. The informant strongly protested and

they sped away. A female occupant of the house reportedly

sustained minor gunshot wound in her elbow.

134-17222

Informant furnished details of the shooting, which

would not have been available through any other source, and

cautioned that Hoover is "fired up" over the incident and ready

for a violent confrontation should police approach him on this

matter. Identities of those involved in shooting not known to

San Diego police; however, witnesses did furnish description of

informant's automobile.

This informant, during his utilization, has furnished

exceptionally valuable information on the Minutemen and has been

completely reliable. He has

been previously cautioned, as all

extremist informants are, not to become directly involved in

violent confrontations or activities. He is the only Bureau

source covering the violence-prone SAO. San Diego has

advised

that pertinent information developed by informant will

be

furnished to the San Diego Police Department but informant's

identity withheld unless disclosure bacomes necessary.

There

appears to be no objection to this, and San Diego will be

instructed to closely follow this matter and promptly report

pertinent developments.

RECOMMENDATION:

That attached teletype

in accordance with above be

approved and sent.

brownfield to Junkins Memo

RE: LAURITZ P. MILLER

of the San Diego Office August 10, 1967, while employed as

an equipment-checker for Pacific Telephone and telegraph

Company, San Diego, California.

A gun hobbyist, Army trained

in the use of explosives, he became associated

with the top

echelon of the Minutemen as well as the Secret Army Organization

(SAO), furnishing excellent information to the FBI regarding

these and other extremist, groups.

By communication dated November 20, 1972, the

San Diego Office discontinued Godfrey as an informant. Godfrey

had testified

of George Mitchell Hoover, SAO member charged with attempted

murder, and in the trial of William Francis Yakopec, who was

found guilty of the bombing of the Guild Theater in San Diego.

At that time, Godfrey also was scheduled to testify against

Jerry Lynn Davis, SAO leader charged with illegal possession

of explosives.

SA Petersen also testified in Hoover's trial and

had been Godfrey's contacting Agent.

As a result of Godfrey's appearances as a prosecution

witness, his identity as an FBI informant was publicized in the

news media. (137-17222, 157-17513-10)

Regarding Miller:

Our files show that by letter dated November 30,

1971, Miller requested information regarding crimes committed

by juvenile females. He was furnished a Uniform Crime Reports

Bulletin.

Miller wrote to Acting Director Gray August 11,

1972, furnishing information regarding what he considered

to be a world-wide communist conspiracy for revolution,

including direct communication between u. s. revolutionaries

and the Japanesa. Miller stated that some American servicemen

were sympathetic with the world revolutionaries and were being

used as couriers. Miller explained he had develóped this

information while doing research in Japan.

He requested

information as to whether the FBI knew of

the "situation."

By airtel August 21, 1972, the Los Angeles Office

was advised of Miller's August llth letter and was instructed

to intervie him.

The Los Angeles Office further was instructed

to advise Miller of the confidential nature of information contained

in Bureau filas and to alert him regarding the jurisdictions oi

the respective military services over their personnel.

It has been ascertained that at this time Run

Inot interested in trying to form or lead any type of security force

or any right ving extremist group. When asked by James K. Yarner

I Ios Angeles (via Dennis Loso of Escondido) if he rould do his,

day stated that he would like to see the formation of a Security

lorce with teeth in it but does not consider himsell to bè enough

Wnile declining to lead a Security Force, Eddy did say that

the only way to stop FBI infiltration of rightist groups would be

'or one of the infiltrators to "vind up in the river" soneday. Eday

Lo positive that Ion Knight's San Diego unit of the Nazi Party has

regular FBI infiltrator. The only three men of whom he is not sus

picious are lackey waheficld, Ray. Wilson and Gerald Smith. Said Eddy,

"Those three men dropped out of the thing and so I ligure they're okay

but you can bet that the fins is still in there pushing".

Ioso said that the whereabouts of people like Barry Godirey

should be learned and they snould be telephoned and intimidated.

Bady said he thinks such intimidationg would be a waste of time and

that people like Godfrey should be killed.

kickey Wakefield of Say

Marcos went along with iddy's suggestion. Ron Eddy also mentioned

haring had an encounter with an fBI agent named Peterson in San Diego

but did not elaborate.

Eddy firmly believes that any man who connits hirself to one

organisation in the far Right should not be involved with others.

He says he vould be very suspicious of anzone tiho is. He 1s 3150

somewhat suspicious of lom Inight. He says that Joe Brinker save

the FBI interviered the man. 'Also, Eddy wonders how knight saved

his federal job in the face of his continued Nazi activities.. Eady

Ieels that arr regular rightist extremist wio stays on with the lazi

Here is one last

bit of infornation. The New Christian Crusade

people are very concerned about the imprisonment of George Hoover of

the Secret Army Organization. At one of their banquets the iCC had

four unoccupied places set at the table which were in honor of four

men whom they hold to be absent heroes. These four men were Joe McCart:

George Hoover, Charles Lindbergh and a man named R. Miles.

Anyway, it has been learned that a man whom fom Metzger knows

is going to take a dossier of the Hoover case to some congressman

In Washington, D.C. who is part of a committee currently scheduled

to investigate the FBI. The dossier consists of newspaper clippings

and other material pertaining to Hoover's activities in the SAO, his

arrest, conviction, appeal, etc. They are hoping to stir up a big

publicity stins to give the FBI a bad name due to Barry Godfrey's

setivities and in so doing hope to effect an eventual release of Hoover

Irom prison. By the way, the MCC people do not refer to Hoover by.

his correct name. For some reason they all call him Mickey Hoover.

That is about all for now. I hope this will be of sone help

REPORT BY JERONE

On August 7, 1970

.....

Yesterday, August 6, 1970, I went to watch

,the liational Yiovie Day at Disneyland. Many long hairs

and hippie type people were at the gate and parking lot

all day long but there were

never enough those at one

time to make a big croud and most left after milling

around for a nhile.

It appeared that they just did not

have enough ironey to get in..

FRANK YACOPIC, JERRY TARTAGLIO and others got

in using Press Cards from the Anaheim Bulletin. Also unere

WaS ZUGIE BROWN from the Orange County Hue Press,, STEVE

FRANKS ITOR VIVA

and many other rignt wingers fron the

Orange county area. The group ten several hundred photo-

gra is and shot two rolls of movie films.

The only serious incident occurred at about

6:30 pom., when 500 or 400 yippies got together and started

marching from place to place in Disneyland. There weze

several scuffles with the police who were called in at

about 7:00 p.n., and one girl

was yelling "Kill the Pig,

Kill the Pig.

The yippies made an attempt to tear down the

flag in the fort out JEPRY TARTAGLIO and "CHUCK" stood

against the flag pole and stopped them.

one ai the apparent leaders

of the yippies was

about 45 years old with long hair and beaas.

He got into

a scuffle with the police and a cop grabbed

him by the

hair, which caine right off showing hin to be very bald.

It looked to me as if there would have been

serious trouble if the yippies had been able to get a few

more people in there.

However, they backed sight down

when they were confronted by the police. A lot of threats

were made and obscenity used.

During the day I noted about six yippies in front

of the gate with 15 - 20 ticket books passing out tickets

to other yippies to get in. Someone put out a lot of

money foi a lot of yippies

to get in.

It has been learned that with the help of BARRY

GODFREY, BILL CLAY moved last Friday, June 5, to his new

apartment at 4113 Ingraham, San Diego. This

is supposed

to be Ingraham Villa.

No one is supposed to know about this

address.

CLAY had a

large quantity of personal belongings

and junk to move and has rented a garage near Second and

Ivy (between Ivy and Juniper on the east side of Second

there is a row of four garages and CLAY has the second from

the left) where he is storing some of this stuff.

oLy It was also learned that GEORGE HOOVER waS at BILI

CALY'S new apartment Friday evening and was in a talkative

mood as he was dead drunk. HOOVER apparently works at the

same place as SAll DAVIS. HOOVER Said DAVIS was recently

in Texas on vacation and coming back his automobile broke

down at Gila Bend, Arizona, and HOOVERlad to go out there to

assist him. Their boss at the fence company, is also supposed

to be a Minutemen and HOOVER and DAVIS are probably getting

some of their explosives from the fence company.

HOOVER now uses a .45 Automatic Pistol which he even

takes to bed with him. He claimed his boss recently put

up $400 to get him out of some legal trouble.

HOOVER Said he had been living with a girl (NFI)

who in the recent past, had walked out on him and had said

she was going to contact the FBI. HOOVER seemed to be

worried about this.

HOOVER was getting more drunk all the time and

began rambling about "the ranch" where he lives. He said he

had just moved out of the hotel into one of the smaller

houses on te ranch.

He kept talking about his horse and

asked CLAY to call

"WILLIE" at the ranch and ask him to feed

the horse.

I was talking to BILL CLAY lust Saturday.

He seemed agitated and said he had neoder to use a

(MM) leader

and that he wanted

this done to attract Federal

attention in order to protect somerne else in the

background.

He is still talking about a new Right Wing

organization and claimed to have contacts with groups

in 11 western states and said these people are trying

to establish a communications network and said the

name American Resistance Movement (ARM) had been

selected for this organization.

CIAY got to talking about DE PUGH and said he

had been aware ot DE PUGH's whereabauts when he was in

hiding.

He said he now has reason to believe TROY HOUGHTON

may still be alive and probably connected with ArM.

He

said he believes HOUGHTON may have wanted out of the MiM

organization, for some reason, and had to disappear to do so.

CLAY also talked about setting up a meeting with

the Leftist student group at University of California at

San Diego during the regular week and he would like himself,

BARRY GODFREY, SAM DAVIS, and GEORGE HCOVER to meet with

four students

from that group.

I have learned that HOOVER always carries a

savage .380 pistol when he is away from home.

DAVIS

usually camies a 300 or 32 automatic pistol, CLAY

usually has a.

22 automatic pistol, FRANK YACOPEC always

ras a .32 MAB,

"The Judge" (JERRY BUSH) usually has a

• 380 automatic pistol, and PETER RUPLINGIR carries a

Today, I went to a meeting at the Greek

State College to find out about the march route

for the anti-var demonstration to ba held tomorrow.

There were about 60 people in attendance at the meeting

which started about 3:00 Pil.

These included BILL COATS,

ALAN ST/CLIFT, FREITJOF, THYGESON, GARY GULLEY, JACKQUELYNE

TU BURG, and a

reverend from the Wesleyan Foundation.

There was a big hassle about the choice or tha

march route; the cric wanted to march Irom Horton Plaza in

downtown San Diego, along Broadway

to the 1lth Naval District:

Headguarters for some speeches and then to the old ferry

landing for a rally.

SMs and the other students voted this down and

CMC almost walked out. A long debate followed resulting

considerable uneasiness between CMC and SPIC. ALAN STANCLIFE

was selected as monitor captain.

Afterwards, I went with BILL CLAY to Grossmont

College where another anti-var rally was taking place and

picked up some leaflets, which are attached.

We noted that they were passing out free food.

BILI CLAY went and got some syringes and FRAUK YACOPEC

bought some pickles which wero injected with rubbing

alcohol and castor oil and were passed out to the students

Who were seen eating them. It is not noted if any of

them became 111.

FRANK YACOPEC set fire to a trash can in a rest-

room to cause a little extra excitement.

After this, we

‚arove by the People's Commune and saw three male individuals

wearing Army helmets.

KOMINSKY is an order man, 60-70 years of age,

blue eyes. He weights 160-170 pounds, has poor

posture, is he slouches and has a pot belly.

From his

statements,

I gathered that he is very much in favor of

what the San Diego Street Journal is doing. He said he

gave all his records to ine street Journal

and claimed

that it took 5 Street Journal starf members 8 hours to

copy his notes of the san diego area alone. He claimed

he had much more information on Right Wing activities

in America and claimed he has spent five years researching

information for his new book which will be called "Count

Down, USA.

He said the first volume of this book which

will be an expose on fascism in the United States, will

be 800 pages long and the second volume will be 1300 pages

long.

He seemed to be pleased to talk about his work and

as we reported ourselves to be fans of the street Journals

opposed to fascism, he talked quite freely.

He told us of contacts he has in the San Diegn

Police Department, of the san Diego District Attorney's

Office, and also claimed to have a source of information

San Diego FBI Office.

KOMINSKY said he formerly had high pleced friends

in Government and claimed he had been visited at his home.

in Elsinore by Presidents of the

He said he had worked at Hollywood as a bit player.

He claimed that when he worked for the FBI

They have photographs which they claim

were taken of people at Communes in the Northern

California area wearing. fatigues and practicing with

rifles.

They will try to locate these communes

and conduct terrorist activities against them.

It was also learned that DAVIS attended a

recent gun show at El Paso, Texas. He reportedly said

he would put GODFREY in touch with his suppliers, who

can get anything in the way of weapons, ammunition

and

explosives and other articles when

he leaves.

Apparently DAVIS and HOOVER will out this

plan into effect during the first part of 1971.

San Diego State College, has been more active lately.

He has been Involved in trying to organize some sit-

Attached is an SMC leaflet which I recently

picked up at SDSC.

It appears that GEORGE HOOVER and SAM DAVIS

are bosom buddies.

They invited me to go to the Gunsmoke

Ranch in Harbison Canyon last Sunday.

They were both

there and I also met ROGER WILLIS.

In addition there

were three women and two other males at the ranch whose

names I did not learn.

DAVIS was In Mississippi recently and at the

ranch he was driving a green Chevrolet van with Mississippi

license F/61,2030.

He apparently broke down somewheres

in Texas one the way back and HOOVER went to rescue him.

On the ranch there 1s a pistol range.

and a

range with piano

Saples up and running targets but that

part was burned down in a recent fire.

The range is

being rebuilt.

There are also two muzzle loading cannons

on the ranch and there is a bunker or open mine shaft

type of thing in the side of ahill. I could see shoring

and supports inside but was not allowed to get close enough

•to see what it was.

-

HOODR and DAVIS were practicing quick-draw

shooting and hip shooting and are supposedly good

shots with a .45 caliber automatic pistol.

They are

always armed

at least with .22 caliber derringer pistol.

SAM DAVIS has many M-2 carbine parts which he

w1ll sell at a good price.

He gets alot of his stuff

from a place in Los Angeles, and he has approached BERRY GODFREY

asking him to stop at that place the next time he

1s in

Los Angeles and obtain some hand grenade casings. The casings

are apparently being sold for $1.00 a pise.

I learned that the house HOOVER lived in on the

ranch was

burned In the fire.

I also

learned that

there are two fellows named STAN (INU) and DAVE (LNU)

who live on the ranch.

While I was there SAM was thiring about staging a

punitive raid on the SDPD In retaliation for the arrest of

ISSAC CANTRELL.

He said however he did not know CANTRELL.

DAVIS sald he feels that the FBI and SDPD

are communist controled and he wants to neutralize

them.

In particular DAVIS has a special hate for

Agent O'BRIEN of the FBI. He said he knows that most

of the Agents are decent people who are just doing

their job.

However he feels that O BRIEN is

persecuting the Minutemen as a vengeance and said he

would give anything to get O'BRIEN's home address

and telephone number.

DAVIS said he was going to price some tear

gas grenades and said he could get primacora in 500 feet

lengths for $30.00.

It was learned that the SMC anti-war march

11/1/70 was a complete fallure. There were only 150 - 200

people who participated in the

march, with a few more

attending the rally.

Nothing of interest happened

and the speeches given were dull and uninteresting.

For some reason he was quite upset and was taking

about making plans for a tactical squad of six or so individuals

with which to harness and terrorize left wing sympathizers in

He said he wanted to have a meting this

-In

particular, he seems to want to conduct a raid on MELVIN CRANE'S

ranch. He said he would shoot the Doberman Pincers CRANE has

guarding the place, ransack the hoise then burn it down.

He was also talking about another place in Harbison

canyon, I will try to get the address later, where he claims

Communist Party meetings are being hela.

Among others, he clains

that SI CASADY and DOROTHY HEALEY (phonetic) have ceen meeting

there.

He says he wants to raid that place too.

He was also talking about a 'Doc Roberts" who he says

has many weapons contacts and who may have access to machine

guns and hand grenades. He may put me in touch with this person

later on.

• I have also been talking to FRANK YACOPEC: YACOPEC

says he has learned of a possible existence of some bunkers

which were buried and abandoned by General PATTON at the start

of the secona riorld war.

Fie says the bunkers are supposed to

still be full of ammunition and explosives.

He claimed he

was told of the existence of the bunkers by a former aide of

General PATTON. He told me that he, BILL CLAY and BARRY. GODFREY

may fly up to the location at a later date and look it over.

Apparently these bunkers are located somewhere in the desert

east of 29 Palms.

I was also in touch with PETER RUPLINGER on Saturday.

He stated he has obtained 50 hand grenade fuses and wants to

go to Los Angeles to buy 50 hand grenade casings anâ he will

then activate the hand grenades. FETER claimed he has a friend

have had regarding setting up a Civil War Confederate

skirmish group similar to other such groups which have

been established In other parts of the country. This

group. will be set up by HOOVER, DAVIS, STAN MoDADE, (INU)

MARTINI of the Accuracy Gun Shop, FRANK YACOPEC and BARRY

GODFREY. It is expected as many as 50 or 60 other individuals

may join the slarmish group, some who will be rightwing

oriented people and may who will be just plain gun nuts.

These will include JERRY GEIER, ROGER WILLIS and others

probably including some from the Patch and Ball Gun Shop

crowd.

I have also learned that GEORGE HOOVER and SAM

DAVIS have three operational Civil War field artillery

pieces which are located on ROGER WIIIIS! Gunsmoke Ranch

property in Harbison Canyon and may actually belong to

him. STAN MCDADE Is building a 4th artillery piece. He

has the gun carriage assembly and has ordered the barrel

for the weapon..

According to HOOVER, the beauty of organizing

such a skirmish group is that 1t will allow the right

wingers and Minutemen to use the group as an above ground

organization and to openly drill and train with weapons.

Members would have their own uniforms and the organization

would be set up in a military fashion with officers, ranks,

etc., assigned to the members. Persons joining the

organization wili be protected from police and other

outside harassment by being assigned the name of an actual

CIvil War officer or

soldier to use while they are participating

• In the organization's activities. The existence of the

organization will also give the right wingers an excuse to

have large quantities of black powder and percussion caps

• on hand to use for their weapons.

In addition the organization could be used to

provide an honor guard to be present at local appearances

of right wing speakers and to set up counter-demonstrations

against left wing activities.

This skirmish group would be controlled and direct-

ed by an underground nucleus of 6 or 8 solid Minutemen members

who are not generally known to other members of the skirmish

group.

HOOVER and DAVIS are apparently becoming less

wing activltles. According to them, he is too busy now

adays with his own personal affairs to be of much use.

For this reason, they have said they don't want him in the

underground group of Minuteman members who will direct

the Civil War skirmish.

It has come to my attention that JERRY BUSCH

has fallen out of favor with most of the Minutemen members

who do not like or trust him. SAM JAVIS has even threatened

to shoot him. GEORGE HOOVER still Ilkes him though and

BUSCH spends most of his weekends at the Gunsmoke Ranch with

HOOVER and WILLIS. Could their be a romance brewing?

Sunday evening meeting.

Following this the microphone was opened to

the audience but only one individual, a young male

Individual with long hair and wearing no shit or shoes,

took advantage of the opportunity.

He spoke against

carrying the Viet Cong flag and against trying

• to destroy

the system saying he believed the necessary changes

could te made within the established frame work. He

was not too well received..

Source also acquired a leaflet distributed by

members of the Student Mobilization Committee (SiC) at

the University of California at San Diego (UCSD).

The

leaflet called for a massive demonstration against the

local draft board office on Park Boulevard and

starting

with a "mass-in"

at the local board building at 10:00 a.m.,

on 2/16/71.

The leaflet indicated that persons interested

In participating should assemble in the Urey Hall parking

'Iot at UCSD at 9:15 a.M., On 2/16/71. Other persons

desiring to attend should find their own transportation.

For further information interested persons were requested

to call telephone number 453-3362.

the signatures of enough people so that during the period

2/16/71 - 2/19/71, 20 persons per hour could be assigned

to be present at the draft board for harassment purposes.

: The leaflet indicated that there are many legal

forms of harassment which should be engaged in such as

bringing any kind of garbage or miscellaneous articles

to be filed in a registrant's folder as Selective Service

law states that a registrant may place anything in his

folder which he feels is pertinent to his draft status.

tie up the system.

It pointed out that females by

In that area and ne has been so in charge since the

on the suoject of TRoy hOuGhtoN,

• I have learned

_from both DAVIS and BILL CLAY that HOUGHTON's contacts

may have been much more widely spread than I thought.

Specifically, they told me that HOUGHTON was behind an

attempt several years ago by 18 "hunters" in the State

of New York to conduct sabotage and terrorist attacks

on New Left Groups.

These 18 individuals were supposedly

arrested and a large quantity of weapons and ammunition

was confiscated.

I also talked some more with DAVIS about TOM

FORREST and it appears that they know each other extremely

well.

DAVIS said he had some business dealings with

FORRESI involving some machine guns and othes items.

DAVIS apparently has decided not to get rid

of as much of his explosives and so forth as

he originally

said. He has a small quantity of I.N.I. and

also some

C4 Plastic explosives which he will sell at $10 a pound

which is too high a price.

He said he can also obtain a military weapon

which is like a bazooka and has a self-contained 3.5"

rocket sound in an expendable launcher. He said the price

of this is $25.

I was talking with BARRY GODFREY last night.

He

said he had just spent sometime with SAM DAVIS the same

evering and that DAVIS admitted to being a total anarchist.

He said that DAVIS thinks that the U.s. government is as

much an enemy of the people, meaning right wing conservatives

as the left wing movement is. He said DAVIS is still Interested

In attempting to formulate a new organization to take the

place of the old Minuteman Group. BARRY said DAVIS wants

to set up 2 right wing groups, one, an open group which

would corduct intelligence type operations and the other a

covert group which would conduct sabotage and harassment

and obtain such things as explosives and machine guns..".

GODFREY said the conversation with DAVIS got

around to TROY HOUGHTON and DAVIS said he has known for

two years what actually happened to HOUGHTON and added that

• BETTY HOUGHTON has also had the same information. According

to DAVIS, a meeting was held at which BETTY HOUGHTON, DAVIS,

PAUL HUNT, DENNIS MOWER, GEORGE HOOVER, and one other unidentified

Individual were present. The meeting was held for the purpose

of hearing an oral report from MARY TOLLERTON as to what had

happened to TROY HOUGHTON, that he had been held prisoner of .

HOUGHTON was then poisoned to death and his

body disposed of somewhere in the State of Missourl. After

the meeting, BETTY HOUGHTON was in favor of making all this

information public and requesting a grand jury Investigation

Of DE PUGH and PEYSON for her husband's death. However, the

other people present at the meeting talked her out of this

close of action.

GODFREY then said DAVIS told him that he knows of a

total of five people who were killed by de pugh, including

TROY HOUGHTON. He said two of these were killed after

HOUGHTON's death to keep his murder quiet. DAVIS said that

MARY TOLLERTON was being hidden in the Los Angeles area for

quite a while by DENNIS MOWER, PAUL HUNI and others as there

was thought DE PUGH was looking for her to kill her. Some row,

she got away from MOWER and HUNT for a period of about six months

but then they got her back again. Allegedly, BETTY HOUGHTON

told MOWER to keep track of MARY TOLIERTON at all cost even

If he had to marry hex..

According to DAVIS, It Is his bellef HOUGHTON was

killed by DE PUGH as DE PUGH thought. HOUGHTON had already

contacted the FBI or was in the process of arranging such a

contact for the purpose of Informing on DE PUGH's activities.

REPORT BY JEROME

I was in contact with SAM DAVIS this morning.

He finally got his wish and was fired from his job.

did not go to work as he was supposed to this morning

and while I was at his house his boss called saying that

he had some important jobs for DavIs to take care of.

said it DAVIs could not be more reliable, ne, the boss.

would have to find someone else to do the 100. davI

then told him to go ahead and find someone else whereupon

his boss hung up.

to in the middle of next week for one ROGER (INU).

DAVIS said he has another job to inte

job will last approximately one month following which

DAVIS will be laid off and then can claim unemployuent

and welfare while devoting full time to his activities.

He believes he can draw unemployment for a period of

approximately six months.

He talked again about the explo-

sives and other materials which he has and some of which he

has given to me.

He said he has come across opportunities to buy

other

such materials at lalrly low cost ana.

therefore,

wants to sell some of the stuff he now has to get money to

buy these other materials and also to help the Mazi Party

out financially.

DAVIS stated that it is his intention to join .

the American Nazi

Party and showed me his membership

application form.

It is my understanding that the local nazi

group which has,

in the past, been part of the National Socialist

White Peoples Farty (NSPP), will switch allegiance in the

near future to the Bishop Faction of the American Nazi

Party now headed up by SCOTT WINCHESTER at Los Angeles,

California.

It and when this takes place, the name they

apparently will use for the new group is American socialisi

Workers Party.

DAVIS is all excited about buying uniforms

and other things to get ready to go on "stoim trooper"

duty. He said he is going to try and get all of his

associates, including GEORGE HOOVER, SIAN MIC DADE, JAMEN

POTO, BARRY GODFREY, ROGER HILLIS and "AL" (INU) to joir

also.

1N 53163 Do01d:32989585 Page 142

## Page 143

According to DAVIS, the Nazi Party group which he

has been hearing so much about lately is only a segment of

the total Nazi group in the San Diego area.

GERALD I. K.

SMITH

the leader of this active group, is apparently only

that is called a section leader.

There are apparently

several sections of the Nazi Party group in San Diego

and overall leader for the whole group.

DAVIS said that he and three other people,

of whom will probably be STAN MC DADE and the other two

members of the NSWPP in San Diego, will go to Los Angeles

sOOn

to see SCOTT WINCHESTER and make arrangements for

merging with his group.

DAVIS says that the Nazi Party group is good

organizing but poor on weapons

acquisition and intelligence

work.

He said he expects to be of considerable help to the

Nazis in these two areas.

He said he has been in contact with BARRY GODFREY

and had asked him to do

some work on compiling a list of

liberal members of the Jewish community in San Diego as

a starting point for harassment and other tactics by the

Nazis.

He said that the Nazis have been using DON SISCO'S

Militants Formulary as a handbook for training. in explosives

He saià SISCO himself is reported to be a section

leader for either the Bishop Faction of the Nazi Party. or

the NSWPP.

DAVIS: telephone number is listed in the directory

under B. I. GIBSON at 2393 Washington, Lemon Grove, California.

The telephone number is 465-9572.

DAVIS indicated that he has been offered 100

grenade bodies with the necessary parts to make live

weapons frow them for a sum of $25.00.

This morning I observed all the parts of a dis-

assembled .30 caliber Browning air-cooled machine gun in

the back room of the Bullseye Gun Shop.

I was In contact with SAM DAVIS again yesterday

and

3 he mentioned again his favorite project which is-to

f111 some rifle grenades with thermite and explosives and

to fire them onto the top of several gasoline and oil

storage tanks, among those which are located in MIssion

Valley near the Intersection of Murphy Canyon Road and

Firars Road. He said he belleves the results will be

spectular and that he will not permanently léave the

San Diego area without completing this project. •

DAVIS continues to be extremely interested In the

local Nazi Party group and sald he wants to work for a

high position In this organization. He says that VIC WALTON

'Is deeply Involved In the NSWPP, but even though, he still

does not trust WALTON. He said he Is going ahead with plans

• to locate and rent office space for the NSWPP and also set

up a printing press for that group.

• DAVIS also talked about another plan which is

being worked on to attempt to seize a Viet Cong flag which is

hanging In an office at UCSD. He sald at least he would llke

tonine

HH 55163 DooId:32989585 Page 141

## Page 145

to make an effort to put a smoke grenade through the

window of this office. He said he has been talking with

the NSWPP about taking 15 members of that group along

to protect. the person who would fire this rifle grenade

through the window. He sald the results would be better

yet if a high explosive grenade was used. He advised that

the NSWPP and others he Is assoclated with are suppose to

have some IAWs (Ilght AntI-tank Weapons) which they might

use.

FRANK YACOPEC has been fired again. He now

has a boarder living with him who was recently discharged

from the MarIne Corps. This individual is named ROBERT S.

MAYER.

He claims to be well acquainted with the firearm

ranges at Camp. Pendleton and knows of an ammo dump there

which he says has only one

guard who could easily be

over-powered, and that, by using a two ton truck, It would

be possible to. take over a million rounds of ammo from this

location. MAYER also claims to have a .45 callber Thompson

sub-machine gun, and M-16 and M-14 rifles which he would

sell.

BILI GUIETTE, who runs the Bulleye Gun Store was

set up in that business by his

father who Is a Sergeant with

the San Diego Police Department. GUIETTE was telling me

today that he was at RON ZARICK's house a few days ago and

saw there pany parts for vardous machine suns.

and while there, saw a M-14 rifle, a water-cooled •30

callber machine gun and a BAR.

DAVIS claims that he is somewhat upset with

BARRY GODFREY, as he gave GODFREY an assignment to watch

the San Diego FBI Office to obtain Information regarding

the activities of the local FBI. DAVIS said he might

uSe GEORGE HOOVER to stake out, the FBI Office If he Is

presently out of work on'a fake back injury. The disabllity

chits and this fake Injury were signed by Dr. DUNKLEY

In El Cajon, who has agreed to take care of any MM or other

right wing Individual wounded in a confrontation the Left

or with law enforcement agencies without filing the

necessary reports and without charging a fee. HOOVER 1S

suppose to go back to work Monday. DAVIS says 'he has another

man (unidentifled) who has a camera with a tele-photo lense,

who will be assigned to take photographs of various places

of Interest to DAVIS.

DAVIS claims that the Nazis want to start conducting

raids on local Jewish synagogues and want to start looking

up Information and planning tactics

to taken against the JDI

and the ADI.

I was talking to SAM DAVIS and BARRY GODFREY

at GODFREY's house. last night. SAM was asking If we

know where he could find a two and one-half pound

block of C-4 plastic explosives, a one-hundred foot

roll of fuse, and some fuse-type blasting caps.

said he wanted then for the night of Novomber 22, 1971,

but did not say what for.

Most likely, ho only wants

to sell them to someone.

Ho also asked GODFREY 1f he

could provide him with armed cover for the night of

November 22, 1971, beginning at about 7:00 p.m. He

said. he would have to work late as he is building a

fenco for the Balboa Fence Company at the Rincon,

somewhere near Santa Barbara.

GODFREY hedged about

going along with DAVIS and said he did not know if he

could arrange It. DAVIS then sald not to worry about

It as he could easily got someone olse.

Last Sunday, SAM DAVIS, ROGER DRAPEAU,

BARRY GODFREY, and STAN MC DADE and his two sons;

SAM DAVIS had obtained some maps from BEITIE

HAUGHTON, which allegedly showed the Iccations of

some of TROY HAUGHTON's caches of arms, ammunition

and other equipment.

The particular map that was used

sunday, was hard to read; however, It is believed thai

the place marked on the map was actually located. Ine

story regarding this particular cache is that several

years ago TROY HAUGHTON and some of his companions

went on a week long maneuver in the desert near the

Banner Grade east of Julian, Callfornia. During this

week or maneuvers, they supposedly built a cache 0i

reapons and ammunition on the side of a cliff near the

highway and made a map to show its location. On Sunday,

we found a place where a beautiful hand laid rock wall

had

• been made against the side of a cliff within sight

of the Banner Grade Highway.

We took the wall down and

aug back into the cliff a considerable distance but found

nothing. It is the intention of this group to chock

this site again at a later date with a metal detector.

Last night BARRY GODFREY told that earlier in the

had core. to his house questioning him about the shooting

incident at the residence of Professor PETER BOHNER on

January 6, 1972. GODFREY said the detectives names, SANDERS

and SHIVELY, came on very strong as though GODFREY was a self-

admitted member of the SAQ. They asked what he knew about

the shooting incident and whether the SAO had been involved.

He told them he did not know anything about the shooting

except when he had read the paper, and he did not elaborate

on the SAO. They then asked him whether he had any 9 mm.

weapons to. which he replied he did not and that he did not like

that caliber. Following that, they asked him if he knew anyone

in the SAO who had anything to do with the incident and GODFREY

said that he did not. The detectives then said the shooting

incident was a very bad deal, and GODFREY agreed with them

stating it was very unprofessional and that if someone had

really wanted to do something to Professor BOHER, they could

have easily taken the front half of his building off.

GODFREY said the detectives were somewhat interested

DAVIS claims he will leave them at some other house he

According to DAVIS, the SAO has elected to

go ahead with printing and putting out the wanted

posters on President NIXON. According to DAVIS, PAUL

RUPLINGER will finance the printing which will be done

by BETTIS HAUGHTON.

The original plan is to contract

for 10,000 copies of the posters and to have them

distributed by CY ANDERSON in the Seattle, Washington

area; EV MOORE, at Phoenix, Arizona; LYLE MANNING, in

the State of Utah; JESSE CLAYBURN STEVENS, at Baltimore,

with a blasting cap, six feet of safety fuse anã an old card-

through an alley or walkway, removed the screen fron

an air vent and threw the device through the vent into ün area

under the stage of the theater. He then walked acout one block

away and waited for the device to etonate.

He indicated that

even at that distance he could feel the shock from the explosion.

Source said TAROPIC seemed to be greatly elate with the rasults

of the slast and kept saying, "I did it! I did it!" over and

over.

he considers to be pornographic entertainment.

ON JANUARY 18, 1971, BY JEROME

I have not been in contact with LOU CONDE in some-

time; however, I understand he is still politically active

especially in the group named Taxpayers

Concerned.

PAUL

REPLINGER is still in regular contact with CONDE.

CONDE has always had a reputation as a "blabber

talks about little things which

are not very important.

mount", but actually only coNDe is a clever, dynamic, ambitious

and hardworking person. He has a lot of money and is very

willing to put some of it into right wing activities.

CONDE has many Cuban exile contacts and 1s a Cuban

himself.

In particular, he 1s close to the Alpha 66 group

and can get them out to do things for him.

CONDE Is in very tight with the local tuna boat

association and I would imagine he also has many contacts

among the shrimpers and tuna sievers.

This is because he

has a marine engine and shipfitting business and does much

work for the fishing boats.

It is entirely likely that CONDE may be involved in

some way with Illegal arms shipments on some of these fishing

boats between here and some Latin American countries. If this

Is happening, I doubt that the weapons are coming to the

United States through the Latin American countries, but are

probably being purchased here and shipped to Cuban

guerrilla

organizations in Central and South America. It is also possible

that CONDE may secretly be doing some work to arm some of the

tuna boats to protect them against seizure by such countries

as Peru and Ecuador. He mentioned something about this to me

about a year ago.

It looks as though I may be going to the Gunsmoke

Ranch this coming weekend.

they had a shotgun shoot at skeet. The group at the Gunsmoke
