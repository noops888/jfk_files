with MARCELLO at the Town & Country Motel and was introduced

by MARCELLO to a group of individuals whose names he does not

recall, who, according to MARCELLO, were the majority stock-

holders of the Sawyer Downs Racetrack which is located in the

Shreveport, La., area.

Informant stated MARCELLO very firmly

stated he had no financial interests in this racetrack but

was endeavoring to assist the stockholders in the operation

of this track.

Informant stated that MARCELLO and the stockholders

wanted him to complete the building of the track and then

wanted him to run the track. It was his belief that while

MARCELLO stated he did not have

any active interests in the

track, he wanted to be in a position to control the hard

gambling which would naturally follow from such an enterprise.
