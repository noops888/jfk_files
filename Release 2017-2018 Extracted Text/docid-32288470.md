ALEX:

GUS, are you gonna see MOE for lunch or later?

I'd like to see him for lunch, but I don't know.

I got to get the answer.

FERRARO:

Well, just tell him, if you want to close the

door

on us, if that's what you want to do is

ALEX:

Do you want to go along?

FERRARO:

I'll go along, but if you feel that anything is

ALEX:

I want you to

FERRARO:

Not to go against you or degrade you, but you

Ward of the City of Chicago in the elections in April, 1963.

It is noted that this situation is also being convered by

CG 6486-C* and CG 6576-C* as well as CG 6498-PC. It is

interesting to note that from conversations furnished through

CG 6576-C* it is known that D'ARCO is counting heavily on the

support which he expects to get from ALEX.

From the above

conversation it would appear that the support of ALEX 1s not
