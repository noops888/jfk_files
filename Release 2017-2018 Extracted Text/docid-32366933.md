MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy. Director, Office of Security

FROM

: Raymond A. Warren

Chief, Latin America Division

SUBJECT

: Vladimir Rodriguez Lahera

1. The House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA)

has

requested that we arrange an interview for them with

Subject (former AMMUG/1) who defected from the Cuban Intelli-

gence Service in 1964.

Subject is now a U.S. citizen and

entered the U.S. under PL 110.

2.

Subject's last known address was 2931 SW 19th Terrace,

Miami,

Florida, telephone (305) 443-3027. Henry S. PACHANKIS (P),

a career associate assigned to LA/Miami Station was Subject's

contact in the Miami area.

PACHANKIS attempted to locate

Subject; however, the

telephone had been disconnected and a

visit to subject's residence revealed that he had moved and

left no forwarding address.

The post office box established

for subject's use was serviced and there was no communication

from Subject notifying us of his change of address and/or phone

nunber.

The HSCA considers their interview with Subject to be

extremely important and your assistance in locating

the where-

abouts of Subject through your Miami office on a priority basis

would be nost appreciated. It is requested that no contact be

made with Subject when his whereabouts is ascertained since we

prefer to have someone whose bona fides

is established contact

him and arrange for the HSCA interview.
