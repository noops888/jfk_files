Mr. Patrick Carpentier

Office of the Legislative Coursel

Central Intelligence Agency

Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Carpentier:

In connection with its investigation into the circum-.

stances surrounding the death of President Kennedy, the Select

Committee on Assassinations requests access to all files and

file references pertaining to the following

individuals:

1) Edward Jay Epstein

2) Marvin Kantor

3) Charlotte Bustos

DO NOT REPRODUCE

RETURN TO CIA

4) Annie Goodpasture.

In addition, please provide the Committee with access to

the following information:

5) Any and all investigative reports prepared by e.

Howard Hunt pertaining to the John F. Kennedy assas-

sination.

'(These reports were not necessarily pre-

pared during the period of MI. Hunt's employment

with the CIA).

6)

The Committee previously requested access to all CIA files

pertaining to E. Howard Hunt in its letter to you of January 6,

1978. However, Roger Gabrielson, of your staff, has requested

that the particular requests identified above, be put in writing.

The Conmittee would also appreciate a response from the Nf

The CIA's written statiment replying to the Committee's

request of February 21, 1978 for an explanation of the

criteria that governed the opening of a 201 file dur-

ing the years 1958-64 was not responsive to our inquiry

because the CIA's written statement did not focus on the

relevant time period. Accordingly, I am renewing our

request of February 21, 1978:

In the event that there

were no criteria governing the opening of such files

during that period, the Cormittee would appreciate a

written statement indicating that this was the case.

CIA document #563-810 indicates that there are 37 docu-

ments that should be in Lee Harvey Oswald's 201 file

but which are missing from the file. Furthermore, this

document also indicates that there should be a machine

written explanation of where those documents are 10-

cated and

why they do not appear in Oswald's 201 file.

Pursuant to my letter of December 27, 1977, I would like

to note that the document referred to in this paragraph

is a classified document.

9) After having reviewed both the documents contained in

the CIA's files on Priscilla Johnson McMillan and the

materials that were independently made available to her

under the Privacy Act, it is apparent that the files

which were made available to the Committee did not in-

clude HTLINGUAI materials. As the Committee has

already requested all information contained in your

Illes on the individuals who are the subjects of our

requests, please review the files that you have pre-

viously made available to us for the purpose of ensur-

ing that all of the information pertaining to the

individuals involved has. in fact, been provided.

Finally, the Committee would like to interview all persons

the CIA's

Station for that period. The Committee requests that the CIA :

either make these persons available for our staff to interview

or provide their last known

address so that we can contact them

directly.

Thank you for your continuing cooperation.

sincerely,
