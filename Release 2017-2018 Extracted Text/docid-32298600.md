Enclosed for New York is copy of a CIA intelligence

report dated 12/9/66 classified

"Secret" and

concerning the

"impressions and observations of

canadian fellow travelers

who have visited Communist China.

The CIA data relates to a group of (Canadian 5)

"leftists" who visited China in October, 1966,

at the invi

tation of the Chicom Government.

Some members

the group

came away opposed to the "Cultural Revolution."

During the tour, the group was briefed in Peking

on current conditions in China by T'ANG Ming-chao (0181/2494/

3564, CTC), who was described as Vice Chairman, Chinese

People's Committee on World Peace.

Certain members of the

group created

somewhat of an uproar by asking awkward

questions and making critical observations against the

"Cultural Revolution."

• (11)

It is believed that this is the same T'ANG

Ming-chao who is reported to have been closely associated

with

Israel Epstein and who is also a contact of subject.

He is also

believed to be identical with the individual who

is reported to be head of political intelligence for English

speaking countries

on behalf of the Chicoms.

Recent reports indicate that Israel Epstein

and his wife were arrested in China for espionage, Michael

Shapiro was arrested for espionage, Sidney bittenberg was

purged from his job at Radio

Poking and Anna Louise Strong

was condenned by vall posters as "an inperialist agent."

Sue Frank is obviously concerned about these roports,

so much so that she is taking a trip in the near future

to London and possibly Paris in an attempt to detormine

truth or falsity of these reports.

NY 4047-Sa has

advised that the above arrests have been the subject of

discussions between Frank and her friends, all of whom

appear to be quite upset.

It slogical to assume that frank has contacts

among (Canadian pro-Chicon organizatione, peace groups and

individuals of similar 1lk.

Taking all of the above factors into consideration,

it might be very timoly to direct an anonymous typewritten

letter to T'ANG Ming-chao, Vice Chairman, Chinese People's

onna tree on World Peace

Poking, China, and mailed from

the arrests and purge of the individuals mentioned above.

The writer could point out that he net T'ANG in October,

1966, and at that time expressed some concern at the excesses

of the "Cultural

Revolution" and that these excesses appeared

to be continuing.

The writer could further state that his friend

from

New

York, Sue, a loyal Maoist, and an acquaintance

of T'ANG, conveyed to the writer her deep concern about

the fate of the aforementioned individuals.

The writer

could then conclude the letter by stating that he would

not

identify himself or Sue for fear of disclosure of their

identities to the Canadian authorities.

It would appear that such a letter would

accomplish several objectives.

P*ANG would most certainly

know about whom the writer is

talking when ho referred to

Sue and he would be concerned that Frank has communicated

with someone who does not appear to be politically sound.

If Frank is a spotter for the Chinose, this would raise some

question in the minds of the Chinese as to her capability.

Secondly,

it can be assumed that T'ANG would

be upset

that Frank had been indiscreet enough to indi

cate to anyone that

there might be a relationship between

T'ANG and Trank.

He would

atcribute

this indiscretion

on Frank's

to her concern over the arrest and purge

of hor friends

in Peking.

Frank's

very trip to london

would confirm

anonynous letter writer's statement

of Frank's concern and T'ANG's suspicion as to the

reasons benind her andiscretion. cou)

Thirdly, if it can be determined that frank

is subsequently confronted concerning the letter,

this

would contirm the suspected relationship between the

and frank. My 4044-5- would be

useful in this regard (k)

Finally, if such a letter can be gotten out

expeditiously and timed to coincide with Frank's

trip to London and/or Paris, it could well result

a serious disruption of her actempt to dotermine

Sue Frank is known to have wide-spread contacts and it

is

arrests in Peking of several of her Caucausian friends who are

working there for the Chicons.

She is taking a trip to London

approzimately 7/29/68 to ascertain the fate of her friends. *It is

being recommended to New York that we turn these arrests to our

advantage by having an anonymous letter written by a person in

and subject over the aforementioned arrests.

The primary

objective of this operation is to shake the confidence of the
