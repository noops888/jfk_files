New Jersey; that JOHN MISURACA told them to tell the fellows

in California not to "crack" when interviewed by the FBI; that

money and attorneys would be made available if they were

needed.

Informant suggested to ALEX that they advise their

"Capo" ANGELO MARINO of San Jose, California regarding these

interviews by the FBI.

ALEX told informant they should say

nothing to the membership in san Jose at this time because

the latter would think that they are attracting the FBI's

attention.

ALEX told informant that what the San Jose group

doesn't know won't hurt them.

ALEX CAMARATA advised SP 2550-C-TE that he was

staying away from his home at nights, as well as during the dey,

in order to avoid the interview with

the FBI.

Informant advised PETE MISURACA did not inform

was interviewed at San Jose on 2/13/64. He denied membership

and knowledge of La Cosa Nostra and denied knowing any of its

members, but was somewhat disturbed when advised it was known

that he

was a member of that organization.

the Califorila Cheese Company of San Jose, indicated his competitor

in the cheese business probably gave out the false information

of his being a member of La Cosa Nostra.

especially indicated concern about our knowing of his membership

In the organization.

ANGELO indicated to CERRITO that the

interview with the FBI was for a duration of about an hour and

a half.

CERRITO was very critical that ANGELO or any member

of the organization should allow an interview with the FBI to go

for more than a few minutes.

CERRITO indicated they should

merely tell the FBI they have nothing to say and suggest they

contact their attorney.

SF 2550-C-TE advised the interview between ANGELO

MARINO, and the FBI was not generally known to the membership of

This interview with ANGELO MARINO apparently is of

great concern to the leadership of La Cosa Nostra in the San

of handling this type of situation; that

ZOCCOLI requested LANZA not mention to CERRITO that

ZOCCOLI had discussed this

matter with LANZA.
