Article in the New York "Daily News," attached, reported

that a top Justice Department official had admitted that FBI Agents follow no

"specific, published, or regular guidelines when they spy on civilians they

suspect of being trouble makers." This refers to inquiries being conducted

by the Senate Constitutional Rights Subcommittee. The article further reports

that 'the gathering of intelligence on civilians" was turned over to the

Justice Department, particularly the FBI, following revelations that the

Army had "overstepped its bounds" in gathering intelligence on/ civilians.

It is further reported that Senator Ted Kennedy was told that the FBI did

not have any specific regular guidelines to follow, only "some internal

working papers." Kennedy then told a Justice representative that Justice

efforts fall short in protecting the rights and liberties of the American people.

The Director inquired "What about this? H."

In the first place, FBI Agents do follow specific published

guidelines in conducting investigations.; Our investigations are based on

Executive Orders issued by the President and on specific statutes passed

by Congress. We do not conduct random "spying" on civilians. As a

matter of fact, our investigations are controlled to insure we do not invade

the constitutional rights of citizens. For example, in the field of technical

surveillances no installation of technical devices can be made until approved

by the Attorney General. We neither investigate nor report on legitimate.

activities of any group..

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. Brennan

RE: DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE GUIDELINES •

ON INTELLIGENCE GATHERING ACTIVITIES

Concerning the allegation that the FBI assumed

Army's "function" of "spying on civilians," this is not true. You

will recall that the military received wide criticism for their activities

in investigating and compiling files on civilians. As a result, the

Defense Department sharply curtailed military intelligence gathering

activities. This did not increase the Bureau's responsibilities or

activities. We assumed no Army function. As set out above, our

I responsibilities are based on Executive Orders and statutes.

While it is true that the Department of Justice does not

furnish specific published general guidelines to the Bureau, it is also

true that the Department does review this Bureau's work. In all cases

information developed by our investigations is furnished to the Department

for its consideration as to violation of Federal statutes and possible

prosecution.

Senator Kennedy's statement shows his animosity to

the Bureau. It implies that the Bureau is "violating the civil rights of

the American people." This, of course, is utterly without foundation.

ACTION:

For information.

My memorandum 3/18/71 stated that FBI Agents follow

specific published guidelines in conducting investigations.

Mr: Iolson inquired "What are they?"

Guidelines in conducting investigations are furnished

to the field in the "Manual of Instructions," the "F.B.I. Handbook, "

and in letters to All Special Agents in Charge. Inaddition,

guidance is also given the field in Bureau communications on

specific cases.

The "Vanual of Instructions" sets out specific guide-

lines for all matters investigated by the Bureau.

yor example,

Section 122 covers investigation of racial matters,

includine

the

investigation of Klan and white hate groups. Section 87

furnishes specific guidelines for the security investigation of

groups and incividuals. In accition to setting out desired

investigation on these matters, the "Manual of Instructions,"

also sets out restrictions on investigations.

for example, in

regard to white hate groups and Klan matters it is specifically

pointed out that extreme care must be exercised to insure that

no investigation is conducted of groups or individuals who merely

support unpopular causes and that no investigation must be

conducted which will infringe on the Constitutional freedons of

speech, press or assembly. Investigation is confined to

organizations and individuals actually or allegedly using force

or violence to deny others their Constitutional rights.

Security investigations contain many restrictions.

FOr

example, sources and informants connected with an institution of

learning cannot be contacted on campus. Bureau authority is

required prior to developing such sources.

Nemorandum to Mr. C. D. Brennan

RE: GUIDELINES FOR FBI INVESTIGATIONS

Bureau authority is necessary prior to investigating communist

infiltration of a political organization. In the case of the

investigation of communist infiltration of a labor union, the

instructions clearly point out that thé Bureau is not interested

jin legitimate union activities.

Our instructions also contain numerous other

restrictions to protect the rights of individuals. For example,

no technical surveillance can be instituted without Bureau

authority; Agents cannot engage in improper, illegal,.or

unethical tactics in developing information; Agents cannot

misuse their credentials; Agents cannot visit trials or other

court hearings merely for the purpose of satisfying personal

curiosity; when testifying as a witness, Agents are instructed

to testify clearly or without bias or exaggeration; critical

complaints concerning Bureau personnel must be thoroughly

investigated; and personnel cannot engage in any conduct

prejudicial to the Government.

Close supervision

The use.of court-approved electronic surveillances

In the matter of applicant investigations, specific guide-

lines have been developed to protect the rights or individuals.

Favorable information concerning an individual must be obtained, as

well as unfavorable; investigation is limited to checks of pertinent

records and interviews of individuals in a position to furnish

relevant information; persons furnishing derogatory information are

requested to furnish a

signed

statement; we make no evaluation or

recommendation concerning the applicant.

Our investigative jurisdiction in criminal cases is based

on specific violations of Federal laws. Investigations are conducted

when information is roceived indicating a violation of a Federal law

within our investigative jurisdiction has occurred. The results of

our investigatios are submitted to the United States Attorneys or

the Department of Justice to determine whether prosecutive action

is justified. The course of prosecutive action is determined by the

United States Attorny or the Department of Justice. A decision may

be made to present te case to a Federal

grand jury or whether the

facts justify the arrest of the subject. When the subject is

arrested it is on the basis of authorized prosecution and the

issuance of a warrant.

When the subject is arrested he is brought

before the nearest Commissioner or Magistrate or Federal Judge in

CRIMIÑAL INTELLIGENCE

• AND

ORGANIZED CRIME

These investigations are divided into two principal

categories:

(1) the development and maintenance of complete

...and current intelligence on the activities of organized crime

In this country, and (2) the development of substantive cases

against individual racket figures, making use of various

Federal statutes providing the FBI a jurisdictional basis

in this specialized area of criminal activity.

-. Of nécessity the Bureau's organized crime program

has been carried on with a considerable degree of selectivity,

in that there are literally tens of thousands of individuals

in this country whose daily pursuits involve the promotion of

some form of organized crime.

Therefore, we have concentrated

on the leaders of organized crime and their associates on

whom we have developed specific Federal violations. In

concentrating on the control elements in organized crime, such

cases receive close supervision, with continuing central

direction from Bureau Headquarters.

The more sensitive the

Investigative lunction, the

more attention is altorded, particularly in our use of

court-approved electronic surveillance:

In conformity

• with

Title III of the Omnibus Crine Control and Safe Streets Act of

1968, this technique is utilized only.

after the Director's

referral of individual requests to the Attorney General for

his approval, and ultimate authorization by court order.

- All of our substantive cases, including those under

Federal antigambling statutes, Extortionate Credit Transaction

violations and Racketeer Intluenced and Corrupt Organization

matters, are, as noted above, restricted. to the more important

criminal operations in these

categories, and receive strict

scrutiny both in the field and at Headquarters in conformity

GUIDELINES

FUGITIVE INVESTIGATIONS

Authority to arrest individuals is statutory. Title

18, United States Code (USC), Section 3052, empowers FBI Agents

to make arresta and to carry firearms. The policy of the FBI

is to only use that force which is absolutely necessary to effect

the arrest with due consideration for the safety of the person

to be arrested, the arresting officers, and bystanders. In spite

of the existence of facts which might justify the shooting of a

fleeing person, it is the FBI policy that Agents are not to shoot

any person except for purpose of self-defense.:

In addition to conducting investigations to locate

individuals who have violated laws within the jurisdiction of

the FBI, such as bank robbery, kidnaping, extortion, the FBI

Is empowered by statute, Title 18, USC, Section 1073, to locate

fugitives at the request of state and local authorities when such

fugitives have been charged in a felony warrant and there is some

evidence of interstate flight.

At the specific request of the various branches of the

military, the FBI conducts investigations to locate persons charged

with desertion from the armed forces. Authority to make arrests

of such persons is found in Title 10, USC, Section 808.

FURLOYIES SECURITY AND SPECIAL INQUIRY INVESTIGATIONS

FBI conducts employee security investigations of

applicants or employees of Federal Government and United States

citizens employed by United Nations pursuant to and in strict

conformance with specific United States laws (Atomic Energy

Act of 1954; Arms Control and Disarmament Act; Public Law 298)

or Executive Order (EO 10450 and EO 10422).

In addition to

guidelines stated in those laws and Executive Orders, opinions

have been solicited from the Department of Justice over the years

as to whether connection with particular organizations or other

allegations justify initiation of investigation.

By request or agreement, FBI also conducts applicant

investigations of Presidential appointees, White House staff

members, Departmental employees and at request of cabinet members

and certain Congressional Committees.

All of these investigations are governed by further

specific guidelines directed toward protecting the rights of

individuals.

Those primarily applicable are:

Favorable information must be obtained as well as

unfavorable.

'Investigation is limited to checks of appropriate and

pertinent records and to interviews of individuals in a position

to furnish relevant information.

Persons furnishing derogatory information are requested

to furnish a signed

statement; if they decline, report so states.

Identification of individuals must be established with

respect to any derogatory information concerning them.

If pertient derogatory information is received

regarding close relatives or associates of applicant/employee,

degree of association must be determined.

All persons interviewed are advised inquiry is of

personnel type to preclude misinterpretation that criminal

investigation is involved.

FBI mares no evaluation or recommendation regarding

applicant/employee.

GENERAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION

in criminal cases

Our investigative jurisdiction/is based on specific violations

of Federal laws. Investigations are conducted when information is

received indicating a violation of a Federal law within our investigative

jurisdiction has occurred. The results of our investigations are sub-

mitted to the United States Attorneys or the Department of Justice to

determine whether prosecutive action is justified. The course of

prosecutive action is determined by the United States Attorney or the

Department of Justice. A decision may be made to present the case

to a Federal grand jury or whether the facts justify the arrest of the

subject. When the subject is arrested it is on the basis of authorized

prosecution and the issuance of a warrant.

When the subject is arrested

' he is brought before the nearest Commissioner or Magistrate or Federal :

Judge in accordance with established rules of Federal criminal procedure !

and the law.

Requests for FBI investigation in selected civil matters also

are received from the Department and/or the United States Attorneys in

cases in which the United States is a party in interest and are handled in ac-

cordance with guidelines furnished by the Department.

Civil rights, election laws, and antiriot law investigations are

handled in strict conformity with detailed guidelines furnished by the

The Director's attached routing slip asked "Shouldn't we have these all

I drawn together into a separate section of our manual? H. "

All these guidelines can be placed in one special section and

we recommend that this be done. The section on guidelines should be

the tirst in the manual, and all instructions to new Agents and others .

should take the position that the guidelines are foundation policy and

should be understood before moving into any type of investigation in

¡particular. These guidelines should appear in both the Manual of

PROPOSED CHANGES FOR

THE MANUAL OF INSTRUCTIONS

The following should be inserted in the Table of Contents

oi Volume I above and with same margin as Section I.

PREFACE. GUIDELINES FOR FBI INVESTIGATIONS

The following should be inserted as a Preface section in

Volume I immediately after the Table of Contents and ahead of Section I.

PREFACE

GUIDELINES FOR FBI INVESTIGATIONS.

Fundamental to all investigations by the FBI is the need to protect the

constitutional rights of any individual while still thoroughly and

expeditiously discharging those responsibilities with which it is charged

by statutes and Directives of the President and the Attorney General.

The FBI is a fact-finding agency which seeks with equal vigor to gather

evidence which will aid in the successful prosecution, or establish the

innocence, of alleged violators of laws of the United States or of those

who are accused of seeking by force to subvert or overthrow the

Government of the United States.

The FBI makes no determination of

the guilt or innocence of any individual or group so accused.

To this end, guidelines have been established to be followed in the

investigation of cases falling within the jurisdiction of the FBI, to

prevent unwarranted investigations and invasions of the constitutional

rights of any person.

INTERNAT SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS

For example, in matters affecting the internal security of the United

States, no investigation is conducted merely because an individual or

group supports an unpopular cause, or petitions the Government for

redress of grievances, nor do we investigate individuals solely on the

basis of their membership in organizations which do not seek the

overthrow of the United States Government by the use of force oi

violence. In addition, no electronic surveillance may be instituted

without the specific: authority of the Attorney General. Explicit

Bureau authority

must be obtained prior to conducting a photographic

surveillance and prior to investigating the communist infiltration

of a political organization. Bureau authority must be obtained

prior to conducting investigation at an institution of learning.

Bureau authority must also be obtained prior to the investigation

of faculty members or the interviewing of students,

faculty members,

of employees of institutions of learning. No investigations are

conducted of ambassadors or heads of permanent missions to the

United Nations.

Both Department of State clearances and Bureau

authoritylare necessary prior to the investigation of officials

and diplomatic representatives of foreign countries. Our investiga

tions of groups and individuals are limited to those who take an

extremist anti-United States Government position in that their

actions

indicate

involvement in assassinations, physical attacks

0n

persons or property, or other activitios endangering the rational

security.

Cilluluäl intelligence - Organized Crime

Where matters of a criminal intelligence nature or organized crine

are concerned, investigations are conducted to develop and maintain

current information; on

the activities of organized crime in general,

¡and to develop substantive cases against individual racket figures.

These investigations are highly selective and are concentratad

on the leaders of organized crime and their reported

Associates,

Any electronic surveillance used in these investigations requires

approval of the Bureau, the Attorney General, and authorization by/

For Special Agents of the FBI

Applicant-type Matters

In the area of applicant investigations, specific standards have been

established to protect the rights of individuals. All relevant informa

tion, both favorable and unfavorable, obtained concerning an individual

must

be duly reported; investigation-is limited to checks of pertinent

records and interviews of persons in a position to furnish relevant

information; persons furnishing derogatory information are requested

to furnish a signed statement. The FBI makes no evaluation or

recommendation to the requesting agency concerning the applicant.

General Criminal and Civil Matters.

Our investigative jurisdiction in criminal cases is based on specific

violations of Federal laws.

Investigations are conducted when

information is received indicating a violation of a Federal law, over

which we have been given investigative jurisdiction, has occurred.

Results of our investigations are furnished to United States Attorneys

or the Dopartment of Justice for determination of the course of any

prosecutive action. The decision may be made to present the case to

a l'ederal Grand Jury or, it the tacts so justify, to arrest the subject.

in which latter instance the arrest is made on the basis of authorized

prosecution and the issuance of a warrant. Upon arrest, the subject

must be brought before the nearest United States Magistrate or Federal

Judge in accordance with established rules of Federal crininal

procedure.

Requests for FBI investigations in selected civil matters in which tre

United States is or may be a party in interest are received from the

United States Attorneys and/or the Department of. Justice. These are

hardled in strici conformity with guidelines furnished by. the Departzer

¿of Justice, as are also investigations of violations of the civil rigis

antiriot, election laws, and antitrust laws.

General Principles

Doss not pertainto 'S 87

In addition to these principles, numerous other restrictions apply to

all phases of our work. For example, our authority to arrest fugitives

is statutory. The United States Code empowers Special Agents to make

arrests and

carry firearms but FBI policy further requires that only

that force may be used which is necessary to effect arrest with due

regard being observed for the safety of the arresting officers and

others.

Purpose of Paper

While moderate in its tone and subdued in tis anti-FBI

stand, this 70-page scudy is aimed at encouraging a public inquiry

by. Congress into the FBI's domestic intelligence data collection

and thus, will serve only to add quel to the fires of vicious

and

self-serving criticism against the Bureau.

Elliff clains

Committee for Public Justice

Origin of Security Intelligence

As do most critics of the FBI, Elliff notes the Director

was head of the General Intelligence Division in the "Palmer Raid"

days. Elliff states that the Director later deplored tactics

used to round up Individuals at that time and was able to persuade

the American Civil Liberties Union and Attorney General Harlan F.

Stone of his sincerity in opposing excesses at the time of the

"Painer Faids."

Ellift notes President Roosevelt's 9/6/40 memo-

randur and President Truman's directive of 1950 as authority for

IBI intelligence collection activities. Elliff claims the FBI

magnified President Roosevelt's 9/6/40 statement which called. for

local officials to furnish the FBI information received on

espionage, counterespionage, sabotage, subversive activities, and

violations of the neutrality laws into a definitive order serving

what it

considered its mission in intelligence gathering.

Scope of Security Intelligence

Noting the risk of describing the FBI'S intelligence

scopo on the basis of uvailable material, Elliff-obviously with

tongue in cheek-denies trying to create

the impression that the

IBI has exceeded its Constitutional authority.

He calls for

I/lunanation o1 aspecte of the FBl nd lully appreciated before

"so we may make reasoned judgments and factual, constructive

the targets of FBI security intelligence

coverage through the years as communists, communist front groups,

Nazi-intluenced and Fiscist-type groups,

the extremist New Leit,

and

groups with interational contacts

lintiltration. He mansions existence of an index of persons

considered detrimente: to internal security during Horld War II

as well as the curren; Security Index which he claims is used

ito identify persons rio might threaten

the president, while 1t

previously existed tur apprehenszon of potential sabotage subjects

in future periods of national energency. Ellift notes the FBI

must exercise discrecion on whether or not there are sufficient

facts to report in itters involving internal security and on which

Federal officials

siould receive such reports. He adits that the

FBI seeks to elimini te subjectivity by reporting all available

Information, following prescribed procedures, and use of "by-the-

book" patterns and cerminology.

Mand the Department of Justice. From documents stolen at the

dormer Media Resident Agency,

he notes the FBI's ghetto informant

groups produces much extraneous material, wiretaps are, in fact,

oiten the only way to obtain information

regarding possible

Elliff also discusses the BI's interest in

black student groups and Klan activities pointing to instructions

and recommendations from President Johnson and several study

commissions for intelligence coverage needed to alert Government

officials

to possible relal disorders.

EllifE's Conclusions

Ellili snidel:, concludes that "a little fresh air is

needed" in the form of periodic public scrutiny of the FBI. He

claims that if fault is to be found it would not be in the FBI

and the Director, but 22 the Attorneys General, Presidents and.

Congresses who gave power and responsibility to the FBI but

Halled to direct, guic:, and control it.

GUIDELINES FOR SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS

OF INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS

"Washington Post" article on 2/24/72 stated that

Deputy Attorney General Richard G. Kleindienst

testified 2/23/72

that he is "not sure" what

guidelines are used by the FBI

in

deciding to investigate an individual or organization. The

Director noted "Prepare succinct memo to him on our

guidelines."

The line of questioning which apparently gave rise to

Kleindienst's statement regarding guidelines revolved around our

security-type investigations.

Therefore, a memorandum has been

prepared along these

lines and is attached.

The essence of the attached memorandum is that the FBI

investigates all organizations which have as their basic objective

the violent overthrow or destruction of the United States.

Typical organizations, such as the Communist Party, USA; Socialist

Workers Party; Progressive Labor Party; Black Panther Party and

Students for

a Democratic Society, are

listed as examples.

The

obvious aims

and purposes of the international communist movement

are explained.

Responsibility and jurisdiction of the FBI under

statutes and Presidential Directives relative to the nationàl

security are set out.

Circumstances under which security investigations of

individuals are conducted are

enumerated.

These basically have

to do with the fact that investigations are instituted when an

individual has revolutionary, extremist or anarchistic beliefs,

giving reason to believe

the

individual might commit acts inimical

to the internal security in time of national emergency.

Also set forth are the fundamental principles that the

FBI scrupulously safeguards the individual's constitutional

rights and impartially gathers evidence not only to prosecute,

but to prove the innocence of the individual.

HY 75165

By statute and Presidential Directives, the FBI is

charged with

the responsibility of coordinating all information

regarding che internal security of the United Staces.

In addition to provisions of the Smith Act of 1940,

Title I of the internal Security AcE of 1950, the Communist

Control Act of 1954, and statutes relating to

espionage, sabotage,

rebellion and insurrection, sedition and seditious conspiracy,

FBI authority and responsibilities for investigation of subver-

sive matters are clearly stated in Presidential Direciives dated

June 26, 1939, and September 6, 1939, which have been reiterated

and broadened

by subsequent Directives.

Commission of crimes such as espionage and sabotage

clearly involves specific statutory provisions.

Other subver-

sive activity, however, such as plotting the viclent over-

throw of the United States Government, often does noi clearly

involve a specific section of a specific statute.

activity may often involve several sections of several statutes..

It is a nell-established fact thai the basic ain of

the international communist movement is to overthrow all existing

nonconmunise covernments and to see up in their stead a conmunist

system of government.

This is true whether the communist nove-

ment be directed from Moscow or from the headquarters of the

Fourth International, which guides the Socialist Workers Party

in the United States.

The Snith Act of 1940 was aimed at the international

communist movement.

However, statutes dealing with rebellion

and insurrection and seditious conspiracy could cover any attempt

at violent overchion or destruction of the Government.

Insofar

the

FBI is concerned, therefore, any organization whatsoever

which has as an objective the violent overthrow or destruction

of the United States Government, or which engages in such acts

as espionage, sabotage or other criminal activity detrimental

to the national defense, would be subject to a thorough in-

vestigation.

Furthermore, any individual who has nembership

in or who is affiliated with or adheres to the principles of

such organizations

would likewise be subject to thorough

investigation.

The fBi, therefore, has basic guideiines for con-

lucting security investigations of organizations and individ

uals, in connection with the national security.

Organizations

The FBI conducts investigations of the Connunist

Party, USA; Socialist Workers Party; othor Marxist revolutionary-

type organizations, such

as the Progressive Labor Party; front

grOUps; New Left and miscellaneous organizations, such

as the

Students for a Democratic Society, Black Panther Party and

miscellaneous other revolutionary

organizations which

are

dedicated to violent overthrow or destruction of the

United States Government.

The purposes of our investigations are to:

1. Obtain legally admissible evidence for prosecution

under existing Federal

statutes.

2. To

obtain sufficient pertinent data to determine

the organization's character and permit implementazion of

Executive Order 10450.

3.

To obtain intelligence data in order to have day-

to-day appraisal of strength, dangerousness, and activities of

the organization; and to keey the Department of justice and

other affected Government agencies advised.

Individuals

The FBI has the responsibility to conduct thorough

investigations into the background and activities of all per-

sons in the United States and Puerto Rico who are dangerous or

potentially dangerous to the internal security of the

United States.

Danger or potential danger of such individuals

may involve membership in or affiliation with basic revolution

ary

organizations, or other Marxist revolutionary organizations

including

splinter groups.

H# 55165 DocId:32989586 Page 40

## Page 41

Guidelines for Socurity Investigations

of Individuals

and Organizations

Purposes of investigation include:

1. Determination of dangerousness.

2.

To fully establish identity, whereabouts and

activities of all individuals who have been or may be violating

laws of the United States relating to the national

security.

3.

To obtain admissible evidence to establish a

violation of laws of the United. States.

4. To be alert for indications of espionage, sabotage,

or sedition.

The activities of any individuals should be investigated

if they fall within one of more of the following categories:

1. Membership in a basic revolutionary organization.

2. Espousing the line of revolutionary movements.

Such espousal could encompass a wide variety and range of

activities.

Actual membership in a basic revolutionary organi-

zation is not a prerequisite.

Espousal may be expressed by

membership or active participation in subversive

front groups.

Mere membership in a front organization, however, is not con-

sidered sufficient grounds for investigation, unless there

has been past membership in a basic revolutionary organization

os other subversive activity.

3. Special training such as training in a subversive

movement abroad; or leadership training in a basic revolutionary

organization.

4. Individuals employed in or having access to a

Key facility who are alleged to have been at any time members

of a basic revolutionary organization.

5. Other individuals with anarchistic, revolutionary

or extremist beliefs who are likely to seize upon a national

emergency to endanger public safety and welfare. •In such cases,

membership or affiliation in basic revolutionary front groups

are not prerequisites.

the individual must be protected. The FBI is a fact-finding

agency which impartially secks to gather evidence which

will either aid in the successful prosecution of, or establish

the innocence of, alleged violators of laws of the United States

or those who are

accused of seeking by

• force to subvert or

overthrow the Government of the United States.

The FBI makes

no determination of the guilt or innocence of any individual

or group so accused.

For example, in matters affecting the internal security

of the United States, no investigation is conducted merely be-

an individual or group supports an unpopular cause, ox

petitions che Government for redress of grievances, not do we

investigate individuals solely on the basis of their membershin

in organizations

which do not seek the overthrow of the

United States Government by the use of force or violence.

In

addition,

all of our investigations are carefully followed and

supervised at numerous levels of supervision, both in the

field and at FBI headquarters.

One of the primary purposes of

careful supervision of FBI investigations is to assure

that at

.no timo will the

constitutional rights of an individual be

placed in jeopardy.

M.A. Jones to Bishop memorandum concerned a letter from

John T. Elliff, Assistant Professor, Department of Politics, Brandeis

University, who requested an interview with Mr. Gray. The letter enclosed

two studies entitled "The Scope and Basis of FBI Domestic Intelligence Data>

Collection, " and. Aspects of Federal Civil Rights Entorcement: the dusticer:

Department and'the FBI, 1939-1964.", Mr. Gray requested that these papers--

be thoroughly analyzed and sound rebuttals prepared. The first paper

dealing with Domestic Intelligence data is analyzed herein. The second,

dealing with Civil Rights enforcement, is being handled separately by the

General Investigative Division.

SYNOPSIS:

• Mr. Elliff's study, which was presented at a two-day conference

last October at Princeton sponsored by the Committee for Public Justice,

consists of 70 pages of cetailed observations and conclusions based on a

study of 126 sources, including copies of numerous FBI documents stolen in •

the Media Resident Agency burglary. Mr Elliff's paper is a calm,

unemotional, scholarly study and for the most part is objective and is not

highly critical of the FEi. He has exhibited a lack of understanding (or else

has brushed off the significance) of the internal security threat posed by

the domestic subversive. His main thrust is, home ver, that certain

domestic intelligence investigation is necessary, but that any such activity

on the part of the FBI should be fully authorized and circumscribed by statute.

He strongly suggests, among other things, a separation of domestic and

toreign intelligence-c. llection functions and he believes that a permanent

dome stic intelligence advisory council, similar to the existing foreign

Intelligence Advisory Board, should be established. Ellift also calls for an

Eye ligation of the FBI by a select Senate committee.

Ilemorandum for Mr. Miller

RE: "THE SCOPE AND BASIS OF FBI DOVESTIC"

INTELLIGENCE DATA COLLECTION" - JOHIN T. ELLIFE

DETAILS:

John T. Elliff presented a 70-page copyrighted study during a

two-day conference sponsored by the Comr-tee for Public Justice at

Princeton, October 29-31, 1971. The study isted 126 sources of information

for documentation. Included in the list of sirces were at least 30 FBI

documents stolen during the burglary of the BI Resident Agency at Media,

Pennsylvania. Elliff's study notes that revelations of the Media documents

resulted in emergence of a vague picture o FBI intelligence activities.

He acknowledged that fragmentary news stozies, second-hand accounts,

papers taken out of context, and unverified charges brought more confusion

than enlightenment about the FBI's operations. He stated that major changes

in the FBI's mission had not been readily perceived and that disclosures

like the Media documents are distorted beczuse they enter an analytical

vacuum.

OBSERVATION:

While this premise is apparently based on Elliff's review of a

great deal of material he attributes to historians, he does not take into

consideration that the operations of the FBI have constantly been open to

public scrutiny through Mr. Hoover's annual apperrance before the House

Appropriations Subcommitee and his numerous public statements in the

news media and publications produced by the FBI.

THE SUBVERSIVE THRAT:

Elliff went into quite some detail concerning the interpretation of

subversive danger to te country both as it related to the fascist threat of

the 1930's and World Var Il era, and the communist threat extending into the

present.

OBSERVATION:

Elliff exh sited a lack of understanding of the danger to the Nation

by the subversive elements including both the fasrists and communists. While

he referred to the ??I's first intelligence investitions as being directed

against "fifth colur ists" in 1934, he did not stru's in sufficient detail just

how dangerous this 'fifth column" of Nazi and fascist sympathizers really was.

RE: "THE SCOPE AND BASIS OF FBI DOMESTIC

INTELLIGENCE DATA COLLECTION" - JOHN T. ELLIFF

He then said that the term "fifth column" has been out of fashion since the end

of World War II. This observation may be true insofar as the fashionable

use of the expression is concerned. But, factually the concept of the

"fifth column, " as it can be applied to international communism, was even

stronger following World War II.

Elliff fails to stress the fact that following World War II Soviet

Russia enslaved the peoples of Eastern Europe with its communist ideology,

using the concept of "fifth column" tactics to seize control of government

after government. Elliff speaks glibly at one point of a pilgrimage to

Washington of several thousand youths which was sponsored by the American:

Youth Congress, a communist front organization. While admitting the

communistic nature of the group, he implied, mainly through omission,

that the communist influence was insignificant. He noted, however, that the

President clearly desired this sort of information.

Elliff pointed out that at one point the FBI had estimated that almost

one million people had been drawn into communist-front activity, but he

failed to go into the tremendous significance of a million people being

involved in an activity which was manipulated by an ideology which preached

and preaches the violent overthrow of the United States Government.

He made the statement that the Communist Party, during the

period 1935-39 softened its revolutionary line, virtually endorsed the New Deal,

and adopted a policy of alliance with noncommunist groups and that because

of this the potential range of FBI intelligence extended to every left-liberal

organization that was an object of communist infiltration. Again, through omis-

sion he failed to take note of the fact that the communists have never really

softened their revolutionary line. The philosophy of "the end justifies the

means" has been the backbone of communist strategy and any "softening of

its revolutionary line" has only been for the purpose of duping the gullible

and the naive. A scholar such as Elliff should certainly be aware of the

philosophy of deceit which is a trademark of the Communist Party.

In discussing organizations included on the Attorney General's

list of subversive organizations, Elliff refers to the Trotskyist Socialist

Workers Party as being nearly defunct. Elliff, who is an Assistant Professor

in the Political Department of Brandeis University, displayed an amazing lack

of knowledge of the Socialist Workers Party. It is not only not nearly

defunct, it is today one of the most militant of the so-called old line revolutionary

organizations and its influence on the antiwar movement and youth organizations

is very strong. Its revolutionary stance has not diminished and the

treatment afforded in Elliff's study certainly would lead one to believe

that the Socialist Workers Party represents no danger to our national

security.

PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVES:

Elliff's study is largely concerned with the legal authority for

FBI intelligence-type investigations. He pointed out that from the time

Mr. Hoover was appointed Director until 1936 he had a policy of "closed-end

investigations" as described below, but that ultimately this policy gave way

to intelligence coverage which involves continuing investigative work within

a broad range of delegated authority. He points out that we have claimed to

have derived authorization or our responsibilities in the domestic intelligence

field from legislative enactments, Presidential directives, and instructions

of the Attorney General.

Concerning the authority derived from Presidential directives, Elliff

goes into some detail concerning the issuance of the Presidential directive

of September, 1939, which has been reiterated on three subsequent occasions.

Apparently based on a study of the Roosevelt papers and other material of

record, Elliff presents a picture of Mr. Hoover manipulating President

Roosevelt into issuing the September, 1939, directive, implying that

Roosevelt may not have realized that he was shifting the basis of FBI

authority from Congressional statute to Presidential directive. Elliff:

states at another point, iowever, that Roosevelt probably assumed he had

already granted this authority in 1936 when he requested intelligence

investigations of fifth columnists.

Elliff declares that Roosevelt's 1939 directive (or statement) had to

be an assertion of inhr rent executive power, but that the evidence suggests

that Roosevelt did not intend to grant such authority. He said that there is

now the impression that the White House was never clearly informed of the

legal situation and that the FBI later magnified a statement (the 1939 directive)

into a definitive ords:

Memorandum for Mr. Miller

RE: "THE SCOPE AND BASIS OF FBI DOMESTIC

INTELLIGENCE DATA COLLECTION' - JOHN T. ELLIFE

OBSERVATION:

It is true that we have cited the 1939 Presidential directive, and

the succeeding ones re-iterating it, as one of the bases for our authority to

carry out responsibilities in the domestic intelligence field. While the

full intent and purpose of the initial directive will be the subject of critical

analysis by legal minds, politicians and historians for years to come, we

now see in retrospect that there is a definite weakness to any actual

interpretation of the directive's conveying a legal authority not already

existing by Congressional statute. We are currently making an in-depth

study of the etfect these directives have on our intelligence investigations.

It is dangerous to make a hasty judgment on the legal basis of the

| 1939 et sequens directives, since much of our extremely important

investigative activities are at stake.

It would appear on the surface,

however, that existing statutes which were ignored by Elliff in his study

I cover most if not all of our investigations of subversive activities. Statutes

such as Title 18, USC 2383 (Inciting to Rebellion or Insurrection), Title 18,

USC 2384 (Seditious Conspiracy - Conspiracy to Overthrow or Destroy the

Government), Title 18, USC 2385 (Advocating Overthrow of the Government),

and several others appear to be sufficient basis for our security investigations,

whether the questioned directives exist or not.

We believe without doubt that the type of investigations we have

conducted over the years and are conducting now in the interest of national

security are very necessary. The question as to whether the so-called "closed-

end investigation" as would normally be conducted in an investigation of a

criminal violation should also be the only type investigation conducted

relative to investigations involving statutes relating to the national security

is absurd. A criminal-type investigation usually takes place after the crime

has been committed. We cannot allow a crime against the Government to

occur. Therefore, where conspiracies are afoot and where ideologies are

based on the destruction of the Government there must be continuing

intelligence investigations if for no other reason than to neutralize the threat.

A good example is the matter of the investigations which continue

on Communist Party functionaries such as Gus Hall. Gus Hall was investigated,

tried and convicted and served time in a Federal penitentiary (as did other

high-level officials of the Communist Party) for violation of the Smith Act.

These people, without exception, now out of prison, profess the same beliefs

as before, including the basic belief of overthrowing this Government.

We believe that it is not necessary to close an investigation

gimply because enough evidence has not been collected to support prosecution

of an individual whom we have reason to believe will attempt to overthrow

or destroy the United States Government. As long as the circumstances

indicate the danger to the Nation exists, we feel that a continuing investi-

gation is necessary. We believe also that statutes can in most every case

be cited as a legal basis for investigation of this sort.

There are, however, situations which are so vague as to defy a

statutory connection. Many of these situations involve instructions from the

White House to furnish information or intelligence on matters relating to

policy making and planning the national defense, or foreign relations. In

such cases we have relied on the so-called inherent executive power to

order an investigation required in connection with executive responsibilities.

In such cases the reliance on the 1939 et sequens directives has been, a

means whereby White House requirements could be handled.

CONSTITUTIONAL POWER OF THE PRESIDENT

Ellitf raises the question as to whether the so-called inherent

executive power gives him the broad authority to issue an executive order

or Presidential directive which could give authorization to the FBI for

conducting intelligence irestigations.

He acknowledges that the Department

of Justice maintains that done stic intelligence functions are within the.

inherent powers of the F.'esident, which are not dependent upon any grant of

legislative authority fro:: Congress, but derive from the Constitution itself.

Elliff belittles this Depa mental position.

He states tha: in connection with language in the 1968 Omnibus

Crime Bill (wiretappir ) which related to the President's constitutional

power, Senator McCle an, who introduced the Act, later remarked that

the Congress had not ‹ ren considered that question in 1968.

OBSERVATION:

It is questionable that Elliff, in spite of his scholarly approach to

this study, has the 1: ekground and legal credentials and knowledge to attack

the constitutional quastion of the scope of so-called inherent executive power.

We certainly believ. that the President does have the constitutional power to

direct the FBI to do whatever is necessary to protect the national security

and that a Presidential directive which does not abrogate the various constitu-

tional amendments or impinge on the statutory rights & the citizen would

have the full force of legislative authority.

There are questions before the Supreme Court at this moment,

however, dealing with the very issue raised by Elliff and in the present

political climate where established concepts of Government policy,

including our own investigative policies, are under attack by civil libertarians,

it is difficult to say how broad the Presidential power may be tomorrow.

ELLIFE'S CONCLUSIONS:

Elliff stated that appropriate legislation or administrative reforms

could be drafted and adopted only after a thorough scrutiny of FBI functions;

that first a firm constitutional foundation should be established for domestic

intelligence. He suggested that a legislative framework might adequately

authorize the most vital functions.

We agree that if it were possible to have a legislative framework

to adequately cover the myriad situations affecting the national security, this

would be the best possible situation. We certainly have no fear of our

investigative activity being circumscribed, so long as adequate provisions

are made for protection of the national security. It has long been the policy

of the FBI that the first consideration in our investigative activity is the

protection of individual rights of the citizen.

It is extremely doubtful that at this point in time with the political

climate existing as it is today that any meaningiul legislation could be drawn

in Congress which would give the FBI the legislative authority, beyond that

which we already have, that would respond to Elliff's suggestions.

CONCLUSIONS CONTINUED:

Elliff suggested that serious consideration should be given to

separating foreign counterespionage duties from dome stic intelligence.

He

notes that requirements for the two functions are substantially different

and that indeed the controversy over FBI "political surveillance may hinder

effective counterespionage contacts.

RE: "THE SCOPE AND BASIS OF FBI DOMESTIC

INTELLIGENCE DATA COLLECTION" - JOHN T. ELLIFF

OBSERVATION:

There have been other suggestions of separating various functions

of the FBI. We feel that while there is some merit in the principle that

there is a difference in the way foreign intelligence matters are handled

and the way domestic intelligence and criminal cases are handled, it would

be impractical to have a complete separation of functions without an

enormous administrative problem. At present there is a flexibility of

use of Special Agents which means that under our present administrative

structure literally thousands of Agents are available to handle any given

case of importance whether it has to do with a Soviet illegal agent or a

kidnaping.

We already maintain, to the extent practical, a separation of all

our various functions so that we have specialists handling foreign intelligence

matters in most offices and other specialists handling domestic intelligence

and criminal cases. Where needed, however, such as in a surveillance

, across the Nation, large number of additional Agents can be pressed into

service. This would not be possible with the kind of separation suggested by

Ellitf. There are other reasons why such a separation would be impractical.

CONCLUSIONS CONTINUED:

Elliff suggests that a permanent domestic intelligence advisory

council, similar to the existing foreign intelligence advisory board, should

be established. He notes that the latter is a part-time group of outside

consultants which makes reports to the President, the reports not being

made public.

OBSERVATION:

Elliff does not go into enough detail asto what effect such a council

might have on the operations of the FBI. The FBI makes reports to the Presi

dent's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, and we can find nothing which

would indicate that this Board does not serve a useful function to the

RE: "THE SCOPE AND BASIS OF FBI DOME STIC

INTELLIGENCE DATA COLLECTION" - JOHN T. ELLIFE

CONCLUSIONS CONTINUED:

Elliff was not highly critical of the FBI's investigative policies or

activities. He advanced the suggestion that a public inquiry of the FBI is

in order, and that such an investigation could be undertaken by a select

Senate committee. He said, however, that such an inquiry would not seek

to discover illegality, but rather to evaluate for the first time the Bureau's

overall mandate against the norms of the Constitution. He said that if fault is

to be found, it would not be sought in the Bureau and its Director, but in

the long line of Attorneys General, Presidents and Congresses who

have given power and responsibility to the FBI.

OBSERVATION:

There have been numerous efforts over a long period of time to

have congressional committees or other outside agencies conduct a public

inquiry of the FBI. However, whatever noble purpose might be behind

Elliff's suggestion or those before him that a public inquiry into FBI

operations should be instituted, the whole idea is preposterous when

consideration is given to the confidential nature of our FBI files.

We have nothing to hide from the standpoint of our administrative

policies and operations.

3ut what committee would stop at administrative

policies? We have already seen what can happen when our investigative

files are opened to the curious ones. Our Media documents and material

leaked to such persons &3 Jack Anderson are taken out of context and used

for purposes wholly unir ended. Both in the case of the Media documents

and the Anderson documents, information was publicized that would have

never seen the light of ay; would never have damaged a reputation; would

never have violated a t ust had they not been exposed to public view.

We have been accused of maintaining "Secret files" or "dossiers"

with the implication tr.it we have two sets of files. Such is not the case.

All FBI files are confidential and with the exception of maintaining highly

classified material under more closely guarded conditions because of

regulations requiring it all FBI files are treated the same.

RE: "THE SCOPE AND BASIS OF FBI DOME STIC

INTELLIGENCE DATA COLLECTION" - JOHN I. ELLIFF

The lives of both criminal and security informants and other

individuals depend to a large measure in the FBI maintaining strict control

over its files and information. We frankly would not trust the lives of

others to members of an investigating committee who could not comprehend

the necessity for keeping our records from public scrutiny. We are

unalterably opposed to any investigating committee being given access to

our complete operations. We are confident that the American people share

this view.

SUMMARY:

As noted herein, Elliff's study is calm, unemotional and scholarly.

Whether the Presidential directives he refers to are valid remains to be

seen. We feel that the President does have the power to issue directives •

giving us authority to conduct intelligence investigations. We even feel

that a comprehensive directive from the President could sweep away many

doubts, even in our own minds, as to the actual scope of our authority in

conducting intelligence investigations. However, being realistic, we feel

that the political climate which would no doubt preclude any meaningful

additional legislation in this area, would also prevent the issuance of any

such directive during an election year. Meanwhile, we are endeavoring to do

the job which everyone, including Elliff, recognizes is necessary, and

to do this job using the statutes where possible as basis for authority as

we have always done, but following Presidential mandate in any event on the

basis that the President possesses the power to protect internal security.

containing results of the study. With Mr. Gray's concurrence a

study was instituted and a committee was formed consistis, of

SAs k. J. Decker, A. W.. Gray, C. W. Thompson and myself

from Domestic Intelligence Division, E4 John Hotis of Legal

Counsel's Office and Mr. D. M. Armstrong of the lcting Direcion's

Office. You designated me to act as chairman. The committee

was to conduct the in-depth study referred to above and to submit

a position paper.

Unfortunately for our project, SA Hois was

reassigned to another position part way through the study and

Sis J. I Williamson was designated to seplace him as a

representative of Juegal Counsel's Office.

The study has been

tedious and has necessarily required a great deal of time to date.

Material to study has been difficult to locate and a tremendous

amount of research was necessary to determine how much statutory

authority we actually have.

There is division of opinion among the committee

members as to whether Presidential directives issued during the

pre-World War Il period and afterward are legitimate sources of

current FBI investigative authority and whether statutes on the

bookscan be used as the basis for conducting intelligence-type

investigations where there is no specific violation of law involved.

Examples of cases where some dependence on the Presidential

directives is believed necessary, or some authority other than

statutory authority is required were submitted by the various

Sections supervising Domestic Intelligence Division cases. These

examples were incorporated into the study.

Re:

Domestic Intelligence Division

'Scope of FBI Authority, Jurisdiction

and Responsibility in Domestic

Intelligence Investigations

There is attached a drait of a position paper written

by me, based on research of all available records and documents

and of the examples furnished by individual Sections and on a

painstaking review of existing statutes covering some or all phases

of Domestic Intelligence Division work. To support this position

paper there is also submitted as an exhibit to the position paper

a compilation of statutes, together with recent court decisions

affecting some of them; copies of Presidential directives and

Executive orders relating to Domestic Intelligence Division work;

and copies of various memoranda and other documents used to

support the position taken in my paper.

It is recognized that the points of view taken in the

altached paper are in many instances based on opinion and con-

clusion which may be subject to question or rebuttal from a legal

standpoint. It is also recognized that in some instances it might

appear that the FBI's investigative policies, both past and future,

are being undermined by the conclusions reached in this study.

However, it is believed that with the pressure being applied to

dig into the FBI's investigative policies and guidelines, it is

imperative that if there are weaknesses in our policies or

procedures we must expose them, admit they exist, and eliminate

them without delay.

It is my firm conviction that intelligence-type

investigations conducted in the past and which certainly will be

ncessary in the future have been firmly based in lawful authority

derived from statutes and constitutional power of the President

as set forth in Executive Orders 9835 and 10450, but that we have

overstated our authority supposedly derived from Presidential

directives issued from 1939 through 1953. I strongly feel that upon

completion of our position paper we should then call upon the

Attorney General to provide legal guidance and advice as to just

how much authority we have or need to conduct the investigations

necessary to protect the national security.

The arached position paper is submitted as a

Status report for the Acting Director and for the review oi each

member of the commitee designated to participate in the study.

This is a starting point. I sets forth the intormation which we

have been able to locate. It should now be read critically and

objectively by each member of the commitee and thereafter each

should submit his views in writing to voice dissent, rebuttal,

observations, additional evidence supporting their views or

additional evidence supporting this paper, and any recommendations

not covered in the paper.

It should be borne in mind in reviewing this paper

that there is at least one lawsuit pending against the FBI, et al,

(MUHAMMAD KENYATTA, et al versus J. EDGAR HOOVER, et al,

Civil Action No. 71-2595 in the United States District Court for the

Eastern District of Pennsylvania) in which the very issue of the

FBI's legal basis for conducting intelligence-type investigations

may have to be shown in court. Therefore, our final position paper

must be realistic and factual and not be a whitewash or a perpetuation

of misconceptions of the past.

Captioned column (copy attached) which was headlined

"Blockade fails to Halt Hanos Supplies" contains a section titled

"Finuncial Secrets" comprised of information on the financial

dealings of antivar activists Dr. Benjamin Spock and Jane Fonda,

as well as on floyd Mckissick, Negro civil rights activist.

The information was taken, sometimes verbatim, from

the ollowing FBI documents:

(1) a 4/15/68 New York Office

report on Spock classified "Confidential"; (2) a 2/23/68

"Top

and (1) a 1/20/72 Los Angeles Office report on Fonda classified

"Secret, No Foreign Dissemination, No Dissemination Abroad."

Concerning Spock, Anderson notes that an FBI inquiry

at the Amalganated Bank of New York revealed that Spock had

recalved a check dated 12/12/67 for $500 from the Fifth Avenue

Viet:on Peace Parade Committee. This information was set forth

in tire New York report (Anderson calls it an FBI meno) dated

would require subpoenas or customer consent for authorities

At that time Anderson

reportedly furnished the subcommittee with copies of what he

Anderson seems to be going into more detail utilizing the FBI

documents which he claims to possess.

Smith to Miller memo dated 8/1/72, captioned "Position

Paper, Domestic Intelligence Division, Scope of FBI Authority, Juris-

diction, and Responsibility in Domestic Intelligence Investigations, "

enclosed a 43-page position paper containing results of a detailed study

concerning captioned matter.

Conclusions set forth in the 43-page study were that

we must sweep away the myth that the FBI now has any investigative

authority based on Presidential directives dating from 1939 and that

any responsibility we derived from those directives is so outdated as

to be very questionable if not entirely void.

Also concluded was that the FBI has valid reason to

conduct intelligence-type investigations based on Federal statutes

relating to various types of subversion affecting the national security.

It was also concluded, however, that while it would be ideal to have

definitive legislative enactment spelling out our jurisdiction and

authority to conduct intelligence investigations the political climate

today is such to stifle any attempt to formulate needed legislation.

For this reason it was recommended in the study that

• we request the Department to seek a comprehensive executive order

which would cover any jossible gaps between statutory authority and

Executive necessity in protection of the national security: 1 1 97-1822

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re:

Scope of FBI Jurisdiction

and Authority in Domestic

Intelligence Investigations

Mr: D. M. Armstrong, and Miss Catherine Doohan. The 43-page

position paper was discussed at length and there was general agree-

ment that the 1939 and subsequent directives give the FBI little

if any current authority to conduct intelligence investigations. There

was some disagreement as to whether intelligence-type investigations

could be conducted on the basis of existing Federal statutes. How-

ever, this issue was not resolved since there does not appear to be

any legal precedent relating to the matter.

The committee was unanimous in the conclusion that

the FBI badly needs an updated executive order which clearly

delineates FBI authority and responsibility to conduct intelligence

investigations. It was agreed that we should prepare a proposed

executive order and submit it in a letter to the Attorney General

for consideration by the Acting Director. After careful study a

proposed executive order has been drawn up and is included in a

letter to the Attorney Geueral which outlines the necessity for such

an executive order. This letter is attached.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the ettached letter to the Attorney General

requesting the issuance of an executive order be approved.

By letter dated 9/15/72 Professor John T. Elliff,

Brandeis University, referred to a previous letter from the Acting

Director, 5/30/72, concerning an interview with the Acting Director

and members of his staff relating to the FBI's domestic intelligence

system. The 5/30/72 letter indicated a meeting would be arranged

after the Acting Director had an opportunity to conduct his own

studies. Professos Elliff renewed his request for interview and

suggested late November be considered as an appropriate time.

T. J. Smith to E. S. Miller memorandum 6/2/72;

captioned "The Scope and Basis of FBI Domestic Intelligence Data

Collection - John T. Elliff," reported a detailed analysis of a

study submitted by Professor John T. Elliff during the two-day

conference in October, 1971, at Princeton University spors ored by

the Committee for Public Justice. In essence Professor Elliff's

study was a calm, unemotional, scholarly study relating to our

domestic intelligence-type investigations. The study for the most

part, was objective and not highly critical of the FBI.

Major thrust of the study revolved around authority

and jurisdiction of the FBI in the domestic intelligence field, and

he argued that our authority in this area is questionable 115358-

Memorandum to Mr. W. M. Felt

Re: Professor John T. Elliff

Brandeis University

Request to Interview the

Acting Director and Staff

dated 9/13/72 a letter to the Attorney General was submitted for

the Acting Director's consideration. The position paper concluded

that certain Presidential directives cited by the FBI as one of the

bases of our authority to conduct intelligence-type investigations

vested little, if any, authority in the FBI to conduct such investi-

gations. Professor Elliff reached the same conclusion. Our

position paper, however, and our letter to the Attorney General

asserted that our intelligence-type investigations are conducted

under an umbrella of legislative enactments. Our letter to the

Attorney General requested that an Executive order be sought

which would clearly delineate FBI authority and responsibility to

collect intelligence information for the President in the interest

of natinal security.

Professor Elliff undoubtedly wants to explore further

into questions already raised about our jurisdiction and authority.

Domestic Intelligence Division stands ready to assist in any dis-

cussions Professor Elliff desires to have with the Acting Director.

However, for various reasons, it is believed that any such dis-

cussions should be postponed until the results could not be used

as a political issue during and immeliately following the national

elections. Also, since we are awaiting important response to our

request for an updated Executive order, which could also be delayed

until after the elections, it would be more propitious to wait until

our request has been handled by the Attorney General.

The Acting Director has publicly announced intention

of offering his resignation to the President after the election. There

is no question in our mind that this wouldie accepted by the President

and we can, therefore, expect confirmation procedures by the Senate

to begin shortly after the election. We think that issues which are

likely to be raised by Protessor Elliff in the domestic intelligence

field should not be exposed to public view prior to a confirmation

hearing.

Therefore, we propose that the attached letter be

sent to Professor Elliff suggesting that due to heavy commitments

through the next several weeks it is not possible to set a date for

an interview with him until at least the latter part of November.

. Attached for approval is complete revision of Section 87

of the Manual of Instructions which governs our basic policies

and procedures in handling domestic security matters. This

rewrite represents a major step in the evolution of our policies

in this area from heavy reliance upon various Presidential Directives

dated back to the 1930s to a jurisdictional approach based on existing

Federal statutes. As indicated in prior communications, including

a detailed "Position Paper" submitted by this Division 7/31/72, we

have for some time recognized the need to more closely relate our

work in this field to its underlying statutory authority.

Memorandum to Mr. Felt

Re: SECTION 87

;

MANUAL OF INSTRUCTIONS

to preclude any unwarranted or excessive inquiries. Our investigations

have been soundly based even though we did not spell out the statutory

basis on which they rested.

The need to emphasize our statutory authority more clearly

became evident in the Spring of 1971 when Senator Ervin initiated efforts

to obtain from the Justice Department the specific guidelines governing

the FBI's operation in this area. Later in 1971, Professor John Elliff

presented his detailed study of FBI domestic intelligence operations at

the Princeton University conference held under the auspices of the

Committee for Public Justice. Elliff's study was concerned to a major

degree with questioning the validity of the Presidential Directives as a

firm basis for our security investigations.

Based on our detailed consideration of this matter, we believe

the answer to this matter is relatively simple although it will require

some adjustment on our part. We should base our investigations

of domestic subversion squarely on statutory basis and make it clear in

our communications and reports that this is the case. This is the

principal objective of the attached rewrite of Section 87 which includes

the following major changes:

(1) Title of Section has been changed from "Security Investigations"

to "Investigations of Subversive Organizations and Individuals. " We

believe the term "security investigations" is too broad and indefinite

whereas the new title conreys the idea that investigations covered

under this Section (namely, investigations of persons or groups seeking

to overthrow or subvert the Government) are directed at a particular

type of activity.

(2) We have revamped the basts and criteria for investigations

to make it clear throughout that our investigations are based on existing

laws, the chief of which are the statutes dealing with rebellion or

insurrection (Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 2583), seditious conspiracy

(Title 18, U. S. Code,

Section 2584), and advocating the overthrow of

the Government (Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 2585).

(3) Rules cov ring Administrative Index (ADEX) have been

updated in line with changes approved last Fall. At the same time, the

1W 55165 DocId:32989586

## Page 70

Memorandum to Mr. Felt

Re: SECTION 87

MANUAL OF INSTRUCTIONS

intluence of the ADEX program as a controlling factor in investigations

has been eliminated. Revised chapter stresses that ADEX is strictly

an administrative device and should not play a part in investigative

decisions or policies.

(4) We have eliminated overemphasis on Communist Party (CP)

which has characterized this Section in the past. CP is no longer singled

out as the prime subversive organization as this is no longer the case.

(5) Instructions regarding FBI responsibilities and agreements

with Defense Department agencies regarding individuals employed at key

facilities and with private contractors holding defense contracts are

being eliminated from Section 87. They will be incorporated in Section 102

(Coordination with Other Government Agencies) where they are believed

to more properly belong. This will be handled separately.

(6) Current rule requires that FBIHQ approval be secured

for members of other law enforcement agencies to accompany FBI Agents

in handling these investigations. This is being revised to provide for

'SAC approval: Actually, necessity to use officers from other agencies

rarely occurs. Where the need does arise, it is believed the SAC should

be able to make the decision.

(7) Entire chapter has been streamlined and made more

readable and better organized. It is about one third the size of existing

Section.

The new concept advanced in the revised Section 87 with its

stress on a statutory approach will no doubt prove to be a difficult

adjustment for many of our Agents who have become accustomed to

handling these cases under the existing procedures, format, etc., for

many years. In addition, there may be some "bugs" in the new system

which we have overlooked.

Accordingly, it is felt that we should allow a certain amount of

time for the field Agents and Supervisors to review the new procedures

and policies prior to their actual implementation. In this regard, we will

arrange so that when the new chapter has been printed and is being

distributed to the field, we will instruct the field by SAC Memorandum

that they are not to be put into effect for a certain period of time, for

example, "30 days.

During this interval, field will have an opportunity to carefully

study the new format and to raise any questions which arise with FBIHQ.

In addition, it is believed we should hold several regional-type conterences

with key Supervisory personnel of the major security offices to iron out

any problems which may exist in connection with converting to the revised

format. Such conferences could be led by several knowledgeable supervisors

from FBIHQ staff. Such conferences would be invaluable in eliminating

misunderstandings or confusion and insuring that we make a smooth

adjustment to the new policies.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the attached revision Section 87 be approved. Additional

recommendations will be submitted relative to the distribution of this

Section when printing is completed and for the holding of regional field

conterences.

It is requested that, upon approval, the printing of revised

Section 87 be expedited so that we can distribute it to the field as soon

as possible. As indicated, there will be some delay involved to allow fe

thelfield to assimilate the new procedures and we want to keep the over

all delay in implementing them to a minimum.

SECTION 87: INVESTIGATIONS OF SUBVERSIVE

ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS

A. GENERAL GUIDELINES

1. Investigative juridiction.

FBI investigations under this soction are based on specific

statutory jurisdiction and Departmentel instructions.

Investigations conducted under this section are to be

directed to the gathering of material portinent to a

determination whether or not the subject has violated,

or is engaged in activities which may result in a violation

of, one or more of the statutos enumerated belovi or in

fulfillment of Departnental instructions

There are three principal statutes which provide a basis

for these investigations; as follows:

Rebellion or insurrection (18 USC 2383).

"Whoever incites, sets on 100t, arsises, oi engages

or insurrection against the author

ity of the United States or the lars thereos, or

gives aid or comfort thereto, shall be fined not

more than $10, 000 or imprisoned not more

than ten

years, or both; and shall be incapable of holding

any office under the United States."

b.

Seditious conspiracy (18 usC|2384).

"If two or more persons in ahy Stale or Territory,

or in any place subject to the jurisdiction of the

United states, conspire to overthror put down, or to

destroy by force the Governnent of the United States:

or to levy

war against thom, ior to oppose by force

the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder.

or delay the execution of any law of the United States:

or by force to seize, take, or possess any property

of the United States contrary to the authority

there

of, they shall each be fined not more than $20,000

of imprisoned not more than twenty years, or boch."

Advocating the orerthrow of the Governnent (18 USC 2385) .

In addition to the three principal

statutes outlined above,

there are two other statutes which might provide a statutory

foundation for an investigation under this section.

These are:

d. The Internal Security Act of 1950 and the Communist

Control Act of 1954 (50 USC 781-810).

In summary: these statutes make it unlawful to

knowingly

contribute to the establishment of a

totalitarian dictatorship within the United States

•which is controlled by a foreign government, organi-

zation, or individual. The statutes also impose

various restrictions on the activities of members

of organizations cited by the Subversive Activities

Control Board, (SACB). as "communist action,"

"communist front," or "conmunist infiltrated"

groups.

The restrictions apply principally to

employment by the Federal government or by a asfense

facility.

The former SACB cited only one organization, the

Comnunist Party, USA, which was named as a "communist

action" group.

2.

Prosecutive determination.

All discussions pectaining to the prosecutive potential

of investigations initiated under this section will be

conducted by FBIHQ with Departmental officials. these

cases should not be discussed with local U. S. Attorney's

office without FBIHl approval.

3.

Related statutes.

There are a number of other statutes under the FBI.'s

investigative jurisdiction which should be borne in

mind in handling these investigations. Information

concerning possible violations of such statutes is.

frequently developed during these investigations.

Where this occurs the field should consider the desir-

ability of conducting investigation in line with the

policies and procedures governing the statute in question.

A list of other Federal statutes which may arise during

these investigations is outlined in an appendix to this

manual, setter

Conduct of interview.

(a)

Interviews of subjects entitled to the warning

and waiver shall be conducted in accordance with

the requirements set forth in Volume I, Manual of

Instructions, Section 2B, page 15. If the inter-

view is being conducted for intelligence informa-

tion rather than an admission or confession of

guilt, no warning

is required. Moreover, if the

investigation has

failed to develop information

indicating a possible violation of Federal law

by the subject, it would be permissible to inter-

view the subject without a warning as he does not

fit the criteria of those entitled to a warning

of rights. Carefully plan interview so there

will be no compromise of sources, sensitive tech-

niques or interviewing personnel. An overriding

consideration to always bear in mind is that

interview should elicit from, not provide infor

mation to the subject.

(b)

Interview at subject's place of employment should

be avoided if possible.

If attorney or aide is

present during

interview, interview must be con

ducted li? two Agents.

(c)

If, during conduct of interview subject desires

that his attorney or aide be present, the inter

view should be tactfully terminated, and FBIHQ

his attor a tenay

should be informed with recommendation whether

or not to resume interview.

(a) In all other instances, SAC has responsibility

and option of deciding when two Agents should

handle

nterview.

Safety of Agents is first

priorí. to consider.

17) Direction is subject's activities.

Prior FBIll: approval is required before taking any

steps to d'rect the subject's activities even though

he may apfar to be cooperative during the interview.

(8)

Reporting esults of interview.

(a) Recori results of interview on FD-302.

(o) Perti ent results of interview should be included

in neit report or LIM unless circumstance's indicate

need

for more expeditious reporting.

tion

ADMINISTRATIVE INDEX (ADEX)

Purpose and general policy

a.. To have a readily available and up-to date listing

oI individuals deemed currantly dangerous to the

national security.

objective is to identify

individuals who should be afforded priority

investigative coverage in the event of a national

emergency.

b.

Under no circumstance should individuals be included

in ADEX merely because of their opposition to

Government policies or because of the exercise of

their constitutional rights of protest and dissent.

c. ADEX is strictly an administrative device. It should

not be treated as a factor in determining basic in-

vestigative decisions, i.e., whether an investigation

should be opened or closed, the extent of investiga-

tion to be corducted

in

a particular case, etc.

2 .

Criteria

a.

ADEX should include individuals whose

actions or

statements have established that they represent

current treat to the national security, i.e.:

Indivi uals whether affiliated with organized

groups or not who have shown a willingness

and cipability of engaging in treason, rebellion

•or insurrection, sedition, sabotage,

espionage,

terrorism, guerrilla warfare, assassination of

gover tent officials, or other such acts which

would result in interference with or a threat

to th.: survival and effective operation of

national, state or local government.

b. Ihis wou. include leaders of organizations whose

aims inch de the overthrow or destruction of the

Governme: : Oi the United States or the government

of any £ ate, territory, district, or possession

thereo, or the government of any

political sub-

division therein, by unlavful means.

"leader

'denotes

The term

those individuals, irrespective

of titl

, who are in a position to significantly

influen a the policies or direct the activities

of the

coup.

Mere membership in an organization,

without the element of leadership or without a

demonsi rated willingness and capability described

in par-graph a, is not sufficient for inclusion in

ADEX.

C .

Indivi: uals should be considered

a "current threat"

to th

national security when reliable information

has b:on developed that they have engaged in activity

- 27-.

HH 55165 DocId:32989586 Page 102

## Page 103

or exhibited the requisite willingness and capability

falling within the above-described criteria during

prior two years and there is no indication they

have ceased such activity. Howevei, there may be

instances where retention of an individual in ADEX

is available during the prior two years. For example,

such retention might be warranted in the case of

individuals who have

gone into hiding, temporarily

left the country, or been imprisoned.

a.

• ADEX should not include individuals

who may be ideologically committed to a philosophy

which calls for the downfall of our form of government

or which favors another forn of society but who

have not shown a current willingness or capability of

engaging in meaningful action to promote their

beliefs.

This might apply, for example, to rank-and-file

members of the Socialist Workers Party or the Communist

Party, USA, or other

old-line revolutionary groups

which have

avocated

an overthrow.of

our present

form of government but where subject's activity

is primarily ideological in nature and not oriented

toward action.

Each case should be reviewed on an

individual basis in the light of the criteria

enumerated

above.

3. Recommendation for preparation of ADEX card.

a.

when dangerousness

of subject has been

established,

oftice oi origin should prepare secommencation on

FD-1aL, in triplicate. Forwaro original

and copy

to FBINQ, and place copy in subject's tile.

b.

Attach additional page or pages to FD-122 setting

out succinct summary of facts, on which recommendation

based.

C.

Non-piosecutive summary report should be submitted

when

subject is

racommended for ADEX unless one was

previously furnished to FBIHQ. In latter instance

submit up-to-date report.

d.

Do not delay recommendation for ADEX because of

absence of complete background or descriptive data.

e. Do not defer recommendation for ADEX because subject

is missing, temporarily out of the country, or in

prison.

It FBIHQ approves recommendation, ADEX cards

will be prepared including two copies for field.

Copy Of FD-122 will be returned stamped "ADEX card

approved, copies attached." Check cards for accuracy.

FBIHQ appreciates responses to reButels made by various field offices,

including pinpointing of areas of possible misunderstanding. Any additional

observations regarding the pending changes in our procedures will be welcomed.

It is suggested, however, that comments be focused on regulations which have

been revised in the rew manual chapters rather than on those which have been

in effect for a number of years.

In some instances, field offices have misinterpreted certain portions

of the new manual chapters. In addition, a number of specific questions have

been raised regarding manual provisions. Accordingly, and in order to insure

a smooth transition to the new rules, implementation of these revised

procedures is being deferred. Additional instructional material is currently

being prepared at F 317Q to provide field with necessary background information

-as to underlying basis for these changes and also in response to the particular

_ questions raised. This additional data should be in your hands in early July

jang implementation of new regulations is postponed until 8/1/13

¡In addition, FBIHQ is planning to hold a series of regional conferences

=with FBIHQ representatives. Further information regarding these conferences

willbe provided at a later date.

investigation be shown on the first communication

prepared (intraoftice memorandum, letter, airtel,

etc. should be modified since there will be occasions

where preliminary inquiries will have to be undertaken

before it is known whether a statutory basis for

investigation exists. This is particularly true with

regard to indivittuals identified as being in contact with

known subversive groups or subjects, where the purpose

of the contact is not initially known. Accordingly, we

should modify the regulation to require that a statutory

basis be shown in the first communication prepared for

outside dissemination (letterhead memorandum or report

but that it need not be shown in strictly internal

communications for a period not to exceed 90. days.

This will allow time for preliminary inquiries to be

Memorandum to Mr. Miller

Re: SECTION 87

MANUAL OF INSTRUCTIONS

3 - Regarding interviews of subversive subjects,

the Manual now instructs that they should be

interviewed in the absence of "exceptional

circumstances." Field supervisors made a

strong case for relaxing this requirement,

especially since there are many subjects who

are known to be hostile towards all Government

authority where no purpose would be served in

seeking to conduct an interview. Accordingly,

we are recommending that the instruction be

changed so that subjects should be interviewed

"unless there is a sound basis for not doing so."

4 - Manual now requires FBIHQ approval for

interviews of subjects who hold "leadership

positions" in a subversive group. The consensus

of our recent conferences was this should be

eliminated and that the SACs should be allowed

to approve such interviews. It was pointed out

that the term "leadership position' is vague

and unclear and further that, in any case, FBIHQ

approval is required whenever subjects are

"nationally prominent."

5 - Concerning dissemination of information developed

it was the consensus of our conferences that

mention be made of our responsibility to disseminate

pertinent information regarding persons holding

clearance with the Armed Forces to the Defense

Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO).

Memorandum to Mr. Miller

Re: SECTION 87

MANUAL OF INSTRUCTIONS

6 - In order to deal with the problem of field office files

building up an accumulation of channelling memoranda

and creating space problems, it was decided that we

should include some provision for the destruction of

such memoranda by the field at the option of the

appropriate supervisor. This can be done through the

preparation of an "investigative insert'' for later possible

inclusion in a letterhead memorandum or report.

7 - It was suggested and agreed upon that the Manual should

include brief additional instructions regarding reporting

procedures for ADEX (currently dangerous subversives)

subjects. This includes the necessity for a summary

type report at the time the subject is recommended

for inclusion in ADEX and the need to keep FBIHQ

periodically advised of investigation of ADEX subjects.

These requirements were initially established in September,

1972, at the time our current ADEX policy was initiated.

8 - It was agreed that the period for a preliminary investigation

of subversive organizations should be expanded from 45 to

90 days.

ACTION:

Attached is an airtel to all offices dealing with these

modifications and instructing that they be put into effect

immediately. Manual revisions will be separately submitted.

MANUAL OF INSTRUCTIONS

SUBVERSIVE INVESTIGATIONS

1 - The requirement that FBIHQ approval be obtained

for interviews of subjects who hold "leadership

positions" in a subversive group is being deleted.

5 - The Bureau's responsibility to disseminate information

concerning persons holding clearances with the

Armed Forces to the Defense Industrial Security

Clearance Oifice (DISCO) is being added to the Manual.

6 - In order to deal with the problem of field office files

building up an excessive accumulation of channelling

memoranda on subversive subjects, provisions are

being made for the destruction of such memoranda

following preparation of an "Investigative insert"' which

can be used later, i needed, in preparing reports or

LHMs or in transferring the office of origin.

7- The period for a preliminary inquiry concerning a newly

formed subversive organization is being expanded from

45 to 90 days.

8 - A separate paragraph is being added to that portion of

Section 87 which covers the administrative index

outlining proper reporting procedures for ADEX cases

including the need for a summary type report at the

time an individual is recommended for inclusion in ADEX.

Appropriate changes are being made in the Manual with respect

to the foregoing modirications. However, these changes should be

placed into effect immediately throughout the field. Any questions

regarding their implementation should be promptly directed to FBIHQ.
