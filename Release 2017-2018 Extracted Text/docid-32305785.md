ICN

MONTREAL, QUEBEC

CANADA

It has been previously reported that in January,

tor 45 years and Beatly mentioned Montreat, auced,

"Been in Canada"

as a location where he had considerable influence.

On April 8, 1968, BU T-16 advised that information

Hamilton, Ontario,

SCIBETTA had visited Niagara Falls, New York, where a meeting

of about 45 minutes' duration took

a member of the

"Magaddino Family, "Place between these men and

BU T-16 furnished no

further information at this time concerning this meeting.

ICN

INTERNAL DISSENSION

On August. 25, 1967, BU T-4 advised that leadership

in LCN was still vested in STEVE MAGADDINO, with FRED

RANDACCIO next in line to assume command of the "Family"

contingent upon the outcome of the legal proceedings against

him.

On December 26, 1967, BU T-6 in discussing the likely

successor to RANDACCIO as Underboss, pointed out that such

discussion was pure speculation and that MAGADDINO would not

name a successor until all of RANDACCIO's appeals have been

exhausted. BU T-6 pointed out that if MAGADDINO should name

a successor before RANDACCIO's appeals were decided and

RANDACCIO was subsequently released from prison, a power

struggle leading to violence would probably evolve betweer

RANDACCIO and whoever was named as his successor.

BU T-6 stated

that RANDACCIO Is feared by most

of his underlings and actually hated by many of them.

Many members of the

are actually glad

that RANDACCIO iS noW

BU T-6 pointed out that

the "Magaddino Family" was then without an "operating head"

in Buffalo and, as a result, 1s in a disorganized state.
