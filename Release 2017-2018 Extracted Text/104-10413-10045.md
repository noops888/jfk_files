him. In vie: of rioxico's important position in the "nentralist non-inter-

invaluable asset for ODYOKe policy makers. The present Ainbassador has chosen

do use this channel on several occasions.

he has asked for special briefings, and one such report on the India-Red

with rorard to events which might be considered as bearing on the

security of this project, the Station reported that on 15 June 1902, at

approximately 0?30, the concierge noticed two men standing directly across

the street from the Lf and who scened to have an unusual intcrest in the

activity of the Lf. After aucul, an hour both got in an automobile and con-

tinued to watch the building from the car, and from tine to time appeared

• to be taking notes on the comings and goings of the installations, as well

as making notes on the cars used by the personnel of the It. They attempted

to follow one If employee when he left for lunch. Later that day, LIENVOY-2

and LIENVOY-ll, approached one of the two surveillance men and asked for an

explanation of his action that day. They also asked him to identify himself:

He showed them a driver's license with the name liariano VERA Gonzalez. This

infornation nas checked at the Department of Traffic and found to be the

license of another person.

The Traffic Department was staked out to deter

mine who, if anyone, night show an interest in the nanes and addresses of

the cars used by IP personnel. On the loth of June, an agent of the secret

Service of the Folice Headquarters showed up and tried to obtain information

about the orner of the license plates on LIENVOY-2's car. The stake-out

employee and Secret Service man checked the traffic files, but the information

was not there. In conversation with the Secret Service man, information vas

gained which led the Station to suspect that he was a member of an investi-

gative group headed by a Mexican whose aim is to obtain political information

for Mexican politicians. Since the 15th, no further attempts to place the

LP under observation have been noted. Any problems such as this can be

handled, if necessary, by. the COS and his government contacts since this is

a joint venture.

6. During the past project year, there have been 235 disseminations

based on LIENVOY and LIENVOY-2 information: 200 from the former and 36

from the latter. LIENVOY reporting covered such topics as:

a. Activities of Mexican leftists such as

b. World Peade Council.

c. Soviet and Czech activities in Mexico.

d. Activities of Soviet and Czech officials in lexico.

e. National Liberation Movement (MIN).

REQUEST FOR PROJECT LIENVOY RENEWAL

A. Current Objectives.

The objectives of this project remain the same as those stated in

the last renewal request.

The project continues to provide the Mexico

Station with a smooth and rapid channel to

figures.

The Principal Agent continues to be a close associate of

The intercept center has undergone no major changes during

the past year.

1. RIDDM-6 Objectives Priority A, 1. a; Priority A, 4, a, b, C;

and Priority B, 2 and 3 continue to be effectively covered

by this

project. Cordial and friendly relations continue between

and the Chief of Station, Mexico.

During the past year, the Chief of Station, Mexico, at the

request of the Chief, ODACID, Mexico, has held a number of covert

mectings with

to convey ODYOKE policy matters. The

Chief, ODACID,

remains pleased with this access to

2. 111 Soviet and Czechoslovak

Mexico City are covered by this project. The Case Officer

for Soviet Operations and the Case Officer for Soviet Satellite

Operations rely heavily on this prodact for operational leads

and data to support double agent operations.

3.

All major antI-PBPRIME elements in Mexico City are

covered by this project.

4.

Targets of opportunity which appear to be hostile or

critical to PBPRIME or to the present Government of Mexico are

covered by this project.

All major objectives of the project are being effectively realized.

B. Changes.

At a yet to be determined date, it is planned to move the intercept

center from its present location®

Twò reasons are behind this move:

1) security, since the present base has been used for alnost three years:

and 2) to provide the center with more mobile equipment. Such equipment

Is now under consideration by KURIOT and when it becones available, an

amendment to this project will be forwarded requesting approval for the

transfer of the intercept center.

C. Intelligence Produotion.

The activities report forwarded to Headquarters each month lists

the intelligence reports received from this project. During 1962 therc

were 534 intelligence reports produced by this project which were

forwarded to Headquarters through 1 December 1962. All of these

concerned RMDM-6 reporting priorities and current requirements levied

by Headquarters and the ODACID installation..

•In addition, this project produces a large amount of information

which is not disseminated on a current basis but is reported to ODACID,

ODENVY and other ODYOKE agencies in reply to a steady stream of routine

file trace requests.. These file trace requests run into the thousands

each month. It would be difficult to determine the exact percentage of

the information produced by LIENVOY; but in many instances involving

prominent Mexican Government officials, large portions of the file came

to us through LIENVOY coverage.

D. Effectiveness.

The LIENVOY project provides the Station with a channel to the

which is both effective and

rapid as

well as covert.

The Station continues to receive the daily

"resumen" highlights from the thirty (30) lines covered. A high

percentage of current Intelligence is disseminated from these daily

reports. In addition, full transcripts are received on Soviet and

lines and on any of the thirty targets we may request. A good

part of this is personality data useful only to KUBARK and in some cases

to ODENVY. In addition, the project provides a support mechanism for

covering targets of interest to KUBARK or other ODYOKE agencies.

E. Problems.

There have been no significant security, cover, control or liaison

problems during the past year.

F.

From a

point of view, the Station believes that this project

contributes reatly to the present friendly attitude of

toward ODYOKE policies.

though contacts between the Chief of Station and

are usually made at the request of the Chief, ODACID, Mexico.

G. Interagency Coordination.

The Chiof, ODACID, Mexico, 1s the only ODYOKE representative in

Mexico outside KUBARK who is aware of this project. His role has been

J. Annex.

The equipment and Headquarters technical support furnished this

project during the past year has been commendable. A project amendment

will be submitted requesting additional equipment for the transfer of

the intercept center as soon as modifications. and

estimates are known.

K. Emergency Conditions.

Should a crisis require the evacuation of the KUBARK staff agent

working inside the Intercept Center, contact can be maintained with

LTELEGANT at his clandestine apartment.

the Mexico Station. If the contact is not made by Willard C. CURTIS,

the use of his name should be sufficient introduction. LIENVOX/2 could

be contacted in the same manner at his home in Mexico City.
