States

he 1s or has been an epileptic. Reportedly has

served

time at Terminal Island.

on 3/23/67, Subject advised as follows:

Subject has read many books on the assassination

of President KENNEDY and he would like for this source, who

is a private investigator, to go to an office such as Mark

Lane and advise that he, this source, knows an individual who

viewed the assassination of the president and also viewed those

who committed

the assassination.

STEIFER stated that he knows

nothing about the assassination other than that what he has

read, however, he

believes that he has read sufficient

material to compose a fiction type story regarding the

assassination.

STEIFER then wants this source to somebody

such as Mark Lane and if Lane accepts it STEIFER will then

commence telling his story through this source.

STEIFER

is never to be known to the writer and will never be

in a position to testly regarding his story.

STEIFER is of the opinion that so many books

have been

written regarding the assassination that any

story could no doubt make thousands of dollars for the

three of them.
