SUBJECT: Comendation.

TO

: Strategie Services Officer, OSS.

I. It is especially desired to connend the OSS units that were ettached.

to or served in conjunction with this headquerters and toose Chinese Amies

and groups whose operations were coordinated tarough this beadquarters with

the Chirese Supreme Zeadquarters.

&e The varied and unusual tyce of duty performed by these units sade

their perfomance of duty most difficult.

In spite of the belief of reny

Ioreigners, based upon ordinary neis reports that the Chinese were fizished

guerilla fighters of long experierce in such operations against the Japanese,

thore was ectually little of

this type of coabat that had been carried on

effectively for the gast tho jears.

3. The arrival of aggressive and competent groups of officers, any

with prior comando

service in the Juropean Theater, rrovided a great impetus

to the Chinese.

These young officers, with little or no prior service in

China, were eble to obtain the coridence of the Chinese entiraly beccaso of

their =ilitary efficiency and ability to teach and produce results and to

fight alongside of the Chinese i: their units.

The cormando units overcame

many difficulties and produced outstanding results during their service

In Chira.

This hoadquerters has cooriinated nost of its work with these units

through Colorel Williaz R. Peers, Colonel William P. Davis,

and It. Colonel

Alfred T. Cox.

All three of these officers have proven to te especially

competent, cooperative, and cutstarding for cormon sense and judgesent.

Because cf their efforts, many c! the difficulties which are inherent in

coordineting military operations which arc roved fron the channel of

military commend bate never ever arisen.

WASHINGTON 25, DE

12 July 1946

SUBJECT: Captain Lucien Conel

TO

8 Mr, Richard Felns

1. Reference is nade to your reuisition dated la June 1946,

requesting a Liaison and coricting Officer for inzon.

Such request

was made by Lleutenant Colonel Inbler, Executive Officer. Furtter

reference is nade to corres-enderce fru jolonel lubler dated 19

June 1946, under mich he suggests that captain Lucien Conein

presently assigned as less and Club Officer, be detailed to fill the

above request.

2. Captain Conein was reassigned to Amzon at tbe insistence

of high echelon Har Departsent authorities.

Then serving his first

tour of duty in ETO, Captain Conein becare involved with the danghter

of the editor of one of the leading De Ga-llist publications. The

matter apparently was a sericus one for jen Captain Conein was

eturned to the United States, rench officials contacted United States

Corerument autrorities i= Sachington, ealling to thair attention the

relationship which had previcly existed between Sagtain Coneir and

the aforementioned girl.

Recasse of this situation, sul was directed

to return Captain Conein in an Inocuous position to sto for the pur

poses of settling nis persoral affairs vita tre aforementioned girl.

3. The suggestion of Colorel Kubler that Captain Conein be used

as Liaison and Conductirg Officer has been thoroughly discussed in

Personel Branch and with Security Branck.

It is their unaninous

opinion that the choice of Jartain Conein to I11l this resuisition

would be unise.

Because of his past history of persoral relationships

with high French officials, and because of the fact that Captain Conein

18 supposed to cceupy an inconspicuous position, it is deened aivisable

that be remain in his presen: position axi not be transferred to a

position where be night subject the organization to criticism and

censure.
