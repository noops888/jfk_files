CG 92-906

DETAILS:

AT CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

CG T-6 has advised as follows:

JFK baW.

11(a)

the North Park

Hotel, 1931 North Lincoln Parkway, Chicago, is a close

associate of GUS ZAPAS and JAMES HOFFA.

SANDY SMITH, POlice Reporter, "Chicago Tribune,"

has advised that BARNEY BAKER is a known slugger for the

Teamsters Union who is presently appealing a recent conviction

for violation of the Anti-Racketeering Statute in Pennsylvania.

CG T-8 advised on September 18, 1961, that JOE

NICOLETTI, who resides in the vicinity of 5700

West Madison

Street, Chicago, has plans to take over the Machinery Movers

Union after ERNIE GIBAS goes to prison on a conviction in

Federal Court in connection with "labor racketeering."

CHARLES

LA TOUR, according to this source, also has

plans to "take over" this

union, but NICOLETTI has stronger

backing from the "outfit."

NICOLETTI testified for TONY

ACCARDO in the latter's income tax trial and as a result,

NICOLETTI was indicted for perjury.

If NICOLETTI goes to

jail in connection with that indictment, LA TOUR will then

be able to "take over" the union, according to the source,

or if NICOLETTI is not convicted, both LA TOUR and NICOLETTI

will run the union.

ERNIC

On October

31, 1961, Assistant United States Attorney

JOHN P. LULINSKI advised SA C. LEONARD TREVIRANUS that appeal

briefs on behalf of ERNEST GIBAS, MICHAEL BYRNE, and DONALD

FULTON. in connection with their conviction, November 22, 1960,

for Violation of the Taft-Hartley Act, were filed on October

23, 1961.

The Federal Government has thirty days in which to

reply thereto.

On November 21, 1961, Assistant United States Attorney

RAYMOND K. BERG advised SA TREVIRANUS that the perjury trial

Of JOSEPH NICOLETTI was scheduled for December 4, 1961, and

insofar as he knew, the trial would proceed as scheduled.
