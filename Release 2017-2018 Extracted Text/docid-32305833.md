COSA NOSTRA

AR - CONSPIRACY

MM 1231-C-TE reported that PAUL VARIO, Capo

in the LUCHESE Family, LCN, arrived in Miami on April 16,

1968, and checked into the

Beachcomber Motel, Miami Beach,

under the name of RUBENSTEIN. Two days later, he left the

Beachcomber and registered into the Dunes Motel, Miami Beach.

VARIO departed Miami on April 20, 1968, and returned to

Miami on April 22, 1968, and is staying at the Dunes as

of April 24, 1968.

He will return to New York momentarily.

While in Miami, VARIO has been in contact with MIKE SABELLA,

ETTORE COCO, JAMES PLUMERI, and the informant.

Informant

states that MIKE SABELLA,

who had previously defected from

the BONANNO Family and had joined VARIO, has returned to

the BONANNO Family after the last series of killings in

New York City, especially that of MICHAEL CONSOLO,

described by the informant as one of SABELLA's closest

associates.

As a result of SABELLA's re-canting, he

and VARIO had a falling out, but the past series of visits

by VARIO to Miami has

brought them back together. VARIO

states that instead of a "council of war" as planned at

the VARIO Long Island residence in May or June, the meeting

will concern itself with making peace between BONANNO and

the other

factions.
