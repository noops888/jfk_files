Havana) which was constructed and planned when the tunnel which crosses

Havana Dey was bullt are Inhabited by Russians and Coche (the latter

in lesser numbera than the Russians). Thie district was planned for

wall-to-do people and the houses tild are of the best quality.

In Favana Province, the Russian camps are located in the surrounding

aress of the towns known as lajay and El Cano.

Cubans are forbidden to

"tranoit through these towns (and) were removed fron living there in

favor of the Russian officials. In the surroundings are located michine

guns and antiaircraft guns in a large number.
