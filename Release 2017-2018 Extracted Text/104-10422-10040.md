Attached is a request from the

National Archives and Records

Center for a review of all CIA

documents held in the Warren

Commission records. DDO/FIO

asked whether CI Staff was the

appropriate component to under-

take the review.

At the time,

as I recall, Mr. Hartman and

Mr. Crooks were transferring

responsibility for much of the

Cs records holding on Oswald

to SE and LA. I do not know

what the answer should be to

Mr. Randall's query.

(I apologize

once again for an item which was

unduly delayed.)
