REFERENCE: UNMA 3798, dated 2S March 1967

DOC. MICKO. SER.

When Wallace

A. G8OVERY met with AMBIDDY/1 on 13 January

to formally terminate the AlMORLD operation, AMBIDDY/1

discussed in detail roference dependents who had

been receiving

financial assistance fron AMORLD funds and requested that

GROWERY explore the possibility of MOFACT financial assistance

following tormination of their AWORLD monthly support payments.

An investigation was conducted by both JWAVE and Headquartors to

determine If the agents naned by AMBIDDY/l had been emplojed by

WOFACT. In order to determine what, if any, obligation might

oxist to provide financial assistance to the dependents.

results of the combined Headquarters investigation, keyed to

roference dependents, are sumarized below for statton

information.

(IDEN • A):

Subijoct was a SOFACT agent undor contract.

MOC provided payment of his $400 monthly salary to.

his dependent mrents for two years following pos-

sible death while engaged on a WOFACT mission.

After Subject's execution in 1962 the parents received

his regular monthly salary until 28 June 1963.

that time Headquarters docided to liquidate the

remaining balance of $6400 and paid this amount in a

lump sum to the parents.

Headquarters considers that

all legal and surai dviigations have been discharged

and is not inclined to assume any further financial

obligations to the parents.

AMBIDDY/1 is apparently

unaware that the parents have received approximately

$10,000 {го HOFACT.

son sentence.

With this information traces

Since neither

JMWAVE nor Headquarters

any evidence

Subject had ever been

exists to provido financial assistance to IDEN B.

Although reference indicates the discusaion between Jamos

OF DEFENDENTS' SUPPORT CLAIMS.

2. IN VIEW OF. THE GOOU MOSSICILITY HEADQUARTERS WILL BE

ABLE TO TRANSFER ALL, OR A LARGE PART, CF THESE SURVIROR BENEFIT

PAYMENTS TO BEC, IT IS REQUESTED THAT AMTIKI REVIEW ALL CASE

FILES PERTAINING TO THE MEMBERS OF THE MERCES/MARTYRS GROUP

WHOSE DEPENDENTS ARE PRESENTLY RECEIVING MONTHLY SUFFERT PAYMENTS.

IN THE EVENT THE FILES-DO NOT CONTAIN THE REQUIRED TYPE OF LEGAL

DOCUMENTS, ANTIKI SHOULD REQUEST COPIES OF ALL SUCH AVAILABLE

DOCUMENTS FROM THE DEPENDENTS, SINCE DOCUMENTS CONCERDING

MARRIAGE, BIRTHS AND BAPTISMS ARE CUSTOMARILY CHERISHED AND

RETAINED BY FAMILIES, THERE APPEARS TO BE.

AN EXCELLENT CHANCE

THAT THEY CAN BE OBTAINED. IT IS PROBABLE THAT A SIMILAR

In accordance with Chief of Station, JNWAVE and Stefan R.

LABANON's telephone conversation on 25 January 1967, we do not plan

to take the action requested in the: References prior to Headquarters

reconsideration of the cases, based on taformation obtatned from

further review of our récords.

Manuel GUILLOT Castellanos (201-281397)•

With reference to

paragraph 2,A: of Reference Beg

it 1s recommended that Headquarters

consider the following points in favor of the JWAVE proposal

that no

further obligation exists to the dependents of Subject and that

payments should not be resumed.

Financial: The l March 1901 MOC established a monthly

salary of $200:00 per month, payable to GUILLOT's parents during

the time he was in Cuba, The 31 October 1961 amendment to the

NOC provided for a Salary of $400.00 per month, payable to

'GUILLOT'S parents during the time he was in Cuba.

Further, the

Noc provided for 2 jears payment of salary

to the parents from

the date of death if due, to operattonal activities.

(Executed

30 August 1962) The Us April 1962 amendment to the MOC provided

for a bonus of up to $750.00 per year if approved by the COS,

Headquarters approval (UFGS-2992, 19 April 1963) the amount of

$6/400,00 was accepted by them as the final settlement.

This

settlement represented monthly payment projected to 30 August

1964

There is no record of payments to dependents

other than

the

parats.

It is believed that the financial settlement is in

accordance

with current AWAVE policy for the handling of agent

death benefits. (JIWAVE Instruction 20-50).

In order to subait accurate figures for the approved actury

study we hust immediatoly estabilah some definite criteria for survivor

payments in the event the principal dependent in terminated for cause.

2o. I find it difficult to accept the inheritance formula that JAVE

says has been SOP, 1. when the first dependent is torninated the second

dependent inherits the firet dependent's share and so un down the line.

In the first place, the Station hasn't been consistent in following thie

-procedure and

the fact it was originally established by ABUD is no reason

for us to continue it. Regardless of the background for thia unrealiotio

procedure it seens that the whole matter is now at a point where policy

governing suture payments should be determined at the Feadquarters leval

and the actuary study can't be started until io supply firm figures that-

are not subject to a variety of changes over the years. Furthermore, the

Station vlevs and clarification of the background leading to the present:

procedure, which was requested over a wook ago, has not been forthconing.

3, I think we can live with the following formula as it lan't

too inconsistent with ESC survivorship provisions. I discussed the following

wịth [

and realistic if you concur.

who agreed the provistons seaned to be thoroughly practical

In those cases where the parents are the sole beneficiaries, in the

event one dies the survivor will be paid the larger of the two

payments aou received, which would be 3175 instead of the $225

now recalved by both of them.

(b)

When a widov dies of remarries, her payront will be divided

equally arong the surviving minor children in lieu of the graduated

paypents they are not receiving. This nay cost un a little more than

Just: lopping off the widow'e share and contimuing the amounts

presentiy paid to the children but we will nininize possible

oK.

repercussions fron the widow if she is still alive and remarried.

It 1s also zuch sore equitable to the children tleaselves to share and

share allke in the event the mother dies. An additional provision

should be that as each cliild reaches 21

or marries, his paynent will

be terrinated, exceut. in those cases where a child is physically or

mentally Incapacitated for life. In such cases the child will be

paid for life.

In arsver to any possible statie over these provisions we can always

fall back on the originall

He stated that the payments to the dependents of the

which ordon in effect stated that the payments vere to be mado

until rescindod by the Presidont.

Since that time, the Arency

dependents of the Brigade with the balance being dependents of the

Jeros and Martyrs Group and ccrtain. Carcia Line crewmen.

The

individuals arc presently pald through a cover firm with no of

1ictal Coycinment attribution.

It is Sll Division's position that

since this progran must be continued until terminated by the

President, it is a long range,

overall Agency obligation which

hould not be budgeted for nor administered by ll Division.

The

Division rould like

to transfor total responsibility for the pro-

fran to Project WUMUSUAl by a single premium pürchase of annuities.

If the single prentum method is

too costly, they would still like

to have the responsibility transferred eithor by an installment

Purchase "ol' by the funding method.

NI. Evans advised

the Committee

that he felt the matter should be brought to the attention of the

Committce before WUMUTUAL secured actuarial calculations, since the

subtracts from his economic efforts. Artime noted that assets to make

these raids are available but are not boing used. Ho did not specifically

ask for support to reiumo hie activitios.

I told him that while his arguments had certain merit, thore were also

other considerations which should bo kept in mind, l.a., that hit-and-sun

ralde provido a pretec for Castro to turn the acrews of repression harder

on the Cuban people and to place the blame for hle own fallure on external

attacks. Artime acknowledged the validity of these arguments and did not

pursue the matter further.

Artiine said that he had reached the point where he had to think of finding

a job to support his wife and three children.

Ho indicated a preference

for a job that would permit him to travel throughout Latin America so

that he could maintain his contacts in other countrles, and asked that

The pest of our conversation ranged ovar a series öf points -- Cubela.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH/Cuba

SUBJECT

Recommendations Concerning Paymerits to

Dependents of Brigade Members

1.

A review of the existing files fails to reveal

any evidence of a clear-cut policy concerning the duration

öf payments to dependents of Brigade members killed,

captured

or missing in action despite the many recommenda

tions made. at various times to resolve this problen.

This

lack of policy is implicit in & memorandum from Mr. Helms

to the DDCI dated 23 May

1962 in which he referred to a

Presidential oral

directive that payments to dependents

were to be continued until termination by Presidential

order.

A later memorandum from Mr. Helms to the Doc!, dated

31 December 1962, contained recommendations for terminating

these monthly payments with a lump sum death payment to

be made to dependents of those killed or missing in action.

Both memoranda are attached for your review.. A memprandum

from Mr. Sterling Cottrell to the Attorney General, dated

1 February 1963, concerning varlous agreements reached

between Brigade leaders, AUBUD and the Agency, also included

three possible alternatives for resolving the problem of

dependency payments as follows:

Follow regulations established by the Bureau

of Employment Compensation, 1.e. $1,000 lump sum payment

for loss of life.

B.

Follow U.S. Army practice, i.e. monthly

payments of $122 or more (depending on rank

service) for as long as the widow survives and does

not re-marry.

ng t the that

and

length

This, Mr. Cottrell pointed out,

would be a

costly program to administer and would cost roughly $300,000

a year

for an indefinite period. (This has proven to be

true):

## Page 147

A lump sim arbitrary payment of $3,000 which

(250 per

2.

Obviously. the above rocommendations as well as

others proposed at various timos in an effort to terminate

this costly exercise were never acted on and due to the

timo lag are probably no longor practical.

Tentative

approaches to the probien were also made by exploring the

possibility of working out some mechanism by which HEW could

take over disbursements

at a roduced rate and perlodic

rulings and guidance were requestod from the General

Counsel concerning the legal and securlly factors inherent

in the proposals.

3..

When the original cover mechanism ins

cstablished

for disbursing these

payments. the dependents

were apparently

advised that such payments

would continue

as long ns funds

woro available.

In view of the indefinite time stipula

tion together with

the long-standing demise of tho AMBUD

organtention and its relationship to this program, dependents

could reasonably be expected to philosophically accopt tho

fact that these funds have finally boen exhausted.

In the

light of similar past experiencos, some carping and pro-

tosts

from dissident's

can bo ahticipated with the usual

sccurity hazards whenever the decision is made to terminate

this project. These possibilitios can hardly justify the

indefinite continuation of this enormous expenditure of

funds which to date

amounts to approximately $2,000,000.00.

Any question that may arise is to who has really been foot

ing this bill is unlikely to cause any shock to the publie

at.

large after being deluged with roams öf Cuban postmortems.

4.

The revier and recommendations forwarded by JMWAVE

are comprehensive and appear to be more than generous in

the approach toward a two-stage cut-off of payments.

I.

do believe the recommendations to immediately cease any

further payments to trustees should be submitted to the.

General Counsel for a ruling on the legal technicalities

involved in such a step. This may also apply to any

attempt to remove existing funds

from

trustees who are con

sidered to be unreliable or ever dishonest in the administra

tion of funds under this control.

These

trustees were

specifically. designated by Brigade members

and the vritten

authorization to support such trusteeships are in the

custody of ANTIKI. It would seem that no one but the

---

## Page 148

-3-

principal himsolf or his heirs has the legal right to

revoke a trustccship even in the mishandling

of lunds.

Based on a revicw of pertinent documents and i discussion

with

who is probably more knowledgeable

of the facts and nuances of this problem than anyono else,

I have listed bolow some recommendations for your con-

sideration;

In line with recent JUWAVE rocommendations,,

payments to all principal dependents (wivos who have not

remarried) be reduced by 30 July, or as. soon as fensible,

to i flat $100 por month and all minor dependents reducod

to. $25 per month with

notification that all payments will

coaso 6 months fron date of initial reduction.

All secundary

depondents, such

as dependent parents who reccive separnte

checks of not more than $50 por. month, should be continuod

at the present rato until tho final termination dato for

all dependents.

B.

Such adjustments as recommonded

above should

bo uniform and across

the board with no

attempt to

evaluate

each case on an individual basis determined by

such factors as outside income, need, etc.

This would

not only tend to creato an undesirable socurity hazard but

would complicate the phasing out of an alrcady complicatod

situation.

Furthermore, individuals who have made an

effort to raise their standard of living by augmentation

of their income would be justified in fcoling they wore

penalized for having nore ambition than some of the lazy

Once we attempt to play the role of

solomon as to who is the most worthy or the most noody,

we lose sight of the fact that all dependents are oqual

as widows whose husbands died for the same cause and we

could expect: no end of recriminations..

Neither should

there be any distinction as is recommended in somo instancos

by JMWAVE that payments should cease because dependonts

happen to reside in Cuba:

They are as entitled to the

samo benefits as those fortunate enough to reside in this

country.

The exception

to this may be justified in those.

paychological point of view and remove any possibility of

Furthermore, the memorandum from Mr. Cottroll to the

Prior to submitting recommendations to the

on all the logal and possible security aspects of any
