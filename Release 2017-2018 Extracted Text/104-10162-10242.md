1. We have kept you up to dite on ARGOOR's sudden move and the

subsequent termination of AELANYARD.

at the fresent time, we still

do not know whether or not the story of a sudden transfer

was in reality the basis for the move or 1f a compromise of the

operation was the actual cause.

As wo pointed out in our criginal

eable, our immediate thought was that perhape the L

had caused all AEKICK types to "pull in" and that perhaps ABBOOR

was simply following orders.

Subsequent investigation, hower,

tended to discredit this thought.

The ARANYARD transcripta reveal that AlsoOR did indeed

contempinte the move soveral days before we actually had wind of st.

His wife eld rut like the ides and complained to him about the

move.. AMOOR alno told his landlord in advance of his move.

18 also ovidence that MEBOOR was in somewhat regular contact with

mbanny and although we were not certain, it appeared

that ne war anxious to learn 1f his vian had been granted.

may came, on 38 Beptember 1969, ABBOOR and wife checked out of

their apartment.

Shortly thereafter, we mada a phyleal cheok of the intertor

of the apartment.

Everything seemed

to bo in otdor.

Thore was no

evidence whatsoever that the technioal and of the operation had

been tampered with.

An we said bofore, It funstioned up until and

We have not beer able as yet to establish direct social

contact with AEBOOR. Both Nina T. MARGANUE and Paud W. LEVERONE

(who tavo logitimate roason to seek him out) have tried, but to

date, to no avail. Ou* hope has been to have AFBOOR actually tell

us of his plans - will he indeed be transforred

original thought was that the

could readily determine

if he had indeed applied for a visa to that country.

As you know,

we struck out here also.

The fact 1g that as of this writing, we do not know

whether AEBOOR's move was routine and innocent or if indeed there

was monothing Bindatos ancolved.

If AEROOR does Indend pick up

and move

we shall, of courss, be somewhat relieved.

However, this will not answer categorically the major question -

was tho

operation comprouised?

It would appear that regardless of

what happens to AEBOOR, we shall never know

tho actual reason for

nie move.

However, for what it is worth, the evidence here does

not point toward a compromise.

The detalled analysis of the Station's operational

operational opportunities and was waiting for the FISTEALthe

up

the first sovial contact (experience has shown that the

FJSTEALers heis will not take the initiative and must be

ectively pursued) but a number of conversations (boch face

to face and by phone)

ended up in the vague promise on the

part nt subject that

"He must get together goon"

'. In the

Interim the Station tightened the coverage of AEBOOR Ly

Rutting AELANIARD on a 24 hour-a-day basis for a little over

two weeks and by conducting full coverage surveillance for

about one week.

Our reasoning behind this acting wis as fol-

lows. such intensive covarage would possibiy fermit us to

spot a likaly place where

we could inject an access agent:

It would give us a better "feel" of his daily activity; 1t

might uncover one or more of his clandestine contacts.

The

results of the effort, while far from solving our problems,

did give us a wealth of information which should help us in

our operational planning-once AEBOOR returns to his station.
