of income is the wide-spread concession he has at numerous

race

tracks throughout the country, primarily in Florida and

New Jersey but including the Fairgrounds in New Orleans, for the

seat cushions.

Informant stated the geats are fixed with s

wenty-five cent slot, which, Ior that price, wilt release e

seat cushion,

this device being extremely lucrative: and Whi_â‚¬

MeLANEY is not believed to own the concession, he has control

at some of the main tracks in the country.

Informant related that he has not seen MeLANEY personally for

a number of years but lat spoke with him some two months ago,

at which time the conversation was by radio-telephone, MCLANEY

being at sea in his yacht. McLANEY at that time related the trouble

he has been having in Cuba and wants desparately to unload,

claiming that it is now impossible to do business in Cuba due

to the many regulations being put out.

Informant feels that

MCLANEY is the front man for TOPPING and WEBB and feels that they

have an interest in the entire Hotel Nacional in Havana, not

just the gambling concession. He stated that this is the nature

of MeLANEY's connections, always with better-class persons,

wealthy and independent of any mob control, and he has never

been

known to have been involved in any violence, extortion or

trouble of any kind, although he has always

been an inveterate

gambler and bets very heavily on any type of sporting venture.

Informant advised that he knows of only one other member of the

family, a brother, WILLIAM MCLANEY who is supposed to be looking

after the business in havana, another person who

any criminal connections that informant knows of.

He stated

that McLANEY would be a man of about forty-five years of age

at this time, is married to a wealthy girl from Philadelphia

to have any family ties in New Orleans any more.
