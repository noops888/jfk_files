AMMUG-1 apparently took the news as well as could

we may keep him informed on any progress.

stages of the revolution, states that he deloted an

the father's dossier (showing

he paid oll the police to run his bolita operation)

and thus saved his from prosecution.

g.

AMMUG-l continued to be close to the family,

especially

with

Roberto,

"whom I say every day and

ran around vith."

Roberto nover entertained the

revolution.

AB

late as 1962-63, "He used to talk

quite openly and frankly.

He was alvays against the

revolution and

the communists.

He worked in the

Ministry of Industry because his brother got him the

job,

but he had only one

1dea in his head:

to get out

of Cuba and come to the US.

He was even plotting to

get out by boat.

He had a US visa for many years and

had visited hare many tines."

b.

When AlßUG-l defected, he lost contact with

Roberto.

DETAILED JUSTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT

1.

Agency

Vladimir RODRIGUEZ LaHera has cooperated with this

since his dejection on 21 April 1964

turned over to CIA documents from the Gencral Directorate of

Intelligence he had collected during the preceeding several

months.

In addition, he has provided voluminous, accurate

and valuable information on

the organization of the Cuban

intelligence services, their operations,

staff members and

agents.

These documents and information have given us the

potential and opportunity to

take effective measures to

safesuard United States Gorernment interosts.

Subject has

been of gicat value in the past,

and will continue

to be in

the tuture,

in the CIA recruitment/defcction program.

His

wide acquaintance

among and knowledge concorning high level

Cuban diplomats

and Cuban intelligence personnel provides

the Agency with the necessary background in planning operations

against them and

makes Subjeet ideal

for use in carrying out

the operations.

His talents

and contacts can be used not only

in furthering

the detector

program,

but in other types of

political action and

psychological warfare opcrations.

As a result of technical interrogations of RODRIGUEZ

on 11 May 1964 and again on 15 July 1966, his hona tides have

been established not only for intelligence exploitation

purposes but also for the purpose of resettlement in the

United States.

There is no reason to believe that RODRIGUEZ
