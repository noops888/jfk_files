information that Lee Stephens had moved out of her apartment, January 1

1954 because one Marilyn Durand, her former roommate had previously

vacated the premises and Stephens could no longer afford the apartment

which rented for $450.00 per month. The mamager stated that to the best

of his knowledge Stephens was never legitimately employed, but that she

was engaged in prostitution. He stated further that she and her room mate

were "part of a call girl ring" operated by "unknown madame". Stephens

had also been the subject of investigation by another federal investigative

agency since approximately January 1, 1963. This investigation, accord-

ing to the manager was not so much concerned with her activities as a

prostitute, but with her "political and social connections." The manager

further stated that this federal investigative agency had placed an audio-

surveillance device in her apartment with his knowledge and consent. He

had also furnished information from time to time to this agency concerning

her activities.

JARK LANE - PHYLLIS DENISE GOLDIN

(OBSCENE)

A confidential source having knowledge of the Queen's District Attorney's

office furnished the above named investigators with a copy of an affidavit

for review only, made by one Phyllis Denise Golden, on January 30, 1962.

Which affidavit was taken in question and answer form by Bernard Patten,

Assistant District Attorney for Queens County, New York. Golden resides

at 104-20 Queens Boulevard, Forest Hills, New

York.

The circumstances leading to the taking of this affidavit involved a bad

check complaint against Hrs. Golden

This complaint was made by Alexander's

Department Store in Forest Hills on December 22, 1961. After the complaint

was made, Investigator Sidney Goldstein of the Queens District Attorneys

office was assigned to serve a supboena upon Mrs. Golden requiring her

appearance on January 30, 1962 in the District Attorney's Office.

The check involved was for $144.77. After the supboena was served on Mrs.

Golden she made statements to the effect that she knew lack Lane, the Assembly-

min and that he would take up the check for her. When Golden becane un~

sucessful in having lane pick up the check, she became bitter and said she

had something to hold over him for the rest of his life, and that the s.o.b.

was responsiblé for her financial predicament, because he had never paid

ner for some office work she had performed for him.

On January 29, 1962 Golden was questioned by Assistant District Attorney

Pation and on

the following day the affidavit from Golden was taken. Extracts

from this affidavit are quoted or quoted in part as follows:

Qo What is it?

A. That was the test that lark handed to me in a sealed envelope on

January 18, 1962.

Qo At your apartment?

Ao Right.

Q. Are you familiar with lark lane's handwriting and printing?

A. Yes.

Q. I ask you in whose handwriting or printing this is?

A. In Mr. Lanes printing.

Now tell'us what tests; so called tests were conducted in ;your apart-

ment on January 18, 1962.

In complete detail, and just what you did and

what lee did, and what Mark did.

A. The first thing was Ir. Lane had his temperature taken. First he un-

dressed himself as far as the shorts were concerned. Then he laid face

down on the bed, and I said "you will have to remove your jockey shorts

too." And he took them down, and in that I assisted him.

After that I

inserted a candle into Mark annaly. After that I tweezed some pubic hair

and then lee beat Mark with his own belt on the buttocks, then pins were

inserted around the annal area and into the testicles.

Then he got an

enema, both of us gave him the enema, I believe I held the-boy and then I

put it in, and then he started to masterbate after the enema was completely

in him, and he wasn't supposed to relieve himself until after he masterbated.

But he claimed he had to relieve himself and he did. And then when Mark

came back into the room the next thing on the instruction sheet was for

hang on the ins

him. to masterbate himself, and at which point he got embarrassed and he.

decided he couldn't do it, and a comment was made by either Miss Stephens

or myself that the tests can't continue unless he does it, so then Lèe

inserted a candle into his anus, and then I believe she beat him again, I

am not positive. Then Lee, having read the instruction sheet with me

suggested the obscene pictures. Before the pictures, the first set of pins

and needles were just regular, so "Lee lit the needles and I put them in,

we both did it."

About this point Golden said lane said it was too embarrassing

for him to masterbate, or something like that, and "Lee asked him' if it

would be easier if she did it. And with that

"she proceeded to masterbate

him."

lo Did he reach a climax?

A. Yes he did, it was at this point that lee suggested taking the picture

and I got the camera.

One of the pictures showed lark lying face down on

the bed with the candle inserted rectally. Another was taken of Lee beating

him.

Another was taken of "r. lane on his stomach not only with a candle

inserted rectally, but also with two stems of

artificial flowers. A fourth

was taken of lee singing his hair around the testicles with a lighted match.

After a few pictures were taken, his hands were tied behind his back and

Miss'lee gave him another enema. She left the room about 6:00 PM and told

Lee she could continue the tests. At one point I heard from another room

what sounded to me like someone being beaten with a belt.

At this point,

Patten asked Golden when she came back into the room and did she see Lee

Stephens.

Qo: Was she dressed or undressed?

A.

She was wearing a two piece suit.. She still had her jacket on and

skirt on, but her skirt was pulled up to her waist and under that she

was nude.

(Didn'; see lane) She said Lee told her what happened.

Q. What did Lee tell you happened?

A. She told me that after I left, that she and liark had been looking at

the pictures that had been taken, and that she inserted the Martini stirrer

into him with the alcohol on it; and that she had beaten him again and that

fir. Lane made advances toward her, and that because she had been aroused

by what happened, she told me she had intercourse with him.

do I show you a photograph and ask you if that is one of the pictures that

you took?

Ao Yest

Q. Who's picture is that?

A. Mark Lane:

Q. And is there another persons hand in the picture?

A. Yes.

Qo Who is that?

A. Lee Stephens.

Elizabeth Lee Stephenson, also known as Lee Stephens gave a statement

The picture mentioned herintofore shows Lane fully unclothed with hand on

his testicles which is that of another person... Lane has part of a black

sash belt on his body and still has has his glasses on.. A copy of this

picture was obtained through extremely confidential means, and is available

only through the Staff Director.

The affidavit taken from Phyllis Goldenwas never signed by her, but was

taker in the presence of a witness. On the night the affidavit was taken

Mrs. Golden had her baby with her, and it was agreed that she could take

She baby home because it was crying.

Rather than have her wait until the

affidavit was typed up by the reporter.

Prior to the time Golden was to

appear in the District Attorneys Office to sign the affidavit, she called

Detective Goldstein of the District Attorneys office on the night öf i

January 31, 1962 and advised him that Mark lane was coming to her apartment

and that she feared bodily harm from him.

On this night Detective Goldstein

went to the Golden apartment and secreted himself in a closet.:. However a

noise gave him away, and lane left the Golden apartment without making any

statements of a threatening nature. However it is believed by those con-

cerned that Golden was frightened into signing an affidavit for lane, re-

futing the statements made by her to Assistant District Attorney Patten.

This affidavit was dated February l, 1962, and was a handwritten document

and witnessed by Stanley Geller and Norman Dorsen.

Both alledged professors

at New York University:

This statement contained

seven points of dispute

botwoen the statement made to Mr. Patten and the denials made by Hrs. Golden.

A low of these points as follows:

1. Golden olaimed that Detootive Goldotein asled her 1d she knew Mark Lane

after he told her of the charges made by Alexanders Department Store.

Detective Sidney Goldstein and Walter R. Anderson of the Queens District

Attorney's office state that Goldstein handed Phyllis Golden a supboena

on January 23, 1961, returnable January 3, 1962, that Goldstein advised

Golden it was for a bad check for $144.77 made out to Alexanders Depart-

ment Store, which was returned by the bank upon which drawn, marked "no

account. at this bank.!!

Goldstein further states that Phyllis Golden told

him sh. was Secretary for lark lane and that lane was obligated to her for

the rest of his life.

And that she would get money. from him to take up

the check.

Golden claimed she received a telephone call from Goldstein asking

her to come down to the District Attorney's office, and that on the same

day she received a telegram requesting her to dome down to the District

Attorney's office.

Goldstein and Anderson state that this is true but that this matter per-

tained to other bad check cases being handled by Assistant District Attorney

William T. Garvin:

Goldstein said that he did not bother her since he had served her with a

supboena.

3. Point three is covered in part by above one and two.

4. Golden states that she was handed a yellow sheet of paper, and asked

to identify Mark lanes signature, she claimed in her own affidavit, that

she did not know then, (January 30, 1962) and does not now, (February 5,

1962) know whether it was Mark Lanes handwriting

Detective Anderson and Goldstein state that point four is not true. That

actually "at her placell, that Detective Investigator W. R. Anderson, in

the presence of Sidney Goldstein, Detective Investigator, was given a yellow

piece of paper with handwriting on it on January 24, 1952 by Mrs. Golden

at 6:05 PM which contained la series of instructions to be imposed upon

the person of Mark lane," which was in the handwriting of Mark Lane.

But

she irs. Golden told them, Anderson and Goldstein that she knew Mark Lane's

handwriting since whe was his Secretary.

5.

Mrs. Golden said she never saw the handwriting (Mark Lane's) before it

was

shown to her in the District Attorney's office,

and that she never par-

ticipated in any such tests with Mark lane as described by the yellow piece

of paper.

Detectives Goldstein and Anderson state that this isn't true, that on the

date of January 2, 1962 when Krs. Golden turned over the yellow instruction

shcet to them, Detective Anderson received a picture of a nude male from

Irs. Golden, which depicted a man lying in bed with a hand, not his own,

placed near his private parts. And that the picture according to Mrs.

Golden, was that of lark lane the New York Assemblyman.

Krs. Colden also told them that she took the picture with a polaroid camera

and explained that the hand shown in

the picture was that of her girlfriend.

That the picture was evidence that lark Lane is a masochist, and that she

"was keeping the picture as evidence:"

Mrs. Golden also told Detectives in answer to questions, that Lee Stephens

had never seen Mark lane before the events described herein occurred. When

the Detectives asked lirs. Golden how it was that Lee Stephens, her girl

friend would participate in such acts, she said, "Lane is a very convincing

talker." And claimed that he had received the instruction sheet from a

psychiatrist or psychologist friend who wanted to experiment and find out

how much pain a human being could endure. Golden also told the detectives

that on January 24, 1962 that both she and Stephens participated in the

acts performed upon Lane.

6. Yrs. Golden claimed that she was told by the District Attorney's

office not to discuss the case with anyone and that therefore she did not

call an attorney.

Detective Goldstein stated that he and police woman

Helen Pastore were present in It. Roches office when Phyllis said she had

to call an attorney in Albany.

Moe Weinstein, which she did. However she

did not discuss the lark lane case, but did discuss a personal matter with

Weinstein.

7. I'rs, Colden claimed that on the night of January 31, 1962 Detective

Goldsteir: requested her to ask Mark Lane questions or to get Lane to say.

things that would bear out

the story she had told Mr. Patten.

Detective Goldstein stated that this was untrue and that this was the night

she called him and told him that since Lane was coming to her apartment

she feared bodily injury. Detective Goldstein was present in Mrs. Goldens

for her protection.

Assistant District Attorney Bernard Patten interviewed Lane after the case

broke. During the interview Lane admitted he knew Phyllis Golden and

had known her for a "couple of years," as she had worked for him, but not

on salary.

That he had represented her as an attorney; that she had worked

for him during his campaigns; that she had gone to Albany four or five

times and performed secretarial work for him. That he did

not know whether

she had ever visited him at home, but he would not answer to whether ha

had ever visited Golden's home, unless he was apprised of the charges against

him. Lane denied that he had ever engaged in sex deviations with Mrs.

Golden, but said that he did have friends that were psychiatrists and psy-

chologists. However he did not recall ever having an arrangement whereby

he would conduct tests for them. He named one psychologist friend as

Fred llahn of New York City.

Lane admitted he knew Phyllis Golden on Queens Boulevard, but refused to

say whether he had visited the Golden apartment on January 18, 1962. Lane

complained to Patten that the press had called him about the investigation

and clained that he knew that Assembly Speaker Carlino was making an in-

vestigation of him for alledged sex deviation.

Lane upon being confronted with the nude picture made by Mrs. Golden denied

that it-was he that was depicted in the picture. Lane admitted that he had

seen Phyllis several weeks before the day of the interrogation by Patten:

'After' i he affidavit submitted by lirs. Golden on behalf of lark Lane, was

• received by District Attorney Patten he made a trip to Florida and took

another affidavit from Lee Stephens. At this time Stephens was vacation-

ing and working in litani as a photographer on the Calypso, a tour boat

which runs from Bimini and Miami daily.

Her residence in Florida was

2115 Bay Drive, Normandy Isle, Florida where she was staying with one

Helen Sansouct.

This second affidavit dealt with her testimony before the Queens County

Grand Jury on February 1, 1962 relative to certain imnoral and perverted

activities between herself, Phyllis Golden and one lark Lane. Stated

substantially as follows;

Lee Strphens had not seen Phyllis Golden since the day of the Grand Jury

hearing, (February 1, 1962). She Identified Golden as having testified

on that day. (see other notes.) Golden had telephoned Lee Stephens room

of Lee Stephens. Patten showed Lee Stephens a photostat of a contradictory

affadavit made by Golden on February 5, 1962, attested to by one Stanley

Geller. (Notory Public New York).

And Norman Dorsen, both alledged

professors of law at New York University. Lee Stephens, and we show the

back sheet of this affidavit, lee Stephens stated that Golden perjured

herself in regarding her contradictory testimony in the affidavit of

February 5, 1962 because on February 1, 1962 while both women were waiting

to testify before the Grand Jury, Golden told Stephens that lane told

Golden, "Phyllis, not only is my political career finished but my life is

finished." Golden was afraid of her, own safety and/or lane might try to

kill himself.

Lee Stephens sald that Goldens statements regarding the tests made by the

three named individuals on January 18; 1962 in her February 5, affidavit

were false, and the testimony before the Grand Jury on February 1,1962

were true.

Les stephens stated she did not know If Golden was paid money to sign the

affidavit of February 5, 1962.

Lee Stephens stated she had never met or had contact with lane prior to

January 18, 1962. But did know of his political reputation and knew of

hin through Golden. Lee Stephens said she consented to participate in

the "tests" at the request of Golden, bocause she was curious.

That Lee

Stephens did not receive money for it. (Golden had obviously related stories

of previous tests to Lee Stephens.)

Lee Stephens related the events which occurred on Jánuary 18, 1962 sub-

stantially as follows:

She arrived at Goldens apartment 104-20 Queena Boulevard, and Golden was

not feoling well and was in bed. At that time Lee Stephens found out.

Lane was coming and had not yet arrived. When Lane arrived Lee Stephens

Lee Stephens left them alone in the bedroom for approximately 45 minutes,

after which time Golden came out of the bedroom and produced a yellow

slip of paper on which the tests were written, and asked Lee, Stephens if

Lee Stephens consented. Lee Stephens

to the contents of the test,

either prior,

during or after the tests. During the tests Golden took the pictures.

She stated that ten pictures in all were taken of him in humiliating poses.

And all were shown to lane with the exception of the one that was later

trined over to the police.

Lane took the other pictures with hir.

In

the photo she identified the point of the pin actually in his testicles,

and also the black belt used to tie his hands behind his back. With

further reference to the Golden affidavit, in behalf of lane, it should

be mentioned that Golden admitted initialing the police exhibits beyond

instructions she stated further, but said at the time she did so she was

confused, in a highly nervous state and physically ill.

A report submitted by conmittee investigator Phillip R. Manuel on larch 15,

1962 contains information regarding the results of the interview conducted

with Lee Stephens by Investigator Manuel and Louis J. Russell.

This report

reflects that Miss Stephens confirms her affidavits in detail during the

intervi w with her. Kiss Stephens appears to be definitely opposed to

Left wing activities, and the current and past activities of lark Lane.

Assistant District Attorney Bernard Patten advised that he knows Lee

Stephens is a prostitute, which she admits. He also said he believes her

to be entirely truthful despite her occupation.

He also

advised that

his office was severely castigated by Louis Kaplan, who at the time of the

Lane-Golden incident, was Investigation Commissioner of the City of New

York. This censure came about, because Kaplan, according to Patten, was

trying to rule the Reform Democrats because he intended to run for public

office. Kaplan is now a judge in New York City, and was appointed by

Mayor Waggoner, despite bitter opposition from the New York Bar Association.
