(C) CUBAN INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES - EFFORTS

TO RECRUIT CUBAN REFUGEES TO GATHER INTELLIGENCE INFORMA-

TION - During recent months, a number of Cuban refugees residing in the

United States have received unsolicited mimeographed letters which requested

the addressee to cooperate with the Cuban Government by gathering information

of an intelligence nature which the addressee was requested to furnish to the

Cubans by means of secret-writing letter. All of the letters received by the

refugees to date have been postmarked at New York City and the sender has

utilized fictitious names although a number of the return addresses utilized

actually exist.

The above mineographed letter sets forth an accommodation

address in Cuba to be utilized by the addressee as well as detailed information

concerning the preparation and mailing of secret-writing letters to the

accommodation address.

In most cases, the recipients of these letters have recently been

in contact with Cuban authorities regarding permission to visit Cuba or other

matters requiring action by a Cuban Government agency. The FBI Laboratory

has determined that all mimeographed letters received to date were prepared

on the same mimeograph machine and investigation is being conducted in an

effort to identify the person or persons responsible for this activity.

Since it appears that efforts to recruit Cuban refugees for the

purpose of gathering intelligence information on behalf of the Cuban Government

may become widespread, the code name "CUBREC" has been assigned and

communications regarding investigation of the above-described activity should

be so captioned. Bureau file in this matter is 65-69402. Offices receiving

information concerning the above-described activity should promptly bring

this information to the attention of the Bureau and any pertinent material

obtained should be forwarded to the FBI Laboratory for appropriate examination.

(FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times"

newspaper contained a

full-page advertisement captioned

"What is Really Happening In Cuba," placed by the Fair Play

This advertisement announced

FPCC intended to promulgate "the truth about revolutionary

Cuba" to neutralize the distorted American press.

"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961,

reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States

Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1961,

DI. Charles A. Santos-Buch identified himself and Robert

Taber as organizers of the FPCC.

He also testified he and

Taber obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were

applied toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.

On May 16, 1963,

a source advised that during the

first two years of

the FPCC's existence there was a struggle

between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SYP)

elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby

influence FPCC policy.

This source added that during the

past year there had been a successful effort by FPCC leadership

to minimize the role of these and other organizations in the

FPCC so that their influence as of May, 1963,.

was negligible.

The SWP. has been designated pursuant to Executive

Order 10450.

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that

intention of permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any

other organization.

This source stated that Lee believed

that the FPCC should

advocate resumption of diplomatic

relations between Cuba and the United States and should

support the rigat of Lubans to manage thelr revolution

without interference fron other nations. Lee did not

advocate supporting the cuban revolution per se.

The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York

Times" reported that Senator Thomas J. Dodd of Connecticut

had called FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of

the Castro network in the United States."

It is to be noted.

that Senator Dodd was a member of the Senate Internal

Security Subcommittee which twice conducted hearings on

the FPCC.

The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York

World Telegram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro

FPCC was seeking to go out of business and that its prime

activity during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-

and the

direction of an active propaganda mill highlighting illegal

travel-to-Cuba campaigns.

Its comparatively brief span of

life was attributed to mounting anti-Castro American public

opinion, the 1962 Congressional hearings which disclosed

FPCC financing by Castro's United Nations Delegation, and

ultimately, the bad publicity which the FPCC received frOn

disclosure

of activities on its benalf by suspected

presidential assassin Lee H. Oswald.

on february 6,

1964, the previously mentioned

second source advised that i.

T. Lee had recently remarked

that the FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to

organize another similar organization.

On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that

there had not been any FPCC activity in many months and

that the FPCC had been dissolved.

RE: DANIEL LIEBER QUEEN

Daniel Lieber Queen is a member of the Communist

Party in Chicago, Illinois. He has been trained in and is currently

engaged in the electronics field in the Chicago area.

Gus Hall, General Secretary, Communist Party, USA,

has instructed Queen to perfect an instrument which would locate

listening devices and which can be used for the purpose of checking

Party offices and residences of various Party leaders. Queen is

working on such an instrument and has stated that at this stage his

instrument probably will not locate listening devices unless the FBI

has insecurely installed such devices. Queen is continuing to perfect

his instrument and feels he is capable of developing an instrument

which will be able to make a thorough security check of the various

Party offices, meeting places and residences of Party leaders.

The Chicago Office should alert the Bureau and any

interested offices when it is known that Queen will be traveling to

another territory. This matter should be brought to the attention

of appropriate investigative personnel and each office must be

constantly alert for Queen's activities in its area and take necessary

steps to neutralize his effectiveness and protect our sensitive sources

at all times.

PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY

(Utilize the current approved thumbnail sketch set

forth in SAC Letter 65-36 (D), dated June 29, 1965.)

REVULUTIONARY ACTION MOVEMENT

On November 3, 1964, a source made available a

document entitled "The Revolutionary Action Movement Manifesto,"

the document having been obtained by the source from an

individual known to be a member of the Revolutionary Action

This document stated, in part, that RAM was officially

organized in the Winter of 1963 by Afro-Americans who support

the revolutionary objectives of Robert F. Williams, now

residing in Cuba, and his concept of organized violence to

achieve the liberation of the Afro-American people in the

United States. This Manifesto disclosed that RAM had oriented

its program to one of education and political revolution and

the organization of a "black" political party with revolutionary

objectives, having recognized the need for a "black revolution"

that could

and would seize power. RAN philosophy is described

in this document as one of revolutionary nationalism, that is,

one involving the struggles of the nonwhite races of

the world

against exploitation and

enslavement by the white capitalist

and imperialist nations.

Regarding Williams, it should be noted that on

August 28, 1961, a Federal warrant was issued at Charlotte,

North Carolina,

charging him with Unlawful flight to Avoid

Prosecution for the crime of kidnapping. Subsequent to the

issuance of this warrant,

• Williams fled the United States to

Cuba, where he now publishes a monthly newsletter entitled

"The

Crusader" from Havana.

This source in September, 1964, advised RAM is

dedicated to the overthrow of the capitalist system in the

United States, by violence if necessary, and to its replacement

by a socialistic system oriented toward the Chinese communist

interpretation of Marxism-Leninism.

RAM is entirely nonwhite

in membership, clandestine in nature, and owes its primary

allegiance to

the "Bandung World," that is, the nonwhite races

ot the world rather than to any national entity, as such.

in placing the FBI number on fingerprint cards the requirement

to submit a full set of fingerprints, 10 rolled impressions plus

plain impressions of the thumbs and 4 fingers of each hand, is

being rescinded in those instances where the FBI number is placed

on the submitted fingerprint card. Instead of a full set of finger-

prints, only the plain impressions of the 4 fingers of the right hand

need be placed in the proper block on the fingerprint card for

purpose of making a positive identification. The standard arrest

fingerprint card,

form FD-249, should continue to be used. It

copy of record is NOT desired, check block on fingerprint card

provided for this purpose. If copy of record IS desired place such

notation under this block.

Form FD-249 has been revised to

include blocks for both such notations; however, available stocks

• of present form will be used until exhausted.

Since this procedure will eliminate the time-consuming

REPORT (DAMV - FR) - BOMBING MATTERS - THREATS -

FEDERAL TRAIN WRECK STATUTE - CRIME ON THE HIGH

SEAS: -- Recently a number of cases have been reported to the

Bureau under the Bombing Matters - Threats classification that

should have been handled in accordance with existing instructions

covering the DAMV - FR Statute.

You are reminded that the DAMV - FR Statute (18 USC

35) covers not only aircraft. motor vehicles, and their facilities

as mentioned in Chapter 2 of Title 18, but it also covers false

reports relating to violations mentioned in Chapters 97 and 111

of Title 18. Chapter 97 prohibits certain acts in connection

with railroads (Federal Train Wreck Statute). Chapter 111

contains numerous criminal provisions pertaining to shipping

(Crime on the High Seas). The False Report Section of the

DAMV Statute therefore includes all the various transportation

facilities mentioned in Chapters 2, 97, and 111 of Title 18. • •

You should note, for example, that placing a bomb or explosive

on any vessel of the United States, including ships of the U. s.

Navy and Coast Guard, is a violation as set forth in Chapter 111

• (18 USC 2275) and a false report to bomb such ships would

therefore be a violation of the DAMV - False Report Statute.

Bring this to the attention of all investigative

personnel.

(D) DESERTER MATTERS - INTERVIEWS AND CONFESSIONS -

Recent decisions of the U. S. Court of Military Appeals hold that

the Miranda decision applies to questioning for evidence of guilt

in military cases. If a deserter suspect or subject is subjected to

custodial interrogation for any statement which might be used

against him on a charge of desertion or other military offense,

he must first be given the full Miranda warning. If he does not

then give an affirmative and voluntary waiver of the rights

specified in that warning, no interrogation shall be conducted.

The rule stated in U. S. vs. Holder, explained in

SAC Letter 59-38, remains unchanged. No warning of rights is

necessary so long as the interrogation of the deserter suspect

or subject is confined to identification only.

(E) LATIN AMERICAN SOLIDARITY ORGANIZATION (LASO)

CONFERENCE - HAVANA, CUBA, 7/28/67 - 8/5/67 -- LASO

was founded January 16, 1966, at conclusion of First Tri-,

Continental Conference held in Havana, Cuba, and represents

communist revolutionary and terrorist groups from 27 Latin-

American countries. Its avowed purpose is to plan ways and

means to overthrow United States "imperialism" in Latin

America by revolutionary violence. Credentials of groups

* dedicated to this purpose will be accepted at captioned

conference which has been called by LASO's Organizing

Committee, headed by Haydee Santamaria, long-time Cuban

communist who serves as permanent Secretary General. .

Approximately 197 opposition groups in Latin-

American countries were circularized concerning agenda and

objectives of conference and over 700 Cubans reportedly have

been analyzing results so final proposals for overthrow of

imperialism in Western Hemisphere can be presented. Possible

impact of massive, vitriolic action as result of conference

dictates that we seize every logical opportunity to develop

data as to identities of those attending and intelligence information

concerning methods projected by conference to accomplish its

sinister purposes.

Report all pertinent data under above caption. Character

is IS

sources having logical opportunity to visit Cuba in connection with

LASO Conference, July 26th Movement Celebration, or otherwise,

submit recommendations promptly and outline security factors

involved. Consider all logical possibilities as to source coverage

and coverage through other means, such as interviews of arriving

refugees and returning visitors, as well as monitoring of public

Cuban radio and television transmissions covering conference.

Submit all significant information developed by

expeditious means, utilizing teletype dissemination procedures

where warranted.

If teletype is not deemed justified, forward

(E) SOVIET NONO FFICIAL VISITORS WHO COME INDIVIDUALLY

TO THE UNITED STATES -- There has been an ever-increasing

number of Soviet citizens who are traveling to the United States to

visit relatives or friends. These individuals are granted B-2 visas.

In almost all cases they apply for these visas through the American

Embassy in Moscow. Occasionally they have applied at the American

Embassy in Canada and in the future it will be possible for them to

apply for a visa at the American Embassy in Mexico or the American

Embassies in Europe as well.

Most Soviet nationals coming to the United States are

subject to a system of travel restrictions which requires them to

notify the Department of State of intended travel plans 48 hours in

advance and which closes about 25 per cent of the country to them.

In 1962, individual Soviet tourists and exchange visitors were

exempted from these regulations, but the Department of State

retained a degree of control over

their travel. Individual tourists

were required to notify the Department of State of their travel plans

outside the area specified in their visa.

The Department of State has advised that a new reporting

system has been developed. Henceforth, Embassies issuing visas to

private Soviet visitors coming to the United States to visit relatives

and friends will mark the visa of these visitors "Valid for travel to

(first destination in U. S.) and within a 25 mile radius thereof.

Inform the local office United States Immigration and Naturalization

Service of travel plans outside the area. " Holders of such visas

will be informed that there is no restriction on their travel in the

United States but that they are required to keep the Immigration

and Naturalization Service District Office nearest them informed

in advance of intended travel more than 25 miles from their first

destination.

These new travel regulations apply only to Soviet citizens

coming to the United States for the purpose of visiting friends or

relatives.

Immigration and Naturalization Headquarters is presently

formulating plans as to how this new procedure will be implemented

and what records will be maintained. When these plans are

finalized you will be furnished complete details. In the meantime,

Immigration and Naturalization Service District Offices will advise

the Bureau field offices when information is obtained concerning

travel of these Soviet visitors. Instructions in Section 105E,

Manual of Instructions, pertain to the investigative coverage to

be given to these individuals. It will not be necessary to advise the

Bureau on an individual basis when information of such travel is

furnished your office by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

(G) STUDENTS FOR Á DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY -- The Chicago

Police Department recently advised the Chicago Office that

information was received by that department indicating that

Jobs or Income Now, the community action group of the Students

for a Democratic Society, has now purchased two used panel

trucks which are to be utilized for discreet photographic assign-

ments.

It is possible that these panel trucks could be made

available to the Students for a Democratic Society in order that

they might make use of them to compromise or embarrass

Special Agents. You should alert all Special Agent personnel

to this potential source of harassment and to take the necessary

precautions and be most circumspect when conducting investigations

of the Students for a Democratic Society and its members. Advise

the Bureau promptly of any information coming to your attention

regarding this matter.

(#*), SOVIET-BLOC ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN U. S. MAPS -- The

Soviet-Bloc Intelligence Services have placed considerable

emphasis upon the procurement of U. S. maps. Soviet-bloc

agents have used both open and covert activity to obtain such

data, and their efforts in this regard are constantly increasing.

Recently, a U.S. Department of State official advised

that the Hungarian Government is directing letters to major cities

throughout the U. S. and is requesting appropriate civic officials

of such cities to forward to Hungary detailed maps of the cities

contacted. Such maps, according to the Hungarian Government,

will be part of an International Exhibition to be held in Budapest,

Hungary, in November, 1967.

According to the State Department official, the State

Department is very much concerned over this activity by the

Hungarian Government and has written letters to 20 major cities

in the U. S. suggesting that these municipal governments refrain

from providing maps to the Hungarian Government. The State

Department is keenly interested in receiving any information

disclosing Soviet-bloc efforts to obtain U. S. maps and has

requested that any information received by the Federal Bureau of

Investigation in this connection be brought to the State Department's

attention.

This matter should be brought to the attention of all

personnel in each office who handle Soviet-bloc matters. Any

information received disclosing Soviet-bloc efforts to obtain

U. S. maps should be promptly furnished to the Bureau in a

letterhead memorandum suitable for dissemination. The

letterhead memorandum should be captioned "Soviet- Bloc

Attempts to Obtain U. S. Maps."

(I) PLANT INFORMANT PROGRAM - KEY FACILITIES

LIST - The Department of Defense has issued a revised Key

Facilities List referred to as KFL (Q) dated April 1, 1967.

Appropriate state sections of this list, which replaces KFL

(P), have been forwarded to the field for use in connection with

the Plant Informant Program.

It will be noted that the new list does not contain a

listing of the agency having security responsibility for each key

facility as did previous Key Facilities Lists. The Department

of Defense has advised this deletion was made due to the fact

that the Army has now been designated the agency having security

responsibility for all key facilities, and it is, therefore, not

necessary to identify the responsible agency for each individual

key facility on the Key Facilities List.

CASA DE LAS AMERICAS

On May 1, 1967, a source advised that the Casa de las

communist individuals, formed in April, 1964, has moved its

headquarters to the fourth floor, 876 Broadway, New York City,

as a successor to

name to avoid overt affiliation with Cuba. The CCC has been

composed of persons belonging to the now defunct 26th of July

Movement, a revolutionary organization founded and led by

Fidel Castro, Prime Minister of Cuba, until its dissolution in

1962.

A second source advised that the CCC, originally

founded as a social club by New York area residents of Cuban

extraction, was sympathetic to Castro during his struggle for

power. Subsequent to January 1, 1959, as it became apparent

that

communism was the form of government in Cuba,

the leaders

of the 26th of July Movement assumed control of CCC and its

membership declined.

The first source above advised that Casa de las

Americas is also ostensibly formed as a social club, but in

effect it acts as a focal point for revolutionary peoples

sympathetic to the Cuban government. Although it is not directly

controlled by the Cuban Mission to the United Nations

many Cuban personnel attend its functions and at least an indirect

link with CMUN is present.

Casa de las Americas

also gives financial support to other revolutionary groups repre-

senting countries other than Cuba.

committee members, as well as general members of Casa de las

in that

it is used as a staging ground prior to entry into

that membership in Casa de

desiring to return to Cuba.

This same source stated that although there exists

in Cuba a social club called Casa de las Americas supported

by the Cuban government, there appears to be no connection

between the two and no reason to believe that the Casa de las

Americas in New York was named after the one in Cuba.

including the use of firearms;

¿ To organize CPUsA, MoL, cells in the

South, to exploit

"racial situations"

that might arise there, to agitate the

population, and create situations which

require the use of Federal troops

so that Americans would be fighting

Americans;

3.

To establish and maintain an accelerated

recruiting program to include acceptance

of anyone who is an anti-imperialist.

A source advised on May 28, 1962, FUPI was

elected an integral member of the International Union of

Students (IUS), Prague, Czechoslovakia, in October, 1960.

On August 25, 1966, Alberto Perez Perez was inter-

viewed by public news media and he stated he was President of

FUPI; had just returned from travel to Moscow, USSR, on an

official FUPI trip, and

subsequent conferences of the IUS in

Bulgaria; Cairo, Lgypt; and Havana, Cuba; FUPl continues to be

affiliated with

the IUS; and he and FUPI

advocate independence

for Puerto Rico, preferably without violence, but would resort

to violence to obtain independence if it appeared other methods

would fail.

When Interviewed on April 8, 1966, dose Rafael Varona

Berrios stated he was the Secretary of International Affairs of

FUPI; FUPI is affiliated with the IUS; and he believed in vio-

lence as a method of obtaining independence for Puerto Rico if

conditions indicated violence might succeed, or aid, in

obtaining Puerto Rican independence. Varona reportedly was in-

jured during a bombing raid by U. S. planes while he was visiting

• North Vietnam in April, 1967.

The IUS has been cited by the Internal Security Sub-

committee of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1956 as being

MOV IMIENTO PRO-INDEPENDENCIA DE PUERTO RICO

(PUERTO RICAN INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT) (MPIPR)

The MPIPR was organized in November, 1959, at Ponce,

Puerto Rico, to work for the independence of Puerto

Rico. It

has an estimated membership of between 1,000 and 1,300 people

with missions throughout the island of Puerto Rico, and in

New York, New York; Chicago, Illinois; and Buifalo, New York.

At the time the MPIPR was organized it was indicated

that it did not advocate violence but would accept members who

did.

Juan Mari Bras, the founder and dominant leader of this

organization, in a speech during March, 1964, threatened violence

comparable to that in Algeria if Puerto Rico

became a state within

the United States. A source reported in 1966 that a leader of

the MPIPR indicated that "the Revolution would soon begin" and

another source advised that another official of this organization

had attempted to obtain a number of automatic pistols.

Articles praising Fidel Castro and the Cuban Government

regularly appear in MPIPR publications. In 1961, the MPIPR

adopted a resolution expressing 100 per cent approval of and

solidarity with the Cuban revolution.

It sent a delegation to

the Tri-Continental Conference of African, Asian, and Latin

American People, held in Havana, Cuba, during January, 1966, and

it maintains a permanent delegate to the Secretariat located in

Havana.

has

The press of Puerto Rico has reported that the MPIPR

held numerous demonstrations protesting compulsory military

service for Puerto Ricans and United States policy in Vietnam

and the Dominican Republic.

In December, 1966, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed

into law a bill calling for a plebiscite on July 23, 1967, to

determine the future political status of Puerto RiCo. The press

reported that this plebiscite has been denounced vociferously by

the MPIPR as "an act of Yankee imperialism to maintain the

colonial status of Puerto Rico."

Juan Mari Bras stated that the

MPIPR had

asked the Cuban Government for "militant solidarity

with our struggle, in all international forums to which Red Cuba

has access."

MUSLIM GIRLS TRAINING

On May 19, 1960, a source advised the Muslim Girls

similar in structure to the Fruit of Islam (FOI), which is

composed of male members of the NOI, in that the

MGT has

officers similar to military organizations to whom other fe-

male members are accountable. MGT members receive instructions

in homemaking, hygiene, calisthenics, and other subjects such

as Muslim history, and

the English language.

There also exists

a Junior MGT, which is composed of female members of the NOI

who are between the ages of 15 and 19 and who are afforded

military-type drill.

Since 1957, various officers and "sisters" of the MGT

have, at meetings of the MGT, used the term MGT so that it also

means

The NOI is an all-Negro organization which was

originally organized in 1930 in Detroit, Michigan. Muhammad

claims to have been selected by Allah, the Supreme Being, to

lead the so-called Negro race out of

slavery in the wilderness

of North America by establishing an independent black nation in

the United States.

Members following Muhammad's teachings and

his interpretation of the "Koran" believe there is no such thing

as a Negro; the so-called Negroes are slaves of the white race,

referred to as "white devils," in the United States; and the

white race,

because of its exploitation of the so-called Negroes,

must and will be destroyed in the approaching "War of Armageddon."

In the past, officials and members of the NOI, including

Muhammad, have refused to register under the provisions of the

Selective Service Acts and have declared that members owe no

allegiance to the United States.

On May 5, 1958, the first source advised Muhammad had,

upon advice of legal counsel, tempered his personal statements

and instructions to his ministers concerning the principles of

his organization in order to avoid possible prosecution by the

United States Government; however, he did not indicate any

furdamental changes in the teachings of his organization.

a third source advised Muhammad had,

benefits to be derived by those Negroes who joined the not.

This policy change, according to Muhammad, would help him

acquire

additional followers and create more interest in his programs.

new committee would serve its purpose in fighting the McCarran

Act alone and the CP had everything to gain by taking this

position. Lillian Berman, NCRMA Executive Secretary, is not a

CP member but knowingly accepts support and advice from the CP

leadership on behalf of this committee.

Berman moved from Chicago

to New York, New York, in 1965, and continues to operate the

committee from that city.

rights," while the initial objective is to "internationalize" the

American civil rights movement by taking it to the United Nations.

Little condemned the nonviolent civil rights movement and claims

that Negroes should be taught to protect themselves, when and if

necessary. The OAAU will sponsor a program for Negroes in

education, politics, culture, economics, and social reform.

REVOLUTIONARY ACTION MOVEMENT

known to be a member of the Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM) •

This document stated, in part, that RAM was officially

organized in the Winter of 1963 by Afro-Americans who support the

revolutionary objectives of Robert f. Hilliams, then residing in

Cuba, and his concept of organized violence to

achieve the

liberation of the Afro-American people in the United States. This

Manifesto disclosed that RAM had oriented its program to one of

education and political revolution and the organization of a

"black" political party with revolutionary objectives, having

recognized the need for a "black revolution" that could and would

seize power.

RAM philosophy is described in this document as one

of revolutionary nationalism; that is,

one involving the struggles

of the nonwhite races of the

world against exploitation and

Regarding Williams, it should be noted that on

August 28, 1961, a Federal warrant was issued at Charlotte,

North Carolina,

charging him with Unlawful flight to avoid

Prosecution for the crime of kidnapping.

Subsequent to the

issuance of this warrant, Williams fled the United States to

Cuba, where he published

a monthly newsletter entitled "The

Crusader" from Havana.

As of December, 1966, Williams was

residing in Peking, China.

This source, in September, 1964, advised RAM iS

dedicated to the overthrow of the capitalist system in the

United States by violence, if necessary, and to its replacement

by a socialistic system oriented toward the Chinese Communist

interpretation of Marxism-Leninism. RAM is entirely nonwhite

in membership, clandestine in nature, and owes its primary

allegiance to the "Bandung World"; that is, the nonwhite races

of the world rather than to any national entity, as such.

On November 16, 1964, a second source advised he

learned recently from a RAM member that the organization began

in Detroit, Michigan, largely under the impetus of Don Freeman,

described as the "Father" of RAM and referred to as RAM'S

"Black Stalin.". Freeman served as RAM Chairman, with Maxwell

Stanford (now of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) serving as RAM

Field Chairman.

On May 12, 1967, a third source advised that the RAM

still remains active; nowever, there is no formal headquarters,

as such, for the ram. The source advised that Maxwell Stanford

of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is considered the leader of RAM

and if anRAM headquarters ever existed, it would most likely be

where

Stanford resides.

On April 17, 1967, a source advised as follows:

Tim Wolforth, when a member of the Socialist Workers

Party (SWP) National Committee, led a minority group of ten

accusing the majority of losing revolutionary perspective.

The

Wolforth group adhered to the views of British

Trotskyists,

with whom it secretly consorted, and with certain co-thinkers

in the International Committee

of the Fourth International (FI),

a world Trotskyist organization. It accused the leadership of

adopting views of these within the FI who favored "bureaucratic"

revolution over the genuine "revolutionary working-class outlook"

of Leon Trotsky. Domestically, the Wolforth faction opposed

SWP orientation toward student

activity, feeling the Party should

place major emphasis on trade unions and participation in the

civil rights struggle.

differences on varied issues concerning tactics and interpretation

of political events, split from the SWP on the grounds that the

Party was liquidating itself

by departing from the Marxist pre-

cepts of Leon Trotsky and retreating from the fight for the world

The final issue which ultimately forced the

the initial edition utilizing the magazine format,

relates

that this magazine succeeds the "Young Socialist"

news-

paper in an effort to provide "more facts on more general issues

than a small newspaper can."

The "Young Socialist" newspaper was formerly described

as the official organ of the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA).

The "Young Socialist" maintains office space at the

headquarters of the YSA, Rooms 532-536, 41 Union Square West,

New York City, and has a

Cooper Station, New York, New York 10003.

YOUNG SOCIALIST ALLIANCE

The May, 1960, issue of the "Young Socialist" (YS),

page 1, column 3, disclosed that during April 15-17, 1960,

national organization entitled "The Young Socialist

Alliance"

(YSA) was established at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

This issue

stated that this organization was formed by the nationwide

supporter clubs of the publication YS.

Declaration of the YSA.

This declaration stated that the YsA

recognizes the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) as the only existing

political leadership on class struggle principles, and that the

supporters of the YS have come into basic political solidarity

with the SWP on the principles of revolutionary socialism.

particularly members and followers of the SWP. The source further

advised that the YSA has recently become more open about

admitting that it is the youth group of the SWP and that an SYP

representative has

publicly stated that the YSA is the SWp's

youth group.

The headquarters of the YSA are located in Rooms 532-536,

YOUTH AGAINST WAR AND FASCISM

A source

advised on March 29, 1965, that the Youth

Against War and Fascism (YAWF), formerly known as the Anti-Fascist

Youth Committee,

was established by the Workers Horld Party (WWP)

in the Summer of 1962 to bring college and high school youth into

the periphery of WWP activities and thereby gain recruits for the

organization.

A second source advised on October 23, 1964, that a

flyer distributed by the YAVF described that organization as a

militant organization of young workers and worker-students for

combating war and fascism.

The first source advised on May 1, 1967, that the YAWE

maintains its headquarters at 58 West 25th Street, New York City,

and publishes a magazine called "The Partisan."

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

In Reply, Please Refer 10

" File No.

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

October 24, 1967

(ANARREST AND ARRAIGNMENT -- The Department of Justice long

has held and expressed the view that the showing of probable cause

necessary at a preliminary hearing can be made by hearsay evidence.

This means that if an Agent arrests the subject in one place and the

subject is then taken to a different place for a preliminary hearing, it

is not necessary for the arresting Agent to travel to the place of

hearing to give direct testimony on the facts of probable cause. His

testimony can be given, instead, by an Agent assigned to the city in

which the hearing is held. The latter Agent simply takes the official

reports submitted by the arresting Agent in the form of reports, teletypes,

airtels, et cetera, and testifies to the facts of probable cause shown in

those communications.

Despite the position taken by the Department of Justice, we

continue to encounter cases in which the United States Commissioner

refuses to accept hearsay evidence at the preliminary hearing and insists

upon the direct testimony of the Agent, however distant, who learned the

facts of probable cause from his own investigation. The result is that the

latter Agent must be transported from his city of assignment to the city

of preliminary hearing at whatever cost is required in time and money.

On September 29, 1967, the Department sent a form

memorandum to all United States Attorneys concerning the problem

discussed above. The Department asks for answers to specific questions.

and obviously is interested in the extent to which Commissioners permit

hearsay evidence to be used in establishing probable cause.

Should you have any recent cases in which a Commissioner

within your territory has insisted upon an Agent being brought in from

another city to snow probable cause at a preliminary hearing: rather than

allow probable cause to be shown by the hearsay testimony of an Agent

assigned locally, you should promptly advise the United States Attorney so

that he may call these cases to the attention of the Department.

Also bring these same cases to the attention of the Bureau and

advise on a continuing basis of future cases in which the Commissioner

refuses to accept hearsay testimony of an Agent assigned locally.

Advise all investigative personnel.

(5) UNIFORM CRIME REPORTS -- In their concernjover the crime

problem'and the administration of criminal justice, many states are now

recognizing the need to establish centralized state systems of criminal

statistics.

The pending Federal crime legislation calls for the establish-

ment of planning units at state level to implement the provisions of the

crime legislation, particularly financial assistance.

Without a collection

of statistical information--police, courts and corrections--states are in

no position to plan nor to make intelligent decisions affecting the criminal

justice system.

The FBI has administered the Uniform Crime Reporting

Program since 1930. It is the only nationwide collection of crime data.

There are no national court statistics or complete correctional statistics

on a national basis. Recommendations have been made, particularly by

the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of

Justice, to implement a national collection from the courts and corrections.

The FBI's experience of operating a national program of data collection is,

therefore, unique.

In my Preface to Uniform Crime Reports - 1966, I pointed

out very clearly the need for the states to develop central reporting

systems. The FBI stands ready to assist state agencies in setting up

procedures, methods and policies in connection with crime reporting

programs.

This training and the sharing of knowledge, which the FBI

has gained from experience, have been afforded to state agency

representatives both here at the Seat of Government, as well as in the

field.

You will be kept informed as to the progress of the pending

legislation in this area, which will accelerate the growth of state

systems. Contacts are to be established and maintained at the state

level so that appropriate state authorities are fully aware of the FBI's

desire to render assistance.

In your contacts with local police agencies, you should

stress the necessity of maintaining records for administrative and

investigative use.

You should encourage all police agencies which are

not doing so to submit crime reports to the FBI's Uniform Crime

Reporting Program. Lists identifying agencies not reporting to the

Uniform Crime Reporting Program have been forwarded to the

appropriate Special Agent in Charge. In your next contacts with

the heads of these agencies they should be urged to contribute crime

reports to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program.

(C) SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION CHARACTERIZATION - CONTACT

MAILING SERVICE -- SAC Letter 67-50, dated August 21, 1957,

provided a subversive organization characterization for the Contact

Mailing Service. This characterization is being amended to show

that it is currently being operated by Stanley Goodman. Set forth

below is an up-to-date characterization of the Contact Mailing Service

which replaces the one in SAC Letter 67-50.

A source advised that Gus Hall, General Secretary of the

Communist Party, USA, in March, 1962, stated he wanted to set up

an office in New York for the centralization of "our mailing lists, "

so that mailing lists could be furnished to Communist Party groups

or Communist Party front groups which needed them. The

Communist Party would invest money in this business and Bradford

Bingham, a general handyman for Gus Hall, would operate it

ostensibly as a private enterprise.

On May 12, 1964, a second source furnished information

indicating that the Bradford Bingham Mailing Service conducts a

mailing service business in Room 636 at 799 Broadway, New York,

New York.

In March, 1966, the first source advised that Gus Hall

had stated that the Communist Party had replaced the Bradford

Bingham Mailing Service with the Contact Mailing Service which

would serve the same purpose and function in the same manner as the

Bradford Bingham Mailing Service.

On September 20, 1967, the second source advised that

the Contact Mailing Service was presently being operated by Stanley

Goodman in Room 636 at 799 Broadway, New York, New York.

On November' 23, 1963, Special Agents of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation observed Stanley Goodman enter a meeting

hall at 61 Rivington Street, New York, New York; where, according

to a third source, a meeting limited to Communist Party members

was being held.

D) RIOTS AND DISTURBANCES -- Although the season for violent

racial turmoil, which appears to have become a summer phenomenon,

may be over there is no guarantee that serious outbreaks of racial

violence will not occur in the fall and winter months. This is particularly

true when militant Negro agitators of the H. Rap Brown variety continue

to go about the country fanning the fires of racial discord and animosity.

It is essential, therefore, that there be no slackening in our coverage

of the racial situation through racial, criminal, and security informants,

sources, and in-depth liaison with law enforcement officials so that we

will be completely knowledgeable of trouble spots and any indications of

outbreaks of violence.

For your information, the Department of Justice by

communication dated October 3, 1967, advised all United States

Attorneys that the Department will retain the Communications Center

established by it at the beginning of the summer to receive current

reports of civil disturbances and disorders from all areas on a 24-

hour basis. The Department requested the United States Attorneys to

continue reporting to the Communications Center all relevant information

relating to possible civil disturbances in their communities.

You should make certain that your coverage of possible

civil disturbance situations continues to be such that the Bureau will be

kept fully advised of all pertinent developments by the most expeditious

means warranted. This is absolutely essential in order that the Bureau

may answer any inquiries received and carry out its racial intelligence

dissemination responsibilities to the Department and other interested

Government agencies on a timely basis. You should, of course, also

make appropriate local dissemination in accordance with existing Bureau

instructions.

Very truly yours,

• John Edgar Hoover

During your investigative coverage of all militant black

nationalists, be most alert to any foreign travel. Advise the Bureau

promptly of such in order that appropriate overseas investigations

may be conducted to establish activities and contacts abroad.

In addition, each office should submit a letterhead

memorandum with the above caption within 30 days setting forth all

information contained therein having a bearing upon this matter. The

information is to include indications of foreign support, direction,

guidance or influence, as well as a listing of individual black

nationalists residing in the territory covered by your office who have

traveled to communist countries within the past two years. Each

office should open a control file captioned as above to which should be •

directed copies of all information developed along these lines.

A control file has been established at the Bureau with the

above caption. Bureau file 157-8141.

The semimonthly memorandum entitled "Possible Racial

Violence, Major Urban Areas" submitted for the purpose of keeping

the Bureau and interested agencies apprised of the potential for

violence in the United States should set forth any pertinent data

developed on a current basis concerning foreign influence in these

matters. When you have information to be reported in this regard

it should be set forth under the caption of this SAC Letter.

This matter should receive your close, personal attention

on a continuing basis.

(F) TRAVEL MATTERS - CUBA -- Recently a Cuban alien who had

entered the United States as the holder of a visitor's visa volunteered

to us information concerning his recruitment in Cuba for an intelligence

mission in the United States. A visitor's visa had been issued to him

and his mother in a Caribbean country. They had been permitted to

leave Cuba to seek medical assistance for the mother.

Our procedures to detect intelligence agents among Cuban

refugees who enter this country under provisions of the United States

Government's Cuban Refugee Program (CRP) (SAC Letters 67-8 (F)

and 67-52 (I) are not applicable to Cuban aliens with visitors' visas as

they do not come within the purview of CRP.

To assure prompt notification to us of such Cuban aliens,

Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) is instructing its offices

to notify the nearest FBI Office on a daily basis as to the admittance

(and departure when known) of all nonimmigrant Cuban nationals except

crewmen. In order to neutralize the possible intelligence assignment

in the United States of such Cuban aliens, investigation of them is to be

conducted in accordance with provisions of Section 105E3b (4), Manual

of Instructions, relating to nonofficial visitors from the USSR. Manual

changes are being prepared.

(A) EXPUNGING ARREST DATA - The volume of correspondence from

citizens, attorneys, and court officials, concerning the expungement of arrest

data from FBI identification files has increased substantially. Accordingly,

we are immediately disseminating a letter to all fingerprint contributors

(copy attached).

Bear in mind that while non- Federal arrest prints will be returned

to the submitting agency upon request, the same procedure is not followed as

regards Federal arrest prints. The latter are property of the United States

Government and are retained permanently in our files. U. S. Marshals Manual,

702. 02, provides "Fingerprint records may not in any case be returned to a

defendant, whether or not he is acquitted of the charge against him." U. S.

Attorneys Manual, 8-83, provides "United States Attorneys are directed to

vigorously oppose all petitions, applications, or motions filed in any district

court seeking the return or destruction of such records." The Federal courts

consistently have upheld this right to retain Federal arrest prints.

In your contacts with law enforcement agencies and court officials,

please emphasize that we will return non-Federal arrest prints only to the

contributing agency and this results in an automatic expunction of such

information in our files. The request for the return of prints must emanate

from the contributing agency. We will not honor requests from other sources,

including court orders supplied directly by local courts, even though charges

have been dismissed or subject acquitted. All Special Agents in your office

should be thoroughly familiar with these procedures.

SAC Letter 55-26 dated March 29, 1955, Paragraph E,

specifically instructed that an informant was not to be classified as

being "of known reliability" but rather when pertinent as one "who has

furnished reliable information in the past." Manual of Rules and

overall request that this Bureau assist in targeting special areas and

individuals in an effortto gather more concrete information on activities

of black extremists and their supporters in Canada who identify with

are the following matters which are of extreme concern to Canadian

authorities:

(1) Vancouver Black Action Group (VBAG), active on Canadian

West Coast and comprised of many foreign black extremists (including

several draft dodgers and deserters from the United States), several

members of which reportedly have made plans to return to the san :

Francisco, California, area; (2) Visits by members of Black Panther

Party (BPP) and other black extremists; (3) BPP Information Center,

Winnepeg, Manitoba, established through the auspices of an individual

who identifies himself with the Illinois chapter of the BPP; (4) Black

Youth Organization, Toronto, Ontario, which favors the BPP program;

• (5) Peggy Morton, Toronto resident and important contact in Canada

for black extremists from the United States; (6) Loosely knit center of

assistance and refuge for fugitives which appears to have been

established in the Toronto area; (7) Roosevelt "Rosie" Douglas and

Brenda Dickenson Dash, prominent Montreal area black extremists

who have international ties. Efforts of Douglas are being concentrated

nationals centered in Montreal and Toronto to support guerrilla activities

in the Caribbean.

The RCMP has additionally made specific requests for infor-

mation regarding the significance of the move by the BAG members

to the United States, any information indicating the Communist Party,

USA, is aiding black revolutionaries and fugitives within the United

States and its contact, if any, with the Communist Party of Canada in

this regard and any movement of funds to Canada destined to revolutionaries

in the Caribbean area which revolutionaries reportedly plan armed con-

frontation with Governments in that area.

Alert all Special Agent personnel engaged in Racial Matters

investigations to the RCMP prime interest areas in the racial field and

target informants to develop information in these areas. In addition,

remain constantly alert for opportunities to send our informants to

Canada and give consideration to such action in all instances where

warranted. Information developed in the racial field which is of interest

to Canadian authorities must be furnished to the Bureau promptly.

(G) RACIAL AND SECURITY INFORMANTS -- Recently an informant

voluntarily advised a police officer who was investigating a case that he

was assisting the FBI. While this police officer has maintained the

confidence of the above information, this incident should not have occurred.

There has been another incident where an informant has voluntarily

disclosed his identity as a source of this Bureau and his actions were not

in keeping with the Bureau's system of controlling and directing the

informants.

In view of the above, each Special Agent in Charge must

insure that Special Agents operating informants impress on these

informants the necessity of informants maintaining the confidential nature

of their relationship with the FBI.

It should also be impressed upon the informants that in the

event they have any doubts as to what course of action to take, they should

immediately contact a representative of the FBI and be guided by the

instructions given to them.

In addition, each Special Agent handling informants must

afford these informants close supervision and control so that incidents can

be avoided which may affect Bureau operations.

Each Special Agent in Charge is being held personally

responsible to insure that the Special Agents assigned to his division are

affording the informants being operated by them tight supervision and

control in accordance with the above.

(B) BALTIMORE SOURCE 4 -- Requests for a check of Baltimore Source 4

have continued to increase. In this regard a Social Security Administration

official has advised that agency has a las usually of approximately four

months in posting employment information. The increase in requests

for a check of Baltimore Source 4 are related directly, of course,

to this Bureau's increasing case load in the Deserter and Selective

Service fugitive categories. Since a large number of these fugitive

cases are resolved within the first six months and in view of the lag

in posting employment information, you are hereby instructed to

initiate a request of a check of records of Baltimore Source 4 only

• in fugitive cases which have been under investigation for a period of

six months. You are also reminded that in all cases requests for a

check of Baltimore Source 4 must be restricted to those wherein

other avenues of investigation have been unproductive.

It is absolutely

imperative that this most valuable source continue to be available to

the Bureau and every effort must be made to insure that the source is

not overburdened with requests. Appropriate change in Manual of

Instructions, Section 9, page 26a, will be forthcoming.

(B) SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION CHARACTERIZATION - AMERICAN

SERVICEMEN'S UNION -- Set forth below is an up-to-date characteri-

zation of the American Servicemen's Union (ASU) which is believed to

have field-wide application.

On September 20, 1969, a source advised that the ASU,

formed during early 1968, maintains headquarters at 156 Fifth Avenue,

New York, New York. ASU is dominated and controlled by the

Workers World Party (WWP) and is designed to advance WWP efforts

to undermine United States political and military objectives abroad

by fomenting discontent among military enlisted personnel and by

calling for the establishment of a servicemen's union. ASU's chief

propaganda weapon is the publication of "The Bond - The Servicemen's

Newspaper" which is widely circulated at military installations free

of charge and at times unsolicited.

: The source also advised that the ASU's Chairman is Andrew

Dean Stapp, undesirably discharged from the United States Army in

April, 1968. Stapp is a member of the WWP. ASU and "The Bond"

are terms used interchangeably in connection with WWP interests in

military matters. The former has no real existence apart from the

latter since the publication is the primary means of generating interest

among and communicating with servicemen interested in the formation

of a union. The Union does not function as an organization at this

time. It has, however, been given much publicity in each edition of

"The Bond."

A characterization of the WWP as set out on page

44 of SAC Letter 69-50 dated September 19, 1969,

will be used in conjunction with the above

characterization.

Minnesota, in 1967, that Mike Myerson was forming an anti-imperialist

center. This center became known as the Tri-Continental Information

Center (TCIC) and maintained an office in Room 640, 1133 Broadway,

New York City.

A second source advised on May 11, 1967, that the TCIC was

founded by Mike Myerson, who attended a Communist Party, USA,

National Committee meeting in June, 1967, in New York City, as a

Communist Party front organization

The TCIC was described in Volume I, Number 1, May, 1967,

issue of the "Tri-Continental Information Center Bulletin" as an

organization established to raise, through education and information, an

anti-imperialist consciousness in the United States--particularly within

the growing movements for peace, human rights and democracy.

considered defunct as of that time.

STUDENT NATIONAL COORDINATING COMMITTEE

A source advised the Student National Coordinating

Committee (SNCC), formerly known as the Student Nonviolent

Coordinating Committee, is a nonmembership organization founded

in 1960, during the civil rights movement in the South.

Under the leadership of Stokely Carmichael, who served

as National Chairman during the period 1966-67, SNCC evolved from

a civil rights oriented group into a full-blown black revolutionary

organization.

A publication entitled "1967 High Tide of Black

Resistance" indicates the year 1967 was considered by SNCC as a

historic milestone for the liberation of black people in the

United States and the year that revolutionaries throughout the

world began to understand more fully the impact of the black

movement.

The publication declared that "liberation will come

only when there is final destruction of this mad octopus--the

capitalistic system of the United States with all its life-

sucking tentacles of exploitation and racism that choke the

people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The realities of

black life, together with the recognition instilled in 'SNCC

workers, forced its members to further popularize the legitimacy

of self-defense

and rebellions when oppression became too great."

A second source advised that H. Rap Brown succeeded

Carmichael as National Chairman of SNCC in May, 1968, and served

in that capacity until June, 1968, at which time SNCC reorganized,

creating ten deputy chairmen in an effort to relieve pressure by

law enforcement.

In April, 1969, SNCC moved its national headquarters

from Atlanta, Georgia, to New York City, where it is presently

located.

-

H. Rap Brown announced at a press conference in

New York City on July 22, 1969, that he had been elected

Chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.

He announced the organization was dropping the word

"Nonviolent" from its title and will be known as the

Student National Coordinating Committee, with a Revolutionary

Political Council functioning as its governing body. Brown,

at that time, stated the use of force is necessary in obtaining

revolutionary goals.

elitist faction which denies the historical role of the working class as

the base for revolution. RYM II maintains that revolution, although

desired, is not possible under present conditions, hence emphasizes

organizing and raising the political consciousness of the working class

upon whom they feel successful revolution depends. Although disclaiming

control and domination by the Communist Party, USA, leaders in these two

factions have in the past proclaimed themselves to be communists and

to follow the precepts of a Marxist-Leninist philosophy, along pro-

Chinese communist lines.

A second source has advised that the PLP faction which

is more commonly known as the Worker Student Alliance is dominated

and controlled by members of the PLP, who are required to identify

themselves with the pro-Chinese Marxist-Leninist philosophy of the

PLP. They advocate that an alliance between workers and students

is vital to the bringing about of a revolution in the United States.

SDS regions and university and college chapters, although

operating under the outlines of the SDS National Constitution, are

autonomous in nature and free to carry out independent policy reflective

of local conditions.

Because of this autonomy internal struggles

reflecting the major factional interests of SDS have occurred at the

chapter level since the beginning of the 1969-70 school year.

A characterization of PLP is attached.

REVOLUTIONARY ACTION MOVEMENT

A source in November, 1964, made available a document

which indicated that the Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM) was

organized in 1963 by Afro-Americans who supported the revolutionary

objectives of Robert F. Williams and his concept of organized

violence to achieve the liberation of Afro-American people in

the United 'States.

Williams fled the United States in 1961 following

issuance of a local warrant for his arrest on a charge of

kidnapping growing out of a racial incident in Monroe,

North Carolina. He published and broadcast hate-type

material in Cuba and China prior to his return to the

United States in September, 1969.

According to this document, RAM oriented its

program to education, political revolution and the organization

of a black political party with revolutionary objectives, recog-

nizing the need for "black revolution" that could and would

seize power. This source in September, 1964, advised that RAM

is dedicated to the overthrow of the capitalistic system in the

United States, by violence if necessary, and to its replacement

by a socialistic system oriented toward the Chinese Communist

interpretation of Marxism-Leninism.

(C) STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY - SUBVERSIVE ORGANI-

ZATION CHARACTERIZATION -- Set forth below is a current characteri-

zation of Students for a Democratic Society which should be utilized in

the future when it is necessary to characterize this organization in

investigative reports and other types of communications.

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the Students for a Democratic

Society (SDS), as it is known today, came into being at a founding

convention held at Port Huron, Michigan, in June, 1962. From an

initial ideological posture of "participatory democracy," the current

line of the national leadership reveals an adherence to Marxism-Leninism.

Michael Klonsky, National Secretary, in March, 1969, called for the

building of a revolutionary Marxist-Leninist movement. The program

of SDS has moved from involvement in civil rights struggles to an anti-

Vietnam war position and finally to its present advocacy of an anti-

imperialist line, linking up the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and

Latin America with the black liberation movement in the United States.

China, Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as countries which are leading

the world-wide struggles against United States imperialism. On the

other hand, SDS regards the Soviet Union as an imperialist power and

On December 17, 1954, the Committee on Un-American

Activities of the United

published a "Preliminary Report on Neo-Fascist and Hate

Groups" in which their growth and objectives are discussed

at length. The report indicates that "Common Sense" has a

cIrculation which Iluctuates between 30,000 and 100,000

copies an issue.

It describes "Common Sense" as a "hate

sheet" vehicle which publishes "some of the most vitriolic

hate propaganda ever to come to the attention of the

Committee."

According to the report, "Common Sense" depicts

Communism as Judaism and devotes its pages almost entirely

to attacks on the Jewish and to a lesser extent: the Negro

minorities in the United States. Sympathy for the former

Nazi government in Germany is also shown in the paper.

(A),/ FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY - SEVENTY-SECOND SESSION -- The Seventy-

second Session of the FBI National Academy will begin on Monday,

August 19, 1963, and will graduate on Wednesday, November 6, 1903.

It is desired that you submit to the Bureau by April 1, 1963, the

names of the candidates from your territory whom you desire to

recommend to attend that Session. You should strictly comply with

existing instructions previously given as to the procedures to be

followed in nominating candidates to attend the Academy.

All candidates recommended for attendance at the Academy

must be personally known to the Special Agent in Charge. The

Special Agent in Charge must have conducted a formal interview with

each candidate being recommended unless such candidate has been

previously interviewed and favorably recommended by the former

Special Agent in Charge within the preceding six months. It will

not be necessary, however, for the present Special Agent in Charge

to reinterview any candidates he, himself, interviewed even though

more than six months have elapsed since the time of the first

interview.

You may designate more than one candidate for the Seventy-

second Session since there is a possibility that your first candidate

may not be accepted or that two or more representatives will be

accepted from your office. Unless you advise to the contrary, any

candidate investigated as an alternate to the Seventy-first Session

who is not invited to attend that Session, will be considered as the

first choice of your office for the Seventy-second Session, provided

of course his investigation was completely favorable. In your

letter listing your candidates, you must specifically set forth

the results of the reviews of your field office indices concerning

the applicants and their law enforcement agencies.

The Bureau is desirous of accepting at the National

Academy only those candidates who are outstanding both as to personal

appearance and ability. The weight standards for National Academy

applicants are the same as

for our own personnel. Applicants must

be within the desirable weight limits as set forth on form FD-300. If

you have previously submitted a physical examination on any candidate

which will be more than six months old as of April 1, 1963, a

current physical examination form must be executed with the ac-

companying FD-300.

The fingerprints of National Academy applicants are to be

submitted at the time the results of the formal interview are for-

warded to the Bureau. You should make a notation on the fingerprint

each regularly scheduled inspection. Manual changes are forthcoming.

Furthermore, you are reminded that Daily Reports must be

accounting for his time. As a general rule, it should be possible

for these to be executed currently as the Agent pursues his daily

work. Exceptions to this might be warranted where the Agent must

give precedence to a fast-moving case.

In any event, however,

the Bureau insists that whenever these reports are executed they

must be completely reconcilable and

(E) NATIONAL BANKRUPTCY ACT MATTERS - The Fraud Section, Criminal

Division, Department of Justice, in an attempt to induce more

vigorous

action by U. S. Attorneys as regards prosecution of vio-

lations of the National Bankruptcy Act (NBA) is closely reviewing

all Bureau NBA reports with particular attention being given to

those wherein the U. S. Attorney declines prosecution.

In connection

therewith the Department has adopted a form letter addressed to the

U. S. Attorney and signed by Assistant Attorney General, Criminal

Division, which states in part:

"It is our opinion that the declination as set

forth in the said FBI report does not conform to the

Bankruptcy Section of the United States Attorneys'

Manual, Title II, page 61.

This section requires

that in declining prosecution in bankruptcy matters

that cogent and reasonably detailed reasons for such

declination together with specific reference to the

facts of the case shall be reported to the Attorney

General

(1) by report to the FBI or (2) by letter

addressed to the Criminal Division, Department of

Justice.

In keeping with the foregoing, it is imperative that in

NBA cases wherein the U. S. Attorney declines prosecution that his

reasons Ior so doing are set lorth in suilicient detail to permit

adequate evaluation thereof by the Department.

(F) INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF GAMBLING DEVICES - DEPARTMENTAL

OPINION CONCERNING GAMBLING WHEELS -- Based on an inquiry from the

field as to whether gambling wheels (a device sometimes known as

a wheel of fortune) are gambling devices falling within the purview

of the Interstate Iransportation of Gambling Devices statute, the

Department has furnished an opinion that such gambling wheels do

fall within the purview of the 1962 amendments to this statute.

This type of gambling wheel contains a series of numbers,

which numbers correspond to a board on which a sum of money is placed

on a particular number by the participant or customer. After the

wheel is spun and stops on a particular number, the corresponding number

on the board determines the winner. !

The winner, in turn, receives

money or merchandise.

(E) COMMUNIST PARTY, USA - NEGRO QUESTION - COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN

RACIAL MATTERS - The history .of the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA),

is replete with its attempts to exploit, influence and recruit the

Negro. The March on Washington, August 20, 1903, was a striking

example as farty leaders early put into motion efforts to accrue

gains for the CPUSA from the March.

The presence at the March of

around 200 Party members, ranging from several national functionaries

headed by CPUSA General Secretary Gus Hall to many rank-and-file

members, is clear indication of the Party's favorite target (the

Negro, today.

All indications are that the March was not the "end

of the line" and that the Party will step up its efforts to exploit

racial unrest and in every possible way claim credit for itself

relating to any

indication of the Party's designs is revealed in secret information

obtained from a most sensitive source that the Party plans to hold

a highly secretive leadership meeting in November, 1963, which will

deal primarily with the Negro situation. The Party has closely guarded

plans for us Hall to undertake a "barnstorming" trip through key

areas of the country to meet Party people and thus better prepare

himself for the November meeting.

In order for the Bureau to cope with the Party's efforts

• and thus fulfill our responsibilities in the security field, it is

necessary that we at once intensify our coverage of communist

influence on the Negro.

Fullest consideration should be given to

the use of all possible investigative techniques in the investigation

of the CPUSA, those communist fronts through which the Party channels

Its influence, and the many individual Party members and dupes.

There is also an urgent need for imaginative and aggressive tactics

to be utilized through our Counterintelligence Program for the

purpose of attempting to neutralize or disrupt the Party's

activities in the Negro field.

Because of the Bureau's responsibility

for timely dissemination of pertinent information to the Department

and other interested agencies, it is more than ever necessary that

all facets of

this matter receive prompt handling.

Because of the Party's intensified efforts to render in-

fluence in racial matters, the Bureau is closing its subfile 100-3-75

relating to CPUSA - Negro

•relating to the Negro question, as well as communist influence in

SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION CHARACTERIZATION - INTERNAL SECURITY -

SAC Letter 63-39 dated August 6, 1963, provided a subversive organi-

zation characterization for the Progressive Labor Movement. Set

forth below is an up-to-date characterization of this organization

which replaces the one in SAC Letter 63-39. This thumbnail sketch

also encompasses the Progressive Labor Party and the Movement's

publication, "Progressive Labor," which are integral parts of the

entire organization.

PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY;

@PROGRESSIVE LABOR MOVEMENT;

¡ "PROGRESSIVE LABOR"

A source advised on July 2, 1962, that Progressive Labor

groups held a conference in New York City on July 1, 1962,

Milton Rosen acted as chairman.

He read a statement at this con-

ference setting forth their intention to form a new Marxist-Leninist

Party in the United States. Rosen stated that a

• more formal

organization was necessary, one which would provide a framework for

all who wanted to join in a united effort to build an American

vanguard. The functions of this new organization are to consolidate

all existing forces around Progressive Labor and organize additional

lorces; expand and improve political activities; win additional forces

to an outlook of Marxism-Leninism and increase

the open advocacy of

socialism; develop a significant Marxist-Leninist program for the

new party; and organize a collective organization of leaders and

members.

"The Worker," an east coast communist

newspaper, issue of January 7, 1962,

page 10, column 3, reported the

expulsion of Milton Rosen, former

labor secretary of the New York

State Communist Party, from the

Communist Party, USA.

A second and third source advised in February, 1963,

that this new Marxist-Leninist Party had not yet been organized on

a formal basis but that Progressive Labor groups had been formed

in several localities in line with proposals of Milton Rosen.

The

sources advised as of February, 1963, that the leaders of this group

were referring to it as the Progressive Labor Movement.

The "Amsterdam News," a daily New York City newspaper, dated

July 27, 1963, page 22, set forth that the

•"Progressive Labor Party

is a new political formation based on Progressive Labor Movement,

a Socialist organization with groups in all parts of the United

States.

The organization publishes a monthly magazine called

Progressive Labor.

The July-August, 1963, issue of Progressive Labor" set

forth that it is published monthly by Progressive Labor Company,

The NOI Is an all-Negro organization which was

originally organized in 1930 in Detroit, Michigan. Muhammad

claims to have been selected by Allah,

the Supreme Being, to

lead the so-called

Negro race out of slavery in the wilderness

of North America by establishing an Independent black nation in

the United States. Members following Muhammad's teaching and

his interpretation of the "Koran" believe there is no such

thing as a Negro; that the so-called Negroes are slaves of the

white race, referred to as

"white devils," in the United States;

and that the white race, because of its

exploitation of the

so-called Negroes,

must

and will be destroyed in the approaching

"War of Armageddon."

In the past, officials and members of the NOI, in-

of the Selective Service Acts and have declared that members

owe no allegiance to the United States.

of 15 and 19 and who are afforded military-type drill.

Since 1957, various officers and "sisters" of the MGI

have, at meetings of

the MGT, used the term MGT so that it also

means General Civilization Class. General Civilization Class

refers to classes conducted within the MGT.

The above refers to activities of the MGT at Muhammad's

Temple of Islam No. 2, 5335 South Greenwood, Chicago, Illinois.

On May 17, 1961, another source advised that the MGI

is a group within the NOI

which is composed of all female members

of the NOI. The MGT is similar in structure to the FOI, which

is composed of male members of the NOI.

In theory, the MGT exists

in all Temples of the NOI and is patterned after the MGT at

Muhammad's lemple of Islam No. 2, Chicago:

(F.). NATIONALITY GROUP COVERAGE - CUBA -- On February 13, 1961,

the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) communicated

with all of its Regional Offices. It expressed the opinion that

aliens and naturalized citizens currently active In the July 26th

Movement or related organizations whose activities may be in

furtherance of or dedicated to the cause of Fidel Castro are

subject to INS investigative jurisdiction, after clearance with

the FBI, to determine amenability to INS proceedings under

specified sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

Each field office should assure that all pertinent data

relating to such individuals is referred on a continuing basis

to the appropriate local office of INS in order that action by

INS looking toward possible exclusion, deportation, expatriation

or denaturalization may be properly considered.

You will note that INS investigative action in these

matters requires specific clearance with the FBI. In view of

INS objectives and in view of the tense Cuban situation clearance

should be granted upon request unless INS investigation of a

particular individual would definitely interfere with a pending

investigation or jeopardize your own interests in an individual.

When clearance for INS investigation is not granted the Bureau

should be advised promptly by airtel under the caption of the

Individual case of

the denial and the reasons therefor.

Any

pending action which prompts the denial should be expedited in

order that clearance can be granted INS as soon as practical.

When granting clearance for INS investigative action be certain

that arrangements are effected whereby you will be advised by

INS of pertinent data developed and of any proceedings instituted

regarding subjects of interest to your office.

In one local office of INS the INS instructions were

Interpreted to call for an investigation of the July 26th

movement organization. This interpretation was incorrect. You

will recognize, however, that some local offices of INS, in

order to implement their instructions, may request data

regarding

the July 26th Movement and other organizations supporting the

Castro cause. Pertinent data should be supplied.

Any problems experienced by field offices in connection

with INS activities in this regard

should be brought to the

attention of the Bureau promptly.

It was explained

that, for the most part,

this restriction was due to the preponder-

ance of EGIS efforts being directed against West Germany and partly

due to a lack of confidence on the part of the Soviets in East

German efforts both from a political reliability and capability

standpoint.

In the recent past, CIA has now received indications

which lead it to believe the Soviets have increased confidence in

EGIS and are encouraging it to extend operations worldwide.

Although the preponderance of EGIS activities will possibly

continue to be directed against West Germany, EGIS now has the

capability and Soviet approval to direct activities against the

Western Hemisphere.

However, he did not indicate any fundamental

liquidating itself by departing from the Marxist precepts of Leon

Trotsky and retreating from the fight for the world socialist

revolution. The final issue which ultimately forced the split

involved cooperation with the Communist Party (CP) periphery -

individuals characterized by the minority as petty-bourgeois.

The minority program, according to the source, advocates

the unconditional defense of the Soviet Union and has as its goal

the building of a revolutionary party with a complete proletarian

orientation for the purpose of overthrowing capitalism in the United

(C) IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE - OCCUPATIONAL AND

GEOGRAPHICAL INDEX - IMMIGRANTS AND REPATRIATES FROM USSR AND

SATELLITE COUNTRIES - Immigration and Naturalization Service

(INS) has now begun to maintain an occupational and geographical

Index for aliens who have recently arrived in the United States.

Each alien entering the United States for permanent residence

and each alien applying for naturalization is requested to fill

out a card

setting forth his occupation and previous residence

in his native country. Thus far, there are a very small number

of cards for certain countries.

The index cards do not show

the alien's United States address and it will, therefore, be

necessary to check at the local INS office where the alien's file

is maintained to obtain his last known address.

This index may

be of some assistance to the Bureau, particularly in investigations

of immigrants and

repatriates under

Section 105E, Manual of In-

structions, since It may be possible to locate an individual in

the United

States who was acquainted with a particular subject

In a soviet-bloc country.

Personnel limitations at INS, how-

ever, will require that

this index be utilized on a selective

basis.

It should be used only in cases which cannot be resolved

by other investigation.

In immigrant and repatriave cases li,

following interview of the subject, no conclusion can be reached

as to whether he may have been given an intelligence assignment,

consideration should be given to use of the index to attempt to

locate an individual who may be able to verify or refute the

alleged background of subject or statements made by him.

• Leads to check this index should be set out by the

office of origin for WFO and sufficient information should be

included to show the relative importance of the information

desired. If in the opinion of WFO a lead is not justified in

the light of the volume and merits of other such leads being

received, it should advise Bureau and requesting office that

it will not be covered unless advised to the contrary by the

Bureau.

WFO will ascertain

whether any individuals are listed

who may know subject and, if so,

will furnish office of örigin

with their names, INS numbers and the location of the INS offices

where their immigration files are

maintained. The office of

origin will then set out any logical leads to have

such

individuals located and interviewed.

USE OF CURRENT INFORMANT TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL HIGH-LEVEL

COVERAGE IN THE COMMUNIST PARTY (CP) USA

In order to insure continuation of high-level

informant coverage in the CPUSA, all offices having informants

on a district level or higher should consider utilizing one

or more of such informants to bring along new informants in

the Party. This will be accomplished through the cooperation

of the high-level informant who

will be told that he will be

contacted by another informant.

The new informant will not

know the individual he is contacting is an FBI informant.

The high-level informant will then introduce the new informant

to Party functionaries, et cetera, eventually working him into

top Party activity.

Through this

• plan the CP leadership will

grow to trust the new informant and in a relatively short

time we should be able to continue our high-level coverage

should happen to our current top

informant.

YOUTH PROGRAM OF THE CPUSA

At the 17th National Convention of the CPUSA held

In New York City December 12-14, 1959, the CPUSA set up a

program which was designed to produce a communist youth

Secretary for Youth, and Rubin has been touring a large part

of the United States in order to complete the organization

of a communist youth group.

This organization will encompass

all classes of young people, including college students. The

Party hopes that in addition to other groups it will eventually

have communist youth groups on college campuses.

All offices were alerted to this program by letter

of June 21, 1960, entitled "CPUSA, Youth Matters, Internal

Security - C" and to the necessity to have complete coverage

of CP activity in youth matters.

The Party is expected shortly

to establish this youth organization, and we must be ready Iox

the location of any youth groups set up anywhere in the country.

Consideration should be given to making contacts with coopera-

tive officials of Institutions of learning so that we may

become aware of the emergence on campuses of groups dominated

by the CP.

In addition, through a review of campus publi-

cations information may be elicited concerning the formation of

communist youth groups on campuses.

The Party is keenly

aware of the need to develop an effective program among youth,

and you should be alert to develop and maintain the necessary

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM

Any office where there is any degree of concen-

tration of communists (although not a regular participant

in the Program) should consider the possible application

of counterintelligence techniques specifically aimed at

causing disruption or disillusionment inside Party circles.

Bureau approval must be obtained before any action can be

taken.

All proposals must be carefully evaluated prior to

submission so it can clearly be stated that the action

(DY! CIVIL SERVICE RETIREMENT BENEFITS - - Public Law 87-793 approved

October 11, 1962, liberalized in several respects the retirement

benefits granted by the Civil Service Retirement Act.

benefits await implementation by Congressional appropriation of the

necessary funds. This cannot occur until the 88th Congress convenes

In January, 1963. Legislation will then be introduced looking

toward appropriation of such funds.

The new benefits relate mainly to upward adjustment in

amount of annuity and to increased survivor protection.

Provisions which would affect the amount of annuity

include:

(1) The annuity of each retired employee and survivor annuitant

receiving or eligible to receive

an annuity on January 1, 1963, would

be increased 5 per cent. Annuities commencing between January 2,

and December

31, 1963, would be increased 4 per cent; those com-

mencing during 1964, 3 per cent; those commencing during 1965, 2

per cent; and those commencing during 1966, 1 per cent.

(2) Beginning in January, 1964, yearly changes in the nation-

wide cost of living will be reviewed by the Civil Service Commission

and whenever the cost of living rises at least 3 per cent, annuities

will be further increased by a percentage matching the rise in the

cost of living.

(3) The reduction in an employee's annuity to provide for a survivor

annuity will be changed from 22 per cent of the first $2400, plus

10 per cent of the balance to 25 per cent of the first $3000, plus

10 per cent of the balance.

This will apply, once Congress appropriates

funds, to all retiring employees

separated on or after October 11,

1962, with an annuity commencing

after that time.

The May 2 Movement (MM) formerly known as the

May 2 Committee was organized on March 14, 1964, at New Haven,

Connecticut, by a group of young people participating in a

symposium "Socialism in America" being held at Yale University.

The original aim of the M2M was to plan and execute a demon-

stration in New York City on May 2,

1964, demanding withdrawal

of United States

troops from Vietnam.

The M2M was dominated and controlled by the

Progressive Labor Party (PLP) and had for its aim and purpose

the embarrassment of the United States Government by meetings,

rallies, picketing demonstrations and formation of university

level clubs at which a Marxist-leninist oriented approach and

analysis was taken of United States domestic and foreign

policies.

This source advised on May 19, 1965, that the

headquarters of the M2M was 640 Broadway, New York City,

Room 307.

Juan Mari Bras, the founder and dominant leader of this organ-

in a speech during

March, 1964, threatened violence

comparable to that in Algeria it puerto Rico became a state

The

• MGT is similar in structure to the Fruit of Islam

(FOI),

which is

composed of male members of the NOI, in that the

MGI members receive instructions in homemaking, history and

calisthenics and other subjects such as Muslim

the English language.

There also exists a Junior MGT, which

is composed of female members of the NOI who are between the

ages of 15 and 19 and who are afforded military-type drill.

Since 1957, various officers and "sisters" of the

MGt have, at meetings of the MGI, used the term MGT so that

it also means General Civilization Class.

General Civilization

Class refers to classes conducted within

the MGT.

The above refers to activities of the MGT at Muhammad's

Temple of Islam No. 2, 5335 South Greenwood Avenue, Chicago,

Illinois.

The NOI is an all-Negro organization which was

originally organized in 1930 in Detroit, Michigan.

Muhammad

claims to have been seiected by Allah,

the Supreme Being, to

lead the so-called Negro race out of

slavery in the wilderness

of North America by establishing an independent black nation

in the United

States,

Members following Muhammad's

teachings

and his interpretation of the "Koran" believe there is no such

thing as a Negro; that the

so-called Negroes are slaves of the

white race, referred to as "white devils," in the United States;

and that the white race, because of its exploitation of the

so-called Negroes,

and will be destroyed in the approaching

"War of Armageddon."

In the past, officials and members of the NOI,

including Muhammad, have refused to register under the provisions

of the Selective Service Acts and have declared that members

owe no allegiance to the United States.

On May

5, 1y5o, the first source advised that Muhammac

nad, upon advice of legal counsel, tempered his personal

119591

statements and instructions to his ministers concerning the

principles of his organization in order to avoid possible

prosecution by the United States Government; however, he did not

indicate any fundamental changes in the teachings of

his organi-

zation.

On May 2, 1966, a third source advised that Muhammad

had, early in July, 1958, decided to de-emphasize the religious

aspects of the teachings of Islam and to stress the economic

benefits to be derived by those Negroes who joined the NOI.

This policy change, according to Muhammad, would help him

acquire additional followers and create more interest in his

programs.

A second source advised in May, 1964, that the

Communist Party (CP) interest in NCRMA had been to give it

full support and approval, and the CP took the position that

the committee's composition must be extremely broad and the

Party's direct influence must be kept to a minimum.

policy

differences on varied issues concerning tactics and interpretation

of political events, split from the SWP on the grounds that the

Party was liquidating itself by departing from the Marxist

precepts of Leon Trotsky and retreating from the fight for

The final issue which ultimately

forced the split was the minority's opposition to the SWP

regroupment policy which involved cooperation with the

by the minority as petty-bourgeois.

declaration of YSA.

This declaration stated that the YSA

1et doctors

recognizes the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) as the only

existing political leadership on class struggle principles,

and that the supporters of theis have come into basic political

solidarity with the SWP on the principles of revolutionary

socialism.

A source advised on May 23, 1966, that the original

YSA was an organization formed during October, 1957, in

of the national organization.

The source further advised on May 23, 1966, that

the YSA is dominated and controlled on a national basis by

the SWP through having SWP members comprise exclusively

the National Executive Committee (NEC). The YSA, in reality,

(A) REPORT WRITING - MAPS -- As the result of a suggestion the following

technique is being brought to your attention to be considered for use in reports

wherein it is necessary to describe or pinpoint a particular locality. Briefly

the technique consists in mechanical reproduction of the pertinent portion of an

official state road map for inclusion in the first part of a bank robbery, bank

burglary, or other major case report. The item should be inserted in the

first report submitted suitably captioned and depicting the location and

description of the establishment or location where the crime was committed.

Pertinent points of interest or importance should be circled and numbered or

lettered. These markings should be explained on the same page if sufficient

space exists. The marking should be done after reproduction and ink or lead

other than black or blue black should be used as these colors tend to obliterate

the existing printed items on the map. Official state road maps should be

used to avoid infringement of copyrights.

This method is used most effectively to determine locales in

sparsely populated, rural or remote areas with less than the usual distinguish-

ing features or points of reference; however, it will be of value in any type

of case where knowledge of the locale is of benefit to the reader of the report.

Where the technique is applicable, it is plain that it will save considerable

time which would be needed to sketch or verbally describe a particular location.

(SSC) request for access to all indices and control files

the present, we made available for review at FbIHo by

SSC Staff Members, an index covering all SAC Letters and

selected approximately 340 SAC Letters and Memoranda which

the SSC now seeks

review at FBIHQ (see attached SSC

request).

Many of the selected SAC Letters and Memoranda

cover more than one subject matter and originated with

more than one FBIHQ Division. A review of the requested

material by all originating Divisions would be extremely

time-consuming and would substantially delay our response

to the SSC in/ this matter.

As a practical matter we propose having all the

requested SAC Letters and Memoranda reviewed by the INTD

SENSTUDY staff for clearance. Questionable material re

quiring consultation with other Divisions will be furnished

to such Divisions's SENSTUDY representative for appropriate

Within

INTD we will secure Sectional

clearance,

as required, for

questionable material.

ACTION:

Upon processing the SAC Letters and Memoranda as

described above, we will than make such material available

to SSC Staff Members for review at FBIHQ. This will be

handled in accordance with established procedure by letter

to the Attorney General™

with

an LHM for the SSC.

(C) FIRST LATIN AMERICAN CONGRESS OF JOURNALISTS -- Accord-

ing to current press reports, Fidel Castro is planning still another major

anti-U. S. propaganda spectacle scheduled to be known as the First Latin

American Congress of Journalists and planned for July 28, 1968, to

August 1, 1968, ir Havana. Reportedly, Latin American writers and

newsmen will form the nucleus of the Congress but press representatives

from Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America also will be invited. Radio

Havana, one of the Cuban Government's chief propaganda outlets, has

announced the theme of the Congress as "Anti-imperialism, " and delegates

are to ke journalists who view the Congress as a powerful stimulus to the

revolutionary struggles in their home countries. In keeping with the goals

outlined at the July, 1967, Latin American Solidarity Organization

Conference and the January, 1968, Cultural Congress, the forthcoming

meeting can logically be expected to close with the adoption of resolutions

exhorting the overthrow of the U. S. Government through violent, armed

revolutionary action.

It is anticipated that many U. S. apologists for the Castro

regime will attend and that some legitimate U. S. newsmen will be allowed

to cover open sessions of the Congress. Many will probably travel with-

out Department of State authority and under current regulations will not

be subjected to punitive action by the U.S. In the recent past, however,

the. Mexican Government has been quite helpful by denying transit visas

to communists and other subversives who wish to travel from the U. S.

through Mexico to Cuba, thereby forcing them to assume the additional

expense of traveling by way of Prague, Czechoslovakia, to get to Cuba

or abandoning their efforts altogether after having paid travel and living

expenses for a futile round trip to Mexico.

In view of the possibility that the Mexican Government may desire

to deny transit visas to U. S. subversives attempting to attend the Congress,

we contemplate having Legal Attache, Mexico City, relay pertinent names

to appropriate Mexican officials. All offices be alert to any information

showing known subversives or other individuals who can be fully documented

as members of subversive organizations are planning to travel to Cuba

for the Congress or for the celebration on the anniversary of Fidel Castro's

1953 attack on the Moncada Barracks in Santiago, Cuba, which will be held

on July 26, 1968. Furnish the identity of any such traveler by expedite

communication to the Bureau and include therein a very succinct resume

of his subversive affiliations. Also provide the names, descriptions,

or symbol numbers of the sources who can substantiate the documentation

and any available information concerning the prospective visitor's travel

document and itinerary which will aid;

desires to take action

Offices also be alert to our need for firsthand coverage of the

Congress and make positive recommendations concerning advance briefing

and/or debriefing of logical prospects for attendance at the Congress.

If any special security factors exist, outline them in the initial communi-

cation containing your recommendations.

Very truly yours,

(D) CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES AT 1968 OLYMPIC GAMES IN MEXICO

CITY - FOREIGN POLICE COOPERATION -- Mexican authorities have

expressed deep concern that criminals from the United States and other

countries will be attracted to the 1968 Olympic Games to be held in

Mexico City from October 12, 1968, through October 27, 1968, and have

asked for the cooperation of the FBI in furnishing them any information

regarding the identity and plans including travel of any such persons.

All offices should alert appropriate sources concerning

this matter and promptly advise the Bureau of any information received

under the above caption.

In view of the fact that data reported will

require translation, no letterhead memoranda should be prepared.

Instead, information should be furnished by letter or airtel depending

on urgency. It should incorporate complete descriptive data including

particular criminal specialties, Bl number and photograph, ii

available, and any other data of interest to Mexican authorities.

Arrangements have been made by the Legal Attache, Mexico

City, for concealment of the FBI as the source of information for any

data disseminated. Information forwarded to the Legal Attache by the

Bureau will be made available to Mexican authorities concerned with the

maintenance of law and order and immigration.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

Director

WASHINGTON, D.G. 20535

• September 20, 1968

(A) CHARACTERIZATION OF SUBVERSIVE, RACIAL, KLAN, WHITE

HATE, AND MILITANT BLACK ORGANIZATIONS - INTERNAL

SECURITY - COMMUNIST --

Set forth below are up-to-date thumbnail sketches

of organizations and publications, each of which is of use to

various field offices.

No attempt has been made to include

all sketches which have been furnished to the Bureau for

approval; only those sketches which are believed to have

field-wide application are set forth.

In the event an office needs to characterize an

organization not mentioned in either this letter or the

various issues of the "Guide to Subversive Organizations

and

Publications" published by the House Committee on

Un-American Activities, or one not designated by the

Attorney General pursuant to Executive Order 10450; a request

should be made of

the office of origin to furnisn the required

characterization. In describing a local affiliate of a

national organization, in addition to characterizing the

local affiliate, it will be necessary to set forth separately

the characterization of the parent organization.

composed of persons belonging to the now defunct 26th of

July Movement, a revolutionary organization founded and led

by Fidel Castro, Prime Minister of Cuba, until its dissolution

in 1962.

A second source advised that the CCC, originally

founded as a social club of New York area residents of

Cuban extraction, was sympathetic to Castro during his

struggle for power.

Subsequent to January 1, 1959, as it

became apparent that communism was the form of government

in Cuba, the leaders of the 26th of July Movement assumed

control

of CCC and its membership declined.

The first

source above advised that Casa de las

Americas is also ostensibly formed as a social club, but in

effect it acts as a focal point for revolutionary peoples

sympathetic to the Cuban Government.

Although it is not

directly controlled by the Cuban Mission to the United Nations

(CMUN), many Cuban personnel attend its functions and at

least an indirect link with CMUN is present: Casa de las

Americas has fund-raising affairs and contributes money to the

CMUN. Casa de las Americas also gives financial support to

other revolutionary groups representing countries other than

Cuba. Through CMUN, various propaganda materials of a

communist nature are found at Casa de las Americas.

This

same source also stated that some executive committee members,

as well as general members of Casa de las Americas, are members

of the Spanish Section of the Communist Party, United States

of America (CPUSA) .

An indirect link does

occur at Casa de

las Americas in that it is used as a staging ground prior

to entry into CPUSA.

Further, source indicates that

membership in Casa de las Americas serves as an excellent

background for persons desiring to return to Cuba.

This same source stated that, although there

exists in Cuba, a social club called Casa de las Americas

supported by the Cuban Government, there appears to be no

organization in Mississippi and never getting anything in

in the International

a world Trotskyist organization. It accused the leadership of

adopting views of those within the FI who favored "bureaucratic"

revolution over the genuine "revolutionary working class: outlook"

of Leon trotsky. Domestically, the Hohlforth faction opposea

sip orientation toward student activity, feeling the farty shoula

place major emphasis on trade unions and

participation in the

civil rights struggle.

Although tolerated for some time, the Wohlforth group

was expelled from the SWP in July, 1964.

Following expulsion, the Wolforth group formed the

American Committee

for

the Fourth International and planned to

work with other radical and militant organizations,

concentrating

on the civil rights movement, which to them is a basic "class"

struggle.

More recently, the group has devoted time and effort

to its call for an American labor party, which in its view will

enable the working class to exert its latent political power.

It plans to build a political party around a publication and

classes of instruction in Marxism.

During November, 1966, the organization's name was

changed to Workers League. Headquarters is 243 East 10th Street,

that the Party was liquidating itself by departing from the

RE:

CHARACTERIZATION OF SUBVERSIVE, RACIAL, KLAN,

WHITE HATE, AND MILITANT BLACK

ORGANIZATIONS

The "Young Socialist" maintains office space

at the headquarters of the YSA, Room 532-536, 41 Union

Square West, New York City, and has a mailing address

of Post Office Box 471, Cooper Station, New York, New York

YOUNG SOCIALIST ALLIANCE

The May, 1960, issue of the "Young Socialist" (YS),

Page 1, Column 3, disclosed that during April 15-17, 1960, a

national organization entitled "The Young Socialist Alliance"

(YSA) was established at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This

issue stated that this organization was formed by the nationwide

supporter clubs of the publication yS.

The above issue, page 6, set forth the Founding

Declaration of the YSA.

YSA recognizes the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) as the only

existing political leadership on class struggle principles,

and that the supporters of the Ys have come into basic political

solidarity with the SWP on the principles of revolutionary

socialism.

On March 10, 1967, a source advised that the YSA was

formed during 1957, by youth of various left socialist tenden-

cies, particularly

members and followers of the SWP. The

source further advised that the YSA has recently become more

open about admitting that it is the youth group of the SHP

and that an SiP representative has publicly stated that the YSA

is the SW's youth group.

The National Headquarters of the YSA are located

in Room 532-536, 41 Union Square West, New York City.

On October 31, 1967, a second source advised that

at the 22nd National Convention of the SWP held in New York City

members.

The SWP has been designated pursuant

to Executive Order 10450.

YOUTH AGAINST WAR AND FASCISM (YATE)

A source advised on March 29, 1965, that the Youth

Against Har and Fascism, IOrmerly known as the Anti-fascist

Youth Committee, was established by the workers "orld Party (WHP)

in the summer of 1962, to bring college and high school youth

into the periphery of

WHP activities and thereby gain recruits

for the organization.

A second source advised on October 23, 1964, that a

flyer distributed by the YAiF describes that organization as

a militant organization of young workers and worker-students

for combating war and lascism.

The first source advised on May 1, 1968, that the

YAYF maintains its headquarters at 58 West 25th Street, New

York City and publishes a magazine called "The Partisan."

(B) BUREAU CODES - SECURITY OF COMMUNICATIONS -- It has béen

called to the Bureau's attention that one field office has been following the

undesirable procedure of posting on the AFSAM 7 code machine daily, when

the rotor settings are changed, the "date group," followed by "indicator

rotor alignment."

Transposition of use of these components in encoding messages

has resulted in violation of Bureau's regulations designed to prevent

compromise of the AFSAM 7 coding system.

V

If followed in your office, discontinue this procedure, posting on

the AFSAM 7 code machine only the "indicator rotor alignment, " the

numerals for the day of the month, and the initials of the employee posting

this information on the code machine. The "date group" may be posted

elsewhere but not in the immediate vicinity of the code machine where it

can be confused with the "indicator rotor alignment."

(C) FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY ASSOCIATES RETRAINING SESSIONS FOR

1967 -- Advise the Bureau, Attention: Training Division, by June 1, 1967,

the dates and places of your 1967 retraining sessions for graduates of the

FBI National Academy. If your retraining session will be held in advance of

that date, Bureau should be given at least 30 days' notice. The Bureau should

be furnished with the detailed program to be followed, and your personal

attention should be given to the planning of these sessions to make certain that

the emphasis is on subject matter of value and interest to the graduates who

will attend.

All correspondence should be directed to the Bureau, Attention:

Training Division, and should be submitted on an unless-advised-to-the-contrary-

by-Bureau (UACB) basis.

You are reminded that in July, 1967, there will be a Sectional

• Retraining Session in Section I (Western

States) from July 16 - 19 at the Brown

Palace Hotel in Denver, Colorado. There should be no regularly scheduled

chapter retraining sessions held in Section I during 1967. Graduates from the

13 Western States as well as from the rest of the chapters should be invited to

participate, as always, in your field firearms training programs, police schools

and other Bureau functions.

To assist the host chapter in Denver, each Special Agent in Charge of

field offices located in states making up Section I should make certain that all

eligible graduates in their territories are aware of the retraining session in

Denver and have notified the secretary of their own chapter whether they expect

to attend. All SACs should be aware that any graduate in good standing is

welcome to attend Sectional Retraining Sessions in any section. Any graduate

expecting to attend the retraining session in Denver should be advised to make

proper reservations through the host chapter without delay. The results achieved

at the four Sectional Retraining Sessions held in 1965 and 1966 were most gratifying,

and I expect the personal attention of each SAC to stimulate interest in this

important FBI National Academy program.

D) ESPIONAGE AND FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS - TO

compensate for the curtailment of confidential investigative techniques, which

may continue indefinitely, there is an imperative need to strengthen live source

coverage in the espionage and foreign intelligence fields.

Seat of Government supervision of these matters indicates greater

emphasis must be placed on development of confidential sources who are in

a position to furnish the operational information concerning the movements,

activities, and contacts of a subject which in the past has often been provided

by confidential techniques. Consider neighbors, fellow employees, tradesmen,

and other persons who are able and willing to furnish, on a confidential basis,

information available to them because of their position in relation to a subject.

In each investigation, carefully analyze what information is needed, what persons

may be able to provide it and which of them may be approached. In every such

case, the Agent and Supervisor should consciously consider whether all reasonable

effort has been expended along these lines.

Seek confidential sources whose information can complement other

: ivestigative measures such as, for example, to indicate when physical

surveillances could be most productive or where they could be initiated from

remote points.

Hereafter, in contacts with such confidential sources you should overlook

no opportunities to develop them as informants. If, as a result of their continued

relationship with the Bureau, they prove willing to go out of their way to cultivate

or ingratiate themselves with a subject, they may be able to contribute extremely

valuable information. Any person willing to engage actively in observing and

furnishing information should be considered for development as a potential security

informant.

Due to the urgency of our needs, background investigations of both

confidential sources and potential informants must be completed without delay.

Due to the sensitive nature of these investigations, preliminary pretext interviews

will often be necessary to appraise the cooperativeness of prospective live sources.

The same Agent who will subsequently handle a live source should not, of course,

conduct the pretext interview if this technique will thereby be revealed.

During forthcoming field office inspections emphasis will be placed

not only on the number and quality of informants and potential informants

developed by each Agent but also on the number and quality of confidential

sources developed and on the overall adequacy of coverage in individual cases

assigned to each Agent. In reviewing case files, the Inspection Staff will

evaluate whether the investigation being conducted is producing the substantive

information required to resolve the case and whether proper initiative is

being exercised to this end. The Inspection Staff will inquire specifically

into cases where shortcomings are found and such inquiries will include

individual interviews with the Agent and Supervisor responsible.

The Bureau continues to have full responsibility for penetrating

foreign intelligence operations and uncovering the activities of foreign agents,

and it must meet these responsibilities with those investigative procedures

which are available.

(A) FIREARMS EQUIPMENT AND TRAINING -- Recently, in two field

divisions, firearms were accidentally discharged while being handled by

Special Agents. These occurrences clearly indicate a lack of proper caution

in the use of firearms and the need to stress safety measures in handling

them. In order to prevent any further such serious incidents, all Special

Agents should be reminded of the absoluce necessity of exercising extreme

caution at all times and of complying carefully with Bureau instructions in

handling both Bureau and personally owned firearms. In addition, all

Special Agents should be warned that they are not to familiarize themselves

with firearms in field offices.

SAC LETTER 67-6

• (B) RESIDENT AGENTS - TRANSFER MATTERS -- You are reminded that

in view of expenses involved in transferring personnel complete justification

must be furnished in recommending assignment of an agent to a resident

agency and only those agents who unquestionably possess the proper attri-

butes considered essential in order to function properly in a resident agency •

should be considered. Recommendations for multiple transfers should

• be avoided. In connection with first-office agents, recommendations for

transfers to resident agencies should be kep: at an absolute minimum and

when submitted should reflect careful consideration of all factors including

experience of agent involved, marital status and any factors affecting costs.

Bear in mind that first-office agents must first participate in six weekly

conferences and that they will be considered for rotation to another office

after approximately one year.

The designation "headquarters fixed" with respect to resident

agents is being abolished and all agents assigned to a resident agency are

being designated resident agents. In those cases where no Alternate Senior

Resident Agent has been approved because of his present designation as a

"headquarters fixed" agent, you should submit recommendations on a

UACB basis.

(C) IDENTIFICATION RECORDS - ARREST DISPOSITIONS -- Manual of

Instructions provides disposition of all arrests on FBI Identification Records

involving a fugitive should be obtained promptly during course of investigation;

further, that all dispositions on Identification Records must be accounted for

on arrests of Bureau subjects in all cases wherein prosecution has been

authorized. (Volume II, Section 49, page 5 and Volume I, Section 7, page 13.)

Your attention also is directed to SAC Letter 66-74 dated November 29,

1966, which stressed necessity for prompt submission of final disposition data

to Identification Division for which arrest fingerprint cards have previousiy

been forwarded. Currently, you are discussing disposition procedures with

an appropriate official of each law enforcement agency in your territory and

have been instructed to advise the Bureau when this program is completed.

To further emphasize necessity for submission of final arrest disposition

data for FBI Identification Records, Bureau is considering other measures to

insure our records are up to date and as complete as possible in every instance.

In this regard you should conduct a three-month survey commencing February 1,

1967, and ending April 30, 1967, as follows:

In addition to obtaining final arrest disposition data missing from

fingerprint entries on an FBI Identification Record as now provided by Manual

of Instructions in fugitive cases and cases where prosecution has been authorized,

you are to apply the same procedure to all other FBI Identification Records

received by your office during the pertinent period. This will include records

of suspects, applicants, informants, etc., either obtained by your submission

of fingerprints, a Bureau form such as FD-9 or FD-165 or by any other means.

Two computations should be maintained - one to show statistics and cost under

present system and another to report same information for records falling into

the new category. When results are received from all field offices, a decision

will be made as to whether this new procedure should be adopted on a permanent

basis. For your information, Identification Division will run a similar but

not a duplicate survey commencing February 1, 1967, in certain select cases.

It is presumed Form FD -10 will be used in most instances by the

field to obtain missing disposition data and this, of course, should be routed

to the Identification Division after pertinent information is noted in the field

office file. Since survey will end April 30, 1967, allow an additional 45 days

for replies to be received. Tabulate results and send them to Identification

Division with any comments you may wish to make concerning effectiveness of

program and problems encountered.

(D) DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION PERTAINING TO CORRUPTION --

In connection with your program of disseminating information to other

ters, that prior to undertaking dissemination, Bureau authority is obtained.

these publications will be furnished to all offices when they become available.

The Bureau reprint, "Science Fights Crime," which appeared

in the November, 1962, FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, and the reprint en-

titled "Science and Technology in Law Enforcement," which appeared in

(F) CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS - ACCOMPLISHMENTS -- You have been

aware for some time that the attitude of the courts toward the treatment of

defendants and the administration of the law would create a challenge for

the Bureau in connection with our investigative endeavors. You have been

reminded frequently of the many problems confronting you and of the necessity

to program your activities and to devise procedures which would obtain

the desired results. Despite repeated admonitions, few offices have risen

to the challenge.

Instances have been observed recently where U. S. Attorneys

procrastinate furnishing a prosecutive opinion. Effective immediately,

you should submit a letterhead memorandum to the Bureau in each case

where a U. S. Attorney has not rendered a prosecutive opinion within 30

days. This letterhead memorandum should set forth a brief summary

of the facts of the case, as well as the identities of the attorneys contacted,

the dates contacted, and the reason a prosecutive opinion was not

furnished.

These letterhead memoranda will be submitted to the

Department in order to speed up the judicial process, where justified.

The development of prosecutive cases is dependent upon a number

of factors, including adequate liaison with sources of cases; effective

utilization of your Agent manpower; prompt, thorough, imaginative in-

vestigative action; and timely, organized presentations to U. S. Attorneys.

Obviously, the entire process is initially dependent upon your ability to

establish procedures which will result in the prompt referral of cases

to your office. With this objective in mind the Bureau has closely followed

the activity of each office.

While the case figures submitted are encouraging,

the results obtained have not been commensurate. This strongly suggests

weak links exist somewhere in the process.

It is realized there are certain factors beyond your control

which contribute to the over-all problem but they are not considered

insurmountable. You will be held personally responsible to exhaust every

logical means in order to insure the Bureau compiles the best possible

record.

In 'äll future field office inspections there will be an analysis in

depth in order to pinpoint any weaknesses. Corrective measures will there-

after be suggested and, where appropriate, administrative action will be

considered.

(G) INVESTIGATIONS OF KLAN AND HATE-TYPE ORGANIZATIONS AND

ASSOCIATED INDIVIDUALS -- It is noted that many field divisions are

following the practice of advising the Bureau by teletype whenever intor-

mation is developed that Klan rallies, demonstrations, and the like are to

be held, even though there is no information indicating threatened or actual

violence.

In regard to the above, your attention is directed to Section 122B,

page 6, paragraph b, (1), Volume 4, Manual of Instructions, and part three,

page 154d, of the FBI Handbook, which set out "Information dealing with

general racial matters, such as proposed or actual activities of individuals,

officials, committees, legislatures, organizations, etc., in the racial field,

and information indicating threatened or actual violence by individuals or

organizations must be furnished to the Bureau on an expeditious and timely

basis by teletype or by whatever means of communication is warranted by

the specific nature of the information and circumstances invoived."

The practice of submitting teletypes advising the Bureau of

routine Klan rallies and other nonviolent Klan activities is causing an increase

in the expenses of this Bureau's operations. You must insure that Special

Agents of your division handling Klan investigations are thoroughly familiar

with the above instructions concerning appropriate communication advising

the Bureau of routine Klan activities. You should instruct the above Special

Agents that teletypes are not to be submitted to the Bureau on matters

which are obviously nonviolent in nature. Information relative to such

activity should be provided to the Bureau by airtel accompanied by a letter-

head memorandum suitable for dissemination. This practice will be in

keeping with Bureau instructions and in line with our current emphasis on

economy:

The foregoing does not modify in any manner the requirement

that the Bureau be expeditiously advised by teletype or by whatever means

of communication is warranted in cases involving acts of violence.

(H) SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION CHARACTERIZATION - AMERICAN

COMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION, THE COMMUNICATIONS DIVISION

OF THE INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS, CHAUF-

FEURS, WAREHOUSEMEN, AND HELPERS OF AMERICA - SAC Letter

66-56, dated September 7, 1966, provided a subversive organization

characterization for the American Communications Association (ACA).

This characterization of the ACA is being amended to show its merger with

the Teamsters Union. Set forth below is an up-to-date characterization

of the ACA which replaces the one in SAC Letter 66-56.

The "Report of the International Executive Board ACA, CIO"

at the Fifth National Convention, Chicago, Illinois, April 8 through 13,

1940, disclosed that the American Communications Association (ACA)

had its origin at the Third National Convention of the American Radio

Telegraphists Association (ARTA) held in New York City (NYC), in August,

1937. At this convention, it was agreed to change the name of the union

from ARTA to ACA. This change was ratified by the union members on

March 10, 1938.

The "Directory of National and International Labor Unions in

the United States, 1955," published by the United States Department of

Labor, lists on page four, unions expelled from the Congress of Industrial

Organizations (CIO) on charges of communist domination. The ACA was

listed as having been expelled on June 15, 1950.

The November, 1966, issue of the "ACA News," official publi-

cation of the ACA, the Communications Division of the International

Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen, and Helpers of

America (IBT), stated the affiliation of the ACA with the IBT was unani-

mously approved by the General Executive Board of the IBT, which met

in Hollywood, Florida, the week of October 17, 1966. The ACA was

designated as the Communications Division of the IBT. This issue of

the "ACA News" shows that the ACA, the Communications Division of

the IBT, is located at 18 John Street, New York, New York.

(A) COMMUNICATIONS - REFERENCES IN -- In order to eliminate unnecessary

indices searches in the field, your attention is directed to the instructions

contained in the Manual of Rules and Regulations, Part II, Section 4, item h

on page 10, which state with respect to references in communications:

•.. Under this heading describe a reference by type of communication, date,

detail that may be necessary to insure identification of the reference..."

These instructions are also contained in the Handbook for Special Agents,

Part I, Section 49, item & on page 45. If these provisions are followed by

offices sending communications, there should be no need for a receiving office

(B) CONTACTS WITH THE PUBLIC - SPEECH MATTERS - OPEN HOUSES -

SUGGESTIONS -- Field public appearance commitments (speeches, radio and

television appearances and Career Day talks) substantially increased during

calendar year 1966 with almost 2, 000 more handled than during 1965. While

a substantial portion of this increase resulted from the crediting of Career

Day talks, the overall advance reflects the wholehearted teamwork necessary

to properly present the Bureau's accomplishments to the public and I was

particularly encouraged to note the continued forceful SAC leadership of this

important program and the increased utilization of television and radio in

reaching mass audiences. This should be intensified during 1967.

I was also pleased to note the many offices holding open houses and

related affairs such as steak fries and special office tours to develop better

relations with valuable contacts and to provide families of employees with a

greater awareness of the Bureau's work. This should be further expanded,

with every office attempting to hold some such activity during 1967.

At this time, when the Bureau is under such careful scrutiny from

both hostile and legitimately interested sources, it is particularly important

to guard against any degree of complacency or lethargy and to take full

LN 55069

advantage of all opportunities to present to the public the solid accomplishments

(C) FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY ASSOCIATES - CONSTITUTION AND BYLAWS --

In November, 1966, you were furnished copies of the Constitution and Bylaws

of the FBI National Academy Associates which had been proposed to and ratified

by National Academy graduates in attendance at four Sectional Retraining

Sessions held in 1965 and 1966. The constitution and bylaws for any existing

state or regional chapter of the National Academy Associates must be amended

to conform to the National Constitution.

Certain existing chapter constitutions contain phraseology requiring

the approval of a certain percentage of graduates in attendance at a business

meeting to change or amend the chapter constitution. If it is not possible to

promptly amend the chapter constitution to conform to the National Constitution,

submission of an amended chapter constitution may be delayed until after the

first business meeting held by that chapter.

As soon as required changes have been made, a copy of the chapter

constitution should be furnished to the Bureau, Attention: National Academy

In addition to the courses of action outlined and referred to

therein, you should insure that this matter is highlighted in your police

schools, law enforcement conferences, FBI National Academy activities,

at meetings, conferences and conventions of law enforcement groups, and

in other official and personal contacts with police personnel. It should

be emphasized that such information provides to all strata of law enforcement

a more comprehensive, conclusive record of offenders which is of ultimate

benefit to all segments of our profession.

This matter should be brought to the attention of all Agents,

particularly police instructors, in order that they may promptly direct

their efforts toward implementing this program.

SAC LETTER 67-8

(E) BANK ROBBERY NATTERS PUBLICITY -- Several recent bank robbery

cases have been solved through appropriate publicity surrounding bank robbery

photographs taken by concealed cameras. In any bank robbery where such photo-

graphs are availabie, you must give them the widest possibie publicity in ali

news media; and each office, auring regular contacts with banking ofticials

and institutions, should encourage the installation of hidden cameras anci

similar protective devices. Upon subject's identification from a concealed

camera photograph, effective follow-up publicity can be obtained as is stown

in the attached example. I feel that this type of publicity in addition to wide-

spread coverage of convictions and sentencing operates as a strong deterrent

to bank robbery violations. Sy the time a defendant receives an appropriate

sentence in a bank robbery case, the SAC should have laid sufficient ground-

work for front-page-type coverage to follow.

This should not ke construed as a change in existing guidelines

regarding press releases; however, each SAC must encourage news media

contacts to give the widest possible publicity to bank robbery apprehensions,

convictions and substantial sentences.

(F) CUBAN REFUGEE MATTERS - INVESTIGATION TO DETECT

INTELLIGENCE AGENTS AMONG CUBAN REFUGEES - SAC Letter

61-13 (J), March 14, 1961, advised of arrangements made with Immigration

and Naturalization Service (INS) to furnish you copies of INS reports on

Cuban refugees in U. S. (INS Form SE-180 in Miami, Form I-161 elsewhere).

You were to review the reports and interview selected refugees in order to

develop intelligence data and informants.

The Castro government has utilized Cuban refugees as

intelligence agents in this country. Accordingly, we should endeavor,

through available means, to combat this problem. There are now an

estimated 300, 000 Cuban refugees in the U. S. with thousands more

awaiting entry. Over 50,000 have entered at Miami since December, 1965,

and many are being resettled from there to all parts of U. S.

A study of Cuban refugees recruited by Cuban Intelligence Service

(CIS) has revealed that in each case CIS took advantage of an available lever

to assure the refugee's cooperation. Any refugee who leaves a close relative

behind in Cuba is a possible target for CIS recruitment.

It is not desired that INS Cuban refugee reports previously received

be reexamined. However, future reports should be carefully reviewed as

received to spot refugees who, on basis of age, education or other background

factors should be considered for further attention. In absence of special

circumstances, refugees may be eliminated on basis of age, education and

lack of hostage situation. Refugees who are under 19 or over 45 years of age

may be disregarded as may refugees who are illiterate or who have had little •

or no formal education. Refugees without close relatives in Cuba may also

be disregarded.

If data in Cuban refugee report does not eliminate refugee from

further consideration as possible intelligence agent, institute preliminary

inquiry to include, at least, review of refugee's complete INS file and check

of office indices in areas where refugee has resided.

In these and other investigations of Cuban refugees be particularly

alert for following items: 1. Close relative is in prison in Cuba or was at

time refugee departed Cuba. 2. Close relative has been "integrated"' into

the revolution; that is, relative is an employee of Cuban Government at any

level and is openly supporting it. 3. Refugee was in prison in Cuba at any

time after Castro take-over.

4. Refugee has previously resided in U. S.

5. Refugee traveled to any communist country. 6. Refugee was formerly

employed by Castro government in civilian, diplomatic, or military

capacity. Y. Refugee has been involved in communist, pro-Castro, or

anti-U. S. activities. 8. Refugee is male in good health of military age.

If any of foregoing indicators appears in information developed,

initiate full investigations and advise Bureau. If refugee can be eliminated

as possible intelligence agent as result of the preliminary inquiry, case

may be closed.

If preliminary inquiry does not eliminate refugee as possible

intelligence agent, conduct additional investigation. This should include,

but not be limited to, check of Bureau and Central Intelligence Agency

(CIA) files and files and sources of Miami and New York offices. Upon

completion of logical additional investigation and in the absence of any of the

above-named indicators, consider interview of refugee before closing case.

Interviews may be conducted on SAC authority unless refugee is student or

is employed in news, entertainment, public, educational, or religious fields

or is labor leader or prominent person, in which case interviews must be

approved by Bureau. In each case where additional investigation is conducted

advise Bureau.

Where investigation is conducted on basis of one or more of

foregoing indicators, consideration must be given to interviewing refugee

after all logical investigation has been conducted. Bureau authority must

be obtained for the interview.

Inquiries concerning Cuban refugees must be discreet so as

not to prematurely alert an intelligence agent and to avoid giving impression

we are harassing legitimate refugees.

After trial period of six months from date of this SAC Letter,

Chicago, Miami, Newark, New York, and Tampa Offices are to submit

comments, observations, and recommendations as to continuance of

these procedures together with suggestions regarding any improvements

or modifications. Any other office desiring to do so may also submit

suggestions and observations. You will be appropriaily advised if changes

are to be made in the procedures. Otherwise provisions of this SAC

Letter will remain in effect.

(G) CUBAN INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES -

INTERNAL SECURITY - CUSA -- SAC Letter 60-6 (B), January 28,

1960, alerted you to the danger of infiltration of our Cuban counter-

intelligence operations through plants, staged defections, and double

agents. Recent Cuban Intelligence Service (CIS) activities in the U. S.

confirmed that this is still an objective of the Castro government and

emphasized the continuing necessity for vigilance in this respect.

A Cuban refugee who is cooperating with us as a double agent

against CIS activity emanating from the Cuban Mission to the United Nations

(CMUN) was advised by his principal there in late Decemoer, 1966, to

admit, if he were interviewed by the FBI or Central Intelligence Agency

(CIA), that he had been in contact with the CMUN. The principal instructed

the refugee to report such interview immediately so that the refugee could

be used by the principal as a double agent against the U. S. Government.

In January, 1967; CIA advised it suspected that a Cuban refugee ostensibly

under its control in Miami had been activated by the CIS for a mission

against CIA.

The aggressive nature of current and the prospect of increased

CIS activity in the U. S. are illustrated by recent CMUN action to obtain

legitimately city telephone directories for the State of Florida. It can be

expected that the directories will be used to facilitate and expand CIS

activity there and elsewhere. The potential threat to our double agent and

• other Cuban operations is obvious.

You should assure that security informants and confidential

sources in Cuban matters are reliable, that maximum data is obtained from

them and others without revealing extent or details of FBI investigations

regarding Cuban matters, and that contacts with individuals concerning the

Cuban situation are handled in a circumspect manner. At all times be most

vigilant to the possibility that the source could be a plant.

SAC LETTER 67-8

(H) "MINUTEMEN"- INFORMATION CONCERNING (INTERNAL

SECURITY) -- Robert B. DePugh, National Coordinator of the Minutemen

Organization, was recently sentenced by a United States District Court in

Kansas City, Missouri, to four years in prison for violation of the National

Firearms Act, to be followed by five years' probation. The terms of the

probation preclude DePugh from maintaining membership in any clandestine

organization.

As a result of this sentence, DePugh recently wrote a letter to the

Minutemen membership advising that he was resigning from his position as

National Coordinator of the Minutemen Organization. DePugh advised the

Minutemen that leadership would come from the Organization's "Executive

Council' whose membership will remain anonymous. DePugh publicly

announced that the "Executive Council" was composed of a group of seven

men who resided in different areas throughout the country. DePugh

related that he would continue to work for the Patriotic Party, a group which

he helped found and which is reportedly the political branch of the Minutemen

• Organization.

You should take steps to insure informant penetration of Minutemen

activity in your territory is adequate to follow any "underground" operations

by that group. It is imperative that sufficient coverage is afforded this

organization to determine whether an 'Executive Council" exists and the

identity of its members if it is in existence.. In view of DePugh's stated

intention of remaining active in the Patriotic Party, it appears highly unlikely

that he will actually divest himself of control of the Minutemen despite the

conditions the court set when sentencing him.

(A) NATIONAL CRIME INFÖRMATION CENTER (NCIC) -- The initial testing

or pilot phase of the NCIC began in January, 1967. Limited operations will be

conducted during the next several months with the 15 local and state law en-

forcement agencies initially participating in the system. Also tied in to the

system as a test terminal is the Denver Field Office.

Copies of the National Crime Information Center Operating

Manual are being forwarded to your office under separate cover in sufficient

number so that you may distribute one copy to each resident agency and retain

two copies in your office. The NCIC Operating Manual is prepared in three

parts: Part I - System Design and Procedures; Part II - Codes; Part III -

Agency Identifiers.

The NCIC Operating Manual is designed for the pilot operation

and changes in the Manual are anticipated as the system progresses with

refinements in techniques and operations. For this reason dissemination

i the Operating Manual is being limited. Dissemination to law enforcement

agencies participating in the pilot NCIC operation is being handled at the Seat

of Government. Requests received by field offices from other law enforce-

ment agencies for copies of the Operating Manual should be forwarded to the

Bureau, attention Uniform Crime Reporting Section.

A list of law enforcement agencies participating in the pilot

phase of the NCIC appears in the Operating Manual. Additional agencies will

be accepted into the system as the system develops and hardware requirements

for an expanded system are met.

During this pilot phase of the NCIC, the data base is being built

up and will include rata submitted by all initial participants as well as data

concerning all Bureau fugitives and stolen property from the National Stolen

Property Index. Further, as the problems are worked out and need for testing

diminishes, the system will begin gradually increasing operating time to a

24-hour-a-day operation. Procedures are being developed to facilitate the

submission of data and inquiries by field offices. You will be furnished complete

instructions concerning this as soon as your participation is feasible.

A TWX teletype machine has been installed in the NCIC Control

Room located in the Unitorm Crime Reporting Section at the Bureau. This

machine has teletype dial #710-822-0006.

The answer back will be:

¿BI NCIC WA DC. Contact concerning the NCIC should be captioned "NCIC."

(B) CRIMINAL INFORMANTS -- You have been repeatedly cautioned as to

the necessity for exercising effective control at all times in the handling of

informants in order to anticipate and avoid possible situations which could be

a source of embarrassment. It was pointed out to you that this possibility

was particularly true of individuals to whom payment is the inducement to

furnish information (SAC Letter 66-39, dated June 21, 1966).

While the demands placed on the Bureau today require that we

maintain the broadest possible live criminal informant coverage, we cannot

let our guard down. Utilize utmost alertness regarding individuals who might

turn against the Bureau. By virtue of your face-to-face, confrontation with

these informants in the field, you have the primary responsibility of ferreting

• sut any tendencies which would make their utilization as informants inadvisable..

In accordance with existing instructions (Manual of Instructions,

Section 108, I, 7, page 8), the Bureau must be promptly advised of any

instances where the continued utilization of the informant would be inadvisable...

You as the SAC must make certain that you are personally

aware of the informants being operated by your office to insure strict compliance

with the foregoing.

Very truly yours,

:

Groups and Military Intelligence Detachments. Pursuant to these orders,

(B) ARREST OF A FOREIGN NATIONAL -- The Department has advised of

a change in procedure for consular notification in instances where nationals of

foreign countries are arrested by the FBI on charges of criminal violations.

• *t conforms to practice under international law and in particular implements

obligations undertaken by the United States pursuant to treaties with respect

to the arrest and detention of foreign nationals. Some of the treaties obligate

the United States to notify the consular officer only upon the demand or

request of the arrested foreign national. On the other hand, some of the

treaties require notifying the consul of the arrest of a foreign national

whether or not the arrested person requests such notification.

1. In every case in which a foreign national is arrested the

arresting officer shall inform the foreign national that his consul will be

: advised of his arrest unless he does not wish such notification to be given.

If the foreign national does not wish to have his consul notified, the arresting

officer shall also inform him that in the event there is a treaty in force

between the United States and his country which requires such notification,

his consul must be notified regardless of his wishes and, if such is the case,

he will be advised of such notification by the United States Attorney.

2. In all arrests by the FBI of foreign nationals, (including those

where the foreign national has stated that he does not wish his consul be

notified) the local office of the FBI shall inform the nearest United States

Attorney of the arrest and of the arrested person's wishes regarding consular

notification.

NW 55069 DocId:32989528 Page 540

---

## Page 541

3. The United States Attorney shall then notify the appropriate

consul except where he has been informed that the foreign national does not

desire such notification to be made. However, if there is a treaty provision

in effect which requires notification of consul, without reference to a demand

or request of the arrested national, the consul shall be notified even if the

arrested person has asked that he not be notified. In such case, the United

States Attorney shall advise the foreign national that his consul has been

notified and inform him that notification was necessary because of the treaty

obligation.

Therefore, it will no longer be necessary to notify the Bureau upon

the arrest of a foreign national, since notification to the appropriate United

States Attorney as outlined above will suffice. Of course, if other circumstances

exist wherein the Bureau should be properly advised in connection with the arrest

of any foreign national, such notification should be made without delay.

(C) CRIMINAL FRAUD INVESTIGATIONS -- Immediate and positive action

is necessary in all conviction-producing cases. In this connection, criminal

fraud cases, particularly Veterans Administration Matters, Fraud Against the

Government, and Federal Housing Administration Matters, continue to offer

excellent opportunities for additional convictions.

This is particularly true in Fraud Against the Government matters

since Federal expenditures for the national defense and various domestic programs

are at an all-time high.

Recent Government efforts to relieve the present tight money market

may result in an increase in Federal Housing Administration and Veterans

Administration insured mortgages and a proportionate increase in false

statements by borrowers to secure such mortgages.

You were informed by SAC Letter 66-40 as to the most recent

legislation affecting veterans. This legislation makes available educational and

loan benefits to veterans discharged after January 31, 1955: All potential and

established sources must be aware of the provisions of this legislation so that

• "ny cases of illegally obtained benefits will be promptly referred to this Bureau.

Positive results can be achieved if every violation is promptly

discovered and referred to the Bureau. This can be accomplished through

effective liaison with appropriate sources for new cases. In this regard, the

Department of Housing and Urban Development has recently changed its referral

procedures whereby alleged violations will now be referred directly to appropriate

Bureau field offices by Regional Inspection Offices of the Inspection Division,

Department of Housing and Urban Development. This will give Bureau fieid

offices covering such Regional Inspection Offices an opportunity to develop and

maintain close liaison with respect to criminal violations in housing matters

in each regional area. This may well result in an increase in cases in this

classification.

All SACs, in line with the observations herein, are instructed to

give personal attention to improving the Bureau's convictions, particularly in

. criminal fraud cases, by intensifying efforts to increase case loads in these

categories. The success of the efforts of each office can be measured by the

number of new cases developed each month, particularly if the number

developed exceeds the average number of such cases developed in the past.

All SACs are, therefore, instructed to examine and evaluate on

a monthly basis the case load in criminal fraud matters and see to it that

definite and continuous progress is made. This is to include a comparison on

a monthly basis of the new origin cases in criminal fraud matters (treating

Fraud Against the Government, Veterans Administration Matters, and

Federal Housing Administration Matters as one group) with the total of such

new matters in this group received during the same month for the preceding

year. If the monthly total of new criminal fraud matters being received is

below the total received last year for the month under review, each SAC

should advise the Bureau as to the specific action being taken, such as

surveys, programs and assignment of personnel, to achieve positive

accomplishments in these important classifications.

All SACs are also instructed to discuss criminal fraud matters

at criminal intelligence conferences with the military as well as during other

public appearances since these afford excellent opportunities to inform these

sources of criminal fraud cases as to our investigative jurisdiction concerning

such matters.

(D) NATIONALITY GROUP COVERAGE -- During the weekend of January

28-29, 1967, explosions occurred at several Yugoslav official establishments

in the United States and Canada, presumably set off by individuals seeking

to embarrass the Tito regime.

This is not the first instance of acts of this nature. In September,

1966, a group of anti-Castro Cubans placed explosives on the premises of

the Cuban Consulate in Ottawa, Canada. The same group previously had

endeavored to fire explosives at the United Nations Building from a point

across the East River. Further, a militant-type Negro group identifying

itself as the Black Liberation Front instituted plans in late 1964 and early

1965 to place explosives near three national monuments in the United States,

the Statue of Liberty in New York City, the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia,

and the Wäshington Monument in Washington, D. C.

Our experience has shown that when a particular group engages

in acts of this nature, this frequently serves as an inducement for other such

dissident factions to endeavor to draw attention to themselves or their causes

through similar actions. Such efforts as these point up the necessity for the

Bureau's having coverage in depth among the various nationality groups in

this country and other dissident factions. Such coverage should be designed

to forewarn us when escapades of this nature are contemplated.

At this time you should conduct a survey of your coverage of

organizations and groups of this nature, especially those which have been

known to engage in acts of violence in the past, to assure that your coverage

is sufficient to discharge the Bureau's responsibilities in this area. When

any such information is received, be certain it reaches the Bureau by the

most expeditious means warranted, including use of teletype dissemination

procedures as outlined in Part II, Section 5, pages 4 and 4a, of the Manual

of Rules and Regulations.

In a continuing effort to effect economy in Bureau operations,

the intelligence branches of the three military agencies, as well as Defense

Intelligence Agency (DIA), were recently contacted regarding their need to

-..-

receive, at a headquarters level, copies of our reports and letterhead

memoranda (LHM) prepared in cases bearing the Internal Security - China

character. As a result of these contacts and in line with the requests of

the above agencies, it has been determined the Bureau will disseminate

to them at a headquarters level using the following guidelines:

1. Where the subject or a person identified as an immediate

relative of the subject is a member of the Armed Forces or is employed at

a key facility, military installation or other location where the military has

a security responsibility, we will disseminate to the interested military

agency and to DIA in every instance.

2. In cases relating to pro-Chinese communist (Chicom)

organizations and publications; cases involving Chicom leaders, Chicom

intelligence activities and Chicom military, naval and air forces we will

disseminate to the three military agencies and to DIA.

3. Dissemination to all the military agencies and DIA will be

made in matters which might have a bearing on overall U. S. military

policies as regards Communist China.

There will be dissemination made at Seat of Government (SOG)

in cases in which it appears that the military agencies have an interest,

although not fitting the guidelines above. The above procedures concern

only dissemination to the military at SOG and do not affect the Bureau's

policy as regards local dissemination.

Effective immediately, furnish Bureau original and four copies

of reports or LHMs in cases on individuals investigated under Internal

Security - China character.

Continue to submit original and eight copies of

reports and LHMs in cases involving Chinese organizations and publications.

•Offices should be alert to submit additional copies when data is worthy of wider

dissemination as indicated by above guidelines.

Manual and Handbook changes being prepared.

(A) CONTRACTS - FISCAL YEAR 1968 -- It will be necessary to solicit

bids for services under contracts which expire June 30, 1967. Before extending

invitations for bids to prospective concerns, review the instructions in Manual

of Rules and Regulations, Part Il, Section I, pertaining to contracts and other

instructions as set forth in SAC Letters 64-10 (C) dated 2/18/64, 66-14 (A)

dated 3/8/66 and 66-48 (A) dated 8/2/66.

Standard Forms 33, 33A, 36 and the Supplemental Provisions

are being revised and the new forms must be used after 3/31/67 in any

solicitation. Any of these forms presently on hand in your office should be

destroyed. A supply of new forms will be forwarded to each office as soon as

they are made available to the Bureau in the near future.

The Department of Labor has indicated that automobile storage

and repair service contracts are covered by the Service Contract Act of 1965,

the provisions of which are a part of the bid specifications. In connection with

this Act, it is necessary that the specifications show any determination as to

minimum wages and fringe benefits which the Wage and Hour and Public

Contracts Divisions of the Department of Labor may have made for any of the

various localities throughout the country where the Bureau may be entering

into an auto storage or auto repair contract. The Bureau 1s in the process of

ascertaining from the Department of Labor if such determinations have been

made for any of our contract localities. If such determinations have been

made, they will be furnished to the offices involved for attachment to the

Invitation for Bids form.

So that the Department of Labor will have time to notify the

Bureau of any determinations, the solicitation for auto storage and repair

services should not be made until March 15, 1967. If you have not received

advice from the Bureau of a separate wage determination by that date, you

should, if the new contract forms have been received by that time, go ahead

and make the solicitation. You will note that the provisions of the Service

Contract Act of 1965 state that where no separate wage determination has

been made a part of the contract, the minimum wage provided by the Fair

Labor Standards Act of 1938 will apply. In this regard, it is the Bureau's

NW 55069 DocId: 32989528 Page 546

---

## Page 547

current understanding that the new contract forms to be received at the Bureau

at a later date will show this hourly rate to be $1.40, effective February 1,

1967.

So that there will be no misunderstanding on the part of prospective

bidders, your letter of solicitation for automobile repair and storage services

should

specifically point out that the Department of Labor has indicated that

automobile storage and repair services come under the Service Contract Act

of 1965 which Act contains provisions as to minimum wages and benefits. If

the bidders have questions as to the provisions of this Act, they should be

advised to contact the nearest office of the Wage and Hour and Public Contracts

Divisions of the Department of Labor since this Act is administered by that

agency.

The Government is placing more and more emphasis on equal

employment opportunity under Government contracts. You should be

discreetly alert in regard to this so that the Bureau does not knowingly enter

into a contract with any concern operating in defiance of the Government's

equal opportunity and wage provisions.

The completed bids with your recommendations should be

mailed to the Bureau as follows:

Albany through Memphis - by May 1, 1967

Miami through Washington Field - by May 15, 1967.

(B) SECURITY INFORMANTS - RACIAL INFORMANTS - CRIMINAL

INFORMANTS - CONTROLS EXERCISED OVER PAYMENTS TO BUREAU

INFORMANTS - You are reminded of the need to closely follow matters

involving payments to informants to insure that the Bureau is getting full

value for money expended and that the record shows complete justification

for all payments made.

Requests for authority to pay informants must be supported

by a summary of the information previously furnished in sufficient detail

to allow an intelligent analysis at the Bureau. The communication should

also show anticipated future coverage informant will provide and an

appraisal of the informant's value. You should also outline the nature of

the expenses incurred by the informant for which payment is being

requested. Payments for services must be made on a strictly c.o.d.

basis, and payments for expenses can only cover expenses actually

incurred by the informant in obtaining information for the Sureau.

The present Bureau system regarding the authorization

of payments to informants affords close supervisory control in the field

and at the Seat of Government. I expect supervisory and investigative

personnel to fully comply with Bureau regulations in these matters.

(A) PERSONNEL MATTERS - OPERATION MUST -- The Civil Service Com-

mission is spearheading a program throughout the Government called Operation

MUST (Maximum Utilization of Skills and Training). The purpose of this letter

is to brief you on the subject so that you will be knowledgeable on it in the event

it arises during any contact with a Civil Service Commission or other Govern-

ment official.

The broad objective of Operation MUST is the maximum utilization

of skills and training to improve the efficiency of the work force through balanced

staffing. A major facet of Operation MUST is job redesign which is the exami-

nation of the organizational structure and each position in the structure to pull

out lower skilled tasks not commensurate with the kind and level of work for

which the jobs were established. The program also embraces careful staffing,

employee development, and careful supervision, particularly of those entering

the labor market for the first time.

The intent of the program is, of course, in keeping with the Bureau's

desire to best and most economically utilize the manpower at our disposal.

However, our centrally managed personnel system is regarded as meeting the

intent of Operation MUST and no need for the Bureau to embark on a new or

different program is indicated.

(B) KIDNAPING MATTERS -- Upon the receipt of any kidnaping complaint it

is essential that you determine at the earliest possible moment whether there

is evidence of a Federal violation. This is necessary in order that we will

not lose valuable investigative time in the early stages of an actual kidnaping

and also to preclude the use of our investigative personnel in cases in which

we should not become involved. While each case must be considered on a

case-to-case basis the following observations and instructions are being

furnished for your guidance in the handling of kidnaping complaints.

24-HOUR PRESUMPTIVE CLAUSE

All Special Agents should be crystal clear in their thinking con-

cerning what the 24-Hour Presumptive Clause does mean and what it does

not mean. This clause does not create a presumption of kidnaping but only

a presumption of interstate transportation after 24 hours in cases in which

it has been established that the victim has been "unlawfully seized, confined,

inveigled, decoyed, kidnaped, abducted, or carried away....."

The fact that the law presumes interstate transportation after 24

bours in cases where there is evidence of an abduction makes it obvious that

. order to make a sound determination we must not remain idle during this

important period. We have an obligation to maintain close liaison and, if

indicated, to conduct active investigation during this time to determine if

a Federal violation has been committed. There will be instances, of course,

where there is a clear-cut abduction and it is desirable to immediately enter

the case without waiting for the lapse of 24 hours.

INITIAL ACTION

It is essential that the Bureau be furnished pertinent facts as soon

as available on any new case together with a clear statement as to action

taken and contemplated. Any indication that a domestic situation is involved

or that the case is largely of a police character even though constituting a

technical violation of the Kidnaping Statute should be fully spelled out. While

we do not want to encroach upon local jurisdiction nor do we want to become

involved in the numerous "missing person" cases reported each year, we do

have a clear duty to take action if there is evidence of an abduction.

It is

emphasized that the field offices are in the best position to obtain all avail-

able facts and should take the initiative in recommending a positive plan of

action in any kidnaping case.

DISCUSSIONS WITH U. S. ATTORNEY

When there is a legal question involved as to whether the facts

constitute a Federal violation, or where prosecution would probably be

declined because of established Departmental policy the facts should be

discussed with the U. S. Attorney promptly in order that the time of our

personnel will not be expended on cases which have no prosecutive potential.

Care should be taken, however, to insure that cases are not presented

to the U. S. Attorney prematurely, since the development of sufficient facts

to enable the U. S. Attorney to render his prosecutive opinion is our

responsibility.

HOAX CASES

The Bureau has noted an increasing number of hoax cases in

which persons falsely claim that they have been kidnaped. For this reason,

it is desirable in many cases to obtain a signed statement from the victim.

Where there is any indication that the complaint may constitute a hoax, the

individual should be fully advised of the provisions of Section 1002, Title

CAPTION ON COMMUNICATIONS TO BUREAU

There is a compelling need for selecting the proper caption in

communications directed to the Bureau. Kidnaping matters should not be

labeled "missing person" and, on the other hand, if the case is strictly

a missing person matter, the "missing person" caption only should be used.

This is necessary to insure proper and immediate routing upon receipt at

the Bureau.

(D) VISITORS TO EXPO-67 AND CANADIAN CENTENNIAL YEAR -- In

response to invitations issued by the Canadian Government, it is expected

that many heads of state and other foreign dignitaries will visit Montreal

and other areas in Canada during 1967. Announcement has already been

made concerning the proposed visits of the Presidents of Yugoslavia, Tunisia,

Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union; and several members of the British

Royal Family are also expected.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), which is charged

• with security arrangements for the visiting dignitaries, has requested FBI

cooperation in furnishing any information received indicating the possibility

of physical attacks, picketing, demonstrations, or other activities with

respect to any visitor. In addition, some of these officials may visit the

United States, and similar information will be desired by the Department

of State.

Each office is instructed to be particularly alert to any intelligence

which may be received from informants or other sources with regard to these

visitors. If the information received relates to a visit which is scheduled to

commence within ten days, it should be forwarded by teletype or telephone,

dependent on its urgency. Such material and any information relating to visits

more than ten days in the future should be forwarded in letterhead memorandum

form, prepared for dissemination, by airtel. Six copies of each LHM should

be furnished.

(E) INVESTIGATION OF STUDENT GROUPS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES --

In view of the current controversy resulting from the disclosure of Central

President Johnson has expressed great concern over the relationship between

the United States Government agencies and educational organizations. He

has appointed a commission to study this matter and "to formulate a policy

which will provide necessary guidance for Government agencies in their

relationship to the international activities of American educational organi-

zations."

It is possible that this current controversy could focus attention

on the Bureau's investigations uf student groups on college campuses. It

is also possible that student groups such as the Students for a Democratic

Society and the W: E. B. DuBois Clubs of America could use this

controversy as a vehicle to create some incident to embarrass the Bureau

by claiming that we are infringing on academic'freedom by investigating

such groups. You should, therefore, bear in mind that in our continuing

investigations to keep abreast of subversive influence in campus groups,

in discharging our responsibilities in the internal security field, such

investigations should be conducted in a most discreet and circumspect

manner. Good judgment and common sense must prevail so that the

Bureau is not compromised or placed in an embarrassing position.

You are reminded that under our existing policy Bureau authority

must be obtained before instituting an investigation of a faculty member

and an organization connected with an institution of learning, and before

interviewing any student, faculty member or employee of an institution

of learning (other than reliable and established sources) during an in-

vestigation of a subject connected with such an institution.

Bureau authority is also necessary before an individual con-

nected with an institution of learning can be contacted for the purpose of

developing him as an informant or source. In all instances, contacts

with security informants and sources in campus groups and interviews

of security subjects connected with institutions of learning should be

made away from the campus.

The above should be brought to the attention of all Agent

personnel of your office handling these matters.

(F) FOREIGN POLICY ASSOCIATION - "GREAT DECISIONS" PROGRAM -

INFORMATION CONCERNING (INTERNAL SECURITY) -- The Foreign

Policy Association, 345 East 46th Street, New York City, was founded in

1918 to develop, through education, an informed and articulate public

opinion on major issues of foreign policy. "Great Decisions" is one of

the programs through which the Association carries out its aims and

objectives. The "Great Decisions" program is carried on through the

media of radio and television and through local discussion groups set up.

by various individuals, schools and community organizations.

In 1942 and 1950 the Bureau conducted limited investigations

concerning the Foreign Policy Association but no subversive information

on the part of the Association was developed. Recently, the Bureau

received information that "The Worker," an east coast communist news-

paper, had exhibited an interest in the "Great Decisions" program and

plans to do a series of articles on the program. A staff writer of "The

Worker" was seeking information concerning the location of the local •

discussion groups throughout the United States so he can encourage his

• readers to participate in such groups. It would appear from this that the

Communist Party, through "The Worker"' and its representatives, may

be embarking on a campaign to infiltrate local discussion groups operating

under the "Great Decisions" program.

The Bureau's information concerning the activity of "The

Worker'' and its representatives has come from a source highly placed

inside the Foreign Policy Association and the Association is desirous of

avoiding any communist influence in it or its "Great Decisions" program.

In view of this, and in carrying out our responsibilities in the internal

security field, the field should be alert to any efforts of the communists

to infiltrate the Foreign Policy Association or the local discussion groups

under the "Great Decisions" program. However, the field should avoid

taking any action which would create the impression that we are investi-

gating the Association or the "Great Decisions" program. Any information

received concerning this matter should be immediately brought to the

Bureau's attention; however, no investigation should be conducted with-

out specific Bureau authority. In the event further investigation is deemed

warranted, such should be handled in accordance with instructions dealing

with communist infiltration investigations as set forth in Section 87E of

the Manual of Instructions.

(G) SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS -- In reviewing

organizational reports in internal security matters, the Bureau has noted

a tendency on the part of some field offices to fail to open for immediate

investigation some individual cases in which allegations of current

membership or activity in subversive organizations exist.

It is a fundamental FBI responsibility to open immediately

cases on individuals concerning whom information is received indicating

current membership and activity in a basic revolutionary organization

or active participation or leadership in front groups. Indications to this

effect developed in the course of investigation of subversive organizations

as such must be promptly resolved by investigation so that the questions

of potential dangerousness and Security Index status can be resolved as

soon as possible.

This matter will be followed closely at the Bureau to assure

that cases in this category are promptly opened and investigated.

DIRECTOR TO CUBAN REFUGEES -- Arrangements have been made for

each adult Cuban refugee being processed through the Cuban Refugee

Center at Miami, Florida.

This message informs the refugee of the FBI's responsibilities

in the Cuban field and instructs the refugee as to how he can get in touch

with the FBI to report subversive information. Since many refugees are

being relocated from the Miami area to all parts of the U. S., any office

might be contacted.

Promptly initiate investigations, where warranted, on basis of

any such information received. In order that Bureau may determine the

effectiveness of the distribution, note administratively in the initial com-

munication to Bureau the fact that the aforementioned message prompted

the refugee to report the information.

(A) MULTIPLE FINGERPRINTING - IDENTIFICATION MATTER -- SAC

Letter 61-16 dated March 28, 1961, pointed out the substantial duplication

in submissions of arrest and applicant prints by local agencies and the

necessity for all Agents in their daily contacts with such agencies to detect

instances of multiple submissions and emphasize the need for eliminating

this expensive practice. Specific suggestions were furnished each office

concerning individual records in the months that followed and much

improvement resulted after agencies involved were contacted.

The work of the Identification Division has increased

tremendously since 1961; fingerprint receipts alone are up 31. 46 per

cent. Bureau desires that renewed emphasis be placed on the undesirability

of multiple fingerprint submissions. Emphasize this at Police Schools, law

enforcement conferences and in daily contacts with law enforcement and

governmental agencies in your territory.

We know that some jurisdictions require fingerprinting

incidental to an arrest or incarceration even though prints have been taken

by another agency for the same offense. Our program to curtail duplicate

fingerprint submissions is not intended to conflict with such requirements.

We are merely asking that law enforcement agencies in the same area

work together to insure that only one set of fingerprints for each arrest or

incarceration is forwarded for search by our Identification Division.

Encourage the initial fingerprinting agency to use the "send copy to"

block on the reverse side of the fingerprint card to indicate interested

agencies that should receive a copy of our reply thus eliminating fingerprint

submissions by those agencies. Another procedure sometimes followed is

to have the first agency submitting prints request multiple copies of our

reply for dissemination locally when received.

(C) AUTOMOBILES - 1961 AND 1962 PLYMOUTHS - Several field offices

have advised they have experienced trouble with brake fade and reduced

stopping power in 1961 and 1962 Plymouths which have been driven in excess

of 50, 000 miles. These vehicles are equipped with power brakes utilizing

the air vacuum system to provide power assist.

A discussion of this matter with the Chrysler Corporation

indicates the problem is usually due to deterioration of the seal in the check

valve assembly of the vacuum booster or by collapse of the vacuum line

hose. The situation is easily corrected by replacement of these parts as

required. The above should be borne in mind when performing the monthly

automotive inspection of 1961 and 1962 Plymouth vehicles assigned your

office.

(D) COMMUNIST PARTY, USA - STRATEGY IN INDUSTRY - Prior to 1961,

Communist Party, USA, Strategy in Industry was a subfile of the Party file

and, as such, activities in this field were reported in the Communist Party,

USA, quarterly report. By letter dated October 10, 1960, you were instructed

to open and assign a separate case on the subject of Strategy in Industry, and

submit quarterly reports with the same due dates as the reports in the

Communist Party, USA, case. This instruction is being rescinded and all

activities concerning Communist Party, USA, Strategy in Industry will now

be reported in the Communist Party, USA, quarterly report under a section

captioned "Strategy in Industry." If your division has no activities to report

concerning this matter, you should set this out in the cover pages of the

Communist Party, USA, quarterly report or letter submitted in lieu of such

report.

This administrative change in our reporting should in no way

be construed by you to mean that less emphasis is to be placed on the

investigation of the strategy, tactics and infiltration activities by the

Communist Party, USA, directed against the industrial and labor field with

particular emphasis on basic and vital industries. You should continue an

enthusiastic program of vigilance and vigorously investigate this important

Prime Minister Fidel Castro will visit Canada during 1967. The visit is

scheduled to coincide with Cuban National Da y at Expo 67, an international

exhibition to be held in Montreal, Canada. The tentative itinerary is as

. follows: July 24 - Ottawa; July 25 - Ottawa and Montreal; and July 26 - Expo

RCMP has requested we furnish any data which could be of

assistance in planning security arrangements. Of particular interest is any

information concerning plans to cause bodily harm, to demonstrate, or

embarrass the individual concerned as well as information concerning the

travel of any anti-Castro suspects to Canada. Since anti-Castro Cuban exiles

in this country in the past have travelled to Canada to attack Cuban

establishments there, we can expect that they will plan various militant:

anti-Castro activities to be carried out in connection with this visit.

Each office alert logical sources and informants and advise the

Bureau öf any pertinent information received by the most expeditious means

warranted so it can promptly be referred to the RCMP. Submit data under

caption of "Visit of Cuban President Osvaldo Dorticos or Prime Minister

Fidel Castro to Canada in July, 1967, Internal Security - Cuba."

It is noted that when President Dorticos came to the U. S. in

1962 to attend a United Nations session he was accompanied by an individual

who was subsequently arrested in this country for conspiracy to commit

sabotage in New York City. We can expect that such individuals will accompany

Dorticos or Castro on the proposed visit. In addition, the visit and Expo 67

afford the Cuban Intelligence Service an excellent opportunity to send personnel

to Canada where they could direct intelligence activities against the U. S.;

meet with intelligence agents from the U. S.; or attempt to infiltrate agents

into this country. Keep Bureau currently advised of any pertinent information

received along these lines under an appropriate caption.

to spread the typing load of the administrative report those pages

dealing with the accounting work be sent in later than those pages

dealing with the regular administrative report. This suggestion has

been given careful consideration and it has been approved. Beginning

with the administrative report to be submitted for the month of March,

the report will be submitted in two parts. The first part will consist

of an original and one copy of forms FD-29 and FD-29a. These are

the pages that relate to all investigative work and are to be mailed to

the Bureau by the third working day following the end of the month for

which prepared. These pages should be numbered consecutively in the

place provided at the upper right beginning with number two (2) for the

first FD-29a. The second part, dealing with the accounting matters,

will consist of an original and two copies of forms FD -29g (if used),

FD-29h and an original and one copy of FD-291, Which is to be mailed

to the Bureau by the seventh working day following the end of the month

for which prepared. These pages should be numbered consecutively

from one (1) upward in the space provided at the upper right. In

making this change, however, it will be necessary to include on the

last page of the first submission (form FD-29a) a final one-line entry

"Number of Accounting Matters Pending"' and the total should be

shown in column 5(g).

It is felt that this change will spread the typing work

out over a longer period of time and enable the Field to better meet

the deadlines in connection with the administrative report.

Analysis of the report submitted for the month of February indicates

that in total the accounting pages comprised over 46% of the total

pages of all reports. This would appear to indicate that the change

should help relieve typing congestion substantially in most offices

in connection with the preparation of the administrative report.

Appropriate manual changes are being prepared for prompt

distribution to the Field.

remove ignition keys from their automobiles and lock these

automobiles when leaving them on the street.

All employees should be reminded of the necessity

(G) SPECIAL AGENTS - OFFICE OF PREFERENCE TRANSFERS

AND AVAILABILITY FOR SUCH TRANSFERS -- Instances have

continued to arise in which agents list an office of preference to

which they are no longer desirous of being assigned and fail to

advise the Bureau until after transfer orders are issued. This

situation has been called to your attention on a number of occasions

in the past and most recently in SAC Letter 66-13(A). You should

again remind all agents that it is imperative for office of preference

designations to be maintained current at all times. Any condition

temporary or otherwise which would have an effect on an agent's

availability for such transfer must be brought to the attention of the

Bureau. If an agent changes his office of preference designation

because of a temporary problem he can thereafter restate his offices

of preference when that problem has been resolved.

An agent's standing on the office of preference list is

not based on the date on which he lists a particular office of preference

but rather on his seniority as an agent. As you have been previously

advised, no requests for cancellation of transfers based upon the office

of preference program will be approved. Insure that all agents thoroughly

understand what is expected of them in discharging their personal

responsibility for keeping their office of preference listings current

and accurate.

(J) REPORT WRITING - COMMUNIST PARTY, USA, AND OTHER

ORGANIZATIONAL REPORTS -- A review of a number of organi-

that in many instances there has been a failure to comply with

certain instructions contained in Sections 87C and 87E of the Manual

of Instructions with regard to information that should appear in

the cover pages to the report.

Instructions are contained in the above manual references

calling for statements to be included in cover pages of Communist

Party quarterly reports and certain other organizational reports

to the effect that all persons named therein as members of the

organization and who reside within the area covered by the reporting

office are listed in the Security Index or are informants or sources

with the exception of those listed. In subversive front organization

reports and certain other miscellaneous organizations this rule

applies only to those individuals identified as officers, leaders,

and/or active substantial participants in the affairs thereot.

The basic purpose of the above rule was to eliminate

unnecessary indexing at the Bureau and in the future, you should

insure that the above-cited manual provisions are carefully followed

in the submission of organizational reports as well as in the sub-

mission of the annual Communist Party organizational survey letters.

FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY - APPLICANT INVESTIGATIONS -

POST GRADUATE CONTACTS - In spite of clear-cut instructions

contained in the letters which institute National Academy applicant

investigations, there have been several trends in the handling of

these investigations which should be corrected. Physical examination

forms must be submitted with the closing communication from the

Office of Origin. These forms must be complete in every respect

before consideration is given to an applicant. The FD-300 form

which accompanies the Standard Form 88 contains specific instructions

as to which portions of Standard Form 88 must be completed. In

each instance, when a man is 35 years or older, he must have an

electrocardiogram (EKG) examination and the results recorded in

the appropriate block on the Standard Form 88. All candidates must

have a serology examination. All candidates must have an X-ray

examination where facilities are available. Should an inquiry have

to be made concerning any portion of the physical examination, this

could well mean that a particular candidate would not be invited to

a given session.

The entire adult life of a National Academy applicant is

investigated.

Neighbors are contacted at every locale where the

applicant resided during his adult years. Verification of his law

enforcement employment requires contact with his superiors;

associates, and subordinates. It is not sufficient to contact the

head of the agency alone.

Post graduate contacts with National Academy graduates

are an important responsibility of each field office. Information

concerning promotions, demotions, derogatory information, changes

of address, position, health, or employment should be reported to the

Bureau immediately by means dictated by the circumstances.

It is not sufficient to routinely submit these items to be

included in the FBI National Academy Associates Newsletter when a

letter of congratulations, encouragement, or condolence may be in

order. Good judgment should be used in handling these items so there

will be no delays which would preclude recognition by the Bureau.

(B) VOUCHERS - PUBLIC LAW 89-516 APPROVED JULY 21, 1966 -

BUREAU OF THE BUDGET CIRCULAR NUMBER A-56. REVISED

OCTOBER 12, 1966 - AMENDMENTS TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES ACT OF 1946 -- A recent Decision of the Comptroller

General states that where the miscellaneous expense allowance

provided in Section 3.2a(1) of Circular A-56, revised October 12,

1966, does not exceed $100 for employee without immediate family

or $200 for employee with immediate family, the claim should be

paid without the necessity of receipts or itemized statements. The

Decision further states that these allowances are not predicated on

the amount of expenses incurred. Accordingly, a transferred employee

may claim the $100 or $200 (whichever is applicable) without

furnishing an itemized statement.

Any employee previously submitting a claim for

miscellaneous expenses who did not receive the full $100 or $200 may

submit a supplemental voucher for the difference. There is no change

in the regulations that where the amount of miscellaneous expenses

claimed exceeds either the $100 or $200 amounts (whichever is

applicable) receipts are necessary for all such expenses claimed.

All employees in your office should be advised of the above.

Necessary Manual changes will be forthcoming.

(C) EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION - SAFETY POLICY FOR THE

FEDERAL SERVICE (MISSION SAFETY-70) -- You were previously

advised in 1965 and 1966 that the President has set a goal to reduce

work injuries and costs 30% by 1970 under "Mission Safety-70" program.

Statistics indicate recent improvement concerning reduction

of on-the-job accidents resulting in injury to our employees. Neverthe-

less, you should intensify efforts to further reduce accidents which are

costly and cause loss of manpower. Employees on a continuing basis

should be instructed to remain alert to hazards which might cause injuries

and you should instill a safety-conscious attitude among your employees.

You are instructed to submit a report coverning your specific safety

accomplishments during the previous year to reach the Bureau no later

than March 1, 1968, and report any specific actions taken to prevent accidents.

(D) VOUCHER MATTER - AMENDMENTS TO STANDARDIZED

GOVERNMENT TRAVEL REGULATIONS - Enclosed is a copy of

the Bureau of the Budget Circular Number A-7 dated April 7, 1967.

Amendments have been made in the regulations relating to the

allowance for use of taxicabs in certain instances and in the percentage

rate to be used in determining the appropriate amount that may be

claimed for tips. In addition, a new provision has been made for the

use of taxicabs between the employee's home and the office on the day

he departs on, or returns from, an official trip requiring at least

one night's lodging. In addition, a change has been made to eliminate

the reference to daylight saving time in the computation of per diem.

All changes prescribed by this circular are effective April 30, 1967.

Additional copies of the circular are being forwarded to your office

under separate cover.

To implement the change relating to the use of taxicabs

for travel between employee's home or office and a common carrier

terminal, the Bureau has established a policy whereby all such

claims for reimbursement in excess of $7, including tip, must be

justified to show that a more economical mode of travel could not

have been used.

(E) SELECTIVE SERVICE ACT OF 1948 - CONSCIENTIOUS

OBJECTORS - Requests for investigations of individuals seeking

conscientious objector deferments are on the increase. The percentage

of college students among them is also on the increase.

A number of colleges and universities have recently adopted

policies restricting disclosure of information regarding students,

without written consent of the student.

Each investigation must be as complete as possible so that

a decision can be reached as to whether the registrant is claiming

conscientious objector status in good faith. I do not, however, desire

that the subjects of these investigations be sought out and requested to

give permission for review of records.

Identities of individuals who are associated with educational

institutions, which have restrictions on availability of student records;

should be obtained during the course of interviews with references.

neighbors, associates, etc., where possible. A representative group

of these individuals should be interviewed if it is known they would

have information regarding the registrant. The restrictive policies

of educational institutions must be clearly set out in investigative

reports.

In those unusual instances where it is desirable to interview

a registrant applying for conscientious objector deferment. there will

be no change in existing instructions that he may not be interviewed

without first obtaining authority from the United States Attorney.

All investigative employees are again reminded of the

necessity of verifying conscientious objector registrant's birth date.

High school records will suffice for verification.

The registrant's current employment and whether such

employment involves defense contracts must be determined. The

extent of registrant's knowledge of defense production must also be

determined and set out in details of report. Also, when references

cannot be located for any particular reason, such

should be set forth

completely in details in order that the Department will know the reason

interview was not conducted.

(F) NATIONAL CRIME INFORMATION CENTER (NCIC) - STOLEN

MOTOR VEHICLES -- Arrangements are now being made to include

records of the National Automobile Theft Bureau (NATB) in NCIC.

It is anticipated that this will be completed in the near future. This

will supplement stolen vehicle data already in file and being kept

current by operating NCIC terminals. To take full advantage of

NCIC in connection with Bureau cases, the following is to become

effective immediately.

Where automobiles are involved in Bureau cases such

as Crime on Government Reservation, Bank Robbery, Kidnaping,

or similar cases, and the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN):

license plate number and descriptive data of the automobile are

known,

these should be included in NCIC immediately. In addition,

casesof special interest involving theft of automobiles should also

be included in NCIC if they meet the criteria as set forth in the

NCIC Operating Manual. : These entries should be made through the

nearest NCIC terminal available or through direct communication

with NCIC at the Bureau.;

In connection with your liaison programs in the

Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor Vehicle classification,

automobiles located at impound lots, tow-in garages, salvage

yards, auto auctions, etc., should be first checked through

NCIC to determine if stolen. Frequent contact should be made

with local law enforcement agencies which have access to NCIC

terminals, to insure impounded vehicles are checked directly

on a regular basis through NCIC.

Field Offices which do not have local law enforcement

agencies that have a terminal with NCIC should submit record

checks by teletype direct to NCIC, TWX #710-822-0006 or by

other communications marked to the attention NCIC.

(G) STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY - SUBVERSIVE

ORGANIZATION CHARACTERIZATION -- Set forth below is a

characterization of Students for a Democratic Society which should

be utilized in the future when it is necessary to characterize this

organization in investigative reports and other types of communications.

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

The Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), as it is

known today, came into being at a founding convention held at Port

Huron, Michigan, in June. 1962. The SDS is an association of young

people on the left and has a current program of protesting the draft,

promoting a campaign for youth to develop a conscientious objector

status, denouncing United States intervention in the war in Vietnam

and to "radically transform" the university community, and provide

for its complete control by students. Gus Hall, General Secretary,

Communist. Party, USA, when interviewed by a representative of

United Press International in San Francisco. California, on May 14:

1965, described the SDS as a part of the "responsible left" which the

Party has "going for us." At the. June, 1965, SDS National Convention.

an anticommunist proviso was removed from the SDS constitution.

In the October 7, 1966, issue of "New Left Notes," the official

publication of SDS, an SDS spokesman stated that there are some

communists in SDS and they are welcome. The national headquarters

of this organization as of April 18. 1967, was located in Room 206,

1608 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois.

(B) DESERTER MATTERS - DISCONTINUE AIRTEL -- After Bureau

assistance to locate a deserter has been requested and the service

learns that the deserter has surrendered, been apprehended, located, or

his deserter status otherwise cleared without Bureau participation, a

discontinue letter is immediately sent to Bureau Headquarters. Based

upon this letter, the Bureau prepared a discontinue airtel which was

forwarded to the office of origin. Henceforth, instead of a discontinue

airtel, an extra copy of the discontinue letter from the interested branch

of the military service will be forwarded from the Bureau to the office

of origin by routing slip. Upon receipt of this discontinue letter prepared

by the service, office of origin will immediately advise all auxiliary

offices to discontinue investigation to locate the deserter.

Each such discontinue letter or form used by the services

is self-explanatory. The Army and the Air Force use Defense Depart-

ment Form 616 which is entitled "REPORT OF RETURN OF." The

Navy uses a form letter FD-103 and the Marine Corps' letter contains

no code designation, but is entitled "DESERTER LOCATED." Each of

these forms will contain the deserter's name and serial number and

the date of his return to military control. In some instances, where

known, additional information is furnished indicating whether he

surrendered, was apprehended, or his deserter status cleared by

other means.

(C) INVESTIGATION OF STUDENT GROUPS ON COLLEGE

CAMPUSES -- Bureau teletype to all Special Agents in Charge dated

March 30, 1967, captioned "Contacts with Educational Institutions"

set forth instructions that all outstanding authorizations to contact

students, graduate students, professors, informants, established sources

and other sources at educational institutions in security matters were

rescinded.

The purpose of these instructions is to guard Bureau's

interests in a most sensitive area and to prevent possible carelessness

on the part of individuals which could place us in

a most embarrassing

light. It is realized that these instructions impose problems for the

field; however, they in no way relieve the field of its investigative

responsibility of keeping abreast of the activities of those groups which

have the potential for infiltration by the Communist Party or other

subversive organizations or which are actually being controlled, dom-

inated or influenced by such organizations.

It is incumbent on your office to devise ways and means

of obtaining the desired information without placing the Bureau in a

position where we can be criticized for infringing on the rights and

freedom of the academic community. Such information can be secured

from public source material and through the development of noncampus

informants and sources. Of course, there is no prohibition against

accepting information voluntarily furnished by individuals connected

with institutions of learning. This information should be accepted

without comment.

Each office must submit a letter to reach the Bureau no

later than June 1, 1967, setting forth the identity of campus groups

which are under investigation, the identities of the sources and

informants now affording coverage to each group and the plans and

programs of the office to develop the necessary coverage. Thereafter,

on a quarterly basis, a letter is to be submitted setting forth the

achievements and progress being made in implementing the programs

set up.

(A) ARREST AND ARRAIGNMENT -- Occasionally there has been some

difficulty in proving probable cause for arrest because of the refusal of the

Unitéd States Commissioner to accept hearsay evidence at the pre-

liminary hearing. The position of the Department of Justice is that

hearsay evidence is admissible for such purposes, and the Department

has reaffirmed this position in its memorandum #511, dated April 10,

1967, to all United States Attorneys, on the subject "Admissibility

of hearsay evidence at preliminary hearings." Should any United

States Commissioner refuse to accept hearsay evicence at the pre-

NOMINATIONS FOR 1966 -- Attached are two copies of a letter the

Attorney General has sent to the Governors of all the states and

territories and the President of the Board of Commissioners, District

of Columbia. It will be noted that August 30, 1967, has been established

as the deadline date for the receipt of nominations of candidates for the

1966 awards. The Attorney General has again emphasized the necessity

that nominations be accompanied by complete documentation concern-

ing the actions of the nominees for consideration.

You should bring this program to the attention of appropriate

officials when contacting them on other matters. They should be

reminded that all nominations must be made through the Governor of

the individual state. It has been noted in the past that the submission

of candidates for the Service Award has not been in proportion to the

many young people who are performing acts which would qualify them

for consideration as a recipient of this award.

• Any candidates of whom you become aware should be brought

to the attention of appropriate authorities for consideration and possible

submission as nominees for these awards.

(C) SPECIAL AGENTS - OFFICE OF PREFERENCE TRANSFER --

In order to clear up any misunderstandings which may exist, I wish

to reiterate policy concerning transfers to offices of preference

listed by Agents. Three offices may be listed, in any order desired.

It will be considered that the first one on the list is the one most

desired as an office of assignment, with the others in relative priority

after that, according to their listed position. Agents will be con-

sidered in connection with suitable vacancies in offices listed. If an

Agent is not in an office of preference, he will be considered for all

of them. If he is in his third or second listed office of preference,

he will be considered for his second or first listed office, without

regard to the time he may have been in his present assignment, so

long as offices of higher priority are listed by him.

Formerly, the rule was that when an Agent received a transfer

to an office listed by him as his first preference, he would not then be

considered for another office of preference transfer for three years.

This rule is no longer in effect.

If an Agent receives assignment to an office listed by him

as third or second, and for personal reasons would not wish to be

considered for another office of preference transfer in the near future,

he should then remove those offices listed in a higher order of

preference. If any are still listed, he will be considered for transfer

as vacancies occur in those offices. It is again emphasized that the

position of an Agent on an office of preference list is determined by

his date of entry on duty, not the date he designates a particular office.

It is the personal responsibility of the Agent concerned to be

sure that at all times his office of preference listings reflect his current

desires.

It is also emphasized that assignment to a first office of

preference does not mean an Agent will not be considered for transfer

if his services are required in another location. At all times the needs

of the service must be paramount, and assignment of Agents will be

made accordingly.

Insure that this is brought to attention of all Agent personnel

of, your Division. Appropriate manual changes will be issued.

(D) CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS -- The current fiscal year is rapidly

drawing to a close, and I am concerned we may not adequately depict

the effectiveness of our investigative activity.

While I am aware of the factors impeding prosecution of

certain violators, I can see no justification for an office to be unable

to show an improvement in its criminal investigative activities over

an extended period of time.

It is imperative each Special Agent in Charge make a con-

certed all-out effort to improve our accomplishments during the balance

of the fiscal year. It will be your personal responsibility to see that

all matters with prosecutive potential are promptly and adequately

investigated, thereafter followed by timely, well-organized presentations

to United States Attorneys. Any delays in prosecution should be fol-

lowed closely with the United States Attorney and any aggravated

situations should be brought to the attention of the Bureau so the matter

can be referred to the Department. Reports setting forth results of

prosecution, including sentences received, should be immediately

submitted to the Bureau. No delays or shortcomings will be tolerated.

The prosecutive problems now confronting us will be even

more pronounced during the forthcoming fiscal year. It will, there-

fore, be necessary for you at this time to critically analyze your

liaison assignments and investigative policies to insure you have the

programs and procedures operating which will produce the desired

results.

for dissemination to Secret Service under the terms of the "Agreement

Between The Federal Bureau of Investigation and The Secret Service

Concerning Presidential Protection. "

Instances have also been noted wherein individuals have

been incorrectly categorized as to the reason or reasons for referral

to Secret Service. You should reiterate to all personnel at this time

the necessity for the utlization of the above form in effecting dis-

semination to Secret Service under the terms of the above Agreement.

You should also emphasize the necessity for insuring that the individuals

referred are properly categorized as falling within one or more of the

six specified categories listed in Appendix B to the above-mentioned

Agreement.

We are obligated to promptly furnish Secret Service all

information of interest to it in connection with its responsibilities

for Presidential protection and our responsibilities in this field should

the Winnipeg area is reportedly made up of many nationality groups

many of which are violently anti- or pro-Castro. According to the

Winnipeg Police Department, these groups could be easily provoked

into an incident. In addition, thousands of visitors including many

from other Western Hemispheric countries are expected.

The RCMP and the Winnipeg Police Department have re-

quested FBI cooperation in furnishing them with any information we

may develop which would assist them in security arrangements and

in maintaining law and order during the Games.

The Winnipeg Police Department has also requested we

furnish it with information concerning identities of gamblers, hoodlums

and other criminals who contemplate attending these Games as well

as any other pertinent criminal intelligence we may develop which

would assist it.

Anti-Castro Cuban exiles in this country in the past have

traveled to Canada to attack Cuban establishments there. It can be

expected they will plan various militant anti-Castro activities during

the Games. If Castro or Cuban President Osvaldo Dorticos attends

the Games, such planned activities may include plots to cause bodily

harm, to demonstrate against or to embarrass either of these individuals.

Each office and Legal Attache should insure logical security

and criminal sources, including anti-Castro, pro-Castro, and other

Latin-American sources, are alerted concerning this matter.

Pertinent information of a security nature should be furnished

the Bureau by most expeditious means warranted, including use of

teletype dissemination procedures as outlined in Part II, Section 5,

pages 4 and 4a, of the Manual of Rules and Regulations. The character

"Internal Security - Latin America" should be used.

Criminal intelligence data should be furnished the Bureau in

letterhead memorandum which includes significant background infor-

mation, a physical description and arrest record concerning persons

who contemplate visiting Winnipeg during the Games. With respect to

criminal-type intelligence, the caption "Pan-American Games -

Criminal Intelligence Matter" should be utilized.

It is my privilege to invite you to participate in the awards

These medals are awarded annually, under an Act of Con-

gress, to boys and girls under the age of 19 who have performed

outstanding acts of courage or service.

Nominations are made by the Governors of the states, ter-

ritories and possessions of the United States. You may submit

' any number of nominations. From these nominations, winners

are selected by the Young American Medals Committee of the

Department of Justice for final approval by the Attorney General.

I am enclosing two copies of the rules and regulations gov-

erning the awards. Also enclosed for your information is the

announcement of the committee's selections for 1965.

Let me emphasize the need for documentation. The com-

mittee, chaired by Mr. J. Edgar Hoover, has received a number

of nominations accompanied only by the sketchiest description of

the nominees' acts and little, if any, supporting material. It is

impossible for the committee to give even the most deserving

youngsters proper consideration on the basis of so slight a record.

Nominations will be received until August 30, 1967. They

should be sent to the Young American Medals Committee, Room

5116, Department of Justice, Washington, D. C., 20530.

(A) CONTACTS WITH EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS -- Bureau teletype to

all Special Agents in Charge dated March 30, 1967, and SAC Letter 67-20 (A)

dated April 7, 1967, both captioned as above advised that all prior authority

to contact any student, graduate student or professor including established

sources, informants and other sources in connection with security matters

was rescinded and pointed out that if any such contact was necessary with

any of these individuals prior Bureau authority must be obtained with full

justification. The purpose of these instructions was to avoid any possibility

of the FBI being accused of interference with academic freedom.

Effective immediately, Bureau authority will not be required

to contact individuals at educational institutions in the following instances:

1. Established sources functioning in an administrative

capacity such as a Registrar, Director of Admissions, Dean of Men, Dean

of Women and Security Officer, and their subordinates. Contacts may be

made on the campus.

2. Established sources and informants who are not reporting

on any campus activities or any matter pertaining to the educational

institution. These contacts must be made away from the campus.

3. Any individual who can furnish information in civil cases

such as Ascertaining Financial Ability, Court of Claims, Admiralty Matters,

False Claims-Civil, Federal Tort Claims Act and Miscellaneous-Civil

Suits, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

It is pointed out that Bureau authority is still necessary to

contact any student, graduate student or professor in security matters re-

garding his personal knowledge of any individual, group or activity related

to the educational institution as opposed to contacts with administrative

officials who maintain records as mentioned above.

You are cautioned that good judgment must prevail and, if

there is any information available which would indicate that any contact

(A) STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY -- Recently, a

west coast office reported that a field secretary of the Students

for a Democratic Society, upon completion of an interview in a

Conscientious Objector case, attempted to follow the interviewing

Agent. Upon realizing this, the Agent confronted this individual

at which time he stated that Students for a Democratic Society

members had received instructions from the Students for a

Democratic Society National Office in Chicago that whenever

they were interviewed by the FBI they should obtain the name of

the interviewing Agent, his description and the complete description

and license number of the automobile used by the Agent.

Our Chicago Office has furnished information that

recently the Chicago Police Department had occasion to search an

automobile which was owned by an individual who was directly

involved in distributing Students for a Democratic Society leaflets

in Chicago. Upon searching this automobile, it was ascertained

that it was wired for sound which included a toggle switch and a

tape recorder.

In view of these two situations, you should alert all

Special Agent personnel of the current tactics utilized by the Students

for a Democratic Society to possibly place the Bureau in an

embarrassing or compromising position. Special Agents should be

most circumspect when conducting interviews of Students for a

Democratic Society members and proper precautions taken to insure

that they do not become the subject of harassment by these individuals.

The Bureau should be promptly advised of any information coming to

the attention of the field regarding this matter.

Very truly yours,

IDENTIFICATION MATTERS - CHANGE OF PROCEDURE

INVOLVING FBI NUMBERS AND ELIMINATIONOF FORM 1-1 -

(RECORD OF ADDITIONAL ARRIST) - FBI FONV BOOK -- TO

stimulate greater participation among fingerprint contributors

in placing the FBI number on fingerprint cards the requirement

to submit a full set of fingerprints, 10 rolled impressions plus

plain impressions of the thumbs and 4 fingers of each hand, is

being rescinded in those instances where the FBI number is placed

on the submitted fingerprint card. Instead of a full set of finger~

prints, only the plain impressions of the 4 fingers of the right hand

need be placed in the proper block on the fingerprint card for

purpose of making a positive identification. The standard arrest

fingerprint card, form FD-249, should continue to be used. If

copy of record is NOT desired, check block on fingerprint card

provided for this purpose. If copy of record IS desired place such

notation under this block.

Form FD-249 has been revised lo

include blocks for both such notations; however, available stocks

of present form will be used until exhausted.

Since this procedure will eliminate the time-consuming

process of taking a full set of fingerprints and provide choice as to

requesting copy of the record when reporting an additional arrest

with FBI number, form 1-1 (Record of Additional Arrest) is being

eliminated. Remove sample 1-1 from FBI form book and any

unused copies should be destroyed. This procedure is being

placed in effect immediately and manual changes will be forth-

coming.

• (B) COUNTERFEIT MOTOR VEHICLE TITLES - INTERSTATE /

TRANSPORTATION OF STOLEN MOTOR VEHICLE - INTERSTATE

TRANSPORTATION OF STOLEN PROPERTY - A recent

Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor Vehicle - Ring case,

which was successfully investigated, involved a number of stolen

vehicles to which vehicle identification number plates stolen from

similar vehicles were affixed. The public identification numbers

were then altered to coincide with the stolen plates.

The vehicles were sold and retitled by using counterfeit

motor vehicle titles from another state.

The indictment in which the subjects were charged and

later convicted contained one count charging conspiracy in

knowingly transporting counterfeit securities in interstate

commerce in violation of the Interstate Transportation of Stolen

Property Statute, Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 2314. The

securities transported were the sounterfeit stolen motor vehicle

titles.

It should be noted that the definitions portion of the Statute,

Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 2311, in defining securities does

not specify motor vehicle titles but does include "instrument or

document or writing evidencing ownership of goods, wares, and

merchandise."

This should be brought to the attention of all investi-

gative personnel who are to be alert to the existence of similar

violations during the investigation of Interstate Transportation

of Stolen Motor Vehicle cases. Insure each situation indicating

a violation of this type is brought to the attention of the United

States Attorney for prosecutive consideration.

(C) DESTRECIION GI ARCHILI OR MOTOR VEHICLES - FALSE

REPORT (DAMV - FR) - BOMBING MATTERS - THREATS -

FEDERAL TRAIN WRECK STATUTE - CRIME ON THE HIGH

SEAS/- Recently a number of cases have been reported to the

Bureau under the Bombing Matters - Threats classification that

should have been handled in accordance with existing instructions

covering the DAMV - FR Statute.

You are reminded that the DAMV - FR Statute (18 USC

35) covers not only aircraft, motor vehicles, and their facilities

as mentioned in Chapter 2 of Title 18, but it also covers false

reports relating to violations mentioned in Chapters 97 and 111

of Title 18. Chapter 97 prohibits certain acts in connection

with railroads (Federal Train Wreck Statute). Chapter 111

contains numerous criminal provisions pertaining to shipping

(Crime on the High Seas). The False Report Section of the

DAMV Statute therefore includes all the various transportation

facilities mentioned in Chapters 2, 97, and 111 of Title 18. M

You should note, for example,

that placing a bomb or explosive

on any vessel of the United States, including ships of the Uf S.

Navy and Coast Guard, is a violation as set forth in Chapter 111

(18 USC 2275) and a false report to bomb such ships would

therefore be a violation of the DAMV - False Report Statute.

Bring this to the attention of all investigative

personnel.

(E) SOVIET NONO FFICIAL VISITORS WHO COME INDIVIDUALLY

TO THE UNITED STATES - There has been an ever-increasing

number of Soviet citizens who are traveling to the United States to

visit relatives or friends. These individuals are granted B-2 visas.

In almost all cases they apply for these visas through the American

Embassy in Moscow. Occasionally they have applied at the American

Embassy in Canada and in the future it will be possible for them to

apply for a visa at the American Embassy in Mexico or the American

Embassies in Europe as well.

Most Soviet nationals coming to the United States are

subject to a system of travel restrictions which requires them to

notify the Department of State of intended travel plans 48 hours in

advance and which closes about 25 per cent of the coyntry to them.

In 1962, individual Soviet tourists and exchange vistors were

exempted irom these regulations, but the Department of State

retained a degree of control over

•their travel. Individual tourists

were required to notify the Department of State of their travel plans

outside; the area specified in their visa.

The Department of State has advised that a new reporting

system has been developed. Henceforth, Embassies issuing visas to

private Soviet visitors coming to the United States to visit relatives

and friends will mark the visa of these visitors "Valid for travel to

(first destination in U. S.) and within a 25 mile radius thereof.

Inform the local office United States Immigration and Naturalization

'Service of travel plans outside the area. " Holders of such visas

will be informed that there is no restriction on their travel in the

United States but that they are required to keep the Immigration

and Naturalization Service District Office nearest them Informed

in advance of intended travel more than 25 miles from their first

destination.

These new travel regulations apply only to Soviet citizens

coming to the United States for the purpose of visiting friends or

relatives.

Immigration and Naturalization Headquarters is presently

formulating plans as to how this new procedure will be implemented

and what records will be maintained. When these plans are

finalized you will be furnished complete details. In the meantime,

Immigration and Naturalization Service District Offices will advise

the Bureau field offices when information is obtained concerning

travel of these Spiet visitors. Instructions in Section 105E,

Manual of Instructions, pertain to the investigative coverage to

be given to these individuals. It will not be necessary to advise the

Bureau on an individual basis when information of such travel is

furnished your office by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

(1) SOVIET-BLOC ATTEMPTS TO OBTAN U. S. MAPS -- The

Soviet-Blac Intelligence Services have placed considerable

emphasis upon the procurement of U. S. maps. Soviet-bloc

agents have used both open and covert activity to obtain such

data, and their efforts in this regard are comstantly increasing.

Recently, a ThIRD AGENCy CoNseRATioN official advised

that the Hungarian Government is directing letters to major cites

throughout the U.s. and is requesting appropriate civic olncials.

*of such cities to forward to Hungary detailed maps of the cities

contacted. Such mays, according to the Hungarian Government,

will be part of an International Exhibition to be held in Budapest,

Hungary, in November, 1967.

According to the

official, the

is very much concerned over this activity by the

Hungarian Government and has written letters to 20 major cities

in the U. S. suggesting that these municipal governments refrain

from providing maps to the Hungarian Government. The

is keenly interested in receiving any information

disclosing Soviet-bloc efforts to obtain U. S. maps and has

requested that any information received by the Federal Bureau of

Investigation in this, connection be brought in the

attention.

This matter should be brought to the attention of all

personnel in each office who handle Soviet-bloc matters. Any

information received disclosing Soviet-bloc efforts to obtain

U. S. maps shouid be promptly furnishea to the Bureau in a

letterhed memorandum suitable for dissemination. The

• letterheid memorandum should be captioned "Soviet-Bloc

Attempts to Obtain U. S. Maps."

LIST -- The Department of Defense has issued a revised Key

Facilities List reierred to as KFL (2) dated April 1, 1957.

Appropriate state sections of this list, which replaces KFL

the Plant Informant Program.

It will be noted that the new list does not contain a

listing of the agency having security responsibility for each key

facility as did previous Key Facilities Lists. The Department

of Defense has advised this deletion was made due to the fact

that the Army has now been designated the agency having security

responsibility for all key facilities, and it is, therefore, not

necessary to identify the responsible agency for each individual

key facility on the Key Facilities List.

(A) ACTIVITIES OF MILITANT ANTI-CASTRO EXILES -- On several

occasions during the past six months you have been alerted to the

po sablty attack atre Stablishmet a this the or ality travel

these exiles may attempt to harm, demonstrate against, or embarrass

Cuban President Osvaldo Dorticos and Prime Minister Fidel Castro it

they go to Canada to visit EXPO 67 in July, 1967, and/or to attend the

Pan American Games scheduled to be held in the latter part of July and

the early part of August, 1967.

We have now received concrete information indicating that

Cuban exiles are planning the assassination and kidnapping of several

Cuban officials in Canada.

In this connection, a New York source has reported that the

Movimiento Nacionalista Cubana (Cuban Nationalist Movement - CNM):

a militant anti-Castro group, is planning an attempt on the life of

Prime Minister Castro if he visits EXPO 67, Montreal, Canada, on

July 26, 1967, Cuban National Day at the exposition. In addition, the

source reported that if Castro does not appear the CNM in union with the

Movimiento Insurreccional de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MIRR),

another militant anti-Castro organization, plans to kidnap the Cuban

Ambassador to Canada and hold him for the ransom of nine prisoners

in Cuba who were captured during the ill-fated invasion of Cuba in April,

1961. Reportedly, the exiles intend to kill the Cuban Ambassador to

Canada regardless of whether the prisoners are released.

The CNM is also considering the possibility of a simultaneous

action at the Pan American Games which are to be held in Winnipeg,

Canada, from July 27, 1967, to August 8, 1967. This action will involve

the kidnapping of some of the Cuban athletes participating in the games

including the Cuban Minister of Sports, Jose Llanusa, who will accompany

the Cuban team.

The Bureau cannot stress too strongly the absolute necessity

of alerting sources and informants to immediately report information

concerning plans of Cuban exiles and others to assassinate, injure, bomb,

(D) INVESTIGATIONS OF KLAN AND HATE-TYPE ORGANIZATIONS

REPORTS AND LETTERHEAD MEMORANDA) -- The Counter-

Department of the Air Force, and the Commander, Naval Intelligence

Command, have requested that the Bureau modify its policy for

dissemination of Klan matters to their agencies.

In accordance with the requests made, all future dissemination

to the Air Force of Klan reports should be limited to organizational

reports, and reports and letterhead memoranda showing significant

trends and developments within the Klan groups. Dissemination of

Klan reports and letterhead memoranda concerning individuals shouid

no longer be made to the Air Force with the exception of those

containing information of Air Force interest, such as the involvement

of U. S. Air Force military or civilian personnel.

In the event there is any doubt as to whether Klan reports

or letterhead memoranda on individuals should be disseminated to

the Air Force, resolve the doubt by disseminating.

The Navy made a similar request of the Bureau, however,

stated that this request pertained only to dissemination of Klan

matters to Naval Headquarters in Washington, D. C. In view of

this, you should continue disseminating all Klan reports and letter-

head memoranda to the regional offices of the Navy.

Concerning hate-group organizations and members,

dissemination of all reports and letterhead memoranda should be

made to the Army, Navy, and Air Force.

In the event information is developed which is of interest

to another agency in the Executive Branch of the Government, this

information should be disseminated to that agency.

Appropriate Manual changes follow.

IN ANTIWAR PROPAGANDA -- Recent newspaper publicity confirmed

by the United States Army indicates a captured North Vietnamese

military Army document instructed North Vietnamese military

personnel to remove personal effects from the bodies of dead and

wounded United States military personnel which effects would be

passed on to unidentified protest groups in the United States. The

captured order indicated these personal belongings would be used,

in an unknown manner, to mobilize the American people against

United States involvement in Vietnam.

(A) TELEPHONES - FEDERAL TELÉCOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM

(FTS) - INTERO FFICE LONG- DISTANCE TELEPHONE SERVICE --

The Bureau has reached agreement with General Services Admini-

stration (GSA) to have FTS service installed in all domestic continental

field offices, including Sacramento, except Anchorage, Alaska, where

it is not available at this time.

Installation will be made by the local telephone companies.

Some installations may be accomplished in less than 30 days, others

may take up to 90 days. Except for Bureau Headquarters and the 15

field offices now using FTS, it may not be used elsewhere until the

installation in each of the 40 additional offices has been completed

and the Bureau orders it put into simultaneous use.

No major change in a field office telephone system may be

made in connection with the FTS installation without Bureau approval.

For example, if there is no additional trunk capacity on the switch-

board to accommodate the FTS trunks, replacement of the entire

telephone switchboard system at a considerable increase in monthly

fixed costs will not be considered simply to accommodate the FTS

trunks. In such cases the FTS trunks will probably be installed on

separate instruments or brought in on key (push button) instruments

now used for the SAC's, ASAC's and night supervisors'

extensions

off the switchboard.

The American Telephone and Telegraph Company in

installations and act as liaison with the local telephone companies.

Bring to the Bureau's attention promptly, any problems you

encounter in connecting FTS to your office, furnishing sufficient

mechanical details and name, title, and telephone number of local

telephone company representative for prompt action by the Bureau.

(B) TRAINING - LEGAL INSTRUCTION AND LIAISON -- It has been sug-

gested from the field that the principal legal instructor in the field offices

be assigned to a more intensive program of instruction and liaison. In-

struction in the law will be given to investigative personnel of the field

offices and to police agencies desiring such training. The liaison will be

with judges, bar associations, prosecuting attorneys, law schools, public

defenders, the State Attorney's Office, prominent lawyers and ranking

police officials.

The Bureau has adopted this suggestion. You are instructed to

immediately assign your most capable legal instructor to the program.

The instructor must give instructions at least once each fiscal

year to all investigative personnel assigned at that time to the office, on the

following legal subjects: the law of arrest, search of the person, search of

motor vehicles, search of premises, interrogation, the McNabb-Mallory rule,

and lineups. You may suggest other subjects for approval if you believe them

necessary. These lectures are not to be summarized or combined. Each

lecture must be thorough and must be given as a separate subject. Each may

be given during voluntary overtime.

The instructor must assist as much as possible in the preparation

of complaints for arrest warrants and affidavits for search warrants to make

sure that each meets the requirements of the law. This will involve close

consultation with the United States Attorney or one of his assistants.

The instructor must recognize and take necessary action on

changes in the Federal law peculiar to his jurisdiction which may come from

court opinions, policy decisions of the United States Attorney, or other sources.

For example, field offices in the Tenth Circuit now must follow the decision in

Simpson v. U.S., 346 F2d 291 (1965) which holds that it is an unreasonable

search for an Agent or other officer of the law to examine the motor and serial

numbers of an impounded car, where the object is to obtain evidence of a crime,

unless such examination is authorized by a search warrant, conducted incident

to arrest, or accomplished with the consent of the accused. See also, U.J. y.

Nikrasch, 367 F2d 740 (1966). To the contrary, field offices in the Ninth Circuit

follow the decision of their Court of Appeals which disagrees with Simpson and

holds that it is not a "search" merely to check the serial number on an

automobile in order to more positively identify the vehicle, and that even if

it is a search, it is a reasonable one.

Cotton v. U.S., 371 F2d 385 (1967).

See also, Weaver v. U.S., 347 F2d 878 (5th Cir., 1967); U.S. v. Kennell,

- F2d - (4th Cir. 2/16/67) (per curiam). Such differences in the law

exist until the issue has been finally decided, usually by the Supreme Court,

and require adjustment in our procedures according to the district and circuit

in which the office is situated. Similar isolated requirements peculiar to a

district or circuit may arise from the views of a particular judge or prosecutor.

Necessary action may include, according to the circumstances,

discussion of the problem between the Special Agent in Charge and the United

States Attorney, new instructions to all investigative personnel of the office,

or referral to Bureau Headquarters.

Another duty of the instructor will be to monitor FBI lineups

to assure proper procedures, and to assist in resolving any other legal problem

of the law in a Bureau case.

Special care must be taken to work with the United

States Attorney as closely as possible in each case and, as necessary, to keep

the Bureau advised.

The instructor must also develop and fully exploit all reasonable

possibilities in teaching to state and local law enforcement officers the Federal

constitutional principles of arrest, search, interrogation, lineups, etc., which

control those officers. Observance of these principles by state and local officers

has become highly important to Federal law enforcement. State and local

officers originate many Federal cases, and measurably affect the outcome

of these cases by their official acts. For example, if the police search was

unreasonable the Federal agency which takes the case over is not allowed to

use in court the evidence found in that search.

All legal instruction must take a positive approach. The

instructor constantly must emphasize, and appropriately illustrate with

actual court decisions, how the Agent or officer can find and evaluate the

information making probable cause for arrest or for a search warrant, the

various ways of searching a person, a vehicle, or premises, which the courts

have approved, and the latitude which the Miranda decision allows for lawful

interrogation of an accused. The instructor must emphasize what can be done

within the law, attempting to build confidence with knowledge.

Liaison with other officials and agencies is designed to keep

them constantly aware of the Bureau's expertise in legal training, the Bureau's

interest in developing the legal capacities of all law enforcement officers, and

to learn from them any information which will serve the purposes of the

Bureau and law enforcement. Much of what is accomplished will depend upon

the ability and enthusiasm of the instructor to whom this work is assigned.

Much information can be of use to the Bureau. For example, there is now

pending in the Florida courts a case in which the Supreme Court of Florida

may rule on the extent to which instrumentalities of a crime seized by Bureau

Agents in the arrest of a person wanted for Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution

can be used as evidence in the state courts. The McNabb-Mallory Rule has been

adopted in some states, and the Jencks Rule has been extended to the Virgin

Islands. States adopt, or fail to adopt, significant statutory changes in the

law such as the "Stop and Frisk"' Act in New York, Alabama, and Nebraska,

new statutes on search warrants, etc. All of this information is significant

to the Bureau for training purposes in both the FBI National Academy and local

police schools. It is to be reported to the Bureau.

You are instructed to make sure that the Agent assigned to this

duty has ample time and facilities to perform the duties imposed upon him.

Extensive instruction material is provided to you by the Training Division but

the instructor cannot teach by simply reciting what he receives.

He must have

an opportunity to study, digest and understand this material and to research

principles of law and decisions as necessary.

This program is a part of the Bureau's continuing effort

to operate most efficiently and effectively and to do so by methods which

continue to merit the approbation of the courts, the government in general,

and the public. It is also an attempt to measurably improve the operations

of Federal, state and local law enforcement in both Federal and other cases.

You are instructed to give it your complete support and to take any action

necessary to make sure that it reaches maximum effectiveness in your office.

(C) ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE DRIVE AGAINST GAMBLING AND

ORGANIZED CRIME -- The increase in statistical accomplishments in

the Bureau's drive against the hoodlum element during Fiscal Year 1967

is most encouraging. One hundred and ninety-seven convictions were

recorded for violations of antigambling statutes or under other Bureau

jurisdiction against representatives of organized crime.

The Attorney General has acknowledged the fine record of ac-

complishment established by the Bureau during the fiscal year just con-

cluded. In the light of current interest in matters pertaining to organized

crime, it has been indicated that matters of this nature have the highest

priority for Federal law enforcement.

In view of the ever-expanding efforts of the organized criminal

element and the continuing demands that their activities be suppressed,

it is anticipated that the Bureau, in its position of leadership in this field,

will be expected to surpass previous records by a substantial margin in the

coming fiscal year. Intelligence information with respectto illegal gambling

operations would suggest our previous record should be increased twofold.

Analysis of the accomplishments of the various field offices has

indicated that some offices have contributed substantially to the overall

record, and it will be necessary for these offices to redouble their efforts.

Other offices have not demonstrated any degree of success in effecting

prosecution in the drive against organized criminal elements. These

offices must make an immediate, forthright, all-out effort to secure

tangible results.

It is recognized that a substantial number of individuals are

presently under indictment or in various phases of prosecution short of

trial. While these offer a backlog for future statistical accomplishments,

we cannot rely on results of these cases to give us the substantial increase

in accomplishments which will be expected of us at the end of this fiscal

year. Therefore, appropriate steps must be taken to develop new cases

not only in the antigambling category but by utilizing all Bureau statutory

authority to develop cases having prosecutive potential.

I can assure you that your record in antigambling cases as well

as your record of accomplishments against representatives of the organized

criminal element will receive close scrutiny during the months to come,

and you will be held responsible for taking the necessary steps to insure

that our responsibilities in this field are fulfilled.

(D) NATIONAL CRIME INFORMATION CENTER (NCIC) - INDEXING

OF CURRENCY; NATIONAL STOLEN PROPERTY FILE (NSPF) --

By SAC Letter 67-18 (D) you were advised of the inclusion in the NCIC

Stolen Article File and Stolen/Missing Gun File of property and guns

identifiable by serial number previously listed in the National Stolen

Property File. Included in the instructions were the necessary elements

for indexing currency, i.e., such entry must include (1) type,

(2) denomination, (3) serial number, and (4) series year, including

letter suffix.

Care should be taken to include the letter suffix to series year

in any listing of currency when such a suffix exists. This includes

listings on Bureau form FD-339 re ransom money, et cetera.

Currency entries being received at the Bureau are no longer in-

dexed in NSP.F but are being placed in NCIC. Where the NCIC criteria

is not met, currency is not being indexed at the Seat of Government.

Those currency items previously indexed in NSPF which meet NCIC

criteria are being converted to NCIC files. Currency index cards in

NSPF not meeting NCIC criteria will be destroyed one year after the

date of theft. Since experience has shown that the lapse of time

diminishes the value of a search of such entries and, where some

identifying elements are missing, the listing is of no evidentiary value.

You should be guided by the following considerations when

indexing currency in field office indices:

Those offices which have terminal facilities for entering data

into the NCIC will make currency entries directly into the NCIC and

need not index these items in field office indices since they have the

capability of making direct inquiries of the NCIC.

Other offices not having NCIC terminals which submit currency

to the Bureau for indexing in the NCIC should also index this currency

in field office indices provided all four elements required for indexing

are met.

NW 55069 DocId: 32989528 Page 609

## Page 610

Partially identifiable currency which does not qualify for entry

in NCIC, but which the office of origin feels should be indexed for pos-

sible lead value, may be so indexed in field office indices. Such items

may also be furnished to neighboring offices for indexing if this

procedure is considered appropriate. When the indexing of such items

no longer serves any purpose, it is the responsibility of the office of

origin to so notify offices previously receiving the items and all index

cards should be destroyed. Notification must also be sent to the Bureau

in those instances where items in this category were indexed at the

Bureau prior to NCIC and have not yet been purged from the NSPF.

Index cards pertaining to currency also indexed in NCIC should

be destroyed at the end of the calendar year following the year in which

the index cards are prepared. The NCIC index will automatically be

purged at the same time. In those cases where the office of origin

deems it appropriate to hold these records in NCIC and in field office

files for an additional period, the Bureau must be advised no later than

30 days prior to the purge date.

The NCIC will provide a central file for currency items which

may be inquired upon by field offices. Where a rapid check of NCIC

is necessary, you should direct a teletype to NCIC, TWX Number

710-822-0006.

It is essential where indexing is no longer required in NCIC,

your field office, or neighboring field offices which have been furnished

currency items for indexing,

that prompt notification be given so that

such references may be removed.

Appropriate manual changes are being made.

(E) CUBAN POTENTIAL FOR SABOTAGE ÄGAINST THE UNITED

STATES - In its efforts to subvert existing governments in Latin

America, it is known that the Government of Cuba has been involved in

the infiltration of guerrilla forces, arms and equipment into various

South American countries. Most recently a Cuban fishing vessel was

used in May, 1967, in an abortive attempt to land a guerrilla force in

Venezuela.

Within the past two years, the Cuban fishing fleet has increased

at an accelerated pace and has operated on a wide scale in the Atlantic

Ocean as well as in the Pacific. The use to which the Cuban fishing fleet

has been employed against Latin-American countries highlights the

vulnerability of the shores of the United States to surreptitious infiltration

of Cuban saboteurs. While no evidence has been uncovered to date in-

dicating that the Cuban fishing fleet has been operated against the United

States in the landing of saboteurs and subversives, nevertheless, in view

of the violent antipathy of the Government of Cuba toward the United

States, we must remain alert for such efforts.

In line with our investigative responsibilities, particularly

as they apply to our jurisdiction over the sabotage statutes, it is in-

cumbent on each field office to be alert for any indication of planned or

actual acts of sabotage against the United States. In this connection, it

is imperative that informants and sources be developed and maintained

to the degree that you will be aware of the presence of potential Cuban

saboteurs within your territory. Any such information obtained should

be furnished to the Bureau promptly.

(F) CUBAN CLANDESTINE OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES --

Recent information in the press discloses that Stokely Carmichael,

foremost "Black Power" advocate of violence, has been in Cuba as an

official guest of the Castro government attending the Latin-American

Solidarity Organization (LASO) conference. Since the avowed purpose

of the LASO is to plan ways and means to overthrow U. S. "imperialism"

in Latin America by revolutionary violence, Carmichael's presence at

the conference takes on added significance and could presage Castro's

clandestine involvement in the current racial strife in the U.S.

Accordingly, all offices be most alert to any indication of

such involvement on the part of Castro agents or sympathizers or any

indication that support, direction or influence of current or future

racial violence in the U. S. is emanating from Havana.

(B) RABBLE ROUSER INDEX (SUBVERSIVE CONTROL) -- Effective

immediately in view of the widespread racial unrest the Bureau will

maintain a Rabble Rouser Index.

This Index will consist of the names,

identifying data, and background information of individuals who are known

rabble rousers and who have demonstrated by their actions and speeches

that they have a propensity for fomenting racial disorder. It is desired

that only individuals of prominence who are of national interest be in-

cluded on this Index. Particular consideration should be given to recom-

mending those individuals in this category who travel extensively. Such

individuals as H. Rap Brown and Stokely Carmichael of the Student

Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and George Lincoln Rockwell of the

American Nazi Party are typical examples of the type of individuals to

be included. The fact that an individual is on the Security Index or

Reserve Index does not preclude his inclusion on the Rabble Rouser

Index.

Each Special Agent in Charge is instructed to submit a letter

under the above caption to the Bureau within 15 days from the date of

this letter setting forth the identity of the individuals residing within

field divisions who are being recommended for inclusion on the Rabble

Rouser Index. An original and four copies of a separate write-up

should be submitted regarding each individual recommended in accord-

ance with the enclosed sample format. Make certain that information

contained in the succinct resume of activities section of the Index card

clearly shows the reason the individual should be included on the Index.

If Bureau concurs with the recommendation one copy of the write-up

will be stamped approved and returned to the field office. These ap-

proved write-ups should be retained by the field office in alphabetical

order in a loose-leaf binder labeled Rabble Rouser Index. This Index

should be afforded the same security as the Security Index. After

submission of the initial letter, any necessary changes, deletions, or

additions should be made and the original and four copies of corrected

write-ups should be forwarded to the Bureau by letter under the above

caption. An administrative tickler should be prepared to review the

Index every three months to insure that all information is current and

accurate. Appropriate Manual changes are being prepared.

RE: WIRE TAPPING AND ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCES -

RECORD-KEEPING PROCEDURES

- 4.

By airtel dated June 29, 1967, you were furnished a

copy of the Attorney General's memorandum dated June 16, 1967,

setting out regulations concerning wire tapping and electronic eaves-

dropping. These rules do not apply to investigations directly related

to the protection of the nationai security or any authorized telephone

surveillance.

The instructions will apply where microphones are

utilized and prescribe that Bureau personnel monitoring the micro-

phone surveillance shall (I) preserve the tape or other permanent

record of conversations; (2) submit a written report setting out actual

use made of each electronic device in connection with the authorization;

(3) such report, the tapes or other permanent records, any logs,

transcripts, summaries or memoranda and similar material prepared

shall be (a) treated as agency records, (b) specially classified, filed

and safeguarded, and (c) shall not be made available, nor information

contained therein, to agency personnel or others except when essential

to Government operations; and (4) a record shall be made and retained

concerning each person to whom such information or material has been

made available.

Existing Bureau instructions contained in No Number

SAC Letter dated December 22, 1949, comply with the first three

requirements set out above. However, in order to insure full com-

pliance with the Attorney General's instructions, you must see to it

that these rules are adhered to in all investigations other than those

directly related to the protection of the national security where any

type of microphone surveillance has been authorized and used. All

the original tapes, logs, summaries, airtels, transcripts, trans-

lations, and similar material immediately recording the result of

conversations overheard or pertaining to the installation must be

permanently retained, marked and treated as "JUNE" material,

classified into the appropriate "sub-one" or "sub-two" files, main-

tained separate from regular office files in a locked room, where

possible, and in locked file cabinets in every instance. An absolute

minimum number of specially selected employees should process,

handle, and have access to this material, and a permanent record

must be kept of their identities. Initials or employee numbers placed

on each document by those processing it should disclose who has

handled it. It should be hand-carried where possible.

In connection with item number 4 of the Attorney

General's instructions, the Department has been informed that in

view of the tight controls outlined above, the Bureau would not main-

tain a separate record of individual employees who might have access

to this data in the normal course of business. It was explained that

this information might necessarily be referred to or briefly paraphrased

in investigative reports and to maintain a detailed record concerning

the identities of all clerical and Special Agent personnel who must handle

or review such derivative references would require voluminous and

unnecessary record keeping. Accordingly, such records will not be

required; however, personnel other than those having an actual need

to know must not be permitted to examine the original material and its

contents must not be discussed with employees not authorized to handle

it.

Communications to the Bureau regarding microphone

surveillances shall continue to be labeled "JUNE" and enclosed in a

separate, sealed envelope designated for the Bureau with this code

word also indicated thereon.

Also, all other existing instructions are continued

insofar as nonusage of microphones by the FBI is concerned.

AMTORG TRADING CORPORATION

Amtorg Trading Corporation, according to records of

the New York County Clerk, is a New York corporation formed

in 1924. It has acted since then as a buying and selling agency

in the United States for most of the foreign trade organizations

of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Since 1949, it has

been registered with the United States Department of Justice

pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign Agents Registration

Act of 1938, as amended

CASA DE LAS AMERICAS

On May 1, 1967, a source advised that the Casa de las

Americas, an organization composed of pro-Fidel Castro and pro-

communist individuals, formed in April, 1964, has moved its

headquarters to the fourth floor, 876 Broadway, New York City,

effective April 30, 1967. Source described this organization

as a successor to the old Casa Cuba Club (CCC) with a changed

name to avoid overt affiliation with Cuba.

The CCC has been

composed of persons belonging to the now defunct 26th of July

Movement, a revolutionary organization founded and led by

Fidel Castro, Prime Minister of Cuba, until its dissolution in

1962.

A second source advised that the CCC, originally

founded as a social club by New York area residents of. Cuban

extraction, was sympathetic to Castro during his struggle for

power.

Subsequent to January 1, 1959, as it became apparent

that communism was the form of

government in Cuba, the leaders

of the 26th of July Movement assumed control of CCC and its

membership declined.

The first source above advised that Casa de las

Americas is also ostensibly formed as a social club, but in

effect it acts as a focal point for revolutionary peoples

sympathetic to the Cuban government. Although it is not directly

controlled by the Cuban Mission to the United Nations (CHUN),

many Cuban personnel attend its functions and at least an indirect

link with CMUN is present.

Casa de las Americas has fund-raising

affairs and contributes money to the CHUN.

Casa de las Americas

also gives financial support to other revolutionary groups repre-

senting countries other than Cuba.

Through ChUN, various

propaganda materials of a communist nature are found at Casa de

las Americas.

This same source also stated that some executive

committee members, as well as general members of Casa de las

Americas, are members of the Spanish Section of the Communist

Party, USA. Source feels that although there is no direct link

between Casa de las Americas and the Communist Party, USA

(CPUSA); an indirect link does occur at Casa de las Americas

in that

it is used as a staging ground prior to entry into

CPUSA. Further, source indicates that membership in Casa de

las Americas prepares an excellent background for persons

desiring to return to Cuba..

This same source stated that although there exists

in Cuba a social club called Casa de las Americas supported

by the Cuban government, there appears to be no connection

between the two and no reason to believe that the Casa de las

• Americas in New York was named after the one in Cuba.

MOVIMIENTO PRO- INDEPENDENCIA DE PUERTO RICO

(PUERTO RICAN INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT) (MPIPR)

The MPIPR was organized in November, 1959, at Ponce,

Puerto Rico, to work for the independence of

Puerto Rico. It

has an estimated membership of between 1,000 and 1,300 people

with missions throughout the island of

Puerto Rico, and in

New York, New York; Chicago, Illinois; and Buffalo, New York.

At the time the MPIPR was organized it was indicated

that it did not advocate violence but would accept members who

did.

Juan Mari Bras, the founder and dominant leader of this

organization, in a speech during March, 1964, threatened violence

comparable to that in Algeria if Puerto Rico

• became a state within

the United States.

A source reported in 1956 that a leader of

the MPIPR indicated that "the Revolution would soon begin" and

another source advised that another official of this organization

had

attempted to obtain a number of automatic pistols.

Articles praising Fidel Castro and the Cuban Government

regularly appear in MPIPR publications. In 1961, the MPIPR

adopted a resolution expressing 100 per cent approval of and

solidarity with the Cuban revolution.

It sent a delegation to

the Tri-Continental Conference of African, Asian, and Latin

American People, held in Havana, Cuba, during January, 1966, and

it maintains a permanent delegate to the Sécretariat located in

Havana.

The press of Puerto Rico has reported that the MPIPR

has held numerous demonstrations protesting compulsory milftary

service for Puerto Ricans and United States policy in Vietnam

and the Dominican Republic.

In December, 1966, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed

into law a bill calling for

a plebiscite on July 23, 1967, to

determine the future political status, of Puerto Rico. The press

reported that this plebiscite has been denounced vociferously by

the MPIPR as "an act of Yankee imperialism to maintain the

colonial status of Puerto Rico." Juan Mari Bras stated that the

MPIPR had asked the Cuban Government for "militant solidarity

with our struggle, in all international forums to which Red Cuba

has access."

MUSLIM GIRLS TRAINING

On May 19, 1960, a source advised the Muslim Girls

Training (MGT) is a

group

within the Nation Of Islam (NOI)

and is composed' of all female members of the NOl. The MGT is

similar in structure

to the Fruit of Islam (FOI), which is

composed of male members of the NOI, in that the MGT has

officers similar to military organizations to whom other fe-

male members are accountable. MGT members receive

instructions

in homemaking, hygiene, calisthenics, and other subjects such

as Muslim history, and the English language.

There

also exists

a Junior MGT, which is. composed of female members of the NoI

who are between the ages of 15 and 19 and who are afforded

military-type drill.

Since 1957, various officers and "sisters" of the MGT

have, at meetings of

the MGT, used the term MGT so that it also

means General Civilization Class. General Civilization Class

refers to classes conducted within the MGT.

The above refers to activities of the MGT at

Muhammad's Temple of Islam No. 2, 5335 South Greenwood, Chicago,

reseam to. 2,

Illinois.

On May #, 1967, another source advised that, in theory,

the MGT exists in all Temples of the NOI and is patterned after

The NOI is

an all-Negro organization which was

- originally organized

in 1930 in Detroit, Michigan.

Muhammad

claims to have been selected by Allah, the Supreme Being, to

lead the so-called Negro race out of

slavery in the wilderness

of North America by establishing an independent black nation in

the United States.

Members following Muhanmad's teachings and

his interpretation of the

"Koran" believe there is no such thing

as a Negro; the so-called Negroes are slaves lof the white race,

referred to as "white

devils," in the United States; and the

white race, because of its exploitation of the so-called Negroes,

must and will be destroyed in the approaching "War of Armageddon."

•In, the past, officials and members of the NOI, including

Muhammad, have refused to register under the provisions

of the

Selective Service Acts and have declared that members owe no

allegiance, to the United States.

On May 5, 1958, the first source advised Muhammad had,

upon advice of legal counsel, tempered his personal statements

and instructions to his ministers concerning the principles of

his organization in order to avoid possible prosecution by the

United States Government; however, he did not indicate any

fundamental changes in the teachings of his organization.

"On May 2,

1966, a third source advised muhammad had,

In early July, 1958, decided to de-emphasize the religious as-

pects of the teachings of Islam and to stress the economic

benefits to be derived by those Negroes who joined the Noi.

This policy change, according to Muhammad, would help him acquire

additional followers and create more interest in his programs.

COMMITTEE FOR THE FOURTH INTERNATIONAL

On April 17, 1967, a source'advised as follows:

Tim Hohlforth, when a member of the Socialist Horkers

Party (SYP) National Committee, led a minority group of ten

accusing the majority of losing revolutionary perspective. The

Wolforth group adhered to the views of British Trotskyists,

with whom it secretly consorted, and with certain co-thinkers

in the International Committee of the Fourth International (FI),

a world Trotskyist organization. It accused the leadership of

adopting views of these within the FI who favored "bureaucratic.

revolution over the genuine "revolutionary working-class outlook"

of Leon Trotsky. Domestically, the Wohlforth faction opposed

SHP orientation toward student activity,

place major emphasis on trade unions and participation in the

(A) FLU INOCULATION PROGRAM - 1967-1968 -- Promptly make

arrangements to reinstitute a flu program with shots to be given early

in October, 1967, and any booster shots needed should be completed

early in December, 1967. Order vaccine by routing slip directed to

the Property Management Unit, Room 5266. Revised Adult and Minor

Waiver forms (3-343 and 3-343a respectively) should be promptly

ordered by routing slip directed to the Supply Unit, Room B-216.

When this program is completed advise the Personnel Section no later

than December 31, 1967, of the (a) total personnel; (b) number inoculated;

and (c) doctor's fee. Destroy the waiver forms six months after the

› program is completed. Make efforts now to secure a physician to

supervise administration of your inoculations to insure they commence

early in October.

Before ordering your supply of vaccine canvass employees now

so the quantity of your order will be accurate. Vaccine must be kept under

refrigeration but freezing it destroys the potency. Order the vaccine only

from the Bureau. Insure the administering physician is aware that the

vaccine is of the Bivalent type and that 1. 0 ml should be given subcutaneously

per inoculation as medically recommended. The Surgeon General's

Advisory Committee again recommends that individuals vaccinated since

July, 1963, need receive but a single dose of vaccine and for those needing

a booster shot, this be given two months after the preliminary shot.

Medical forecast indicates that substantial numbers of cases of A2 influenza

can be expected to occur during the 1967-1968 flu season. Medical

advice reveals that the newly introduced Bivalent vaccine containing only

A2 and B strains has been prepared this year for general use to provide

greater protection against current strains of flu than has previously been

possible and that older strains in Polyvalent vaccine do not play a significant

role against the currently prevalent viruses. Surplus vaccine should be

returned Air Mail Special Delivery to the Health Service Unit, Seat of

Government, immediately following competion of the program. The

physician may be paid up to $100 per day and any excess charge should

be submitted to the Bureau in accordance with existing procedures. Make

these inoculations available on a voluntary, cost-free basis.

• Last year 48. 2 per cent of all employees participated in this

program. Make every effort to stimulate greater interest to increase

participation rate. This should be done particularly considering the current

forecast and in an effort to minimize the effects of flu and reduce absenteeism.

Several alternate candidates were investigated for the 80th

Session of the National Academy and were not invited to attend that

session in view of lack of space. Unless advised to the contrary, if

their background investigation was favorable, they will be considered the

first choice for the 81st Session from the field office covering their law

enforcement agency.

All candidates nominated for the 81st Session must have been

interviewed by the current Special Agent in Charge. If such has not

been done, appropriate interview form should be submitted along with

surveys of race and national origin of employees. Self-designation

questionnaires should no longer be given to newly appointed or older

In the future such data will be collected only through

visual survey in the form of gross statistics (no names -- overall

figures only). Civil Service Commission advised an agency may not

collect or maintain any record of race or national origin of individual

employees even on an anonymous or confidential basis and gross data

may be kept in a personnel office. Self-designation may be used to

answer a complaint of discrimination when the visual survey method

is not adequate. Civil Service Commission advised visual surveys may

be conducted by supervisors. Bureau authority should be sought before

the release of any minority group statistics.

indicating that certain leaders of LCN employ electronic technicians

to survey their homes and business establishments to determine if they

are covered by electronic devices. In addition, it was reported these

technicians are also utilized to install electronic coverage of LCN

members and other racket figures suspected of being informants.

All Agents must be alerted to this possibility and reminded

of the urgent necessity to afford complete security to our top echelon

informants and other sources.

Agents handling top echelon informants must take every

possible precaution to insure that our sources are not compromised.

Particular emphasis should be placed upon interviewing your sensitive

sources under absolutely secure conditions.

Our top echelon sources have reported that the leaders of

LCN are gravely concerned about the possibility that some of their

members may be informants. Their awareness of this possibility

serves to point out the need to handle our sources with particular care

and discretion.

You are reminded that dissemination of information from

your informants must be handled in line with existing instructions. All

Agents conducting interviews in connection with the Criminal Intelligence

Program or contacting police officials must make certain that their

sources are not inadvertently identified by revealing information emanating

from such sources.

Member-informants in LCN are our most effective weapons

in the drive against organized crime and must be handled in the manner

which precludes the possibility of jeopardizing their security.

These instructions should be brought to the attention of

(E) REPLACEMENT STANDARDS FOR FURNITURE AND OFFICE

MACHINES -- In consonance with the objectives of the President, set

forth in his memorandum of September 16, 1966, on cost reduction in

procurement, supply and property management, General Services

Administration (GSA) has revised the replacement standards for

furniture and office machines as shown below:

Furniture Replacement Standard

Furniture shall not be replaced unless the estimated cost of

repair or rehabilitation (based on GSA term contracts), including any

transportation expense, exceeds at least 75 percent of the cost of a new

item of the same type and class (based on prices as shown in the current

edition of the GSA Stock Catalog, applicable Federal Supply Schedules,

or the lowest available market price). An exception is authorized in

those unusual situations when rehabilitation of the furniture at 75 per-

cent of the cost of a new item would not extend its useful life for a

period compatible with the cost of rehabilitation, as determined by the

agency head or his designee.

Office Machines Replacement Standard

Replacement of office machines shall be in accordance with

the standards prescribed in A and B, below. The acquisition cost of

comparable machines may be obtained from applicable Federal Supply

Schedules with due consideration given to prices obtainable when the

quantities involved exceed the maximum order limitation. In such

instances, price information, unless available within the agency, may

be obtained from the contracting office indicated in the Schedule.

Estimated repair or overhaul costs shall be obtained from contractors

providing service under GSA term contracts where provided or at the

lowest rate available from other sources. Cost obtained shall include

transportation costs.

A.

Electrically operated office machines (typewriters, adding

machines, comptometers, and desk calculators, excluding the electronic

type) under 12 years of age or manually operated office machines under

15 years of age shall not be replaced unless:

(1) The estimated one-time repair or overhaul cost of a

machine under eight years of age exceeds 50 percent of the replacement

cost for a comparable new model, without regard to trade-in or sale

value; or

(2) The estimated one-time repair or overhaul cost of a

machine eight years of age and over exceeds 25 percent of the replace-

ment cost for a comparable new model, without regard to trade-in or

sale value.

B. Notwithstanding the limitations prescribed in "A", above,

office machines may be replaced under the following conditions provided

a written justification supporting such replacement is approved by the

agency head or an authorized designee and is retained in the agency

(1) In those cases where there is a continuing history of

breakdowns with corresponding loss of productivity through downtime.

Judgments in these cases should be based upon personal knowledge of

the machine operator or supervisor, and by repair records; or

(2) When office machines lack essential features required in

the performance of a particular task which is continuing in nature and

other suitable machines are not readily available. However, this

condition shall not be used to support replacement of typewriters.

These standards should be taken into consideration prior to

recommending replacement of furniture and/or office machines and

when such a recommendation is submitted to the Bureau sufficient

information should be furnished to provide supporting justification for

the replacement.

(F) HARASSMENT OF BUREAU AGENTS BY THE KLAN -- Information

was received from a racial informant to the effect that a klansman, who

has been involved in racial violence in the past, was contemplating use

of a ball-point pen device containing a drug which causes heart failure,

on Bureau Agents.

The FBI Laboratory examined this drug and ascertained

that it is used in general surgery to produce rapid and complete

relaxation of skeletal muscles for brief periods. Ordinarily, the drug

is administered by injection. It is used with caution since average

doses may result in experiencing difficulty in breathing and excessive

doses may cause respiratory failure. In medical practice, it is

administered by anesthetists or others qualified to manage respiratory

failure. An excessive dose could lead to oxygen deficiency and be a

contributing cause to cardiac arrest (heart failure).

The ball-point pen device allegedly will hold the drug mixed

with water in the barrel of the pen and when the pen head is depressed,

which normally would place the ball point in position, a needle is

exposed through which the drug can be injected.

You should insure that all Agent personnel handling Klan

matters are alerted to the possibility that this may be discussed in

Klan circles and especially be alert to the possibility of any use of

the above by klansmen.

(G) CONDUCT AND ACTIVITIES OF EMPLOYEES - DISCIPLINARY

MATTERS -- In the indoctrination of new employees following their

entry on duty, it is desired that more stress be placed upon the high

standards of conduct demanded by the Bureau of all of its personnel.

You must make certain that all new employees without exception are

advised of the high standards of personal behavior required of them,

and they should be strongly impressed with the fact that personal

misbehavior reflecting unfavorably upon them or the Bureau will not

be tolerated; further, that any such misconduct or allegation of it must

be promptly reported to the Bureau by any employee learning of it.

It is essential that you be meticulous in handling all matters

involving disciplinary action in order that the good name of the Bureau

may be protected and the rights of employees to firm but fair treatment

may be preserved. In this connection, your attention is called to the

provisions of Part I, Section 9 of the Manual of Rules and Regulations.

(H) EYEWITNESSES IN CRIMINAL CASES -- In connection with a

recent conviction for violation of the Federal Bank Robbery Statute,

defense counsel, subsequent to the trial, determined one of the

Government witnesses who claimed to be an eyewitness to the bank

robbery had falsely testified. Based on this disclosure the Agents

verified this witness had supplied false information to Bureau person-

nel during the investigation and had lied upon the witness stand.

This incident emphasizes the necessity for establishing the

validity of statements made by those who claim to have been eye-

witnesses to criminal activity. These individuals must be patiently

and thoroughly interviewed and if there is any reason to suspect the

truth of the information furnished, the matter must be pursued to

verify its authenticity. The Bureau cannot stress too strongly the

need for Bureau investigative personnel to be alert to the possibility

that those interviewed are furnishing false or speculative information.

(1) CUBAN REFUGEE MATTERS - INVESTIGATION TO DETECT

INTELLIGENCE AGENTS AMONG CUBAN REFUGEES -- SAC Letter

67-8 (F), January 31, 1967, expanded the procedure concerning the

investigation of Cuban refugees. It set forth in detail certain indicators

in the refugee's background which would form the basis for an active

investigation, outlined the investigation to be conducted, and indicated

you would be advised if changes were to be made in the procedure.

As a result of suggestions from the field and evaluation at

the Bureau, the following modifications and changes are to be placed

into effect immediately:

(1) Since the Miami Office reviews the backgrounds of all

refugees of possible interest to the Bureau entering the United States

at the Caribbean Admission Center, Opa Locka, Florida, and advises

the field of the identities of those refugees whose backgrounds con-

tain the indicators requiring investigation, other offices should not

independently initiate investigations of refugees who have recently

arrived unless some unusual factors exist or there is reason to believe

the refugee has intelligence or source potential.

(2) Indicator number 2 appearing in SAC Letter, which con-

cerned close relatives of refugees employed by the Cuban Government,

is not to be interpreted as referring to relatives who are low-level

employees unless they openly support the Castro government.

(3) Similarly, indicator number 6 which concerned employ-

ment of refugees by the Cuban Government is not to be interpreted as

referring to low-level employees. Cases are not to be opened on

refugees on the basis of such employment, in the absence of some other

indicator.

(4) Indicator number 7 which concerned involvement of a

refugee in communist, pro-Castro, or anti-United States activities is

to be interpreted as substantial indication of such involvement by refugee

since January, 1961, when the United States broke diplomatic relations

with Cuba.

(5) Indicator number 8 dealt with refugees of military age.

Military age is to be interpreted as applying to males from 15 to 27,

inclusive.

(6) A new indicator, number 9, has been added to those set

forth in the SAC Letter, i. e., refugees entering the United States

without relatives in this country.

(7) The SAC Letter required that check of New York files

and sources be made in each investigation. This check need no longer

be made unless information is obtained indicating New York might have

pertinent data.

Investigations to date have produced a wealth of intelligence

data and numerous sources who have been alerted to the FBI's

responsibility in the Cuban field. While these results are noteworthy,

our paramount objective is to detect intelligence agents being in-

filtrated into this country from Cuba. This is a difficult but not

insurmountable task. Success will depend largely on the ingenuity of

Agent personnel and the ability to detect inconsistencies in the refugee's

background, however small, which will signal the need for an intensified

investigation.

Since the majority of our refugee investigations culminate

in interviews, the ability to detect inconsistencies and the ingenuity

of the interviewing Agent are once more key factors. Careful

preparation and penetrative interviews aimed at determining the refugee's

present sympathies with respect to Castro and eliciting intelligence

data are necessary. Timely topics such as Castro's espousal of

Black Power-advocate Stokely Carmichael and avowed determination

to export revolution to all parts of this hemisphere, as well as

questions concerning the refugee's attitude towards the racial

situation, Soviet-Sino differences, and Soviet relations with Cuba,

could serve to indicate basic sympathies.

In certain instances where, after completion of the investi-

gation, it is felt that a recheck of sources and informants and reinterview

are warranted because of factors in the refugee's background and his

past activities, specifically advise the Bureau together With the con-

templated date of the proposed recheck: Reinterviews require Bureau

authority.

Because the Castro government has utilized Cuban refugees

as intelligence agents in the past, the continuing exodus of Cubans

presents Castro with a ready-made channel to infiltrate agents into

the United States. This has placed a heavy challenge at the Bureau's

doorstep which must be met. The success of the Cuban Refugee Program

will be assured in the final analysis by an ambitious, objective, and

imaginative approach to each case, and measured by accomplishments

such as the detection of Castro's agents, the development of current

intelligence data, and by an ever-growing list of valuable sources and

informants.

(A) AUTOMOBILES - OPERATION.OF -- Results of a recent study

concerning the hazards of driving on wet pavement have come to the

attention of the Bureau, and the following is being furnished to you to

bring to the attention of personnel in your office in an effort to reduce

accidents.

The survey shows that rain and slick pavement can be a

dangerous combination if speed is not reduced. In addition to normal

hazards of skidding, the phenomenon of "hydroplaning" can occur on

a wet road well within legal speed limits under certain adverse

pavement conditions when tires can ride on top of a thin layer of water

like water skis, losing all contact with the road surface. When these

conditions prevail, traction, steering, and braking may be reduced to

the vanishing point; and, a sharp turn in the road, heavy breaking, or

gusty side winds can cause loss of control. Tests of new tires inflated

at normal pressures "hydroplaned" at speeds of 60 miles per hour with

3/8 inch of water on smooth pavement and this can happen at lower

speeds if the tires are underinflated or bald. The survey also indicated

a necessity to be especially careful during the first few minutes of a rain

shower when road surface is liable to be extra slippery and dangerous,

particularly after a dry spell, as a thin film of greasy residue on the

pavement forms a treacherous lubricant until washed away by the rain.

The above should be borne in mind by all personnel driving

Bureau vehicles and during the monthly inspection of vehicles personnel

should insure all tires have sufficient tread and are properly inflated.

(C) TEAR GAS - MARK I TEAR GAS PROJECTOR AND MARK IV

CHEMICAL MACE -- A supply of Mark II T: ur Gas Projectors and Mark

IV Chemical Maces, manufactured by General Ordnance Equipment

Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, will soon be forwarded to all

field offices to be used by Special Agents working criminal cases where

physical resistance is encountered and in high-crime-rate neighborhoods

where bystanders might attempt to interfere with an arrest. Investigative

personnel should never rely on these devices to subdue assailants armed

with a potentially lethal weapon. They are intended for bringing under

control unarmed subjects who are physically opposing apprehension or

threatening to use a weapon from which Agents can reasonably avoid injury

in the event the chemical proves ineffective. Both the Mark Il Tear Gas

Projector, a fountain-pen-size, pocket device, and the Mark IV Chemical

Mace, which measures approximately 1 1/2 inches in diameter, contain

phenylchloromethylketone, a refined form of chloracetophenone (CN) and

a synergistic carrying material which immediately reacts on the oily-

fatty elements of the skin and attacks the sensitive nerve endings in the

impact area causing a stinging sensation; at the same time, vaporizing

of the tear gas element takes place and results in intense tearing of the

eyes. One or two one-second blasts from either of these devices directed

at the subject's face are almost instantly effective and the condition should

continue for approximately 15 to 30 minutes.

This authority for Special Agents to use these devices does

not change existing rules that the use of tear gas grenades or projectiles

must be authorized by the Special Agent in Charge. Both the Mark II

Projectors and the Mark IV Chemical Maces are serialized to assist in

recording the issue, and to control the use of the devices. To enable

the Bureau to properly evaluate the effectiveness of this equipment, in

every instance where either of the devices is used, a detailed memorandum

must be submitted to the Bureau, Attention: Training Division, describing

the conditions requiring the use and the results thereof.

This equipment should be retained in your gun vault and issued

to Agents, when needed, on a temporary charge-out basis, by serial number,

as is done with firearms and other raid materials. The devices must be

given the same security as other tear gas equipment.

Prior to the issuance of these devices to Special Agents, they

should be thoroughly trained in their use and to assist in this regard a

training bulletin and inert practice maces will be supplied in order that

Special Agents may be thoroughly familiar with them.

(F) CHINESE COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES IN U. S. RACIAL MATTERS

- As indicated in SAC Letter No. 65-46 (E), pronouncements of the

Chinese communist (Chicom) leadership, as well as government

broadcasts which emanated from Peking, clearly pointed out the desire

of the Chicom Government at that time to promote and abet racial strife

in this country. These efforts have continued and recently the Chicom

regime intensified its attempts to incite "Afro-Americans" to violence.

The Peking-published pamphlet recently introduced into the United

States which is signed by the fugitive, Robert F. Williams, a Negro

who fled this country to Cuba and then to Peking to escape a kidnapping

charge, is but a single example. This pamphlet gives tips on how to

sabotage urban facilities (sewer lines, electrical power stations and

highways) in the United States. In addition, the official Chicom news

organization, New China News Agency (NCNA), has concentrated for

several months on bombarding some 55 Negro newspapers in the United

States with daily NCNA releases, many of which extol the efforts of

racist extremists in this country and indicate a strong support of Negroes

in their "rebellion against racial oppression." Also, the Chicom daily

lewspaper, "People's Daily, " published in Peking, in its issue of August

2, 1967, in exhorting Negroes in this country to "destroy" those laws

which subject them to "enslavement and constant unemployment, " pointed

out, "Their rebellion is justified and they have done well, very well."

The Bureau considers the Chicoms' efforts to influence.

Negroes in this country to be an extreme threat to the internal security.

It is essential that every Agent handling security cases, particularly

those involved in Chinese and racial matters investigations, be made

aware of this threat. They should be instructed to be on the alert

constantly for information indicating Chicom attempts to influence

groups or individuals involved in the racial movement and it should

be emphasized that development of live informants who can become

knowledgeable of such attempts is vital. Promptly furnish any pertinent

information received.

In reviewing field nominations for the inclusion of names

in captioned Index, it has been noted that in some instances the Bureau

has never been furnished a report.

You should at this time review this Index and submit reports

in all instances in which reports have not previously been submitted.

In addition, all cases of individuals whose names are

included in this Index are to be brought up to date on an annual basis and

appropriate administrative ticklers should be set up to insure that such

within the past year should receive attention at this time.

Information developed regarding possible foreign travel

of an individual whose name is included in this Index should be handled

in the same fashion as security subjects traveling abroad with the

Bureau being promptly advised in order that appropriate agencies as

well as appropriate Legal Attaches may be kept informed of such travel.

In the event no pertinent information is developed during

(A) VOUCHER MATTER - BUREAU OF THE BUDGET CIRCULAR

A-56 DATED OCTOBER 12, 1966 - REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION

EXPENSES -- Section 4, Bureau of the Budget Circular A-56, dated

10/12/66, implements Public Law 89-516 as it relates to the allowances

for expenses incurred in connection with real estate transactions. The

regulations provide, in part, that upon a permanent change of official

duty station the Government will reimburse the employee for certain

expenses required to be paid by him in connection with the sale of one

residence at his old official station and/or the purchase of one dwelling

at his new official station.

In considering a voucher submitted to the United States

General Accounting Office (GAO) wherein a claim was made for the

forfeiture of earnest money put down as a deposit in connection with a

purchase of a home, the Comptroller General ruled that earnest money

forfeited because the transaction was not consummated is not proper for

reimbursement under Public Law 89-516 or implementing regulations.

The Comptroller General further ruled that money deposited in connection

with the purchase agreement did not in fact represent an expense and

therefore is not reimbursable even though the realty transaction is

completed.

In this test case the employee had incurred certain expenses

relative to the anticipated purchase and the Comptroller General ruled

that since the final purchase of the residence did not occur as a result

of the employee being retransferred in the interest of the Government,

the employee could be reimbursed for the items of expense incurred which

would have been reimbursable under the provisions of law and regulations

had the purchase transaction been completed.

In view of the fact that substantial losses can be sustained

in the forfeiture of earnest money relative to the purchase of a home and

inasmuch as such losses are not reimbursable under Government travel

regulations, employees who are officially transferred should be made

aware of this.

The Department of Justice advised on September 29,

found in which litigants have requested agency records under the Act

rather than seeking discovery under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Since it would be helpful to the attorneys of the Department of Justice

who are handling pending litigation to be advised of what information

is being sought by opposing parties or counsel, the Department requests

"... whenever your agency receives a request for records under the

Public Information Section of the Administrative Procedure Act from

a person (or his counsel) who is a party to litigation being handled by

the Department of Justice that the Justice Department attorney handling

the litigation be advised immediately. " Deny all requests for infor-

(D) CUBAN POTENTIAL FOR SABOTAGE AGAINST THE UNITED STATES -

Recent developments dictate that we institute additional safeguards to

neutralize the threat of Cuban-directed sabotage against U.S. installations

in this country and abroad. The vicious anti-U.S. resolutions adopted

at the Latin American Solidarity Organization (LASO) Conference in Havana

are already being implemented. Officials assigned at the Cuban Mission

to the United Nations (CMUN) are obtaining material for use in sabotaging

or otherwise penetrating Cuban refugee centers in the U. S. and soliciting

plans for armed attacks against the U. S. by Puerto Rican revolutionary

groups using guns and other war materials which would be provided by

the Cuban Government.

According to a deathbed statement by Alberto Bayo Giraud,

Fidel Castro's instructor and mentor in guerrilla tactics, Castro envisions

the use of American Negroes, Indians, and communists to methodically

sabotage and terrorize our installations throughout the Western Hemisphere.

When Cuban officials contacted Puerto Rican independence leaders on

September 11, 1967, they indicated heads of other revolutionary forces

in the New York City area would be offered arms and assistance also.

The following measures should be incorporated in your

overall coverage of Cuban-inspired sabotage and disruption: 1. During

your regularly scheduled contact of plant informants all are to be

specifically alerted to report the existence within their plants of dissident

groups, including "black nationalist" organizations, which have potential

for carrying out sabotage or other disruptive activities on behalf of Cuba.

2. During interviews of Cuban refugees under the program specified in

SAC Letters 67-8 and 67-52 they are to be pointedly questioned as to their

direct or indirect knowledge of sabotage plans being formulated against

this country. Cover this questioning when reporting the results of inter-

views with individual refugees. 3. On a selective basis your most

trustworthy police contacts are to be informed of the problem posed by

the possible use of minority groups in carrying out sabotage on behalf of

Cuba. These police officials should be confidentially requested to alert

their racial and security informants to provide any clues which would aid

in ferreting out potential saboteurs. 4. In your daily contacts with

cooperative and dependable security officials at department stores, super-

markets, and similar establishments employing sizeable labor forces,

they are to be alerted to our interest in being expeditiously advised of

data indicating groups or individuals within their organizations are

potential tools for use by Castro in subverting the U. S.

(E) W. E.B. DU BOIS CLUBS OF AMERICA - SUBVERSIVE ORGANI-

ZATION CHARACTERIZATION -- Set forth below is ar up-to-date

thumbnail sketch of the W. E.B. DuBois Clubs of America which replaces

the one set forth in SAC Letter 67-50. All sources utilized in the

preparation of this sketch can be described as furnishing reliable

information in the past.

W. E.B. DU BOIS CLUBS OF AMERICA (DCA)

A source advised that on October 26-27, 1963, a con-

ference of members of the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA), including

national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose of

setting in motion forces for the establishment of a new national Marxist-

oriented youth organization which would hunt for the most peaceful

transition to socialism. The delegates were told that it would be

reasonable to assume that the young socialists attracted into this new

organization would eventually pass into the CP itself.

A second source has advised that the founding convention

for the new youth organization was held from June 19-21, 1964, at 150

Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California, at which time the name

W. E.B. DuBois Clubs of America (DCA) was adopted. Approximately

500 delegates from throughout the United States attended this convention.

The second source advised in September, 1966, that

Mike Zagarell, CPUSA Youth Director, stated that in Negro communities

the Party still supported the plan to build "left" socialist centers and

to solidify the Party base through the DCA. This source also advised

in September, 1966, that Daniel Rubin, CPUSA National Organizational

Secretary, stated the Party believes the DCA should have a working-class

outlook and be a mass organization favorable to socialism, socialist

countries and Marxism, and in April, 1967, advised that Gus Hall,

CPUSA General Secretary, indicated the DCA primary emphasis should

be on developing mass resistance to the draft.

A third source advised in September, 1967, that Jarvis

Tyner was elected chairman of the DCA on September 10, 1967, at the

Third National Convention of the DCA held in New York, New York,

from September 8-10, 1967.

(G) RACIÁL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- In view of the in-

creasing problems with which we are faced in the racial field, particularly

in the development of racial intelligence concerning militant black

nationalist elements, a careful analysis of this matter has been made in

order to insure that proper emphasis is placed where needed. Also, in

order to afford better coordination over all interrelated racial security

matters (individuals and organizations) including the development of

racial informants, supervision is now being handled by the Racial

Intelligence Section of the Domestic Intelligence Division. For your

information, the Subversive Control Section is no longer in existence.

The investigation of the Communist Party and related matters other

than those with a racial aspect are being handled by the Internal Security

Section.

Our analysis of the racial informant program has shown

there is a definite need to develop additional penetrative coverage of the

militant black nationalist groups and the ghetto areas immediately to

be in a position to have maximum intelligence in anticipation of another

outburst of racial violence next summer.

In line with our objective, particular emphasis is being

placed on the development of ghetto-type racial informants. Individuals

to qualify as this type of informant must live or work in an area described

as a ghetto and, therefore, have access to pertinent racial information.

The steps necessary to qualify such an individual are as follows:

(1) The individual must have access to racial intelligence

information and must be willing to cooperate with the Bureau in furnish-

ing such information.

(2) In the absence of any derogatory information developed,

it will be necessary for you to check the following: field office indices,

FBI Identification Division records, and local credit and arrest records.

Of course, you must develop sufficient background data concerning each

prospective informant to allow an intelligent check of the foregoing

records to be made. As to the method of recommending to the Bureau

that an individual be approved as a racial informant (ghetto-type), be

guided by the instructions set out in Section 130, Volume IV, Manual

of Instructions, concerning probationary racial informants.

All individuals recommended and approved as ghetto-type

racial informants will be considered probationary racial informants

with the word "ghetto" after the informant's name or symbol. An

example of this is "John Jones, Probationary Racial Informant (Ghetto)"

or "NY 1234-R (PROB - Ghetto). "

Agents handling these ghetto-type probationary racial inform-

ants must be constantly alert for any indications of character traits or

activities of these informants which might cause embarrassment to the

Bureau. In addition, the information furnished by these informants

should not be taken at face value. A diligent attempt must be made

to verify all information furnished by these informants through other

sources and/or investigation.

In addition, immediately review all security informant files

for the purpose of determining which security informants are solely or

predominantly active in the racial field. Examples would be individuals

furnishing information concerning the Minutemen, as well as the Nation

of Islam, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Congress of

Racial Equality, and other militant black nationalist-type groups. The

security designation of these informants should be changed to the

appropriate racial informant designation. For example, a potential

security informant should be made a probationary racial informant and

a security informant should be designated as a racial informant. There-

after, they should be operated principally in the racial field and super-

vised by the Racial Informant Desk. When an informant is changed from

a security informant to a racial informant, the field classilication

number should be changed to a 170 classification. Advise the Bureau

promptly as to which security informants are being converted to racial

informants.

In addition, each office having a Black Nationalist Groups

TOPLEV Informant Program is to immediately assign at least one

get we clustel the one or mant ide this Prosam

three-month period appropriate observations as to the success of the

Program and recommendations as to its continuance.

As I have advised in the past, it is imperative and essential

that the Bureau learn of any indications of advance planning or organized

conspiracy on the part of individuals or organizations in connection

with riots and racial disturbances.

You are again reminded that

informants should be alerted and directed to obtain information con-

cerning individuals who may be stockpiling firebombs, Molotov cocktails,

weapons, and to identify any groups of terrorists who may be planning

on carrying out a type of guerrilla warfare during riotous situations.

I expect each office to give this most important matter

priority attention in order to achieve our goal during the next six

months. Your efforts and results will be followed closely at the Bureau

and during field Inspections. Appropriate Manual changes will be

forthcoming.

and classified on computer equipment. The classification is broadly

based on (1) Physical description, (2) Modus operandi, and (3) Make-up

and form of the fraudulent checks.

Information for the file is furnished

by the field on Form FD-390 (pertaining to description and modus

operandi) and by the Laboratory on Form 7-112 (pertaining to make-up

and form of the subject's checks).

Searches of available information in unknown subject cases

can be made rapidly against PROCHEK, looking toward the identification

of the unknown subject. (Photographs of checks in the files of suspects

suggested by the computer will be compared in the Laboratory with

the current "unsub" checks in question.

Any "identifications" made

will be the result of a document examination rather than the computer's

selection of suspects.) At the present time such searches will be made

automatically in cases where it is deemed logical by the Laboratory

without specific request from the field.

It is essential that all Agents be thoroughly familiar with

PROCHEK and the proper completion of Form FD-390 in appropriate

cases. Only bona fide professional check passers will be included in

PROCHEK, (See reBulet to Albany for detailed criteria and procedures.)

The "overall picture" of a known individual's activities should be

described on Form FD-390, carefully and accurately, when such

individual meets the criteria for inclusion in PROCHEK. Form FD-390

can be filled out in longhand. Only one copy is necessary in the Bureau.

In order to further compile information on current pro-

files for the past six months and complete Form FD-390, where

appropriate, on individuals not already recommended for PROCHEK.

(D) FUGITIVE MATTERS - REPORTING APPREHENSION OR DIS-

MISSAL OF PROCESS - NATIONAL CRIME INFORMATION CENTER

(NCIC) - WANTED PERSONS FILE -- In order to expedite routing to

NCIC of communications to the Bureau reporting apprehension or dis-

missal of process of a Bureau fugitive, the following procedures are to

be placed in effect immediately.

Where airtels are submitted notifying the Bureau of the appre-

hension of a fugitive or dismissal of process, an additional copy should be

- prepared. The copy count should reflect one copy for NCIC (1 - NCIC).

In those instances where notification is by teletype to the

Bureau, such teletypes should be directed to TWX 710-822-9449. The

title in these teletypes should contain the abbreviation "NCIC" immediately

following the substantive character. For example, "JOHN DOE - FUG.,

BR - NCIC." This will indicate to employees transmitting these teletypes

that TWX 710-822-9449 should be dialed when sending the teletype. The

above procedures relating to submission of airtels or teletypes will not

be necessary for those offices which have NCIC terminal facilities for

entering data into NCIC. Cancellation or clearance of persons no longer

wanted as fugitives will be effected immediately by these offices.

The New York and Newark offices (and the Baltimore and

Philadelphia offices when connected to a leased teletype circuit), prior

to transmitting teletypes of the type designated above, will activate the

paper tape reperforator at the receiving teletype terminal at the Bureau.

The caption should contain "NCIC" following the substantive character

of the case.

Existing instructions relating to submission of Form. FD-220

in deserter fugitive cases are not changed.

These procedures concern only the method of furnishing

notification of apprehension or dismissal of process of fugitives and

do not alter the existing instructions as to when airtels or teletypes

should be used.

(E) VISITORS TO COMMUNIST-BLOC COUNTRIES. (COMBLOC) --

An analysis of the Bureau's double-agent operations as well as mounting

evidence from defectors shows continuing aggressive attempts by com-

munist-bloc intelligence services to recruit intelligence agents from

among travelers to the communist bloc. In the satellite field approximately

50 percent of our double agents have visited a satellite country and were

recruited either prior to, during, or subsequent to their visit. While

not all of these double agents have been developed as a result of our

interviews based on their visits, the fact that so many of these agents

were recruited or trained on communist-bloc soil is a strong indicator

as to where we should attempt to uncover intelligence agents. We also

know that illegal agents have made return trips to the bloc countries for

apparent "home leave" and/or "retraining" purposes.

The Romanian and Hungarian intelligence services have been

active in such recruitments during 1967. In all of the satellite fields we

have examples of such recruitments in other years. The security with

which such persons can be approached on communist-bloc soil is obvious.

The recruitments have included individuals in the scientific and technical

fields; those active in ethnic groups; airline employees; lawyers; a

warehouseman, a bar hostess and a production engineer. Persons of

both sexes and those ranging in age from the early 20's to the age of 60

have been recruited.

Although approaches in most instances have been

made on the first visit to the bloc country, there are also examples where

approaches have not been made until after numerous visits.

A review of current cases at the Bureau indicates the field

should more fully exploit the counterintelligence potential in this area

of our work. Although the Bureau has instructed such visitors should

be interviewed with a minimum amount of investigation and on a highly

selective basis, this should not be construed as eliminating all such

interviews. Because of the importance the communist-bloc places on

recruitment of such visitors, the Bureau desires each office consider

interviewing some visitors to each of the satellite countries and

Yugoslavia during the next six months. This will provide the Bureau

with the opportunity to uncover any recruited agents and to provide a

representative selection of cases from which the Bureau can determine

the extent to which we should exploit this counter-intelligence potential.

Each field office should review its control file maintained in

accordance with Manual of Instructions,

Section 105G, and should send

the Bureau under the respective country's caption the identities of such

aliens listed in the control file which have been provided by INS since

January 1, 1967, and identities of other visitors of whom you are aware.

This should be submitted to the Bureau within 30 days of the date of this

letter. Reevaluate the possibilities previously rejected and consider an

additional number of those for interview. Indicate by an asterisk which

persons you now intend to consider for interview and, of course, open

separate cases on those individuals. In those instances where offices

cannot develop a sufficient number of persons visiting specific bloc

countries, the Bureau will consider furnishing each office with identities

of additional travelers to those countries to consider them for interview.

While we desire to interview additional visitors, the Bureau will care-

fully control the number of such persons interviewed.

Interviews should be conducted with an absolute minimum

of investigative effort as noted in the Manual of Instructions. The inter-

view should be sufficiently searching to elicit information from the visitor

which would have a bearing on the internal security of the United States.

Perseverance and attention to pertinent details have been key factors

in eliciting data regarding recruitment approaches.

Six months after the date of this letter each field office must

submit a statistical tabulation itemized under separate country headings.

This should show:

(1) The number of individuals known to that office

to have visited each specific country;

(2) The number of such individuals considered for

interview by the office;

(3) The number actually interviewed;

(4) Summary data (in one or two sentences) and identities

of individuals covering those instances where:

(a) Individual was compromised, approached

and/or recruited by a communist-bloc

intelligence service;

interviews;

(c) Positive intelligence information was produced

for dissemination to other U. S. Government

agencies;

(d) You developed sources or informants among

ethnic groups, or in the various nationality

fields as a result of the interviews.

Within the limits of current manpower, each SAC must make

certain that a reasonable number of visitors to each of the communist

countries enumerated are considered for interview to be certain we make

additional efforts to uncover individuals compromised, approached and

recruited by the communist-bloc intelligence services in each of the

countries. The countries to be included are Albania, Bulgaria,

Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Mongolia, Poland

and Romania.

All cases opened in accordance with the above instructions

and only such cases opened during the next six months under these

criteria, should contain the code word (Combloc), in parentheses, in

the caption of each intra-Bureau communication following the character

in the title of each case.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

November 7, 1967

(A) BUREAU AUTOMOBILES AS EMERGENCY VEHICLES -- A

recent Maryland court ruling held that FBI vehicles are not duly

authorized emergency vehicles under existing Maryland State Motor

Vehicle Laws. In this case the Bureau car had been operating

under emergency conditions with use of siren and flashing red

light as required. A Special Assistant Attorney General of Maryland

expressed the opinion that a vehicle of the FBI responding to an

alarm at the site of a bank robbery and being charged with the

preservation of public order and the prevention and detection of

crime falls within the classification of police vehicle as described

in the statute, and that when so designated by the Commissioner,

Department of Motor Vehicles, such vehicles are entitled to the

benefits of applicable statutory provisions. The Department of

Motor Vehicles suggests that in the future the FBI consider making

a formal application in writing when it wishes such vehicles

designated as authorized emergency vehicles.

You should immediately ascertain if FBI vehicles are

classified as emergency vehicles within your Division, when

operated by a Bureau employee on official business and in

compliance with statutory requirements as to warning devices.

Advise Bureau, citing the authority, and if a question exists

concerning status as emergency vehicles, submit your observations

and recommendations. The required warning devices should also

be ascertained and reported. In those instances when more than

one office is located within a state, the office covering the state

capital should make the above determination and designate copies

of letter to Bureau for the other offices within that state.

(B) SEARCHES AND SEIZURES -- Five copies of a pamphlet entitled

"Search of Premises by Consent" are being sent separately to each field

office. Offices needing additional copies may request them. Law

enforcement officers needing individual copies, or a small number, for

instruction purposes may obtain them by writing to the Bureau. The

pamphlet is not available, however, for distribution to all students in

police schools other than the FBI National Academy classes.

This pamphlet is for the particular attention and use of the

Legal Instructor

• in your office. It should be readily available, however,

to all investigative personnel. Since it does not mention Bureau policy

and contains no classified information, no custodial safeguards are necessary.

Legal Instructors should continue to emphasize the desirability

of making searches by search warrant as much as possible. Search by

consent remains what it always has been - a secondary way of searching,

to be used when the officer believes that a search should be made and

there is no other legal basis on which to make it. "Our Constitution

envisions that searches will ordinarily follow procurement by police of

a valid search warrant. " Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294, 310 (1967).

Searches by consent should be preceded by execution of the

Bureau'

s consent to search form which advises the subject of his

constitutional right to refuse such a search. Use of this form is now

more necessary than ever because of the position recently taken by some

courts that the consent to search is not voluntarily given unless it was

preceded by a warning of the constitutional right to refuse consent. See

U.S. v. Nikrasch, 367 F2d 740 (1966) and U.S. v. Blalock, 255 F. Supp.

268 (1966); Contra, Gorman v. U.S., 380 F2d 158 (1967).

If the subject signs the consent to search form after he has

read it or, alternatively, it has been read to him, you may assume that a

valid consent has been given. If he orally expresses his willingness to

consent to a search but adds that he will not sign anything, record those

facts on the face of the form, witness the form, and proceed with the

search to which oral consent was given. The form executed in this manner

has evidentiary value. Wong Sun v. U.S, 371 U. S. 471, 491 (1963). See

also U.S. v. Hecht, 259 F. Supp. 581 (1966). Searches on oral consent

after refusal to sign a written waiver have been upheld. U.S. v. Hecht,

supra; Burge v. U.S., 342 F2d 408 (1965); U.S. v. Friedman, 166 F. Supp.

786 (1958).

(E) CRIMINAL FRAUD INVESTIGATIONS - Ever-increasing amounts

of Federal moneys are being expended by Government agencies for the

procurement of goods and services in connection with national defense,

the space program and the administration of the Government; for the

funding of various programs dealing with poverty, highway construction,

education and training, unemployment, etc.; and for the payment of

numerous benefits to veterans. In addition, the Government extensively

insures loans granted in connection with programs administered by the

Federal Housing Administration, Veterans Administration, and the Small

• Business Administration.

Although the amount of Government spending and the over-

all population have been increasing steadily, the case loads and accomplish-

ments in Criminal Fraud Matters have not increased proportionately.

Accomplishments are obviously related to case load trends and it is

incumbent upon the field and the Seat of Government to see that all fraud

violations are promptly referred, vigorously investigated, and closely

followed with United States Attorneys and/or the Department of Justice,

when necessary, for early prosecutive disposition.

Complete reliance cannot be placed upon Government

agencies to refer allegations of violations. Others must be made aware

of our jurisdiction in Criminal Fraud Matters. Not to be overlooked

are the value of criminal informants and the development of new informants

in the field of Criminal Fraud Matters. In addition, as a result of the

loan insurance programs in connection with housing, the Government has

been forced to take ownership of considerable individual and multiple

housing units due to defaults on initial loans. The possibility of fraud in

connection with the repair thereof and resale thereof is obvious.

Each Special Agent in Charge is to personally review the

handling of Criminal Fraud Matters in his office. This will include the

investigative attention afforded such matters; the various programs in

existence dealing with the referral by various Government agencies,

private businesses, private citizens, sources and contacts; and the

handling of completed investigations with United States Attorneys looking

toward early prosecutive disposition of such matters. The Bureau is to

be advised within thirty days as to the results of that review and is to be

advised as to what programs, techniques, and devices other than the usual

liaison contacts have been instituted to reverse the declining trend in the

number of criminal fraud cases.

(F) FOREIGN INFLUENCES IN THE BLACK NATIONALIST

MOVEMENT - RACIAL MATTERS -- In certain specific instances

in the past the Bureau has alerted you to the present potential which

exists for foreign influences in this country in connection with certain

Black Nationalist Movements and has instructed that the Bureau be

promptly notified of any information developed along these lines. At

this time I desire to reiterate and amplify existing instructions.

In connection with our intelligence-gathering activities

involving racial disturbances and the investigative activities of

militant black nationalist individuals and organizations, we must be

ever alert for the existence of evidence of foreign direction of racial

disturbances or foreign influences in the Black Nationalist Movement -

and we must do everything possible to be certain that all allegations

of such are fully explored.

The potential for foreign influences in these matters

certainly exists as evidenced by wide travel in communist countries

of such militant black nationalists as Stokely Carmichael who, within

the recent past, has visited such far-flung places as Cuba, North

Vietnam, Czechoslovakia, Algeria, United Arab Republic, and other

countries abroad. Other individuals connected with the Student

Nonviolent Coordinating Committee as well as individuals affiliated

with other black nationalist organizations are known to have traveled

in communist countries.

Each office should review its files for the identities of any

known black nationalists who have traveled to Iron Curtain countries

and other communist countries during the past two years. The files

should thereafter be thoroughly analyzed and in instances in which

investigations have not been conducted, penetrative investigations

should be initiated at this time looking toward developing any

information regarding contacts on the part of these individuals with

foreign elements and looking toward developing any additional information

having a bearing upon whether the individual involved is currently

subjected to foreign influence or direction. Pending files and files on

those previously investigated following such travel should be thoroughly

analyzed at this time looking toward determining whether further

investigation should be conducted along the above lines.

During your investigative coverage of all militant black

nationalists, be most alert to any foreign travel.. Advise the Bureau

promptly of such in order that appropriate overseas investigations

may be conducted to establish activities and contacts abroad.

In addition, each office should submit a letterhead

memorandum with the above caption within 30 days setting forth all

information contained therein having a bearing upon this matter. The

information is to include indications of foreign support, direction,

guidance or influence, as well as a listing of individual black

nationalists residing in the territory covered by your office who have

traveled to communist countries within the past two years. Each

office should open a control file captioned as above to which should be

directed copies of all information developed along these lines.

A control file has been established at the Bureau with the

above caption. Bureau file FILE *

The semimonthly memorandum entitled "Possible Racial

Violence, Major Urban Areas" submitted for the purpose of keeping

the Bureau and interested agencies apprised of the potential for

violence in the United States should set forth any pertinent data

developed on a current basis concerning foreign influence in these

matters. When you have information to be reported in this regard

it should be set forth under the caption of this SAC Letter.

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

• November 28, 1967

(A) ARREST: SEARCH AND SEIZURE -- Current developments in the law

dictate that special care be taken in preparing complaints for arrest war-

rants and affidavits for search warrants in order to make certain that

each states the essential facts of probable cause rather than a merely

conclusory allegation of guilt. A conclusory allegation alone is worthless

and makes the warrant invalid. See Rules 3 and 41, Federal Rules of

Criminal Procedure, SAC Letters 58-44 (B), 58-49 (F), 58-60 (G),

58-80 (D), 66-19 (E), 66-41 (A) and the court decisions cited below.

The need for particular care in preparing complaints and

warrants results, in part, from recent changes in the law which make

counsel more readily available to the accused, and the growing inclination

of defense counsel to fight the case at every stage. As predicted recently

by Judge J. Edward Lumbard, Chief Judge, United States Court of Appeals,

Second Circuit, "There will be more motions . . . fewer pleas of guilty . ..

more appeals." The prosecution now must do a better job because

". . . the opposition will be more alert and ready to take advantage of

faulty presentation." An insufficient complaint or affidavit resulting in

an invalid warrant is "faulty presentation," particularly vulnerable to

defense attack.

The Legal Instructor in your office should be directed to

review complaints and affidavits which are to be filed by other investigative

personnel. This review will indicate what additional action, if any, is

necessary. Offices for which the United States Attorney or an Assistant

reviews the actual language of all complaints and affidavits may find that

such documents are in proper form. Other offices may find inadequacies.

In the latter case, the Legal Instructor must immediately instruct investi-

gative personnel in the preparation of complaints and affidavits and continue

his review of those being filed.

In the great majority of criminal cases, the filing of a proper

complaint or affidavit is a simple skill, easily learned. The basic technique

is that of relating the essential facts of probable cause in the "Who? What?

When? Where? and Why?" manner of a good newspaper story. This can be

done, usually, in very brief form, as demonstrated by some of the decisions

cited below, most of which contain the full text or a good summary of a

gh1l79

(B) VOUCHER MATTER - EFFECTIVE DATE OF AN OFFICIAL

TRANSFER -- There appears to be some misunderstanding among Bureau

employees concerning what determines the "effective date" of an official

transfer.

Bureau of the Budget Circular Number A-56 dated October 12,

1966, copies of which have been previously furnished your office, clearly

defines this term to be the date the employee reports for duty at his new

official station. You are also reminded that the language used in official

transfer letters shows that the employees' headquarters are being

changed effective upon the employees' arrival at the new station. The

"effective date" of a transfer must be considered in determining reimburse-

ment of certain expenses incurred by transterred employees and in con-

nection with the service agreement which the employee is required to enter

into when officially transferred. In view of this, the matter should be

discussed with all employees of your office to insure there is no misunder-

standing of what actually constitutes the effective date of a transfer.

Appropriate changes are being made for the Manual of Rules •

and Regulations, Official Transfer Letter, Form 3-34 and the Written

Agreement Forms FD-382 and 3-34b.

(C) AUTOMOBILES - USE OF SEAT BELTS -- In a recent Federal Tort

Claims Act case, the District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi

reduced a damage award in half based upon the Court's finding that the

plaintiff's failure to have fastened an available seat belt was negligence

and a 50 per cent contributing cause of the injuries sustained. Depart-

ment of Justice has advised U. S. Attorneys that although the decision

represents an application of the comparative negligence law of Mississippi

there may be a growing disposition on the part of courts generally to

treat the failure to utilize seat belts as contributory negligence or as a

basis for reducing a damage award where failure is causally related to

injuries complained of. U. S. Attorneys were instructed to consider

this fact as a defensive mechanism in settlement negotiations and at

trials.

SAC Letter 57-55 of October 1, 1957, advised you the use

of seat belts is strictly voluntary but that you should continue to advise

Bureau of instances where the severity of injury was directly related

to the use or nonuse of seat belts. In view of recent thinking, as indicated

in the aforementioned decision, Bureau desires to reiterate the foregoing

instruction and urges that seat belts be fastened where applicable. In

connection with Bureau automobile accidents effective at once prompt

efforts should be made to determine if third party and/or passengers

had their seat belts fastened at the time of the accident. The results

of such inquiry should henceforth be incorporated into reports covering

Bureau automobile accidents. Such inquiries should also be made in the

Bureau's investigations of any motor vehicle collision case under the

Federal Tort Claims Act.

(D) IMPREST FUNDS - AUDIT AS OF DECEMBER 29, 1967 -- Treasury

Department regulations require that at the close of the period covered by

a surety bond on Imprest Fund Cashiers, the cash in the hands of Cashiers

or Alternate Cashiers be verified by two disinterested persons, designated

for this purpose by the Special Agent in Charge, and that a report of the

same be submitted to the Chief Disbursing Officer of the Treasury

Department.

The surety bond presently covering our Cashiers and Alternate

Cashiers was originally executed for a two-year period, which will expire

at the close of business, December 31, 1967. Accordingly, it will be

necessary for you to designate two disinterested employees to audit the

Imprest Fund of your office on December 29, 1967, since December 31,

1967, is on Sunday. Form FD-301 should be executed in an original and

two copies and signed by the individuals making the audit. The original

and one copy should be forwarded to the Bureau, attention "Budget Unit."

This audit cannot be made on any other day, nor can one of the semi-

annual audits be used for the purpose. You are not to interpret this as

eliminating or superseding either of the semiannual audits. This is an

audit which must be made every two years in addition to any other audits

that are required to be made. The original of this audit report will

have to be forwarded to a different branch of the Treasury Department

than that to which the regular semiannual reports are sent. Also, it is

desired to stress that both of the individuals making the audit must sign

the report.

(E) RABBLE ROUSER INDEX -- Section 122E of the Manual of Instructions

sets forth instructions regarding the Rabble Rouser Index being maintained

at the Bureau and in the field. In view of the growing problems created by

local rabble rousers from the standpoint of internal security, the criteria

for recommending individuals to be included in the Rabble Rouser Index

is being expanded. Henceforth, the criteria for inclusion will be

(1) agitators who have demonstrated by their actions and speeches that

they have a propensity for fomenting disorder of a racial and/or security

nature and (2) have attracted such attention, nationally or locally, as to be

of significant interest with regard to the overall civil disturbance picture.

A rabble rouser is defined as a person who tries to arouse

people to violent action by appealing to their emotions, prejudices, et

cetera; a demagogue.

You will note that under prior criteria the Rabble Rouser

Index served as an index only for individuals of national prominence with

particular consideration given to those who travel extensively and was

limited to those fomenting racial disorder. It is the intent of this expanded

criteria to have within each division as well as nationwide an index of

agitators of all types whose activities have a bearing on the national

security. This would include, for example, black nationalists, white

supremacists, Puerto Rican nationalists, anti-Vietnam demonstration

leaders, and other extremists. As you were previously advised, the

fact that the individual is on the Security Index or the Reserve Index does

not preclude his inclusion on the Rabble Rouser Index.

Each Special Agent in Charge is instructed to submit a letter

under the above caption to the Bureau within 30 days from the date of this

letter setting forth the identities of the individuals residing within the

field divisions who are being recommended for inclusion on the Rabble

Rouser Index under the expanded criteria. In accordance with existing

instructions, an original and four copies of a separate write-up should

be submitted regarding each individual recommended using the sample

format previously furnished to you.

(F) EAST-WEST EXCHANGE PROGRAM (SATELLITE COUNTRIES) --

The increasing volume of visitors to the United States from the satellite

countries under the East-West Exchange Program (EWEP) and the

freedom of travel permitted these visitors throughout the United States

warrant a change in our present limited coverage. In an effort to more

effectively utilize manpower in more productive fields, such as visitors

to communist-bloc countries, it appears necessary to streamline the

limited coverage presently being afforded each satellite exchange visitor

and to investigate only those exchange visitors on whom there is infor-

mation indicating an intelligence background or indication that the visitor

will engage in intelligence activity in the United States.

Established sources who have been developed over the past

years in connection with the exchange program and who are aware of the

Bureau's responsibilities in the internal security field can be expected

to furnish field offices with significant information coming to their

attention indicating an exchange visitor may be acting in an intelligence

capacity. Such information received by the field concerning a satellite

exchange visitor should be submitted to the Bureau in letterhead memo-

randum form suitable for dissemination and, if warranted, will serve

as a basis for the Bureau's requesting Department of State clearance

to initiate an active investigation of the exchangee.

The following procedures concerning the coverage of

visitors from satellite countries to the United States under the EWEP

are to be placed into efiect immediately:

In the absence of information indicating an intelligence back-

ground or indication that the visitor will engage in intelligence activity

in the United States, no coverage should be afforded exchange visitors or

groups regardless of the duration of stay in the United States. The above

also applies to students who enter the United States with an F visa, com-

mercial trainees, entertainers, and individuals entering the United

States with H visas.

In the absence of significant intelligence data, forms now

received by the Bureau regarding exchange visitors such as Department

of State name check requests and telegrams will be furnished to

interested field offices for informative purposes only and no inquiry

SAC LETTER 67-70

should be initiated upon receipt thereof. The names of individual visitors

should be indexed by the office where destined and the forms filed in a

suitable control file. No copies of the forms will be retained at the Seat

of Government. If positive intelligence data develops through the Bureau's

name check procedures, appropriate instructions will be issued the field.

Information received by a field office from any source

indicating an exchange visitor from a satellite country is acting in an

intelligence capacity should be submitted to the Bureau by the most

expeditious means warranted together with the office's evaluation and

recommendation for additional coverage or investigation. Significant

intelligence information and/or derogatory information of a nonintelligence

nature should be submitted to the Bureau in letterhead memorandum

form suitable for dissemination. Nonderogatory information received

concerning these visitors need not be reported to the Bureau. Letterhead

memoranda prepared for dissemination should be appropriately classified

since unauthorized disclosure of the Bureau's interest in a participant

in an official exchange could be detrimental to the defense interests of

the Nation. An evaluation memorandum, if prepared, should be

appropriately classified for the same reason.

If an investigation is initiated, it should be conducted in the

same manner as an investigation of a Soviet exchange visitor (see Section

105K, 6a, (9) (c.?, page 21a).

Upon receipt of this letter a review should be made by the

office of origin of all pending cases concerning satellite exchange

visitors and the Bureau advised under the individual case caption of

each case which will be retained in a pending status and the reasons

therefor, taking into consideration the above criteria. Those cases not

fitting within the above criteria should be closed administratively without

notification to the Bureau.

Appropriate manual revisions are forthcoming.

(G) VISITORS TO NORTH VIETNAM AND CONTACT WITH NORTH

VIETNAMESE ESTABLISHMENTS ABROAD -- Extremists, dissenters,

and procommunists in numerous fields are engaging in a concerted

effort to influence United States citizenry by criticizing United States

political and military involvement in Vietnam. An increasing number

of persons from these type groups are visiting North Vietnam without

State Department approval and have been in contact with North Vietnamese

establishments abroad.

In October, 1967, Radio Hanoi (North Vietnam) announced

the formation of South Vietnamese People's Committee for Solidarity with

the American People by the National Liberation Front (political arm of

the Viet Cong) with the objective of establishing relations and contacts

with "progressive organizations and individuals in the United States

struggling for peace, justice, freedom, democracy, and civil rights."

In view of expressed objective of North Vietnam in its radio broadcast,

United States visitors to North Vietnam would be excellent targets for

recruitment by the North Vietnamese for propaganda and/or subversive

purposes.

Accordingly, investigations of United States citizens and

resident aliens visiting North Vietnam and contacting North Vietnamese

establishments abroad should be handled in contormance with instructions •

set forth in Section 105F5 of the Manual of Instructions relating to persons

visiting Communist China and/or contacting Chinese Communist estab-

lishments. It is absolutely essential that these cases receive thorough

investigative attention.

(B) EAST-WEST EXCHANGE PROGRAM - NATIONAL COUNCIL OF

AMERICAN-SOVIET FRIENDSHIP - INTERNAL SECURITY - RUSSIA --

Information has been furnished to the Bureau by the Department of

State that the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship (NCASF)

is attempting to arrange exchanges of undergraduate students with

the USSR. As you are aware, the NCASF is an organization whose

function is to promote a friendly relationship and cultural exchange

between the United States and the Soviet Union and it has been designated

by the Attorney General pursuant to Executive Order 10450.

The Department of State advised that in 1966 contacts were

made by representatives of the NCASE with Carleton College and St.

Olaf's College in Northfield, Minnesota, proposing that some of the

colleges' undergraduates participate in exchanges with Soviet youth.

The Department of State also advised that in 1967, a

representative of the NCASF approached Antioch College, Yellow

Springs, Ohio, about establishing an exchange relationship with Soviet

organizations.

Recently an article appeared in a campus newspaper

reporting a proposal by the NCASF to exchange undergraduates by

American and Soviet higher schools. It was reported that NCASF

had communicated with 120 American colleges and universities of

which 12 or 13 were said to be interested in the exchange proposal.

You should be alert to any information coming to your

attention through established sources or public media concerning

NCASE efforts to negotiate privately for such exchanges. Be alert

to any Soviet pressure, particularly from the Soviet Embassy, to

manipulate an agreement outside the U.S. -USSR exchanges framework.

No active investigation should be conducted to develop this information

and you are to be guided by instructions previously furnished

concerning contacts at colleges and universities. Any information

received should be immediately brought to the attention of the Bureau

in letterhead memorandum (LHM) form.

(C) SOVIET NONOFFICIAL VISITORS WHO COME INDIVIDUALLY

TO THE UNITED STATES - INTERNAL SECURITY - RUSSIA - By

SAC Letter 67-38, dated June 27, 1967, you were advised that Soviet .

citizens who come into the United States for the purpose of visiting

friends or relatives would be required to advise the nearest Immigration

and Naturalization Service (INS) Office of their intention to travel beyond

a 25-mile limit. This was a change from previous instructions which

required these individual Soviets to obtain State Department approval

• prior to such travel.

You were advised that when INS formulated its plan, you

would be advised as to what records would be maintained.

...

INS has now informed the Bureau that when the Soviet visitors

advise INS of their intention to travel beyond the 25-mile limit, INs will

furnish the information to the nearest office of the FBI, but INS will not

maintain any records whatsoever concerning this travel.

As you were previously advised, instructions in Section 105E

of the Manual of Instructions pertain to the investigative coverage of

individuals of this type. As previously instructed, it will not be necessary

to advise the Bureau on an individual basis when information of such travel

is furnished to your office by INS. You should, however, insure that this

information is furnished to the office covering the travel of the Soviet so

that the individual to whom the Soviet is destined may be appropriately

identified and his employment obtained in accordance with the above •

SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL POLICE

This slogan, 'support your local police', originated with the

Minutemen organization

and has been widely copied by other patriotic

organizations.

Some people who read this slogan assume that we mean citizens

should support their local police forces in their fight against crime, riots,

etc. This is only part of it. Our slogan "support your local police', has

a much greater significance.

Throughout history, dictatorships of all types have found it

helpful to maintain powerful national police agencies (for example the

gestapo, GPU, NKVD, etc.) to maintain control over thei: own people

Even in the most brazen dictatorships such organizations always pretend

to their own citizens that they are 'fighting crime' and 'protecting the

security of the country'. Their true purpose of course, is to destroy anyone

who objects to the regime in power or who might pose a possible threat

to the continued rule of the dictator.

As the communists have taken over several other countries in the

past,

they have used riots and propaganda campaigns charging police

brutality as a means of (first) reducing the effectiveness of local police

forces and (second) of creating or expanding national police agencies

that are fully controlled by the central government. This same familiar

pattern is now taking place here in the United States.

The "President's

commission on crime' has recommended the

formation of a gigantic "national' police force, expanding the FBI, ATTU

and the creation of a special 'anti-riot' task force of federal agents.

Those who are familiar with the traditional pattern of communist

conquest from within view these steps with alarm. We predict that once

this great federal police power exists it will be used seldom, if ever, for

its supposed purpose. Instead, it will be used by hidden communists with-

in our own federal bureaucracy to harass loyal citizens that try to stem the

continued growth of the socialistic dictatorial bureaucracy within our own

nation.

One way that the average citizen can help prevent this tragedy

is to provide adequate tax revenues at the local level to finance efficient

city, county and state police forces. It is far better to support adequately

paid, trained and equipped local police forces than to encourage further

growth of federal bureaucratic power.

The ultimate responsibility of your local police force is the de

fense and protection of the citizens within its jurisdiction. It must not be

weakened by federal controls or financially dependent on federal support.

The continued freedom of our nation depends on the continued

freedom of your local police officer. He deserves your friendly and cour-

teous support in every way possible.

Dear Fellow American:

•Various agencies of the federal government act as is

they alone were responsible for combating this danger but at the

same time, they practically deny that such a danger exists. When

it comes to protecting our nation from communist infiltration and

ossible future sabotage, these federal agencies do nothing at ail

•to assist or encourage local police action.

our organization has assembled data on some 75,000 in-

dividuals that either belong to the communist party or various

subversive front groups.

There was a time when we turned such information over to

the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Experience has shown that

we might as well have thrown it in the wastebasket.

Powerful in-

Iluences high up in our rederal government are working to protect

these communist traitors from public exposure or legal prosecution.

We realize that local law enforcement agencies are great-y

hanaicapped so far as any effort they might mäke along these lires.

Still there may be some local police officials who could profit by

knowing the identity of communist subversives in their areas.

We are now prepared to provide these lists on request

to local law enforcement agencies.

(F) RACIAL INIFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- The legacy of hate

Our experience has shown that the Klan has attempted in

In light of our stepped-up program of developing racial

informants in militant black nationalist groups, it is logical to assume

that these groups may also attempt to penetrate our informant ranks.

In view of the above, we must never close our eyes to the possibility

of being infiltrated.

In addition, we must insure that all interviews

with prospective racial informants are exhaustive and designed to

uncover any information bearing on the individual's suitability as an

informant.

(A) IDENTIFICATION MATTERS - REQUEST FOR CHECK OF IDENTI-

FICATION DIVISION RECORDS - SUBMISSION OF LATENT FINGER-

PRINT EVIDENCE AND REQUEST FOR TESTIMONY OF LATENT

FINGERPRINT EXAMINERS -- In the past year the Identification Division

name files grew to a record 168 million index cards representing ap-

proximately 82 million persons. Also, requests of the Latent Finger-

print Section for latent print examinations, testimony and training

continued to increase at an unprecedented rate, The great demands

being made on these facets of the Bureau's operation necessitate that

current procedures be reviewed at this time and that all investigative

personnel be reminded to follow these procedures in order to be assured

of continued, prompt and positive handling of their requests.

When requesting a name search it should be borne in mind that

the Identification Division's name indices and fingerprint records are keyed

to FBI, local arrest, and military service numbers: therefore, this infor-

mation should be furnished at all times, where possible, to assist in the

search and further for the purpose of providing a positive reply. Also, in

view of the present size of the name files, requests for searches of common

names should be avoided until sufficient identifying data is obtained and

submitted to aid in the search.

In making requests for the services of the Latent Fingerprint

Section the following procedures should be borne in mind: (1) When sub-

mitting evidence for examination the original items should be submitted

wherever possible instead of photographs of the latent lifts. If the original

items cannot be, submitted, of course, photographs will suffice. (2) Re-

quests for the appearances of Fingerprint Examiners at preliminary and

grand jury hearings should be discouraged and in lieu of such appearances

the appropriate Latent Fingerprint Section reports should be used if at all

possible. (3) The Bureau should be given as much advance notice as

possible when requesting testimony of Fingerprint Examiners so as to

avoid any conflicts in court commitments. (4) All cancellations of testi-

mony should be furnished to the Bureau by the most expeditious means to

preclude possible unnecessary travel. (5) Prosecuting attorneys should

be encouraged to release Fingerprint Examiner personnel as soon as

possible after testimony.

available for noncombatant military service only), I-Y (registrant

qualified for military service only in time of war or national emergency),

IV-F (registrant not qualified for any military service), etc. Results

of inquiry should be set forth under general comments, item 35, of the

FD-190, Interview Form. If the inquiry is answered in the affirmative,

the applicant must execute a written release permitting the Bureau to

obtain any necessary information from the Selective Service Board

pertaining to his classification. Appropriate manual changes will be

(C) ACCOMPLISHMENTS - CONVICTIONS -- With the change in the

administration on January 20, 1969, and with a new Attorney General

heading the Department of Justice, it is conceivable that within the next

few months there will be several changes in United States Attorneys!

offices throughout the country. It is your responsibility to thoroughly

indoctrinate new United States Attorneys and new Assistant United States

Attorneys immediately upon their assumption of office. It is incumbent

on you to stress the necessity of prosecuting all violations within the

Bureau's investigative jurisdiction and the need for all United States

Attorneys to adopt a prompt and aggressive prosecutive policy.

You are again reminded that you must closely follow the

personnel situation as regards Federal Judges and in the United States

Attorneys' offices. If any shortage exists which has an effect on the

handling of our cases such shortage must immediately be brought to

the attention of the Bureau.

(D) FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY ASSOCIATES RETRAINING SESSIONS

FOR 1969 -- Advise the Bureau, Attention: Training Division, by

June 1, 1969, the dates and places of your 1969 retraining sessions for

graduates of the FBI National Academy. If your retraining session

will be held in advance of that date, Bureau should be given at least

30 days' notice. The Bureau should be furnished with the detailed

program to be followed, and your personal attention should be given

to the planning of these sessions to make certain that the emphasis is

on subject matter of value and interest to the graduates who will attend.

All correspondence should be directed to the Bureau,

Attention: Training Division, and should be submitted on an unless-

advised-to-the-contrary-by-Bureau (UACB) basis.

You are reminded that there will be a Sectional Retraining

Session in Section III (Southeastern States) from July 13-16, 1969, at

the Americana Hotel, Bal Harbour, Florida. No regularly scheduled

chapter retraining sessions should be held in Section II during 1969.

Graduates from the Southeastern States as well as from the rest of the

chapters should be invited to participate in your field firearms training

programs, police schools, and other Bureau functions.

To assist the host Florida Chapter in Miami, each Special

Agent in Charge of field offices located in states making up Section III

should make certain that all eligible graduates in their territories

are aware of the retraining session in Bal Harbour and have notified

the secretary of their own chapter whether they expect to attend.

Any graduate in good standing is welcome to attend Sectional

Retraining Sessions whether or not he works in that section. Any

graduate expecting to attend the Sectional Retraining Session in 1969

should be advised to make proper reservations through the host chapter

without delay. Each SAC must give his personal attention to stimulating

interest in not only the Sectional Retraining Session in Florida but also

each of the other chapter retraining sessions.

(E) PROGRAM JUSTIFICATION, + U. S. ATTORNEYS AND THE

EXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR U. S. ATTORNEYS -- One of our field offices

on a confidential basis obtained a copy of captioned document which was

prepared by the Department of Justice. It is probable other U. S.

Attorneys have received a copy of this document.

In summary, the Department apparently prepared this

document in an effort to consider certain prosecutive priorities

recognizing the increase in Federal crime and the limited manpower

available to prosecute violators.

Some of the views set forth in this document were previously

brought to the Bureau's attention, and we submitted our observations

relative to those items falling within our jurisdiction and interest. With

reference to the proposal concerning prosecution of interstate Irans-

portation of Stolen Motor Vehicle (ITSMV) subjects, we have told the

Department that we feel that prosecution of ITSMV violators should

not be restricted to commercial cases and aduits but rather each case

should be considered on its individual merits. Our expression has

never been acknowledged by the Department.

It would appear the items concerning prosecution as set

forth in the captioned document are suggestions which could be followed

and are not at this point binding on all U. S. Attorneys. We know from

experience that many U. S. Attorneys continue to authorize Federal

prosecution for ITSMV violators in other than commercial cases and in

aggravated situations where juveniles are involved.

This is being brought to your attention so you will be aware

of this document and the Bureau's position with regard to prosecution

of ITSMV cases.

(G) DESERTER MATTERS - SANCTUARY SITUATIONS -- There have been

several instances in the recent past where servicemen have taken so-called

"sanctuary" in churches or other public buildings.

The Department of Defense has issued instructions to all

branches of the military which clarifies the jurisdiction for this type of case.

Briefly, the responsibility remains with the military to apprehend deserter

fugitives in all instances where both deserter fugitives and other absentees

are present in the same "sanctuary" since it has the authority to arrest

both deserters and those in absent without leave status. The Bureau will

only make the apprehension where the deserter fugitive investigation was

in progress prior to the time information is developed that the fugitive is

in a so-called "sanctuary" and there are no other military absentees present.

If we have been investigating a deserter and he takes sanctuary while we

are looking for him, we will handle the sanctuary situation.

You should be alert in this type of case to any possible violation

of Title 18, Section 1381, United States Code: (FBI Handbook, Part III,

page 83b) for harboring a deserter, enticing or procuring desertion or

refusal to give up a deserter upon demand of an authorized officer. Facts

indicating a possible violation of this statute should be presented to the

United States Attorney.

(H) CIVIL SERVICE STATUS - NATIONAL GUARD TECHNICIANS --

Effective 1-1-69, National Guard technicians will assume status as civil

service employees of the Department of the Army and the Department

of the Air Force in conformance with provisions of Public Law 90-486,

the National Guard Technicians Act of 1968. The implication of these

employees in allegations relative to fraud, bribery, or related violations

would, subsequent to 12-31-68, bring such activity within the possible

scope of Federal criminal statutes. Of course, allegations relating to a

period prior to 1-1-69 would have occurred while such individuals were

state employees and should continue to be referred to the appropriate

authorities.

(I) INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PREPARATION OF EXPLOSIVE AND

INCENDIARY DEVICES BY TERRORISTS - SABOTAGE -- For your pos-

sible assistance in sabotage or other investigations within the Bureau's

jurisdiction involving explosive or incendiary devices, there are attached

for each office two copies of a translated reproduction of instructions

in Spanish reportedly seized by the Venezuelan National Guard from a

terrorist. Believed to be of Cuban origin, these instructions relate to

the preparation of components as well as finished explosive and incendiary

devices.

Bureau experience with bombing matters has not revealed any

specific instances where the device used was prepared from these in-

structions. Nevertheless, they should be brought to the attention of

investigative personnel and should be considered by them during investi-

gations as noted above, particularly where Cubans (either pro-Castro or

anti-Castro) or Cuban-trained suspects are involved. In the latter

category might be included also any extremist militants of the New Left

or Black Power movements who may have visited Cuba, received training

there, or who have Cuban contacts with subversive backgrounds. Any

specific example or indication that a device was prepared from these

instructions should be brought promptly to the Bureau's attention.

The foregoing in no way alters standing instructions concern-

ing the handling of explosives by Bureau personnel. As in the past, they

should be guided in such matters by instructions in the Agent's Handbook,

Part III, Chapter 65, page 160, and the Manual of Instructions, Section

86, pages 5 and 7.

(A) BỌY SCOUTS OF AMERICA SPECIAL INTEREST EXPLORER

POSTS - COOPERATION WITH -- The Chairman of the United States

Civil Service Commission has furnished information concerning Boy

Scouts of America Special Interest Explorer Posts, which the Depart-

ment has requested we bring to the attention of all FBI Field Divisions.

The program is designed to bring the principles of scouting to inner

city, disadvantaged youth by the establishment of these special posts,

sponsored by various organizations. The Federal Executive Boards

(FEB) have been urged to sponsor some of these posts. The Department

asked that the FBI support the Boards in this effort.

While the Bureau is in accord with the aims of this program,

it is not desired that any FBI Office act as official sponsor for any

Boy Scout group. Should you be approached by either the Boy Scouts

or a representative of the FEB, our cooperation should be limited to

providing Bureau speakers and offering tours of FBI facilities.

(B) NEW LEFT MOVEMENT - POLICE TRAINING MATTER --

Recently various field offices have proposed that Special Agents familiar •

with the New Left movement speak before groups of local law enforcement

personnel concerning this movement. The Bureau is of the opinion

that such talks or briefings concerning the New Left movement would

be beneficial to both the FBI and law enforcement; however, should be

handled by a qualified speaker from the Seat of Government familiar

with all current and national facets of this movement as well as being

completely versed in Bureau policy.

The Bureau will, therefore, consider on a highly selective

basis requests from the field to send a qualified representative to speak

before closed meetings of local law enforcement personnel. This talk

would best be handled in conjunction with a school or conterence con-

cerning other police matters. The field office requesting a Bureau

speaker in this matter should have strong control over the school or

conference. Submit request setting forth date of school or conference,

the number of law entorcement personnel attending, and your comments

on why you feel this talk would be a benefit to this particular group.

This should not be interpreted to mean that the Bureau is

soliciting invitations for wide-spread participation in briefing of local

law enforcement personnel in regard to New Left matters.

To the

contrary it is felt that briefing of this nature should be held to a minimum

and should only be given to command level law enforcement administrators

on a very selective basis. I personally intend to examine each and every

request for a briefing of this type to insure that it is worthwhile and

justifies the time, effort, and expenditure of money necessary to handle

such commitments.

a space for reporting recovery value of a vehicle and the source of that

recovery value. In addition, the brief statement of facts on this form

must include information showing the stolen vehicle was transported inter-

state, its model year, make, and Vehicle Identification Number.

(2) All other ITSMV cases, including cases with more than one

investigative character. Report recovery of vehicles on FD-410. This

form is to be completely filled in and has sufficient spaces for data on it

to allow the Bureau to record your automobile recoveries. The spaces

for this data are all self-explanatory. At the bottom of the form is a

space entitled "Give Brief Summary of Investigation Conducted to Date:"

in which you are to set forth in teletype language a succinct summary of

the investigation conducted by your office in order to insure field and

Seat of Government supervisory personnel that the case has received

appropriate investigative attention. Two copies of the FD-410 are to be

furnished to the Bureau.

With the automobile recovery reported on either the FD-387

or the FD-410, there will be no need to submit investigative reports in

cases deferred to local prosecutors or in unknown subject ITSMV cases

where all logical investigation has been completed in the initial 90 days

of investigation, and may be closed on the authority of the Special Agent

in Charge. In known subject ITSMV cases, it will be necessary to sub-

mit an FD-410 and an investigative report.

In no instance will an auto-

mobile recovery be reported in an investigative report for the purpose

of recording at the Bureau in any ITSMV case.

Intrastate stolen vehicles recovered during the course of our

investigations are to be set forth on FD-410 with proper justification.

(C) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- Information has

recently been received that an individual who is attempting to form a

Black Panther Party organization in Washington, D. C., has suggested

that young members of the Black Panther Party can help identify FBI

informants by gaining the acquaintanceship of FBI female personnel.

This again highlights the ever present danger of infiltration

not only of our informant ranks but also even of the ranks of our

employees. While our investigations and system of operation are

geared to uncover any "plant," we must never lose sight of this pos-

sibility, since penetration of law enforcement agencies is a priority

target of these extremist groups. Accordingly, immediately reevaluate

security measures currently in operation in your office to insure that

the security of our operations, files, and identities of informants are

fully safeguarded. Within 30 days of receipt of this letter, advise the

results of your evaluation.

(A) "THE FBI IN OUR OPEN SOCIETY" BY HÄRRY AND BONARO

OVERSTREET -- W. W. Norton Company has just published "The

FBI in Our Open Society" by Harry and Boraro Overstreet. This is

an excellent book and portrays the FBI in a most favorable way. Dr.

and Mrs. Overstreet, weil-known scholars and educators, have

carefully studied and refuted the false charges made against the Bureau

by such vicious critics as Max Lowenthal, Fred J. Cook and William

W. Turner. The Overstreets emphasize that the operations of the FBI

do not in any way represent a threat to the freedoms of our free and

open society and that charges that the Bureau is a national police

agency are completely false. The book is highly readable, intellectually

stimulating and extremely lucid..

• The Bureau has made arrangements with W. W. Norton

Company to secure copies of this book for sale to employees at the

special discount rate of $3.75.

You should survey your personnel and advise the Bureau

promptly of the number of books to be sent to your office. All initial

orders should be submitted by routing slip marked "Attention, Crime

Records Section" and should be accompanied by one check payable to

the FBI Recreation Association covering the entire order. Subsequently,

of course, additional orders can be submitted in the same manner.

In order to facilitate the handling of orders, one employee

should be designated in each office or section at the Seat of Government

to coordinate the orders. All books mailed will be addressed to the

SAC but should be distributed in the various offices by the employee

handling orders. The Bureau should be notified if books ordered are

not received within a few weeks so they can be traced through the mails.

aggregate $200. This authority is hereby increased to $400.

Keep in mind this instruction in no way lessens your

responsibility to insure money expended for criminal informant

development is on a C.O.D. basis and that full value is received for

all funds disbursed. You should thoroughly scrutinize every request

to pay criminal sources and make certain all payments are completely

justified.

Your expenditures to informants will continue to be the

subject of careful examination by the Bureau and will be reviewed at

the time your office is inspected. Appropriate manual changes forth-

coming.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION•

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

March 11, 1969

(A) FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY - 84TH SESSION -- By April 1, 1969,

you should submit to the Bureau, Attention: Training Division, the names

of candidates from your territory whom you desire to recommend to

attend the 84th Session of the FBI National Academy, which convenes

August 18, 1969, and will graduate November 5, 1969. A specific state-

ment must be made concerning the review of your field oftice indices on

the applicants and their law enforcement agencies in the letter listing

your candidates.

Alternate candidates who were investigated for the 83rd Session

of the National Academy and not invited to attend that session in view of

lack of space will be considered the principal candidates for the 84th

Session of the National Academy from the field offices covering their law

enforcement agencies.

All candidates nominated for the 84th Session must have been

interviewed by the current Special Agent in Charge. It such has not been

done, appropriate interview form should be submitted along with your

recommendations. It is expected that only outstanding candidates who

have a potential in the training or administrative fields will be nominated.

Since the Bureau now pays travel and subsistence allowances to attendees,

those offices covering more than one state should, where feasible,

nominate a candidate from each of those states.

(B) LEAVE - CHANGES IN POLICY -- One year's Bureau service will

no longer be required as the minimum for an employee to qualify for

maternity leave. Six months' service will henceforth suffice for this

purpose.

The requirement enunciated in SAC Letter 69-3 that all requests

for leave without pay would require Bureau approval is hereby modified.

Only those requests for leave without pay exceeding one day will require

such approval. This change in no way broadens the reasons for which

leave without pay can be granted; it simply relieves division heads of the

necessity for securing Bureau approval of leave without pay of a day or

less for those purposes for which Bureau policy has previously provided

leave without pay. Any request for leave without pay not included within

those purposes will require Bureau approval even though it may be for

one day or less.

(C) ASSOCIATED CREDIT BUREAUS, INC. -- The Associated Credit

Bureaus (ACB), Inc., which is a trade association, and has some 2100

member credit bureaus, has issued guidelines to protect consumer privacy.

One of the guidelines pertains to service to noncredit granting govern-

mental agencies. The guidelines provide that member credit bureaus

may supply to those agencies under contract identifying information

such as names, addresses, former addresses, places of employment

or former employment. Any other information in credit bureau files will

be supplied only in response to legal process unless the investigation

is for security purposes.

A source at ACB has advised that these guidelines would affect

the FBI; however, they are worded broadly enough not to stop credit

bureaus from furnishing the necessary information. Certain types of

information could be furnished under a contract basis and other infor-

mation could be furnished under the same contract basis in security-

type investigations which would include, according to the source,

applicant-type investigations. If the individual credit bureau continues

to furnish the requested information without contract or agreement, the

issue should not be raised. In those instances where member credit

bureaus will not furnish such information without some agreement along

the line of the above guidelines, you are authorized to sign such an

agreement if it does not go into such matters as a membership fee and

other charges. A copy of each such signed agreement should be furnished

to the Bureau.

Credit bureau agreements and contracts concerning charges

to be made by the credit bureaus for their services should, as in the

past, be forwarded to the Bureau with your recommendation as to

acceptance.

(D) FLEX-CUE TIES - TEMPORARY RESTRAINING DEVICES -- For-

warded under separate cover is a supply of white nylon Flex-Cuf Ties

with an appropriate number for training purposes with the locking barb

removed. The training ties are dyed a distinctive red color to prevent

confusion with those that may be used in arrest situations. Since these

devices can be removed by sustained application of intense flame or

sharp instrument, appropriate searches and subsequent guarding of

restrained persons are paramount, as in the case of any arrest.

It is imperative that all of our Agents receive training in their

use. Field police instructors should afford training to police agencies

requesting same.

These devices are not meant to replace handcuffs but are an

expendable alternate restraining device to augment the present supply

of handcuffs in your office. They can be made available to Agents, at

your discretion, to be carried in the glove compartment of Bureau cars,

brief cases or on the person.

The August, 1968, issue of the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin

sets forth specifications of these devices as well as methods of utilizing

them. The Planning and Research Unit of the Training Division is pre-

paring a Police Instructor's Bulletin with additional techniques for their

application. These ties have a one-time use and must be cut to be

removed.

To avoid severe wrist and finger cuts, diagonal or cutting

pliers are recommended to remove them.

(E) NIGHT-VIEWING EQUIPMENT - SURVEILLANCES -- There is

available from the Radio Engineering Section of the Laboratory a new

night- viewing device called the "Starlight Scope." This unit is completely

portable and is packaged in a luggage-type metal carrying case. The

viewing unit operates on one self-contained 6. 75-volt mercury cell which

will give efficient service from 50 to 100 hours, depending upon the

frequency of viewer use.

Functioning of this device is based on the

technique of low-light level image intensification or amplification. It

utilizes and amplifies the natural or ambient light radiations (moonlight

or starlight) emanating from the night sky which are reflected by the

scene under surveillance. As a result, no artificial illumination, such

as infrared, is needed to flood the area for night observation.

Government reservations where there are no known aggravating or

unusual circumstances, immediately present the facts to the United

States Attorney for a prosecutive opinion. If the United States Attorney

will not prosecute the matter, conduct no investigation, advise the

complainant, and confirm your conversations to the United States

Attorney and the complainant in writing. Where appropriate, the matter

in crime on Government reservation-type cases continue in eifect.

Offenses such as trespassing, traffic violations, etc., should not be

particular areas of interest to the Department of Justice in the investi-

gation of campus disorders.

In view of the Department of Justice's interest in campus

disorders, you are to intensity your efforts to obtain the information set

out in the Assistant Attorney General's letter. In spite of the fact that

additional student informants cannot be developed, you will be held

responsible for obtaining the desired information.

Convention the various districts will hold conventions to elect delegates

for the National Convention and prepare resolutions to be presented at

one delegate for each district plus one delegate for each 15 dues-paying

members in the district. The Party expects 200 to 250 delegates to

attend the 19th National Convention. Identification of these delegates

is essential and should provide an indication of the number of dues-paying

members in each district.

Special efforts must be made to determine exactly where the

19th National Convention will be held in New York City, details of

resolutions prepared in each district and how delegates will vote on

controversial issues at the National Convention. Each office must in-

struct its informants to be alert to obtain the desired information. This

matter must receive continuous attention. The Bureau and New York

programs contained political propaganda, as defined in the Registration

Act, and are made available to American radio stations through the

services of the U.S. Bureau of Radio Moscow, the U.S. Bureau of Radio

Moscow would incur the obligation to label, file copies and report on

the dissemination of these taped programs.

You should contact established sources in radio field, your

division, for any information concerning receipt of correspondence from

captioned organization. Upon receipt of information, furnish Bureau

with communication suitable for dissemination, classified "Confidential."

Copies of your communications should be furnished to New York and

Washington Field for information.

are entitled "Neutron Activation Analysis" and "Instrumental

Examinations, " which are approximately five minutes each in

length, and "Examination of Soils and Minerals, Hairs and Fibers,

Toolmarks, Tire and Shoe Impressions, " which is approximately

ten minutes in length. They are 16-millimeter sound films in

color.

In addition to being shown to law enforcement groups

for which you are providing training, these films have also been

designed for use in connection with speaking engagements and

television appearances in which you have been invited to participate.

A permanent retention copy is being forwarded to each field office.

67-38 advised no warning of rights is necessary so long as the

interrogation of the deserter suspect or subject is confined to

identification only. Military court restrictions on interviews of

such deserters have resulted in the need to eliminate this special

provision. Handle deserter cases in accordance with the general

rules applicable in other FBI cases of in-custody interrogation.

(F) DESERTER MATTERS - REQUEST FOR FOREIGN

INVESTIGATION -- There has been a significant increase in the

number of deserter fugitives being sought by the Bureau who have

fled to Canada and other countries. To facilitate handling the

letterhead memoranda both at the Seat of Government and by the

Legal Attaches, you should insure that the requirements as set forth

in the FBI Handbook, Part I, page 50b, are closely followed.

Some of the most frequent errors in the preparation of the

letterhead memoranda are: failure to set out specific investigation

required, requesting that servicemen be interviewed rather than

having their residence verified, use of the property stamp, and

occasionally requesting the arrest of the servicemen.

After setting forth the specific investigation desired, the

letterhead memorandum should request that the deserter fugitive's

presence in the country of asylum be verified. No request for arrest

should be made. Since the letterhead memorandum is to be delivered

to the foreign investigating agency, it should not contain the usual

restrictive property statement.

(H) NATIONALITY GROUP COVERAGE - LATIN AMERICA -- Your

attention is directed to SAC Letters 65-31 (A) dated June 2, 1965, and

66-8 (D) dated February 1, 1966, both of which stressed the importance

attached by the Bureau to Latin-American investigations and related

matters in this field.

In the recent past, the press has reported a statement by

a high-ranking United States official that President Richard M. Nixon

plans a trip to Latin America, possibly at the end of this year. The

official described the President as very interested in stepping up

United States economic aid and improving relations with Latin America.

The current attempt of a Presidential envoy to ease the United States-

Peruvian crisis and the projected visits to Latin America on the

President's behalf by Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, beginning in

April, 1969, attest to the President's concern.

The Bureau has received no official notification of

Presidential plans for travel to Latin America. However, stepped-up

anti-United States nationalistic influences, increased diplomatic and

commercial relations with Soviet-bloc countries, and efforts of the

latter to promote discord and subversion in the area are likely to

generate continuing and grave problems with ramifications in the

United States.

We should anticipate that the need for pertinent

intelligence data will remain acute in the foreseeable future. Therefore,

the Bureau is stressing at this time the necessity for adequate coverage

of Latin-American exile organizational activities, plots to overthrow

existing governments, and general activity of importance from an

intelligence standpoint. Significant developments should be reported

expéditiously:

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

Director

(A) PUBLIC LAW 90-365 - PAYROLL MATTER - VOLUNTARY

ALLOTMENTS TO FINANCIAL ORGANIZATIONS -- SAC Letter Number

68-74 dated December 24, 1968, advised that captioned Law provides

for allotments from salaries of employees for deposit to financial

organizations.

The Bureau's payroll system has now been redesigned to

permit the processing of voluntary allotments to financial organizations.

Detailed information and instructions concerning the program are being

furnished separately in the form of a Memorandum to All Employees.

An initial supply of SF-1189 and SF-1198 is being forwarded

to your office under separate cover. The SF-1189 is the prescribed

Standard Form to be used in requesting an allotment of net pay for credit

to a checking account with a designated financial organization. The

SF-1198 is the Standard Form to be used in requesting an allotment of

pay for credit to a savings account with a financial organization. Should

you need additional forms they may be requisitioned from the Bureau.

You should assure that all employees of your office carefully

read the instructions being forwarded to them before making any allotment

in order that they will be fully aware of the procedures to be followed and

the possible difficulty they may encounter.

Your office can be of considerable assistance in the

implementation of this program by insuring that each request is properly

executed before it is submitted to the Bureau. In forwarding the allotment

requests to the Bureau, the transmittal communication should be marked

to the attention of the Voucher-Statistical Section.

Necessary manual changes will be forwarded under separate

cover.

(D) BANK LARCENY -- The Criminal Division of the Department recently

advised that false statements by a person which induce a bank to turn over

the possession of funds to that person, but where there is no intention on

the bank's part to convey title, constitute a crime of larceny by trick in

violation of 18, U.S. Code, 2113 (b). An example is a person who falsely

poses as an armored car employee authorized to pick up certain funds

for delivery to a stated place, and by the impersonation induces the bank

to relinquish possession of the funds. The bank did not intend to deliver

title to the impersonator, just as it had no intention to deliver title to the

armored car employee.

Title remained in the bank. Abuse of title is

larceny and, as such, is covered by 18, U.S. Code, 2113 (b).

The Department reiterated its position that larceny by false

pretense, that is, the obtaining of both possession and title by fraudulent

representation, (quick change artist, fake rolled coins, fraudulent

passbook withdrawals, etc.) is not covered under the Federal Bank Robbery

and Incidental Crimes Statute. In these situations the bank intends to

transfer title of the money to the person making the false representation.

In situations which arise where there is doubt whether the act

committed constitutes larceny under the Federal Bank Robbery Statute,

the U. S. Attorney should be consulted and the Bureau advised.

POLICE INSTRUCTOR'S BULLETIN -- Regulations contained in the Bank

Protection Act of 1968 will substantially increase the use of silent alarms

in banking institutions covered by the Federal Bank Robbery and Incidental

Crimes Statute. It is apparent many more police officers, as well as

Agents, will arrive at banking institutions while a robbery is still in

progress.

On April 22, 1969, Training Division forwarded to your

Office an ample supply of the Bulletin "Responding to Silent Alarms"

which deals with the many dangers and problems inherent in such situations.

You will immediately insure that material contained in

Captioned Bulletin is discussed with all Agent personnel in your Division.

Since police department regulations vary regarding response to silent

alarms, it is imperative that your bank robbery plans be compatible with

bank robbery plans of law enforcement agencies in your Division.

TODAY" -- Set forth below is an up-to-date characterization of "Labor

Today" which replaces the one in SAC Letter 68-54.

In January, 1962, a source advised that on January 13, 1962,

Gus Hall, General Secretary of the Communist Party, USA, (CPUSA)

remarked that a Party-supported trade-union publication would be issued

in the near future and would appear under the name "Labor Today."

On January 5, 1962, records in the Assumed Name Section

of the County Clerk's Office, Wayne County, Detroit, Michigan, indicated

Certificate Number 145344 issued for conducting business under an

assumed name, was issued to "Labor Today" (a bimonthly publication)

having a business address at 12065 Wyoming, Detroit 4, Michigan. A

certificate was filed on January 2, 1962, and the names of the persons

listed as owning, conducting and transacting the business were Charles

H. Walters, 9309 Memorial, Detroit, Michigan, and Eve Neidelman,

19972 Marlowe, Detroit, Michigan.

A second source advised on December 15, 1961, that

Charles Walters was then a member of the Michigan District CP State

Committee. This source advised on September 18, 1959, that Eve

Neidelman was then a member of the Michigan District CP State

Committee.

A third source advised on January 18, 1966, that as of

December 31, 1965, Eve Neidelman was a member of the Miscellaneous

Jewish Community Club, Michigan District CP.

The Founding Statement contained in the first issue of

"Labor Today" (Spring, 1962) indicated two additional issues would be

forthcoming in 1962, and beginning in 1963, "Labor Today" would appear

regularly as a "bimonthly journal. "

The masthead of "Labor Today, " Volume 8, Number 1,

February, 1969, issue states that "Labor Today" is presently being

published monthly except August by "Labor Today Associates, " a

(G) RACIAL AND SECURITY INFORMANTS -- Recently an informant

voluntarily advised a police officer who was investigating a case that he

was assisting the FBI.

While this police officer has maintained the

confidence of the above information, this incident should not have occurred.

There has been another incident where an informant has voluntarily

disclosed his identity as a source of this Bureau and his actions were not

in keeping with the Bureau's system of controlling and directing the

informants.

In view of the above, each Special Agent in Charge must

insure that Special Agents operating informants impress on these

informants the necessity of informants maintaining the confidential nature

of their relationship with the FBI.

It should also be impressed upon the informants that in the

event they have any doubts as to what course of action to take, they should

immediately contact a representative of the FBI and be guided by the

instructions given to them.

In addition, each Special Agent handling informants must

afford these informants close supervision and control so that incidents can

be avoided which may affect Bureau operations.

Each Special Agent in Charge is being held personally

responsible to insure that the Special Agents assigned to his division are

affording the informants being operated by them tight supervision and

control in accordance with the above.

(A) NATIONAL BANK ROBBERY ALBUM (NABRA) - BANK

ROBBERY MATTERS -- Based on experience, NABRA items will

pared for the Fugitive Bank Robbery Program (FUBANK). Distribution

of NABRA items to each office will be made on the same basis as

FUBANK.

It will no longer be necessary to submit a photograph of

ascertain whether he was involved in violations contained in NABRA.

In the future, whenever an identifiable bank camera photograph

is available and the case has been under investigation for 30 days without

ascertaining the identity of the subject, the Bureau should be requested

to include the photograph in NABRA. If in any particular case such

action is not deemed advisable, the Bureau should be appropriately

advised. Artist's conception drawings prepared by the Bureau will

continue to be considered for NABRA upon request of the office of

necessity of maintaining the confidential nature of their relationship

with the FBI.

Furthermore, I want each Special Agent in Charge to impress

upon Special Agents dealing with individuals, whether they are Bureau-

approved informants or those voluntarily contacting your office, who

provide information about the New Left, that every interview must be

on a most discreet and completely professional basis. Also, extreme

caution should be used at all times to be certain that the individuals

are not plants. All conversations should be most circumspect because

of the possibility of the conversations being recorded. Individuals who

have not been approved by the Bureau as informants shouid not be

directed or guided in the event they volunteer to provide information

in the future concerning New Left activities.

(C) STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY - SUBVERSIVE ORGANI-

ZATION CHARACTERIZATION -- Set forth below is a current characteri-

zation of Students for a Democratic Society which should be utilized in

the future when it is necessary to characterize this organization in

investigative reports and other types of communications.

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the Students for a Democratic

Society (SDS), as it is known today, came into being at a founding

. convention held at Port Huron, Michigan, in June, 1962. From an

initial ideological posture of "participatory democracy," the current

line of the national leadership reveals an adherence to Marxism-Leninism.

Michael Klonsky, National Secretary, in March, 1969, called for the

building of a revolutionary Marxist-Leninist movement.

The program

of SDS has moved from involvement in civil rights struggles to an anti-

Vietnam war position and finally to its present advocacy of an anti-

imperialist line, linking up the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and

Latin America with the black liberation movement in the United States.

China; Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as countries which are leading

the world-wide struggles against United States imperialism. On the

other hand, SDS regards tne Soviet Union as an imperialist power and

does not support the policies of that country.

SDS maintains a National Office in Room 206, 1608 West

Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois. Its official paper "New Left Notes"

reflects the line of the national leadership and program adopted at

meetings of the National Council and National Interim Committee

(NIC)• Three national officers and a NIC of eleven members are

elected each year during a June National Convention.

SDS Regional Offices and university and college chapters

elect delegates to National Council meetings wherein program and

ideology are debated, but each Region and chapter is autonomous in

nature and is free to carry out independent policy and programs

reflective of local conditions.

(D) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS - With the coming

of summer, many of the radical Negro students on college campuses

who have been creating such havoc will undoubtedly interrupt their studies

for the summer months. The hatred engendered in them by their

campus agitation will undoubtedly follow them into the communities

where they will be living. It is logical to assume that they will continue

to demonstrate their anarchistic feelings by engaging in or seeking to

promote racial violence. The most logical areas for such agitation are

the Negro ghettos.

In view of the above, you must immediately reevaluate your

informant coverage in the ghetto areas in your division. In those areas

where such coverage is not already adequate to thoroughly saturate every

level of activity in the ghetto, you must make immediate aggressive

efforts to expand such coverage to adequate levels. This matter must

be given immediate and continuous attention in view of the extremely

costly potential in loss of human lives and property which can result

from unchecked racial violence.

Your primary goal in developing a network of ghetto-type

racial informants must be to have such coverage as to enable you to

advise appropriate local and Federal authorities in advance of potential

large scale racial violence. Only by a network of ghetto informants

sufficiently widespread to develop information of that type can the

Bureau fulfill its current responsibilities.

is to be brought to the attalion of all investigalive personnel.

The FBI Laboratory has the capability to make technical

examinations of physical evidence and to furnish competent expert

testimony in matters relating to numbers (numbers--pool, policy,

Bolita, Cuba, et cetera), horse racing, lottery in its several forms,

tip boards, et cetera.

Further, games and equipment (cards, dice,

electronic and mechanical devices, et cetera) related in the gaming

industry are examined io determine whether such paraphernalia is

fair or deliberately deceptive via alterations.

Generally, expert testimony will not be furnished on purely

hypothetical matters or general gambling procedures in cases where

no physical evidence was made available for Laboratory examination.

However, this specialized knowledge is available for guidance in these

matters.

(C) SABOTAGE -- The increased militancy of New Left, antiwar and

antid aft extremists has been directed against Reserve Officers'

Training Corps (ROZC) on campuses of colloges and universities

throughout the United States. These dissident protests have in many

cases resulted in damage to facilities and equipment utilized by ROTC

units.

The Department has determined that such facilities con-

stitute. "war premises" or "national defense premises" as defined in

the Sabotage Statutes, Sections 2151 - 2156, Title 18, U. S. Code.

One conviction has resulted.

The investigation of such incidents should be handled in

accordance with procedures and policies set forth in Section 86, Manual

of Instructions.

These cases must be vigorously pursued and promptly

reported in order that the Department may be furnished the necessary

information on which it can base a prosecutive opinion.

Such incidents often constitute violations of other Federal

laws within the investigative jurisdiction of the Bureau such as

Destruction of Government Property and Interference with Government

Communications System, You should insure that with regard to these

deliberate acts of violence, the possibility of sabotage is thoroughly

explored and that all communications include that character.

(D) OMNIBUS CRIME CONTROL AND SAFE STREETS ÄCT OF 1968 --

Recently the Attorney General furnished the Bureau detailed instructions

relating to eluctronic surveillances (wirciaps and microp'one coverage)

in the internal security field which are pertinent to captioned Act. A

summary of the instructions is being furnished herein for your guidance

and compliance. When requesting authority for an electronic surveillance,

make certain all additional data now required is set forth in Form FD-142.

For reasons of security, electronic surveillances in the

internal security field should be requested under the Presidential

authorization provision of the Act; however, if prosecution appears

likely, consideration should be given to recommending use of a court

order. Basis for the type desired should be clearly set forth.

The Supreme Court's decisions have shown that the legality

of the interception is of prime importance in determining whether

information regarding electronic surveillance must be disclosed to a

defendant whose conversation has been intercepted, Therefore, future

requests for electronic surveillances in the internal security field

should contain:

(1). An identification of the premises and location, and the

room or office, in which the interception device is to be placed or phone

to which such a device is to be attached and facts regarding the instal-

lation to assist in determining whether a trespass will be involved.

• se

(2). A general description of the activities subject is engaged

in and the type of information which it is anticipated will be obtained

through the electronic coverage.

(3). The period of time for which approval is requested,.

with subsequent advice as to date of installation.

(4). Whether it is anticipated that the conversations of any

other subject who is under active investigation for possible criminal

violations will be overheard.

With regard to tape recordings of intercepted conversations,

such tapes should be preseived for a minimum period of ten years.

If it is anticipated results will be introduced into evidence

or leads to evidence will be obtained where installation is being

recommended under the Presidential authorization, the following

additional information should be included:

(1). The crime or crimes which it is believed are being

committed by the person or persons whose conversations are likely

to be overheard.

(2). A complete description of the investigation being con-

ducted - its origin, development and present status. This description

should include a detailed analysis of all investigative procedures

utilized and a statement as to their inadequacy and the need to use the

proposed technique.

(3). The names and backgrounds of each prospective subject

of the investigation.

(4). A description of the communications expected to be

intercepted, together with an analysis of the relevance of the communi-

cation to the investigation.

Requests for coverage should be for no longer than a period

of thirty days, subject, of course, to requests for extension.

Dissemination of intercepted information may be made to

other intelligence and law enforcement agencies and allies of the United

States on a need-to-know basis and should be appropriately classified,

and in no case violate the dissemination limitations which are currently

imposed upon classified national defense information. If evidence of

possible criminal conduct is developed, extreme caution should be

exercised in disseminating the information outside of the FBI and the

information should be clearly identified as having originated from an

electronic surveillance. If a question should arise whether a particular

It is realized that the instructions present certain serious

problems, such as preservation of tapes for a minimum of ten years,

and also certain questions, such as the manner of identifying information

as coming from an electronic surveillance when disseminating infor-

mation of a possible criminal conduct. These and other such matters

will be taken up with the Department for clarification.

Pending the

receipt of clarification, howèver, you should follow the instructions

set out herein to the best of your ability, communicating with the

Bureau in the event a specific situation presents a special problem.

For your information, the Criminal Division of the Depart-

ment is currently preparing a "Manual for Conduct of Electronic

Surveillance" which will contain detailed instructions regarding the

form of, and the information to be contained in, future requests to the

Attorney General for authorization to apply for an interception order

from the courts.

WASHINGTON, D.&: 20333

June 24, 1969

(A) DR. VASSILIS C. P. MORFOPOULOS - EXPERT FINGERPRINT

TESTIMONY - IDENTIFICATION MATTER - The October, 1968, issue

of "The Legal Aid Briefcase," a publication of the National Legal Aid and

Defender Association, American Bar Center, Chicago, Illinois, published

an article entitled "Some Fingerprints Lie." This concerned a

murder

trial in Dutchess County, New York, in which Moropoulos testified as a

fingerprint expert for the defense.

Two prosecution fingerprint experts

had testified that a bloody latent fingerprint found on the headboard of the

victim's bed was identical with one of the fingerprints of the defendant.

Dr. Moropoulos testified that it was not identical with the fingerprint of

the defendant. The article extolled the expert testimony of Morfopoulos

and attempted to cast serious doubt on the infallibility of fingerprint

evidence.

FBI fingerprint experts have examined fingerprint evidence

in this case and found that the latent fingerprint is identical with the

fingerprint of the defendant. A letter of rebuttal has been sent to the

President of the National Legal Aid and Defender Association setting out

the true facts and correcting the erroneous impression conveyed by the

article with the suggestion that the letter be published in a future issue of

"The Legal Aid Briefcase."

Morfopoulos' qualifications as a fingerprint expert are deemed

to be questionable. He is described as being a Greek immigrant who

entered the United States in 1955 to attend school. He has a degree in

engineering science and is presently Director of the American Standards

Testing Bureau in New York City, a private concern. While his educa-

tional background appears extensive in certain scientific fields, he has

practically no background or experience in fingerprint work. He describes

himself as a microscopist, one who observes objects through a micro-

scope.

Should any information concerning this matter or the partici-

pation of Morfopoulos in the field of fingerprint identification or testimony

come to your attention, you should promptly advise the Bureau.

(B) LAW ENFORCEMENT EDUCATION - GRANTS AND LOANS - - The

Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 authorized a

program of educational aid to law enforcement officers and students

planning law enforcement careers. The Office of Academic Assistance,

of. the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, has just issued basic

information which should be made available to interested Special Agent

and clerical personnel of your office.

The educational aid is in the form of (1) grants and (2) loans.

Grants pay up to $300 per semester or $200 per quarter for eligible law

enforcement officers taking courses related to law enforcement. "Courses

related to law enforcement" are, for example, sociology, chemistry,

economics, computer science, and urban planning. The official interpre-

tation of "law enforcement officers" includes FBI Agents but not our non-

Agent personnel. Money is paid to the educational institution rather than

to the student.

The student must get his employer's certification that

the courses are of the appropriate kind and that he is employed as a law

enforcement officer. He must agree to remain with his agency for two

years following completion of any course covered by a grant. If he

violates the agreement he must repay the amount of the grant with T.o

interest. He cannot receive education benefits from the Veterans Admin-

istration concurrently.

Loans of up to $1800 per academic year can be made to full-

time students employed by a law enforcment agency or preparing to enter

law enforcement.

A "full-time student" is one carrying at least 75% of

the normal academic load. He must be pursuing studies leading to a

certificate or degree in an area directly related to law enforcement. If

he is enrolled in studies potentially relevant to other areas as well as law

enforcement such as chemistry, sociology, or economics, his overall

• curriculum must include a minimum of 15 semester credit hours or their

equivalent in law enforcement subjects. Examples of the latter are

criminal investigation, police administration and organization, criminology,

juvenile delinquency, and police community relations. A loan does not

prevent the pay the san isi concere a de ation benefits teament

begins. The total amount of the loan and interest is cancelled, if he serves

as a full-time law enforcement officer or employee, at the rate of 25'0

of the total for each full year of service. The borrowed money goes

directly to the participating educational institution, not to the borrower.

FBI clerks are potentially eligible to obtain such loans, which could help

them complete college studies designed to qualify them for the Special

Agent position.

Any employee desiring to apply for a loan or a grant should

contact the school of his choice to see if it is participating in the program

and if so as to the application procedure. Any documents required to be

executed by the employer should be forwarded to the Bureau, attention

Personnel Section, with a cover letter detailing the circumstances. It

now appears no such documents will be necessary for loan applications,

but the Bureau desires to be informed by you of any such applications for

record purposes, communications of this type also being directed to the

attention of the Personnel Section.

Arab terrorist groups such as Al-Fatah and United States subversive

organizations, including black nationalist and student radical groups.

Allegations have also been received that Arab terrorist

organizations intend to extend their operations into the United States

principally aimed at collecting funds and possibly to include terrorist

activities against the American Jewish community, Israeli property,

and prominent American and Israeli personalities.

All offices be alert for evidence of such action. Make certain

informant coverage of Arab activities is fully adequate to insure that we

(D) PROGRAM FOR DEVELOPMENT OF SELECTED CONTACTS

(DESECO) -- Effective immediately, the following streamlining

procedures should be followed in this program, which is designed to

develop individuals on a highly selective basis for eventual penetration

of Soviet-bloc intelligence activities.

If, during the "sounding-out" interview, the Deseco subject

• clearly exhibits a willingness and potential to cooperate with the Bureau,

he should be informed of our desire to have him participate in

* confidential activity in support of the Bureau's responsibility for the

protection of the internal security of the United States. He should

clearly understand that this cooperation may require his time and

effort beyond his normal occupational endeavors.

This procedure should assist in resolving that the individual

is ready, willing; and able to actively assist the Bureau and insure that

our ensuing background investigation is necessary and worthwhile.

If he continues to be cooperative and willing to assist the

Bureau actively, and the ensuing background investigation of him is

favorable, a summary of the results of the "sounding-out" interview

and background investigation should be submitted to the Bureau, advising.

on a UACB basis that he will be recontacted to further assess his

potential and availability, and specifically informed of our desire to

have him develop a relationship with a Soviet-bloc official. All other

procedures in the development and handling of the Deseco subject should

be in accordance with existing instructions. Appropriate changes in

the Manual of Instructions are forthcoming.

(À) INDEX SYSTEMS -- In an important case with great public

interest, an individual was not identified because of the failure of

an office to properly index a nickname.

Recent court decisions have resulted in the public

disclosure of electronic surveillance logs and related material

which heretofore were confidential. The information in these

surveillance matters is being afforded close scrutiny by the news

media, the general public, Federal, state, and local officials;

therefore, the importance of proper indexing has become

increasingly significant.

Each Special Agent in Charge will be held strictly

responsible for insuring that all names, nicknames, and aliases

appearing in electronic surveillance logs and related material

are properly indexed in accordance with the instructions set forth

in Part II, Section 3, page 4, of the Manual of Rules and Regulations.

(C) BANK PROTECTION ACT OF 1968 - BANK ROBBERY

MATTERS -- Regulations issued pursuant to the Bank Protection

Act of 1968 require that effective July 15, 1969, "bait" money be

maintained by banks and that the 'bait" money consist of used

Federal Reserve notes.

Some offices have in the past suggested to banks that

Federal Reserve notes issued in distant Federal Reserve districts

be used as "bait" bills in order to make 'bait" bills more noticeable.

For example, banks in Texas might use as "bait" money Federal

Reserve notes issued by the Federal Reserve in San Francisco

because few such bills will be in circulation in Texas.

The Federal Reserve System has advised that some of

the Federal Reserve Banks have recently been requested by

commercial banks to supply used currency from another Federal

Reserve district for use as 'bait" bills. The Federal Reserve

is not set up to handle these transactions and desires that banks

obtain used Federal Reserve notes issued in other districts

by contacting a correspondent bank rather than a Federal

Reserve Bank.

You should keep the above in mind when discussing

"bait" bills with bankers in your territory.

WASHINGTON, D.G. 205.35

August 13. 1969

(A) OMNIBUS CRIME CONTROL AND SAFE STREETS ACT OF 1968 --

Reference is made to SAC Letter 69-31 of June 3, 1969, captioned as

above.

.. Tape recordings of conversations deemed sufficiently pertinent to

monitor through electronic surveillances (elsurs) (wiretaps and micro-

phone surveillances) are to be made whenever feasible when coverage is...

authorized for intelligence purposes in the internal security field.

Particular effort should be made to record on tape the conversation of

an individual who is known to be a subject in a Federal criminal case.

Whenever the intercepted conversations clearly contain no

evidence or leads to evidence of criminal conduct, the tapes need not be

retained after they have served the needs of your office.

However, the

Department has pointed out that frequently it is required to disclose to

the court and sometimes to defense counsel recorded conversations of a

defendant in a Federal criminal case to refute the contention that infor-

mation relevant to that case was obtained through elsur.

Therefore, the

• Department has suggested that when an individual whose conversation is

being monitored is known by monitoring personnel or by the Special

Agent who prepares a summation of the conversation to be the subject

in a Federal criminal case, the taped recording or a verbatim transcript

of the conversation should be retained whenever possible.

The Department has further instructed that when an indiviudal

becomes a defendant in a Federal criminal case, every effort should be

made to avoid monitoring his conversations through elsurs. Equal effort

must be made to avoid monitoring any and all conversations of anyone

known to be serving as an attorney for a defendant in a Federal criminal

case. Therefore, whenever an elsur is operated in a substantive case

in which current or future prosecution in a Federal court is or may be

involved, monitoring should be conducted by a Special Agent or Special

Employee. The monitoring personnel must be instructed in writing that

they must immediately cease monitoring, both in person and by electronic

recording, any conversation as soon as it becomes clear that the parties

thereto are either a defendant or an attorney of a defendant in a Federal

criminal case.

NW 55069 DocId: 32989528 Page 782

---

## Page 783

It is recognized that it is impossible to make monitoring person-

nel aware of all defendants and their attorneys in all existing or

contemplated Federal criminal cases. Our efforts must be directed at

surviving the test of whether our approach was logical, reasonable, and

practical. It is logical and reasonable to expect that as a practical matter

our monitoring personnel should be aware of the identities of the defendants

and their attorneys in substantive cases where elsurs are being used and

prosecution is contemplated. To further insure that they do they must be

provided with a list of such defendants and their attorneys. They should

also be instructed that they must be alert not to monitor other individuals

in the same categories aside from the substantive case when there is

reasonable basis for the possible future contention that it was generally

publicly known that such individuals were involved in prosecutive action

in a Federal court.

The monitors should be instructed that in such situations they are

to make a notation in the log, as appropriate, that the conversation was

cut off and was not overheard, after identifying the name of the defendant

or attorney who was conversing which occasioned the cut-off. Further-

more, any time a conversation relating to defense strategy or tactics,

between any two persons, takes place, the conversation should be immedi-

ately cut off as soon as the subject matter of the conversation becomes

apparent. The same procedure should be followed with respect to

monitoring in other cases in which it may be reasonably expected calls

will be received from defendants or attorneys involved in current or

future prosecution.

If a conversation of a defendant or one of his attorneys should in-

advertently be overheard and later comes to the attention of a Special

Agent, that Special Agent shall immediately seal the record of the con-

versation, attaching a memorandum certifying that he has not and will

not orally or in writing relate the substance of the conversation to

any other representative of the Government or to anyone else except

upon order from the Attorney General. This sealed log and the Agent's

certification should immediately be forwarded to the Bureau for trans-

mittal to the appropriate Assistant Attorney General.

Elsur logs should be confined to: basic entries of dates, time,

identification of individual to monitored conversations; notification made

that monitoring ceased when one of the parties to the conversation was

recognized as a defendant in a pending Federal criminal case or an

attorney of such individual; identity of person monitoring; and identity

of reel number and location of the conversation on the reel.

Summations of contents of conversation are to be prepared only

by Special Agents after reviewing tapes, notes and logs, except in those

instances when a foreign language is involved. In such instances the

summations are to be prepared by personnel who handle foreign language

translations.

Indexing of names is to be made from the summation rather than

from the logs.

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

August 19, 1969

(A) CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS - ACCOMPLISHMENTS -- As you

are aware, many investigative demands are being made of the Bureau

necessitating the increased use of manpower. There is no indication

that this situation will abate. These increased responsibilities make it

mandatory that you devise procedures which will insure all matters within

our investigative jurisdiction are promptly and adequately investigated

followed by timely, well-organized presentations to United States

Attorneys.

During the past year with the change in the administration, many

new United States Attorneys and Assistant United States Attorneys have

been appointed. Others are being appointed on a continuing basis. It

is your responsibility to thoroughly indoctrinate new United States

Attorneys and their assistants. It is incumbent on you to stress the

desirability to prosecute all violations within our investigative jurisdic-

tion. You must closely follow the personnel situation not only in the

United States Attorneys' offices but also with regard to Federal judges.

In the event shortages or other situations exist which have an effect on

the handling of our cases, the Bureau should be immediately advised.

The Bureau's preeminence in the law enforcement field was built

on performance and results. Notwithstanding certain factors which at

first glance would seem to be beyond our control, I expect you to exert

every effort to insure our investigative record at the close of the current

fiscal year will withstand close scrutiny from any source.

(B) CIVIL DISORDERS - RIOTS AND DISTURBANCES -- Pursuant to

a Civil Disturbance Plan adopted by the Department of Justice, a Civil

Disturbance Group has been newly established in the Office of the

Deputy Attorney General to coordinate all activities connected with

civil disorders. One of its principal functions is the evaluation of

intelligence data in order for the Attorney General to make a judgment

as to the necessity for dispatching Departmental Civil Disorder Task

Forces to areas experiencing serious civil disorder. You were pre-

viously advised of the establishment of the Task Forces by airtel to all

SACs dated May 8, 1969, captioned "Departmental Civil Disorder Task

Forces. "

The Department is fully dependent upon the FBI for the collec-

tion and prompt reporting of intelligence data related to threatened or

actual civil disorders. It is also dependent upon the Bureau for assist-

ance in evaluating intelligence data regarding developing situations

having a potential for violence. It is absolutely essential, therefore:

that the Bureau be immediately notified by the most expeditious means

warranted by the urgency of the circumstances of any outbreak of civil

disorder or situations which threaten to expand into mob violence or

riots.

In those instances where the Bureau is initially notified by tele-

phone, a confirming teletype setting forth the available details must be

submitted within the hour and in a form suitable for dissemination. The

Bureau must be kept fully informed of all subsequent pertinent develop-

ments. by teletype, or by telephone followed by teletype if the informa-

tion or circumstances so warrant.

I wish to reiterate that in order for the Bureau to carry out its

responsibilities in this extremely critical field, a constant and effective

check on existing conditions which may lead to riots or mob violence

must be maintained. School and campus disorders and the activities of

racial and other types of extremists must be considered in this regard.

To accomplish this coverage, full utilization of informants and in-depth

liaison with local law enforcement agencies is essential.

I am holding each SAC personally responsible to see that the

above instructions are fully complied with and to insure that law en-

forcement agencies in his Division fully understand the importance of the

FBI being immediately notified of any threatened or actual outbreak of

civil disorder. Any delay whatsoever in reporting data in this area to

the Bureau will not be tolerated.

(C) INFILTRATION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE

AGENCIES BY BLACK EXTREMIST GROUPS - RACIAL MATTERS --

Information has recently been developed by the Washington Field Office

that a black extremist leader indicated he had been thinking of recruiting

young black people into his organization with the thought that they could

be infiltrated into the FBI and/or CIA. There is no indication that such

a program had been implemented.

This again highlights the ever present danger of infiltration of

the ranks of our employees. As you are aware, our investigations and

system of operation are geared to uncover any "plant"; however, we

must never lose sight of this possibility, since penetration of law

enforcement agencies is a priority target of these extremist groups.

All Bureau Agents should be alert for information indicating

that infiltration as outlined above is being considered or is taking place.

During contacts with informants, this matter should be pursued to

determine if they have any information regarding infiltration by

extremist groups into the FBI, other intelligence agencies, and local

law enforcement. Advise the Bureau promptly of any information

developed.

The next Black Nationalist Movement semiannual report which

is due 9/10/69 and all subsequent reports should contain all information

developed including contacts with sources and informants regarding

this matter. The results should be set forth under above caption as

Section VI of the report.

(A) VOUCHERS - MOVING EXPENSES - BUREAU OF THE BUDGET

CIRCULAR A-56 REVISED JUNE 26, 1969 -- Bureau of the Budget has

issued revised regulations governing additional benefits provided by

= Public Law 89-516, approved July 21, 1966, for employees who are

officially transterred. The revised regulations were effective as of June

26, 1969, and are not retroactive prior to that date. A copy of the re-

vised regulations is attached and additional copies in the form of inserts

to the Voucher Guide will be forwarded to your office in the near future.

A summary of the pertinent changes together with the Bureau's

regulations thereon follows:

OVERSEAS TRAVEL OF DEPENDENTS

If a member of an employee's immediate family reaches his 21st

birthday while the employee is stationed overseas and the Government

paid the cost of his transportation to the overseas station when the

employee was transferred, such member may be returned to the United

States at Government expense provided the return travel is performed

within the prescribed time limitation. Heretofore the regulations

prohibited the travel of such member of the employee's immediate family

at Government cost.

COMPUTATION OF PER DIEM

An employee traveling on transfer, or traveling to or from an

overseas duty station on home leave, or returning to his place of resi-

dence in the United States from an overseas duty station for separation,

is now entitled to a claim of per diem regardless of the fact that the

travel time for the trip is less than ten hours. Members of the employee's

immediate family traveling with the employee under these conditions are

also entitled to a claim of per diem. The previous regulations contained

NW 55069 DocId: 32989528

Page 788

---

## Page 789

a ten-hour restriction with respect to the computation of per diem. It

is desired to point out that the elimination of the ten-hour rule does not

apply when travel is incidental to temporary duty. Each per diem claim

under this regulation must be supported by a statement to the effect that

additional expenses were incurred.

TEMPORARY QUARTERS ALLOWANCES (TIME)

The revised regulation extends the period of time during which

the employee may begin his temporary quarters allowance. The

temporary quarters claim must begin not later than 30 days from the

date the employee reported for duty at the new station or it not begun

during this period, then not later than 30 days from the date the family

vacated the residence at the old station. Previously the 30-day rule for

the starting time of a temporary quarters claim did not include the

condition for the extension of time relating to the family vacating the

residence at the old station.

RECEIPT REQUIREMENT FOR TEMPORARY QUARTERS EXPENSES

Receipts are required for lodging, laundry and cleaning expenses

(except when coin-operated machines are used for laundering and/or

cleaning of clothes). The previous regulations did not specify the

requirement for receipts to support expenses incurred for laundry and

cleaning of clothes.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION

SETTLEMENT DATES

The new regulations now provide for an additional condition

wherein the period of time for the settlement dates on a real estate

transaction may be extended. An additional period of time not in excess

of one year may be authorized or approved by the agency when it is

determined that circumstances justifying the exception exist which

precluded settlement within the initial one-year period of the sale and/or

purchase contract entered into in good faith by the employee during the

initial one-year period. All circumstances used to justify the extension

of time must be set forth in writing. The extension of time will only be

granted in those cases where all facts show that the employee entered

8/26/69

SAC LETTER 69-45

- 2 -

NW 55069 Docid: 32989528 Page 789

---

## Page 790

into a sale or purchase contract which would have allowed sufficient

time under normal conditions for the transaction to have been completed

within the initial one-year period of time. Each employee's voucher.

submitted for real estate transaction expenses wherein the settlement

dates extend beyond the one-year initial time period must be supported

by a statement of information from the employee concerning the causes

for the delay and forwarded to the Bureau with your personal recommen-

dations concerning the merits involved in the case.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION REIMBURSABLE EXPENSES

Several changes have been made to clarify various types of

expenses that are now proper for reimbursement. The cost of a title

insurance policy and legal and related expenses for a title opinion are

now reimbursable. The same types of expenses incurred in both the

sale and purchase transactions are now reimbursable; whereas,

heretofore they were restricted to either the sale or purchase transaction

but not both. The new regulations eliminate as reimbursable the cost

incurred by the employee in obtaining a loan for the purchase of a

dwelling and also prohibits reimbursement to the employee for expenses

that are determined to be a part of the financial cost under the Truth

and-Lending Act (Public Law 90-321).

isu

Appropriate manual changes will be forthcoming.

(B) ASCERTAINING FINANCIAL ABILITY MATTERS -- Your attention

is directed to SAC Letter 69-39 dated 7/22/69 setting the minimum

acceptance amount in Ascertaining Financial Ability (AFA) cases at

$1,500. At the request of the Criminal Division of the Department an

exception is being made concerning referrals for AFA investigations in

connection with criminal fine and appearance bond judgments and the

minimum in these cases is being set at $500. Request for investigation

of criminal fines and appearance bonds involving smaller amounts may

be accepted should a special situation exist. Of course, the $1, 500

minimum acceptance amount will remain in eftect relative to all other

requests for AFA investigations. The Department is in the process of

issuing advice to all U. S. Attorneys.

Appropriate Manual and Agent Handbook changes are forthcoming.

(A) INFORMANTS - CRIMINAL, RACIAL AND SECURITY -- Your

attention is again directed to the urgent necessity to exercise the utmost

care and discretion in the selection of individuals for development as

informants. There must be greater stress placed on this important

phase of your informant programs.

Keep in mind that any doubt regarding a potential informant's

emotional stability or veracity should be immediately resolved in the

best interests of the Bureau.

You should afford continuous strong supervision through all

steps of the development and handling of informants. There is like-

wise a need for tight supervision of Agent personnel engaged in the

handling of informants to insure all actions taken are proper and above

criticism. Under no circumstances should tavors or gratuities be

accepted from informants or any other action be taken which could

compromise the Special Agent involved or the Bureau.

Any deviation from these instructions will not be tolerated.

Your efforts to obtain adequate informant coverage must be

characterized by good judgment on the part of all Special Agents.

These instructions in no way lessen your responsibility to

insure your office has a continuous and well-planned program to expand

your informant coverage.

Appropriate personnel should be advised with respect to

these instructions.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

(A) •PAYMENTS TO INFORMANTS - CRIMINAL, RACIAL, AND

SECURITY -- There have been too many instances recently where

the field has requested exorbitant lump-sum payments to informants.

I want immediate positive steps taken to insure that all future

requests are more careiully scrutinized and cut down to a reason-

able and proper level. As you have been instructed in the past, it

is the responsibility of each SAC to closely examine informant

payment requests submitted. It is apparent that scrutiny by you

of lump-sum payment requests has not received adequate. attention.

Unless payments to informants are maintained at reasonable levels

there will have to be a material reduction in the number of incentive

awards made to our own personnel. You are expected to bring this

to the attention of all personnel handling informants, and it will be

incumbent upon you to see that these instructions are closely followed

in the future.

Very truly yours,

(A) CONDUCT DURING INTERVIEWS -- It is recognized that Spécial

Agents often conduct interviews with persons who deliberately become

obnoxious and may go out of their way to irritate and provoke the

Agents. Even under such trying circumstances Agents should remain

calm and in complete control of their speech in order to avoid the use

of any provocative language that a reasonable person could consider

to be offensive.

These observations are to be brought to the attention of

all investigative personnel.

(B) SECURITY AND RACIAL INFORMANTS -- A recent survey conducted

by the Inspection Division of informants and sources on the campuses of

educational institutions determined that there exists a need for tight controls

and great selectivity in this most sensitive area.

Accordingly, no student should be developed as a campus security

or racial informant or source of any type in security or racial matters who

is under the age of 21. In the event there exist highly unusual circumstances

which would warrant an exception, you should submit such a request to the

Bureau setting out full justification.

Upon initial contact with a potential student informant or source,

informant or source should be requested to execute a brief signed written

statement for the field file to the effect that such individual has voluntarily

furnished information to the FBI because of his concern of individuals and

groups acting against the interests of his government and that he understands

that the FBI is not interested in the legitimate activities of educational

institutions.

• Also, you will submit a quarterly letter regarding each student

or teacher authorized for contact as a potential informant, informant or panel

source in security and racial matters.

This letter should contain details

regarding productivity, citing specific information furnished by the source not

otherwise available to your office from public source material or other avail-

able sources off campus. Sufficient information must be contained in this

letter to justify the continued utilization of the source.

The initial quarterly letters should be submitted by each office

by January 1, 1970, and should be transmitted to the Bureau by cover com-

munication under the caption "Utilization of Informants and Sources at

Institutions of Learning." The cover communication should set forth an over-

all analysis of coverage afforded by campus sources in each division including

the number of informants and sources active and under development at each

educational institution where sources are being utilized. Subsequent letters

should be submitted in a like manner on a quarterly basis.

Requests for payments should not be included in these quarterly

letters. Rules governing such requests remain unchanged and will continue

to be the subject of separate communications.

These instructions in no way lessen your responsibility to insure

that your office has a continuous and well-planned program to obtain neces-

sary coverage at institutions of learning so that the Bureau can fulfill its

obligations.

Appropriate manual and handbook changes are forthcoming.

(A) FIREARMS - REMINGTON MODEL 760 PUMP-ACTION RIFLES

AND CARBINES -- Each office will soon be supplied with .308 caliber

Remington Model 760 pump-action rifles and carbines, some equipped

with 4-power telescopic sights, carrying slings, and carrying cases.

The cases may also be used for transporting shotguns and machine

guns. The action of the Remington Model 760 rifle and carbine is

identical with that of the Remington Model 870 shotgun which will

simplify training with the new weapon. You will be furnished a supply

of 150 grain, metal-cased, • 308 ammunition for service use. For

training purposes you will receive a supply of reduced velocity

ammunition, appropriately color-coded, which will permit training

on your present pistol range. A training bulletin regarding this new

weapon will be forwarded in the near future.

Each SAC will immediately advise the Bureau, Attention:

Training Division, the number of Remington Model 81 rifles in his

office, listing by caliber and serial number the condition of each:

excellent, good, or fair. Also advise the number of carrying cases

for the Model 81 rifle and the amount of Remington. 30 or .35 caliber

ammunition on hand.

(B) SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION CHARACTERIZATION - AMERICAN

SERVICEMEN'S UNION - Set forth below is an up-to-date characteri-

zation of the American Servicemen's Union (ASU) which is believed to

have field-wide application.

On September 20, 1969, a source advised that the ASU,

formed during early 1968, maintains headquarters at 156 Fifth Avenue,

New York, New York. ASU is dominated and controlled by the

Workers World Party (WWP) and is designed to advance WWP efforts

to undermine United States political and military objectives abroad

by fomenting discontent among military enlisted personnel and by

calling for the establishment of a servicemen's union. ASU's chief

propaganda weapon is the publication of "The Bond - The Servicemen's

Newspaper" which is widely circulated at military installations free

of charge and at times unsolicited.

: The source also advised that the ASU's Chairman is Andrew

Dean Stapp, undesirably discharged from the United States Army in

April, 1968. Stapp is a member of the WWP. ASU and "'The Bond"

are terms used interchangeably in connection with WWP interests in

military matters. The former has no real existence apart from the

latter since the publication is the primary means of generating interest

among and communicating with servicemen interested in the formation

of a union. The Union does not function as an organization at this

time. It has, however, been given much publicity in each edition of

"The Bond."

A characterization of the WWP as set out on page

44 of SAC Letter 69-50 dated September 19, 1969,

will be used in conjunction with the above

characterization.

(A) SECURITY INFORMANT AND RACIAL INFORMANT PROGRAMS -

REDUCTION IN COST -- The value of productive live informants in the

security and racial fields cannot be overemphasized and in this connection

I want to stress that there are many areas where informant coverage is in-

adequate or weak. However, in an effort to cope with an ever-increasing

cost of our operations, particularly in the payments to informants for

services and expenses, i want each special Agent in Charge to undertake

a detailed analysis of his individual security and racial informant programs

in an effort to determine if there are any ways in which savings may be

effected through retrenchment, refinement and/or elimination of duplication

of effort.

In approaching this problem, each Special Agent in Charge is

urged to be both critical and constructive. You should consider what is

necessary to your efficient operations as opposed to what is desirable. How-

ever, it is expected that the productivity of each and every informant will

be taken into account, bearing in mind that in some instances the primary

value of an informant is to provide corroboration of intelligence received

from other informants. While a system of corroborating information provided

by other informants is essential in determining the validity of our data and the

integrity of newly developed informants and sources, and may be the desirable

manner of cross-checking information, it may be that in some instances back-

up informants are being continued for corroborative purposes even though

integrity and reliability of other primary sources of the same information

have been established.

Such practice leans more to the desirable maximum

coverage rather than the more economical necessary coverage and wherever

possible should be eliminated or curtailed.

This is not to suggest that justified payments to established,

productive informants should be arbitrarily reduced in order to achieve savings;

nor should you arbitrarily discontinue informants who may occasionally fur-

nish duplicate or corroborative information but for the most part produce

valuable first-hand intelligence. In particular you should not curtail your

NW 55069

DocId: 3299528

Page 800

---

## Page 801

informant program as such, although it is recognized that in order to

accomplish a reduction in expenses it may be necessary for you to cut back

the total number of informants being operated by your office in the security

field. Each office should place stress on quality over quantity in evaluating

its informant coverage. In some instances informants being paid on a regular

basis may have authorized amounts reduced to more realistic figures. Other

informants might logically be reduced to the status of confidential sources,

while still others might be discontinued entirely, subject of course to being

reinstated if the circumstances so dictate. Discontinuance of such informants

should of course be accomplished in such a manner that should the need arise,

they may be reactivated.

You should also consider the possibility of redirecting efforts

of any informant whose services, while desirable in one field, may be more

valuable in another area where there is inadequate coverage.

Such redirection

might result in a decrease in activity with an accompanying decrease in the

amount paid to him for services and/or expenses.

It is recognized that of necessity there will be an abrupt decrease

in informant statistics because of cutbacks in the overall informant strength.

However, I feel that this will be more than offset by projected savings which

will be realized and this will be fully taken into account during inspections of

your office. Cutbacks in individual situations must not result in a letdown on the

part of each individual Agent in his continuing search for well-qualified security

and racial informants and participation by each Special Agent in this important

program will also continue to be examined by the inspection staff.

Within thirty days from the date of this letter each office must

submit to the Bureau by letter captioned "SECURITY AND RACIAL INFOR-

MANT COVERAGE - REDUCTION IN COST" overall results of its detailed

analysis together with its recommendations for measures which will result

in savings in informant costs in the office. Your letter should identify each

case by title and Bureau file number, wherein savings can be effected, to-

gether with the projected savings and the effect the measure will have on

your informant program. This letter must be immediately followed by

separate letters for individual case files of informants affected. In addition

to recommendation for discontinuance, redirection, reduction in status,

reduction in authorized payments or other action, each letter must specifically

comment as to the possibility of reactivation of discontinued informants

should the need arise and whether the informant offers any potential for re-

direction in another field where informant coverage is weak or inadequate.

(B) MEDICARE - MEDICAID - FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT --

In recent months considerable publicity has appeared in various parts

of the country concerning large-scale frauds and other abuses by doctors,

dentists, hospitals and nursing homes in connection with the operation of

Medicare and Medicaid programs. These abuses relate to alleged mis-

management by state authorities, charges for services not rendered,

inflated fees, double billings, charges for unnecessary services and

services to ineligible patients. In order to insure uniform handling by

the field of complaints received concerning the operations of these programs,

and to avoid duplication of investigation, the following is being set forth.

Medicare is a Federal program enacted July 30, 1965, to provide

hospital and medical insurance to persons over 65 years of age and is

available all over the United States. This insurance program is financed

by monthly premiums and is administered by the Social Security

Administration. Fraudulent claims submitted under this program would

be a violation of Title 42, U. S. Code, Section 408 (Section 208 of the

Social Security Act), which as a general rule would take precedence over

the general criminal fraud statutes.

The Social Security Administration has an investigative staff and

has primary responsibility for the administration of Social Security Act

benefits, including the Medicare program. Recent irregularities brought

to light concerning this program have been investigated by the Social

Security Administration.

In view of the foregoing; any complaints received by the field con-

cerning possible frauds or other abuses in the operation of the Medicare

program should be referred to the nearest local office of the Social Security

Administration without any investigation.

Medicaid is a grant-in-aid program in which Federal and state

(and sometimes local) governments share the costs of medical care for

people with low income. States design their own programs within Federal

guidelines and benefits vary from state to state. The Department of

Health, Education, and Welfare is responsible for the administration of

the program on the Federal level, whereas state agencies have this

responsibility on a local level. Any complaints received concerning alleged

irregularities in connection with this program should be submitted to the

nearest local office of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare

without investigation.

The foregoing should be brought to the attention of all investi-

gative personnel.

(C) INVESTIGATION OF UNAFFILIATED WHITE RACIAL EXTREMISTS -

RACIAL MATTERS -- Under existing instructions, investigation of white

extremists is restricted to those individuals who are associated with the

Klan or other white hate-type organizations. In view of the recent marked

increase in violent acts throughout the United States on the part of indi-

viduals who are not affiliated with the Klan or other white hate-type

organizations, it is necessary to modify existing instructions to broaden

the scope of our investigative responsibilities to include these unaffiliated

individuals.

Investigation has established that many of the individuals

involved in these recent acts of violence, although not currently members

of the Klan or other white hate-type groups, did have previous affiliation

with such groups and still maintain their extremist tendencies.

Hereafter, investigation must be promptly instituted on these

unaffiliated white racial extremists and their activities closely followea.

In conducting these investigations, you should be guided by instruc-

tions set out in Section 122A, Volume IV, Manual of Instructions, which

apply to investigations of the Klan and white hate-type organizations and

associated individuals. Appropriate manual and handbook revisions will

be forthcoming.

John Edgar Hoover

descriptive and identification data concerning the individual,

such as social security number, military service number,

operator's license number; date and place of birth, aliases,

and physical description.

Check at Bureau will include

fugitive indices, NCIC, and Identification Division records.

Whenever possible, inquiry should be worded, "Advise only

if fugitive or wanted, " to avoid need for negative reply. If

circumstances exist necessitating an answer, specifically

indicate this by stating, "Advise whether or not fugitive or

wanted. " Avoid ambiguous language, such as, "Advise if

fugitive" or "Advise if wanted." Such requests will be

interpreted to mean, "Advise only if fugitive or wanted."

In instances in which the field requires an answer to its

inquiry of whether an individual is a Bureau fugitive or is

wanted by local authorities, one additional copy of the

airtel or letter should be submitted to Bureau for each

office which should be advised. If there is no record as

wanted, the Bureau will appropriately stamp copy of the

incoming communication and forward same to interested

offices by routing slip.

b. Initial entry of fugitive records

All entries will be made at SOG. (Local agency NCIC terminals are

(B) IMPREST FUNDS - AUDIT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 1969 -- Treasury

Department regulations require that at the close of the period covered by

a surety bond on Imprest Fund Cashiers, the cash in the hands of Cashiers

or Alternate Cashiers be verified by two disinterested persons, designated

for this purpose by the Special Agent in Charge, and that a report of the

same be submitted to the Chief Disbursing Officer of the Treasury Depart-

ment.

The surety bond presently covering our Cashiers and Alternate

Cashiers was executed for a two-year period, which will expire at the

close of business, December 31, 1969. Accordingly, it will be necessary

for you to designate two disinterested employees to audit the Imprest Fund

of your office on December 31, 1969. Form FD-301 should be executed in

an original and two copies and signed by the individuals making the audit.

The original and one copy should be forwarded to the Bureau, attention

"Budget Unit." This audit cannot be made on any other day, nor can one of

the semiannual audits be used for the purpose.. You are not to interpret this

as eliminating or superseäing either of the semiannual audits. This is an

audit which must be made every two years in addition to any other audits

that are required to be made. The original of this audit report will have to be

forwarded to a different branch of the Treasury Department than that to which

the regular semiannual reports are sent. Also, it is desired to stress

that both of the individuals making the audit must sign the report.

(C) TRAINING - POLICE - ASSIGNMENT OF INSTRUCTORS -- I am

concerned that sufficient care is not being used in the assignment of

police instructors in field schools to insure the most effective use of

our available manpower. Our investigative commitments have never

been as heavy, and I want you to carefully review the manner in which

your police instructors are assigned to avoid the use of an excessive

number of different instructors in any police school commitment. This

should be accomplished by assigning instructor personnel to handle

multiple topics unless some strong reason makes this impossible, such

as when specialized topics are involved.

(D) SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION CHARACTERIZATION - TRI-

CONTINENTAL INFORMATION CENTER -- Set forth below is an up-

to-date characterization of the Tri-Continental Information Center

which replaces the one in SAC Letter 69-50.

A source advised on February 18, 1967, that it was announced

at an Executive Board meeting of the Communist Party of Minneapolis,

Minnesota, in 1967, that Mike Myerson was forming an anti-imperialist

center. This center became known as the Tri-Continental Information

Center (TCIC) and maintained an office in Room 640, 1133 Broadway,

New York City.

A second source advised on May 11, 1967, that the TCIC was

founded by Mike Myerson, who attended a Communist Party, USA,

National Committee meeting in June, 1967, in New York City, as a

Communist Party front organization supported by Communist Party

funds.

The TCIC was described in Volume I, Number 1, May, 1967,

issue of the "Tri-Continental Information Center Bulletin" as an

organization established to raise, through education and information, an

anti-imperialist consciousness in the United States--particularly within

the growing movements for peace, human rights and democracy.

A third source advised on September 26, 1969, the TCIC was

considered defunct as of that time.

(C) FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY TRAVEL AND SUBSISTENCE ALLOW-

ANCES -- As you were advised by SAC Letter 68-47(A), travel and

subsistence expenses were made available under the Omnibus Crime

Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 for local law enforcement officers

from the United States attending the FBI National Academy. Officers

attending in Fiscal Year 1970 received travel and $16 per day subsistence

allowances from the regular FBI appropriations.

Since we assist officers in obtaining housing accommodations

and encourage them to share expenses while attending the National

Academy, we feel that the $16 a day allowance is sufficient at the present

time to handle their expenses while in Washington. The most recent

National Academy class felt that $16 a day was sufficient to handle their

expenses. We will, of course, reevaluate this matter from time to time

and in the event there is any change, you will be advised.

The $16 a day per diem rate will apply to any other officers

attending FBI-sponsored schools in Washington, D. C., wherein travel

and subsistence allowances are authorized.

(D) TITLE III OF THE OMNIBUS CRIME CONTROL AND SAFE STREETS

ACT OF 1968 -- A review of the use of court-approved electronic surveil-

lance pursuant to Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets

Act of 1968 shows that excellent results have been obtained through

coverage of carefully selected locations.

This legal evidence-gathering technique has been effectively

utilized in organized crime investigations, particularly those relating to

loan-sharking and gambling operations.

For example, just one operation revealed those in control

were handling $60, 000, 000 per year principally in lay-off action. In

another instance, data from electronic surveillance enabled the Bureau

to conduct 51 fruitful search-warrant raids involving an extensive

interstate gambling operation.

Insure Agent personnel handling investigations in connection

with the Criminal Intelligence Program and other major criminal investiga-

tions are thoroughly familiar with all aspects of Title Ill. They should be

continually alert to the possibility of requesting use of this most effective

investigative technique.

As you know, it is mandatory that probable cause be established

prior to approval of use of electronic surveillance. An analysis of affidavits

which have been approved requesting use of electronic surveillance reveals

that top echelon informants and other sources have made substantial contribu-

tions in establishing probable cause. Keep in mind informants can be of

material assistance in this regard.

In the event you have a specific situation presenting a special

problem with respect to use of electronic surveillance, communicate with

the Bureau.

It is your responsibility to make certain that whenever special

circumstances are existent which completely justily use of electronic

surveillance pursuant to Title III, appropriate action is taken by your office.

In addition, there is set out below a characterization of the

Student National Coordinating Committee, which should be

mentioned SAC Letter.

REPUBLIC OF NEW AFRICA

A source has advised that the Republic of

New Africa (RNA) is an all-Negro organization founded

in Detroit, Michigan, in March, 1968. Robert F. Williams,

who was then residing in Peking, China, was named as its

President-in-Exile.

Williams fled the United States in

1961 following issuance of a local warrant for his

arrest on a charge of kidnapping growing out of a racial

incident in Monroe, North Carolina. He published and

broadcast hate-type material in Cuba and China prior

to his return to the United States in September, 1969.

A second source has advised that the purpose of the

RNA is to establish an independent black nation within the

United States, demanding the States of Alabama, Georgia,

Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina in addition to $10,000

per black citizen as payment for 400 years of. ancestral slave

labor.

A third source advised on March 14, 1969, that an

army of the RNA, known as the Black Legion, dedicated to black

freedom and committed to the concept of systematic armed

revolution, has been established. Black Legion members are

expected to participate in military training and engage in

firearms practice.

The RNA plans to establish an underground

Black Legion in addition to an aboveground Black Legion in

order to avoid detection by the police.

REVOLUTIONARY ACTION MOVEMENT

.. A source in November, 1964, made available a document

which indicated that the Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM) was

organized in 1963 by Afro-Americans who supported the revolutionary

objectives of Robert F. Williams and his concept of organized

violence to achieve the liberation of Afro-American people in

the United States.

Williams fled the United States in 1961 following

issuance of a local warrant for his arrest on a charge of

kidnapping growing out of a racial incident in Monroe,

North Carolina. He published and broadcast hate-type

material in Cuba and China prior to his return to the

United States in September, 1969.

According to this document, RAM oriented its

program to education, political revolution and the organization

of a black political

party with revolutionary objectives, recog-

nizing the need for "black revolution" that could and would

seize power.

This source in September, 1964, advised that RAM

is dedicated to the overthrow of the capitalistic system in the

United States, by violence if necessary, and to its replacement

by a socialistic system oriented toward the Chinese Communist

interpretation of Marxism-Leninism.

including the state crime of Advocacy of Criminal Anarchy.

City had been its main sphere of activity.

STUDENT NATIONAL COORDINATING COMMITTEE

A source advised the Student National Coordinating

Committee (SNCC), formerly known as the Student Nonviolent

Coordinating Committee, is a nonmembership organization founded

in 1960, during the civil rights movement in the South.

Under the leadership of Stokely Carmichael, who served

as National Chairman during the period 1966-67, SNCC evolved from

a civil rights oriented group into a full-blown black revolutionary

organization.

A publication entitled "1967 High Tide of Black

Resistance" indicates the year 1967 was considered by 'SNCC as a

historic milestone for the liberation of black people in the

United 'States and the year that revolutionaries throughout the

world began to understand more fully the impact of the black

movement. The publication declared that "liberation will come

only when there is final destruction of this mad octopus--the

capitalistic system of the United States with all its life-

sucking tentacles of exploitation and racism that choke the

people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The realities of

black life, together with the recognition instilled in SNCC

workers, forced its members to further popularize the legitimacy

of self-defense and rebellions when oppression became too great."

A second source advised that H. Rap Brown succeeded

Carmichael as National Chairman of SNCC in May, 1968, and served

in that capacity until June, 1968, at which time SNCC reorganized,

creating ten deputy chairmen in an effort to relieve pressure by

law enforcement.

In April, 1969, SNCC moved its national headquarters

from Atlanta, Georgia, to New York City, where it is presently

located.

H. Rap Brown announced at a press conference in

New York City on July 22, 1969, that he had been elected

Chairman of the Student Nonvioleni Couruinating Committee.

He announced the organization was dropping the word

"Nonviolent" from its title and will be known as the

Student National Coordinating Committee, with a Revolutionary

Political Council functioning as its governing body. Brown,

at that time, stated the use of force is necessary in obtaining

revolutionary goals.

(F) STUDENTS FOR/A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY - SUBVERSIVE

ORGANIZATION CHARACTERIZATION -- Set forth below is a current

characterization of Students for a Democratic Society which should be

utilized in the future when it is necessary to characterize this

organization in investigative reports and other types of communications.

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the Students for a Democratic

Society (SDS), as presently regarded, came into being at a founding

convention held June, 1962, at Port Huron, Michigan. From an initial

posture of "participatory democracy" the line of the national leadership

has revealed a growing Marxist-Leninist adherence which currently

calls for the building of a revolutionary youth movement. Concurrently,

the program of SDS has evolved from civil rights struggles to an anti-

Vietnam war stance to an advocacy of a militant anti-imperialist position.

China, Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as the leaders of worldwide

struggles against United States imperialism whereas the Soviet Union

is held to be revisionist and also imperialist.

At the June, 1969, SDS National Convention, Progressive

Labor Party (PLP) forces in the organization were expelled. As a

result, the National Office (NO) group maintained its National Head-

quarters at 1608 West Madison Street, Chicago, and the PLP faction

set up headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This headquarters

subsequently moved to Boston. Each group elected its own national

officers, which include three national secretaries and a National

Interim Committee of eight. Both the NO forces and the PLP forces

claim to be the true SDS. Both groups also print their versions of

"New Left Notes" which sets forth the line and the program of the

particular faction. The NO version of "New Left Notes" was recently

printed under the title "The Fire Next Time" to achieve a broader mass

appeal.

Two major factions have developed internally within the

NO group, namely, the Weatherman or Revolutionary Youth Movement

(RYM) I faction, and the RYM II faction. Weatherman is action-oriented

upholding Castro's position that the duty of revolutionaries is to make

revolution. Weatherman is regarded by RYM Il as an adventuristic,

12/9/69

SAC LETTER 69-73

- 10 -

NW 55069 DocId: 32989528 Page 823

---

## Page 824

elitist faction which denies the historical role of the working class as

the base for revolution. RYM II maintains that revolution, although

desired, is not possible under present conditions, hence emphasizes

organizing and raising the political consciousness of the working class

upon whom they feel successful revolution depends. Although disclaiming

control and domination by the Communist Party, USA, leaders in these two

factions have in the past proclaimed themselves to be communists and

to follow the precepts of a Marxist-Leninist philosophy, along pro-

• Chinese communist lines.

A second source has advised that the PLP faction which

is more commonly known as the Worker Student Alliance is dominated

and controlled by members of the PLP, who are required to identify

themselves with the pro-Chinese Marxist-Leninist philosophy of the

PLP. They advocate that an alliance between workers and students

is vital to the bringing about of a revolution in the United States.

SDS regions and university and college chapters, although

operating under the outlines of the SDS National Constitution, are

autonomous in nature and free to carry out independent policy reflective

of local conditions.

Because of this autonomy internal struggles

reflecting the major factional interests of SDS have occurred at the

chapter level since the beginning of the 1969-70 school year.

A characterization of PLP is attached.

until maturity at the original 5% rate. It further advises that the interest

rate for Series E Bonds, effective June 1, 1969, has been increased from

4z to 5%.

Revived by so. fals

In the immediate future you will be furnished a list of all

the employees of your office who are now purchasing Freedom Share

Notes. These employees should be personally contacted and advised

that with the first pay period beginning in January, 1970, no deductions

will be made from their salary for Freedom Share Notes after full

purchase price for a Note has been completed. Unless the employee

cancels the authorization in writing, deductions presently authorized for

the combined Freedom Share Note-Series E Bond will be automatically

converted to a deduction for a Series E Bond only. A Series E Bond

will then be issued in a denomination equal to the combined face value

of the Series E Bond and the Freedom Share Note. The amount deducted

will be adjusted accordingly. For example, if an employee is having

$39 withheld for one $25 Series E Bond and for one $25 Freedom Share

Note, the amount of $37.50 will be withheld for one $50 Bond.

The

inscription on the $50 Bond will be identical to that on the previous $25

Bond.

Employees now purchasing Freedom Share Notes who do not

desire the automatic conversion to Series E Bonds only should forward

a signed request to cancel their present authorization no later than

(C) BRIBERY AND CRIMINAL FRAUD INVESTIGATIONS -- This'is to again

bring to your attention the necessity of affording Bribery, Fraud Against

the Government, Federal Housing Administration Matters and Veterans

Administration Matters continuous, preferred and thorough investigative

and supervisory attention. Increased federally financed programs

dealing with poverty, housing, employment, training and education have

placed added investigative demands on the Bureau in recent months. In

addition, there has been a noticeable increase in large procurement type

frauds requiring substantial investigative activity on the part of Bureau

Agents.

Fraud and corruption growing out of Government procurements

and other federally sponsored programs affect the proper and efficient

functioning of the Federal Government, its Departments and Agencies

and cast suspicion on the integrity of Government employees. These

so-called "white-collar crimes" are most serious and usually generate

intense interest by the public, the press and Congress. Other Departments.

and Agencies have administrative responsibilities to perform when alleged

violations relate to their personnel or the management of their contracts

and they frequently withhold administrative action pending receipt of the

results of the Bureau's completed investigations. Consequently, it is

most essential that there be no delay by the Bureau in fulfilling its

responsibilities in these cases.

You are reminded that the field's responsibilities are not

ended with the completion of investigations. There must be prompt, full

and well-organized presentations to the United States Attorneys.

Cases

warranting prosecutive consideration must be closely followed with the ..

United States Attorneys to insure that there is no delay in prosecuting

worthy cases. Unnecessary delays either in the investigative or

prosecutive stages can be most embarrassing to the Government and can

seriously jeopardize chances for successful prosecution.

It is desired that you make an immediate, thorough analysis

of the present administrative and investigative handling of these matters

to insure that there is no delay in the initiation and completion of our

investigations of Bribery and Criminal Fraud allegations. Supervisory

and investigative personnel should be made aware of the Bureau's concern

in this regard. The handling of these important matters will continue

to be closely scrutinized at the Seat of Government to insure these in-

structions are fully complied with.

total of 4,213 appointments were offered, 3, 106 clerks entered on duty

and 1, 10% appointments were declined. The percentage of declination

was 26.3%. Reasons given are set forth below.

This survey disclosed no significant changes in the reasons for

declinations as compared to similar surveys conducted in the past. It

demonstrates the absolute necessity of insuring that before an applicant

is placed under investigation, you must be assured that he is sincerely

interested in employment by the Bureau at Washington, D. C.

In view of the great demands already placed on our investigative

personnel, it is essential that appointments are kept at the highest level

of acceptance. Through gonetrative interviews people who have no interest

in Bureau employment of who have not given sufficient thought to all the

ramifications involved in seeking employment away from home will be

weeded out. As you have been previously advised, contacting the parents

of young applicants tu insure that they will allow the applicant to come to

Washington results in a saving of investigative time and cuts down con-

siderably on the number oi declinations. You should use this technique

in any instance where it appears that parental approval has not been given

to the applicant.

offered as much as six months in advance of the applicant's availability

date; therefore, you should as soon as possible begin the recruitment and

investigation of those applicants who will be available following May and

June graduation. In order to insure expedite processing of the 1970

graduates, the exact graduation date of the applicant as well as his

availability date should be set forth on the Interview Report Form

(FD-190). If exact date is not known to applicant, determine how many

days he will need following graduation prior to reporting for employment

at Seat of Government. During course of investigation in those instances

(E) E'BI DISASTER SQUAD ACTIVITIES - The FBI Disaster Squad has

rendered identification assistance in numerous disasters and, because of

the large repository of fingerprints in the Identification Division, has been

successful in identifying many victims through fingerprints. The number

of fingerprint identifications made is governed by the availability of known

fingerprints for the victims coupled with the condition of the remains.

Eighty per cent of the disasters in which the Disaster Squad has par-

ticipated involved aircraft accidents. With the advent of jet aircraft,

the percentage of fingerprint identifications has declined because of

severe incineration and mutilation of the remains. In some aircraft

disasters, Special Agent personnel have interviewed friends and/or

relatives for detailed background information, obtained dental charts

and medical records, and forwarded same to the disaster scene for

the use of dentists and pathologists in identifying those victims not

identifiable by fingerprints. This procedure requires a substantial

amount of Agent time and if followed in the future could place an un-

usually heavy burden on the Bureau with the introduction in early 1970

of aircraft carrying 300 to 400 passengers. Consequently, participation

by the FBI in future disasters will be limited to identifying as many of

the victims by fingerprints as possible and Agent personnel will not be

used in obtaining complete background information concerning each

victim unless such information is needed in a case where the Bureau

has investigative jurisdiction.

This limitation should be clearly

explained to

representatives of the carrier, local police or other

requesting agency at the time request for Disaster Squad assistance

(G) EMERGENCY DETENTION PROGEAM -- The Department has ap-

proved a suggestion that Security Index (SI) subjects currently designated

as Priority III be maintained separately. For administrative purposes

Priority III subjects will continue to be maintained as a portion of the SI

but all decisions relating to such individuals will be made strictly within

the Bureau. Priority I and Priority II subjects will continue to be re-

viewed and approved by the Department. This decision was based on the

Department's intention to consider only those individuals in Priority I

and Priority Il for apprehension in the event the Emergency Detention

Program is placed in effect.

All SI cards pertaining to Priority III subjects should be

immediately separated from those cards pertaining to Priority I and

Priority II subjects and maintained in a separate section of the SI. These

subjects will continue to be designated as Priority III and the criteria for

including subjects in this category will remain the same. The Depart-

ment will be completely divorced from any action pertaining to Priority

Ill subjects.

This administrative handling of Priority Ill subjects should not

generate any reevaluation of your SI subjects since any redesignations of

Priorities at this time will be carefully scrutinized at the Bureau.

Residence and employment of Priority II subjects should be

verified on an annual basis as is the current practice. In connection with

this verification, the case file should be thoroughly reviewed for any

necessary action to be taken including a reevaluation of the subject's

status. This includes removal from Priority III or possible redesignation

as a Priority I or Priority I SI subject.

As investigations are completed regarding additional security

subjects, the investigative results should be submitted to the Bureau by

summary-type report along with your recommendations regarding in-

clusion on Priorities I, Il or Ill. Once an individual is approved for

inclusion in Priority II any pertinent subsequent information may be

furnished by letterhead memorandum. No investigative reports will

be required in Priority Ill cases subsequent to the initial summary-type

report. Reports will continue to be required in Priority I and. Priority II

SI cases in accordance with Section 87D of the Manual of Instructions.

With the establishment of this procedure, the maintenance of

the Reserve Index A (RI-A) will be discontinued at the Bureau. The

RI-A will be maintained solely by each field division in the same manner

as Reserve Index B is currently handled.

Manual changes will be forthcoming. All surveys and programs

in connection with Emergency Detention Program should be adjusted

accordingly. Revision of necessary forms will be forthcoming.

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

January 9, 1968

• (A) LINEUPS -- SAC Letters 67-39 and 67-61 contained instructions for

compliance with the June 12, 1967, Supreme Court decisions in U.S. v.

Wade, 388 U.S. 218, Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263 and Stovallv.

Denno, 388 U.S. 293.

The Department of Justice has furnished additional instructions

in this regard and these are summarized here for your guidance.

The Department takes the position that 'If an agent is present

and is able to testify for the government as to the circumstances of the

line-up, it is not necessary to have an assistant United States Attorney

present at every line-up. "

Recently a lineup was held in a Bureau case and no

representative of the United States Attorney's office was present.

Activities of defense counsel seriously interfered with the conduct of

the lineup. Since the lineup proceeding is now a "critical stage" of the

criminal process, it is most desirable to have a representative of the

United States Attorney's office present to deal with questions and objections

raised by defense counsel.

You are instructed to continue to immediately notify the

United States Attorney of the time and place as soon as a lineup has been

scheduled and to request attendance at the lineup by a representative of

his office. Advise the Bureau of any difficulties in this regard so that they

may be brought to the attention of the Department.

The Department advised that the defense counsel cannot

require a lineup for the accused. Any request for a lineup by defense

counsel should be referred to the United States Attorney.

The Department states, "With respect to establishing

probable cause to arrest a person at liberty, who would not be available

for a line-up, a viewing without a line-up may be necessary. In that

situation, it would be desirable, if at all possible, that the viewing be

under circumstances where the witness will not have the person

specifically pointed out to him. It is impossible to cover all factual

variations.

The aim should be to have the show-up as fair and as free

from suggestion to the witness as possible."

Good judgment must be exercised to insure that any viewing

of a suspect by a witness be as free from suggestive influence as possible,

as the witness may later be called to make an in-court identification.

At the line-up, you will be obliged to stand in a line with

an attorney but wish to have one present at the line-up, the

As you were advised

in'SAC Letter 67-61, the lineup is a nontestimonial identification process

not covered by the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination

and no warning of any rights under the Fifth Amendment is required. Before

any lineup is held in the absence of counsel for the accused a waiver must be

obtained.

The Department stated a waiver of rights to have counsel

present at the lineup should also be obtained prior to the lineup from a suspect,

not under arrest, who consents to appear in a lineup. You may adapt the

wording of the above warning and waiver to this situation by changing the

third sentence of the warning to read, "You are not required to participate.

(B) FIREARMS - CONFISCATION, DONATION, RETURN TO OWNER --

The following notice appeared in the United States Attorneys Bulletin

for December 22, 1967 :

"Title 18 U.S. C. 3611 provides in substance that

a judgment of conviction may include an order by the court

confiscating any firearms or ammunition found at the time of

arrest in the possession or under the immediate control of a

defendant subsequently found guilty of one of the offenses

enumerated in the statute. Crimes which come within the

scope of the statute include murder, manslaughter, rape,

robbery, killing or assaulting a Federal officer, bank robbery

and kidnapping.

"Frequently revolvers, rifles and other weapons

taken from criminals are not subject to forfeiture under other

Federal laws, and it is obviously undesirable to have the weapons

returned to individuals who may use them in committing crimes

of violence. Accordingly, it is strongly recommended that 18

U.S. C. 3611 be brought to the court's attention in proper cases

at the time of sentence for the purpose of preventing the return

of the weapons to convicted felons."

The referenced statute covers the offense of transporting

a stolen motor vehicle in interstate or foreign commerce, or committing

or attempting to commit a felony in violation of any law of the United States

which felony involves ". . • the use of threats, force, or violence" or

is"... perpetrated in whole or in part by the use of firearms." The

statute also states that "The court may direct the delivery of such firearms

or ammunition to the law-enforcement agency which apprehended such

person, for its use or for any other disposition in its discretion."

The Bureau has no objection to a court order directing

disposal by the FBI Laboratory.

Other Federal statutes, indexed under "Firearms"' in the

United States Code Annotated, occasionally may be useful in obtaining the

court order. There is a variety of them, such as those providing for

forfeiture of firearms used in violation of liquor laws, forfeiture of firearms

used to kill or capture birds or animals unlawfully in named national parks,

and declaring contraband any firearm with respect to which there has been

committed any violation of any provision of the National Firearms Act or

any regulation issued pursuant thereto. The responsibility for selecting

the applicable statute, if any, is that of the United States Attorney.

If the case does not fit within Title 18 U.S.C. 3611 or

any other statute allowing confiscation or forfeiture on court order, there

are other disposal possibilities, as follows:

(1) If the subject owns the gun, obtain from him a signed

waiver of ownership rights and send the gun to the FBI Laboratory.

(2) If the subject owns the gun, is convicted and will not

waive ownership rights, deliver the gun to the U.S. Marshal as part of

the prisoner's property.

See U.S. Marshals Manual, Section 709.01.

Or, deliver to the subject's attorney or other designated representative.

In either case obtain and file a receipt.

(3) If the subject owns the gun, is acquitted, and will not

waive ownership rights, deliver the gun to him or to his designated

representative. Obtain and file a receipt.

(4) If the gun was stolen from a known and legitimate owner,

return the gun to him. If the gun is the property of the United States, return

it to the nearest office of the service concerned. Obtain and file a receipt.

(5) If the gun was stolen and the legitimate owner is unknown,

deliver the gun to the United States Marshal as abandoned or unclaimed

property. See U.S. Marshals Manual, Section 322. 01. Obtain and file a

receipt.

(6) Whatever the ownership status of the gun, if this Bureau

only borrowed it as evidence from another law enforcement agency which

obtained the gun upon arrest of the subject, return it to that agency. Obtain

and file a receipt.

(7) If the prisoner is not prosecuted federally and is delivered

to some other agency, as in the case of a deserter or a person arrested for

Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution, deliver the gun to that agency along with

the prisoner. Obtain and file a receipt.

(8) In any case of legitimate doubt on whether the gun should

be held for evidence, or returned to the subject at this time, or at any time,

or be delivered to some other claimant, hold the gun and force the claiming

party to take his civil remedy at law for its return. The United States

Attorney must approve this action in advance; he may be required to defend

it.

Under no circumstances are you to send a weapon to the

FBI Laboratory for disposition "on the authority of the United States

Attorney." This latter official has no power by statute or otherwise to

make such a disposition.

Occasionally, a citizen may offer a firearm as a gift to the

FBI for inclusion in the Reference Firearms Collection. If the firearm

is accepted it must be accompanied by a release from the owner which shows

that the weapon is being given to the FBI unconditionally with the understanding

that if the FBI Laboratory has a similar weapon or for any other reason does

not desire to retain this one, the weapon hereby given to the FBI may be

destroyed.

Advise all investigative personnel. At this time of

special concern over the use of firearms to commit crimes, you should

neglect no opportunity to obtain confiscation, forfeiture or surrender of

ownership in any appropriate case.

(C) FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY ASSOCIATES RETRAINING SESSIONS

FOR 1968 -- Advise the Bureau, Attention: Training Division, by June

1, 1968, the dates and places of your 1968 retraining sessions for graduates

of the FBI National Academy. I your retraining session will be held in

advance of that date, Bureau should be given at least 30 days' notice. The

Bureau should be furnished with the detailed program to be followed, and

your personal attention should be given to the planning of these sessions

to make certain that the emphasis is on subject matter of value and

interest to the graduates who will attend.

All correspondence should be directed to the Bureau, Attention:

Training Division, and should be submitted on an unless-advised-to-the-

contrary-by-Bureau (UACB) basis.

You are reminded that in July, 1968, there will be a Sectional

Retraining Session in Section II (Central States) from July 14-17 at the

Fontainebleau Motor Hotel in New Orleans, Louisiana. No regularly

scheduled chapter retraining sessions should be held in Section Il during

1968. Graduates from the Central States as well as from the rest of the

chapters should be invited to participate, as always, in your field fire-

arms training programs, police schools, and other Bureau functions.

To assist the host chapter in New Orleans, each Special Agent

in Charge of field offices located in states making up Section II should

make certain that all eligible graduates in their territories are aware

of the retraining session in New Orleans and have notified the secretary

of their own chapter whether they expect to attend. All SACs should be

aware that any graduate in good standing is welcome to attend Sectional

Retraining Sessions in any section. Any graduate expecting to attend

the retraining session in New Orleans should be advised to make proper

reservations through the host chapter without delay. The personal

attention of each SAC is imperative to stimulate interest in not only the

Sectional Retraining Session in New Orleans but also each of the other

chapter retraining sessions.

(A) PUBLIC LAW 90-206 - POSTAL REVENUE AND FEDERAL SALARY

ACT OF 1967 - EMPLOYMENT OF RELATIVES - RESTRICTIONS -

PERSONNEL MATTER - One section of captioned Law specifies

restrictions with respect to employment of relatives by employees

defined as "public official." Under the Law a public official is an

employee in whom is vested or to whom is delegated the authority to

appoint, employ, promote, or advance individuals, or to recommend

individuals for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement.

"Relative" means an individual who is related to the public official as

father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, first

cousin, nephew, niece, husband, wife, father-in-law, mother-in-law.

son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, stepfather,

stepmother, stepson, stepdaughter, stepbrother, stepsister, half

brother, or half sister.

The restrictions are as follows: (1) A public official shall

not advocate one of his relatives for appointment, employment, promotion,

or advancement to a position in his agency (entire Department of Justice

in our case) or in an agency over which he exercises jurisdiction or control.

(2) A public official shall not appoint, employ, promote, or advance to a

position in his agency or in an agency over which he exercises jurisdiction

or control: (a) one of his relatives; or (b) the relative of a public official

of his agency or of a public official who exercises jurisdiction or control

over his agency, if the public official has advocated the appointment,

employment, promotion, or advancement of his relative. Further, a

public official who recommends a relative, or refers a relative for

consideration by a public official standing lower in his "chain of command"

(the line of supervisory personnel that runs from a public official to the

head of his agency), for appointment, employment, promotion, or

advancement is deemed to have advocated such action concerning

the relative. It is particularly important that the Law be carefully

adhered to because it specifies that an individual appointed, employed,

promoted, or advanced in violation of the Law is not entitled to pay.

The spirit of the Law is essentially that practiced by the

Bureau anyway. It is observed that the fact authority to recommend for

promotion or advancement is rather broad in the Bureau increases

considerably the number of potential public officials we have as defined

by the Law. Whereas the Law does not prohibit relatives of public

officials from being appointed, employed, promoted, or advanced in

the same agency as the public official, the record concerning any such

personnel action will have to show that the public official did not advocate

or effect the action involved concerning his relative. Insure the Law is

adhered to in your office. If any questions arise they should be referred

to the Bureau.

The Law applies to the Executive, Legislative, and

Judicial Branches of Government. The Law does not provide criminal

provisions, the Bureau does not have investigative jurisdiction, and any

complaint received of violation by someone outside the Bureau should be

referred to the appropriate Government entity involved. A manual

revision is being prepared.

(B) SECURITY OF FM RADIO TRANSMISSIONS -- You have been

reminded repeatedly of the possibility that FBI radio transmissions may

be heard by unauthorized individuals and that FM radio transmissions

must be discreet at all times. In a previous SAC letter, you were advised

of the monitoring of FBI radio transmissions by the subject of a sensitive

surveillance and the introduction in court of notes made by the subject

while monitoring. Many criminals have been apprehended with radio

receivers in their possession which were or could be tuned to the Bureau's

frequencies. More and more relatively low-priced receivers, many

selling for under $25, which are capable of monitoring FBI transmissions,

are being offered for sale by radio dealers. This, of course, greatly

increases the possibility of the Bureau's radio transmissions being over-

heard by unauthorized persons.

It is desired that this be brought to the attention of all

personnel. In addition, you should personally examine the manner in which

your FM radio facilities are being utilized to insure that the operation of

such facilities is in strict accordance with existing Bureau instructions

as set out in Paragraph 9, Chapter 4, Part II, FBI Handbook.

2314). This case involved an alleged scheme concocted in Buffalo,

New York, during February, 1965, to commit two robberies in Los

Angeles, California, and to transport the proceeds of these robberies

from Los Angeles to Buffalo. Some interstate travel reportedly was

performed in connection with this conspiracy, but neither of the

robberies took place.

The Department has now advised it intends to consider

asserting Federal jurisdiction under the robbery-conspiracy provisions

of the Hobbs Act (which prohibits interference or conspiracy to interfere

with interstate commerce by robbery or extortion by means of actual or

threatened force, violence, or fear) when the persons involved are

known organized crime subjects suspected of engaging in such activities.

Accordingly, the Department desires to be furnished information received

concerning the involvement of known organized crime subjects, suspected

subjects, or known or suspected associates of organized crime subjects,

with any robbery, robbery attempt, or robbery conspiracy which may in

any way affect interstate commerce.

In this regard it is not desired that every robbery be fully

investigated for the purpose of ascertaining definite organized crime

involvement; only information received in the normal course of FBI

operation and gathering of intelligence data which meets the above

criteria should be furnished.

Information in this regard should be forwarded to the Bureau

in letterhead memorandum (LHM) form suitable for dissemination to the

Department by cover airtel. In addition to the information concerning

such a matter, LHM should contain detailed documentation regarding the

organized crime affiliations of persons involved in such matters. LHM

should conclude with a statement that the Criminal Division of the

Department is requested to advise the Bureau whether further investigation

by the FBI under the Hobbs Act is warranted or whether the information

concerning the matter should be referred to local authorities. You will

be informed of the determination made by the Department.

As regards ITSP, the Department has advised that

conspiracies to violate this statute are violative of the Federal law,

even where the theft of property has not actually occurred, and Federal

investigation and prosecution may be appropriate in certain instances.

Accordingly, when information is received indicating a conspiracy to

commit a theft or robbery of $5, 000 or more and transport the proceeds

in interstate commerce, the Department requests that such information

be furnished to the appropriate U. S. Attorney for determination as to

Whether full-scale investigation should be conducted or whether the

matter should be referred to local authorities.

It is to be noted that

this procedure applies to all ITSP conspiracies; it is not limited to

those involving persons with organized crime affiliations.

Therefore, in each instance where information comes to

your attention indicating such a conspiracy, even though a theft has not

occurred, the facts are to be discussed immediately with the U. S.

Attorney and appropriate action should be taken in accordance with his

decision and existing procedures. In each such case following discussion

with the U. S. Attorney advise the Bureau of the full facts. This is to be

brought to the attention of all Special Agents and borne in mind as a possible

means of prosecution of active burglars, hold-up men and fences.

Appropriate manual changes will be forwarded.

(D) RABBLE ROUSER INDEX -- By SAC Letter 67-70 dated

November 28, 1967, you were advised that the Rabble Fouser Index

is being expanded to include agitators who have attracted local

attention as well as those who have attracted national attention. In

view of the expansion of this Index, it is being programmed into the

Bureau's automatic data processing equipment.

To facilitate the submission of the necessary background

information, organizational affiliations, and other data on the

individuals recommended for inclusion in the Index, Form FD-397 has

been devised. A supply of these forms will be forwarded to you in the

near future.

An original and one copy of Form FD-397 shall be completed

and forwarded to the Bureau by the office of origin on each individual it

recommends. A succinct resume of the subject's activities on which the

recommendation is based shall be attached. Current instructions

require submission of an up-to-date investigative report with

recommendations for inclusion. In view of the urgency of the over-all

racial situation which dictates cataloging of all potential racial agitators

as soon as possible, you should submit Form FD-397 as soon as

sufficient background for that purpose has been developed through

investigation. In such instances, an investigative report should be

submitted as soon as possible thereafter.

Upon receipt of Form FD-397 at the Bureau, the case of the

subject will be reviewed and if the recommendation is concurred in,

Rabble Rouser Index cards will be prepared. The duplicate copy of the

form will be returned to the office of origin stamped "Rabble Rouser Index

card approved and prepared, copy attached. " The returned copy of

Form FD-397 shall be placed in the subject's main investigative case

file in your office and the Index card filed alphabetically in a card index

file designated "Rabble Rouser Index. "

With regard to the individuals presently on the Rabble

Rouser Index, you should resubmit the background and other required

information on a Form FD-397 clearly indicating that it is a resubmission.

Upon receipt of Form FD-397, a Rabble Rouser Index card will be

prepared on each of these individuals at the Bureau. The duplicate copy

of the form will be returned to the office of origin with a copy of the

1-16-68

SAC LETTER 68-5

- 5 -

NW 55069 DoeId: 32989528

Page 845

## Page 846

Index card attached for appropriate filing by the office of origin as

outlined above. Since the Index cards will be maintained by you in a

card index file, it will no longer be necessary for you to maintain the

Index in the loose-leaf binder as you are presently doing.

Form FD-397 should also be used for the submission of

any amendments and/or necessary updating, as well as to recommend

the deletion of an individual from the Rabble Rouser Index.

When

recommending the addition of a new subject to the Index or the deletion

of a subject from the Index, Form FD-397 should be accompanied by an

abstract. No abstract is necessary when submitting amendments or

changes only.

Set forth below is an explanation of the code letters

pertaining to organizational affiliations which will appear on Form FD-397.

• January 31, 1968

(A) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- You have been

previously advised that priority attention must be given to the develop-

ment of penetrative coverage of militant black nationalist groups and ghetto

areas. Token coverage of these groups and areas is not acceptable.

Emphasis has been and will continue to be placed on the racial informant

program until each field division is operating a diversified active cadre

of individuals which includes members of black nationalist organizations

and militant youth groups, close associates of militant racists, ghetto-

types, and individuals from other walks of life depending upon the situation

in a particular area. Imagination, ingenuity, and aggressiveness are

necessary in order to successfully combat violence-prone persons and

groups and to fulfill our internal security responsibilities.

It such has not been previously handled, each field division

is to immediately contact local military authorities for the purpose of

securing the identities (names, addresses, and other available background

data) of recently released servicemen and arrange to obtain similar

information on a regular basis in the future. These individuals represent

a reservoir of potential racial informants and sources who should on a

selective basis be considered for development under captioned program.

As pointed out in the monograph entitled "Development of Racial Informants. "

copies of which are available in each field division, the young men recently

discharged from military service have been trained to respond to orders

and direction and are usually interested in making extra money. Many of

these discharged servicemen undoubtedly reside or work in ghetto areas

and, if experienced in demolition or riot control matters, could be of

definite interest to and targets for recruitment by militant black nationalists.

The above-mentioned monograph contains valuable data relating to this

program and it is expected that Special Agent personnel working in the

racial field are familiar with its contents.

You are again reminded that employees in your divisions may

have friends, relatives, or acquaintances who could be of assistance to

the Bureau in our racial intelligence gathering endeavors. Explore this

possibility with your employees bearing in mind that many of them may

NW 55069

DocId: 32989528

Page 847

---

## Page 848

recall persons in their home town areas who would be cooperative and

who may have access to or may be able to obtain valuable information.

In order to secure necessary coverage in the racial field,

some offices have initiated logical programs which it is felt should be

given appropriate consideration by all divisions. These programs include

interviews with individuals arrested by local authorities during prior

periods of racial disturbances, employees and owners of various business

establishments in ghetto areas such as taverns, liquor stores, drugstores,

pawnshops, gun shops, and barbershops, and with janitors of apartment

buildings.

Successful contacts have also been made with those individuals

who frequent ghetto areas on a regular basis, such as taxicab drivers,

salesmen, and distributors of newspapers, food, and beverages. This

is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of potential areas of concentration

as there are obviously others deserving of your immediate attention.

You were informed by SAC Letter 67-62 dated October 17,

1967, that priority attention to racial informant matters was a necessity

during the next six months. You no longer have six months to accomplish

that which must be done. Continuing emphasis must be given to this

matter in order for the Bureau to fulfill its vast obligations in the racial

field. Your efforts and results will continue to be followed closely at

the Bureau and during field Inspections.

(A) SECURITY OF FIELD OFFICES -- I have become increasingly

concerned with the security of field offices during the nighttime hours,

especially those offices which are manned by Security Patrol Clerks.

A recent nationwide telecast indicated that a particular field office was

stated at night by a lone clerk. It is conceivable that criminals,

members of racist extremist groups, revolutionaries in exile, or

psychotic individuals might attempt to enter a field office at night if

they should become aware that only one or two clerks are on duty in the

office. You should impress upon employees assigned to nighttime duty

the necessity for maintaining maximum security in your office. You

should particularly caution Security Patrol Clerks to be most circumspect

in their telephone conversations with outsiders and to never acknowledge

they are alone in the office and that no Agent is present. I expect you

to check at irregular intervals on security safeguards in your office to

insure that our space remains inviolate.

(C) TEN MOST WANTED FUGITIVES PROGRAM -- During the month

of January, 1968, six Ten Most Wanted Fugitives were located which

represents a record number during any given month in connection with

this program. Review of the investigations which led to the six locations

again points up the results which can be achieved when there is aggres-

sive participation on the part of auxiliary offices. Present requirements:

(FBI Handbook, Part I, page 25) provide that all continental offices

must keep these cases pending and fully exploit investigative techniques

which are readily available, including various record checks.

In one instance wherein two dangerous Top Ten Fugitives

were ultimately located together through vigorous investigative effort,

the initial break which prompted the successful investigation stemmed

from persistent efforts to locate registration of a motor vehicle reported

to have been at one time in the possession of one of the fugitives.

In another Ten Most Wanted Fugitive case an office, without

any specific leads, effectively utilized the background data developed

through investigation by another field division which pinpointed the cur-

rent employment of the fugitive. The office involved in this investigation

conducted numerous agency checks on the basis of the aliases employed

by the subject, including that of a relative with an entirely different

name, whose identity he had assumed.

Identification of another fugitive as having been deceased

was triggered by information from a citizen who had observed the sub-

ject's photograph on a display in a Resident Agency of an auxiliary office,

while another Top Ten Fugitive was located in January, 1968, after his

photograph was recognized in a magazine.

In addition, one of the six fugitives was identified because

of a previous alert placed with foreign police authorities along the

Canadian border. In appropriate cases, border offices should be aware

of the necessity for close liaison with established police sources near

the border.

Each office must fully share responsibility for the con-

tinued success of the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives Program. As indicated,

this requires that aggressive, independent, self-initiated investigation

be undertaken in headquarters cities and Resident Agencies on the basis

of current developments. All offices must also be alert to recommend

the best possible candidates suitable for inclusion in this program.

SAC.LETTER 68-14

(D) CRIMINAL INFORMANT PROGRAM -- In order to establish

uniformity throughout the field in the handling of criminal, security and

racial informant files, you should be certain that all pending and closed

symbol number informant files are maintained under lock and key under

the personal supervision of the SAC, ASAC, Field Supervisor or

responsible employee designated by the SAC.

Section 108 Hlc, Manual of Instructions, requires the

submission of all statistical accomplishments which can be credited to

criminal informants or potential criminal informants be reported on

the first monthly progress letter submitted after the accomplishment

took place. Recently it has been noted that a large number of

statistical accomplishments that should be credited to criminal in-

formants have not been reported on the monthly progress letter as

required. You must follow this matter closely and be certain that all

accomplishments are being credited to informants and properly and

promptly reported each month on the monthly progress letter.

You are again being reminded that any outstanding ac-

complishments that can be credited to your informants during the

preceding month should be set forth in a succinct resume on a separate

sheet of paper attached to the back of your monthly progress letter.

Many offices are failing to comply with this regulation. Also, for the

sake of uniformity Bureau regulations require that symbol number

informants added or deleted after the twenty-fifth of the month be

recorded on the following monthly progress letter. Your specific

attention regarding these two requirements is directed to Section 108 H,

Manual of Instructions.

(E) SECURITY INFORMANTS - CONTROL -- The Department has •

recently submitted to the Bureau a number of requests concerning the

availability of certain security informants for interview by Depart-

mental Attorneys and possible testimony in prosecutions under the

amended Internal Security Act of 1950. It has come to my attention

that in many cases security informants have shown considerable

reluctance to be interviewed or to testify, except in the event of a

national emergency, for fear of physical harm, social and business

reprisals, and other personal reasons. Inasmuch as the interviews

with Departmental Attorneys will be conducted with full precautions

to protect the security of the informants, I fully expect that all informants

will be available for interviews.

I wish to reiterate existing instructions that it is the

responsibility of the Special Agents handling security informants to

condition them to the fact that someday the knowledge they possess may

be needed as evidence in court or at another hearing to assist our

Government in combating the evils of subversion. The Bureau has

always stressed the necessity for all Special Agents handling security

informants to psychologically prepare the informants for the fact they

may, at some future date, be called upon to render a most important

contribution to their Government by testifying to the information they

have furnished.

The proper indoctrination of informants in this regard is

absolutely essential, since it is incumbent upon the Bureau to make

informants available for interview whenever the Department initiates

prosecution in security cases. If following an interview of an informant

the Department feels that the testimony of the informant is absolutely

essential to a successful prosecution, it will be permissible for you to

make appropriate recommendations regarding the effect which the

release of the particular informant involved would have on the security

coverage in your territory. However, it must be borne in mind that

the ultimate decision as to the release of an informant will be made

by the Attorney General in the best interest of the national security.

As a general rule, all of our security informants are considered avail-

able for interview by Departmental Attorneys and for testimony if

needed. Only a very few are furnishing information of such a highly

sensitive and important nature as to preclude their use.

(A) TRAINING - POLICE - FILM ENTITLED "THE POSITIVE IMAGE" --

The Bureau has prepared a new training film entitled "The Positive

Image. " This is a 16 millimeter, color sound film which was made

for use before law enforcement groups. A permanent retention copy

is being forwarded to you.

For your information, this film is concerned with the sub-

ject of police-community relations. Its purpose is to show the working

police officer a variety of situations which involve "community relations,"

in the broadest sense, and to convince him that his professional attitudes

in his contacts with the citizen in connection with his official duties can

change the police image for the better.

The teaching body of "The Positive Image" contains a series

of dramatized incidents, each dealing with a different community

relations problem. All are confrontations of citizen and policeman

in situations of tension. Each presents a stereotyped, negative reaction

of the citizen to the police officer at the moment of confrontation and

how the officer can dispel this negative reaction by his professional

approach.

The point is made that the policeman, by acquiring and

maintaining a professional attitude with all citizens, can improve the

public's attitude toward the law enforcement profession and thus make

his work easier and him a more effective law enforcement officer.

It is felt that this film, as a visual aid, will have a stronger

impact on the viewer if preceded by appropriate remarks by the Bureau

instructor presenting the program.

(B) EXCESSIVE USE OF AIRTELS -- I have noticed that unnecessary

airtels are being received at the Bureau with increasing frequency.

Field inspections indicate a similar increase of unnecessary airtels

between various field offices. The airtel was devised for use on a

restricted basis to combine the expedite handling afforded teletypes

with the economy of airmail transmission. This system has been

very effective but obviously vigorous steps must be taken to keep airtels

at a minimum because this excessive use will clog our facilities for

expedite handling and defeat the purpose for which airtels were intended.

In many instances manual provisions specifically require

the use of airtels. Some of these requirements are being eliminated

and appropriate manual changes will be forthcoming in the near future.

However, the principal problem appears to be that airtels are being

used in numerous instances where they are not required by regulations

and where they are not justified by the urgency of the situation. I have

instructed officials at the Seat of Government and the Inspection Staff

to be alert for such instances and to recommend disciplinary action

where indicated.

Where specific regulations have not been issued, good

judgment must be used to determine the urgency and the transmittal

method. When deciding whether to use an airtel or a letter, keep in

mind that processing of routine mall is necessarily slower at the seat

of Government and in the larger offices because of the very heavy

volume of mail. Processing of strictly routine mail at the Seat of

Government may take as long as two or three days. I will expect the

cooperation of all employees to keep the airtel a valuable communi-

cation device.

(C) YOUNG AMERICAN MEDALS FOR BRAVERY AND SERVICE

NOMINATIONS FOR 1967 -- The Attorney General has advised the

Governors of all the states and territories, and the Commissioner of

the, pistrict of Columbia, that nominations of candidates for the 1967

awafas will be received until May 31, 1968. They have been requested

to send the nominations to the Young American Medals Committee,

Room 5116, Department of Justice, Washington, D. C. 20530, and have

been forwarded copies of the rules and regulations governing the awards.

The Attorney General has again emphasized the necessity

that nominations be accompanied by complete documentation concerning

the actions of the nominees for consideration.

In 1967, the Governors had until August 30th to submit their

nominations. You should bring this program to the attention of appropriate

local and police officials to remind them of the early deadline in effect

this year and to encourage them to remain alert to likely candidates for

these awards. It has been noted in the past that the submission of

candidates for the Service Award has not been in proportion to the many

young people who are performing acts which would qualify them as

candidates for this award. It should be pointed out that all nominations

should be made through the Governor of the individual state.

Any candidate of whom you become aware should be brought

to the attention of appropriate authorities for consideration and possible

submission for this award.

women, which should sustain and increase opportunities for women

in the Bureau's service. In connection with means of attracting women

to the Bureau's service, you are referred to the Manual of Rules and

Regulations, Part I, Section 10F, 4 under equal employment opportunity.

(E) FEDERAL RESERVE ACT MATTERS -- Public Law 90-203,

approved 12/15/67 and effective 4/1/68, prohibits National banks,

state member banks of the Federal Reserve System, other state banks

insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and savings and

loan associations insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance

Corporation from fostering or participating in gambling activities,

lotteries in particular.

This law amends Chapter 61, Title 18, U. S.

Code, "lotteries, " by adding thereto new Section 1306.

The law revises various Federal banking regulatory statutes

and prohibits banks and savings and loan associations from dealing in

lottery tickets; dealing in bets used as a means or substitute for

participation in lottery; prohibits announcements, advertisements, or

publicity relative to the existence of any lottery; prohibits announcements,

advertisements or publicity relative to the existence or identity of

any participant or winner, as such, in a lottery; prohibits the use of

any part of the institutions' offices by any person for any purpose

prohibited above; and prohibits direct access by the public from any

of the institutions' offices to any premises used by any person for any

purpose prohibited above. New Section 1306, Title 18, U. S. Code,

provides a maximum penalty of $1, 000 fine or imprisonment of not more

than one year, or both, for above-mentioned criminal violations.

Nothing contained in this law prohibits a named institution

from accepting deposits or handling checks or other negotiable

instruments or performing other lawful banking services for a state

operating a lottery, or for an employee of that state charged with the

administration of the lottery.

The Department has advised that the Bureau has investi-

gative jurisdiction over alleged violations of criminal provisions of

this new law. Since the administrative enforcement rests with various

Federal banking regulatory agencies, such investigations will be

handled as Federal Reserve Act matters.

Appropriate manual changes are being prepared.

(F) COMMUNIST INFILTRATIÓN OF THE CONGRESS OF RACIAL

EQUALITY -- The Congress of Racial Equality under the leadership

of Floyd McKissick has steadily moved away from a legitimate civil

rights organization in recent months and is assuming a militant black

nationalist posture with some leaders in their public statements

condoning acts of violence as a means of attaining Negro rights. It is

moving toward the exclusion of members of the white race from its

ranks. Communist infiltration at this point is negligible. In view of

the above, this organization should be investigated in the future under

the Racial Matters character rather than under the Communist

Infiltration character.

You should, of course, in your continuing investigation

of the Congress of Racial Equality be alert to the participation of

Communist Party members in the organization or communist influence

therein. However, your investigation should be directed toward

developing in detail intelligence information regarding the basic aims

and objectives of the organization, its activities and programs on a

current basis, and any information indicating that members thereof

advocate violence as a means of attaining their objectives or

participate in actual violence.

(G) SECURITY FLASH NOTICES -- As you are aware, many activists

of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee travel extensively

throughout the United States in connection with their Student Nonviolent

Coordinating Committee activities. Many have been arrested in the

past on various local and/or Federal charges and in view of their

propensity for violence many will undoubtedly be arrested in the future.

In an effort to provide additional information regarding

their possible travels, a Security Flash should be posted with the

Identification Division in every instance in which an identification

record exists on a Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee activist.

As individuals are identified as affiliates in the future, Security

Flashes should be posted by the office of origin in order that it may be

notified should the individual be arrested or otherwise fingerprinted.

(H) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- Recently there

were held at the Seat of Government specialized conferences concerning

militant black nationalist investigations and racial informant matters.

These conferences were attended by representatives from key field

offices handling the major portion of the Bureau's work in this field.

The conferees were unanimous in their observation that

money is the primary motivating force in developing racial informants.

In view of this, they recommended that each Special Agent in Charge be

given authority to expend up to $400 in the development of racial

informants instead of the $200 the majority of Special Agents in Charge

may now expend on their own authority.

I concur with this recommendation of the conferees and

effective March 15, 1968, the Special Agents in Charge of all field

divisions are authorized to expend the sum of $400 in the development

of racial informants. In this connection, you are reminded that money

expended for informant development must be on a c.o.d. basis and full

value must be received in proportion to the amount of money expended.

Appropriate Manual change will be forthcoming.

In addition, the above-mentioned conferences strongly

recommend that those field divisions in the Black Nationalist Informant

Program (BLACPRO) should continue to have one or more Agents

assigned exclusively to the development of racial informants under the

above Program. I also concur with this recommendation. Therefore,

each Special Agent in Charge participating in BLACPRO must assign

one or more Agents to work exclusively on informant development for

the purpose of expeditiously infiltrating militant black nationalist

organizations as well as being in a position to follow the activities of

militant black nationalist individuals who may travel or instigate racial

violence in their respective divisions.

As you have been previously advised, I expect each field

division to give the matter of racial informant development priority

attention in order that the Bureau will be able to fulfill its responsibilities

in the racial field.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

Director

(A) AGENTS ACTING IN UNDERCOVER CAPACITY -- The field should

be selective in applying this technique. Careful consideration and planning

are prerequisites to the successful utilization of an undercover operation.

Under no circumstances should an Agent pose as an attorney or assume

other identity so as to create a relationship which is legally privileged.

(B) HUMAN INTEREST ITEM PROGRAM - EXPANSION OF - Reference

SAC Letter 65-17. You are instructed to immediately expand your

contributions to the "Human Interest Item" program to include information

relating to cooperation and assistance to the FBI and other enforcement

agencies by members of various professions and occupations. In many of

your submissions this can be achieved simply by inserting the occupations

of the individuals mentioned in the items. In addition, you should be alert

for items which show that because of a person's occupation he was in

position to be of assistance to law enforcement in that particular instance.

Items relating to doctors, druggists, dentists, teachers, auto dealers,

bankers, service station attendants, bus drivers, businessmen, and

¡others are examples of the types needed. Your strict compliance with

these instructions is necessary so that the Bureau may adequately meet

its obligations under this program.

(C) SELECTIVE SERVICE MATTERS -- The number of individuals

charged with Selective Service violations who are awaiting trial is on

the increase. After our investigation is completed the delay in the

machinery of prosecution works to the advantage of the subject. It

is quite apparent that many subjects are attempting various types of

delaying tactics and fewer are pleading guilty and instead are asking

for trials.

There is evidence that in many cases when the individual

has exhausted all legal and illegal measures to prevent his being

inducted, he then "volunteers" for induction. He thus has delayed his

induction many months, sometimes well over a year. Some will use

this technique right up to the time of trial, will then submit to induction

and thereafter process is dismissed and they avoid acquiring a

criminal record.

It is imperative that each investigation conducted in these

matters be penetrative and complete as possible and the results

forwarded to the United States Attorney without delay.

Your attention is directed to Manual of Instructions, Volume

III, Section 90 B-C, in which you are reminded of that portion of the

Selective Service law which states that such cases shall be advanced

on the docket for immediate hearing and an appeal from the decision

or decree of any United States district court or United States circuit

court of appeals shall take precedence over all other cases pending

before the court to which the case has been reterred.

You are instructed to notify the Bureau of any undue delays

resulting from the handling of these cases by the United States

Attorney's Office in order that the Bureau may bring this to the

attention of the Department.

Also, it is the responsibility of each field office to insure

delays in prosecution of these cases are closely followed insofar as

your responsibility for statistical accomplishments is concerned.

(D) RACIAL MATTERS - GENERAL - Instructions under "General

Racial Matters" in Section 122 of the Manual of Instructions and

Chapter 62 of the FBI Handbook presently require that letterhead

memoranda submitted to the Bureau concerning possible or actual

racial violence include a statement as to the time and date that local

agencies were advised of the information and the identities of the

individuals so advised. Henceforth, information as to the time and

date local agencies were advised and the identities of the individuals

so notified should be recorded in the field office case file and need

not be included in the letterhead memorandum. The letterhead

memorandum, however, must identify the pertinent local law

enforcement agencies and interested state and Federal authorities

which were advised.

Instructions in the above-mentioned sections of the

Manual of Instructions and FBI Handbook also presently require

that where initial notice to the Bureau of a racial demonstration,

disturbance, or situation has been by teletype or airtel rather than

by a letterhead memorandum, a letterhead memorandum suitable

for dissemination be prepared and submitted the same day the

information is received except that where received after normal

working hours, it may be prepared and submitted the next workday.

Henceforth, the letterhead memorandum must be prepared and

submitted before the close of the second workday following the date

the information was received.

It is incumbent upon each Special Agent in Charge to make

certain that the above new instructions are closely adhered to in all

instances.

(E) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS - Based upon a

recommendation made by the recently concluded racial matters

conferences, all field divisions should institute procedures to

furnish the Bureau and adjoining field divisions information concerning

techniques utilized successfully to develop and handle racial informants

in militant black nationalist organizations and ghetto areas.

It has been noted that individual Special Agents devise

successful techniques for the development and handling of racial

informants. However, often these techniques are not brought

to the attention of other Agents working in this field. In view of

this, there should be a ready exchange of informant techniques between

field divisions. In this connection, your attention is directed to the

monograph captioned "Development of Racial Informants" dated

September, 1967. This monograph deais particularly with the

development of racial informants in Klan and white hate-type

organizations. However, upon receipt of the techniques concerning

the development of racial informants in the militant black nationalist

field, a revision will be made of the monograph so that these techniques

can be incorporated therein.

Recently an observation was made that Negro Special

Agents who are assigned militant black nationalist investigative

matters as well as racial informant matters were able to achieve

entree into areas wherein white Special Agents were denied. This

has been of great assistance in our investigations. All Special Agents

in Charge should consider the above observation in connection with

our utilization of the Special Agent personnel in their particular

division.

(F) STOCKPILING OF ARMS AND AMMUNITION -- The numerous

reports and allegations being received regarding the acquisition of

arms and ammunition by purchase, theft, and otherwise and the

possible stockpiling of same by black or white racial extremists

are of great concern in view of the potential for racial violence

presently existing in the Nation. These reports and allegations

are matters which should be closely followed, not only on an

individual case basis but on an over-all basis as well, in order that

information received can be studied and analyzed with regard to its

effect on the potential for racial violence.

Each office, therefore, will open and maintain a control

file under the caption "Stockpiling of Arms and Ammunition" to

which all pertinent intormation concerning the acquisition of weapons

will be channelized. The information contained in the control file is

to be reviewed at least twice monthly and pertinent information

affecting the potential for violence should be abstracted and

summarized in the semimonthly summary submitted by each office

under the caption "Possible Racial Violence, Major Urban Areas. "

The information should be set forth under the separate subheading

"Stockpiling of Arms and Ammunition." This category will replace

the present category "Thefts of Arms and Ammunition" referred to

in SAC Letter 68-10 dated February 6, 1968.

(G) RABBLE ROUSER INDEX -- Section 122 of the Manual of

Instructions under the heading "Rabble Rouser Index" requires that

an up-to-date investigative report, setting forth pertinent infor-

mation concerning the subject's rabble-rousing activities,

accompany the recommendation for including the individual on the

Rabble Rouser Index when no report has been submitted within the

past year. Henceforth, a letterhead memorandum may be submitted

rather than an investigative report. The letterhead memorandum

must contain pertinent background information, including arrest

record and a good physical description, as well as a succinct

summary of the subject's agitational activities which prompted the

recommendation for including him on the Rabble Rouser Index. The

Manual of Instructions also requires an annual report concerning each

individual whose name is included on the Rabble Rouser Index. In

the future an annual letterhead memorandum should be submitted.

The above instructions do not apply to rabble rousers who are also

on the Security Index.

It is incumbent upon each Special Agent in Charge to make

certain that the above new instructions are closely adhered to in all

instances.

(B) BAIL REFORM ACT -- Section 3146 of Title 18, United States Code,

enacted June 22, 1966, requires that any person arrested for a noncapital

federal offense be released, pending trial, on his personal recognizance

or upon the execution of an unsecured appearance bond unless the judicial

officer judge or commissioner) before whom he appears determines, in

the exercise of his discretion, that such a release will not reasonably

assure the appearance of the person as required. In making his deter-

mination". . . the judicial officer shall, on the basis of available infor-

mation, take into account the nature and circumstances of the offense

charged, the weight of the evidence against the accused, the accused's

family ties, employment, financial resources, character and mental

condition, the length of his residence in the community, his record of

convictions, and his record of appearance at court proceedings or of

flight to avoid prosecution or failure to appear at court proceedings."

The information used in the determination " . . . need not conform to

the rules pertaining to the admissibility of evidence in a court of law. "

Section 3146 and subsequent sections grant to the accused

a right of appeal. An accused alleging that he is detained without just cause,

or is to be released only on conditions which he is unable to meet, can take

his case to the courts.

To implement the statute the Department of Justice has

devised a form, Bail Reform Act Form No. 1 (AO-201), now being circulated

to United States Attorneys, United States Commissioners and Federal law

enforcement agencies. To be used officially by the judicial officer (usually

a commissioner), the form is entitled "Record Of Responses To Questions

At Bail Reform Act Hearing. " Part I is labeled "Questions For The

Representative Of The United States. " Part Il is labeled "Questions For

The Defendant Or Other Persons Having Intormation." Part I information

will be obtained by the judicial officer "

.. • principally from the represent-

ative of the United States" and Part II information "

• . • principally from the

defendant." The responses given are to be noted on the form but "Questions

need not be limited to the ones suggested here, nor need all questions be

asked in all cases. Neither the defendant nor the representative of the

United States may be compelled to answer any question. "

Several possible problems have been pointed out to the

Department of Justice, such as the fact that our investigations are not

directed toward producing bail information and that some apprehensions,

made at a place distant from the Office of Origin and on limited information,

will result in the arresting Agent initially appearing before the commissioner

without knowledge of the answers to some bail questions. The Department

has not instructed the Bureau to develop bail information, but has stated a

general plan of operation, as follows:

"We suggest that the forms should be filled out in

advance of bail hearings but in no case should they be submitted

to a judicial officer without prior approval by an Assistant

United States Attorney. It is contemplated that, in many cases,

the form completed by an arresting officer will simply constitute

a work sheet for use by the United States Attorney's office . . .

It is . . . incumbent on the United States Attorney and defense

counsel to cooperate with the courts in gathering and furnishing

the necessary information in time for the accused's first

appearance for a bail hearing. In order that the United States

Attorney be as fully advised as possible, arresting officers

should provide him promptly after an arrest or at the time of

application for an arrest warrant or summons, with as much

of the information as is possible which is called for in parts I

and Il of AO-201. Although the questions in Part Il are

directed to the defendant, accurate information concerning

them should be furnished to the United States Attorney to

help him verify or refute information which the defendant

himself may supply at the hearing. Arresting officers should

refrain, in light of Miranda v. Arizona, from interrogating

arrested defendants in order to secure information for AO-201.

They should, however, be prepared to assist in reviewing any

information which the defendant or his attorney may furnish

directly to the judicial officer.

"Because unexplained failure to submit information

to the United States Attorney might be assumed to reflect that

no reason exists for opposing release on personal bond, it is

important that all available information be recorded or that

the difficulties in securing timely information be explained.

Doold: 32989528

## Page 870

Whenever information in any category is unknown to the arresting

officer, or premature disclosure in court might compromise

effective prosecution, portions of the form may be left blank

by the officer or may be completed and presented to the United

States Attorney with appropriate cautions. The United States

Attorney has the responsibility to resolve conflicts between the

desirability of disclosing particular information for purposes

of the bail hearing or withholding the information to avoid

prejudicing the prosecution."

When it was pointed out to the Department that some arrests

necessarily will be made on an emergency basis and at a point distant from

any member of the United States Attorney's office, with the result that this

bail information could not be submitted to the United States Attorney

beforehand, the Department replied as follows:

• . . our memorandum . .

should be taken as

solely relating to the use of the form itself. We did not

intend to direct that all bail information be cleared with

the United States Attorney before the arresting officers

answer any relevant questions put to them by a judicial

officer... Our point as to the form was that without

such prior consultation we should not provide the defense,

at this early stage, with detailed information which might

not come up at the hearing itself. Thus in the situations

you outline, where prior consultation is not feasible, we

recommend that the form not be used, but that your agents

give whatever information relevant to bail as is required.

of them by the judicial officer."

The Department obviously prefers that someone in the United

States Attorney's office act as the representative of the United States in the

bail bond hearing. Cooperate fully with the United States Attorney to this end.

The Agent to whom the case is assigned should keep his bail facts available

so that he can give them to the United States Attorney (the facts then available)

when the warrant is authorized or thereafter, as desired.

You will note that some of the questions on the form, such as

those relating to evidence of guilt found on the defendant, and defendant's

admissions of guilt, call for information which we are forbidden, by directive

of the Attorney General, to release to the press. As to this problem, the

Department said:

"As the directive relates to release of information

to the news media there should be no problem in releasing

it at a relevant judicial hearing in response to a request from

the presiding official. That this may also release the information

to the press must be considered as incidental to the purposes

to be served by its release to the judicial officer. Similarly,

as the form is intended for use at a judicial hearing, the

release of such information by means of the form is not a

violation of the directive."

All questions on bail should be answered conservatively, no

matter whether the answers are given to the commissioner directly or given

indirectly through the screening process of the United States Attorney. State

facts only, not conclusions. For example, Question 12 asks, "Was evidence

of the offense found in the defendant's possession?" Answer by identifying

the things found, if any. Some of these things may prove to be evidence and

some may not; only the courts can decide. U.S. v. Pardo-Bolland, 229 F.

Supp. 473 (1964). There is a similar problem in Question 13, which asks:

"Has the defendant admitted involvement in the offense?" There sometimes

is legitimate doubt on whether words used by the person arrested do or do

not amount to an admission of guilt. U.S. v. Littlejohn, 260 F. Supp. 278,

282 (1966). Hence your fact for bail hearing purposes is what the accused

said, not the legal effect of his words.

In any instance in which information is given to the United

States Attorney or a member of his staff by filling out Bail Reform Act

Form No. 1, place in the case file an exact copy of whatever was given to

the United States Attorney's office.

Bureau instructions presently require that an office requesting

apprehension by another office shall include in the request those available

facts pertinent to the bail hearing. The extent of the facts so furnished now

is governed by Bail Reform Act Form No. 1, insofar as they are available

to the requesting office.

Some commissioners may elect to not use the form. The form

is not required by the statute, and the Department of Justice has no power to

compel a judicial officer to use it. Even so, the United States Attorney may

want you to use the form for his purposes.

By agreement between the Department of Justice and the

Administrative Office of the United States Courts, all federal investigative

agencies will obtain their supplies of this form from the Clerks of the

District Courts. Obtain your supplies locally in this manner.

(C) DEMONSTRATIONS PROTESTING UNITED STATES INTERVENTION

IN VIETNAM (VIDEM) -- Current Bureau instructions require that all

information developed regarding such demonstrations be submitted to

the Bureau by teletype for immediate dissemination to the White House

and other interested Government agencies; followed by a letterhead

memorandum for routine dissemination to the intelligence community.

In addition, certain offices submit quarterly reports concerning

demonstrations which have occurred during the previous three months.

Continue to submit teletypes as instructed; however, ef-

fective immediately, a separate letterhead memorandum regarding each

routine demonstration should be discontinued. In the future each office

should transmit to the Bureau by the close of business each Monday a

letterhead memorandum reporting on demonstrations during the past

week.

Oftices submitting quarterly reports are to discontinue

them. In order to facilitate handling at the Seat of Government, all

communications reporting on antiwar demonstrations are to be furnished

the Bureau under the VIDEM caption. Discontinue the use of organi-

zational captions. Continue to include pertinent information concerning

activity in demonstrations in organizational and individual reports where

applicable.

During your coverage of demonstrations you should be

particularly alert to violations of various federal laws such as the

Selective Service Act. All criminal violations should be reported under

the appropriate caption.

The Bureau will issue separate instructions concerning the

coverage of and the reporting on major demonstrations.

(D) RACIAL INFORMANTS - SECURITY INFORMANTS -- In view of the

continuing stress we are placing on our informants, you should insure

that all interviews conducted with informants are exacting and thorough.

Special Agents handling informants (racial and security) must be cognizant

of the fact that much of the information furnished by these informants is

being disseminated promptly to key Government officials as well as local

authorities. In view of this, every interview conducted with a racial or

security informant should be such that no "loose ends" are left hanging

and that all information available to the informant is obtained at time

of interview.

In addition, you are reminded that Special Agents should not

merely collect information from informants but also direct their activities

in order that the Bureau will obtain the full benefit of the informant's

potential.

(E) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- Based upon a

recommendation made by the recently concluded racial matters con-

ferences, the following change concerning the handling of oral infor-

mation furnished by racial informants is being placed in effect. It will

be no longer necessary to authenticate information furnished orally by

a racial informant except in those instances where the information

could possibly be used in local as well as Federal prosecution. To

avoid duplication of recording information received from an informant

where no prosecution is involved, use may be made of one or a com-

bination of teletype, letterhead memorandum, or memorandum to replace

the informant's statement. All information received from racial in-

formants must, however, be adequately recorded.

In addition, you may now utilize the FD-209 to channelize

observations of racial conditions in ghetto areas where the situation is

described as calm by placing a copy of the FD-209 in the informant's

Sub-A file and in the appropriate control file covering racial violence.

Appropriate Manual change will be furnished.

April 2, 1968

(A) ARRESTS - SEARCHES AND SEIZURES -- In Niro v. U.S.,

decided 2/2/68 but not yet reported, the Court of Appeals, First

Circuit, reversed the conviction in a case in which Bureau Agents

obtained evidence in a search of premises incidental to arrest.

Reversal was based on failure to obtain a search warrant for the

premises. The court said, in part, as follows:

"We think it proper to say that while the failure

to obtain a warrant when one could readily have been had

is not of necessity fatal to a search or seizure concomitant

with an arrest the nature of which had been fully anticipated,

it will be fatal unless there are at least some countervailing

factors. We need not define such circumstances. In the case

at bar we find none. We hold that the government cannot rely

upon an expected arrest to seize stolen goods, the presence

of which it long had probable cause to know of, simply to

avoid the inconvenience of obtaining a search warrant."

This decision reinstates, for the First Circuit, the rule of

Trupiano v. U.S., 334 U.S. 699 (1948), in which the Supreme Court heid that

the failure to obtain a search warrant, when there was full opportunity to

do so, invalidated what would otherwise have been a search justified by the

arrest. This rule was thought to have been discarded in U.S. V. Rabinowitz,

339 U.S. 56 (1950), in which the Supreme Court said, in part, that:

"To the extent that Trupiano v. United States . . .

requires a search warrant solely upon the basis of the

practicability of procuring it rather than upon the reasonable-

ness of the search after a lawful arrest, that case is overruled.

The relevant test is not whether it is reasonable to procure a

search warrant, but whether the search was reasonable. That

criterion in turn depends upon the facts and circumstances - the

total atmosphere of the case."

The principal effect of Niro on Bureau offices in the First

Circuit (Boston and San Juan) is obvious.

In any case in which the Agents

have advance probable cause for believing that instrumentalities, fruits and

contraband of the crime in question are located on certain premises where

an arrest is expected and it is practicable to obtain a warrant without

jeopardizing the case, they must obtain a search warrant for those premises

and thus search on the authority of the warrant rather than on that of the

arrest to which the search otherwise would be incidental. There will be

exceptions.

The holding of the court, quoted above, expressly requires a

search warrant "

... when one could readily have been had. ..," therefore,

the first exception would be justified where the facts are persuasive that the

search warrant could not "readily have been had." The elements of proof that

might be involved here are: (1) How much time elapsed between the receipt

of probable cause for the search and the moment of arrest in the premises?

In the Niro case this period was described by the court as being "over twelve

hours." In a different case, a significantly reduced lapse of time may result

in a First Circuit decision contrary to that in Niro. (2) Was the issuing

magistrate available when needed? Inquiry by the Agents might show that

even though they have collected facts they believe are sufficient to establish

probable cause they are unable to present them for consideration by the

magistrate because he is not readily available. Thus, the unavailability of

the magistrate indicates that a search warrant could not "readily have been

had." (3) Did the probable cause to search obtained by the Agents relate to

subject matter not covered by Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal

• Procedure, such as items of mere evidence? If so, a search warrant could

not "readily have been had" for those items while at the same time the

search for those items would have been justified incidental to the arrest

in the premises.

Further, the court's holding provides that even where a

search warrant could "readily have been had" there may be "some

countervailing factors" which would justify exception to the announced

rule. They declined to specify the nature of such factors, stating only that

they found none in the Niro case. This effectively leaves open an avenue

of escape for the court in future cases if they find the rule is largely

unworkable in the practical world of law enforcement. Therefore, if the

• NW 55069 DocId:32989528 Page 876

## Page 877

circumstances of a case are such that there appears strong reason, aside

from mere inconvenience, for failing to obtain a search warrant when one

could readily have been had, good judgment on the scene must control. This

assumes consultation, if possible, with the principal legal advisor and with

the United States Attorney, prior to taking any action in this regard.

Obviously, the facts, circumstances and needs of each investigation differ

and without the context it is impossible to predict, with any satisfactory

degree of precision, what "countervailing factors" will be acceptable to the

court. Nevertheless, the court said such factors may be considered and

this advantage should not be overlooked where it might be useful.

Boston and San Juan should anticipate that in any search of

premises incidental to arrest, without a search warrant, in which the Agents

find instrumentalities, etc., which they had advance reason to believe were

there, the courts of the First Circuit will require the government to either

justify the failure to obtain a search warrant or forego use of the evidence

found.

The Niro decision raises the question of what to do when an

arrest is to be made, possibly on premises under the control of the accused,

for an offense involving things subject to search and seizure and believed to

be on those premises, and a search warrant for the premises has been applied

for and denied. You are instructed that if the arrest is made on the premises

in question, you are to search those premises for the instrumentalities, fruits,

contraband, and evidence of the offense in the usual manner of search

incidental to arrest. Rabinowitz and the recent decision of the Supreme

Court in Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294 (1967), are your authority for

the position that the existence or nonexistence of a search warrant for those

premises is not conclusive on the duty and authority of an officer to search

premises incidental to arrest therein. You should be careful, however, to

avoid timing the arrest in such a way that the court can legitimately draw the

conclusion that you passed up a clear opportunity to arrest the accused outside

the premises in question for the deliberate purpose of arresting inside the

premises and thus using the power of incidental search to bypass the search

warrant requirement. This does not mean that you must follow a policy of

arresting outside the premises when you have no search warrant for the

premises. There are legitimate reasons for arresting an accused inside

his dwelling rather than outside, one of which is the fact that when arresting

an accused believed to be dangerous, an arrest inside the premises offers

less danger to the public. See Leahy v. U.S., 272 F2d 487 (1959), cert. dism.

364 U.S. 945; Morales v. U.S., 344 F2d 846, 850 (1965).

Offices other than Boston and San Juan are not immediately

affected by the Niro decision. But the decision should be another warning to

lay particular stress on the desirability of obtaining search warrants ( as well

as arrest warrants) whenever there is reasonable opportunity to do so. The

Niro decision may be persuasive on courts in other circuits. For example,

the Fifth Circuit (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and

Texas) has shown some leaning toward views like those expressed in Niro.

Barnett v. U.S., 384 F2d 848 (1967); Williams v. U.S., 382 F2d 48 (1967).

The Niro rule on premises could easily be extended to searches

of vehicles in a non-mobile condition or even to those in a mobile condition in

cases where the facts known to the officers were such that they could accurately

predict the location of the vehicle at a time of planned arrest therein. See

Clay v. U.S., 239 F2d 196 (1956); U.S. v. Kendrick, 266 F. Supp. 718 (1967).

Advise all investigative personnel and direct your Legal

Instructor to follow this matter closely.

(B) REPORT WRITING - ADMINISTRATIVE HANDLING OF FORM

FD-302 -- There are attached herewith standardized instructions concerning

the administrative handling of Form FD-302.

As the result of consultations with Chief Clerks, and certain

Special Agents in Charge, and the findings of the Inspection Division, it

has been determined that there is an absolute need to standardize the

handling of Form FD-302. The consensus was that this procedure was

practical for field-wide use, efficient and it would fix responsibility for

proper handling of FD-302.

Advise all personnel of the instructions set

out in the attached procedures and place these instructions into effect

immediately.

Manual revisions will be forthcoming.

(C) SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS -- The emergence

of the new left movement as a subversive force dedicated to the complete

destruction of the traditional values of our democratic society presents

the Bureau with an unprecedented challenge in the security field.

Although the new left has no definable ideology of its own, it does

have strong Marxist, existentialist, nihilist and anarchist overtones.

While mere membership in a new left group is not sufficient to establish

that an individual is a potential threat to the internal security of the

United States, it must be recognized that many individuals affiliated

with the new left movement do, in fact, engage in violence or unlawful

activities, and their potential dangerousness is clearly demonstrated

by their statements, conduct and actions.

The Bureau has recently noted that in many instances

security investigations of these individuals are not being initiated.

In some cases, subjects are not being recommended for inclusion on

the Security Index merely because no membership in a basic revolutionary

organization could be established. Since the new left is basically

anarchist, many of the leading activists in it are not members of any

basic revolutionary group. It should be borne in mind that even if a

subject's membership in a subversive organization cannot be proven,

his inclusion on the Security Index may often be justified because of

activities which establish his anarchistic tendencies. In this regard,

you should constantly bear in mind that the public statements, the

writings and the leadership activities of subjects of security investi-

gations which establish them as anarchists are proper areas of

inquiry. Such activity should be actively pursued through investigation

with the ultimate view of including them on the Security Index. It is

entirely possible, therefore, that a subject without any organizational

affiliation can qualify for the Security Index by virtue of his public pronounce-

ments and activities which establish his rejection of law and order and

reveal him to be a potential threat to the security of the United States.

It is equally important to understand that mere dissent and

opposition to Governmental policies pursued in a legal constitutional

manner are not sufficient to warrant inclusion in the Security Index.

You

are reminded that one of the four criteria in Section 87D, Manual of

Instructions, must apply. Further, in those cases requiring Bureau

authority to initiate investigations, your requests must summarize

information available to show the potential threat and not merely

show anti-Vietnam or peace group sentiments without also revealing

advocacy of violence or unlawful action which would justify an

investigation.

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

April 9, 1968

(A) U. S. SAVINGS BONDS CAMPAIGN - 1968 -- The 1968 bond drive

sponsored by the U. S. Treasury Department will commence this year

on April 18, 1968, and will be concluded on June 14, 1968. The Treasury

Department has set 80% employee participation as its target for this

year. Of our 15, 556 employees, a total of 7, 446 are presently buying

Series E bonds and U. S. Savings Notes for an employee participation

rate of only 47. 9%. Obviously there is room for a great deal of improve-

ment when comparing our rate of participation with the target. A list

of nonparticipants will be furnished you prior to April 18, 1968, so each

may be personally contacted and encouraged to join the program through

good salesmanship without any pressure whatsoever.

Nonsubscribers should be made aware that the purchase

of savings bonds helps the Nation's finances and represents a solid

personal investment. The Bureau's payroll deductior service con-

cerning the bond program facilitates such savings. As little as $3.75

a pay period may be withheld for the purchase of Series E bonds and

$3.90 for the combination purchase of Series E bonds and U. S. .

Savings Notes. Series E bonds yield 4. 15% when held to their 7 year

maturity and may be cashed in after 2 months if the need arises.

U: S. Savings Notes yield 4. 74% compounded semiannually when held

to maturity of only 4 1/2 years and they may be redeemed after 1 year.

If held to maturity, Series E bonds will pay $4 for every $3 invested.

Series E bonds are issued in face amounts of $25, $50, $75, $100,

$200, $500, and $1,000 whereas U. S. Savings Notes are issued only

in face amounts of $25, $50, $75, and $100.

Make certain you have a sufficient supply on hand of form

FD-308 which is the application to buy Series E bonds as well as form

SF 1192-A, the application to buy the combination Series E bonds and

U. S. Savings Notes. Each nonparticipant should be furnished with

such applications, the advantages of joining personally outlined by the

supervisor, and be followed up to secure your employees' expressed

interest. Completed applications should be furnished promptly to the

Voucher-Statistical Section as received by you since a weekly report of

our progress must be furnished to the U.S. Treasury Department during

the span of the drive. The official Bureau name and the correct Social

Security number must be used on the forms. These forms should either

be typed or printed in ink. At the conclusion of the drive Voucher-

Statistical Section will send you a report which will reveal any success

attained from your efforts in spearheading this year's drive. Over eight

million Americans are using this effortless means to save and those

buying bonds are providing for their future.

(B) LINEUPS - IDENTIFICATION BY PHOTOGRAPH -- On March 18,

1968, the United States Supreme Court approved the pre-arrest use of

photographs for identification. Simmons v. U.S., -

U.S.

36 LW 4227 (1968).

A savings and loan association was held up by two men

who left the scene in a vehicle that was located and identified the same

day. Through this lead, group pictures, in which Simmons and others

appeared, were obtained.

On the day following the robbery, these

photographs were exhibited by Agents to savings and loan employees

who identified Simmons as one of the subjects. Simmons was convicted

and appealed, contending his pretrial identification through the use of

photographs was improper.

The Court looked to the "totality of surrounding circumstances"

to determine that the photographic identification, as used in this case, did

not deny Simmons due process of law or call for reversal under the Court's

supervisory authority.

The Court, in reaching its decision, considered the following:

(1) It was a pre-arrest situation involving a serious crime

and the identity of the subjects had not been definitely established at the time

the photographs were exhibited to the eyewitnesses.

(2) The eyewitnesses had an opportunity during the robbery

to observe the subjects for an appreciable period under conditions indicating

a good possibility of subsequent valid identifications.

(3) Photographs were exhibited to the witnesses the day

followins the commission of the crime "while their memories were still

(4) At least six photographs were exhibited to each witness.

Subject's picture appeared in several of the photographs and the Court noted

". . . it probably would have been preferable for the witnesses to have been

shown more than six snapshots, for those snapshots to have pictured a

greater number of individuals, and for there to have been proportionally

fewer pictures of Simmons."

SAC LETTER 68-22

NW 55069

DocId: 32989528 Page 882

## Page 883

(5) The photographs were shown to each witness individually.

They were told nothing concerning the progress of the investigation and no

suggestions were made indicating which person in the photographs was under

suspicion.

(6) The initial identifications were confirmed by all witnesses

in subsequent viewings of photographs and by in-court identifications which

stood up on cross-examination.

The Court stated that the sum of these circumstances left

little room for doubt that the identification was proper.

The Court pointed out that where there are multiple eyewitnesses

"The reliability of the identification procedure could have been increased by

allowing only one or two of the five eyewitnesses to view the pictures oi

Simmons. If thus identified, Simmons could later have been displayed to the

other eyewitnesses in a lineup, thus permitting the photographic identification

to be supplemented by a corporeal identification, which is normally more

accurate."

In connection with another point in the case, the Court

indicated that all photographs shown to a witness should be maintained so

they will be available if called for by the court. These photographs, properly

identified, are to be maintained as exhibits in the case file.

As to future cases involving the use of photographs for

identification, the Court held "

.. • that each case must be considered

on its own facts, and that convictions based on eyewitness identification

at trial following a pretrial identification by photograph will be set aside.

only if the photographic identification procedure was so impermissibly

suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable

misidentification."

This decision, like U.S. v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218 (1967);

Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263 (1967); and Stovall v. Denno, 218 U.S.

293 (1967), indicates the continuing interest of the Court in the identification

process.

Safeguards are established to insure the reliability of eyewitness

identification by subjecting the use of photographs for identification to

scrutiny of the courts on the issue of admissibility

• To insure compliance, you are instructed to use photographs

for identification purposes only where good judgment indicates it is necessary.

The "necessity" for use of photographs for identification

arises where there is compelling need to identify a subject who has not been

sufficiently identified through other investigation.

A serious question as to the validity of any photographic

identification is raised if the witness did not have adequate opportunity

to observe the subject so that it is reasonable to believe the witness could

make a valid identification. Resort to use of photographs for identification

purposes in this situation only where no other reasonable possibility of

identifying the subject exists.

The procedure utilized in exhibiting photographs for

identification is of equal importance to avoid suggestive or coercive

influences. Display subject's photograph to witnesses in a group of at

least five other photographs which depict persons resembling the subject

as nearly as possible. In the event there are multiple eyewitnesses, attempt

to identify the subject by displaying the photographs to only a few of them.

The remaining witnesses should view subject at a subsequent lineup, which

should result in a more reliable identification.

The photographs must not be viewed by a witness in the

presence of any other witness.

Do not, in any way, indicate which photograph is that

of the suspect. In addition, do not reveal to the witness the status of

the investigation as this would possibly indicate to him that the suspect

has been otherwise identified and his photograph is among those being

shown.

SAC Letter 67-61 (A) stated that photographic identification

may be used in the event the accused refuses to participate in a lineup

and no method of compelling him to do so is found. Continue to follow

these instructions.

Advise all investigative personnel.

(D) ARRESTS - SEARCHES AND SEIZURES - SEARCH WARRANTS;

ARREST WARRANTS -- The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has, in

effect, instructed all United States Commissioners in Illinois, Indiana and

Wisconsin to cease drafting affidavits and, presumably, complaints.

In U.S. v. Pascente, 387 F2d 923 (1967), the Seventh Circuit approved

an affidavit for a search warrant which was described as ". . . a printed

form filled in and completed in what is obviously a hasty handwritten

scrawl, replete with abbreviations (some of them rather unconventional)

and composed in a highly cryptic style... ." It is noted that although the

affidavit was signed by an FBI Agent, it was prepared by a United States

commissioner and this practice was condemned by the court. Rule 41 (c),

Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which is controlling, contemplates

that the affidavit will be prepared by the affiant and not by the Commissioner.

Reversal was not ordered on this point because no prejudice to the defendant

was shown in this case. But, the court said, ". . . nevertheless, a practice

of having the Commissioner prepare any such affidavits should be disapproved

in order that it will not recur in any districts of this circuit." The

defendant's petition to the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari in this

case was filed February 23, 1968; however, until advised to the contrary

offices located in the Seventh Circuit must accept the Court of Appeals

decision as binding on this point.

The immediate effect of this decision is that FBI Agents in

the Chicago, Springfield, Indianapolis and Milwaukee Divisions hereafter

must write their own affidavits and complaints, excepting only those situations

in which the United States Attorney or an Assistant does the composition with

information supplied by the Agent. In this regard, Agents writing their own

affidavits and complaints will be assisted as necessary by the principal

Legal Instructor. The statement of probable cause may be prepared on a

separate sheet prior to appearing before the magistrate and simply attached

and incorporated by reference when the formal affidavit or complaint is.

filed. Using this method, there should be little justification for hastily

drawn statements that would merit the criticism expressed by the Seventh

Circuit.

Though they are not technically bound by it, courts and/or

United States Commissioners in Federal Districts outside of the Seventh

Circuit may be persuaded to follow the rule announced in the Pascente case.

Therefore, the Legal Instructor in your office should alert all investigative

personnel to this recent development in the law and re-entorce previous

instructions that Agents are to rely on the advice and assistance of the

United States Attorney and the United States Commissioner where possible.

However, we must anticipate that in some districts and circuits this

assistance may be limited or non-existent, in which case we have no choice

but to prepare our own affidavits and complaints. Under such circumstances,

the assistance of the Legal Instructor may be particularly valuable.

(E) BUREAU APPLICANTS - CLERICAL RECRUITMENT PROGRAM -

SEAT OF GOVERNMENT - Recently I was informed by a Special Agent

in Charge of a plan he was utilizing to stimulate clerical recruiting on

the part of Resident Agents. Each Resident Agency in his division was

given a quota. When a Resident Agency did not make its quota, Agents

from that Resident Agency were assigned on a rotating basis to do

investigations on applicants recruited in a Resident Agency where the

quota had been met or exceeded. This proved to be very successful

and, where practical, you should take immediate steps to implement

this technique in your office.

I realize that in some offices such a technique would be

impractical due to the distances between Resident Agencies and would

result in the excessive expenditure of funds and manpower.

Each

Special Agent in Charge should thoroughly analyze his recruitment program

to see if such a technique can be implemented. Other similar techniques

have proven successful. One technique is to send a group of Agents into

Resident Agency territories to locate, interview and test prospective appli-

cants. If the applicants are found to possess the basic qualifications

investigations are ordered and assigned to other Agent personnel not

directly responsible for those recruited. Another technique is to send

Agent personnel into Resident Agency territories to work the cases

developed by the Resident Agents, particularly where the Resident Agency

has a heavy case load.

Although the above techniques have been utilized in connection with

recruiting in Resident Agency territories, serious consideration should be

given to utilizing them in Headquarters City also, to insure that each

Agent is equitably sharing in this most vital program. This matter

will be carefully looked into during the course of the inspection of

your office.

(F) TOP ECHELON CRIMINAL INFORMANT PROGRAM -- As you have

previously been informed, the Bureau has heavy commitments in con-

nection with the drive against organized crime. To appropriately dis-

charge your responsibilities, it is mandatory that you have a skillfully

devised and executed program to obtain adequate top-level informant

coverage.

A principal objective of your Top Echelon Criminal Informant

Program must be the penetration of La Cosa Nostra with member-informants.

The importance of developing such sources cannot be overemphasized. An

accurate picture with respect to the prevalence of La Cosa Nostra within

your territory cannot be clearly established without such sources.

Your Top Echelon Criminal Informant Program must also

be aimed at the development of informants who will enable you to meet

your responsibilities in connection with the antigambling statutes.

Keep in mind that all Special Agents assigned to criminal

intelligence matters share the responsibility for the development of

adequate informant coverage. They must be continually alert to the

possibility of selecting appropriate targets for development for inclusion

in your program.

There is a direct relationship between the effectiveness of

your Criminal Intelligence Program and the quality of your top-level

informant coverage.

You will be held strictly accountable for having an

imaginative and productive Top Echeion Criminal Informant Program.

Your program will continue to be very closely analyzed with this in mind

during future inspections and appropriate administrative action will be

taken against both Agent and supervisory personnel for any failures

detected.

The progress of your Top Echelon Criminal Informant

Program will be closely followed.

(G) INCENDIARISM - RACIAL AND SECURITY INFORMANT COVER-

AGE -- On March 29 and 30, 1968, fires believed to have been

deliberately set were discovered in four major department stores in

the Chicago loop district and in three large department stores in New

York City. Two of these fires were started by Molotov cocktails and

a Molotov cocktail which failed to ignite was found in a fourth New York

department store.

Although the Bureau has no jurisdiction in these matters

based upon the information developed to date, there is a possibility

of the involvement on the part of extremist elements in either the racial

or nationality field. In addition, past experience has shown that acts

of this nature which receive wide publicity often serve as a catalyst

in other areas for extremist groups and fanatic individuals.

Accordingly, this points out the absolute necessity for

having maximum informant penetration of these extremist groups

(racial and nationality) as well as full coverage of the ghettos (white

and black) by racial informants in order to obtain advance intelligence.

It is also to be noted that in the recent past there has been a large

number of acts of incendiarism against American-owned businesses in

Puerto Rico in which Puerto Rican nationalists have been suspected.

In the event such arson activity as described above occurs

in your respective divisions, you should give specific assignments to

informants to determine if any extremist groups or individuals are

behind these events. In addition, you should maintain close liaison with

the local police departments in order to be kept promptly advised of

information which may be of interest to the Bureau.

MENT OF JUSTICE -- The functions of the Bureau of Narcotics,

Department of the Treasury, and Bureau of Drug Abuse Control,

Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, (except the regulation

of the counterfeiting of those drugs which are not controlled "depressant

The Attorney General has created in the Department of

Justice a Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs which will perform

the aforementioned functions transferred to the Attorney General.

All complaints previously referred to the Bureau of Narcotics or the

Bureau of Drug Abuse Control concerning matters previously within

(B) WHITE MILITANT GROUPS - RACIAL MATTERS

(ORGANIZATION) -- In view of increasing militancy in the racial

field, neighborhood groups whose members are of the white race,

have been springing up throughout the United States. Some of these

groups appear to be militant in nature and some urge the white man to

arm himself as a means of protection against racial violence. Some of

these groups are known to sponsor demonstrations against integration

and against the bussing of Negro students to white schools. Others

appear to advocate more violent methods of opposition to integration.

The appearance of these groups is noted mostly in the white ghetto

areas of the large cities which border on minority group living areas.

In order to fulfill our responsibilities in the racial

intelligence field we must be cognizant of the groups and their aims

and purposes. Upon receipt of information as to the formation or

existence of such a group, a preliminary investigation should be

immediately initiated to determine the aims and purposes of the organ-

ization, its leaders, approximate membership, as well as any pertinent

background data which will assist in determining the militancy of the

group.

From information presently available, it appears that

many of these organizations have been founded on principles of fear

rather than hate and as such, they cannot be classified as hate groups.

Your investigations should, therefore, be discreet and most circumspect.

You should limit your inquiries to a review of Bureau files, contacts with

Bureau informants, and established sources, and the use of public

source information.

Upon completion of your investigations, a communication

in form suitable for dissemination should be forwarded to the Bureau

together with a recommendation as to whether additional investigation

is warranted under Section 122A of the Manual of Instructions as it

pertains to the investigation of Klan and white hate groups.

In addition to the above, I wish to point out to you the

possibility of reactions by the Klan, white hate groups, and residents

of white ghetto areas to the recent wave of racial disorders resulting

from the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. You should remain

alert to this possibility. Informant coverage of the Klan, white hate

groups, and white ghetto areas must be intensified so that plans of

retaliation or overt action are known to the Bureau prior to their taking .

place.

(C) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- In order to further

streamline the racial informant program, effective immediately it will

no longer be necessary to advise the Bureau the identity of an individual

being operated as a probationary racial informant (ghetto) nor will it

be necessary to obtain prior Bureau authority to operate this individual

except in the instances set out below.

In the event an individual is connected with an educational

institution, a legitimate civil rights organization, employed in a

sensitive position or in the news media field, or is a member of the

military, prior Bureau authority must be obtained before contacting

this individual to develop him as an informant. If an individual is to

be operated in an extremist organization such as a militant black

nationalist group, Klan group, or white hate group, Bureau approval

must be obtained to designate him as an informant.

The criteria for developing as well as the required

investigation for probationary racial informant (ghetto) set out in

Section 130, Volume IV, Manual of Instructions, remains in effect,

except that now the personal authority of the Special Agent in Charge

is required to operate an individual as a ghetto informant.

An individual may be operated as a probationary racial

informant (ghetto) as long as he continues to furnish information of a

racial nature. Contact must be made with this individual on the same

basis as other racial informants as set out in Section 130 referred to •

above.

In the event a probationary racial informant (ghetto) is

able to infiltrate a militant black organization or a white hate or

Klan group, the Bureau must be advised and Bureau authority obtained

to delete the "ghetto" from his designation. At such time as it is

recommended he be operated in an extremist organization, the full

investigation required for probationary racial informants should be

conducted.

If a ghetto racial informant is furnishing information on

a regular basis and it is desired to pay him on a regular basis,

specific Bureau authorization must be obtained. The request to pay

this individual on a regular basis should be submitted in accordance

with the instructions set out in Section 130G, 2, Volume IV, Manual

of Instructions.

•á.

There is no objection to paying a ghetto informant under

SAC authority up to $400 as set out in SAC Letter 68-16 dated March 12,

1968, captioned "Racial Informants, Racial Matters." However, you

must insure that full value is received for any payments made and that

these payments are made on a c.o.d. basis.

After a ghetto informant has been operated for a sufficient

period of time to evaluate his reliability and stability and it is desired

to remove him from probation, a recommendation should be made to

the Bureau in accordance with the instructions set out in Section 130

concerning the removal of racial informants from probation.

As I previously advised, you are expected to develop

ghetto informants at a regular rate.

Your progress in this matter

will be followed through the annual field Inspections as well as through

analysis of your submission of the FD-372 captioned "Racial Informant

Monthly Progress Letter. " Effective immediately, you should include

in your monthly letter the specific number of ghetto informants you

have at the beginning of the month, the number added during the month,

(A) STUDENT NONVIOLENT COORDINATING COMMITTEE

(SNCC) - RACIAL MATTERS - SNCC -- The militant black

nationalist Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)

sponsored a conference of Negro college students at Tougaloo

College, Tougaloo, Mississippi, on April 13-14, 1968. An

informant has reported that violent, Mau Mau-type tactics were

discussed at this conference.

At this conference it was mentioned that Negro

college graduates should be encouraged to infiltrate all police

schools in order to work within all law enforcement agencies.

Also discussed was the possibility of mapping the homes of

chiefs of police and mayors so Mau Mau-type tactics could be

used to eliminate these officials.

You should be constantly alert to the possibility of

infiltration of this Bureau in connection with applicant recruiting.

You should also alert law enforcement officials within your

territory to the above matters during your routine contacts with

them.

(D) CHINESE NAMES -- A trend has been noted in recént months in

a number of field offices involving the improper reporting of Chinese

names, both in the title and body of communications. The proper

reporting of Chinese names is essential not only for purposes of

thorough investigation but also to insure accurate and correct indexing.

The Manual of Instructions, Section 105F, pages 4i, 4n and 40, clearly

sets forth the correct manner of reporting Chinese names, including

the necessity for obtaining Chinese Telegraphic Code (CTC) numbers

or Chinese Characters Whenever possible. You should insure that all

Agent and clerical personnel who have occasion to handle Chinese

investigations or to process mail in these cases are thoroughly familiar

with the above-cited manual provisions.

In cases where the CTC numbers for a Chinese subject's

name have not been secured, the office of origin should make reference

to this fact when preparing communications setting out leads for

auxiliary offices so that latter offices can be alert to obtain the CTC

numbers or characters in handling their respective leads. In addition,

the office of origin should keep the Bureau advised of specific efforts

being made to obtain the CTC numbers or Chinese characters of a

subject's name.

(E) INVESTIGATION OF THE NEW LEFT - STUDENT AGITATION ON

COLLEGE CAMPUSES -- In recent weeks, violent student demonstrations

have erupted on college campuses throughout the Nation. Student activists

responsible for initiating these demonstrations are, for the most part,

affiliated with the Students for a Democratic Society and other new left

groups currently under investigation or campus-based black nationalist

groups. The pattern of radical dissent on the campus has changed

abruptly from the sit-ins and nonviolent demonstrations of the past to

the recent attempts by student activists to physically seize control of

colleges and universities through violent means.

The most recent outbreak of violence on college campuses

represents a direct challenge to law and order and a substantial threat

to the stability of society in general. The Bureau has an urgent and

pressing responsibility to keep the intelligence community informed of

plans of new left groups and student activists to engage in acts of law-

lessness on the campus. We can only fulfill this responsibility through

the development of high quality informants who are in a position to

report on the plans of student activists to engage in disruptive activities

on the campus.

In view of the increased agitational activity taking place on

college campuses, each office is instructed to immediately expand both

its coverage and investigation of campus-based new left groups and

black nationalist organizations with the objective of determining in

advance the plans of these elements to engage in violence or disruptive

• activities on the campus. It cannot be too strongly emphasized that all

offices are expected to develop and maintain adequate sources to enable

the Bureau to determine in advance and promptly report agitational

activities being planned by campus-based groups. In carrying out these

instructions, you should, of course, be guided by existing regulations

which require that Bureau authorization be obtained prior to the develop-

ment of informants and sources on college campuses.

Information developed relating to disruptive activities planned

or initiated by campus-based new left or black nationalist groups should

be immediately furnished to the Bureau by teletype, followed by a letter-

head memorandum under a caption descriptive of the activity. The

character to be utilized will be governed by the nature of the activity. It

is not desired that routine antiwar demonstrations which occur on the

campus be reported under this caption however; and offices should

continue to comply with instructions contained in SAC Letter 68-20 (C)

in reporting these demonstrations.

This matter should be afforded continuous aggressive in-

vestigative attention to insure that the Bureau's responsibilities in

this field are properly discharged.

(A) SPEAKER IDENTIFICATION -- As you have been previously advised,

the Laboratory has the equipment and competent personnel to analyze

and compare known and questioned recordings of an individual's voice

for the purpose of speaker identification. The use of visual voice patterns

provides information which may not be perceptible to the ear and there-

fore, is a valuable supplement to the ear in any analysis or comparison

of voices and other complex sounds. Therefore, this type of examination

will continue to be offered to provide investigative guidance in selected

Bureau investigations.

Although there has been considerable research effort in

recent years, current techniques of comparing voices for speaker identi-

fication are still considered experimental and not sufficiently authenti-

cated to serve as a unique means of identification with subsequent court

testimony to that effect. The use of sound spectrograms or voiceprints

for speaker identification continues to receive wide publicity. The

comparison in the press of voiceprints to fingerprints as a means of

identification has created some confusion and misunderstanding. Voice-

prints are not analogous to fingerprints. While fingerprints do not

change in pattern, the voice and the resulting voiceprint pattern may be

affected by emotions or distorted by the communications channel through

which the sound travels. For the above reasons and because of some

technical variations and limitations associated with tape recordings,

the comparison of voices for speaker identification and the examination

of tape recordings are not services which are currently being offered

to local law enforcement agencies.

The procedures set forth in the Manual of Instructions, Section

8Q, should be followed in obtaining and transmitting voice recordings for

comparison.

(B) TELETYPES - MAILING OF TO BUREAU -- Manual of Rules and

Regulations, Part II, Section 4, Item G4b, Pages 36 and 37, requires

that when communication is being sent to one or more field offices

by teletype and Bureau also is to be notified but circumstances do not

warrant sending to Bureau by teletype, original typed blue copy of

teletype is to be mailed to Bureau and submitting office should prepare

additional blue copy for its file.

Teletype should be addressed to

Director and SACs of other receiving offices and word "Mail" typed

in parentheses after Director and Bureau file number. SAC's

approval signature must be on original being sent to Bureau.

A number of instances have occurred recently wherein this

regulation is not being followed and Bureau has been receiving unsigned

copies of teletypes by mail. To facilitate handling at Seat of Government,

these instructions should be reiterated to appropriate personnel and you

should insure they are strictly adhered to in future.

(C) FEDERAL WAGERING TAX STAMPS - INTERNAL REVENUE

SERVICE RECORDS - INTERSTATE GAMBLING ACTIVITIES -- On

January 29, 1968, the United States Supreme Court handed down

decisions in two Internal Revenue Service cases, namely, Grosso v.

United States and Marchetti v. United States, in which it was ruled that

information furnished by an individual to comply with the Federal

wagering tax laws cannot later be used against him if he desires to

declare the privilege against self-incrimination.

As a result of the foregoing decisions, the Department of

Justice has recommended the following two guidelines be adopted in

investigating gambling offenses: (1) refrain from examining or obtaining

by any means information in the files of the Internal Revenue Service

concerning persons who hold wagering occupational tax stamps and wino

file or have filed wagering tax returns; (2) desist from including

references to a person's wagering tax forms in all affidavits filed in

support of search warrants.

The Department of Justice points out that they are con-

tinuing to research the feasibility of further pursuit of prosecution in

those cases in which verification of a subject's compliance with the

Federal wagering tax laws has already been made or where warrants

have been previously issued in Internal Revenue Service cases involving

a failure to file or register under the wagering tax laws. It is possible

that independent sources may be relied upon and legai means can be

implemented to avoid application of the "fruit of the poisonous tree"

doctrine or a defendant's successful refuge under the Fifth Amendment.

Each Special Agent in Charge should immediately apprise

personnel of the foregoing prohibitions in the review and use of Federal

wagering tax information.

The two guidelines recommended by the

Department should be strictly adhered to in the future investigation of

gambling cases, and such guidelines should be borne in mind in all

prosecutive Bureau cases.

Furthermore, each gambling case currently pending, wherein

Federal wagering tax data has already been secured, should be promptly

discussed with the appropriate United States Attorney. In this connection,

you should note the Department's continued research directed toward

6/4/68

SAC LETTER 68-32

-3 -

NW 55069 DocId: 32989528 Page 902

---

## Page 903

possible alternatives in cases where Internal Revenue Service wagering

tax data has already been secured or utilized. Close contacts should

be maintained with the appropriate United States Attorney's office in

these cases to insure no unnecessary investigation is conducted or,

where appropriate, logical investigation is undertaken to develop

prosecutive violations which will be free from the applicability of the

Grosso and Marchetti decisions.

(D) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- Our informants are

reporting more and more information concerning violent statements made

by members of militant black organizations, as well as individual

extremists. Such wild statements could trigger irrational action by

unbalanced individuals.

Recently we have been advised by informants that militant

black nationalist organizations, as well as independent Negro extremists

are talking of taking such action as dynamiting the Empire State Building

in New York City, throwing dynamite on the floor of the New York

Stock Exchange and possibly assassinating some white political candidates

as a means of retaliating for the killing of Martin Luther King, Jr. We

have also received information that militant black racial extremists

feel that all white people should be killed and one has stated that he

believes if the right contact is made with the White House staff, a plan

might be formulated to poison 500 to 600 people attending functions at

the White House.

If any of the actions discussed above were carried out it could

bring about a national catastrophe.

As you have been previously instructed, you must insure

that full details are obtained from informants especially when they are

reporting discussions concerning acts of violence or other dire activities.

With the increased number of violent statements coming to the attention

of the Bureau, you must be alert to promptly run out all rumors of

violence connected with racial activity for the purpose of either proving

or disproving these rumors.

In addition, our experience in the past has shown that often

when an individual is confronted concerning a violent statement he is

alleged to have made, it will deter him from taking any such action.

In view of this, whenever possible, interview individuals who are alleged

to have made violent statements.

These interviews must be well planned

and conducted by two Agents in such a manner that the safety of the Agents !:

will be protected and no incidents will occur which could bring embarrass-

ment to the Bureau. Concerning these interviews you are reminded of

Bureau policy concerning interviews of individuals connected with educational

institutions, the news media and those employed in sensitive positions.

Prior Bureau authority is required concerning interviews with any of the

above-type individuals.

(A) COVERAGE OF DEMONSTRATIONS -- It has previously been

of our coverage of these matters are given prompt and wide

dissemination at the Seat of Government. Many of the demonstrations

(B) DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION REGARDING RACIAL MATTERS --

With increasing frequency, teletypes regarding racial matters are being

received at the Bureau which are not in strict compliance with instructions

set forth in Part II, Section 4, page 41, of the Manual of Rules and

Regulations. These instructions clearly state in detail the manner in

which teletypes should be prepared in order that they can be disseminated

to other Government agencies which are on the Bureau's teletype network.

You should make certain that confidential sources are

appropriately concealed in the text of the teletype and that the teletype

is worded in the same manner as a well-prepared, concise letterhead

memorandum. You should also insure that all administrative data is

set out at the end of the teletype under the heading "Administrative" so

that it may be easily excised.

The provision relating to "Sucop" is not applicable with

regard to racial matters since the submission of a letterhead memorandum

is required in each instance. A Manual change will be forthcoming in

this regard.

(C) INCENDIARY DEVICES - RACIAL MATTERS -- During a recent

inquiry concerning racial violence, an official of the United States Park

Police, Washington, D. C., received information indicating the

possibility of aerosol spray cans containing deodorants being utilized

as incendiary torches. Containers of hair spray and similar products

which are easily obtainable could be put to the same use. Although it

is necessary to maintain an open flame in front of the spray stream,

such as from a cigarette lighter, the effect produced is that of a

blowtorch.

Since this information may be of interest to local law

enforcement agencies in areas where there is a potential for mass

racial violence, those agencies should be appropriately advised.

SAC LETTER 68-34

(D) SECURITY INFORMANTS AND SOURCES - PAYMENTS -- As you

are aware, all security informants and sources receiving compensation

from the Bureau are paid on the basis of the value of information

furnished, services rendered and incurred expenses. Recently, it has

been noted that some informants and sources have been paid consistently

the same amount each month with no variation in payments during

periods when the informants or sources were less productive, which

leads to the illogical implication that information furnished or expenses

incurred or both seldom, if ever, vary. This practice must be

discontinued. Your informants and sources must understand they are

independent contractors remunerated on a C.O. D. basis, and they must

never be led to believe they are recipients of a fixed salary.

This matter will continue to receive careful consideration

at the Seat of Government and you will be held accountable to insure

that payments are for value received and no fixed patterns continue to

develop. These instructions should be called to the attention of all

Special Agents in your office handling security informants and

sources.

(E) VISITORS TO COMMUNIST-BLOC COUNTRIES (COMBLOC) - SAC

Letter 67-65 (E), October 31, 1967, instituted the Combloc survey to

encourage field offices to more fully exploit interviews of visitors to

satellite countries as provided in Manual of Instructions, Section 105G,

and to include visitors to Yugoslavia among those interviewed. The

results of this survey based on statistics submitted by the field offices

to the Bureau have proven the value of this investigative procedure.

Additional individuals who were approached for recruitment by hostile

intelligence services have been uncovered and the field increased coverage

among nationality groups by developing additional sources. Valuable

intelligence information was also furnished to interested United States

Government agencies.

Since the survey has shown successful results can also be

obtained in the Yugoslav field, Yugoslavia should be added to the list of

bloc visitors of. interest to the Bureau as noted in Manual of Instructions,

Section 105G. Each field office should continue to exploit the counter-

intelligence potential in this area of our work with particular emphasis on

the satellite countries and Yugoslavia. Although the Bureau does not

desire additional statistical information at this time, each SAC will be

held responsible to insure that interviews of visitors to communist-bloc

countries are given proper consideration. Obviously, you should be

certain that our responsibilities are fulfilled, within manpower

limitations available to you, so that individuals approached for recruitment

by hostile intelligence services are uncovered.

For your information, approximately 27 per cent of known

visitors were considered for interview during the six-month period of the

survey and about 12 per cent were actually interviewed. In order that you

will be able to afford proper administrative controls over this investigative

procedure and so that the Bureau will be able to solicit pertinent data from

any office in the future, you should channel certain statistical information

to the control file in your office. The control file should reveal at any

given time the number of individuals known to your office to have visited

each specific country and the number actually interviewed. The file

should also contain the identities of individuals compromised, approached

and, or recruited by hostile intelligence; developed as double agents or

potential double agents by your office as a result of these interviews;

developed as sources or informants among nationality groups; and those

cases wherein positive intelligence information was furnished for

dissemination to other United States Government agencies.

Since we have known of very few individuals traveling to

Albania or Bulgaria and none to Mongolia, particular attention should

be given toward interview of visitors to those countries which might

come to the attention of your office.

The code word Combloc used during this past survey should

not be included in the caption of any future correspondence since this

survey as such has been completed. Manual changes will be forthcoming.

(A) DETPRO - SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS OF INDVIDUALS -- The

primary purpose of the investigation of subversive individuals is to

determine their identities, activities, and/or whether they present a

serious threat to the internal security of the country. If investigation

develops positive evidence indicating that an individual presents a

threat or potential threat to the internal security, his name is included

in the Security Index. The Security Index contains names of

individuals who are considered for immediate apprehension and

detention in the event of a national emergency, in order to safeguard

the internal security of the United States. The list now consists of over

10, 000 names. Effective immediately, the following Priority

Apprehension Program and report writing procedures will be instituted:

1. The Priority Apprehension Program is being divided into three

Priority levels.

a. Priority I. This list will consist of hard core national

and state basic revolutionary organization leaders and

those leaders of other subversive organizations and

unorganized groups and individuals who have indicated

a propensity for violence and/or have received special

training in sabotage, espionage, and/or guerrilla warfare.

Individuals employed in or having access to key and/or

defense facilities will be included on this list. Verification

of residence and employment of each individual will be

made every three months. A report will be submitted

every six months.

b.. Priority Il. This list will consist of second level leadership

of basic revolutionary organizations and other subversive

organizations and individuals who present a significant

threat but are in less influential positions than those in

Priority I. Verification of residence and employment of

each individual will be made every six months. A report

will be submitted on an annual basis.

NW 55069 DocId: 32989528 Page 909

c. Priority III. This list will consist of all other individuals

on the Security Index. Verification of residence and •

employment of each individual will be made every six

months. A report will be submitted every two years.

d. Each Priority List will be broken down into nationalistic

tendencies and/or organizational affiliations so that

apprehensions can be made in each category on a selected

basis.

e. Individuals in each Priority will be apprehended only upon

the Attorney General's authorization that their immobilization

is in the best interests of the national defense of the

United States.

• 2. The category "Key Figure" is being deleted. Consideration should be

given to placing these individuals in Priority I.

3. The category "Top Functionary" is being continued, and these

individuals should be placed in Priority I.

• 4. Each office should immediately review its Security Index and by

letter under above caption advise by name, Bureau file number,

• and organizational affiliation those individuals who are to be

included in Priority I and Priority II. This should reach the

Bureau by July 5, 1968.

The Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and

San Francisco Offices may submit their letters to reach the Bureau

by July 15, 1968. Hereafter, when recommending an individual

for the Security Index,, the FD-122 should indicate the Priority.

Appropriate manual changes will be forwarded.

in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 87D of the Manual of

Instructions with consideration being given to placing such individuals on the

Security Index.

It will not be necessary to convert existing files from the 157

classification to files under the other security classifications. Communications

should be submitted utilizing the Security Matter - Minutemen character

regarding individuals and Internal Security - Minutemen character regarding

organizational activities. Reports should follow the outline of regular

security reports although additional information should be included, such

as information relating to any specialized training or knowledge regarding

the use of explosive material or various weapons. Weapons in the possession

of the subject should be set forth as well as a description of the automobile

being utilized.

Each office should thoroughly review informant coverage available

regarding the Minutemen and adequate coverage should be developed

expeditiously. You may consider your coverage adequate at such time as

you can assure the Bureau that you are aware of all Minutemen activity

within your territory. In this regard, each office will submit to the Bureau

within 30 days complete information regarding existing Minutemen informant

coverage. Two categories should be utilized. Existing informants who

report exclusively on Minutemen should be set forth in one category and

existing informants who report on several organizations, such as Minutemen,

Klan and/or racial activity, should be set forth in a separate category.

Informants who report exclusively on Minutemen should henceforth be

handled as security informants in accordance with provisions contained in

Section 107 of the Manual of Instructions. Appropriate review of informant

case files should be made immediately and the Bureau expeditiously advised

of any additional data required.

Each office should submit a complete listing of all Minutemen

members within its territory to reach the Bureau by July 22, 1968. Indicate

field and Bureau file numbers along with the date of the last communication

submitted to the Bureau in each case. Such a listing of members must

its contents, particularly as they pertain to the Bureau's responsibilities.

Title I of the Act authorizes the Federal Government to

assist State and local governments in strengthening and improving law

enforcement at every level. It establishes within the Department of

Justice, under the general authority of the Attorney General, a Law

Enforcement Assictance Administration, hereafter referred to as the

Administration, guided by an administrator and two arsociate adminis-

trators. The Administration will make grants to States and units of

local government to establish law enforcement planning agencies and to

carry out programs and projects to improve and strengthen law enforce-

ment. The Act also establishes within the Department of Justice, under

the general authority of the Administration, a National Institute of Law

Enforcement and Criminal Justice.

The Institute will make grants to

public agencies, institutions of higher education, or private organizations

for research and development to improve and strengthen law enforcement.

Section 404, Title I. authorizes the FBI, under the general

authority of the Attorney General, to (1) establish and conduct training

programs at the FBI National Academy, Quantico, Virginia, to provide.

at the request of a State or unit of local government, training for State

and local law enforcement personnel; (2) develop new or improved ap-

proaches, techniques, assistance, equipment and devices to improve

and strengthen law enforcement; and (3) assist in conducting local and

regional training programs for State and local law enforcement personnel,

when requested to do so by State or units of local government.

Title I

authorizes up to $5, 111, 000 for the implementation of Section 404 during

Fiscal 1969.

The Law Enforcement Assistance Act of 1965 is repealed

by this Act. Loans and grants can be provided to institutions of higher

education for individual educational programs. The Administration will

make rules, regulations and procedures as necessary; it can use the

services, equipment, personnel and facilities of the Department of Justice,

other civilian and military agencies, and instrumentalities of the Federal

Government. The Act specifically prohibits Federal control over State

or local law enforcement agencies.

It authorizes the appropriation of

$100, 111, 000 for implementation of Act during Fiscal 1969 and $300, 000, 000

for Fiscal 1970. Each recipient must keep prescribed records to disclose

amount and disposition of funds to facilitate effective audit.

You will be provided, in other communications, with

additional details regarding the implementation of Section 404, as soon

as funds are appropriated for that purpose.

Title Il purports to abolish the rules laid down by the

Supreme Court in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966); McNabb v.

U.S., 318 U.S. 332 (1943); Mallory v. U.S., 354 U.S. 449 (1957); and

U.S. v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218 (1967), despite the fact that the Miranda

and Wade decisions have a constitutional basis and a statute does not

override the Constitution. McNabb and Mallory are based on the asserted

authority of the judiciary to supervise law enforcement.

The statute states that a confession shall be admissible

in Faderal court if voluntarily given. This is the pre-Escobedo, pre-

Miranda standard. Yet in determining voluntariness, the court may

take into consideration most of the criteria involved under the Miranda

rule. No confession shall be inadmissible solely because of delay in

bringing the arrested person before a judicial officer for a hearing.

This overrules McNabb and Mallory, unless the Court later places the

rule of those decisions on a constitutional basis. Eyewitness testimony

shall be admissible in Federal courts. Here the statute attempts to

override Wade, which holds that such testimony which has been infected

by an improper lineup shall not be admissible.

Make no changes in your interview and lineup procedures

at this time.. Continue to follow the requirements of Miranda on state-

ments and Wade on lineups. Continue without change the present policy

of getting the arrested person before a judicial officer for a hearing as

soon as reasonably possible under the circumstances, subject only to

delay reasonably necessary in the case, such as that for transportation,

booking and a short period for interrogation of an accused who is willing

to make a statement.

Title Ill authorizes interception of wire or oral com-

munications by law enforcement officers pursuant to court order in

specific categories of crime including, among others, violations of

Title 18, U.S. Code, involving espionage, sabotage, treason, murder,

kidnapping, robbery, extortion, various gambling and racketeering

offenses, interstate transportation of stolen property, theft from inter-

state shipment, embezzlement from pension and welfare funds, narcotics,

bribery, and extortionate credit transactions. All statutory restrictions

are lifted, however, from "

• . . the constitutional power of the President

to take such measures as he deems necessary to protect the Nation

against actual or potential attack or other hostile acts of a foreign power,

or to obtain foreign intelligence information deemed essential to the

security of the United States, or to protect national security information

against foreign intelligence activities." or to protect against "overthrow

of the Government by force or other unlawful means, or against any

other clear and present danger to the structure or existence of Govern-

ment." Communications reasonabiy intercepted by this special presi-

dential authority may be used in evidence but not otherwise used or

disclosed except as necessary to implement the presidential power.

A Federal court order requires authorization of the

Attorney General, or designated Assistant Attorney General, for filing

an application by FBI or other Federal law enforcement agency to a

Federal judge. The written application shall identify the officer making

the application and the officer who authorized it, give complete statement

of facts and circumstances relied upon by applicant, including details of

offense which has been, is being, or is about to be committed, nature

and location of place of interception, type of communication sought, and

identity of person, if known, committing the offense or whose communi-

cation is to be intercepted.

The applicant must state whether other in-

vestigative procedures have been tried and failed, period of time for

which interception intended, the history of previous applications involving

same facilities, place, or individuals. Judge may additionally require

applicant to furnish any other testimony or documentary evidence he

believes necessary.

On such application the judge may issue an order

authorizing the surveillance if he finds probable cause for belief that

a person is committing an enumerated offense, that communications

concerning such offense will be obtained through such interception;

that normal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed

or reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too

dangerous; and that the facilities where the interception is to be made

are used, about to be used, leased to, or listed in the name of the

person named in the application.

Similar provisions are made for issuance of such

orders to the Attorney General of a state or the principal attorney

of a political subdivision of a state by a state judge of competent

jurisdiction.

An order authorizing interception of any wire or oral

communication may be issued for no longer than 30 days, with ex-

tensions, as needed, upon reapplication. Emergency situations in-

volving conspiratorial activities which "threaten the national security

or are characteristic of organized crime" enable law enforcement to

intercept without court order if there are grounds upon which an order

could be obtained through prescribed application. In such cases the

application must be made within 48 hours after the emergency inter-

ception has commenced. A permanent recording must be made of all

conversations intercepted pursuant to court order. Such recordings shall

be sealed under directions of the issuing judge.

Within a reasonable time but not later than 90 days after

termination of an authorized surveillance, the judge shall cause to be

served on individuals named in the order, and on such other parties to

intercepted communications as the judge may see fit, an inventory

including notice of existence of the order, date of entry, period author-

ized, and fact that during the period wire or oral communications were

intercepted. On showing of good cause, the judge may postpone the

serving of this inventory.

:

After the Act became law, the Attorney General reaffirmed

his policy that an electronic surveillance will not be authorized except in

cases of a national security nature.

The statute also protects privacy of wire and oral

communications by prohibiting:

(1)

Unauthorized interception of wire or oral com-

munications;

(2)

Unauthorized use of electronic, mechanical or

other device to intercept oral communication;

(3)

Disclosure or use of contents of wire or oral

communication;

(4)

Unauthorized manufacture, distribution, possession

or advertising of electronic, mechanical or other devices primarily

useful for surreptitious interception of wire or oral communication.

Maximum penalty for above violations is fine of not

more than $10, 000 or imprisonment for not more than five years, or

both. In addition, confiscation of intercepting devices used, sold; or

advertised in violation of this statute is authorized.

This Title amends Section 605 of the Communications

Act of 1934 (17 U.S. C. 605) by removing those provisions relating to

interception of wire communications. Such activity is now regulated

by the new Act. An offense can be established by simply showing wilful

and unauthorized interception or disclosure of such communications.

Another section allows immunity for testimony of witnesses

or production of records or other evidence in any case involving a vio-

lation of this chapter, or in violations enumerated in the chapter as those

in which court orders authorizing the interception of communications can

be issued. Thus, an immunity grant is available in proceedings relating

not only to violations of this Title but to any offense for which an eaves-

dropping order could be authorized. This covers a broad range of

offenses punishable under Title 18, U.S: Code, involving murder, robbery,

kidnapping and extortion, espionage, sabotage, etc.

Title IV, on "State Firearms Control Assistance, " which

does not become effective until 180 days after the date of enactment on

June 19, 1968, bases its principal provisions on the interstate commerce

clause and prohibits the sale or transfer of any firearm, other than a

shotgun or rifle, to any unauthorized person residing in another state.

Further, firearms dealers are prohibited from selling handguns to any

person less than 21 years of age and such dealers are required to keep

records of all sales which will include the name, age and place of resi-

dence of the person to whom such firearm is sold or delivered. Interstate

transportation of stolen firearms or firearms from which the serial

number has been removed is made unlawful. Any person who is under

indictment or who has been convicted of a crime punishable for a term

exceeding one year, or who is a fugitive from justice is prohibited from

shipping, transporting or receiving any firearm or ammunition in inter-

state or foreign commerce. The primary investigative jurisdiction is

to be vested in the Treasury Department. Upon the effective date of

Title IV, the Federal Firearms Act (Title 15, United States Code, Sections

901-910) will be repealed.

Until Title IV becomes effective, you will continue to

handle violation of the National Firearms Act and the Federal Firearms

Act as at present. Detailed instructions will be furnished you for com-

pliance with this Title prior to its effective date.

Title V provides that any person convicted in Federal,

State or local court of a felony pertaining to several specified types of

conduct in riots and civil disorders shall be disqualified, for five years

after conviction, from employment by the Federal Government or that of

the District of Columbia.

Title VI changes present law by providing that each sub-

sequent Director of the FBI shall be appointed by the President, by and

with the advice and consent of the Senate.

Title VII makes it unlawful for any person who (1) has

been convicted of a felony, or (2) has received a discharge from the

Armed Forces under other than honorable conditions, or (3) has been

adjudged a mental incompetent, or (4) has renounced his U. S. citizen-

ship, or (5) is an alien illegally or unlawfully in the United States, to

receive, possess or transport in commerce or affecting commerce any

firearm. It is also unlawful for an employee of any of the above, with

knowledge and in the course of his employment, to receive, possess or

transport in commerce or affecting commerce any firearm.

A "firearm" is any weapon (including a starter gun)

which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a

projectile by the action of an explosive; the frame or receiver of any

such weapon; or any firearm muffler or firearm silencer; or any

destructive device. Any handgun, rifle or shotgun is included in the

definition of a firearm. A "destructive device" is any explosive,

incendiary, or poison gas bomb, grenade, mine, rocket, missile, or

similar device; and inciudes any type of weapon which will or is designed

to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of any

explosive and having a barrel with a bore of one-half inch or more in

diameter.

Exempted from the above provisions are prisoners who,

by reason of duties connected with law enforcement, have been entrusted

with firearms by prison authorities, and persons who have received par-

dons and have been expressly authorized by the official granting the

pardon to receive, possess or transport firearms.

Penalty is a fine of not more than $10, 000 or imprison-

ment for not more than two years, or both.

Investigative jurisdiction was not designated. You will

be advised upon receipt of Department advice as to the Bureau's respon-

sibilities hereunder.

Title VIII allows the Federal Government to take an

appeal from an adverse ruling on a pretrial motion to suppress evi-

dence. This has not previously been possible except in narcotics

cases.

Title IX provides that a searen warrant may issue "to

search for and seize any property that constitutes evidence of a criminal

offense in violation of the laws of the United States." This makes a

fourth item for which the search warrant may issue, the others being the

instrumentalities, fruits and contraband of crime.

The statute here

follows the decision in Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S: 294 (1967), in

which the Supreme Court held that things purely evidentiary may be

searched for and seized.

Title X applies to the District of Columbia only. It

punishes threats or demands pertaining to kidnapping or to injuring

the person, property or reputation of another.

(C) FIRST LATIN AMERICAN CONGRESS OF JOURNALISTS -- Accord-

ing to current press reports, Fidel Castro is planning still another major

anti-U. S. propaganda spectacle scheduled to be known as the First Latin

American Congress of Journalists and planned for July 28, 1968, to

August 1, 1968, ir Havana. Reportedly, Latin American writers and

newsmen will form the nucleus of the Congress but press representatives

from Asia, Africa, Europe, and Nori, America also will be invited. Radio

Havana, one of the Cuban Government's chief propaganda outlets, has

announced the theme of the Congress as "Anti-imperialism," and delegates

are to be journalists who view the Congress as a powerful stimulus to the

revolutionary struggles in their home countries.

In keeping with the goals

outlined at the July, 1967, Latin American Solidarity Organization

Conference and the January, 1968, Cultural Congress, the forthcoming

meeting can logically be expected to close with the adoption of resolutions

exhorting the overthrow of the U. S. Government through violent, armed

revolutionary action.

It is anticipated that many U. S. apologists for the Gastro

regime will attend and that some legitimate U. S. newsmen will be aliowed

to cover open sessions of the Congress. Many will probably travel with-

out Department of State authority and under currant raonlatinns will not.

be subjected to punitive action by the U. S.

With respect to weigh-ins of male employees, existing regulations

require that the SAC or a designated supervisory official must personally observe

the weigh-ins and that internal record for detail and reference be preserved for

one year. To insure that adequate record exists by which responsibility can be

fixed for all such weight certifications, there must be recorded in this internal

record the identity of the supervisory official, or nurse where health service

provided, who physically observes the weigh-in of the employee. It is the

responsibility of each SAC to establish appropriate administrative devices to

insure that such certifying employee did, in fact, observe the weigh-in.

(B) ARRESTS - SEARCHES AND SEIZURES - STOP AND FRISK -- A decision

by the U. S. Supreme Court announced in Terry v. Ohio, on June 10, 1968,

established new precedent in the criminal law, hoiding that a law enforcement

officer investigating suspicious circumstances may search the outer clothing

of the suspect for weapons which might be used against him, even though

probable cause for arrest is lacking.

In that case a police officer stopped

three men on a downtown street after their behavior led him to conclude that

they were "casing a stick-up." He identified himself as an officer and asked

their names. The ofticer was not acquainted with any of the men nor had he

received any prior information concerning them. When the men "mumbled"

something in response to his inquiries, the officer patted down the outside of

Terry's clothing and felt a pistol in the left breast pocket of his overcoat. He

removed the gun and ordered all three suspects to face the wall. The officer then

patted down the outer clothing of the other twomen, and discovered a second weap-

on. Terry was convicted of carrying a concealed weapon and appealed to the

Supreme Court. On review, the Court affirmed the conviction, holding that if a

law enforcement officer, properly discharging a legitimate investigative function,

"reasonably concludes that criminal activity may be afoot and that the person with

whom he is dealing may be armed and dangerous," and if such suspicions are not

dispelled after he identifies himself and makes preliminary inquiries, he may

conduct a limited search of the outer clothing of such person for weapons which

might be used against him or others in the area. The standard of legality in

such circumstances is an objective one: would the facts available to the officer

at the moment of the search warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief

that the action taken was appropriate? The Court made clear throughout its

NW 55069 DocId: 32989528

Page

925

---

## Page 926

opinion that such protective measures may be undertaken even in situations

where there are insufficient grounds for arrest. But the officer must be able

to point to "specific and articulable facts" from which he reasonably inferred

that his safety was in danger.

The Chief Justice, writing for the majority, stressed that the

sole justification for such a search is self-protection; consequently, it must

be confined in scope to an intrusion reasonably designed to discover weapons

which might be used to assault the officer. Emphasis was placed on the fact

that the investigating officer in Terry first patted down the outer clothing of

the suspects and did not place his hands in their pockets or under the surface

of their outer garments until after he felt weapons. The Court did not decide

whether evidence other than weapons discovered in the course of the search

would be admissible.

• In two companion cases, the Supreme Court declined to pass

on the constitutionality of the New York "Stop and Frisk" Statute, holding that

the occasion did not warrant that determination. In Peters v. New York, an

off-duty policeman at home in his apartment heard strange noises at his door

which caused him to believe that someone was attempting to force entry. He

"collared" a suspicious-looking man tiptoeing down the corridor, frisked him

for weapons, and discovered an opaque plastic envelope containing burglar's

tools. The Supreme Court affirmed Peter's conviction without recourse to the

New York law, holding that when the officer "grabbed" the defendant he had

adequate cause for arrest and, while searching incident to that arrest for weap-

ons, lawfully discovered burglary tools.

In Sibron v. New York, the defendant was accosted by a police

officer in a restaurant, after being observed talking to several narcotics addicts,

and was told to come outside. Once outside the officer said to him, "You know

what I'm after." At that point, Sibron "mumbled something and reached into his

pocket." Simultaneously, the officer reached into the same pocket and removed

several glassine envelopes containing heroin. The Supreme Court reversed the

conviction, stating that "the mere act of talking to several narcotics suspects

over an eight-hour period no more gives rise to reasonable fear of life or limb

on the part of the officer than it justifies an arrest for committing a crime."

Furthermore, even assuming adequate grounds to search for weapons, the

scope of the search in this instance was clearly unrelated to that justification.

## Page 927

The Court concluded, therefore, that the officer was acting not to protect himself

but to look for evidence of narcotics.

The Terry opinion did not attempt to set forth detailed guidelines

governing the constitutional limits of an officer's authority in the "myriad

situations" in which the police and citizen confront each other on the street.

Chief Justice Warren stated, however, that whenever an officer "accosts an

individual and restrains his freedom to walk away," he has "seized!' that person

within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, consequently such conduct is sub~.

ject to constitutional regulation. The Court did not pass on the question of

whether a police officer may properly stop or "seize" a suspicious person upon

less than probable cause "for purpose of detention and/or interrogation." The

Chief Justice said it was unnecessary to reach that issue in Terry since it was

assumed that no restraint of liberty had occurred prior to the initial physical

contact for purposes of search. Thus the Court held only that, in appropriate

circumstances, a law enforcement officer may "seize" an individual for the

purpose of searching for weapons which might be used to assault him. The

opinion leaves unsettled the question of whether an officer may detain a suspicious

person momentarily for investigation —for example, while he checks the adjacent

area for evidence of criminal conduct, such as jimmy marks or other evidence

of tampering with a door front— or whether he can stop such person merely to

interrogate him regarding his suspicious or unusual behavior. Nor does the

opinion resolve whether, lacking grounds to arrest, a police officer may tempo-

rarily "seize" a person who closely fits the description of a fugitive for purposes

of ascertaining his true identity.

Justice Harlan filed a concurring opinion in Terry to "fill in a few

gaps " left by the majority. Harlan pointed out that "if the frisk is justified in

order to protect the officer during an encounter with a citizen, the officer must

first have constitutional grounds to insist on an encounter, to make a forcible

stop." He stated, therefore, that he "would make it perfectly clear that the

right to frisk in this case depends upon the reasonableness of a forcible stop to

investigate a suspected crime." Accordingly, the officer's "right to interrupt

Terry's freedom of movement and invade his privacy arose only because circum-

stances warranted forcing an encounter with Terry in an effort to prevent or

investigate a crime. Once that forced encounter was justified, however, the

officer's right to take suitable measures for his own safety followed automatically."

## Page 928

In addition, Justice White, also concurring in Terry, attempts

to clarify the matter of interrogation during an investigative stop, stating that

"given the proper circumstances, such as those in this case, it seems to me

the person may be briefly detained against his will while pertinent questions

are directed to him." "It is temporary detention," stated Justice White,

"which chiefly justifies the protective frisk for weapons." Consequently, if

there are sufficient grounds for an investigative stop, "constitutional rights

are not necessarily violated if pertinent questions are asked and the person is

restrained briefly in the process."

Until we have further clarification of these issues you should be

guided by the concurring opinions of Justices Harlan and White and of those

lower Federal courts which explicitly endorse the authority of law enforcement

officers to stop suspicious persons for the purposes of questioning and investi-

gation of crime and to frisk such persons for dangerous weapons when they

believe their safety so requires. This authority may be exercised in connection

with the investigation of known completed crimes, Arnold v. U. S., 382 F2d

4 (C.A. 9, 1967); of suspicious circumstances which suggest that a crime has

been or is being committed, U. S. v. Lewis, 362 F2d 759 (C.A. 2, 1966);

U. S. v. Thomas, 250 F. Supp. 771 (S.D.N. Y., 1966); Allen v. U. S., 390

F2d 476 (C.A. D.C., 1968); and, of persons resembling wanted fugitives when

the purpose of such detention is to ascertain the true identity of the individual,

Gilbert v. U. S., 366 F2d 923 (C.A. 9, 1966). See also, Wainwright v. City of

New Orleans, Louisiana,

U.S.

(June 17, 1968), concurring opinion by

Mr. Justice Fortas joined by Mr. Justice Marshall.

! It cannot be said with any certainty, at this point, whether an

investigative stop or "seizure" for the purpose of questioning will fall within the

rule of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), requiring that any inquiries

concerning the guilt of a detained suspect be prefaced with a warning and waiver

of his rights to silence and counsel. As a general rule, the state and lower

Federal courts have held that a routine inquiry into suspicious circumstances

on the street "does not produce the kind of custodial situation contemplated by

the Miranda doctrine"; consequently, neither a warning nor a waiver of Fifth or

Sixth Amendment rights is necessary. Allen v. U. S., 390 F2d 467, 479

(C,A.D.C., 1968); Brown v. U. S., 365 F2d 976, 979 (C.A. D. Co,

White v. U. S., 222 A. 2d 843 (1966); U. S. v. Davis, 259 F. Supp. 496 (D. Mass.

1967); U. S. V. Kuntz, 265 F. Supp. 543 (1965); Jones v. State, 234 A. 2d 900

(MdApp 1967); Morgan v. State, 234 A. 2d 762 (MdApp 1967). But the mere fact

that questioning occurs on the streets or in some other public place is not, in

itself, determinative of the issue. The application of Miranda safeguards will

depend, first, on whether there is any compulsion inherent in the surroundings

which might unfairly undermire the suspect's capacity to exercise his rights

and, secondly, on the purpose of the inquiry. If, for example, the suspect is

questioned in a coercive setting and such questioning is designed not merely to

sort out the facts or determine whether or not to arrest, but to deliberately

elicit a confession or admission of guilt from the suspect, a warning and waiver

of rights will be necessary.

The determination of whether the Agent has reason to believe that

he is dealing with an armed and dangerous individual must be drawn from the

total circumstances of each case. The fact that the suspect has been classified

"armed and dangerous" in a Bureau investigative report is not, in itself, sui-

ficient to warrant a search under the Terry rule. Such a classification, however,

should put the Agent on notice that the person with whom he is dealing is potentially

dangerous and that fact, together with other circumstances known to the investi-

gating Agent, may be sufficient to justify a self-protective search. These "other

circumstances" may be acquired from the investigative case file, from information

developed by the case Agent, from the very nature of the suspected offense, or

simply from the general demeanor of the suspect at the time of questioning. The

timeliness of such information is of particular relevance here since the Court

stressed that the officer must be justified in concluding that the suspect is armed

and presently dangerous. It should be understood, however, that these limitations

apply only to a self-protective search of persons for whom grounds to arrest are

lacking. The Terry case in no way restricts your right to take adequate safety

precautions during the apprehension of known Bureau fugitives.

Advise all investigative personnel.

(C) CLANDESTINE RADIO COMMUNICATIONS - POTENTIAL

OPERATORS - SECURITY MATTER - C -- Manual of Instructions,

Section 105L, sets forth instructions regarding the semiannual

(February 1 and August 1) submission of revisions and additions.

Previous submissions have indicated that there are some misunder-

standings in connection with the handling of this program.

An original FD-332 and six legible copies (dated February

1 or August 1 of the appropriate year) should be utilized in the sub-

mission of revisions, additions, and transfers. An addition to this

list is an individual who has not previously been on the list in any

office. The notation "ADDITION"' should not be made on this form

when an individual is transferred from one office to another.

Any revised portions of or additions to the FD-332 are to

be underlined.

In those instances where an individual is on the Security

Index, this information should appear only on the original FD-332,

together with the designated Priority level.

If there are no additions to or revisions of the Potential

Operators List, the Bureau may be advised by routing slip. It there

is a change in the Security Index status of an individual, the Bureau

should be advised by letter, and a revised FD-332 should not be submitted.

You are reminded that the deadlines in this matter should

be met.

Insure that in any case involving a transfer the receiving

office has been provided appropriate intormation in sufficient time

to meet the deadline.

An asterisk adjacent to the name of the office signifies that

it has a suggestion awaiting final resolution. It should be noted that the

Sacramento Office commenced operations on 9/25/67.

The overall number of suggestions received was 912 of

which 295 were adopted with three awaiting final action. There were nine

additional suggestions from previous fiscal years implemented during

Fiscal Year 1968 making the combined total of adoptions 304. Estimated

tangible first-year benefits amounted to over $113, 000 for which $4, 005

in incentive awards was granted. With the constant expansion of our

workload and the ever-increasing need for economy in our operations,

the value of good, sound ideas and suggestions for improvement cannot

be overemphasized. I earnestly enlist the continued cooperation and

support of all our personnel for this program.

(B) NATIONAL CRIME INFORMATION CENTER (NCIC) - TELETYPE

INQUIRIES -- An increased volume of teletype traffic from field offices

has been misdirected to the Bureau teletype room which has been meant

for inquiry to NCIC.

As set forth in prior SAC Letters, the latest being SAC Letter

67-47(A) dated 8/4/67, urgent inquiries to NCIC from field offices may

be made by teletype to NCIC, TWX Number 710-822-0006. You should

insure that all future teletype inquiries to NCIC are specifically so

designated by the dictating Agent. This will serve as a flag to the field

office teletype operator that such teletype is to be sent to TWX Number

710-822-0006.

These instructions are to be immediately made available to

all investigative personnel as well as the field office teletype operators.

(D) DESECRATION OF THE FLAG --On July 5, 1968, Public Law 90-381,

Desecration of the Flag, was signed by the President. It prohibits

contemptuous public mutilating, defacing, defiling, burning or trampling

on the flag of the United States or certain defined representations thereof.

This law is codified as Section 700 of Chapter 33, Title 18, U. S. Code.

Violators shall be fined not more than $1, 000 or imprisoned for not more

than one year, or both. The new classification for this violation is

designated as number 180. Character of investigative reports will be as

set out above.

The Department of Justice advised all states have laws pro-

hibiting desecration of the flag by acts similar to those forbidden by the

new statute. They also advised Congress made it clear it did not intend

the new statute to replace state laws covering desecration of the flag.

In order to strike a proper balance between state and Federal interests

in enforcing antiflag-burning statutes, the following procedures for in-

vestigation of possible violations were suggested by the Department of

Justice.

1. Upon receipt of information or a complaint from a person

or persons not known to be unreliable that a violation has occurred, a

preliminary investigation is to be promptly conducted. The preliminary

investigation will include a thorough interview with the complainant and

up to five other available witnesses who have personal knowledge of the

relevant facts concerning the violation.

2. Where a possible violation of state or local law is indicated,

contact is to be made with appropriate state or local authorities, who should

be advised of the information or complaint, offering these authorities

assistance on out-of-state leads and the full cooperation of the Laboratory

and Identification Divisions. In addition, ascertain what state or local

action has been taken or what action is contemplated.

3. If state or local authorities indicate an unwillingness or

inability to investigate and/or prosecute violators, full facts as to the

reasons for their inaction are to be obtained. Thereafter, this information.

is to be furnished to the appropriate United States Attorney and his opinion

is to be obtained as to what further investigation or other action, if any,

should be pursued. However, the Department has indicated no further action

shall be taken except by direction of the Criminal Division of the Depart-

ment of Justice.

The Department's suggested investigative guidelines should

be followed; however, if it is determined local authorities are aware of

and handling a violation and intend to prosecute, no investigation should

be instituted. The Bureau should be advised by appropriate communi-

cation, depending upon the urgency of the situation, of all complaints

received in this classification.

Two copies of investigative reports are to be furnished to the

Bureau so that dissemination can be made to the Department of Justice.

This information is to be promptly brought to the attention

of all personnel who will have an interest in this matter. Handbook and

manual changes will be forthcoming.

SAC LETTER 68-41

(E) DESERTERS -- By SAC Letter 64-38 dated July 28, 1964, you were

instructed to mark the appropriate block on the faceof a criminal finger-

print card, FD-249, when no identification record was needed in a

particular deserter case; further, that U. S. Marshals and local law

enforcement agencies should be told to do the same. These instructions

applied to fingerprints showing only "deserter" as the charge. The

block in question read "check if no reply is desired." It has since been

revised to provide two ballot boxes - one box to indicate that a record

is desired and the other box to indicate no record desired. In other words

a definite response, either yes or no, is now required.

A spot-check of current fingerprint submissions relating to

deserters showed very few contributors of such prints were marking the

face of the fingerprint card that no reply was desired. Accordingly,

foregoing instructions are being reiterated at this time. Additionally,

if contributor does not check either ballot box on deserter arrests we

will treat incoming print as not requiring an answer. This policy will

apply to deserters when no other offenses are involved and replies will

be sent in all cases if the subject is found to be wanted as the finger-

print card, Form FD-249, so states.

(F) OMNIBUS CRIME CONTROL AND SAFE STREETS ACT OF 1968;

IMMUNITY PROVISIONS - CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM --

A copy of the above act has been provided your office and the salient

provisions were outlined by SAC Letter 68-39 dated July 9, 1968. Title

• Ill of captioned law dealing with regulations for the control of electronic

surveillances contains an "Immunity of Witnesses" section. The Depart-

ment has furnished an interpretation that the provisions for immunity are

applicable in the offenses stipulated in this statute regardless of whether

an electronic surveiliance order has been issued in an investigation and

that the issuance or nonissuance of such an order is not a controlling

factor in the use of the immunity as prescribed by this statute.

This section allows immunity for testimony of witnesses or

production of records or other evidence in any offense for which an

electronic surveillance order could be authorized. This covers a broad

range of offenses punishable under Title 18, United States Code.

The importance of making full use of immunity, particularly

in organized crime cases involving the leadership level, has previously

been emphasized to you in connection with the then comparatively narrow

opportunity to apply its use in connection with provisions of Federal

narcotics laws and the Federal Communications Act. Despite its limited

application prior to the passage of the captioned bill, most significant

achievements were attained through the timely use of available immunity

grants. For example, lengthy incarceration of a midwestern La Cosa

Nostra 'boss" for contempt has completely neutralized him as an effective

and operational La Cosa Nostra chieftain. Similar results have been

obtained elsewhere.

Now, under the provisions of this new statute, our opportunity

to apply immunity grants in a wide range of Bureau violations should

greatly enhance our ability. to take direct action against the leadership

of organized crime. In that immunity grants are now available in all

offenses stipulated in this bill, this approach may now be used in all

offenses punishable under Title 18, United States Code, which involve

murder, robbery, kidnaping, extortion, and others, in addition to Inter-

state Transportation in Aid of Racketeering and its companion anti-

gambling statutes including Sports Bribery: Extortionate Credit Transactions;

Theft From Interstate Shipment: Interstate Transportation of Stolen

## Page 937

Property; embezzlement from pension and welfare funds; bribery; and

others. From this it can be seen that greatly increased use of this valuable

tool in prosecutions is now possible.

You should insure all Agents are thoroughly familiar with

these immunity provisions and that these provisions receive full consideration

in your investigations of organized crime, racketeering and other criminal

violations specified in this statute.

7/23/68

SAC LETTER 68-41

(G) AIRCRAFT PIRACY - CRIME ABOARD AIRCRAFT MATTERS --

During recent weeks there has been a decided increase in commercial

airline hijackings as well as other offenses associated with air travel.

Usually the armed hijacker gains access to the plane cockpit by threatening

a stewardess, crewman, or passenger. After establishing control of the

pilot the hijacker then orders a course change for Cuba.

In a recent instance the aircraft made a fuel stop en route

while the hijacker, successfully holding authorities at bay while the fueling

took place, threatened to destroy the plane and its occupants by detonating

a hand grenade.

As you are aware, Section 1472, Title 49 (Crime Aboard Air-

craft Statute), provides penalties for aircraft piracy and the commission

of other offenses aboard aircraft. In addition, this statute specifically

charges the f'bi With investigative jurisdiction. Accordingly, it is

imperative that every measure be taken to insure possible violations of

this statute are promptly reported to our field offices and that immediate

intensive investigative action be taken in each instance.

'In order to insure that your liaison with various air carriers,

airport terminals, and local representatives of the Federal Aviation

Administration is completely effective and to insure each is aware of FBI

responsibilities and the necessity for prompt referral, each field division

should adhere to the following:

7/23/68

SAC LETTER 68-41

- 7-

NW 55069

DocId: 32989528 Page 937

## Page 938

1. Those field divisions covering national headquarters

for commercial air carriers will contact ranking officials in

order to review FBI jurisdictional responsibilities. In addition,

discussions should be had with these officials as to how each

airline can be of assistance to the FBI with respect to these

violations. Airlines should be encouraged to initiate educational

programs among their employees stressing the importance

of being alert to irrational, emotionally unstable passengers,

thereby possibly avoiding a hijacking or other offenses. Air-

lines should be urged to require their employees to record

as complete identifying data as possible with respect to air-

line passengers. Likewise, methods should be developed to

establish effective communication between airline represent-

atives throughout the country, their national headquarters,

and the FBI so that emergencies can be dealt with without

delay.

2. Similar contact should be made with major airline

terminal personnel, discussing FBI investigative responsi-

bilities under the law and establishing the liaison that is

necessary to cope with incidents such as hijackings and other

major crimes involving aircraft with a minimum of delay

and confusion. Insofar as possible emergency plans should

be considered in the event such situations develop.

3. Full and detailed discussions should be had with

local representatives of the Federal Aviation Administration

as well as local police authorities.

4. Emergency plans should be established in each

field division so that should a major offense affecting air-

lines take place adequate investigative and supervisory

personnel are on the scene immediately. It is imperative

that such situations be properly controlled by the FBI and

not allowed to get out of hand. It is necessary you recognize

that in order to effectively handle such major offenses often-

times involving distraught and emotional passengers, harassed

air carriers, interested news media and mentally disturbed

subjects, sufficient manpower must be utilized in the most

effective and efficient manner.

You are reminded of the fact that matters relating

to air safety and operations are the responsibility of the air

carrier and the Federal Aviation Administration - not the

FBI. Accordingly, a decision such as the unscheduled

grounding of an aircraft is one to be made by those authorities.

5. Inasmuch as the vast majority of aircraft hijackings

experienced thus far has resulted in the subject's seeking

asylum in Cuba with the aircraft and passengers returned

to the United States within 24 hours, each field division

should be alert in its interrogation of the returning passengers

and crew to any information of an intelligence nature or

bearing upon our national security. Specific inquiry should

be made as to any interrogation conducted by Cuban authorities.

You should determine whether the passengers were searched

or photographed.

A booklet, "Airlines and the FBI," is being prepared for

immediate distribution to the field. It outlines FBI jurisdiction and sug:

gests methods whereby air carriers and their employees can effectively.

assist in the enforcement of Federal laws concerning offenses involving

air travel. You should withhold liaison contacts as set forth above until

the receipt of these pamphlets in your respective field divisions in order

that they may be effectively utilized and distributed in connection with

these discussions. No mention should be made at this time concerning

the preparation of such a pamphlet.

Each office should advise the Bureau by letter results of its

liaison contacts no later than August 12, 1968..

(H) INVESTIGATION OF THÉ NEW LEFT - There has been a marked

increase in recent months of bombings and burnings of public buildings

and other acts of terrorism which could logically have been perpetrated

by extremist elements of the New Left. New Left leaders have constantly

exhorted their followers to abandon their traditional role of "passive

dissent' and resort to acts of violence and terrorism as a means of

disrupting the defense effort and opposing established authority. Publi-

cations of the New Left are replete with articles proposing the bombings

of draft boards and other Government installations, and literature con-

taining detailed diagrams and instructions for making incendiary devices

has been widely disseminated among New Left groups.

I have been appalled by the reaction of some of our field offices

to some of the acts of violence and terrorism which have occurred, such

as

those which have recently taken place in certain college towns and in

some instances on college campuses. While it is recognized that many

of these acts do not constitute violations of law within the primary

investigative jurisdiction of the Bureau, it is essential, where the strong

presumption exists that acts of violence have been perpetrated by New

Leftists or other subversive elements under investigation by the Bureau,

that every logical effort should be made to resolve through contact with

established sources whether these elements are in fact responsible for

such acts. Of course, good judgment and extreme caution must be

utilized in this connection so as not to convey the impression to the

public or other investigative agencies that we are assuming jurisdiction

in those instances where there are not facts which would establish FBI

jurisdiction.

It cannot be too strongly emphasized that positive results can

be achieved only through the development of adequate high quality informants

who are in a position to obtain detailed information regarding the activities

and future plans of individuals and organizations affiliated with the New

Left movement.

When terroristic acts occur which by reason of the target

of the act or by reason of the locale would appear to fit into the objectives

of or could have been motivated by subversive elements, particularly

New Leftists, I expect an immediate and aggressive response from you

in the form of alerting and directing all logical sources and informants

into activity to determine if subversive groups could have been responsible.

I have reminded you time and again that the militancy of the

New Left is escalating daily. Unless you recognize this and move in a

more positive manner to identify subversive elements responsible so

that appropriate prosecutive action, whether federally or locally

initiated, can be taken, this type of activity can be expected to mount

in intensity and to spread to college campuses across the country. This

must not be allowed to happen and I am going to hold each Special Agent

in Charge personally responsible to insure that the Bureau's responsi-

bilities in this area are completely met and fulfilled.

(A) WORK-RELATED INJURIES (FIELD) - FISCAL YEAR 1968 --

Enclosed is an injury report for fiscal year 1968. It demonstrates by

statistical comparison with fiscal year 1967 the number of accidents

resulting in injuries for each office, the types of accidents causing the

injuries and the injury rate. The injury rate for the entire FBI this

year was the same as last year (2.8%). All offices should continue to

make every effort to avoid accidents. Automobile accidents, handling

materials and falls were the major contributing reasons for a good

portion of injuries this year. Five offices reported no work-related

injuries which is commendable and should be the ultimate goal of other

offices. Make certain you continue to emphasize safety precautions in

respect to physical condition and maintenance of your space and equip-

ment and instill a safety-conscious attitude among your staffs.

•(C) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- Recently two Bureau

fugitives, one of whom was in the process of being placed on the Ten Most

Wanted Fugitives List, were located and apprehended by Bureau Agents

on the basis of information furnished by racial informants.

In recent months, racial informants have furnished information

which resulted in the conviction of seven subjects for conspiracy to vio-

late the Federal Bank Robbery Statutes; the solution of a bank robbery

two hours after it took place; the arrest by local authorities of two

individuals on charges of arson; and the arrest of one and the killing of

another Klan official while attempting to bomb a private residence.

The above are some of the examples which point out the

latent potential our racial informants have for utilization in the solving

of criminal cases. The very nature of the activities of some extremist

racial organizations involves them in the commission of criminal acts

for the purpose of obtaining funds to finance the organization in question.

Racial informants in these organizations are often knowledgeable of

criminal matters and are in positions to report on matters of a criminal

nature.

You should constantly be alert to opportunities to utilize the

services of racial informants where they can be of assistance to your

office in criminal matters. Where racial informants are logically in

contact with criminal elements, you should insure that Identification

Orders, Wanted Flyers and photographs of bank robbery suspects are

shown to these informants.

Consideration should be given to reviewing unsolved criminal

cases in your office with the end in mind of making contact with racial

informants who have not been questioned in the past concerning the

unsolved cases and are now in logical positions to assist you in the

solving of these cases.

(D) MINUTEMEN -- A review of communications received pursuant to

SAC Letter 68-38 (C) indicates that there is insufficient informant cover-

age of captioned organization. This must be changed immediately and.

adequate informant coverage developed in each area having any Minutemen

organization.

The necessity for adequate informant coveragehas been demonstrated

in the recent past by the convictions of Minutemen on charges of Bank

Robbery - Conspiracy in the Seattle, Washington, area and the arrests

of Minutemen by the Connecticut State Police as members of the Minute-

men were commencing a raid on a pacifist camp. Both were based on

information furnished by Bureau informants and demonstrate what can be

achieved when adequate informant coverage is available.

As each office is aware, Robert Bolivar DePugh, Minutemen

leader, is in a fugitive status as a result of his indictment on Bank Robbery -

Conspiracy charges at Seattle, Washington. DeFugh, in a letter dated

June 15, 1968, urged members to continue their activity and to recruit

new members.

•Individuals who have become inactive are to be contacted

and encouraged to renew their participation.

This recruiting drive presents a perfect opportunity for each office

to get on the offensive in the development of informants in the Minutemen.

A minimum of one member informant should be developed in every known

Minutemen group.

Many Special Agents in Charge have replied that there is no known

Minutemen organization in their territories. Such a statement is question-

able when groups have previously existed, and there is no actual coverage

to establish the current situation beyond a reasonable doubt. No office

should feel that it is aware of the existence of the Minutemen within its

territory when there is no member informant or source in a position to

know.

No office should rely totally on outside sources for information.

Although many police organizations on state and local levels have developed

informant coverage in the Minutemen, only through the development and

handling of Bureau informants can we be sure that all pertinent information

is being received. We must, nevertheless, insure that all police depart-

ments are keenly aware of our deep interest in this organization so that

each department will furnish available information to supplement the

information developed through Bureau informants.

The coming months present an excellent opportunity for informant

development. Adequate coverage must be developed so that the Bureau

will be in a position to fulfill its responsibilities in the event the Minute-

men plan to carry out acts of violence. We must have prior knowledge

of all such plans so that we will be in a position to act and not merely

react after some incident has occurred.

Each Special Agent in Charge will be held personally accountable

for the development of adequate informant coverage in the Minutemen.

Within 60 days, each office advise the Bureau of progress made in the

development of adequate informant coverage. À complete reevaluation

of Minutemen activities should be included.

Plans that have been

formulated to obtain adequate coverage where necessary should also

be furnished the Bureau, as well as the steps being taken to carry out

these plans.

(E) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- Effective immediately,

the maximum permissible period between contacts with established ghetto-

type racial informants is extended from two weeks to one month. Prior

to the time that you consider an individual as an established ghetto-type

informant, you must continue to make contacts with that individual at

least once every two weeks. A ghetto-type racial informant is to be

considered established only after he has been contacted a sufficient

number of times (1) to insure that good rapport exists between the con-

tacting Special Agent and the individual concerned, (2) to insure that the

individual concerned is fully aware of the nature and seriousness of the

matters assigned to him, and (3) to establish adequate channels of com-

munication suitable for use at any time. To definitely fix the time at

which a ghetto-type racial informant is considered established, the

Special Agent handling the informant must place a memorandum in

informant's file stating that requirements (1), (2), and (3), mentioned

above, have been met.

by Fidel Castro, Prime Minister of Cuba, until its dissolution

in 1962.

A second source advised that the CCC, originally

founded as a social club of New York area residents of

Cuban extraction, was sympathetic to Castro during his

struggle for power. Subsequent to January 1, 1959, as it

became apparent that communism was the form of government

in Cuba, the leaders of the 26th of July Movement assumed

control. of CCC and its membership declined.

The first source above advised that Casa de las

Americas is also ostensibly formed as a social club, but in

effect it acts as a focal point for revolutionary peoples

sympathetic to the Cuban Government.

Although it is not

directly controlled by the Cuban Mission to the United Nations

(CMUN), many Cuban personnel attend its functions and at

least an indirect link with CHUN is present.

Casa de las

Americas has fund-raising affairs and contributes money to the

CMUN.

Casa de las Americas also gives financial support to

other revolutionary groups representing countries other than

Cuba.

Through ChUN, various propaganda materials of a

communist nature are found at Casa de las Americas.

This

same source also stated that some executive committee members,

• as well as general members of Casa de las Americas, are members

of the Spanish Section of the Communist Party, United States

of America (CPUSA) .

An indirect link does occur at Casa de

las Americas in that it is used as a staging ground prior

to entry into CPUSA.

Further, source indicates that

membership in Casa de las Americas serves as

an excellent

background for persons desiring to return to Cuba.

This same source stated that, although there

exists in Cuba, a social club called Casa de las Americas

supported by the Cuban Government, there appears to be no

connection between the two and no

reason to believe that

the Casa de las Americas in New York was named after the

one in Cuba.

At this meeting the sembers of the Bogalusa,

the

state organization eitective Sentesber 1, 1957, and to

continue to operate as an independent Klan group.

The reason

for concluding this association nith the state organization

was that meabers of the Bogalusa unit had become very

unhappy in regard to sending nonthly dues to the state

organization in Hississippi and never getting anything in

reture.

As at as the Bogalusa members were concerned,

this was a waste of money.

The members voted to refer to themselves and their

unit as the White Kaights of the Ku Klux Klan with the aims

and purposes continuing to be to pronote and maintain white

supremacy and the segregation of the races.

This Klan group is not chartered under the laws

of the state of Louisiana and is also attenpting to become

CHARACTERIZATION OF SUBVERSIVE, RACIAL, KLAN,

WHITE HATE, AND MILITANT BLACK ORGANIZATIONS

Tim Wohlforth, when a member of the Socialist Workers

Party (SWP) National Committee, led a minority group of ten

accusing

the majority group of

losing revolutionary perspective.

The Wohlforth group adhered to the views of British Trotskyists,

with whom it secretly consorted, and with certain co-thinkers

in the International Committee of the Fourtb International (FI);

a world Trotskyist organization. It accused the leadership of

adopting views of those within the FI who favored "bureaucratic"

revolution over the genuine "revolutionary working class outlook"

of Leon Trotsky.

Domestically, the Wolforth faction opposed

SWP orientation toward student activity, feeling the Party should

place major emphasis on trade unions and participation in the

civil rights struggle.

Although tolerated for some time, the Wolforth group

was expelled from the SWP in July, 1964.

Following expulsion, the Wohlforth group formed the

• American Committee for the Fourth International and planned to

work with other radical and militant organizations, conveniraiiug

on the civil rights movement, which to them is a basic "class"

struggle.

More recently, the group has devoted time and effort

to its call for an American labor party, which in its view will

enable the working class to exert its latent political power.

It plans to build a political party around a publication and

classes of instruction in Marxism.

During November, 1966, the organization's name was

changed to Workers League.

Headquarters is 243 East 10th Street,

New York, New York. Its publication is the "Bulletin" (Bulletin

of International Socialism).

The SHP has been designated pursuant to Executive

Order 10450.

WORKERS WORLD PARTY

On April 17, 1959, a confidential source advised

a Socialist Workers Party (SWP)

minority group under

that on February 12, the leadership Of National Conmittee

member Sam Ballan, split from the SWP.

The source stated that this minority group, referred

to as the Marcyites, after many years of program and policy

differences on varied issues concerning tactics and interpreta-

tion o1 political events, split from the swip on the grounds

that the Party was liquidating itself by departing from the

Marxist precepts of Leon Trotsky and retreating

from the light

the world socialist revolution.

The final issue which

ultimately forced the split was the minority's opposition to

the SVP regroupment policy which involved cooperation with

the Communist Party (CP) periphery-individuals characterized

by the minority as petty-bourgeois.

The minority program, according to the source,

advocated unconditional defense of the Soviet Union and has as its

goal the building of a revolutionary party with a complete

proletarian orientation for the purpose of overthrowing

capitalism in the United States and throughout the world.

On May 12, 1960,

source advised that this minority

group had chosen the name Workers World Party.

On May 1, 1968, a second confidential source advised

that the Workers World Party, which maintains headquarters at

46 West 21st Street, New York, New York, supports the People's

Republic of China in its ideological dispute with the Soviet

Union.

The SWP and the CP have been designated pursuant to

Executive Order 10450.

WORLD FELLOWSHIP, INC. (WFI), also known as

World Fellowship Center

The records of the Office of the Secretary of State

of Illinois, show that World Fellowship, Inc. (WFI) submitted

Articles of Incorporation on

October 13, 1936. The Annual

Report of NFI, dated March 5, 1959, lists Willard Uphaus as

Executive Director, Secretary and Acting Treasurer, 66 Edgewood

Avenue, New Haven,

Connecticut. The character of the affairs

which the corporation is actually conducting is listed as

"Occasional publications,

summer conferences at World FellOy-

ship Center in New Hampshire, Executive Director travels to

speak and organize activities for justice and peace."

On July 24, 1963, a source described World Fellow-

ship Center, Albany, New Hampshire, as definitely procommunist

in attitudes

and objectives, based

on their programs and

speakers of known communist

and communist front backgrounds

appearing

there, which programs and speakers have been critical

of the United States Government and its policies as opposed to

praiseworthy pronouncements of the concepts of governments in

the Soviet Union and its allies, notably China.

Willard Uphaus was sentenced to one year imprisonment

for contempt of court on December 14, 1959, in Merrimack County

Superior Court, New Hampshire, for refusal

to produce records

identifying individuals who attended the World

Fellowship

Center, Conway, New Hampshire, during 1954 and 1955. The

New Hampshire Attorney General said many of these individuals

were affiliated with groups "officially designated as communist

intiltrated or controlled,"

'and requested their identities in

connection with an investigation of subversive activities in

the State of New Hampshire. Uphaus was released from Merrimack

County House of Correction, Boscawen, New Hampshire, on

December 11, 1960.

A second source advised on March 28, 1960, that

plans had been announced

for a building program for WFI summer

camp which would represent a monument to the sacrifice

Willard Uphaus

has made in connection with his work for WFI,

and his struggle with the courts resulting in this imprison-

ment.

According to this source, contributions were being

solicited to the World Fellowship Building Fund for this

purpose with a goal in Connecticut of $85,000.

class struggle principles,

and that the supporters of the Is have come into basic poliiival

solidarity with the SHP on the principles of revolutionary

socialism.

On March 10, 1967, a source advised that the YSA was

formed during 1957, by youth of various left socialist tenden-

cies, particularly

members and followers of the SWP. The

source further advised that the YSA has recently become more

(B) OMNIBUS CRIME CONTROL AND SAFE STREETS ACT OF 1968 -

PUBLIC LAW 90-351 -- The Department of Justice has recently

advised as follows: "Agents of the FBI should continue to coordinate

their activities as closely as possible with State and local law

enforcement officers." The Department added that, "So long as

information obtained by electronic surveillance by State or.local

officers has been obtained in accord with the relevant State statute,

with Title III of the Safe Streets Act, and with other applicable

requirements of the Constitution, the information may legitimately be

used by Federal agents in the course of their investigative activities. "

The Department also pointed out that Agents "should take reasonable

measures to insure that their operations are based on information

lawfully obtained, so that Federal prosecutions will not be tainted by

illegal evidence. " In this connection, Title III of the Omnibus Crime

Control and Safe Streets Act sets strict requirements for the use of

electronic surveillances by state or local law enforcement officers

acting under court order, including a requirement that the surveillance

must be carried out under a state statute enacted in compliance with

the specific standards set by Title III.

Henceforth, substantive Bureau cases stemming from state

or local investigations which include the use of a court-approved

electronic surveillance can be investigated by the field when such court

approval is soundly based on the provisions of Title IlI of captioned

act. In this regard such cases should first be discussed with the

appropriate United States Attorney for a determination as to the legality

of the court approval under Title II, and the Bureau must be furnished

an appropriate UACB communication including or immediately followed

by a letterhead memorandum containing a summary of facts, the

specific statutes under which the electronic device in question was

authorized, the identity of the judge issuing the court order, date of

issuance, the opinion of the United States Attorney and action to be

taken. The same procedure should be followed in instances where

Agents are invited to participate as observers in state or local raids

of potential mutual interest when such raids stem from preliminary

investigation which included the use of an electronic surveillance.

and amends Section 2, Chapter 83 of Title 18, United States Code,

adding Section 1716A entitled, "Nonmailable motor vehicle master

keys." This law prohibits the mailing or causing to be mailed of any

motor vehicle master key, any pattern, impression, or mold. It also

prohibits the mailing of advertisements for the sale of such keys. This

law prohibits only mailing offenses and does not pertain to otherwise

• interstate transportation of master keys.

The unauthorized mailing of motor vehicle master keys is

a Postal violation. In the event a violation of this law is discovered

during one of our investigations, the matter should be promptly referred

to the nearest Postal Inspector's Office.

Insure this is brought to the attention of all investigative

personnel.

(D) INVESTIGATION OF KLAN, WHITE HATE AND BLACK

NATIONALIST GROUPS - With the tense racial situation in the

United States at this time, it becomes increasingly important that we

are fully aware of the full text of speeches made by leaders of both

black and white extremist groups at meetings and rallies. Many of

the leaders of such groups, such as the Ku Klux Klan and the Black

Panthers, travel extensively to make these speeches and during same,

utter highly inflammatory statements. It is imperative that the

communications furnished the Bureau concerning these meetings and

rallies contain a comprehensive summary of the remarks made by the

speakers, under the appropriate caption.

The Bureau has a responsibility to know and be able to

advise appropriate officials of the plans, statements and threats of

such agitators, as well as to develop information which could lead to

possible future Federal prosecution.

As you have been previously instructed and in your

continuing coverage of these assemblages, you should, where

appropriate, utilize security and racial informants, panel sources,

ghetto informants and other contacts to obtain the text of these

speeches. This is to insure that there will be individuals available

who may be in a position to testify at a later date.

operations. An assignment given recently to one of our double agents

by his principal, an official of the Cuban Mission to the. United Nations,

confirmed that the FBI continues to be a major target of Cuban intel-

ligence operations in the U. S.

The double agent was instructed to develop information con-

cerning personnel of the FBI and the Central Intelligence Agency. He

was told to obtain names, home addresses, telephone numbers, physical

descriptions, hobbies, likes and dislikes of such personnel, as well as

complete descriptions of automobiles they operate. The double agent

was also instructed to develop information concerning the manner in

which the FBI recruits refugees for infiltration of Cuban organizations.

Assure that appropriate personnel are aware of the Cuban

Government's current interest in FBI personnel, methods, and equipment

and that they comply with instructions in SAC Letters 60-6 (B) and

(C) CHARACTERIZATION OF SUBVERSIVE, RACIAL, KLAN, WHITE

HATE, AND MILITANT BLACK ORGANIZATIONS - INTERNAL SECURITY -

COMMUNIST - - Set forth below is an up-to-date characterization of the

Black Panther Party which has its headquarters in Berkeley, California,

and branches in a number of cities throughout the United States.

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther Party

(BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to

organize black people so they can take control of the life, politics, and the

destiny of the black community. It was organized by Bobby George Seale,

• BPP Chairman, and Huey P. Newton, BPP Minister of Defense. Newton

is presently serving a sentence of 2 to 15 years on a conviction of man-

slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further

describes itself as the "Biack Community News Service," states that the

BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary

program to end oppression of the black people. Residents of the black

community are urged to arm themselves against the police who are con-

sistently referred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September. 7, 1968, contains an

editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray, which

ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping

is a revolutionary culture. Change.

Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!

Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing in the

October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the statement, "

we will not dissent from American Government. We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations

from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the People's Republic

of China and feature MAO's statement that "political power grows out of

the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck

Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been established at

various locations throughout the United States.
