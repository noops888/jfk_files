THE CUBA PROJECT

1. OBJECTIVE

The U.S. objective is to help the Cubans overthrow the Communist

regire from within Cuba and institute a new government with which the

United States can live in peace:

II. CONCEPT OF OPERATION

Basically, the operation is to bring about the revolt of the Cuban

people. The revolt will overthrow the Communist regime and institute

a new government with which the United States can live in peace.

The revolt requires a strongly motivated political action movement

established within Cubz, to generate the revolt, to give i: direction to-

wards the objective, and to capitalize on the climactic moment. The

political actions will be assisted by economic warfare to induce failure

of the Communist regime to supply Cuba's economic needs, psychological

operations to turn the peoples' resentment increasingly against the regime.

and milita-y-type groups to give the popular movement an action arm lor

sabotage and armed resistance in support of political objectives.

release or declassification of this document in full

Reviewed on _

The failure. of the U.S. -sponsored operation in April 1961 60 shook

• the faith of Cuban patriots in U.S. competence and intentions in support-

ing a revolt against Castro that a new effort to generate a revolt against

the regime in Cuba must have active support from key Latin American

countries. Further, the foreigness (Soviet Union and Bloc) of the tyranay

imposed on the Cuban people must be made clear to the people of the

Western Hernisphere to the point of their deep anger and open actiors to

defend the Western Hemisphere against such foreigs invasion, Such an

anger will be generated, in part, by appeals frora the popular movement

within Cuba to other Latin Americans especialiy.

The preparation phase must result in a political action organization

in being in key localities inside Cuba, with its own means for internal

communications, its own voice for psychological operations, and its own

action arm (small guerrilla bands, sabotage squads, etc.). It must bave

the sympathetic support of the majority of the cuban people, and make tris

fact known to the outside world. (It is reported that the majority of Cubans

are not for the present regime, but are growing apathetic towaids what

appears to be a hopeless iuture or the futility of their ftarus.)

The climactic moment of revolt will come from an angry reaction of

the people to a government action (sparked by an incident), or from a

fracturing of the leadership cadre within the regime, or both. (A major

goal of lhe Project must be to bring this abou:.) The popular movement

will capitalize on this climactic moment by initiating an open revolt.

Areas will be taken and held. Il necessary, the popular moverent will

appeal for help io the free nations of the Western Hemisphere. The

United States, if possible in concert with other Western Hemisphere

nations, will then give open support to the Cuban peoples' revolt. Such

support will include military force, as necessary.

1D. ESTIMATE OF THE SITUATION

• Our planning requires sound intelligence estimates of the situation

re Cuba. The latest National Estimate (SNIE 85-61) of 28 November

1961 contains operational conclusions not based on hard fact, in addition

to its intelligence conclusions; this is a repetition of an error in the

planning for the unsuccessful operation of last April.

The planning indicated herein will be revised, as necessary, based

on the hárd intelligence estimate of the situation by the U.S. Intelligence

community. A new National Intelligence Estimate (NIE 85-62 on Cuba),

due on 23 January, apparently has been postponed until 7 February.

It is recognized that one result of the Project, so far, has been to

start the collection of Intelligence on Cuba in depth, to provide facts on

which to base firm estimates and operations.

IV. INITIAL PHASE

(30 Nov 61 - 18 Jan 62)

A. Establish a U.S. mechanism for the project.

Statug: The President's directive of 30 November 1961 was imple-

mented by creating a U.S. operations team, with Brig. Gen. Lansdale

as Chief of Operations, and with tasks promptly assigned. His immedi

ate staff are Mr. Hand and Major Patchell. Representatives of Secre-

taries and Agency Directors are:

State

- Woodward (Goodwin, Hurwitch)

CIA - Helma

Defense - Brig. Gen. Craig

USIA - Wilson

.B. Intelligence Support

Status: CLA made a special survey of U.S. Capabilities to interrogate

Cuban refugees in the USA (1, 700 - 2,000 arriving per month) and on

- 16 January approved a program increasing the staff at the Opa Locka

Interrogation Center

in Florida from the present 2 people to 34. CIA will

build up agent assets (positive intelligence assets inside Cuba are very

limited and it has no counter-intelligence assets inside). Special intelli-

gence assets will be exploited more fuily. The Cuba project needs far

more hard intelligence in depth than is presently available. ClA will

require further assistance from Defense and other U.S. organizations

in this intelligence effort, and is submitting specific qualifications for

personnel on 19 January:

C. Political platform for peoples' movement inside Cuba.

Status: State has sketched in a broad outline. CLA is to produce

the firm platform statement of aims for whick the Cubans who will

operate inside Cuba are willing to risk their lives, and upon which

popular support can be generated.

D. Nucleus for popular movement

Status: To date, CLA has been unable to produce the secessary

political action agents for this purpose. Upon re-evaluation of its

capabilities, CLA now hopes to complete spotting and assessing eight

to ten Cuban political action agents by IS February, from among

Cubans available in the United States. The minimum need for the

Project to be effective is 30 such political action Cubans and CiA is

tasked to make a priority search for them among Cubans in the U.S.

and Caribbean area.

E. Deployment of nucleus

Status: CLA is tasked to select 20 localities within Cuba wore

political action groups can be establisbed. " Initial selection and plans

for establishing these action groups are now due l February. Havana,

and localities in the provinces of Camaguey and Las Villas will receive

priority consideration, according to present intelligence. Planning on

this must be adjusted as firmer intelligence is acquied.

F. Diplomatic actions

Status: State is concentrating on the OAS Mesting of Foreign

Ministers, which opens 22 January, boping to get wide Western Hemis-

phere support for OAS resolutions condemning Cuba and isolating it

from the rest of the Hemisphere. A compasion resolution, to offer

OAS relief directly to the suffering Cuban people (similar to U.S.

relief to Russia, 1919-20) is being considered, as a means to reach

tbe Cuban people sympatbetically w

thout going through their com

munist government. The OAS me

ig is to be supported by publis

demonstrations in Latin Americal

logical campaign assisted by USLA

Alfrared by CIA, and a psycho-

The major task for our diplomatic capability is to encourage Latin

American leaders to develop independent operations similar to this Pro-

ject, seeking an internal revolt of the Cuban people against the Communist

regime. This is yet to be initiated by State and musi be vigorously pressed.

1,2,45

G. Economic warfare

Status: This critical key to our political action Project is still in the

planning slage under State leadership. State is basing future economic

actions, including plans for an embargo on Cuban trade, on the outcome

of the forthcoming OAS meeting. Meanwhile, State has chaired an Economic

action group, which agreed on developing 13 actions. 15 February is ser for

report on implementing plans, so that actions can be initialed?

ments to Cuba are carried in Western bottoms), CIA has initiated

action to contaminate POL supplies for Cuba, afthough visible results

(stoppage of some Cuban transport) is not expected until mid-1962.

J. Military actions

Status: Defense has been tasked with preparing a contingency plan

for U.S. military action, in case the Cuban people request U.S. help

when their revolt starts making headway. This contingency plan will

permit obtaining a policy decision on the major point of U.S. intentions,

and is looked upon as a positave political-psychological factor in a

people's revolt, even more than as a possible military action. Defense

also has been tasked with fully assisting State and CIA, as commitments

of Defense men, money, and materiel are required.

K. Major elements of the population

Status: Both State and CIA are continuing to explore their capabilities

(with results largely negative to date) for mounting special group operations

inside Cuba focused upon dynamic elements of the population,

CIA

1.3(ª(4)

This is vital to the success of our political action nucleus when ClA can

pyt it into place.

1. Outlook

Status: As reported to the Special Group last week, there has been a

period of a realistic second look at CLA capabilities to mouni the required

. _ clandestine operations against Cuba, and a subsequent start in "tooling up."

After this second look, CIA has concluded that its realistic role should be

to create at least the illugion of a popular movement, to vin external support

for it, to improve CLA operational capability, and to help create a climate

which will permit provocative actions in support of a shilt to overt action:

This ouflook, although arrived at thoughtfully within CIA, is far short of

¿be Cuba project's goals. CLA must take yet another hard look al ita

potential capabilitics, in the light of the following rasking, to determine

il it cannot make the greater effort required.

Cubans enlisted in the U.Se armed forces.

Due 28 February.

VI. FUTURE PLANS

By 20 February, it is expected that sufficient realistic plans for

individual tasks will have been received, and initial actions started, to

permit a firm time-table to be constructed. Since the President directed

that the Chief of Operations conduct the Project through the appropriate

organizations and Departments of the Government, and since these U.S.

organizations are mainly in the initial inventory and development of

capabilities phase concerning assigned tasks, a precise operations time -

table as óf today would be too speculative to be useful.

An has alerted Defense that it will require considerable military

recluding two submarines, PT boats, Coast Guard type cutters,

Special

sides trainers, C-54 aircraft, F-86 aircraft, amphibian air-

¡craft, belio-couriers, Army leafet battalion, and Guantanamo as a base

for submarine operations

SAlso, CLA apparently believes that its role

should be to create and aspand a popular moverent, illusory and actual,

which will create a political climate which can provide a framework of

plausible excuse for armed intervention. This is not in conformity with

the Presidential directive now governing Projecttasking- Actually, the

role of creating the polítical climate and plausible excuse for armed

intervention would be more prope

ly that of State and Defense, if such

an objective becomes desirable.
