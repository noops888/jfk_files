JOHN HOWARD LAWSON

848 ELYRIA DRIVE

LOS ANGELES, CALIF, 9O065'

March 12, 1967.

Dear Gertrude:

It seems that we allow much too much

time to pass between letters. By the time I' get around

to writing you and Stefan, & find I have

forgotten

of the things I wanted to say, and regret that I

have not made notes of them from one moment to another.

We spent a day down at laguna Hills with

Herb and Ann Morais,.

and of course we talked of you, and

sent their cordial greetings.

I want especially to mention a book

about-which.you_have.had.some correspondence with the

author, Ethel Bertolini

-She'is sending you a copy

your generous attention, The book, AND MY HEART WAS

semi-documentary account of

the lies of people who faced the bitter struggle

against deportation. These stories of the foreign-born,

and of the remarkable work of the Committee for their

defense, have a warmth and honesty which steins fron

feeling which went into the book.

The book has received a remarkable

from working people-- not only those who

were related to this

experience, but, in general people

who do.not take much interest in "literature" have found

something that touches and

noves them-- and*I imagine

this would be true of this sort of people in other

countries. She has some remarkable letters of the sort)

Sue and I are well,

and both of us are

working harc. I received an invitation from the film goi

association

tion

I in Moscow to come to the cinema celebra-

the fiftyeth. anniversary, but it is not at all

in the foresceable

future.

As I have noted in previous letters,

I am concentrating (along with many incidental and time,

consuming tasks) on my autobiography. I finished one

some fatter comments a decade that tre tirst

and received

some flattering comments,

volume had to

go through the thirties in order to

face the social-political issues. because the account

the cultural

meaning of what is called. "Conmitment" and?!

how it affects

the arts'is the core

of the book

matters,

in my opinion,

confusion.

on which there is wonderiui

I wish

only that we could sit down with you

and Stefan and really

talk about these things. It is

nice to

imagine,

and sad that it cannot be realized.

joins in love to you both, Such
