FAIR PLAX FOR CUBA COMITTEE

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times"

newspaper containe a full-page advertisement captioned "What

Committee (FPCC).

of the FPCC in New York City and declared the FPCC intended to

pronulgate "the truth about revolutionary Cuba" to neutralize

the distorted American press.

"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961,

reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States

Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1y61, Dr•

Charles Ao Santos-Buch identified himself and Robert Taber

as organizers of the FPCC. He also testified he and Taber

obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were

applied

toward the cost of the fore- nentioned advertisement.

On May 16, 1963, a source advised that during

the first two years

of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle

between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (Shi)

elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby influence

FPCC policy.

However, during the past year this source observed

there has been a successful effort by free leadership to mininize

the role of these and other organizations in the FPCC so that today

their influence is negligible.

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that the

National Headquarters of the FPCC is located in Room 329 at 799

1963 the seco

Broadway, New York City. According to this source,

the position

ON 6/96.

of National Office Director was created in the Fall of 1962 and

was filled by Vincent "Ted" Lee,

who now formulates FPCC policy.

This source observed Lee has followed a course of entertaining

and accepting the cooperation of many other organizations

DECLASSIFIED BY 5668

including the CP and the SWP when he has felt it would be to

his personal benefit as well as the fpee's. However,

• Lee has

indicated to this source he has no intention of permitting riu

oolicy to be determined by any other organization. Lee leels th

Prec should advocate resunntion of diplomatic relations betweer

Cuba and the United States and support the right of Cubans to

manage their revolution without interference from other nations,

but not support the Cuban revolution per se.

The CP and the SWiP have been designated pursuant

to Executive Order 10450.
