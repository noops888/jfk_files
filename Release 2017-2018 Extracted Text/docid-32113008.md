My other memorandum on this same subject today describes

the tasking by Deputy Secretary Gilpatric and the handling of this

highly sensitive information. The acquisition of the information

is noted in this present memorandum.

After Deputy Secretary Gilpatric gave me the requirement

last night, I talked to Brûce. Cheever (who was acting for Bill

Harvey while Harvey was out of town). I sketched in the purpose,

which was to get a fix for Gilpatric as one of the U.S. negotiators

with the Soviets on whether or not all actions (sabotage, etc.)

had come to a stop.. I mentioned that this was a sensitive point

brought up by Adlai Stevenson when he talked with the U.s.

negotiators in New York; he didn't want the U.S. embarrassed

and Gilpatric wanted to be sure of this. Cheever commented that

he hoped my memorandum wasn't going to be shown to Stevenson;

I reassured him that I was writing it as an "eyes only" for Gilpatric,

but it must be correct.

I asked about covert operational assets both inside Cuba and

outside, if they had stop orders on actions. Bruce said that they

all had such orders, but pointed out that some of the Cunans were

quite emotional about stopping actions against Casiro and he wasn't

certain that everyone would hold to the orders.

I then asked about assets inside Cuba, did they only have the

two action teams there? How about any psychological operations?

Bruce: said he believed there were only the two teams and would

check further to be sure: He knew the teams were supposed to be

collecting intelligence. As for psychological operations, all CLA

assets had been turned over to USIA. for operational use. I asked

about the balloon operation.

He said that this was not in being yet.

SENSITT

This morning I talked to Bruce again, checking the points

in my memorandum. He said that there were only the two action

teams, a small one (Central Cuba) and the big one (200-man in

Western Cuba), but they definitely were on intelligence collection.

I asked if all others were under control,'no boats going out, etc.

He said yes, but agair pointed out that the Cubans were restive.

I then

asked if any isdependent groups were in motion.

He said

CIA couldn't guaraniae any groups not under CLA control, but that

the word had gotten around to stop actions at this time and none

were known to ClA currently, although maybe there was one not

known to CLA. I commented again that any action would embarrass

the negotiations, which was why I was asking. Bruce said he

understood.

I then checked with Don Wilson, USIA, who confirmed that

all CIA psychological assets had been turned over to USLA for

operational use and were being used as desired by the President.

I checked with Bob Hurwitch, State, to see if he knew of any

actions in preparation or on the way; he said no, everything

appeared to be at a halt. I checked with General Johnson to sèe

if any U.S. military activity might have a Cuban action group.

He said no, there are firm orders holding such actions.

I then wrote the "eyes only" memorandum to show to Mr.

Gilpatric, on "Outline of Covert Operations."
