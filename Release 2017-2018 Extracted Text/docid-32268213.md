Name John David Hurt

Address

โข 201 Hillsborough St., Apt. 4 Place

Raleigh, N.C.

Date 4-11-78

Residence

Time 6:00 p.m

Interview: On Tuesday, April 11, 1978 at approximately 6:00 p.m.

Harold Rose, Jim Kelly and I went to Hurt's home in Raleigh.

It

is located in a small apartment building on a main thoroughfare

in the downtown portion of the city. Hurt's wife, Billie G. Hurt,

answered the door.

Harold identified us and asked for Mr. Hurt.

She let us in and went into the bedroom to get Mr. Hurt. The apart-

ment is small and modestly but neatly furnished.

John Hurt came out of the bedroom where he had been lying in

bed and was clad in neat pajamas. He appeared to be middle-aged

and is relatively short. He suffers from what he described as

arthritis; most of the fingers on both hands are missing and the

remaining fingers are severely cripped. He explained when we

asked about his disability that doctors had amputated his fingers

because the arthritis was so crippling that he would have more use

of his limbs without the fingers. (He in fact handled a cigarette

relatively adeptly.) It is also apparent that his body is covered

in a severe rash which causes the skin to redden and which apparent-

ly stays irritated. He described that condition to us as psoriasis.

As soon as we introduced ourselves, Hurt said he knew we were

there because of the "rumor" about his name or phone number

being on a slip of paper and "the man who killed Kennedy" had

supposedly tried to call him. We asked where he had heard that

rumor and he said people from the "news media" had contacted him

about it. We showed him the telephone slip from the Dallas

County Jail. He acknowledged that the telephone number 834-7430

was and is still his number; however, he stated that he does not

know to whom the other number on the slip, 833-1253, belonged.

Hurt stated that he was at home at the time of the assassination

and that he never received a

call from Oswald or anyone else in

connection with it.

Hurt says he had never heard of Oswald until the assassina-

tion and that it is a complete mystery to him and his wife as to

how his name has come up in this case. We asked for any possible

explanations, and Hurt and his wife could offer none.

However,

his wife (who remained in the room throughout the interview)

stated that at some time around the time of the assassination

the telephone company in Raleigh had mistakenly given their num-

ber to another party and that they received calls intended for

that party for a time. She could not remember exactly when that

occurred or the name of the party, but she thought the calls

they received were local. The Hurts stated that they have had

the same phone number for about. 20 years; they said they had re-

cently moved to their present address at the time of the assassina-

tion, but they had had the number transferred from their other

address in Raleigh.

Mr. Hurt stated that he has never before spoken to nor

been interviewed by anyone from the government about this mat-

ter.. He has had several calls from news media people, but

could not give details of those contacts. He said that about

two months ago he received a call from a woman in Washington

whom he did not identify further, but who wished to come to

Raleigh to speak with him about this. He said that when we

appeared he assumed I was that woman; I assured him I had never

called and did not believe anyone from our Committee had ever

called him.

When asked about his background, Hurt stated that he was in

the Army and that he served in the Army Counterintelligence Corps

(C.I.C.) in Europe and Japan; his dates of service were approxi-

mately 1942-1946. Hurt stated that he enlisted in the service.

When asked about his Intelligence work, he said the work in

Europe involved interviewing nationals of European countries to

determine if they had any connection with the German Secret Police

pursuant to their requests to come to the United States. He said

the people were German, Norwegian and Swedish primarily. He

stated that he was stationed in Japan on Honshu Island near a

place called "Karosawa" (phonetic). He said the only work of any

significanceor particular interest he did there was to stumble

upon a bullion of silver which the Germans were using to trade

with the Japanese.

Hurt stated that his commanding officer in the C.I.C..was

Melville Grimes, who he believes is now practicing law in Baltimore.

He could not give the names of any other men with whom he

served and said he has not had further contact with any of

them. He said his last contact with the military was approxi-

mately 1947, after he resigned, when he received a letter of-

fering him a commission. He declined the offer.

Hurt stated that after his military service he entered the

insurance business, working in claims. He said he was working

for about a year in South Carolina and after that in North

Carolina.

Hurt stated that he received a law degree from the Univer-

sity of Virginia but never practiced.: I do not believe it is

clear from the interview, but my recollection is that he was in

law school before he entered the service.

We asked him if there were any relatives or friends who

might have given his name out loosely to have caused this "con-

fusion" with the Oswald case. Hurt stated that he has no close

relatives, and that no males in his family have his exact name.

We asked if any relatives had lived in Texas or Louisiana.

He

stated that his sister lived for a time in Louisiana, but that

she had moved to South Carolina well before the assassination.

When asked what training Hurt had received to prepare him

for intelligence work, he said he had had none. He said he

received no training in any type of code work. He said the only

language background he had was Spanish, but that it was very

limited.

After the interview Hurt offered to provide any other.

information he could, as he and his wife both expressed the

desire to clear this matter up. They asked what they should

do if they are contacted again by media people. We advised

them that that would have to be their judgment, but that they

could certainly ask their callers to provide sufficient iden-

tifying data or to appear in person. Harold gave Hurt one of

the Committee's business cards so they would recognize us if we

had to contact then again.

We asked how long Hurt had been disabled and he said since

1961. His wife then volunteered that it was 1955 when he be,

came disabled. Hurt said that he is receiving full government

disability. He showed us his Social Security card; the number

is: 107-05-5407-A. He did not know what the notation "A"

stood

for.
