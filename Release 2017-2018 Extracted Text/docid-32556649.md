The Bundeskriminalamt (BKA - West German Federal Criminal

Police) has furnished the following information:

A check of the records available through TWA Airways

in Frankfurt/Main, West Germany, failed to reveal any information

indicating that SUZANNE FUEGER arrived by TWA from New York between

May 12 and May 19, 1965. No passengers lists are maintained on the

local flights of Lufthansa between Frankfurt/Main and Munich,

Germany, and therefore no record on FUEGER could be located

travel between these points.

Further, FUEGER has not beenlocated

at any hotel in Munich.

Inquiries in Munich have revealed that FUEGER's mother,

ELSE ROSE FUEGER, sold her house in the village of Riederau for a

sum of 40,000 Marks, and purchased a flat at 12 Martha-Braeustrasse,

Fuerstenfeldbruck, West Germany. This is a town in the immediate

vicinity of Munich.

Mr. and Mrs. PRASSE, son-in-law and daughter, respectively,

of Mrs. FUEGER, were residing with her in the house in Riederau,

and as of May 18, 1965, were still in the house, although they

planned to move shortly to Nuernberg, West Germany. The inquiries

indicated that the sale of the house

led to quarrels in the family.

Police efforts are continuing to obtain some information

regarding FUEGER's activities. EX I0
