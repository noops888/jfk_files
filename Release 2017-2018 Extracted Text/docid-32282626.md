Watergate.

A new anatomy

of the crime of Dallas."

"Die Weltwoche" has the reputation of having seen better days,

•and of tending toward sensationalism at present.

The articles make allegations as follows:

1.

The Watergate scandal has shown that certain American

politicians are capable of any crime.

Therefore, the

contention that OSWALD was the sole murderer of Pres.

KENNEDY finds less credence than ever.

2.

The film, "Executive Action" seeks to prove that Pres.

KENNEDY was the victim of a right radical conspiracy.

3. Pres. KENNEDY's body was

the subject of a deficient

examination by an unqualified physician.

4. The fact that Pres. KENNEDY intended to reduce the

American engagement in South Vietnam is the real.

reason for his assassination.

5.

The investigation

was restricted to proving the

sole guilt of OSWALD, because otherwise it would

have taken too much time and money.
