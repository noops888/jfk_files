Perjury

51-16-580

In preparation for the trial of the captioned subject,

George F. Callahan, Jr. was interviewed on February 2, 1960.

With reference to money which Mr. Callahan sent to Wein-

heimer in Des Moines, he advised that his best recollection is

that he secured 10 one hundred dollar bills, placed plain white

paper around the bills, and then placed the wrapped bills in three

No. 10 size envelopes.

With reference to the cash sent to Detroit, Mr. Callahan

utilized the same procedure except that only two No. 10 size enve-

lopes were sent and they contained $1,000 in one hundred dollar

bills.

Based upon this information, it is requested that through

your sources at the Post Office you similate the envelopes, paper

and cash in order to determine the weight of such envelopes and

what postage was required in 1957 for their mailing.
