FROM:

SUBJECT:

VINCENT A. SCRO

AR

Set forth below is information furnished by BU 82-C*

on the dates: indicated:

November 22, 1953

JAMES V. LA DUCA advised the informant that the prices

set by the Consolidated and Famous Linen Supply Companies are so

low that the Camellia Linen Supply Co. cannot possibly compete

with them in attempting to obtain certain new customers:

Sub-

sequently, according to the informant, CHARLES A. MONTANA asked

VINCENT SCRO for $50 to put in

"envelope for (FNU) COOK.

LA DUCA later brought up the question with SCRO of'

negotiating with the "association"

and stated that he had talked

with MIKE (LNU)... The subsequent discussion in this regard was

not audible to the informant.

It is possible to conjecture that the "association" referrei

to by LA DUCA is that association in Buffalo to which all linen

supply companies belong, with the acception of the Camellia

Linen Supply Company. The identity of MIKE (LNU) is not known.

Subsequent to hearing the announcement of the death

of President KENNEDY on radio, SCRO remarked to the informant,

"that just goes to prove;

Gumba, you can't step on anybody;

you can't step on anybody!"

November. 23, 24, 25, 26, 1963

No pertinent information.

November 27, 1963

CI advised that CHARLES MONTANA and SCRO had discussed

a company check during which MONTANA asked if there was enough

money to cover it.

SCRO replied that this was just a paper

transaction to his wife, which was being done at the insistence

of an unidentified man at the bank.

This bank employee has to

show where the money is going and has to subordinate these

(checks). SCRO indicated that he was disgusted with the business

involving subordinating.

Subsequently, CI auvised that SCRO, STEVE MAGADDINO

and LA DUCA had a conversation in Italian, which is not compre-

hended by the informant, but which apparently referred to income

tax returns: for the years 1958, 1959 and 1960.

The substance of this conversation, if pertinent

will be made the subject of a separate memorandum when available.

Noverber 28, 1963

No pertinent information.

November 29, 1963

CI advised that SCRO, JAMES LA DUCA, MIKE ERVOLINO

and FRANK ERVOLINO had

an extensive discussion relating to union

matters of Local 168 of the Cleaners and Launderers Union, which

will be the subject of a separate memorandum.

During the source.of the above conversation, SCRO

indicated that JAKIE ROGERS had returned from California, and

was then staying at the Camellia Linen Supply Co. where he acts

in the capacity of a watchman.

During the conversation, ROGERS

indicated that he has additional employment and that his foreman's

name is CHARLIE CICERO, who lives on Jersey Street, in Burfalo.
