MEMORANDUM FOR:

Information Review Officer

Directorate of Operations

FROM:

SUBJECT:

David D. Gries

Director, Center for the study of

Intelligence

Release of Form 362

1. Thank you for your Memorandum of 27 September giving

reasons why the Directorate of Operations should not release Form

362 (used for name traces) under standards of the JFK

Assassinations Records ACt.

After careful review, I do not

believe that it is defensible to withhold the form itself.

Information entered on the form is a separate matter; all or part

of it may be withheld in appropriate cases.

2. The reasons follow:

• The JFK Act requires that a case be made establishing a

clear and convincing link between postponing release of an

assassination record and a threat to intelligence operations

"of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest."

That case cannot reasonably be made for a generic form that

lists a number of offices no longer in existence.

Examples

are the Domestic Collection Division, the Central Reference

Service, and the Central Registry.

Although an updated

version

of this form is still in use, release of the form as

used in the 1970s would not seem to threaten intelligence

operations today.

• As you note in your Memorandum, the fact that name traces

are made in the Directorate of Operations has become public

knowledge.

This would weaken an attempt to defend

postponement by claiming damage to intelligence methods.

i. d.

SUBJECT:

Release of Form 362

• Release of the form would not constitute a precedent.

JFK Act is

a unique piece of legislation; it explicitly does

not establish precedents for other declassification

activities, which are governed by specific laws, such as the

Freedom of Information Act or Privacy Act, or by internal

CIA regulations, such as the Guidelines for Historical

Review.

• The Presidential Review Board, which must approve all

decisions to postpone or redact documents in the JFK

our position.

Let's discuss this further and try to find a

satisfactory resolution, which may lie in releasing more than

one-fourth of the form but less than the complete form.

Please

give me a call at your convenience.
