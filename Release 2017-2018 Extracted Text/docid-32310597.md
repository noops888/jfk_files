DURING THE MEETING [DURAU/CAME UP WITH THE NAME OF LIGA (8(4)

ANTI-COMUNISTA CUBANA LACC) TO BE USED BY IME GROUP.

FINFIOA

SEVERAL PLANS OF ACTION WERE DISCUSSED AT THE MEETING, AND

IT WAS ALSO BROUGHT OUT THAT A MASTER PLAN WAS NEEDED FOR THE

ORGANIZATION. ONE PLAN DISCUSSED WAS THAT ACTS OF VIOLENCE

WOULD BE COMMITTED IN THE U.S., AND THIS GROUP WOULD MAKE IT

APPEAR THAT CASTRO AGENTS FREM CUBA ARE INVOLVED, THUS

CREATING ILL FEELINGS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CUBA. ANOTHER PLAN

DISCUSSED WAS THE RENTING OF SEVERAL APARTMENTS IN VARIOUS

PARTS OF THE U.S., INCLUDING LOS ANGELES AND NEW YORK. ANTI=

CASIRO CUBANS PLAYING THE ROLE OF CASTRO AGENTS COULD DRAW

ATTENTION TO THESE APARIMENIS BY BEING VERY LOUD AND CARRYING

PACKAGES IN AND OUT OF THE APARTMENIS TO MAKE

THEM APPEAR

SUSPICIOUS. WHEN THEY FELT THEY HAD ATTRACTED ATTENTION THEY

WOULD MENTION NAMES OF SEVERAL DIGNITARIES SO THAT THESE NAMES

WOULD FIND THEIR WAY BACK TO THE FBI AND CREATE INVESTIGATIVE

CONFUSION IN THE FBI•

ANOTHER PLAN DISCUSSED WAS THE BLOWING UP OF EVERY LIGHT-

HOUSE IN THE BAHAMAS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CUBA• ANOTHER PLAN

THE ABOVE PLANS WERE MERELY DISCUSSED IN GENERALITIES.

HIRAM GONZALEZ WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT SECURITY OF

LIGA ANTI-COMUNISTA CUBANA• MEMBERS OF LACC ARE NOT TO MENTION

THAT THEY BELONG TO THIS ORGANIZATION. THE WAY THIS

ORGANIZATION IS TO BE RUN IS TO GET SMALL GROUPS TOGETHER TO

DISCUSS PLANS AND NEVER TO HAVE LARGE MEETINGS. THEY FEEL LACC SHOULD

INFILTRATE ALPHA 66, AN ANTI-CASTRO MILITANT ORGANIZATION WITH

NEADQUARTERS IN MIAMI, AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS SO THAT IN

EFFECT VARIOUS

ORGANIZAT IONS WOULD BE CARRYING OUT LACC PLANS.

THIS INFILTRATION WOULD TAKE APPROXIMATELY 809

MONIHS TO BE

PUT INTO OPERATION.
