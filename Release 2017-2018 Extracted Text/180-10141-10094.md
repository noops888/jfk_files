The CIA's written statement replying io the Committee's

request of February 21, 1978 for an explanation of the

criteria that governed

the opening of a 201 file dur-

ing the years 1958-64 was not responsive to our inquiry

because the CIA's written statement did not fodus on the

relevant time period.

Accordingly, I am renewing our

request of February 21, 1978.

in the event chat there

were no criteria governing the opening of such files

during that period, the Committee would appreciate &

written statement indicating that this was the case.

CIA document #563-810 indicates that there are 37 docu

ments that should be in lee Harvey Oswald's 201 file

but which are missing fron the file.

Isthernose, this

document also indicates that there should be a machine

listing of these documerts attached as part of document

#553-810, but no such listing appears in the file. The

Select Committee on Assassinations rsquests thai th:

•CIA provide a listing of such documents as well as a

witten explanation of where those documents are 10-

cated and

Why they co not appear in oswald's 201 file.

Pursuant to my setter of December 27: 1977, I vould like

to note that

the document referred to ir this paragraph

is a classified document.

9)

after having reviewed both the documents contained in

the CIA's files on Priscilla Johnson Nonillan and the

materials that were independently made availabia to her

under the Privacy Act, it is apparent

tat the Files

which were made availabie to the Comities did not in-

clude HTLINGUAI materials. As the comistee hes

already requested ali information contained in your

files on the individuals who are the subjects of our

requests, please

review the files that you have pre-

viously made available to us for the purpose of ensui-

ing that all of the information pertaining to the

individuals invoived has, in fact, veer arovided.

Finally, the Connittee would like to interview all persons

the CIA's

1954, as f

station for that period.

the Committee requests that the CIA
