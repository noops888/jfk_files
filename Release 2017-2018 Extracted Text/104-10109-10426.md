_Security Officer

Director of Security

Bernard L. BARKER - #201333

7 August 1964

1. Reference is made to your memorandum of

5 August 1964, concerning loss of U. S. Citizenship

of the subject.

2. It is the opinion of this Staff that at this late

date subject has no recourse to overturn the Depart-

ment of State's ruling that he lost his U: S. Citizen-

ship by his accepting employment in the Cuban Govern -

ment. To protect the U. S. Citizenship of an individual

who engages in activities which would normally expatriate

himself requires prior agreement between this Agency and the

Department of State. This was not done in subject's case.

Then, too, subject, by his application for and acceptance of

an immigration visa to enter the U. S. as a permanent resi-

dent alien, is in effect, an admission by him of loss of his

previous U. S. Citizenship.

3.

As a permanent resident alien he must await the

expiration of five years residence before he can petition

for naturalization unless a private bill were introduced to

waive the residence requirement.

4. It is believed that a review of subject's file at the

Department of State would not reveal any information

which would change subject's status.
