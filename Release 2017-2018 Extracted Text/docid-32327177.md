Room 602. The envelope was given to a bailiff introduced

as AL CYEENEY (phonetic).

CERONE indicated to source

this was a monthly envelope and that if he got in trouble

he would

arrange for his case to be brought before Judge

STARK.

Informant also advised the bookmaking operation

of JACK CERONE won $18,000 from customers placing sports

Of this amount about $4,500 was from the Green Bay :

Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl contest.

Source stated the

game closed with Kansas City a thirteen point underdog.

As all customers took Kansas City and Green Bay won thirty-

five to ten, all of the customers

Informant has every reason to believe he will be

given a "good job" by CERONE if CERONE is satisfied with

his work.

3. CG 7049-PC and CG 6890-C-TE

As the Bureau is aware, both of these sources

have furnished information concerning gambling activities

of the SAM BATTAGLIA group in Melrose Park, Illinois.

As a result of this information, the

following gambling

raids were made by state and county law enforcement offices

who received information concerning these activities from

the Chicago Office:

On the early morning of 1/16/67, RICHARD DERRICO,

one of the key operators, was observed entering the gambling

location at 2413 West Lake Street.

Since this gambling

location is also a large scale horse and sports bookmaking

operation during the day, all information regarding this

location was furnished to Sergeant MICHAEL O'MARA, Cook

County Sheriff's Police, who raided premises at 1:00 p.m.

on 1/16/67.

Entry was gained to the gambling room by

smashing through two front doors, one barricaded with two

reinforcement bars, revealing professional casino type

setup in back game

room, including kidney shaped poker

table with elevated platform for dealer, smaller poker table,

CG 137-4143

as well as professional cloth covers for tables. Arrested

was RICHARD JOSEPH DERRICO, who was charged as gambling

keeper.

Confiscated were numerous race horse bet slips

recovered from DERRICO's person, as well as volumes of

other race

horse and sports betting slips, scratch sheetsh

ledger sheets used for pro football betting, sports parlay

cards, numerous decks of cards and dice, two poker tables

and miscellaneous gambling paraphernalia, all valued at

$2,000.

DERRICO admitted to Bureau Agents gambling activities

as evidenced by bet slips found on his person but denied

large scale casino type operation at this location. No

indication of any interstate activity.

Additional

records

discovered

at site of raid included names, addresses and

phone numbers of numerous hoodlums within SAM BATTAGLIA

group.

Sergeant O'MARA expressed great satisfaction over

results of raid, especially in view of the fact this was

the third successful gambling raid within city limits of

Melrose Park, Illinois, in the past three days. O'MARA

in news release gave the FBI credit for another significant

raid in hoodlum stronghold of BATTAGLIA group.

Information regarding the GUY CERVONE gambling

operation at 2111 West Lake, Melrose Park, Illinois, was

furnished

to JOSEPH WOODS, Cook County Sheriff, who at

11:30 p.m., 1/13/67, led a detail of his men. The raiding

party smashed through heavily barricaded rear and front

doors simultaneously to gain entry to the first floor

premises.

Individuals were observed gambling in two rooms.

Eleven persons were arrested including WILLIAM DEL PERCIO,

ELMER DEL PERCIO, GERALD NARGIE and ANGEL PACHECO, all of |

vhom are part of

the SAM BATTAGLIA hoodlum gang.

ELMER

DEL PERCIO was charged as gambling keeper.

Over one

thousand dollars in cash,

plus gambling paraphernalia

valued in excess of $3,000 was confiscated.

Information

regarding the gambling operation at

Square Deal Auto Wreckers, owned by JOE DOM SCACCIA, was

furnished at 11:30 p.m., 1/13/67, to JOHN NEWBOLD, Chief of

Crime Section, Illinois Sheriff's Police, who led a raid

with his men on Square Deal. They smashed through the front

door to gain entry

to the gambling room located in the

center of a compostie structure, revealing plush gambling

den with after hours bar, along with dozens of decks of

playing cards, card table, records of race horse bets,

scratch sheets, siot machine, and miscellaneous gambling

paraphernalia, all valued at $1,000.

SCACCIA was charged

as keeper of a gambling house.

Four others on the scene

were released because of lack of evidence.

Records seized

disclosed that this location obviously functioned as

bookmaking operation during the day.

WOODS and NEWBOLD in news releases gave full

credit to the FBI for initiating a successful raid which

is receiving excellent coverage in the Chicago news media

due to notorious reputation of Melrose Park as a hoodlum

stronghold and this being the first raid conducted by

Sheriff WOODS,

4. CG 6688-PC

On 1/16/67 informant advised that his business

had expanded at a faster rate than he anticipated, which

resulted in him becoming

involved in a financial crises

to meet expansion needs.

He said that his position was

such that unless he could come up with $15,000 immediately

business would fail.

As a result, he got together withl

who has backed him financially in the past, who

took him to an individual informant did not name (however,

indicated to be

"MILWAUKEE PHIL" ALDERISIO) to borrow the

$15,000 on "juice".

Informant said that he figured that it

would be a very short term loan and that while he knew it

was poor judgment on his part to become so involved, he

felt that it was the best way to overcome his difficulty.

He went on to say that almost immediately thereafter, the

person who lent him the money demanded a share of the

business.

Informant claims that he became very distressed

over his situation and actually contemplated going on a

"score" in an effort to raise the money in order to pay the

$15,000 debt.

He then got together with

and

the two of them went to see the individual. Informant

demanded to be released from the obligation which resulted

in a violent argument.

The person picked up a chair and

threatened to hit the informant with it. After an exchange

OTHER 4

of threats, the informant left and contacted other friends

of his high in the syndicate. Informant claims that he

is in the process of settling the matter although he is

paying

two per cent weekly on the loan of $15,000; however,

he expects to get the full $15,000 paid by approximately

1/20/67, at which time he will

be released from this

obligation.

Informant advised that prior to the time he went

into prison, he had been operating a "juice" venture backed

by

He said that they lost approximately $80,000

in this venture.

He explained that because he had to go

to prison,

he was unable to enforce collections and the

people that were supposed to take care of the collections

him failed him.

He said that GUS RUINO took him for

$10, 000.

He said that he had collected some of the money

including a large amount from "NICK THE GREEK" (believed

to be NICK KOKENAS). He added that he took MARSHALL

CAIFANO with him to see NICK, which resulted in NICK paying

up.

5. CG 7049-PC

Informant mentioned that "TEETS" BATTAGLIA is

now the real boss of the outfit.

He described him as the

"tightest guy" he has ever come across.

Informant said

BATTAGLIA is

"loaded" and yet about three weeks ago he

chased a small time gambler half way through Melrose Park

and beat the guy up just because he owed him $320. He

said BATTAGLIA watches all gambling games in this

area very

close and nobody gets away with anything. He said that he

is also a great guy to utilize free labor on his farm.

There are always small time hoods who are looking for favors

and trying to get in good with BATTAGLIA. He said these

punks often get "sucked" into performing sizeable jobs

for BATTAGLIA, thinking that they are going to gain his

favor. Informant said none of these guys are ever recognized

by BATTAGLIA, who regards them as "dopes". Informant said

BATTAGLIA chooses to avoid any publicity, and since

GIANCANA fled to Mexico and wants out of the organization,

BATTAGLIA knows any

heat will be focused on him. BATTAGLIA

goes out of his way to keep his name from being used. He

also dislikes being used as an arbiter in an argument.

Whenever there is trouble between some members of the

outfit, they are steered to NICK PALERMO and CHARLES

NICOLETTI, who generally settle the dispute without any

further reference to BATTAGLIA.

BATTAGLIA's chauffeur, "JOSE", is also rising

in the outfit in the western suburbs, and like JOHN

TARRARA (phonetic) is a coming member of the top circle

in the Melrose Park area.

TARRARA got his clout from his

prior association with "PAUL THE WAITER" RICCA. BOBBY

DOER is also a leading syndicate hoodlum and in control

of several profitable enterprises for the outfit in the

western suburban area.

The Charm Club, which had been controlled by

DOER, has been closed and operations are moving from this

site to the Old Chicken House on North Avenue in Melrose

Park.

This place has been remodeled and is now called

the Country Pub.

They are having a grand opening 1/19 or

20/67, and no doubt this will become a hangout for syndicate

members.

While this place was being remodeled, BOBBY DOER

was constantly checking on its progress.

It has become

known that once operations start at the Country Pub, DOER

will be in complete control and probably will use this as

his hangout.

Informant said that discussions among members

of the syndicate concerning JOE SHINE are amusing.

Some

say he is being persecuted and others say he is nothing but

a "stupe". The outfit, according to one source, would like

to. "throw him a bone"

up with

something the "Government" is on top of him. In a recent

discussion by several local characters concerning SHINE,

it was said that SHINE has no future in the Melrose Park

area and the outfit cannot see

where he can fit in. They

also plan to do nothing about it.

Word has gotten around town that the syndicate

has given up on Strangers in the Night. Word has gotten

around to sell the club building and all, and salvage what

they can.

There have been no offers coming to informant's

attention, but the building has been observed by informant

daily and appears to be abandoned. Informant said the

syndicate has a quarter of a million dollars standing in

that building and it is costing them money everyday.

The informant said

has enjoyed their profits and he can stick with their

trom talk around worse part lAter outy cross /

Informant stated that one of the most profitable

deals involving the police and a few politicians

at the

present time is a judicial setup at Oak Park, Illinois.

Informant stated under the new judicial system the magistrate

court in Oak Park handles all cases from a number of

surrounding towns, including Melrose Park. Whenever a

felony charge is

and states attorney in charge of this court, a lot of

as attorney uncharge

brought to the attention of the judge

wheeling and dealing

goes on.

The judge's name was recalled

as CONFIST (phonetic), and the states attorney's name is

ROMAN. Wherever these two can do it, they will attempt to

reduce a felony charge to a misdemeanor and shake down the

defendants involved.

This is generally done through the

attorney representing the defendant. The informant said

that one police officer told him the only way he could be

sure that a felony rap would be approved by the Oak Park

Court and sent to the Grand Jury at 26th and California

was to threaten ROMAN or the judge with publicity.

police officer also told him the only other way it has

worked to satisfaction is for the police officer to tell

ROMAN or the judge that he has a personal interest in this

case and plead that it be presented to the Grand Jury

indictment.

If ROMAN or the judge feel there will be any

trouble, they will avert this.

Informant said concerning recent robberies in

the area, namely the robbery of a National Tea Store on

West Madison Street in Chicago and the Armored Express job

at North Riverside, Illinois, that the individuals involved

could well be part

of the six member gang that hit the

individuals

were named as:

These

JOSEPH LOMBARDI, JR.

MARIO DE ANGELIS

FRANK DE ROSA, JR.

GUY CERVONE

JOHN DE MARIA

ANTHONY SCUDIERO

One of the reasons informant suspects these

individuals is that he has received word that they are

very active and that they are doing so with the full

cooperation and consent of BOBBY DOER.

From his personal

knowledge, informant said, he knows that LOMBARDI and

DE ANGELIS are loaded with money and are spreading it

all over. He has seen them in frequent contact with DOER

in recent weeks, and DOER has continually made a check

through a police

department contact known to the informant

concerning the above individuals to see if any "heat" is

on them.

Informant said that his contact on the police

department was discussing the activity of these men, that

they were making money, that the modus operandi used at

the National Tea

Store was similar to the U. S. Bargain

Town in Melrose Park, and that if there was a weak link

par read the dosa

in this gang it was FRANK DE ROSA, JR.

Informant said

that if this police officer from the Melrose Park Police

Department is on the level, he will grab DE ROSA and try

and break him down.

However, informant said this is hardly

possible as no police officer can do this on his own in

Melrose Park.

Informant stated that the word has gotten around

that BOBBY DOER has to clear any holdup activity in the

Melrose Park area.

Informant stated that a week or two ago he was

having coffee in a restaurant on Mannheim Road. He noticed

SCHANG.

He then realized that they were talking about

PAT SCHANG, whom they consider to be a possible Government

witness in the case involving WILLIE DADDANO, JOHN VARELLI,

ROCKY INFELICE, MIKE D'ALESSIO, all top hoodlums, and

other hoodlums

involved in a federal indictment charging

them with the theft of silver and photographic material

from interstate shipments (Chicago files 15-26351,

15-26968, 15-26263

and 15-25085).

Informant gathered

from listening to these "characters" that any one of them

would do anything possible to locate SCHANG and kill him.

It was informant's opinion that there is no contract letter

out, as such. Informant said, however, that it is understood

by all members of the criminal outfit not only in Melrose

Park but anywhere in this area, that there is a good price

on SCHANG's head, that anyone able to do anything about

would be well rewarded, and that there is

no doubt that efforts are being made by any number of

individuals on their own and collectibly to find SCHANG

and kill him.

Informant stated that he has heard from some

individuals that if SCHANG is caught, he will not be given

the benefit of a quick demise. The individuals discussing

SCHANG said that they would return him to this area and

torture him to death, thereby making an example of him.

Informant stated that from his own knowledge and discussion

with "these people", they have definitely been hurt by

the been me enter eaten see us actively

engaged in criminal activities in the Chicago area.

He

stated that the crushing blow concerning criminal activity

was the arrest of WILLIE DADDANO, who was regarded as

untouchable. Informant stated this seemed to shake their •

confidence,

and where there had been hijackings, robberies,

and wholesale thefts on a weekly basis prior to

this whole-

sale arrest, activity has slowed down to an occasional job.

Informant stated that should any information come

to his

attention concerning inquiries on PAT SCHANG, he will so

advise.

One person contacted

on this matter by informant

said he had heard SCHANG was

"on the street and in some

town in Wisconsin".

Informant stated SCHANG's whereabouts

is of daily concern to a number of individuals.

On 1/16/67 informant was discussing "MILWAUKEE

PHIL"' ALDERISIO. He stated that he had known ALDERISIO .

for many years.

He went on to say that it was a mystery

to him how ALDERISIO ever advanced in the criminal

organization in Chicago.

He said that ALDERISIO is an

uncouth; savage, rough individual, whom he considers

anything but brilliant.

He said,

however,

that apparently

ALDERISIO either has a lot of money himself at the present

time, or is being backed by people who do. He mentioned

that

he had seen ALDERISIO in recent months and that

ALDERISIO had offered to invest money with the informant

in any type venture the informant desired. (It is to be

noted that the informant is a man of considerable wealth.)

Informant told ALDERISIO that he would not be interested.

Informant stated that ALDERISIO told him that he was

desirous of putting his money into legitimate enterprises.

Informant said that it is his opinion that the outfit

would have no control over money invested by ALDERISIO

and it was strictly his own undertaking. He pointed out

that since the decline of prostitution, other vice and

gambling, that apparently members of the outfit are more

or less operating on their own and trying to make it

legitimate.

He said in the old days it was easy for them

to muscle in on gambling and other illegitimate operations

and the money derived from these activities would go back

into the syndicate.

Informant stated it appeared to him that MARSHALL

KORSHAK was a cinch to be elected Treasurer of the City

of Chicago. He said that although he had given a party for

KORSHAK for fund raising purposes during the recent

election, he did not intend to do it during this contest.

Informant displayed a silver star that he had

pinned to his billfold.

The star represented him as an

investigator for the Illinois State Legislature. He said

that he had received this star from

someone presently in

the Legislature that he helped elect.

Informant advised on 1/13/67 that-CHARLES-

SIRAGUSA,former Chief of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics,

New York, and currently Director of the Illinois Crime

Commission, State of Illinois, approached JOHN D'ARCO,

Chicago, incumbent Ward

former Alderman, lst Ward, "tool" of the Chicago crime

Committeeman, and alleged

syndicate, requesting his approval, sanction, and backing

for SIRAGUSA 's candidacy as

Ist Ward Alderman in the

forth coming Aldermanic election in Chicago.

D'ARCO reportedly contacted unidentified persons

and told SIRAGUSA that he would not be considered as an

Aldermanic candidate and strongly advised against his

filing.

It is noted that the incumbent lst Ward

Alderman DON PARILLO has again filed his petition and will

run.

SIRAGUSA did not file.

8. CG 6498-C-TE (Former)

Informant advised he has learned RICHARD/CAIN,/

former Chief Investigator, Cook County Sheriff's Office;

telephonically contacted RICHARD BOGILVIE, his former

and advised he had just

trip "to San Francisco". CAIN stated he wanted to meet .

with OGILVIE 1/13/67 on

a very important matter.

When

OGILVIE refused to meet with CAIN, CAIN told, him it was -

important for the Republican Party that JOHN WANER

Republican candidate for Mayor, Chicago, be put in touch

indicated he wanted to "trade" the information for "a favor".

Since it is known that CAIN has just returned

from a stay with GIANCANA in Mexico, it is possible that

he is carrying a message regarding a bribe to be used

by WANER for campaign purposes or does, in fact, have

information given him by GIANCANA which can be used against

- 11 -

NW 45742 DocId: 32327177 Page 12

## Page 13

CG 137-4143

DALEY.

In any event, it would definitely appear CAIN is

performing a task for the Chicago hoodlum group.

Attention

in this regard is directed to information provided by a

confidential source that Chicago group through intermediary

offered campaign funds

to BENJAMIN ADAMOWSKI when he ran

for Mayor against DALEY. It is also noted that since it is

known CAIN recently associating with PETER GRANATA, tool

of Chicago group in Illinois Legislature, he may be being

used in political area by the Chicago group.

CAIN is known to have been divorced by his

Mexican wife and now living with HARRIET BLAKE, singer who

appeared some time ago at the College Inn of the Sherman

House.

Number furnished by CTE (Former) where CAIN can

be reached 1/13/67, is listed to HARRIET BLAKE, 5436 North

Central Avenue, Chicago.

CTE (Former) advised that ANTHONY G. GIROLAMI,

Democratic Ward Committeeman, 28th Ward, Chicago, finds

himself in a poor position in that his protege, ANGELO

PROVENZANO, present Alderman, has refused to run for

re-election.

Chicago hoodlum group instrumental in having

JOSEPH JAMBRONE file for that Aldermanic office. JAMBRONE'S

connections with the Chicago group is so well known in the

28th Ward that

no candidate could be found to run against

him except three Negroes. As a result, JAMBRONE is a

definite favorite to win. GIROLAMI feels this will be

a blow against law enforcement in view of JAMBRONE's obvious

close association with such highly placed Chicago hoodlums

as JACK CERONE, JOSEPH GAGLIANO and WILLIAM MESSINA.

On

the other hand, GIROLAMI will lose face with Mayor DALEY

and lose power in the Ward if a Negro candidate should beat

JAMBRONE.

GIROLAMI's recourse is to "drag feet" while

pretending to assist JAMBRONE's campaign.

B. Penetration of the LCN

1. CG 6933-C-TE

Informant advised he visited ROCCO PRANNO,

prominent Chicago hoodlum presently confined in

Federal Penitentiary, Terre Haute, Indiana, on 1/15/67,

with Mrs. PRANNO.

100, ranc

PRANNO, who was confined with GIANCANA

in Cook County Jail when GIANCANA was released 5/31/66

told CTE that GIANCANA is completely disgusted with his

circumstances at time of release. PRANNO related

GIANCANA's morale completely shattered, and GIANCANA told

him he intended to completely disassociate himself from

organized crime and "go to an island and relax for the

rest of his life". PRANNO stated GIANCANA is convinced

the Government would call him back before the Federal

Grand Jury and continue intensive efforts to reconfine.

PRANNO told CTE that GIANCANA felt the Government

would always focus primary investigative efforts on

the leader of organized crime and GIANCANA did not desire

to spend any more time in confinement. GIANCANA made

obscene comments about his associates and stated he

intended to "Leave everything behind. They can have

everything I got."

PRANNO informed CTE that the feeling is that

GIANCANA may have

"flipped" over to the side of the FBI

upon his release, since GIANCANA has not been subpoenaed

back before the Federal Grand Jury or in any other way

subjected to any type of prosecutive action. PRANNO feels

GIANCANA must have made some type of "deal"

with the

Government in return for this consideration.

PRANNO told the informant that when GIANCANA

left the County Jail, he gave PRANNO his watch and ring.

PRANNO said that when he arrived at the Terre Haute

Penitentiary, he was wearing the wristwatch, which was

contrary to prison rules. Immediately, other inmates

',, claiming that because PRANNO was a top syndicate

man from Chicago, he could get special privileges.

wristwatch was taken away from PRANNO.

PRANNO told the

informant that it had been difficult for him to overcome

- 13 -

NW 45742 DocId: 32327177 Page 14

---

## Page 15

CG 137-4143

the reputation that he has in the penitentiary.

Because

he is considered to be a Chicago syndicate figure, many

of the inmates have attempted to surround him, do special

favors and so forth.

This includes Doctor BRUNI, who

allegedly has syndicate connections in Chicago.

PRANNO

told him that

such attention works to his disadvantage

and causes prison officials to keep a closer watch on him.

At the present time PRANNO's main contacts are a couple

of minor hoodlums who are in Terre Haute on lesser charges.

PRANNO told the informant that he is thoroughly

disgusted with his attorney, RICHARD DEVINE.

He stated

emphatically to the informant that he was "sold out by his

DEVINE's services were arranged for by

"MILWAUKEE PHIL" ALDERISIO. PRANNO told the informant

that after he was sentenced to fifteen years, he threatened

DEVINE that he would kill him and told him that he had done

the job of a fourteen year old kid. He further told DEVINE

that on appeal matters he intended to have a stenographer

in court so he could be sure of what DEVINE said and

cautioned him that it had better be right.

In the presence of the informant, Mrs. PRANNO

told her husband that MIKE MARINO had been visiting her

quite often and seemingly asking questions concerning

PRANNO which aroused her suspicions.

(It is to be noted

that CG 6933-C-TE has advised that it is his opinion that

MARINO is acting as a scout for the outfit relative to

PRANNO.) PRANNO told his wife that the next time MARINO

showed

up, she should spit in his face and tell him that he

told her to do it.

PRANNO told the informant that he was aware of

that fact

that JOE SHINE was getting into trouble with the

overnment.

He said the outfit is doing the same to SHINE

that they did to him.

He said further that he understands

the "beefers" for the Government in this case are SEIDLER,

BILL DE VITTO, and the contractor. Although PRANNO hates

SHINE,

he declared that he would never testify against him

and said that if he gets involved in the matter he is going

to take the 5th Amendment.
