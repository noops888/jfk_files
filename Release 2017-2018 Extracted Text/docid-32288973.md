Mr. RUBEN CAUSA, Casino Manager, Flamboyan Hotel,

Santurce on June 6, 1966.

Sheriff's office,

having address 3718 McBerry, had been arrested March 31,

1963 for possession of lottery and conducting a lottery and

at the time of arrest he had listed his date of birth as

June 17, 1924 at Havana, Cuba.

Records further reflect on

January 25, 1965 this individual had been placed on 2 years

probation after originally having been sentenced on May 20,

1963 to serve one year in jail.

On June 8, 1966 TP. T-3 viewed a photograph of ART

PRICE, also known as ARTURO MISURACA and stated does not

associate this' individual with SANTO TRAFFICANTE and to his

knowledge has never heard any of SANTO TRAFFICANTE's associates

speak of ART PRICE.

On May 25, 1966 TP T-8 advised that although he

is of Italian descent and his family originally came from

Sicily, it so happens that his family is the only family

from a particular section of Sicily and is not from the part

of Sicily where the TRAFFICANTE's originated.

TP T-8 stated

that several years ago he had been a member of the Italian

Club in Tampa and had become a very close personal friend of

SANTO TRAFFICANTE. TP T-8 stated that he was so friendly

that SANTO had at one time offered to underwrite all of

TP T-8's medical expenses in connection with an operation

which he, TP T-8, had had. TP T-8 stated he always considered

SANTO TRAFFICANTE as an individual on whose words you could

rely and although he has heard many times that TRAFFICANTE

is engaged in gambling operations he has no personal knowledge

concerning any such activity.

TP T-8 stated that he had

never heard the name La Cosa Nostra until

about 3 years ago

but of course heard on many occasions of the "black: hand"

TP I-8 stated that he had heard of the "black hand" prior to

coming to Tampa but has no specific information concerning

the organization and could not swear that TRAFFICANTE was

ever a member of the "black hand"
