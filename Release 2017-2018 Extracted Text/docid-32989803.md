Richard Vernon Secora, U.S. AIR FORCE; POTENTIAL COMPENSATION

was opened in May, 1982, and was closed in

December, 1984,

without any prosecution of subjects resulting.

The investigation

lobbyist for Defense-related contractors on Capitol Hill.

Alexandria submitted a 58 page letterhead. memorandum dated

5/7/84, which set forth results of investigation conducted

in this matter and which included a synopsis.

IHM was submitted to Bureau on 12/3/84, in this matter.

The file in this case consists of two volumes.

Recommendation of Alexandria Division:

than xerox the voluminous volumes and documents that comprise

the above two mentioned main files regarding

General SECORD,

that the Alexandria division deliver these files

to FBIHQ

for referral to by Congressional officials desiring such,

at FBIHQ.

(Alexandria has previously forwarded files to

FBIHQ in connection with FOIA requests.)

Leads for the Baltimore and San Francisco Divisions:

Baltimore and San Francisco should consider reviewing

above referred to Baltimore and San

Francisco main files

for any additional information possibly pertinent regarding

ALBERT HAKIM and/or General RICHARD V. SECORD, that has

not been previously reported to the Bureau in connection

with FBIHQ responses requested from the field in reference

in the first paragraph of this airtel.

Church's

By William Safire

WASHINGON, Nov. 19-On Oct. 10,

1963, the then-Attorney General of the

United. States put nis personal signa-

ture on a document that launched and

legitimatized one of the most horren-

dous abuses of Federal police power in

this century.

In Senator Frank Church's subcom-

mittee hearing room this week, the

authorized

wiretapping

and

subse-

quent

unauthorized bugging and at-

tempted blackmailing of Martin Luther

King Jr. is being gingerly examined,

with the "investigation" conducted in

such a way as not to unduly em-

barrass officials of the Kennedy or

Johnson Administrations.

With great care, the committee has

focused on the F.B.I. Yesterday, when:

the committee counsel first set forth.

the result of shuffling through press

clips, it seemed as if no Justice De-!

partment had existed in 1962; today,

an F.B.I. witness pointed out that it

was Robert Kennedy who authorized

the wiretap of Dr. King, and that "the

President of the United States and the

Attorney General specifically discussed

their concern of Communist influence

with Dr. King."

But the Church committee showed

no zest for getting further to the Ken-

nedy root of this precedent to Water-

gate eavesdropping. If Senator Church

were willing to let the chips fall where

they may, he would call some knowl-

edgeable

witnesses into the glare of

the camera lights and ask them some

questions that have gone unasked for

• thirteen years.

For example, he could call Nicholas

Katzenbach,

Attorney General Ken-

• nedy's deputy and successor, and ask

what he knows of the Kennedy de-

cision to wiretap Dr. King.

Who at

Justice concurred in the recommenda-

tion? How does the F.B.l. know the

President was consulted or informed?

After Mr. Katzenbach assumed of-!

fice, and the wiretapping continued,

he was told by angry newsmen that

the F.B.I. was leaking scurrilous in-

formation about Dr. King. Why did he

wait for four months, and for a thou-

sand telephonie interceptions, to dis-

continue the officially approved tap?

Of course, this sore or testimony

would erode Senator Church's political

base. That is why we do not see for-

mer Assistant F.B.I. director Cartha

(Dcke)

Deloach,

Lyndon

Johnson's

personal contact with the F.B.I. in the

witness chair.

What did President

Johnson

know aboul the character

assassination slot and unen did he

know it? What conversations took

viace between Mr. Deloach aud Presi-

dent Johnson on the tapping of Dr.

1.ing or about the use oi the F.B.I. in

awv ciber intrusions into ihe lves of

Cover-Up

The committee is not asking embar-

rassing questions even when answers

are readily available. A couple of

weeks ago, at an open hearing, an

F.B.I. man inadvertently started

to

blurt out an episode about newsmen

who were weritapping in

the ayerrent kople of stories

General Kennedy. The too-willing wit

ness was promptly shooshed into si

lence, and told that such information

would be developed only in executive

• session. Nobody raised an eyebrow.

That pattern of containment by the

Church committee is vividly shown by

the handling of the buggings at the

ESSAY

ventions which were ordered by Lyn.

don Johnson. Such invasions of politi-

cal headquarters were worse than the

crime committed at Watergate, since

they involved the use of the 'F.B.I.,

but the Church investigators seem to

be determined not to probe too deeply.

If F.B.I. documents say that reports

were made to specific Johnson

aides,

why

are those men not

given the

same opportunity to publicly tell their

story so avidly given the next Presi-

dent's men? If Lyndon Johnson com-

mitted this impeachable high crime of

using the F.B.I. to spy on political,

opponents, who can be brought for-

ward to tell us all about it?

But that would cause embarrass-

ment to Democrats,

and

Senator

Church wants to embarrass profes-

sional employees

of

investigatory

agencies only. A new sense of Con-

gressional decorum exists, far from

the sense of outrage expressed in the

Senate Watergate committee's hear-

ing room. When it is revealed that the

management of NBC News gave press

credentials to L.B.J.'s spies at the 1964

convention, every body alushes demureng

ly-and nobody demands to

which network executive made what

decision under what pressure.

I have been haranguing patient

readers for years about the double

standard applied to Democratic and

Republican political crimes, and had

hoped the day would come when the

hardball precedents set by the Ken-

nedy and Johnson men would be laid

before the public in damning detail.

Obviously, Democrat Frank Church

is not the

man to do it. His jowl

shaking indignation is all too selec-

live: the trail

of high-level responsi

bility for the crimes committed against

Dr. King and others is evidentiy going

to be allowed to cooi.

Pity. You'd think that after ail the

nation has been thrcugh in the past

few years, our political leaders would

have learned that the one thing that

brings you down is the act of cover-

ing up.
