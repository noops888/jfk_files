A source provided the following information:

In April, 1961; an individual known only as MAX

was contacted by a person known only as PHIL "THE STICK"

in New York City.

MAX was a "hit man" and was instructed

by PHIL "THE STICK" to go to Florida where he would be

paid $1,000 a week. MAX went to the Carousel Hotel in

Miami Beach and met with SAM GIANCANA. GIANCANA told him

he was going to meet an individual not part of the "mob"

and then introduced him to STURGIS, a CIA Agent described

pa ice corsete in the oorenoke Brand

These target practices, which were held daily, were in

conjunction with four unknown individuals who came from

other parts of the country.

or their identities. In their first target practice in the

swamps, STURGIS gave MAX a .38 caliber revolver and asked

fire at a target approximately 30 feet away. MAX

shot and STURGIS appeared to be satisfied. STURGIS then

gave MAX an Ml Carbine which MAX fired and STURGIS was

again satisfied. STURGIS then instructed MAX in the use

of Thompson Submachine Guns inasmuch as MAX was not familiar

with them.

Around May 18, 1961, MAX met with GIANCANA, JOHN

ROSELLI, and STURGIS, who told him, MAX, among others, was

"to "hit" the dictator of the Dominican Republic, RAFAEL

TRUJILLO. MAX was introduced to ANGELO MARADANO (phonetic)

who spoke fluent Spanish. It was decided MARADANO would

play the part of MAX's father with MAX being a mute, thus

hiding the fact that MAX could not speak Spanish.

cover story for these two individuals was that MARADANO

was going to the Dominican Republic to purchase tobacco.

On May 18, 1961, MAX and ANGELO MARADANO flew

instructions to leave the luggage in the cab, walk through

the hotel, and get in another cab out the back door of the

hotel. This they did, and then were driven to a home outside

Domingo where they were introduced to WILLIAMS, another

CIA man described as a white male, 6'2", 210 pounds.

home where they were taken had the appearance of an armed

camp. WILLIAMS gave them maps of the Dominican Republic

and Santo Domingo and told them to study them. These maps

were written both in Spanish and in English with a number

of them having a Library of Congress stamp on them, and

others indicating in Spanish that they were military maps.

MAX still has these maps and they are available if wanted.

WILLIAMS indicated it would be very hard to "hit"

TRUJILLO inasmuch as TRUJILLO changed routes daily, going

back and forth from his office to the palace and was protected

by sharp shooters.

a ning of day so, ere a was going

cut tay on out in a nice chevrotot

by a jeep.

In order to fool people, another white Chevrolet

and jeep would follow him some 10 to 15 miles.

In the afternoon of May 30, 1961, MAX, MARADANO,

WILLIAMS, and unknown others of Spanish descent, went in

two jeeps to find a place to "hit" TRUJILLO. A suitable

place was found near a port city, which could be located

on the map if necessary.

Around midnight on May 30, the jeep and the white

Chevrolet with TRUJILLO appeared. Six men in the first

jeep "took out" TRUJILLO's jeep, disabling the radio and

tires.

MAX, the driver, WILLIAMS, and MARADANO, pulled up

next to TRUJILLO in the white Chevrolet and MAX and MARADANO

killed him, using Thompson Submachine Guns. These machine

guns had two clips of shells in each.

Approximately 6 hours later, after doubling back,

they returned to Santo Domingo and departed four days later,

arriving in Miami Beach via Mexico City, Port au Prince,

Haiti,

in the Bahamas, all traveling by commercial airlines.

Once they arrived in Miami Beach, STURGIS paid MAX and

MARADANO $30,000 a piece.

Present during/this payoff was SAM'

GIANCANA, who

told MAX to contact PETE BRADY, a pit boss in the Desert

Inn in Las Vegas, concerning a

Nevade

hit" in Havana, Cuba.

Apparently, BRADY had been working at the Capri Casinc

in Havana and was familiar with the area.

In mid June, 1961, contact was made by MAX with

BRADY utilzing the services of JOHNNY GEORGE, a gambler Neo

in Las vegas, currently building the Atlantis Hotel in

Las Vegas.

"BRADY indicated to MAX'he was instructed by

someone whom he did not name that he was supposed to

tell MAX all about Havana and the Hilton Hotel there.

It was assumed by MAX that he was being instructed so

that he could "hit" FIDEL CASTRO.

After receiving information from BRADY, MAX

returned to Miami Beach where he continued to target practice.

A short while later, MAX learned that GIANCANA had a "run in"

with ROBERT KENNEDY in Las Vegas and the "hit" on CASTRO

was called off. MAX was informed his services were no longer

needed.

In February or March, 1975, JOHN ROSELLI told

MAX that he and SAM GIANCANA were being investigated by the

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence concerning the

attempted assassination of CASTRO.

ROSELLI said GIANCANA

had agreed to testify, but he, ROSELLI, would not say

anything.

This conversation between ROSELLI and MAX took

place in Los Angeles.

In July, 1975, GIANCANA was killed with seven

•22 caliber bullets after two Chicago policemen on surveillance

were lured away.

GIANCANA was killed in his basement.

MAX

felt this was not a "mob" hit because the "mob" does not use

•22 pistols, they do not kill a person at home, and they

do not use automatic weapons because it leaves

the shell

casings.

Two weeks later, ROSELLI told MAX that he had

checked in Chicago and GIANCANA's murder was not a "mob

hit". ROSELLI told him it was a murder by the CIA to insure

, that GIANCANA would say nothing to the Senate Committee

concerning the involvement of the CIA with the "mob".

ROSELLI further indicated to MAX he felt he would be forced

to testify before the Senate Committee and would probably

be "knocked down" or killed because of it.

In the summer of 1976, ROSELLI went to Florida

to see his sister at which time

he was murdered.

It is conjectured by MAX that ROSELLI's murder was

done by the CIA to keep him from testifying before the Senate

Committee.

Present during this interview was Sergeant CARL OLSON,

Seattle Police Department, Seattle, Washington.
