•HERNAN RICARDO LOZANO FIRST BECAME KNOWN TO LEGAT IN APPROXIMATELY

JUNE, 1974, WHEN HE CONTACTED LEGAT FOR ASSISTANCE IN EXPEDITING THE

FROCESSING OF A VISA TO THE U.S. THAT HAD BEEN REQUESTED FOR THE MINOR

SON OF THE THEN DIRECIOR OF DISIP, DR. PEDRO ARTURO TORRES AGUDO.

LEGAT WAS LED TO BELIEVE RICARDO WAS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF DISIP AND

ASSISTANCE WAS PROVIDED THAT RESULTED IN THE PROMPT ISSUANCE OF A

VISA TO THE TORRES AGUDO CHILDE

RICARDO RECONTACTED LEGAT A FEW WEEKS LATER TO EXPRESS HIS

APPRECIATION FOR ASSISTANCE PREVIOUSLY RENDERED, AND LEGAT THEN BE- .

CAME AWARE RICARDO WAS MERELY AN AUXILIARY MEMBER OF DISIP, AND THAT

HE WAS ACTUALLY IN THE PERSONAL SERVICE OF LUIS POSADA• RICARDO RE-

VEALED HE WAS ALSO A NEWSPAPER REPORTER AND PHOTOGRAPHER AFFILIATED

WITH THE MAGAZINE "VISION," AND INDIÇATED HE DEVOTED MOST OF HIS TIME

RESEARCHING NEWS ARTICLES INTENDED TO DISCREDIT THE CASTRO GOVERN-

MENT. HE CLAIMED PARTIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE THAT

APPEARED IN A CARACAS NEWSPAPER ABOUT THAT TIME, REVEAL ING THE

FRESENCE OF CUBAN INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS IN CUBAN EMBASSY IN CARACAS. (E

DAT A •ON MEMBERS

ESTHE CUBAN EMBASSY WHICH WERE OBVIOUSLY OBTAINED

FROM DISIP FILES.

DURING ONE VISIT, RICARDO SUGGESTED LEGAT MIGHT

WISH TO MAKE SOME

SUGGEST IONS REGARDING COURSES OF ACTION THAT MIGHT

BE TAKEN AGAINST THE CUBAN EMBASSY IN CARACAS BY AN ANTI-CASTRO GROUP

OF WHICH HE FORMED PART. LEGAT INFORMED RICARDO SUCH WAS NOT PART

OF THE FUNCI ION OF THE LEGAL ATTACHE'S OFFICE, AND THAT IN ANY EVENT,

LEGAT PERSONALLY ABHORRED TERRORIST ACTIVITIES REGARDLESS OF WHOM

THEY MIGHT BE DIRECTED AGAINST. LEGAT POINTED OUT TO RICARDO THAT

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WAS DOING EVERYTHING IT COULD TO PREVENT DISRUP -

TIVE AND TERRORIST ACTIONS BY ANT I-CASTRO GROUPS IN THE US. RICARDO

DID NOT AGAIN REPEAT THE SUGGEST ION

LEGAT WAS SURPRISED BY APPEARANCE OF RICARDO AT AMERICAN EMBASSY

ON SEPTEMBER 30, 1976 THE LAST CONIACT WITH RICARDO HAD BEEN EARLY

IN DECEMBER, 1975, WHEN RICARDO TELEPHONED LEGAT AND INVITED HIM TO

A LUNCH OF VENEZUELAN SPECIALTIES PREPARED DURING THE HOLID

SEASON.

LEGAT DECLINED INVITATION, CITING A PREVIOUS ENGAGEMENT.

ON SEPTEMBER 3D, 1976, RICARDO INFORMED LEGAT HE HAD A PHOTO-

GRAPHIC ASSIGNMENI FOR "VISION" MAGAZINE IN JAMAICA AND WAS IN NEED

OF A VISA TO THE US SINCE HE PLANNED A TWO-DAY STOPOVER IN PUERTO RICO.

CONSUL HE HAD NO REASON TO BELIEVE RICARDO WOULD NOT RETURN TO CARACAS.

THE VICE CONSUL INDICATED IN THAT CASE A VISA WOULD BE ISSUED TO

RICARDO, AND HE WAS ASKED TO RETURN TO THE CONSULAR SECTION. UPON

TAKING LEAVE OF LEGAT, RICARDO INDICATED HE MIGHT ALSO VISIT NEW

TION WITH HIS PICTORIAL ASSIGNMENT FOR "VISION." RICARDO WAS NOT

SEEN AFTER THAT•

IN A CONVERSATION WITH AN OFFICIAL OF DISIPION OCTOBER 1, 1976,

LEGAT BROACHED THE SUBJECT OF RICARDO AND OF THE FAINT SUSPICION THAT

RICARDO MAY HAVE BEEN SOMEHOW INVOLVED. IN THE BOMBING OF THE GUYANESE

CONSULATE IN PORT-OF-SPAIN. LEGAT ADMITTED THERE WAS NO SUBSTANIIVE

EVIDENCE OF RICARDO'S IMPLICATION,BUT THAT THE COINCIDENCE OF HIS

PRESENCE THERE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME, COUPLED WITH HIS EMPLOYMENT

RELATIONSHIP WITH LUIS POSADA, HAD GIVEN LEGAT CAUSE TO WONDER.

THE DISIP OFFICIAL RELATED DISIP HAD NO REASON TO BELIEVE RICARDO WAS

THE CALIBER OF INDIVIDUAL THAI WOULD BE UTILIZED IN SUCH AN OPERATION,

AND THAT RICARDO WAS NOT KNOW TO BE INVOLVED IN SUCH ACTIVITIES, IN

SPITE OF HIS ASSOCIATION WITH POSADAY(5)
