Re Baltimore letter, 7/18/58, re arrangements for interview

of Baltimore PCI MAX GOLDBERG, CPA.

On 8/21/58, MAX GOLDBERG (conceal identity), was interviewed

at his residence, 3701 Clarinth Road, Baltimore, Maryland,

by SA(A) PAUL A. TURNER, at which time Mr. GOLDBERG advised

as follows:

After Mr. GOLDBERG became a CPA in the State of Maryland in

1932, he decided to engage in public practice of accounting

full time professional basis. At that time, the

economic situation in the country was poor and he found it

difficult to make a living.

In about 1937, he developed

Mr. ROY MC GINNIS as a client.

MC GINNIS

operated a

music machine distributing business, and is currently in

the coin machine business under the name of Roy McGinnis

Corporation, Maryland Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland.

In about 1940, Mr. MC GINNIS took Mr. GOLDBERG to Pittsburgh,

where he introduced him to SAM MANNARINO and his associates

who were in the same type of business. At the request of

SAM MANNARINO and some of his associates, he took them on

as clients and performed auditing and tax return services

Through MANNARINO he became associated with

SABESTIAN JOHN LAROCCA, MIKE GENOVESE and ANTHONY RIPEPI.

He also became acquainted with CHARLES J. MARGIOTTI, then

Attorney and political power in Pennsylvania who is now

deceased. Through MARGIOTTI he took over the accounting for

the Filben Corporation of Chicago, which was organized to

manufacture coin operated music machines. Although this

company has been defunct for a long time, Mr. GOLDBErG made.

other contacts which resulted

in developing clients.

example, in Baltimore he acquired the account of the Cee Gee

Music Company, which was organized by JOSEPH GIGLIOTTI and

LOUIS COMI

When the Filben Company ran into financial

difficulties, it resulted in an investigation by the Internal

Revenue Service,

and a great deal of newspaper publicity was

given to alleged irregularities in the operation of this

business.

Mr. GOLDBERG had been placed in a compromising

position

by officials of this company and realized at that

time that he had been taken advantage of by MARGIOTTI and his

associates.

He also realized that these men were engaging in

questionable activities and felt that if he continued his

association with them it could jeopardize his standing as an

accountant.

In about 1950, he decided in discontinue his relationship

with MARGIOTTI and his associates.

He wrote registered letters

to MARGIOTTI, GENOVESE, RIPEPI and others, advising them he

would no longer handle

their accounting.

At that time he would

have discontinued his association with LAROCCA, except for the

fact that he was then doing accounting for LAROCCA in connection

with some litigation involving most of LAROCCA's financial

interests. LABOCCA asked him to continue doing his accounting

work at least until litigation was completed.

Actually,

this situation has continued and LAROCCA has become further

Indebted to him, so that at present, LAROCCA owes him a

considerable amount of money for accounting fees.

In the past several years, LAROCCA has entertained Mr.

GOLDBERG at his residence for dinner and to meet his family.

Therefore, in the latter part of 1957, when visiting with

LAROCCA, Mr. GOLDBERG invited him to attend the wedding of

his son,

which was to be held at Philadelphia.

In February,

1958, the wedding was held and LACCA appeared accompanied

by ANTHONY RIPEPI. At this time, LAROCCA stated that his

wife was ill and could not accompany him.

Mr. GOLDBERG at

that time did not know that LACCA was wanted by the Govern-

ment or that there was any Federal

Grand Jury Proceeding in

which LACCA was involved.

He recalled that when he last visited with LARCCA prior

to the wedding, LAROCCA was having some trouble with his

throat, but at the wedding he did not notice any trouble in

this regard.

Mr. GOLDBERG emphatically stated that he has had no contäct

with LARDCCA since the wedding in February, 1958. He

assured that if he has

any contact with LAROCCA in the

future

he will contact the FBI on a confidential basis.

He stated

that he has every intention of cooperating fully with the

Government concerning LACCA and concerning any matter in

which the Government may have an interest.

Mr. GOLDBERG stated that handling the accounting for coin

machine operators and others close to this type of business

has been a very small part of his accounting practice.

stated that he still has some clients in this type of busi-

ness, but to his knowledge none of them are numbers operators

or are engaged in illegal activities.

He stated that he continues to represent ROY MC GINNIS, but

has no other similar type of account in Baltimore.

In the State of Maryland he handles the accounts of Andrews

Vending Company, Glen Burnie, Maryland, which is operated

by ALBERT KULLEN and THOMAS ANDREWS.

This company operates

various types of coin machines in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.

He also represents, in an accounting capacity, the General

Amusement Company, which is operated by c. W. HeNDRICKS,

colonial Beach, Virginia, which also operates coin machines.

Both of these companies operate in counties where certain

forms of gambling are permitted through use of coin machines.

Concerning LOUIS COMI, who is currently one of the top

hoodlums in the Baltimore Division, Mr. GOLDBERG stated that

he has had very little contact with COMI personally.

advised that ROSE COMI handled most of the dealings

for Cee

Gee Machine Company, which has been inactive for about five

years.

Mr. GOLDBERG recalled meeting JOSEPH GIGLIOTTI, who has been

identified as a former Pittsburgh racketeer currently operating

a night club in Dundalk, Maryland.

In the course of this interview, Mr. GOLDBERG requested that

his identity be concealed in reporting any information

furnished by him. He assured of his desire to cooperate

fully with the FBI in any investigation where he could be of

assistance.

Although Mr. GOLDBERG has furnished no information of

particular importance,

It is believed that recontact is

justified in an effort to further develop the friendly

attitude which he displayed when currently interviewed.

It

is believed that Mr. GOLDBERG would furnish specific informa-

tion on any matter if requested by this Bureau.

It is

contemplated that he will be recontacted in the near future

in an effort to

develop hiin further as a PCI.

The Pittsburgh Division will be advised of any subsequent

information furnished by Mr. GOLDBERG concerning LAROCCA

or GENOVESE or any of the individuals in which the Pittsburgh

Office has an interest; however, since no further investiga-

tion is outstanding in

this office concerning the captioned

cases, these cases are hereby being considered RUC.
