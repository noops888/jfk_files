Confidential Informant T-1, a confidential source abroad,

vised that the subject, a United States citizen, born on July 19, 1928,

at Glen Cove, New York, and holding Passport number 664545, issued at

Washington, D. Co, on May 24, 1953, took steps in London to

obtain a visa

to visit the Soviet Union.

According to I-1, subject described herself as

RELEAS

A FULL

PRELAT: IN PART

TODAA DENIALL

T-l said it was not known to him whether subject's efforts to

obtain a Russian Visa were successful.

The records of the Passport Section, American Embassy, London,

indicate that on September 28, 1955, subject requested her passport be

validated for travel to Russia. During her interview,

subject stated she

received a B.A. Degree at Bryn Mawr in 1950, and an M.A. at Harvard in

1953. She claimed to have done research for Senator JOHN F. KENNEDY of

Massachusetts; had worked for the "Current Digest of the Soviet Press,"

405 West 117th Street, New York City, from the spring of 1953 to the

fall of 1954; and was in the Research Department of "Colliers Magazine"

in the spring of 1955. She claimed membership in the World Student

Federalists, whose purpose, according to her,

was to expand and strengthen

the United Nations, and ultimately, to form a World Government.

On September 27, 1955, subject wrote to the Embassy to say that,

as a Student of Soviet Law, her purposes in applying for a Soviet Visa

were to talk with legal experts, to attend court cases, and to visit classes

at Moscow University.

She further stated that

hoped to cover a story, previously unreported in the West, and also trace

the case histories of

one or more of the soldiers formerly stationed in

Austria who were then being demobilized.

She identified her newspaper out-

let as the North American Newspaper Alliance, 229 West 43rd Street, New

York City.

On October 21, 1955, the Department of State authorized the

Embassy to validate subject's passport for travel to Russia providing

Soviet permission to enter that country was granted.

1955, subject presented a letter from the Russian Embassy, London, which

notified her that her visa to Russia had been received.
