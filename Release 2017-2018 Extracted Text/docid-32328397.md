activities in Mexico and with regard to his connections

with anti-CASTRO groups in the Miami area. Later on the

same date ROJAS telephonically contacted the Miami Office

and stated that he would appear at the office in a few

During the course of interview ROJAS appeared to

seemingly to the best of his ability, but gave the

impression of being somewhat unnerved by his recent experiences.
