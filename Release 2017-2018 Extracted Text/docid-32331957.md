On 3/16/59, Mx. JOHN KERNAN, PCI, Manager, Sea Gull.

Hotel, Miami Beach, Fla, advised that he is personally

acquainted with SAMMY MANNARINO of New Kensington, Pa.;; that

MANNARINO has in the past been a frequent guest of the Sea

Gull and that MANNARINO usually registers under a fictitious

name. He recalled that in the fall or early winter of 1958,

MANNARINO was a guest at the Sea Gull while using the name

Of MANN. Mr. KERNAN said he himself did not register

MANNARINO, nor checked him out.

Mr. KERNAN produced his registration card file,

and departed on 11/7/58. The card reflected

that MANN came to the hotel off the street, apparently

without previous reservation. The registration card bore

a time stamp reflecting the actual time of arrival at the

hotel was 1:36 A.M., on 10/25/58, and that the actual time

of departure was 9:07 P.M., 11/7/58.

Mr. KERNAN, upon examining this card, stated that

although he felt reasonably certain that this was the

registration card of MANNARINO, he could not testify to this

effect as he was not present at the time this party checked

in and checked out.

The card bore the initials of JAMES T. VERBY,

Night Auditor, as the clerk who checked MANN in.

Mr. KERNAN, after examining the registration card,

said that the party was checked out by WERNER MITCHELL, who

is no longer employed by the Sea Gull Hotel. He said that

MITCHELL was married to a daughter of BEN CHASIN, President

of the Sea Gull Hotel, has since separated from this woman,

and now reportedly lives in Chicago.

On 3/27/59, Mr. VERBY, upon examining the above

described registration card, was unable to recall MANN

as an individual, nor identify him as being SAMMY MANNARINO,

although he stated he can identify the registration card which

bears his initials. YERBY explained that as Night Auditor

DWYER. He was shown a photographic copy of the registration

Sea Gull Hotel, Miami Beach, by SAL MANN. He was asked

if helew if MANNARIND had been registered at the Sea Gull

under this name during the period 10/24 • 11/7/58.

PESSOLANO replied that he had discussed with

AUSA TEILLBAUM, Pittsburgh, his acquaintance with MANNARINO

and that he himself considered any contacts he has had with

MANNARINO to be privilegedbecause of their doctor-patient

relationship and that he did not want to discuss MANNARINO.

He was then asked if the telephone call that MANNARINO

had made to him several days after apprehension of STUART

SUTOR, for the purpose of inquiring if SUTOR would talk,

came within this privileged doctor-patient category.

PESSOLANO remarked that there was some question about
