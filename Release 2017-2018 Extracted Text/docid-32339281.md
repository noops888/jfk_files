SUBJECT: Negro Militant Activities on West Coast

*

1. The following information was acquired by Source from Dan Watt:

editor of the New York-based AÎXo-American militant magazine Liberator

2. San Francisco is one of the few cities in the United States whe

the SNCC leadership is fully integrated, i.e., including both Caucasians

and Negroes at the effective leadership Level.

3. In this area SNCC is concentrating on developing a draft resistance

campaign,, with large demonstrations planned on this theme late this month

(September 1967). Because the draft draws in larger measure on Negro

inductees (Watts said most white draftees are usually more easily able to

secure deferments on the basis of continuing their education), the

campaign

will be primarily targettod at the black communities.

A center of black militant activities in San Francisco is the

More Store, 1413 Philmore Street, and an individual particularly active

there is Bill Grey (or Gray). A Black Panther center of activities is at

953 Dehar Street.

•5. Activities in San Francisco are not generally geared toward civil

violence, but are more intellectual in nature, and seem to be concentrated

on seeking assistance from Holland and Sweden in arranging for "escape

routes" for draft dodgers and/or deserters. Assurances have already

apparently been received that such individuals would be accepted into France,

provided that they commit the "crime" of desertion in another country; they

would thus merely be seeking "asylum" in France.

6.. SNCC is presently negotiating with the lanzanians for the

establishment of an office in Dar-es-Salaam, which would be recognized by

the OAU (Organization of African Unity) Liberation Committee (i.e.,

would recognize SNCC on the same basis as other African revolutionary

"liberation" groups).

Regarding Bureau airtel dated 9/13/67. U

On September 14, 1967, CG 6547-5 furnished a letter

from RICHARD GIBSON received through

the

•AIC Post Office

Box in Chicago. The letter reads

Dear Comrades,

This note is being written urgently from Brussels

to inform you

that I will be shortly visiting the States

again

and would like to see you on some matters of urgency.

I deeply regret that none of you were able to stop

in London when you visited this part of the world.

In

any case, I believe that a discussion at this moment would

be extremely useful in view of coming events.

I expect to be in New York on the 14th and 15th of

this month.

A message can reach me, c/o General Delivery,

GPO, New York, N. Y.

10001 or C/O LIBERATOR, 244 East 46th

Street, New York, N.Y. 10017.

Just when I will reach

Chicago, I cannot say,

but expect thatwill be in the

two weeks afterwards.

Would you please let me know how

to contact you when I do get to Chicago, as we have no

phone number or other rapid contact for you.

Fraternally yours,

SECIAL

It is obvious that GIBSON has discussed the AHC

with RENE RAINDORE and/or JACQUES GRIPPA of the Belgian Communist

Party (BCD) and it appears that he has a message for the AHC

from the Belgians.

It would seem likely that the Belgians

have disclosed the identities of CG 6547-S and CG 5908-5 to

GIBSON even though he states he has no phone number for the

Committee.

Therefore the following letter was sent to GIBSON,

c/o General Delivery, GPO, New York City on 9/14/67, in order

to effectuate meeting with CG 6547-S:

Sept. 14th

Dear Comrade,

I received your letter of the 1lth-Call me at 752-3638;

if I don't answer give your number to my answering

service and I

will reach

(To be signed with the first name

and initial of CG 6547-5)

The Bureau will be advised by the most expeditious

means the results of the meeting with GIBSON.

THE NICOSIA DECUARATION

We, the undersignod Rivolutionary Organisations, hereby declare for

the peoples of Africa and Asia to know that the arch collaborator of U.S.

imperialism, the soviet revisionists, are frantically engaged in manocuv-

res: to destroy the rovolutionary unity of the peoplos of Africa and Aeia.

This unity, so vital to our interests, is boing duliberately undorminod

at the Sovict-sponsored"Afro-Asian Peoples Solidarity, Organisation Council"

mecting prisently being hold in the Amorican-owned Hilton Hotel ir Nicosia,

Cyprus. The mecting, as depicted by the course of ovints, was spucifically

called to attack the genuine anti-imperialist organisations from Africa and

Asia. The acceptance of noo-colonialist agunts from singapore, soviet

lackoys fron Coyion and carofully chosen individuals from othor countriva

testifies to the fact that this mooting was called for roasons othor than

to consolidate Afro-Asian Solidarity. The farce of this neiting was thorou

ghly exposed when individuals collocted fron the Ginza wore describud as

reprosentatives of the couragcous people of Japan. The Soviet revisionists,

from

fa European country (a statonent no politician can rush to deny), are now

playing the same despicablo role the Unitod Statco is playing in the Unitua

Nations.. The U.S, controls the Unitod Nations and stands at the door, like

St. Fever, and arbitrarily decidus who should unter and who should not, and

the soviot revisionists have adopted the same despicablo role in the Afro-

Asian Movemonts.

The 4th Conference of the Afro-Asian Peoples Solidarity Organisation,

hold at Wincha, Ghana, adopted unanimous r solutions concerning the

strengthoning of the AAPSO and its rovolutionary task. The Wirneba Cor-

fcrince unanimously agreed that the next counci: mouting

- bo hold in

Tanzania and the 5th Confurince in Poking. The Soviet revisionists, using

their bankrupt lackoys, stcadily manoeuvred to undermine tho docisionof

the poople of Asia and Africa. Fully cognizant of thu fact

that no sulf-

rospicting African of Asian country would pormit then to fulfill their

pro-imperialist activities, tho Soviet ruvisionists highhandedly deciaca

to corivenc this Council nooting in Nicosia undor thu protection of Unitca

Nations Iroops... With a biasce Chairman, who constantly warnod aclegatos

to accopt soviet domination or else ho would call in the polico, all

opinions unaccoptable to the organising clique

were forcibly stifled.

Ercodom of expression, a cardinal prineiplo in Afro-Asian dolibirations,

was blatantly donird to delegates in an imporialist fashion.

Thus not

only was the convoning of the mooting illogal, but unconstitutional pro-

coduros wore invokud to carry out their vile machinatipomarIon contaIned

Soviot Intrigue.

cision of the Winnoba Conforonce by show of hands. The highhanded "ox-

pulsion" of the South Wost Africa National Union was not only unconstitu

tional, but in dirict conflict with the spirit of the historic Winnobar

Confurence. The Winneba Conferonce, pursuing gonuine solidarity, advocat

rd tho accoptance of more than one organisation from still-depondont

states. Tho Ad-Hoc Committoc of the AAPSO, mooting to discuss the merber-

ship of organisations, recommonded the following with rogard to south west

Africa

•.¿ tho Commission rucommondo tho admission of SWAPO, with the rc-

quost to both organisations, SWANU aid SWAFO, to constitute a National

Committoo resulting fron the unvisaged front. Wild waiting for the

constitution of the front, both organisations vill be ripresonted toguthor

Instoad of pursuing the spirit of solidarity laid down in the com

mission's Report, tho Sovict rivisionists, omploying their rouble-paid.

voting cattle, committed the most sorious crime of splitting the solidarity

of the proplo of south vost Africa and thorofor the people of Africa ana

Asia.. This unconstitutional and undonocratic procodura holps to servo

only tho imporialists.

According

to the-biasca Chairman, the voting with r gard to tho "oz.

pulsion" Of SWANU was 25 in

favour and nonc against. Of these 25, we would

like to place on ricord that thoy reprosented only 10 mombor organisations

out of the reportod 60 nonbor aclegations prusont. The 25 votos included

six from the Sovict Union and four from the chief Sovist lackoy, tho

African National Congrras of south strica, the enjority of the mombors,

disgusted with thr unconstitutional procedure adopted to victimise a nombor

for frocly exprussing its Party's policios, couroctly decidra not to partin

cipato in this illegal act.

Thi victimisation of SWANU is a cloar indication of tho role of tho

- Sovict Union in splitting the solidarity of the pooplo of Africa and Asia.

WE WARN.

We, the undersignca ruvolutionary organisationa, representing tho popu-

lar movoments from Southorn Africa, warn in uniquivocabio terms all

splittors of Afro-Asian Solidarity that their fate will bo the same
