Lucien Conein

Attached hereto is dispatch number WFP-A-2933 which

gives data available on subject in the police files of the City

of Lyon in France.

Inasmuch as the acts mentioned in this dispatch took

whom place during the German occupation of France,

the fact that sub-

From

di he ptial?

ject has a police record is more to his credit than his discredit.

It is felt that these documents should be made a perma-

nent part of subject's security file since the reference police

record might in an unrelated context be taken as derogatory.
