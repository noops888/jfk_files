Subject was never irvolved in any dissideni activities in the

Soviet Union.

Se had no interest in uterground literature (samizuat)

and aster read any, nor dia she ever reca fussiar-language cocx:

published abroad.

It is unlikely Subject would have read such rateria

or participated in dissident activities even had she had the chance to do

so, as Subject and her husbard disdained the efforts of the Soviet

dissidents as foolish and pointless.

Subject herself has only a secondary

siucation and limited mentality. She is not interested in idsological

matters and is ar apolitical person.

It is highly doubtful Subject

read much of anything, forbiden or otherwise.

5. INFORVATICY CONCERVING SOVTET PATIONLISM PROSIES:

None. Subject has difficulty differentiating between the

various minority rationalities of the Soviet Union and tends to lump

certain of then together under convenient generic terms, such as

"Siriytsy' (Syriars) for Soviets of Turkic or other loslen nationality

Subject hai no interest in the plight of rirority rationalities

in the LSSR.

She recognized it was her Jewish ancestry which helped

her to cigrate legally from the USSR, but that is as far as it went.

6. CCINENT CONCERNING FOREIGE RADIO BROADCASIS TO THE SOVIET UNION:

Not covered in this debriefing. Subject rever mentioned listening

to foreign radio, even in passimo.

activities in the Soviet Union, but she was well chare of her husband':
