The originals removed from these files and replaced with

duplicate copies of the original were accessioned to the National

Archives and Records Administration (NARA) pursuant to the JFK

Records Collection Act of 1992.

Provision of the JFK Act allowed

for certain information to be postponed from public release until

the year 2017; therefore, the pages have NOT necessarily been

released for public review in their entirety.

Under the JFK Act, originals to all material deemed assassination

records must be accessioned to NARA regardless of whether the

material is open in full or released with information postponed.

Therefore, any documents or pages from FBI files accessioned to NARA
