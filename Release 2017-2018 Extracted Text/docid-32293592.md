ANTI-RACKETEERING

(00: Philadelphia)

Do QueAt

Re Bureau airtel to Philadelphia, 4/23/64, and

Philadelphia airtel to Bureau, 4/28/64.

PH 599-C-TE was contacted on 5/7/64. During the

interview, the discussion was led to the point that the subject

referred to in referenced airtels could be discussed

in an indirect manner.

It is pointed out that the informant

could not be questioned closely, as to do so might reveal the

Bureau's knowledge of any such plan and, further, the informant

claimed to his knowledge the individual who is identical with

the original informant in this matter has not been an acceptablel

member of the organization due to the type of criminal activity

in which he is frequently involved.

For this reason, any

to suspi questionine miht make that informant more susceptible.

In an effort to lead to the matter of current interest,

a discussion was had with the informant concerning the associa-

tion of FRANK NICOLETTI and ANGELO BRUNO since PHILIP TESTA

has been confined at the Philadelphia Detention Center.

The

informant said in his opinion, any

association between

NICOLETTI

and BRUNO was probably due only to NICOLETTI trying to

develop a closeness to BRUNO, and not due to BRUNO having any

more respect for NICOLETTI.
