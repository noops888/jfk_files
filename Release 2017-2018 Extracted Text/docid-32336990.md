"These men made a statement, declaring that their

cause is the liberty of Cuba, their politics,

liberty and loyalty only to the people of Cuba.

And these people ask only for help in order to keep

on fighting.

They do not make political propaganda,

and the truth is that they would exchange all the

politicians for a single rifle with which to fight

BATISTA.

"These are the men to watch and to whom one must

pay attention, because they have a burning desire for

liberty, for here the credo of all is Liberty or Death.

"I am an American and I am fighting here because

I believe in the cause which they defend and every day

I see them fighting and dying in order to maintain

their ideals. I am writing this so that the people

of my country may know the true history of the rebels

of the Escambray and so that they may notice that

only 90 miles from Miami, Florida, there are men who

are fighting against oppression in a form very similar

to that used by the founders of our country.

"WILLIAM ALEXANDER MORGAN"
