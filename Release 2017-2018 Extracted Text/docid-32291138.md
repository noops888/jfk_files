NK 92-1203

Investigations have been conducted in an attempt

to identify persons whose membership was stated or implied,

but whom sources referred to only by partial names or nich-

names.

Following

is a list of these names which could not

be identified on the basis of available information and whose

investigations are now closed until additional information

is received.

These names are being deleted from the list of

Cosa Nostra

• members in New Jersey.

NK 2327-C, the original source reporting this

individual to be a

member has since stated that the person

he had in mind was old when he knew him and is now probably

deceased.

Source could offer no additional information wich

would assist in identification.

(NU) NOVIA

92-1377

This person may be identical with PASQUALE NOVIA

who was born in Italy on 1/1/84. In 1953, he resided at

513 South 14th St., Newark, N.J. In 1962

he was reported to

be a member of the

Essex County Hunting and Fishing Club,

Newark.

This organization, a gatbering place for elderly

Italians, is operated by CARMINE BATTAGLIA who is reliably re-

ported to

• be a Cosa Nostra member.

Since NOVIA is 80 years

old and is not known to be engaged in criminal activities,

no additional investigation concerning him is contemplated.
