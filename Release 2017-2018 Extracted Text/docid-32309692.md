DATB: August 25, 1952

Rebulet August 14, 1952, by which a copy of a

memorandum from the Legal Attache at Havana,

Cuba, dated

July 25, 1952 was forwarded to Miami and Pittsburgh.

Mr -334 has previously furnished information that

DICK, REYNOLDS of Miami, Florida, has set up a corporation

known as the Inter-Amèricas Check Cashing Service, Inc., a

Florida Corporation which is to be used during the next winter

season by gambling houses in the Havana, Cuba area.

REYNOLDS was recently contacted by an Agent of this

office and stated that he set up the above corporation in

partnership with DAVE WALTERS, a former Immigration and Naturaliza-Bo

tion Service employee now practicing law in Miami, Florida.

REYNOLDS said that he and members of his family are the officers

of the corporation.

He advised that the operation of his check cashing

in

service is presently limited to the Sans Souci Club, near

Havana, but that he hopes to be connected with all gambling

casinos in Cuba when the next season begins.

After an individual has lost money in the Sans Souci

and owes the house, the casino will refuse to cash his check

but will refer him to the Inter-Americas Corporation, which will

cash a check for the amount owed by the loser, charging a fee

of 2% of the amount of the check.

In the event the losing

gambler who makes out the check stops payment, a civil suit to

recover will be filed at Havana, Cuba by Inter-America, which

REYNOLDS stated is a bona fide American corporation doing

business in Cuba.

The corporation is to receive one-third of

all sums

collected on defaulted checks.

• REYNOLDS is already acting as a collector for the

operators of the Sans Souei,

although the set-up is not completely

organized in Cuba. He explained that one NAT is to handle the

checking service at the Sans Souch but furnished no further
