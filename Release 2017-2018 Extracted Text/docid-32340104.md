ITAR. - GAMBLING; CHS - GAMBLING

For the information of Miami, TP 156-C-TE advised that

while shacking up with a prostitute she claimed to have been

approached by an individual to prostitute herself aboard a

ship, which was located about 13 miles outside of Cocoa Beach,

Florida.

The informant was led to believe that aboard this

ship, was a place where ambling took place and also prostitution.

The informant later obtained a card on Cocoa Beach, Florida

which indicated that one could obtain dining and dancing aboard

the luxurious 164 foot ship "Estuary Queen" and the host, MIKE

* CVEREKO, telephone # 784-0555.

The informat further advised that according to the

information he picked up this boat comes into the Cocoa Beach

area once or twice per month, no specific dates supplied.

A review of the 1967-68 Criss Cross Telephone Directory

determined that telephone # 784-0555 is subscribed to by the

ABC Answering Service.

Efforts to identify the Estuary Queen have been negative

to date although it has been determined

that a similar type

operation was done with a vessel known as the Orange Sun which

was based in Miami several years ago. However this vessel is

165 feet in length

and reportedly is in the Jacksonville area

at the present time. Reportedly HARRY COHEN and MIKE, MCLANEY,

Pinetree Drive, Miami Beach, Florida had the gambling action

on the Orange Sun.

In addition it was reported that HARRY COHEN /

MIKE MCLANEY and SY MANDELL went-to a reputable attorney in the

Miami, Florida area in the past several months and inquired as

to how to run an operation similar to that which was on the

Orange Sun several years ago.

These individuals imired how

to operate this gambling ship in a legal fashion and the attorney

whose identity is unknown, took offenseeat the inquiry and

threw the above persons out of the office
