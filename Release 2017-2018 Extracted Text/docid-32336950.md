some members of "drill" (directoire iberique de liberation, or,

Iberian Directorate of Liberation) and promised them the assis-

tance of

commandos, trained in Cuba, for the "liberation"

A schen was then conceived whose first step sani

sisted of taking possession of the Portuguese steamer

embark its passengers in Cuba and embark the commandos
