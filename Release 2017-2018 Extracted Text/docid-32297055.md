DIRECTOR, FBI (92-3267)

LOS

SAC,

JOHN ROSELLI, aka

ANGEIES (92-113C) (P)

GEORGE HOPKINS, Manager, Glen Towers Apartments,

advised that he did not observe ROSSELLI around the apartment

from about last Sunday until the morning of February 12, 1965.

He said, however,

that on February 10, 1965, he observed

ROSSELLI's car in the

garage for the first time since last

Sunday.

He also observed a girl around the apartment since

Wednesday and he believes, but does not know for certain,

that she has been staying in an apartment on the same floor

as ROSSELLI's apartment.

On February 12, 1965, HOPKINS

examined a photograph of KATHY HORDEN and

stated that she is

the girl he has seen around the apartment.

It would appear

that HORDEN is probably again living

ROSSELLI.

The Las Vegas Office received information from

IV 10-C that on January 30, 1965, a Miss CHRISTEY attemptea

to contact ROSSELLI at the Desert Inn Hotel and left her

telephone number as 736-3161. As previously reported

ROSSELLI left Las Vegas for Los Angeles on February 1, 1965:

Office also advised that information

was received

the Nevada Gaming Control Board that

ROSSELLI was in Reno, Nevada, on February 9, 1905, in the

company of MAURICE FRIEDMAN,

and that the purpose

of their

presence there was not known.
