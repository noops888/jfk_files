CANTEs are not involved in any gambling in the Tampa area.

Source noted that years ago, when SANTO TRAFFICANTE,

SR.

was alive and operated in Tampa, there were open gamoris?

houses and

source worked a dice

table for the old man.

there was a great

oal of bolita played in those days,

but the situation nas changed drastically since then,

asd

Chess

just is not enough potential business in the area for

this

family to

take a great interest in

Source noted that

whatever the TRAFFICANTEs' interest may be, it was desintely

outside of the Tampa area, possibly

Central Florida,

around Miami, but from source's knowledge,

the family is not

operating any gambling operations in the Tampa area at adi.

TP T-3 pointed out that SANTO TRAFFICANTE, SR., de.

ceased, and all his sons have been known to source for the

past 40 years, and recalled the oldest son, FRANCISCO, always

wanted an education, but he had Lallen out of school and so

did the other sons drop out.:

Source said SANTO has personally

source on numerous occasions that he and FrANk always

fought and never did get along.

Source

pointed out SANTO

never around Tampa

anymore, and was in the opinion he was in

Miami, where there are some 200,000 Cuban refugees, some of

whom SANTO undoubtedly knows from the Havana, Cuba

Source noted SANTO does

not have any piece of any bolita

operation known to source, pointing out SALVATORE "TOTO"

TRAFFICANTE, does not have any numbers bank to source's

knowledge, and in fact, TOTO has been around Tampa,

borrow

ing money Source pointed out FANO TRAFFICANTE was never

involved in any numbers racket and he,

FAND, nor the oldest

brothers

FRANk,

were considered in the TrafFIcaNte group.

TP T-3 further advised on November 4, 1964, that

even

JAMES C. LOnGo was borrowing money from source, and

many other people, who

has to pay his medical bill in

Boston, Mass•

Source stated it

was

not queried of his

friend, JAMES C. LONGO, why he did not merely get the money

from his close friend, SANTO TRAFFICANTE, and therefore, 1t

was assumed the TRAFFICANTEs were

not flush

with

money.

GENERAL ACTIVITTES

TP T-4 advised on November 12,

1964,

that the subjoct

does

not spend

much time in Tama, but nost o1 his
