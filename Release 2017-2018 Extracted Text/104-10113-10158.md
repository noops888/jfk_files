I. ANTI-CASTRO ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES

Efforts of Cuban exiles based in the United States since

the fall of Batista and the assumption of power by the Castro

regime on l January 1959 have been characterized by continu-

ally shifting alliances aimed at securing for their leaders

a paramount position in any successor government in their

homeland.

Programs have been enunciated by individual leaders,

organization lists drawn up, and funds solicited.

Consider-

able propaganda has been published, and leaflets attacking

Castro have been dropped over Cuba

periodically. Some mili-

tary and paramilitary training has been undertaken, particularly

in the Dominican Republic where a force ranging from a claimed

80 men to several thousand has been training for the past

nine months. Some exiles claim to have armed followers in

Cuba as well as a larger number of sympathizers. There has

been one abortive invasion attempt.

These efforts have been weakened, however, by rivalries

between

the more prominent exiles for leadership ot any for-

mal anti-Castro movement established, and their tailure to

agree on any progran.

Their activities also have been affected

by the fact that

most of the exiles were connected either

actively or passively with the Batista regime.

They recognize,

although they do not always admit this, that Batista's rule

is still too unpopular with the mass of Cubans

for them to

engage in a successful effort to overthrow Castro unless they

are supported by a force far

larger than any can command.at

present.

These rivalries plus Castro's followers' long training

in revolutionary methods appear to have enabled Castro to

learn the plans of most of the alliances formed thus far well

before they are put into action.

Nevertheless there has been, and continues to be, a general

recognition by most of the more

prominent

exiles that they

must unite if they are to succeed in removing the present re-

gime.

The most important potential leaders of any such move-

ment

to emerge so far are listed below under separate headings.

A. General Jose Eleuterio PEDRAZA Y Cabrera

When mention is made of military measures

to eliminate

the Castro regime attention inevitably focuses on General

Jose Eleuterio PEDRAZA Y Cabrera.

While opinions differ

as to his suitability for the role of leader of a military

attack on the Castro forces, he is regarded by the most

prominent and most active exile leaders in the United States

as the only military leader in a position to take effective

action in the field against Castro.

The forces at his disposal in the Dominican Republic,

the loyalties he can command within Cuba, and the help he

can

get from exiles in the United States

have been variously

estimated from a mere handful to several thousand. He,

himself, has stated in a memorandum to a prominent American

businessman that he hoped he could count on a force of 2,000,

led by 100 former Officers and Non-Commissioned officers_ of

The remainder of his force would be made up

of Spaniards, Yugoslavs, Germans, and perhaps a

few Dominicans. (1)

PEDRAZA has expressed his willingness to work with General

Martin DIAZ Tamayo and Colonel Ramon BARQUIN and would wel-

come their cooperation but he has never hinted that he would

turn over leadership of his forces to either.

Former Castro supporter Francisco RODRIGUEZ Couceiro,

who claims to have been one of the prime organizers of two

anti-Castro groupings The Anti-Communist Crusade (CRAC) and

Christian Democratic Action (ADC) has backed PEDRAZA as

the military leader of

against Fidel Castro. (2 hy expedition which should be launched

Rodriguez clains to have visited the

General late in October 1959 and to have reached an agreement

whereby Pedraza committed himself to clean up his force of

men in the Dominican Republic and put them under the direc-

tion and control ot the AdL.

Rodriguez asserts that the

agreement provides for the elimination of all but Cuban

nationals from the forces in the Dominican Republic under

Pedraza.

Fabio FREYRE, a wealthy young Cuban--who also claims

to be the founder of the ADC--has made known his connections

with Pedraza and claims to have drawn up points of agreement

with him. (3)

Freyre has

stated that General PEDRAZA is the

He adds that Pedraza was not closely identified with Batista's

coming to power but when the Dictator needed help Pedraza

was made head of the army.

FREYRE believes that the Cubans

DI. Emilio NUNEZ Portuondo, now resident in Washington,

J.C., and one of the more prominent

anti-Castro exiles, has

consistently tried to align the various anti-Castro elements

in the United States, Mexico, and Cuba behind General Pedraza. (>)

Carlos MARQUEL Sterling, who at the moment appears to be

Pedraza's choice for provisional president,

if efforts to

unseat Castro succeed has

supported the military role of the

General. (6)

General Pedraza's service under Fulgencio Batista has

left a bad taste in the mouths of many Cubans who hated the

Batista dictatorship as vehemently as they now detest the

Castro regime.

There seems to be reasonable doubt that Dr.

CUERVO-RUBIO, whom RODRIGUEZ Couceiro has claimed CRAC sup-

ports as a

presidential candidate, would support Pedraza.

CUERVO-Rubio is reported to have stated that responsible

opposition to Castro inside Cuba would be reluctant to asso-

ciate with Pedraza and might join in the fight against him

should he attempt an invasion.

Some of these people have

repeatedly expressed the fear that Castro might use such

an invasion as a pretext to suppress all opposition. (')

Prom-

inent Orthodox Party leader Antonio VARONA also

is reported

to be worried

by Pedraza,

that he and his followers would join with the Castro brothers

in repelling any invasion led by Pedraza. (8) It is considered

a distinct possibility that a Pedraza led invasion would play

into Castro's hands, leaving internal opposition no alterna-

tive but to invasion. 19, in a national effort to repel a

It is known that FREYRE'S ADC which supports Pedraza

support of the former Chief of the Revolutionary Air Force

Emilio NUNEZ Portuondo

NUNEZ Portuonde, now residing in Washington, D.l., was

one of the first to declare his candidacy

for the leadership

of an anti-Castro movement.

A former politician,

lawyer

and diplomat Nunez was Cuba's delegate to the United Nation:

from 1952 until 1958.

During this period he cooperated with

the US delegation and was outspokenly critical of the USSR.

Most Cubans in the United States, and in those Latin American

countries where he and his followers have solicited support

for their anti-Castro activities are under the impression that

he has

some type of commitment with the US Government. Al-

though he continues to be mentioned, along with Carlos

MARQUEZ Sterling, as the most likely candidate for provisional

president of

a successor government to lastro, some source.

have alleged that he would not make an effective president.(1)

Nunez' announced aim is the overthrow of the Castro re-

gime and its replacement by a civil government friendly to

the US and excluding individuals associated with Batista.

To this end he and his immediate followers have published a

newsletter and

periodically dropped leaflets over Cuba at-

tacking Castro.

C. Carlos MARQUEZ Sterling

Carlos MARQUEZ Sterling comes from a family with a dis-

tinguished record in Cuban History.

He was born in 1899 in

Camaguay and received his education in Cuba, graduating

from the University of Havana with a law degree in 1920.

Three years later he became a professor at the University.

It was from the same Univeristy that he was removed in 1959

by Castro forces.

MARQUEZ Sterling told American officials

that Fidel Castro had been one of his students at the Univer-

sity of Havana 1945-1947, and that Fidel had been reared

in an atmosphere of hatred for the United States.

His political career began while he was still in his

teens and he was arrested and imprisoned for his activities

in the revolution of 1917. During the thirties he lived in

Washington while his father was Ambassador.

Later he re-

entered politics and became Speaker of the House of Repre-

sentatives.

He had a hand in the establishment of the

Ortodoxo Party in 1946.

Previously Marquez had presided

over the drafting of the Constitution of 1940.

A former

Presidential candidate and a leader of the Partido del Pueblo

Libre (PPL) which he

established in July 1957, Marquez Sterling

appears to enjoy the respect, 1f

not necessarily the tuli

confidence, of many leading Cuban exiles in the United States. (1)

Major DIAZ-Lanz has gained considerable publicity for his

break with Castro, his appearance before the Eastland Com-

mittee and his spectacular leaflet dropping over Havana on

21 October 1959. His brother Marcos, Who was Inspector General

of the Revolutionary Air Force (FAR) joined him in Miami in

July and the two were until December closely associated with

Ricardo LORIE Valls, a former underground leader of the

26 July Movement.

These three and a few other associates

member of the group, for reasons which are not al all clear. (2)

The small group about Diaz-Lanz in conversation with U.s.

officials and private citizens

has steadfastly refused to

have anything to do with former Batista officials while they

have stated their intentign to take any measures to insure

the downtall of Castro.

of Investigations until the fall of Batista.

In the United

his loyalty to Batista.

He has been associated for a time

former Cuban Consul General in Miami in the Anti-Communist

League, which has made two attempts to fly arms to Pinar

Rio, Cuba. In each

case

men connected with the actual

flying of arms were arrested by U.S. officials.

he is not at all happy about the location of Pedraza'

He considers Pedraza a prisoner of Trujillo Oef-

in September 1959 Jose SUAREZ Nunez, a Cuban exile arrived

in Miami to deliver instructions from Batista to Piedra to

attempt to immediately consolidate the anti-Castro forces

into a viable movement to overthrow the Castro government.

Batista reminded Piedra that there should be no involvement

with the Dominican Government and advised him that to the

greatest extent possible groups should be cultivated which

are now or might be expeffed to be looked upon with favor

by the U.S. Government.

Enrique FERNANDEZ Parajon, former

Chief of

the Secret Police under Batista was reported in

January 1960 as endeavoring to merge a group under the

leadership of Orlando PIEDRA with the ADC. He added that

the PIEDRA group has three planes which they would like to

use during the next 60 days to set fire to sugar cane

fields by dropping incendiaries.

However, FERNANDEZ bemoaned

the fact that tight United States controls in Florida were

hampering their activities.

Fernandez said that he is in

contact with Guatemalans and Nicaraguans and that he and

Piedra are responsible for military operations.

It was his

opinion that Pedraza has only 80 men in the Dominican Republic. (4)

NASFERRER realized that this was a means of increasing bis

prestige with Americans he became a friend of the US.

J. Penetration of the Anti-Castro Movement

Castro has bragged that his capture in Cuba last August

of an arms-laden plane containing a group of anti-Castro

militants was due to his having planted a spy in their midst. (1)

Earlier the Chief Investigator of Cuban Army Intelligence

(Departamento de Investigaciones del Rjeroito Revolucionario

- DIER) had admitted to the FBI that the Castro regine

sent a man to Miami with the express purpose of reporting or

the activities of anti-castro exiles.

country. (5)
