Information furnished by FINEGAN to the Senate

Subcommittee concerning other aspects of Cuban revolu-

tionary activities appears to be based on general public

source information.

Concerning VINCENT HANARD's Freedom Fighters of

the Americas - Neutrality Matter,"' the Bureau is referred

to the report of SA GEORGE E. DAVIS, JR., at Miami,

August 21, 1961.

Concerning FRANK ANTHONY STURGIS, aka. (BuFile

2-1499), the Bureau is referred to the report of SA

LEMAN L. STAFFORD, JR., Miami, August 17, 1961.

CERALD PATRICK HEMMING, head of Interpen fM 639-5/C)

and, the Miami Office consider FINEGAN unreliable. It is

doubtful FINEGAN has any significant information concern-

ing Interpen or Cuban revolutionary activities in view of

the short period of time he was involved in Cuban matters,

and it is doubtful he would cooperate on interview.

Inasmuch as FINEGAN is hostile to the Bureau, ob-

viously mis-informed, and his present whereabouts unknown,

UACB, Miami anticipates no further contact with FINEGAN.
