The language harrier between student and instructor retarded

the student's progress to some extent.

His navigation, flight plan-

ning and weight and balance work is limited.

It, is recommended that

he have access to a helicopter each day In order to buildup his time.

SEORS

Iden B received training which exposed him to all aspecte

of Bell 47G3Bl helicopter flight and support requirements.

b.

The flight fantliarization included almost all of the.

normal helicopter marcuvers along with radio procedures.

total flight tige amounted to 5+30 hours.

Both instructor pilots

noted that his flying procedures were rough, but were improving

steadily.

He did not solo inasmuch as both pilots indicated that

he was not. ready for solo.

c.

Iden B wash given approximately 9 hours orientation in

helicopter maintenance and from 3-4 hours of orientation with re

gard to

.,

the contents of the support kits and accessory equipment.

Complete assessment of this individual is difficult to

make, as he was only in the training area for a short period of

time.

Horever, the following information may be helpful in making

an evaluation:

flying proficiency in 47G3B1 is below par at this time.

He requires more dual and emergency procedures.

His conversation and experience indicates that he is

more Knowledgeable of Hughes equipment than he is of Bell

equipment:

Iden B appears to be a very extroverted type of in

dividual.

In any conversation lie does most of the talking.

The instructor pilots felt that his knowledge of hel

Icopters Icaned to the "manual" side rather than the practical

side.

He seemed, according to tie instzuctor pilot, to have

a "shallow" knowledge of helicopter operations.

The case officer for the WITHRUSIl pilot training was Alfred F.

PELANDER. Instructor pilots were Iden il and Alexander V. DECLIPPIE.
