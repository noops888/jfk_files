WASHINGTON

SEPTEMBER 14, 1961

DEAR DR. MIRO CARDONA:

I WRITE TO EXPRESS MY CONFIDENCE IN YOUR LEADERSHIP OF THE

CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL. THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

DEEPLY ADMIRES THE DISTINGUISHED SERVICE YOU HAVE ALREADY RENDERED

TO THE CAUSE OF A FREE CUBA; AND I HOPE YOU WILL CONTINUE

TO LEAD THIS FIGHT UNTIL YOUR COUNTRY IS LIBERATED FROM THE TYRANNY

WHICH HAS BEEN IMPOSED ON IT. I AM SURE THAT ANY PROBLEMS ARISING

FROM YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES CAN BE WORKED

OUT IN THE SPIRIT OF MUTUAL COOPERATION AND COMMON ASPIRATIONS

WHICH LIE BEHIND ALL OUR EFFORTS.

SINCERELY,

IS/ JOHN F. KENNEDY

CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL

TEXT OF U.S. POLICY STATEMENT READ TO DR. MIRO BY MR. HURWITCH

OCTOBER 31, 1961

THE PURPOSE OF THIS MEETING WITH YOU, DR.MIRO, IS TO CLEAR UP

SOME APPARENT MISUNDERSTANDINGS THAT APPEAR TO HAVE CREPT IN

WHAT HAD BEEN CONCEIVED OF AS THE BASIS FOR A SOUND AND AMICABLE

WORKING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

THE UNLIED STATES AND THE CUBAN

REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL.

THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WISHES TO REITERATE ITS COMPLETE

CONFIDENCE IN YOU AND ITS DEEP ADMIRATION FOR THE DISTINGUISHED

SERVICE YOU HAVE ALREADY RENDERED TO THE CAUSE OF A FREE CUBA. THE

U. So GOVERNMENT HOPES THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO LEAD THIS FIGHT

UNTIL YOUR COUNTRY IS LIVERATED FROM THE TYRANNY WHICH HAS BEEN

IMPOSED ON IT.

THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WISHES TO EXPRESS ITS CONFIDENCE

IN YOUR LEADERSHIP OF THE CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, AND REGARDS

THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL AS THE CENTRAL POINT OF CONTACT IN ITS

DEALING WITH THE CUBAN EXILES AND UNDERGROUND ACTIVITY. IN SUPPORT OF

LEADER AND UNIFYING FORCE OF THE CUBAN EXILE COMMUNITY. AS AN

IMMEDIATE STEP IN THIS DIRECTION THE U.S. WILL ARRANGE THAT EXILE

GROUPS OTHER THAN THE COUNCIL NOW DIRECTLY SUPPORTED BY THE U.S. WILL

IMMEDIATELY RECEIVE THIS SAME ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE REVOLUTIONARY

COUNCIL. AS DR. MIRO IS AWARE, THERE ALWAYS EXISTS THE REMOTE

POSSIBILITY THAT NOW CUBAN EXILE GROUPS MAY FORM IN THE FUTURE

AND MAY, IN THE U.S. VIEW, MERIT DIRECT SUPPORT IF SUCH EXILE

GROUPS ARE- UNWILLING TO WORK WITH THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL.

SUCH EXILE GROUPS WOULD ONLY RECEIVE SUCH DIRECT SUPPORI FROM

THE U.S. ONLY AFTER THOROUGH CONSULTATION WITH DR. MIRO AND THE

COUNCIL WILL BE KEPT FULLY INFORMED OF SUCH A GROUP'S ACTIVITIES.

WITH RESPECT TO CLANDESTINE ACTIVITIES, THE U.S. WISHES TO

REITERATE ITS DESIRE TO RESERVE ITS RIGHT TO DEAL DIRECTLY WITH

THOSE UNDERGROUND GROUPS WHICH HAVE INDICATED THEIR UNWILLINGNESS

TO WORK WITH THE COUNCIL IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR UNDERGROUND

ACTIVITIES. "ALL GROUPS WILLING TO WORK WITH THE COUNCIL IN CONNECTION

WITH THEIR UNDERGROUND ACTIVITIES WILL BE DEALT WITH THROUGH DR. MIRO.

THIS MEANS THAT THE OPERATING U.S. AGENCY WILL MEET JOINTLY

WITH DR. MIRO AND WITH THE APPROPRIATE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE

OFFICIAL USE ONLY

THE STATEMENT WHICH THE DEPARTMENT MADE ON APRIL 9 SAID,

IN PART, THAI WE SHARED WITH DR. MIRO CARDONA, "THE AIM OF

RESTORING FREEDOM TO THE CUBAN PEOPLE."

THAT CONTINUES TO BE THE AIM AND PURPOSE OF THE U.S., LET

THERE BE NO DOUBT ON THAI CENTRAL POINT.

NOW, A STATEMENT HAS BEEN PUBLISHED WHICH PURPORTS TO

BE THE REASONS GIVEN BY DR. MIRO CARDONA FOR HIS "IRREVOCABLE

DECISION" TO RESIGN AS CHAIRMAN OF THE CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY

COUNCIL.

THE STATEMENT SEEKS TO DISCREDIT SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS IN

THE GOVERNMENT AND TO QUESTION THE GOOD FAITH AND INTEGRITY OF

THEM, AS INDIVIDUALS, AND OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENI IN DEALING WITH

THE

CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL. WHILE APPRECIATING THE URGENT

DESIRE OF THE CUBAN EXILES TO RETURN TO A FREE AND INDEPENDENT

CUBA AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE DATE -- A DESIRE WHICH IS FULLY

SHARED BY THE PEOPLE AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES --

THE DEPARTMENT CONSIDERS THIS RECKLESS STATEMENT A GROSS

DISTORTION OF RECENT HISTORY AND OF THIS GOVERNMENT'S POLICY

WITH RESPECT TO THE ELIMINATION OF CASTRO-COMMUNISM FROM THIS

HEMISPHERE.

THE DEPARTMENT WILL WISH TO CONTINUE CONSULIING WITH LEADERS

OF THE CUBAN EXILE COMMUNITY CONCERNING SUITABLE METHODS FOR

ACHIEVING OUR COMMON OBJECTIVES. HOWEVER, THE POLICIES OF

THE GOVERNMENT IN THE FIELD OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS WILL CONTINUE

TO BE DETERMINED ON THE BASIS OF THE BROAD NATIONAL INTEREST.
