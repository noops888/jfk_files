On November 3, 1960, IGNACIO ROBERTO NOVO SAMPOL,

the Secretary General of CNA,

advised SA VINCENT J. WARGER

that the last meeting

he had attended pertaining to anti-

CASTRO activities was a meeting which took place in New

York City at the residence of a member of the Frente Revolu-

cionario Democratico (FRD), a unity of several anti-CASTRO

organizations which has become quite prominent in the anti-

CASTRO movement.

This meeting occurred during the week of

October 28, 1960. As a result of this meeting, NOVO advised

the CNA had decided not to join with FRD and was thinking

of siding with the Alíanza de Liberacion (AL), a unity of

several anti CASTRO organizations, which will be further

described below.

Novo stated that during the week prior to

that time, FELIPE,

RIVERO DIAZ met with PEDRO DIAZ LANZ and

one Captain CHINEA who, according to NOVO, was a representa-

tive of the anti-CASTRO group headed by LUIS CONTE AGUERO.

NOVO stated FELIPE RIVERO was to notify him in about two

weeks of his decision with regard to joining with the AL.

NOVO stated he knew nothing of the plans regarding the AL

to date.
