CONFIDENTIAL.

RE: INSTITUTO CUBANO DE LA DEMOCRACIA

MM T-1 advised that on November 14, 1964, Col-

onel Valdivia left Miami without notifying individuals

with whom he was in close contact.

He arrived back in

Miami from New York on November 24, 1964.

Upon his re

turn, he immediately contacted Dr. Sanchez, inasmuch as

Sanchez was

to

introduce him to some individual of i

portance.

Early in December, 1964, Colonel Valdivia

informed MM T-1 that he had had no further contact with

his superior in Haitian matters; and that he had nothing

to suggest to further the Haitian movement. It appeared

to source that Colonel Valdivia had changed after his

trip to New York. He also changed, possibly,

because he

had been interviewed by U. S. Customs Service and U. S.

Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) at Miami.

MM T-1, at that time, did not expect any new activity on

the part of ICD, or individually on the part of Dr. San-

of the recent developments.

On December 6, 1964, Dr. Sanchez informed MM T-1

he had no new information concerning the Haitian affair.

Dr. Sanchez mentioned that efforts were being made to ob

tain some help from possible sources, but no specific

mention was made as to any possible source. & (U

MM T-1, on December 23, 1964, advised

that he

knew of no activity on the part of Dr..

Sanchez, Colonel

Valdivia, Antonio Paz, or Jose Antonio Maceo.

Maceo, the source stated that no mention has

been made

of him since the original discussions were held with Dr
