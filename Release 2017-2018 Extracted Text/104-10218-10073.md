LIFEAT of 9 February 1967 reports that Soviet Press

Attache Nikoiay Sergeyevich LEONOV (201-122139)

asked the

printer of the Soviet Information Bulletin in ¡exico, Jose

HERNANDEZ, Azorin, to make up

"the same list we did for Chile,

but for the Colombian addresses."

Azorin said that he would have

the list ready in ten days and send it (to loscow).

2.

The above probably means that the nines and addresses

of Chilean subscribers

to the Bullctin printed in lexico were

sent to Chile when the Soviets started their nuw magazine there.

It thus appears that the sovicts may now be about to put out

a magarine in Colonbia and that the Colombian addrosses on file

in Mexico will similarly be sent to Colombia.
