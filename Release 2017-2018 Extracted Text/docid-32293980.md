NIED BERGMAN and told him of a tentativé

ne Ad hoc Committee For A Marxist Leninist Party, USA (AHC) @)

which planned to feature FRANK as a speaker. BERGMAN approved

DI SUSAN as a speaker, however, he "heard"

she was connected

100-426439, NY 100-130565, BERGMAN's wife and sister-in-law

respectively,

fails to disclose any indication that either

one of them were acquainted with SUSAN prior to GARVIN's

garrival in the US from China in October, 1970.

The possibility

Sexists however, that both GARVIN and QUANDER during the 40's

and 50's, at least knew SUSAN FRANK by name, since all of them

were CP functionaries in the NYC area. GARVIN and QUANDER

were active in the CP Negro and labor circles and FRANK at one

time was

• of the Farm Research, Inc.

(FR), 120 Liberty

ACC 6547s was told by BERGMAN to send personal

correspondence to FR, indicating that this was a cover post

office

NY 594-s has reported in the past that he learned

FR was an office for pro-Peking Communists.

RICHARD CYRIL FRANK is the subject of a pending

IS-CH case, Bu 100-401762, NY 100-107383, 00:NY. He is the

nusband of SUE FRANK and

is employed as a free lance Assistant

Director, Director's Guild of America, 59 East 34th Street,

NYC.

The offices of FR have been utilized since 1966 on

a regular basis by CHARLES and ROSE COE, as well as RICHARD

FRANK.

In view of the above, it would appear that the

BERGMAN's have now been accepted into the close relationship

that previously existed between the COE'S and the FRANKS.

ReNYlet reports negative contacts with established

Chinese sources to determine likelihood. of USCPFA being an

RU front organization.

Investigation is continuing regarding this organization

and

as soon as any further evidence is

received that it is an

RU front, the Bureau and the San Francisco Division will be

promptly advised.
