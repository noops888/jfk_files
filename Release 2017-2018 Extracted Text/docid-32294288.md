when bridged across the subscriber's telephone line.

The special/SPMT device using the electronic switching technique (U)

measures 1 1/2' by 7/16" by 1/2". It is complete with a microphone,

preamplifier and the electronic switch/and can be connected directly across the

subscriber's telephone line without atecting his telephone service.

It is noted that there is some concern on the part of the telephone company

as to what effect the installation of equipment across the telephone line would have

on the ringing of the subscriber's telephone instrument. While the Laboratory has

no facilities to check the effect on ringing in a system using the frequencies set

forth in your letter of 10-30-61, it is felt that the impedance of the unit is

sufficiently high that ringing will not be affected.

In order that the Laboratory may have a complete diagrammatic layout of

the subjects' services, it is desired that you submit cable prints of the feeder and

distribution cables in the areas in close proximity to the subjects' residences as

well as the area you propose for a monitoring site or sites. You should ascertain

from sources in the General Telephone Company of Florida, the identity of a

normally closed ringing relay that will respond to the ringing frequencies of the

lines involved and advise the Bureau the source of the relays. In addition, you

should ascertain the ringing voltage, talk voltage and operate current for subjects'

telephone service.

You will note that emphasis has been placed on the use of the telephone.

instrument for disguise. You may determine, after a súrvey, that you have a

telephone service outlet which will afford better microphone coverage than the

telephone instrument. If such is the case, the electronic switching device can be

bridged across the line at the outlet or at any place where security and time permit

_concealing the microphone, electronic switch and its associated wires and connect-

ing same to the subject's telephone line.":

In the event you are able, through telephone company cooperation or

otherwise, to/ubstitute a telephone instrument which has been altered to incorporate

the new electronic switching equipment for one now in service/in subjects'

NOTE: the use of/RFMT type of coverage, but Laboratory tests indicate that telephone

sets used for subjects cannot be activated by RFMTunit. Tampa next considered Mu

SPMT typé of installation. Laboratory questioned effect of such a low value of jumper

resistor, required for this type of installation, would have on ringing of telephones in

the area.

The Laboratory has now developed an electronic switch circuit which

should not affect ringing of telephones in the area. For details of electronic switch

circuit see memorandum R. L. Millen to Mr. Conrad/captioned "SPMT - Electronic

Switching Circuit, "' 11-27-614

The telephone instruments previously submitted to the Laboratory will be

retained in the Laboratory pending a decision by you concerning the possibility of

altering the sets for instant operation.

In the event

your survey indicates that a MISUF can be securely installed,

you should submit a request for installation authority.
