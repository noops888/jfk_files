developed, which was the CPA policy prior to the change

in line.

Subject elected member of Executive Council

of Hollywood Independent Citizens' Committee of the Arts

Sciences and Professions (formerly the Hollywood Demo-

cratio Committee). He attempted to organize an FDR

Caravan for this Committee, which was to tour the

western states

in an attempt to put pressure on Presi-

dent Iruman and the State Department to return to the

policies of the late President Roosevelt. Subject

tational New Masses benefit at the home of FRANK TUTTLE

He had an argument with RICHARD BRANSTEN,

with aliases, over BRANSTEN's discussion of Duclos article

at non-CPA meeting and threatened to have BRANSTEN ex-

pelled.

Conmunication from BRANSTEN to LAWSON reflects

LAWSON's leadership in

the

Honywood CPA movement. Bank

to an alleged Communist dominated organization of Connunists.
