"Disregarding the petitions of the Cuban people,

Government unless you suspend all commerce with the Cuban

Communists regime. If you do not do this, you will be

the one responsible for the Mexican ships and planes that

will be dynamited. To avoid further mishaps, don't

make the mistake of under estimating this advice from

Cuban power.

Signed ERNESTO
