MARTIN KATZ, aka

ITSP

Miami File 87-17771

Bufile 87-71448

The installation in the HYMAN MARTIN case, mentioned

above, consists of a 42A MATE.

This MATE is currently in-

operative and efforts to remove and replace this 42A MATE to

date have been unsuccessful.

It is felt that the security of

this installation has not been jeopardized by the fact that

42A MATES in Las Vegas may have been compromised. At such

time as this source is replaced, efforts will be made to in-

stitute some other type of coverage.

With regard to installations in the offices of

BENJAMIN SIGELBAUM and ALVIN 1. MALNIK, in each case a 44A

MATE has been used. Consistent with full security, immediate

steps have and are being taken to remove these 44A

• MATES since

it is felt their security definitely has been jeopardized.

Efforts will be made to afford another form of

coverage,

particularly in the case of BENJAMIN SIGELBAUM.

MARTIN KATZ is a bail bondsman and close associate

of top jewel thieves in the Miami area. He has an office in

downtown Miami in an old building. A 42A MATE has been used.

It is not known that KATZ is in any way connected with the

Las Vegas group as are SIGELBAUM and MALNIK, and for this reason

the security at this time is unimpaired. It is anticipated,

however, that this coverage will be removed in the not too

distant future as the building wherein KATZ's office is located

is scheduled for demolition.

MM 92-515 Sub II

With regard to the installation at the apartment of

LOUIS SCHRAGER, this is a 42A MATE. It is not felt that

security of this installation has been jeopardized at this

time and in view of this it is recommended that this be left

in.

With regard to this installation, it is felt that it can

be removed on short notice.

In every case Miami will continue to be alert to

any factors which will alter the security of any of these

microphones and take appropriate

action.
