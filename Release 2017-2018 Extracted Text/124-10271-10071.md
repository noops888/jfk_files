This official advised

that Alvarado was being treated cordially and that he was either

telling the truth or was the world's best liar.

This official advised

that Alvarado's interrogation was continuing and that this interview

would now be conducted in a little stronger manner.

He furnished no

further elaboration on this statement but stated that Alvarado, who

is apparently familiar with the interior of the Cuban consulate, was

unable to pick out a photograph of sylvia Duran from a group of

photos

of remale individuals.

On the evening of 11/29/63, Legat, Mexico, received informa-

tion from a high-level Mexican official that Alvarado reportedly admittec

his story was a pure fabrication designed to provoke the U. S. into

kicking Castro out of Cuba.

pure fabrication for the above-mentioned reason. Scott advised that

and during the last few hours of Alvarado's interrogation vas in a room

adjoining that room in which Alvarado was being intervieved.

As a

activities and from 20 to.25% of the information furnished by Alvarado

was unreliable.

himself to be more intelligent than his control officer. Scott stated

no intormation was avallable that the Mexican authorities had used any

violence in securing an admission from Alvarado that his statements

were fabrication.

Canadian passport or the red-haired Cuban Negro.

Vice Consul Azcue reportedly returned to Cuban on 11/13/03.

authorities have been requested to assist in the possible identificatio

of the above-mentioned white male with Canadian passport and red-haired

Cuban Negro who allegedly witnessed the pay-off to Oswald. However, it

appears that Alvarado's descriptions of those persons who reportedly

witnessed the pay-off are intentionally vague,

thus making it impossible

to identify of interrogate them and leaving

Duran as the only logical

person available to confirm or refute Alvarado's statements.
