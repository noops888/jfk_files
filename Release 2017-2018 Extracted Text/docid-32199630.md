A report was received under reference 175A-DL-109 from the Office

of Legal Attache, US Embassy, London wherein it was requested that

further enquiries be made in the UK to assist a current investi-

gation by the FBI in Dallas. An anonymous telephone call had

been received in New Orleans relating to the marginally quoted

subject and previous UK enquiries had tentatively identified the

caller.

Initial enquiry showed_ Deborah MILLINGTON to be away from her

Brighton address on business. She eventually contacted me on

31 August 1989 and readily admitted telephoning Joseph GIARRUSO in

March 1989. During the conversation I was able to elicit the

following.

She

was previously married to an American

and between 1966 and 1969

she lived in the New Orleans area working as an assistant physio-

therapist

at the Touro Infirmary.

Through general conversation she

discovered that one of the patients was the wife of a New Orleans

attorney and that the law firm, for whatever reason, had a

secretarial problem. As she was

able to type she offered her

services

at weekends when necessary.

Having had no training

as a

legal secretary, much of what she typed meant nothing to her.

One letter did however, which was to the mother of Lee Harvey OSWALD.

After all this time she can only say that it related to money

being sent to her. (the mother) and it seemed to refer in some way

to President KENNEDY'S

assassination. She initially considered

informing the authorities but decided against it as she didn't

wish to bring herself to attention. She denied ever being

interviewed by the New Orleans Police Department during the Clay

SHAW trial. She was aware of the nature of this trial and was

aware of the name Clay SHAW within the attorneys office but she

cannot now remember in what context.

Why did Deborah MILLINGTON telephone New Orleans in March 1989? A

controversial documentary concerning the assassination of President

KENNEDY had been broadcast on British television in March 1989 which

caused her to remember the events of many years

ago.

She became so

incensed by the subsequent debate conducted in the media that she

decided

to telephone New Orleans to see if Joseph GIARRUSO was still

Chief of Police.

When in New Orleans she

had felt sorry for him over

the criticism he received

after Clay SHAW's acquittal.

She seeks no

publicity or further involvement.

In fact she was somewhat aghast

at me contacting her as her intention was to remain anonymous.

Enquiries of Sussex Police show that she lives in a good class area

of Brighton and nothing to her detriment could be found in local

records. At this stage there is nothing to indicate that the events

didn't happen.

It was, however, impossible to assess the true extent

of her knowledge. Should it be considered necessary I will attempt

to take

the matter further.

I ask that this report be forwarded to the Legal Attache, US Embassy,

London for his information.

This report is forwarded on the condition that neither it not irs

contents will be forwarded to any other individual or organisation

without the prior approval of the Commissioner of Police of the

Metropolis, New Scotland Yard, London, SW1.
