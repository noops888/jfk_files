MARKED FOR INDEXING

NO INDEXING REQUIREO

INDEXING CAN BE JUDGED

BY QUALIFIED HQ.

DESK ONLY

REFERENCE(S)

WIROGUE has received

political recognition from the West German

government and is fully

documented in

the name of Georg

Frank Sanders.

This was accomplished with the cooperation of ODIBEX on

the basis of

fabricated story stating that Subject is a Georgian who defected from

East Berlin on 14 July 1962 while with a tourist group. It was necessary

to acquire political recognition for Subject because this was the only

to backstop.him if and when he applies

for immigration to

South America.

A. Fremdenpass would not withstand the investigation

required by immigration authorities.

All/the South American Consulates in West Germany were contacted

assistance of CAMANTILLA in an

attempt to collect information

which would enable HARVARD to select the most likely country to which

Subject could immigrate based on his personal preference, opportunities for

emigrants, immigration requirements, etc. Columbia, Chile or Peru offer

the best possibility.

The next step will be for Subject to apply to the appropriate

Consulate and begin his processing.

Prior to having Subject

step HARVARD will require Headquarters guidance

and thinking regarding the

following:

a.

Subject as a prospective emigrant will have

to furnish

of employment or proof of financial solvency.

Subject's

West German documentation indicates that he is an engineer.

This does not mean that he is a diplomaed engineer but rather

a master mechanic.. This is borne out by the details of his

falsified life history and in fact by Subject's actual skills

in electrical and mechanical fields.

HARVARD feels

Subject can satisfy any. South American Consulate that he is

experienced enough in electrical and mechanical fields to be

of value to the economy of the South American country of his

Once Subject is admitted to South America, HARVARD

has no doubt that he can find employment if he desires it.

The ideal solution, however:

would be for Subject to have

firm offer of employment prior to his immigration.

can arrange this, HARVARD feels that Subject's immigration

could be practically assured.

Subject could seek employment

through the German language newspaper in Santiago, Chile but

HARVARD feels that

no South American firm would take the

chance of hiring him sight unseen unless he were a highly

qualified specialist.

b.

536

If proof of employment cannot be provided, proof of solvency

is the next requirement.

Only one of the

South American

countries has stated what it considers to be the minimum proof

of solvency.

The prospective emigrant must show that he has

the funds to subsist for two years at the rate of $125.00 per

HARVARD feels that to deposit $3,000 to Subject's

account would be a grave mistake.

HARVARD-Has no doobt thal

Subject is capable of taking the money and departing for parts

unless there were sufficient inducements awaiting him

HARVARD could probably arrange:

HARVARD has not considered processing Subject for immigration

organization a party

fe: the present wolid indicate

immigration avenue should not be considered except as a last resort.

d.

When filling out his application forms Subject will have to

provide employment and residence

addresses consistent with the dates when

he was supposedly living and working in the Georgian S.S.R. His wartime

military

service will have to be covered also.

HARVARD feels that this

information can be acquired through the facilities of SR/6 when needed.

HARVARD is of the opinion that Subject has committed himself to

going tọ South Arerica partly because he will do anything which will pro-

long his association with KUBARK and partly because he is hoping

realize some personal or financial profit from the exercise.

HARVARD has

followed the theme that Headquarters deisre is to help Subject and that it

can best be

done by. completely legalizing him.

Political recognition is

the first step but we desire further that he'be helped to immigrate and.

after 5 years acquire citizenship.... Subject has asked HARVARD if he would

receive financial help during the transition period in South America.

was told that we could only guarantee his plane

fare, that Headquarters

would decide how much and what kind of additional help he would receive

Subject rejects the idea of staying in Germany except as a last

possible that because of his irritation with his

inactivity

Subject may simply request his German documentation and leave HARVARD'S

6. WIROGUE Resettlement Considerations

AF/5 representative has requested comment from Undersigned

on NIROGUE's

apparent reluctance at resettlement attempts in Frankfurt

a/M which

are underweigh at the present time

I believe.

It is

indersigned's understanding that Subfected has threated to work for

the French Service if resettlement negotiations do not proceed to

subject's liking.

Speculation has been that this is probably a bargain-

ing

tactic to gouge an appreciable amount of additional dollars in his

resettlement claim.

Undersigned considers this a quite valid

assumption, and entirely

attributable to Subject.

Subject probably

views this

threat as particularly critical in view of the seeming

political/econonic conflect with the French,

and appeeciates br now

one of the differences between the AIS and the IS of a fascist and/or

totalitarian state.

It covers only that time sequenteduring which

Undersigned actively handled Subject.

At that time Undersigned was a junior C/O on the

AESENTINEL Project which was to

be prepared

and launched from the zI

Columbia.

This dispatch summarizes the WIROGUE case from May 1962 to March

1964.

2.

Subject arrived in Frankfurt/Main from the Congo on 22 May

1962. KUBARK's reasons for establishing contact were

dictated by

the need to relieve Subject of his KUBARK-supplied false Austrian

Subject appeared to be primarily a resettlement problem,

therefore, Orme K. DARONNAT was assigned

responsibility.

Since adequate documentation was

a primary consideration for

successful resettlement, Subject was briefed on the relative merits

of the types of FEDREP, documentation available. Although Headquarters

The WIROGUE case suffered a temporary setback when in December

1962 the BUNDESVERFASSUNGSSCHUTZ (BFV),

the West German organization

responsible for the internal security of the FEDREP became interested

in Subject and requested all available information.

HARVARD briefed

OCA Bonn that Subject was strictly a HARVARD agent resettlement case

whose name, lecognition interview story, etc were complete

fabrications to insure his receiving political recognition and a

Reiseausweis. OCA advised the BFV that Subject was of continuing AIS

interest and HARVARD resumed its resettlement efforts. 2- 233477

CONTINUATION OF

DISPATCH

S-E-C-R-E-T

EGO.3-21573

6.

By summer 1963 detailed

South American

immigration data

had been acquired.

This disclosed that Subject's language

deficiencies, background, knowledge of the Soviet Union, and work

history were insufficient to guarantee his smooth processing

through

the INTERGOVERNMENTAL COMMITTEE FOR EUROPEAN MIGRATION

(ICEM) Our investigation also pointed up the fact that until

Subject was provided with a detailed life history containing the

infornation required by prospective employers and/or immigration

authorities,

he was not

in a position to be resettled anywhere,

let alone South America.

As a result, HARVARD's plans

to process

• Subject for immigration

had to be cancelled, at least temporarily.

7.. A CABEZONE Stage I C.O, was given

the task of preparing a

story containing the factual information needed for the filling

out of job applications, to stand

up under detailed interviews and,

if South American inmigration ever took

place, to satisfy immigration

requirements.

This legend was given to ODIBEX Camp King representa-

tives who prepared a new political recognition

arranged for the removal of copies of the old story from the various

FEDREP files and replaced them with the new.

For the first time since Subject had arrived in HARVARD's

custody the way was clear for a final resettlement.

Subject's

Reiseauswels was renewed

and he was quitclaimed and advised to

work and establish himself in Germany.

He was told that nothing

more could be done for him and that immigration to South America

at anytime in the future would be without KUBARK assistance.

HARVARD has done everything to insure Subject a successful

future :free

problems resulting from his

"black" association

Therefore, there is good reason to believe that

become involved with any of Subject's

future problems.

It is also unlikely he will attempt to coerce

KUBARK with threats to reveal all.

With his criminal background

he is aware that he can be brought to the attention of the French

authorities.

He also believes that KUBARK's position in the FEDREP

is such that

we have nothing to fear from any action on his part.

At the time of this writing Subject has a position as

research

and development engineer with a Munich firm.

Ile allegedly

receives DM 1500 per month, has an expense account and is to receive

a percentage of all

profits realized from the sale of any devices

he develops.

to move to Munich permanently about the

end of May or June 1964:

HARVARD has arranged

with CSB Data Processing Branch to

publish a noforn drop notice under Subject's documented name so

that any attempt to immigrate to any country will bring him to the

attention of KUBAFK and appropriate action can be taken.

12.

It is suggested that Headquarters arrange to apprise

HARVARD of any

inquiries

regarding

Subject under lis documented

name or any of the names listed in

the problen of VIROGUE which is now being clarified.

References represent an initial misunderatanding of /

The problen of backstopping of resettlement and

disposal cases his been carefully

reviewed by elements of CSB

concerned including CABEYONE; UKTOPAZ. and CATIINS.: In this

connection there is attacked a copy of a monorancin dated 27

August 1963 from Chief/uKTOPAY-which outlines the current

situation.

As will be noted IRTOPAZ has and will expand its

capability for procurement of operational docurents independent

of the

513th ICG.

It is believed that the present procedures

for backstopping of resettlesent and disposal cases should be

continued.

In theory an independent capability is desirable

but not really prectical at this tine.

Creation of an

independent capability for backstopping resettlement cases

would require duplication of the procedures and practices now

folloyed by lit. Tillmy of

the S13ta ICG.

In addition, we would

not have the advantage of hiding our cages from the Germans among

other Army disposal cases.

Furthernore, USAREUR has requested

notification prior to contact with any German officials of any

sensitive cases which we may desiré to handle without military

assistance--see USAREUR letters dated 7 August 1961 and 23 March

1902, attached.

#ith considerable effort it would be possible

to backstop some of our resettlenent and disposal cascs directly

with Gernan officials.

It would be quiet difficult,

however, to

prevent the

Army fron learning of such action which

is contrary

to the USAREUR request.

It is possible that the PEDREP will enact new

legislation on the control of non-Gernan refugees.

Likewise,

nOw FEDRED energency laws may affect this type of case.

keep this situation under

reviey and in the event the circun-

stances change will Inittate appropriate action.

DS-981

DS-999

HARVARD has learned through

CIMANTILLA that Subject and wife

have returned to the U.S. where

both have found employment and are

now apartment hunting.

At Subject's request

HARVARD made

arrangements to obtain a duplicate

of the deregistration form

covering

Subject's move from Frankfurt to

Neuss in July 1962.

Subject and family are being assisted

1n obtalning West German citizenship.

DS-127

Subject's Communist Party membership

was

discussed informally but at some

length with the local ODURGE chief.

Since the latter believed that Subject's

membership would, according to the strict

interpretation of the law, be ruled

voluntary, processing for immigration to

the .U.S. under Public Law 110 has been

requested.

Resettled during

the reporting period.

Subject will not appear

on next month's or subsequent HARVARD reports unless and until

some new unforeseen aspect of the case arises requiring additional

HARVARD action.

In this event the case will be listed and the new

CAHAVOC - 1

Subject has begun to look for an apart-

ment on the local economy. In the mean-

time he will continue to occupy HARVARD

housing,

WIROGUE

Subject's legend is being rewritten

and when finished will provide the

• basis for a nore plausible political

recognition story.

HARVARD hopes that

with the substitution of the new story

for the old, positive steps can be taken

for Subiect's resettlement.

IDEN -264

The morale problem created by the slow

moving quota under which Subject is

registered for U.S, immigration has

required HARVARD to register her for

immigration under the Parolee Act.

It.

is expected that Subject will receive

her visa in August or September but the

Parolee Act will be used in the event the

quota continues to remain unchanged.
