JELSEN maintained that she had no further

contact since that time with her daughter. She stated she was

tired of the whole affair and would cooperate with the FBI in the

future.

Investigation by Bureau Agents at Marshall, Texas,

ascertained that the money order was sent from Dallas on 6/16/5

to JOYCE THOMPSON and was actually picked up on 6/17/59 by

THOMPSON. No address was given by the receiver and she obtained

it by identifying the color of her mother's hair, gray. Investiga-

tion is being conducted today at Marshall of all motels and

hotels in an effort to obtain further information concerning FRYE

and POPE.
