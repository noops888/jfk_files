will

be a mutt installed in a lamp operating at approximately

38.5 megacycles.

This lamp is part of the regular furniture

presently located in the motel office. After installation,

it will be returned to its original place in the office and

the installation will therefore constitute a trespass.

The

telephone instrument in the motel will not be utilized in any manner.

6.

Type of case involved:

PECORA is under development as a Top Echelon Criminal Informant,

having symbol number NO 1283-PC. In the past, he has also been

the subject of an AR case. He is a known assooiate of such well-

known hoodlums as JOSEPH

PORETTO, HENRY ERNST, and THOMAS

AMATO. In the late 1950's when the Federal Bureau of Narcotics

listed suspected Mafia members, PECORA was on this list. The

Tropical Tourist Court is a known hangout for hoodlums, such

as those mentioned above.

7 Connection or status of subject in the case:

PECORA is the principal subject in this case.

8. Specific information being sought:

It is felt this coverage may develop information as to the

existence of a La Cosa Nostra group in New Orleans. It is

also felt that this coverage will develop information as to

the identity of individuals contemplating major crimes in

the South Central States, as persons frequenting this motel

office are well-known major criminals.

9. Reasons for believing the specific information will be obtained by the

technical surveillance:

It is felt specifically that any conversations between JOSEPH

PORETTO and PECORA could very well be the link to determining

the identity of La Cosa Nostra members in the Greater New

Orleans area.

Both PORETTO and PECORA are well-known associates

of CARLOS MARCELLO, suspected head of any. "family" in New

Orleans.

10. Importance of case and subject:

This coverage will represent the first technical coverage in

the New Orleans Office of a suspected Mafia member and at

present there is no technical

coverage in existence that would

develop this type of information. To date, no information has

been developed through live informants concerning La Cosa

Nostra membership in the New Orleans or Louisiana area.

11.

Possibilities of obtaining desired information by other means

As noted previously, New Orleans has been unable to develop

information concerning the existence of La Cosa Nostra in New

Orleans or Louisiana through live informants.

In order to

develop PECORA into a top echelon criminal informant, it is

not felt at the present time that direct contact with him

would result in his providing any information concerning

La Cosa Nostra or information he might have concerning the

activities of the major criminals and hoodlums in the Louisiana

During previous contacts with PECORA, he has provided

no information of significance and in such instances has beer

uncooperative.

12. Risks. of detection involved:

The misur will be a radio operation with no wiring from the

building and

no contact with the telephone company necessary.

As the radio will be completely concealed within a lamp,

which is presently part of the office equipment at the motel,

it is felt that the risks

of detection with this type of

equipment are negligible.

13. Probable length of technical surveillance:

90 days

14. Request made for technical surveillance by any outside agency

(name specific official, title and agency) :

None
