Roa's evaluation of the situation in Cuba was highly pessimistic.

KIS

Roa stated that the situation has deteriorated; that this was the only thing

that could have happened because talks at the United Nations, New York,

did not find an answer to the problem. Roa also observed that conditions

as of February, 1963, were similar to those just before the crisis in the

Fall of 1962, mentioning pirate boat activities, a campaign in the United

States and a statement by President Kennedy which Roa described as

meaningless.

Roa commented that the United States was the only nation which

benefited from the crisis. The informant understood that it was Roa's

contention that by excluding the Security Council of the United Nations

from considering the Cuban situation and permitting the Organization of

American States (OAS) to take up the matter freely, the United States

is now enjoying a very favorable position in the OAS, the best it has enjoyed

at any time in the Organization. In still referring to what the informant

believed was the OAS, Roa said that the report of the Antisubversive

Committee, now under study by the OAS, contains some definite proposals,

such as a collective breakoft and a breakoff in relations with Cuba including

postal contacts. Roa said it is known officially that Mexico will accept

such resolutions with reservations; Bolivia, Chile and Uruguay will accept

everything; and it is believed that only Brazil will oppose such resolutions.

Cuba, according to Roa, believes that talks between President Kennedy and

President Romulo Betancourt, Venezuela, will establish the action by the

Roa also commented that it would have been much better it the

Cuban situation had been handled by the United Nations Security Council.

Among other things, this would have limited the ability of the CAS.

When it was suggested that time was working in Cuba's favor, Roa

agreed, saying it permitted internal consolidation, and economic and

organizational endeavors. He also mentioned the differences within

the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the hope for settlement of

differences in the Soviet Bloc and prospects for general relaxing of

strained relations between all countries.

Although Roa did not mention the Soviet Union at any time, it

appeared that he does not now agree with the Soviet Union's placing

missiles in Cuba In 1962. Roa's comments during the entire conversation

left one with the feeling that he was pessimistic, according to the informant.
