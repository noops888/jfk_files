ENCLOSURES:

TO THE BUREAU:

Original and one (1) copy of LHM characterizing

informants used in

a attached report.

ADMINISTRATIVE:

On 1/16/67, NO 1457-C-TE advised that on 1/13/67

TRAFFICANTE had been in telephonic contact with CARLOS

MARCELLO. MARCELLO apparently did not discuss any business

with TRAFFICANTE on the telephone, but had his brother,

JOSEPH MARCELLO, call a number back, presumably in Fla.,

and then discussed some unknown business with

TRAFFICANTE

On 1/30/67, NO 1457-C-TE advised that TRAFFICANTE,

accompanied by his wife, had arrived New Orleans sometime

before 5:00 PM on 1/27/67 and were currently staying in

Room 758, Fountainebleau Motel, New Orleans. He stated

that JOSEPH MARCELLO and his wife had taken the TRAFFICANTES

to dinner at the Emerald Door on Fri. night, 1/27/67, and.

that TRAFFICANTE himself had spent most of Saturday

at the CARLOS MARCELLO residence.

He remarked that

CARLOS MARCELLO'S Wife, JOSEPH MARCELLO's wife, and

TRAFFICANTE's wife, had spent the day shopping and that

later in the evening, CARLOS MARCELLO and his wife had

taken the TRAFFICANTEs to the La Louisiane Restaurant for

cAp the

dinner and had returned to the CARLOS MARCELLO residence.

around 11:00 P.M.

He remarked that on Sunday, 1/29/67, the two

MARCELLO brothers had entertained TRAFFICANTE at a private

dinner at Elmwood Plantation and the several other

individuals

who are not known at the time, had also been present.

He

remarked that TRAFFICANTE appeared to be unusually exuberant

on this particular visit, whereas MARCELLO appeared to be

upset and whether this is caused by MARCELLO's recent

health problems or TRAFFICANTE's visit, is not known.

TP 92-1

On 1/31/67, NO 1457-C-TE advised that on the morning

o1 1/30/67, TRAFFICANTE became very upset because he passed

some blood

and that CARLOS MARCELLO had made an appointment

foI TRAFFICANTE with a proctologist named Dr. HEBERT.

He remarked that later during the morning, CARLOS MARCELLO

made a local telephone call and informed the party with

whom he was conversing, that "the man" was there and wanted

to look at the plant.

He remarked that TRAFFICANTE apparently

told his wife that he was leaving to look at a building

and possibility exists that this was main purpose of

TRAFFICANTE's trip to New Orleans:

He remarked that TRAFFICANTE's wife does not plan

to accompany SANTO to New York where he is due to appear

on 2/16/67, as she feels such trip might seriously jeopardize

her insurance claim resulting from a recent accident.

During the evening

of 1/30/67, TRAFFICANTE indicated

to the MARCELLO brothers and their respective spouses,

that

he wanted them to be his guests in Miami sometime during

February when he intends to have a very private dinner party

fOr FRANK SINATRA.

On 2/1/67, NO 1457-C-TE related that TRAFFICANTE

and his wife had departed the New Orleans area during the

afternoon or evening of 1/31/67, and that prior to leaving,

TRAFFICANTE had picked up some X-rays to take with him.

Information from records of

the General Telephone

Co. of Fla, were made available on 1/19/67, by Mrs. SHIRLEY

NONNENBERG, Centralized Toll Investigations, and on 1/24/67

by MI. GENE MASON, Security Department.

Extended investigative period occasioned by

desire to include results of investigation conducted by

an auxiliary office, which was not available at time of

last report.

On 1/5/67, Det. Sgt. TREVOR LLOYD-HUGHES,

Criminal Intelligence Squad, New Scotland Yard, London,

England, advised that

he has been unable to locate any

record of TRAFFICANTE having visited United Kingdom within

the past three years.
