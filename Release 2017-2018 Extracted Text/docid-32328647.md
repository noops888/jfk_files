Enclosed are nine copies to the Bureaud a letterhead Jfk)

memorandum and an equal number of letterhead memoranda of

evaluation of the informant mentioned therein.

The information in the enclosed letterhead memorandum

was furnished by ALBERT OGDEN PIERROT, PSI, Export Sales

Representative of Bell Aircraft Corporation, Washington, D. C.,

to SAS DONALD HOETING

and JOSEPH E. SCULLY on 7/5/60. (Identity pro-

tected at his request.)

In addition to the information furnished in the

enclosed letterhead memorandum, PIERROT advised that for a

period of time following the overthrow of the BATISTA government

in Cuba, he was in close and frequent contact with PEDRO and

MARCOS DIAZ. LANZ. These contacts were for the purpose of

selling Bell helicopters to the CASTRO government.

On one

occasion, about two weeks prior to his defection, PEDRO DIAZ

LANZ approached PIERROT and advised him of his intention to

defect. On his return to the United States, PIERROT immediately

contacted CIA and advised them of the plans

of PEDRO DIAZ LANZ. .

That occasion was PIERROT'S last contact with PEDRO DIAZ LANZ

until that. contact mentioned in the enclosed letterhead

memorandum. On this occasion, when learning of PEDRO DIAZ

LANZ" financial plight, he felt that there was a possibility

that PEDRO DIAZ LANZ could ber of service to the United States

Government.

With this in mind, he attempted, through friends,

to place PEDRO DIAZ LANZ in contact with first, the State

Department, and later CIA. The individual he spoke to at

the State Department, one WILLIAM INTELAND, made a flat

refusal to see DIAZ LANZ. PIERROT's contact at CIA showed a

definite lack of interest in DIAZ LANZ.

PIERROT is unaware

of whether DIAZ LANZ was ultimately contacted by CIA on this

occasion.

Also, in regard to the financial needs of PEDRO

DIAZ LANZ, PIERROT noted that he has pointed out to his

superiors

their company's past profitable dealings with PEDRO

DIAZ LANZ in his former capacity as a representative of the

Cuban government. PIERROT recommended that PEDRO DIAZ LANZ

be given a job by the Bell Aircraft Corporation at a nominal

salary of about $300 a month, pointing out that the day could

conceivably arrive when Bell

Aircraft would again be dealing

with PEDRO DIAZ LANZ in the sale of their aircraft. PIERROT

advised, however, that he did not have much hope for the

adoption of his recommendation.

In regard to the 10-page document mentioned in

the enclosed letterhead memorandum, WFO will maintain both

it and the letter of MARCOS DIAZ LANZ in their files. If

Miami has not already received a copy, it is felt that that

office can secure a copy from PEDRO DIAZ LANZ.
