Howard

The attached October 30, 1996 letter to the Director

from the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB), advises of

determinations concerning JFK records. Upon receipt of this

letter, a seven day period for appeal to the President exists.

The ARRB made decisions on 90 documents, which the John

F. Kennedy Task Force is currently reviewing for appeal issues.

The Office of Public and Congressional Affairs through electronic

communication will advise Criminal Investigative and National

Security Divisions, and the Office of General Counsel of any

issues for their recommendations for appeal.

The documents listed in the attached letter either

provide appeal issues or the JFK Task Force was in agreement with

ARRE determinations and no postponement issues remain.

Additionally, some of the documents are duplicates of those

previously decided by the ARRB and are without appeal issues.
