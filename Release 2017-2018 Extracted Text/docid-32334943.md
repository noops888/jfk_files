A letter to the Editor appeared in the Paris

Edition of the New York Herald Tribune on 2/26/63 written by

RICHARD GIBSON of Algiers.

He stated in this letter that

black Americans are fed up with the hypocrisy in the white

press concerning the "menace" of Congressman ADAM CLAYTON

POWELL.

He defended POWELL and stated that POWELL is being

abused because of the color of his skin.

He stated that mo

Afro-Americans feel that the real menace to United States

democracy is the system that denies 20 million Americans ofl

African descent equitable representation in the Congress of

their country.
