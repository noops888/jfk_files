had occasion to meet. c.r.

plain white, contains his name = J. T. (JOHN) BRAMLETT,

Office Telephone 6-1485 and home phone 2-0485 and

address 10 Calle 12-31, Zone 1.

This source advised that it was his impression

that BRAMLETT was a'fixer"in illegal activities in

Guatemala and that BRAMLETT was close to the Chief of

Police in Guatemala.

BRAMLETT admitted to the source that he had

contacted in Guatemala by an attorney named

MAROUN from Shreveport, Louisiana in April 1961 about

two days after MARCELLO arrived in Guatemala City.

MAROUN wanted BRAMLETT to use his influence in getting

MARCELLO released from custody which BRAMLETT did do

through influences of the Chief of Police in

BRAMLETT also claimed he had been

instrumental in getting MARCELLO and MAROUN out of

Guatemala into Honduras although he did not go into

details with the source. BRAMLETT told source that

after MARCELLO had been in Honduras for about five days,

through arrangements made by BRAMLETT, MARCELLO was

taken by small boat to an island off the coast of

Honduras about 50 or 100 miles where MARCELLO transferred

to another boat which brought him back to the United

States.

Source said he did not question BRAMLETT

concerning any of

the details of how MARCELLO returned

to the United States because he felt BRAMLETT must be

a real "operator" and he did not want to be too

interested because he did not feel it

would be in his

best interests from the standpoint of his own welfare

while in Guatemala City.
