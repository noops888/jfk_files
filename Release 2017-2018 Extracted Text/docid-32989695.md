NOTE:

By letter 10/15/75, HSC requested the above which

was pursuant to a briefing given Congressman McClory and

members of HSC by INTD on 10/10/75. Subsequent to this request,

Mix. Blackhurst advised that it had been decided that only

generic lists would be submitted to the Committee in response

to these queries and, based on his instructions, these four

questions are being responded to by the submission of the

attached generic lists. Per tir. Blackhurst, in accordance

with White House instructions, EPCI and Flooding lechnique

surveillances are not included in lists three and four.

It is noted the lists on technical and microphone surveillances

pertain to only domestic targets. The entries under

categories "Foreign Intelligence Agents, Foreign Intelligence

Contacts and Foreign Intelligence Agents Suspects" are individ-

uals, involved in Foreign Intelligence operations, who are

nonetheless American citizens.

Therefore, per the Department's

definition of a domestic target as stated

by Steven Blackhurst,

these were included.

UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVIS

SELECT COLMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE (ISC)

NOTE:

SECRET

Sanuel Adason Jaffe was a symbol number informant

of the New York Office from 1958 to 19G1 and was later in

contact with the Washington Field Office. During these

periods of contact, Jaife furnished information on his numerous

contacts with Soviet and People's Republic of China officials,

which were occasioned by his employment with ABC and CBS and

with other news media. u

Following his identification by Soviet defector

["Sammy"Jas having been recruited by the KGB while assigned

to lloscow, Jaife was extensively intervieved and advised that

he believed he had been the subject of a recruitment approach

but denied being a KGB agent. Our relations thereafter wore

conducted with caution in view of L'Samny"s" allogations and

he is not currently being contacted.

Jaffe filed a request under the Freedom of Information

Act in harch, 1975, and subsequently appealed our denial oi

access to information concerning him as contained in our riles.

Jaile has alleged that the FBI, or his association with the FBI,

has prevented him from obtaining work in the news media field.

This allegation is not supported by any material contained in

his file.U

In approximately June, 1975, Jaife net with a triend

of his who is a member ot the senate select Committee on

Intelligence operations.

While he vas discussing his belief

that the FBI has been vindictive toward him because he was

"fingered" by a Soviet defector, Senator Frank Church, Chairman

of the Senate Committoe, ovorheard Jaffe's allegations and ordered

that his Staff interview Jaffe for full details of his allegation.e

The material being furnished the House Connittee

represents all information contained in Jaffe's main file, with

certain exceptions which are explained in the memorandum to the

Committce.

There are also some 200 to 250 references which are

not being furnished, following an agreement between Supervisor

Thonas J. IcNiff and Hiss Inily Sheketoff of the HSC wherein it

was agreed that these need not be made available at present.

communist publication provided the purpose of VAW as

opposition to the "unjustified" war in vietnam.

It announced

that YVAY had joined

"the dissent of

millions of Americans

against the war.

An initial limited inquiry was begun by the

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in September, 1967,

to determine, through inquiries with established sources

and public source material, if the CPUSA was directing or

controlling the newly formed VVAW. This limited inquiry

failed to establish

that the CPUSA, or any other subversive

organization,

exercised direction or control over VVAW.

The

limited inquiry did indicate that VVAW leadership appeared

before the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) sponsored Militant

Labor Forum in New York City, but there was no indication of

any control by the SWP.

With the absence of such direction

or control by any subversive organization,

the limited

inquiry of VVAN was closed in October, 1967. A similar

limited inquiry was conducted in 1968, resulting in an

updated affirmation that VAW was not controlled or dominated

by any

subversive group. This second limited inquiry was

closed

in May, 1968.

During the limited inquiries in

1967 and 1968,

the National Headquarters of VVAW was

located in New

York City.

VVAW activities were primarily

devoted to participation

in and organization of

demonstrations opposing the

war in Vietnam. No full

investigation was

conducted by the FBI of VAW until

August,

1971, when information from a variety of sources

dictated the

need to determine the extent of control

over VVAW by subversive groups

and/or violence-prone

elements in the antiwar movement:

Sources had provided

information that VVAW was stockpiling weapons,

VVAW had

been in contact with North Vietnam officials

in Paris,.

France, VVAW was receiving funds from

former CPUSA

members and VVAW was aiding and financing U.S. military

deserters.

Additionally, information had been received

that some individual chapters throughout the country

had been infiltrated by the youth groups of the CPUSA

and

the SWP.

A trend of increased militancy developed

within the VYAW and the possibilities of violence

escalated within the organization. During December,

1971; VVAW members forcibly and illegally occupied or

surrounded public buildings and national monuments in

buildin

New York City, Philadelphia, Austin, Texas, and

Washington, D. C.

During 1972, the FBI estimated that VYAY had

approximately 1, 800

members and

102 chapters throughout

the country.

VVAW claimed 23,000 members and 283 chapters.

In 1972,

some leaders and activists in the VAW made

trips to Europe and Asia during which they participated

in conferences with representatives and/or officials of

the Soviet Bloc, North Vietnam, and the National

Liberation Front (NLF) Of South Vietnam..

informed the membership that VVAW had been asked to

cooperate on an international level with many organizations,

including communist or Maoist groups, describing these

groups as

"our friends."

When reporting on trips to

Paris, Moscow and Hanoi, VVAW leaders indicated the

organization was dedicated to ending imperialist

aggression and establishing a firm relationship with

the NLI.

In June, 1972, a delegation of fifteen VVAW

members and leaders attended a war crimes conference near

Paris.

The conference, which included representatives

of North Vietnam and the NLF, was sponsored by two

Trotskyist organizations in France.

One of the VAW

national officers addressed this

conference and it was

reported that the French Communist Party had paid for

the expenses of the VYAW contingent at the conference.

During October, 1972, the National Steering

Committee (NSC) of VYAW

met and discussed the direction

of VVAW and the need to make it an anti-imperialist

most of the speakers participating at this

Additionally, it was indicated that VVAl had established

relations with the Irish Republican Arny, had contact

with the angolans,

and was attenpting to establish

liaison with the Peoples

Republic of. China (PRC).

In April, 1973, the organization changed its

name to Wantinier coldler Organization (We/NSO).

The change was made in order to absorb into the organi-

zation, individuals who were not veterans of nilitary

service.

By April, 1073, VVAW/iSO leadership claimed

to have connections with

over 200 foreign organisations

and maintained that Yai/150 was considered a credible

In 1973,

an ideological split becane evident

within the nationnl lenderchin of VVAll/780. The split

arose between those espousing

the Harrist-ioninist

doctrine and those espousing the larxist-Leninist

doctrine as interpreted by MAD Tse tung.

During 1973,

the anti-loist inrxist-leninist group seemed! to be

dominant and expressed determination in educating the

VVAW/130 membership in their doctrine.

By 1973, VVA:/#SO

was composed of approxinately 130 chapters with an

estimatod menbershiy of 2, 000.

The National Headquarters

was, and still is, located in Chicago, Illinois.

By April, 1071, the NSC devoted itself to the

theme of defining VVAJ/W50 as

a politically oriented

The House Select Committee is not in a prosecutive capacity.

You do, of course, have a right to have counsel present.

Anything you say may be used against you at some future time.

Mr. Oliphant. Mr. O'Connor, how long have you been

with the FBI?

Mr. O'Connor. Just a little over seven years.

Mr. Oliphant. What field offices have you been in?

Mr. O'Connor. I have been assigned to the New Orleans

Division, the New York Office, the San Francisco Division and

the washington Field Office. I am currently assigned to the

Headquarters here in Washington.

Mr. Oliphant. How long have you been working in Headquarters

here in Washington?

Mr. O'Connor. Since about the end of May of this year,

Mr. Oliphant. And before that, you were with the Washington

Field Office; is that correct?

years, when

you arrive, to the best

your knowledge?

•• Mr. O'Connor.

It was sometime, I believe, around

the middle or just after

the middle of April of 1971.

Mr. Oliphant. Now, could you describe in chronological

order what your duties were with the Wasington Field Office?

In other words, what squads or units were you assigned to?

Mr. O'Connor. Okay. Initially I was assigned to a squad

that handled New left investigations.

While I was a part

of that squad I was a part of a smaller unit that was engaged

in the investigation to locate certain New Left fugitives. I*

was kind of a criminal-security type of an investigation

we were conducting.

Then I guess it was about september of 1972, I was

transferred from that squad to a squad that conducts bank robbefy

and fugitive investigations.

Mr. Oliphant. From your transfer from the squad and

the unit which dealt with the New Left to the squad which

dealt with bank robbery, since that time; September of

1972, have you had any further contact with New Left

investigations?

Mr. O'Connor. Not that I can recall. You know,!

nothing. I didn't have any investigation leads assigned

to me or something like that as far as I can recall.

Mr. Oliphant.

Okay. Why were you transferred from your

duties with the New Left to your duties with the Bank Robbery

Squad?

Mr. O'Connor. That was à decision that was made by

someone else. I do not know what the basis of it was.

I had indicated

some interest in working criminal work.

Mr. Oliphant. Had you indicated any dissatisfaction

in working radical work?

Mx. O'Connor. Not as such.

I did have a preference for criminal work.

Mr. Oliphant. Since September, 1972, you have been

completely divorced, officially at least, from the New Left,

is that correct?

Mr. O'Connor. That is correct.

Mr. Oliphant. The squad that you worked on when you worked

the New Left--and to put it in a time frame, from April, 1971,

to September, 1972, is that correct?

Mr. O'Connor. Approximately.

Mr. Oliphant. Did that have a nickname or a name?

MI. O'Connor. S-7 Squad.

Mr. Oliphant. Did it have any other nicknames, official or

unofficial?

Mr. O'Connor. No. I always referred to it as s-7,

if I had to describe it.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you ever hear anybody iefer to it as

the Red Squad?.

Mr. O'Connor. No.

Regarding a smaller

you worked with,

the fugitive urit, did you work closely with Guy Goodwin

at all?

Mr. O'Connor. I never did. As a matter of fact, I

never did meet Mr. Goodwin.

I know that he was concerned with some of the bombing

investigations.

But I personally did not work with him.

Mr. Oliphant. Mr. O'Connor, tell me this: When you

were working with this squad, how were you dressed? How

did you come to work? What did you look like?

Mr. O'Connor. Initially I came to work in a suit and

tie. But beginning, I suppose, during the summer of '71,

I began to grow a beard and long hair and at some point

I began to dress in old clothes.

Mr. Oliphant. Why was that?

Mr. O'Connor. It facilitated certain of our investigations,

surveillance and things of that nature where we would blend

into an area in which we were conducting a physical surveillance

of some sort.

Mr. Oliphant.

Sure. Was this your idea?

Mr.

O'Connor. Part of it was. It was a combination of

my idea and the Bureau was interested 'in having people who

did have that particular appearance.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you have to receive Bureau approval

for that?

Me. O'Connor.

Yes.

Mr. Oliphant. How did that come about?

Mr. O'Connor. Initially we were, because of the way

we looked, we kind of blended into the area around Dupont

Circle. As I recall, one of

the agents on one of the

criminal squads was looking for an individual up around

the Dupont Circle area.:

It was some kind'of a fugitive

investigation. They had asked us if we could help them.

an officer by

he name of Carl Shoffler.

He said that he

knew somebody up around the Circle who might know the

individual, who was

familiar with the Dupont Circle area.

So he took us up there and introduced -- I don't know whether

there was anybody else with me aside from Carl -- he

introduced me to this individual, Butch, showed him the

photograph, I do not know if he showed him any other photographs,

but he didn't seem to know the person.

Shortly thereafter, around October 1, Meritt called me

ẠT

in the office and he said that he had been working. for the

Metropolitan Police Department, that he was dissatisfied with

them and that he wanted to go to work for us if we would pay

him enough for the information which he said he could furnish.

Mr. Oliphant. So it was Merritt who initiated the contacts.

This was purely sort of a chance initial acquaintance to find

this fugitive, a one-shot affair, is that correct?

Mr. O'Connor. That is correct.

Mr. Oliphant. You did not expect him to call you back

or be in contact with you again?

Mr. O'Connor. No. As a matter of fact, I was surprised

that he did.

Mr. Oliphant. What did you say to him when he called?

Mr. O'Connor. I asked him what kind of information he

could furnish. Basically, to put it in general terms, he said

he could furnish information concerning criminal matters

and: what. we wc

MI. Oliphant. What sort of criminal matters?

Mr. O'Connor. Fugitive matters, perhaps narcotics

information which we would pass along to whatever agency

would be interested in 1t.. He also said that he was concerned

because he felt that we might be looking for him

concerning a fraudulent check or a bad check matter. I don't

know quite how

he put it, but it involved a check.

Mr. Oliphant. Did he bring that out in this initial

phone call?

Mr. O'Connor. He brought it out. He said, fI have

one problem before I go to work for you?

He said, jI have

this problem and I think the FBI has been looking for me

in this matter.

He was calling me. I knew where he lived,

but I might explain that I could never call him except to

return a call to a pay phone because he did not have a phone

in his residence. He said that he was concerned about this.

I said I was going to have to check. I told him at that time

that if I found out that we either wanted him on an outstanding

warrant or we wanted to talk to him, that somebody was

going to be up to see him, or try to, you know.

Mr. Oliphant. When was this, Mr: O'Connor?

MI. O'Connor. He called me about October 1.

Mr. Oliphant. 1971?

Mr. O'Connor. 1971, excuse me. I probably got back to

him within a day or so. But I did check and I did find

that we had been interested in him with respect to a bad check

matter and that the U. S. Atrorney's Office in West Virginia

had declined prosecution. I also checked NCIC to see if there

were any outstanding warrants for him or anything like that

under his true pame which he had said he had not been using.

He gave me his true name.

Mr. Oliphant. Let me ask you this: Did you inform him

that the U. S. Attorney in West Virginia had declined prose-

cution?

MI. O'Connor. That is what I was just about to tell

you. I certainly did. I told him that as far as I knew that

the prosecution had been declined and that I had found that

he was - I don't know whether he was - I guess he was the

subject of the investigation, and that the U. S. Atforney's

Office had declined prosecution, that I couldn't find that

he was wanted anyplace else and as far as I was concerned

that was no longer a stumbling block.

Mx. Oliphant. When did you tell him this?

Mr. O'Connor. It would have been a day or two after

the initial phone call, if it wasn't the same day.

Mr. Oliphant. So we are still working within the

first five days of October, roughly?

Mr. O'Connor. Yes.

MI. O'Connor. I don't think it was - he gave me some

me some information not too long after and it was within

a week or ten days and I paid him shortly thereafter.

Mr. Oliphant. How much did you pay him?

MI. O'Connor. I do not remember exactly. I would have

to guess.

Mr. Oliphant. If he said that he was paid $75, would

that seem to be an accurate figure?

Mr. O'Connor. The first time?

Mr. Oliphant. Yes.

Mr. O'Connor. I don't think so.

Mr. Oliphant. Was he ever paid on a regular basis?

Mr. Oliphant. Do you know, then, as a matter of

clincidence, what were the periods in which he received

moneys?

MI. O'Connor. It would depend on the frequency at which

we received information.

Mr. Oliphant. Do you know if the amounts he received varied

from time to time?

MI. O'Connor. They did.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you also pay expenses?

Mr. O'Connor. Occasionally.

MI. Oliphant. Do you recall the most you ever paid him

at one time?

MI. O'Connor. No, I don't. In one lump sum? No.

Mr. Oliphant. What was the nature of the information

which he referred to you?

Mr. O'Connor. Generally, or the first time?

Mr. Oliphant. Let's say the first time.

Mr. O'Connor. I think the first time we really

went out and talked to him, Bill Tucker and I went out and talked

to him, we talked generally and we got information that

would have been security-type information. We showed him

photographs of the weathermen fugitives we were looking for,

things of that nature. I do not know whether we got criminal

information from him at that time or not.

Mr. O'Connor. We never

work as partners as such, but

Bill and I

work together quite a bit during the time

I worked on S-7, most of the time while I had the long

hair and the beard.

Mr. Oliphant. Did there come a time when you knew that

Earl Robert Meritt had contacts with the IPS Institute?

Mr. O'Connor. Yes, he told us that at the outset.

Mr. Oliphant. Were you interested in that?

MI. O'Connor.

Yes.

Mr. Oliphant. Why?

Mr. C'Connor. For two

reasons. One, we felt that

there were certain weathermen fugitives who might be in

contact with individuals who were associata with the

INTEREST

Institute, and furthermore, we did have an intelligence,

it was really a secondary concern to us because our

primary concerns were the new left fugitives.

But the Bureau also did have an intelligence investigation

concerning the Institute.

Mr. Oliphant. Do you know why they had an intelligence

interest in the Institute?

Mr. O'Connor. I could not give you the specific

reasons because that was not by case. For instance, I was

familiar with some aspects of it, but what the real root

25

of it was, I didn't know.

well, one of the things we were concerned

about was the fact that it seemed to us that a lot of

demonstrations had their roots out there. I guess that

would have been the thing that I was primarily aware of.

Mr. Oliphant. Did someone tell you that the IPS was an

intelligence target?

MI. O'Connor. Yes.

MI. Oliphant. Who told you that?

Mr. O'Connor. That could have been any one of a number

of people.

Mr. Oliphant. Can you list the people who you believe

told you it was an intelligence target?

Mr. O'Connor. Could 'I ask a question off the record?

(Discussion off the recora.)

Mr. Atkisson. Mr. O'Connor, let me say something that

perhaps should have been said at the beginning of this

interview.

Mx. Oliphant and I do not want you to speculate or

guess whenever we ask you a question. Indeed, all answers

should be of your own knowledge.

If you do not have a personal knowledge of the subject

we ask you about, you should so state. In addition to

that, if you do not understand a question, please feel

to tell us that you don't understand it and

ask us to

clarify it or restate it:

With that caveat, let us resume.

Mr. Oliphant. I will rephrase the question here.

You stated that IPS was a traget?

Mr. O'Connor. The Institute for Policy Studies was the

subject of an investigation.

Mr. Oliphant. And it is fair to characterize it as an

intelligence target, is that correct?

Mc. O'Connor. I think so.

Mr. Oliphant. Now, who told you that it was an intelligence

target, or more specifically how did you know it was an

intelligence target?

Mr. O'Connor. Well, I knew from talking to the

case agent. I'm sure I talked to the case agent and just from

general conversation on the sguad. I cannot remember who

the case agent was at that time.

There was general conversation. Over and above that,

it would have been confirmed by the case agent. I cannot

remember. It could have been an agent by the name of sawyer.

I know he had the case assigned to him at one time.

Mr. Oliphant. Why was IPS a target?

Mr. O'Connor. I don't remember specifically. I do know

that as I said

before, we were concerned because we did feel

that there were a number of demonstrations that had their

roots back,

nought they had their roos back there at

IPS. There were a number of organizations

• involved in

demonstrations, for. instance, who were representatives which

spent time

up there. That was, as I recall, one of the

reasons that we were Interested in it.

That would have been the reason with which I was most

familiar because we were concerned at that time with demonstra-

tions.

Mr. Atkisson. What kind of demonstrations are you

talking about?

Mr. O'Connor. Demonstrations in the nature of May Day

demonstrations.

Mr. Atkisson. Well, my recollection of the history

of the times is that there were not very many demonstrations

on that scale.

Are you talking about May Day itself, or others like

May Day, but smaller in scale?

Mr. O'Connor. Yes, May Day. would have been, I guess,

the culmination at that time.

I was not familiar with anything

that had gone on before that time and any involvement they

may have had in any previous demonstrations.

Mr. Oliphant. Were you ever told that IPS was a

center for subersives?

MI. O'Connor.

Yes. If I was not told that, I would have

gotten the impression very definitly. I would say, yes, that

it would have been a center for subversives. I probably

was told that. Who would have told me that, I don't know.

Mr. Oliphant. Why would you say that?.

Mr. O'Connor. Because it was and it is still my

impression that not all persons up there were not necessarily

people who would be considered subversives but that there

were people up there who we would have considered to be

subversive perhaps.

Mr. Oliphant. Did there come a time when you asked Earl

Robert Merritt to try and infiltrate himself into the IPS?

Mr. O'Connor. Well, Merritt had told us when he first

contacted me that he had already been, well, he was associated

with people up there. He knew people up there. He had been

performing odd jobs up there

for the Institute and for

particular individuals up there at the Institute on a

regular basis; that he knew Mr. Waskow, Mr. Raskin, Jo Anne Malone

and some other individuals up there.

Mr. Oliphant. Were these people targets or were there

cases opened on these people?

Mr. O'Connor. Yes, there were.

Mr. Oliphant. Why were there cases opened on them,

if you know?

• -

• Mr. O'Connor.

They would have been security type

cases. We were interested in their activities. Why they were

originally opened,

I don't know.

Mr. Oliphant. I-asked you if you ever asked MI. Merritt

to infiltrate. You said that he had told you he was

in contact with the people. But did you ask him to try and

stay in touch-and try and get a job there?

MI. O'Connor. Yes, I did. •

Mr. Oliphant. Was he able to?

Mr. O'Connor. As I understood it he was up there on

a very regular basis and he did odd jobs for them.

He

told us they were considering giving him a permanent job

up there. That never materialized. He never did get what

would be considered a regular job up there.

Mr. Oliphant. Did there come a time when Mr. Merritt

called you and told you that he had some mail and some

other documents and papers and such from the IPS?

MX. O'Connor. No.

Mr. Oliphant. Was there ever any time when he called

you in the evening saying he had just taken some mail from

the IPS or taken some documents?

Mr. O'Connor. No.

leave for the Thanksgiving weekend. He apparently called

Bill and told him that he had obtained some stuff from the

trash up there.

I ended up meeting Bill and giving him

an envelope that he said came from the trash along with

the contents of the envelope which were in the trash and gave

them to Bill..

Mr. Oliphant. To your knowledge, did he ever steal

some mail and give it either to you or Mr. Tucker and then,

after this mail was evaluated, did you personally ever

return it to him?

Mr. O'Connor. No, we never had any mail. With respect

to this envelope that he gave us, we had the envelope. We

never did inventory the thing. We Xeroxed a copy of a speech

that was in it. I believe it had been given at People's Grand

Jury earlier by an individual who was connected with IPS.

We took the envelope and its contents and gave it back

to Merritt and told him to return it to the trash of IPs,

if that is where it belonged.

Mr. Oliphant. Did he ever give you a letter from Colgate

University to Professor Waskow, which contained an airline

ticket?

No, not necessarily. It just happened

to be a trait that he had.

MI. Oliphant. Did this make him desirable as an informant?

Mr. O'Connor. Well, he might be able to - it is possible

that he might be able to get close to people that other indi-

viduals would not be able to get close to.

MI. Oliphant. No pun intended?

MI. O'Connor. No.

Mr. O'Connor. You mean just the fact that people were

homosexuals?

Mr. Oliphant. Yes.

Mr. O'Connor. No.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you ever incorporate this information

into any reports?

Mr. O'Connor. jes.

Mr. Oliphant. Why?

MI. O'Connor. Well, because with respect to one individual

for instance, he continued to bring up the fact that the man

was a homosexual.

Mr. Oliphant. Why was this relevant?

Mr. O'Connor. It was relevant, I suppose, because this

was one facet of the man's personality.

.. As far as I recall it was no secret. The man made

no secret of that fact. It was one of the reasons that we

felt that Merritt had a better chance of getting close

to the individual, again not in an intimate sense.

Mr. Oliphant. What sort of individual was this?

MI. O'Connor. The individual's name was Jack Davis.

gossip or any details regarding homosexuality with regard

•to prominent American citizens?

MI. O'Connor. Did we ever ask him for that information?

Mr. Oliphant. Yes.

MI. O'Connor. No, we did not.

Mr. Atkisson.

to your knowledge?

Mr. O'Connor. No. He would volunteer that information

from time to time. We didn't ask him for it. It was not the

type

of thing that we would record.

Mr. Atkisson. Did you encourage it?

Mr. O'Connor.

No, we didn't.

As far as I was concerne, d the Bureau didn't really

have any interest in gossip as such.

report that you did, any type of information concerning

homosexual activities of any prominent government or municipal

excuse me, what I am hesitating at is that some of these

questions you are asking are questions that if I answer very

flatly--I think they probably should be elaborated upon.

Mr. Oliphant. Certainly.

We are not trying to pin you down, go ahead.

Mr. O'Connor.

He did. I don't know if it was on one

occasion or on two occasions, or what.

He did mention that there were a couple of individuals

who were the victims of extortion as a result of their

sexual activities. He could never take this past the rumor

stage.

We told him that if in fact he could substantiate it

there would be a criminal violation and we would certainly

do something about it. But since that was never taken past

the rumor stage, it was never made a matter of record.

Mr. Flannagan. May we clarify? The criminal violation

is the extortion and not the homosexuality.

Mr. Oliphant. Yes, 18 USC 94.

Did you ever threaten Mr. Merritt regarding his check

violations?

Merritt had nothing to worry about as far as we knew.

Mr. O'Connor. I knew he had been an informant because

he said he had been an informant. What he did for the

Metropolitan Police Department specifically, I don't know.

I assume he had apparently had, based on his statements

to me, he would have been concerned with the May Day demonstra-

tions and people involved with it and I guess the Institute

for Policy Studies, too.

ship with the Intelligence Division at the Metropolitan

Police Department, didn't you?

Mr. O'Connor. Myself?

Mr. Oliphant. Yes.

Mr. O'Connor. I talked to people down there occasionally.

Mr. Oliphant. When you take on an informant with the

as to his reliability probably would have been based

on the fact that Officer Shoffler had introduced me.

He apparently considered him to be reliable.

Mr. Oliphant. Did he tell you he was reliable?

Ar. O'Connor. Yes, I believe so.

He did furnish some good information.

Mr. Oliphant. Shoffler was basically interested in criminal

matters, wasn't he?

Mr. O'Connor.

Yes, he was. I wanted to make that

distinction. He was not assigned to the Intelligence Branch.

Mr. Oliphant. But Merritt had been working with

intelligence officers; hadn't he?

Mr. O'Connor. Yes.

Mr. Oliphant. Why didn't you ask them?

Mr. O'Connor. I think there was a conversation I had

with them but it was primarily a conversation and if I

talked to anybody, I would have talked to Chris Scrapper.

The conversation would have been just to make sure we

his reliability?

Mr. O'Connor. No, not that I know of.

Mr. Oliphant. Do you know if anybody inquired regarding

his reliability?

Mr. O'Connor. Not off hand.

Mr. Oliphant. Were you ever apprised of what kind of

activities he had been conducting for the Intelligence

Division of the Metropolitan Police Department?

Mr. O'Connor. No.

Mr. Oliphant. Did he ever tell you?

Mr. O'Connor. He told us that he was concerned, that

they were concerned about people involved with the May Day

demonstrations, Jack Davis and Rennie Davis, I guess, and some

of those individuals; and that they were concerned about

IPS. As far as the specific activities were concerned, no.

Mr. Oliphant. Did he ever inform you that he had been

asked to do some break-ins for the Metropolitan Police

Department?

Mr. O'Connor. Not that I recall, no.

Mr. Oliphant. Did he ever tell you that they asked

him to take things from the various liberal or radical groups

Mr. O'Connor. I never did.

Mr. Oliphant. Not even membership lists?

Mr. O'Connor. Well, let's put it this way: I tola

him never to take anything wrongfully. If he came across

a leaflet or a pamphlet or something like that, or

anything he had a right to have, that was a different matter,

he could obviously have that; but as far as taking anything

in the sense of taking it, whether he had a right to have

it or not, no, we never told him that.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you specifically tell him that

if he did not have a right to take given material, he was

not to take it?

Mr. O'Connor. That if he didn't have a right to have

something, that he shouldn't take it, yes, and that he was

never to do anything illegal. I told him this on several

occasions.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you define for him what were illegal

activities?

Mr. O'Connor. Well, I'm sure that I probably mentioned

theft and break-ins since that would have been the primary

activity that he probably would have been involved in, you

very close: to his residence.

Mr. Oliphant. What sort of place was it?

Mr. O'Connor. I have

never been in it. I assume that

it was a book store that had a lot of materials that were

political, New Left type reading material.

Mr. Oliphant. Why do you assume that?

Mr. O'Connor. Because that was my understanding:

You know, he used. to go into the place all the time.

He would tell me what they had in there and other people

told me what they had in there.

ask him to do something iike that.

Hebrew Congregations?

Mr. O'Connor. I became familiar with it when I read

an article written by Jack Anderson in the Washington Post

a couple of weeks ago.

Mr. Oliphant. Is that your first knowledge?

Mr. O'Connor. That is my first knowledge of that

organization. As far as I know, the FBI never had an interest

in that organization.

Mr. Oliphant. Were you ever brought a box full of

envelopes that were addressed that purported to come from

the Union of the American Hebrew Congregations?

MI. O'Connor. No.

Mr. Oliphant. Were you aware of any break-ins that

Merritt performed before he became associated with the

Federal Bureau of Investigation?

Mr. O'Connor. No. I don't recall him ever talking about

breaking into any place. Do you mean while he would have been

Did you ever recall him talking about any

break-ins after or

during the time he became involved

Mr. O'Connor. No.

Mr. Oliphant. Are you familiar with the ADEX list?

Do you know what ADEX is?

Mr. O'Connor. Yes, there was an ADEX list. I know that

certain persons were on that list but I don't remember

the criteria for the thing.

Mr. Oliphant. Were any of the people at IPS on the

ADEX list?

Mr. O'Connor. That is possible. I don't recall specifically.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you have access to the ADEX list?

Mr. O'Connor.

To the list itself?

Mr. Oliphant. Yes.

Mr. O'Connor. No.

Mr. Oliphant. What did you tell Merritt regarding the

people that were working at IPS, or connected with IPS?

Mr. O'Connor. We told him we were interesetd in finding

out whether any of the fugitives had any contact with indi

viduals up there. We thought that they might have contact

with Waskow or Raskin.

Mr. Oliphant. Why did you think that?

Mr. O'Connor. Basically because Mike Spiegel, who was

one of the fugitives, and Cathy Willerson had previous

association with the Institute and with those people

specifically, as

I recall.

We felt that the fugitives were

most likely to be getting asistance from that type of a

person, people who had money and people who had agreed

with them idiologically.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you ever characterize in any way

the individuals at IPS to Merritt?

Mr. O'Connor. Characterize them?

Mr. Oliphant. Did you characterize them as radicals,

as subversives, as communists, for example? .

Mr. O'Connor. I don't know whether I ever used those

terms.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you use similar terms?

MI. O'Connor. I can't remember.

He probably would have gotten that impression.

Mr. Oliphant. Why would he have received that impression

from you?.

Mr. O'Connor. In view of the fact that we thought

they might have some contact with these fugitives and

the fact that they were involved in some of these demonstra-

tions, et cetera.

He knew that was the type of thing we were interested

in.

• Mr. Oliphant. Did you personally regard the people

at IPS as dangerous?

• 25

Mr. Oliphant. How did you receive that impression?

concerning these individuals.

Mr. Oliphant. Conversations with whom?

Mr. O'Connor. With other agents.

MI. Atkisson. Following up briefly on the question Tim

just asked and you answered, you and Agent Tucker and I

gather a number of agents in the Washington Field Office were

all interested in IPS and specifically Special Agent Sawyer,

Van Wagenen, Rogers, Rudiger, Feuer, and J. P. Chase.

That is fully six agents in the Washington Field Office

involved in IPS surveillance. Did you have much contact

with those agents?

Mr. O'Connor. All of them were on the same squad

I was on.

Mr. Atkisson. And you worked closely with these six

individuals?

Mr. O'Connor. We worked in the same sguad room and I

would talk to them occasionally, yes.

individuals that you first received the impression that IPs

was generally dangerous?

would probably be agents among those

agents, yes.

Mr. Atkisson. At the time you were involved in investi-

gating IPS, from which specific person did you derive, in

your impression of things,

from which specific person

did you derive your authority to investigate IPS? Who told

you to do it?

Mr. O'Connor. It would have been probably the supervisor.

Mr. Atkisson. I'm asking where you got your authority.

You are speculating.

Mr. O'Connor. I don't know. I would not have gotten

authority.as such. What I am saying is if you obtained

information which appeared to be pertinent to an investigation

that was being conducted and you were aware, well, obviously

you gave that or provided that information to whoever was

interested.

In other words, I knew there was an investigation

and therefore, I would just provide the information, any

information that would be pertinent, whether it be IPS or

anything else. •

Mr. O•Connor. John Palmer, at that time.

Mr. Atkisson. Is he in the Washington Field Office, or

was he at that time?

Yes.

I think he still is, too.

as a result of your association with Robert Merritt?

How long did those three things coincide?

to about the end of January, when we told Merrittto stay

away from 'IPS.

Mr. Oliphant.

why did you tell Merritt to stay away*

from IPS?

Mr. O'Connor. Well, because it appeared that his efforts

up there were at best counter-productive. He just didn't

belong up there.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you have any other homosexual informants.

Mr. O'Connor. Informants as such, no.

with the Bureau, did you ever ask any of these people to

Agent Tucker or any other FBI agents?

Mr. O'Connor. Not that I know of. Do you mean another

informant or homosexual informant?

Not that I can recall.

(Discussion off therecord.)

Mr. O'Connor. I did want tosay as far as that

envelope was concerned, the contents of that--you were asking

about mail, I don't recall that there was any mail in there,

anything that would have obviously come from the mail or

would have been intended for the mail. Whether anything

had been in the mail or not, I don't know. You know, it is

conceivable that something had been in the mail, but I don't

gone through the mail, for instance.

if somebody else answered the phone. But I believe he used

Butch more than he did Eric.

Mr. Oliphant. Why was Merritt terminated?

Mr. O'Connor. Merritt was terminated because we found

out that he had been furnishing us unreliable information.

Mr. Oliphant. What sort of unreliable information?

Mr. O'Connor. We found out that information he had

been furnishing us concerning Jack Davis was unreliable.

We found out that specific information was unreliable and

we went back and started considering some of the other things

he had told us about davis. We felt what he might have been

doing was playing both ends against the middle. What he was

doing was furnishing us not only unreliable, but misleading

information.

Mr. Oliphant. Was his termination acrimonious?

Mr. O'Connor. For him, I guess it was.

Mr. Oliphant. Were there harsh words said at the end?

Mr. O'Connor. Not between myself and Merritt, and not

between Tucker and Merritt, as far as I recall. I do know

that we told him that we were terminating him. We didn't

tell him why. We told him it was because he had furnished

unreliable information and Iguess we probably told him, or

he could have surmised, it was about Jack Davis, if we did

Mr. O'Connor. It could have been anyplace. We wanted

to get away. We drove up there and pulled off the road and

talked to him. We told him we weren't going to accept any

more information from him on a confidential basis and he

could not consider himself an informant any longer.

Mr. Atkisson. Where did you usually meet with Merritt

when you got information from him?

Mr. O'Connor. It would have been 'in any number of places.

Mr. O'Connor. Yes. There are some picnic areas up there.

criminal matters that we passed on to the police. Whether

they ever presented --

Mr. Oliphant. As far as the FBI, you never even presented

a case to the Department of Justice, is that correct,

based on this?

Mr. O'Connor. No.

Mr. O'Connor. I think over that period of time he was

paid about 1600, including payment fot services and for

expenses.

and was categorized as a criminal informant because he was

furnishing criminal information.

As far as we knew he was reliable until we found out

that he wasn't.

justification to get money for an informant?

MI. O'Connor. Yes, but he was actually, well, the

information he was furnishing us was of value to us as

assistance in an investigation that we were conducting,

primarily with respect to the time that we were interested in

Jack Davis. I think it was probably during that time that

he got the bulk of that $1600.

on one occasio

that Jack Davis was in

contact with Mike

Spiegel.

Mr. Oliphant.

Was Spiegel a fugitive?

MI. O'Connor. Yes. These were the people we were

interested in. Those investigations were not very easy

investigations.

You just didn't go out and pick somebody

up. He also told us that he had seen Bill Ayers with Jack

Davis on one occasion. He also indicated that Jack Davis

had some knowledge of an individual involved in the Capitol

bombing. This was the type of information he was furnishing

to us.

MI. Oliphant. Did you ever make any comments to him

regarding Jews?

Mr. O'Connor. No. In what sense?

Mr. Oliphant. Well, did you ever tell him that Jews

were liberal?

Mr. O'Connor. No.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you ever tell him that they were behind,

or part of, let's say, the Communist threat?

Mr. O'Connor. No. I think there are a lot of Irish

who are involved in some of the liberal politics so I

don't believe you can --.

Mr. Oliphant. Off the record.

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Oliphant. Let me just get back to IPS. Were there

a number öf t

gets, groups not readily identifiable as

Communist, let's say, or Communist organizations, groups

like the IPS that were intelligence targets?

Mr. O'Connor. Organizations like that?

Mr. Oliphant. Yes.

Mr. O'Connor. There were organizations that would have

been intelligence targets.

Mr. Oliphant. Who were the sort of groups that were

intelligence targets?

Mr. O'Connor. I guess PCPJ, People's Coalition for

Peace and Justice particularly because of their role in May Day!

the May Day organization.

We were interested in some groups

that at that time appeared to be trying to, right around

the time Merritt began to work for us, were interested in,

it appeared that they were interested in stirring up problems

in the prisons because there were quite a few problems

in the prisonsat that time.

That would have been another type of group we were

interested in in order to try to find out what a group like

that was trying to do. They organized demonstrations,

for instance, and we wanted to know how disruptive the demonstra-

tions might be.

Mr. Oliphant. At what level was a decision made to make

a group an intelligence target?

What level would that have been within the FBI?

MI. O'Connor. I guess in some cases it might have

been in the field office. But in other cases, it probably

would have been in Headquarters.

Mr. Oliphant. With regard to IPS, where was the decision

made?

• Mr. O'Connor. I have no idea.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you need permission before you

could opean a case on an individual?

Mr. O'Connor. Yes.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you need permission before you

could open a case on an organization?

Mr. O'Connor. Yes.

Mr. Oliphant. Where did you receive your permission

from?

MI. O'Connor. Well, usually, what you would do is,

I guess it would normally come from a supervisor.

He was

the man who usually opened and assigned cases.

Mr. Oliphant. Was the supervisor the one who told

you that the FBI was interested in IPS?

Mr. O'Connor. Well, I would imagine he mentioned it.

I do not know whether he was the one who told me initially.

'As I said before, I knew that we had that pending investigation.

Mr. O'Connor. They were, some of this prison activity was

centered up there, and for a very short period of time we

were interested in the Red House of people connected with

the Red House Collective.

MI. Atkisson. Were you personally interested in the

Mr. 'Atkisson.

Did MI. Merritt ever tell you that he knew

about a potential job in the

employ of Ethel Kennedy?

Mr. O'Connor.

No.

Mr. Atkisson.

He never mentioned that?

Mr. O'Connor. No. The first time I saw that was in the

same column that I referred to before.

Mr. Atkisson. So it is your testimony that until that

column in Jack Anderson you never heard of any job in the

employ of Ethel Kennedy?

Mr. O'Connor. No.

Mr. Atkisson. You never encouraged Mi. Merritt to take

such a job with Ethel Kennedy?

Mr. O'Connor. No.

Mr. Atkisson. Did you encourage him to take any other job

when he first developed a relationship with the Bureau?

Mr. O'Connor. Yes; the job at the Institute.

Mr. Atkisson. Incidentally, do you know what his first

contact with the Institute was?

Mr. O'Connor.

No, I don't.

Mr. Atkisson. You say that he was already involved in

the Institute when you met him?

Mr. O'Connor. That is what he told me.

• Mr. Atkisson. Did he say that was a result of the under-

cover activities with the Metropolitan Police Department?

Mr: Atkisson

So before; when I asked

you if you knew

what his first connection with it was, the answer should have

been you knew it was

because he was acting in undercover

capacity with the Metropolitan Police Department?

Mr. O'Connor. I thought you asked me what he had been

doing for the Metropolitan Police Department, and I thought I

said he was involved with May Day people and with the Institute.

Mr. Atkisson. You also mentioned that you wanted to make

sure that the Bureau wasn't stealing an informant from the

Metropolitan Police Department. I gather that you satisfied

yourself that you were not stealing an informant from the

Metropolitan Police Department.

Mr. O'Connor. Yes; as I recall, I am pretty sure I talked

to somebody down there and it was Scrapper, but I don't

actually recall, you know, the conversation other than the fact

I probably would have been -- I don't even know whether I

would have done it. I would have wanted to make sure we were

not taking somebody else's informant away because he had said

that he was an informant for the Police Department.

Mr. Atkisson. Do you know whether after he became in-

volved with the FBI he maintained a relationship with the

Metropolitan Police Department?

MI. O'Connor.

I know that he talked to an officer down

there, but I don't know what - while he was working for us?

MI. Atkisson. Yes.

O'Connor. I know there was an officer down there

Mr. Atkisson.

How about Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,

did you know of any relationship he might have had with them?

Mr. O'Connor. He said he worked for them.

Mr. Atkisson. At the same time he worked for the Bureau?

Mr. O'Connor. Not that I know of. I don't know whether

he was or not. He could have been.

Mr. Atkisson. You understand, I am sure, the distine-

tion between rositive and negative information, do you not?

Positive and negative information?

Mr. O'Connor. In what sense?

Mr. Atkisson. Well, isn't it the case as a Special Agent

when you conduct an investigation and then you write a report

on that investigation that the information can be either posi-

tive or negative?

Mr. O'Connor. It could be.

Mr. Atkisson. If it is positive, it is relevant to some

investigative purpose; if it is negative, it is just as the

word implies, not relevant to the investigative purpose?

MI. O'Connor. Yes.

Mr. Atkisson. Is that parlance that is used at the Bureau

or is that parlance only being used by me at the moment?

Mr. O'Connor. I think I understand what you mean.

Bureau to inclu

negative information along with any positive

information in reports that you write?

Mr. O'Connor.

I don't know whether it wouldn't be

difficult: to sometimes - I would almost have to have an

example, sir. There are times when I think that we would get

information and it really wasn't my position to be evaluating

it.

It might be questionable, you know.

Mr. Atkisson. In your opinion. I realize I am solicit-

ing an opinion, counsel, but in your opinion from your seven

years' experience in the Bureau, would information about the

personal sex lives of individuals at IPS be considered

positive or negative?

Mr. Flannagan. That is a hypothetical?

Mr. Atkisson. That is correct.

Let's put you back in that period of time in late 1971,

early 1972. Suppose you came across such information, would

you, do you think, have included it in any reports that you

wrote up?

Mr. O'Connor. That somebody was

Mr. Atkisson. Just information you obtained from a

source, from whatever. Would you have included such informa-

tion in any report you drew up?

Mr. O'Connor. That an individual was a homosexual?

Mr. Atkisson. No; I didn't say that. Any information

concerning the personal sex lives of individuals involved at

Mr. O'Connor.

Not unless I thought it was pertinent to an

investigation; no.

Mr. Atkisson. All right. Just one more question about

your final conversation with Robert Merritt in Rock Creek Park.

Had you ever at any other time in your experience at the Bureau

of Investigation held a conversation that was in any way

business-related in Rock Creek Park?

Mr. O'Connor. I don't recall offhand, because the thing

is that when you are talking to - I probably wouldn't have

conducted any kind of normal interview there, but if you are

talking about an informant -- I don't know whether we ever

talked to Merritt there at any other time:

Mr. Atkisson.

Where did you meet Merritt on the day you

drove to Rock Creek Park?

Mr. O'Connor. That I don't remember. It probably would

have been right around the DuPont Circle area some place.

Mr. Oliphant. Didn't you say before you usually met him

in DuPont Circle?

Mr. O'Connor. In the DuPont Circle area.

Mr. Oliphant. Why did you drive to Rock Creek Park, then?

Mr. O'Connor. Occasionally we did drive away from the

area, and we wanted to go up there and explain this to him,

because I knew what his reaction was going to be.

MI. Oliphant. What was his reaction?

tions to you concerning Jack Davis about his whereabouts on a

Mr. O'Connor. Let me put it this way: we developed in-

formation that not only was there a problem or discrepancy

concerning Davis' whereabouts on this particular weekend, but

also that much of the information that he had been furnishing

us could not have been correct, you know, over a period of

time.

interest in an area that we -- what had seemed very credible

to us when it came

about before.

Mr. Oliphant. You don't have to say exactly what it was.

Mr. O'Connor.

It had to do with Davis, the information

that we knew was incorrect, and we knew where this information

had come from and with, respect to the investigation concerning

Davis there was something in there that I would have considered

to have rebutted

or to have contradicted the information that

Merritt had previously furnished concerning Davis, but I never

did; no -- in answer to your question, I never wrote anything

up. It was understood that this information concerning Davis

was -- much of it or some portion of it --

Mr. Oliphant. Would that be readily understandable by

reading the files?

Mr. O'Connor.

Yes; some portion of it was incorrect.

Mr. Oliphant. How could someone understand that without

revealing. what it was?

Mr. O'Connor. In other words, if they read something --

Mr. Oliphant. Let's say an objective person read this ten

years from now without the benefit of being able to speak with

you or with whoever the other agents were who spoke with Davis

and looked, would they see two conflicting reports? would

they see series of information that came, let's say, from

Merritt and another series of information that came from Davis,

or someone else?

Mr. O'Connor. It would all be - you know, if they read

we didn't go back and ask Merritt how

us was false.

There was no way we could do that, so what we were doing -

what we had was the information we had developed which would

have shown up chronologically, I guess, in the investigative

file.

So if you would have read down the line, all of a sudden

you would have come to a point, as far as I am concerned,

where you would have seen, you know, that we were able to

determine that at least some of the information concerning Davis

was incorrect. I am saying as far as some of the other informat

Mr. O'Connor. I would like to put one further thing on.

the record.

Basically,

with respect to these allegations which first

started, I think, in the Summer of 1973, even at that time

those allegations really centered around IPS. Since then they

have gone beyond that. Even when those first allegations were

made, I didn't recall specifically the details of some of the

things that we were talking about, and I don't think there was

-any way we could have. About the only way we could have would

have been to look in files or try to rely on memory as best we

could. And still today, if we are talking about some of these

other areas concerning which the man has made allegations, we

are dealing with even a longer period of time, and some of

them I know -- I know we didn't have any interest in the

organization he is talking about, but if we did have an inter-

est in the organization, you

know, I am trying to be completely

candid with you with respect to what we were interested in and

what we are trying to do so that we just don't say we weren't

interested in people at all, but, you know, the specifics of

incidents or the specifics of the information he was furnishing

I don't remember.'

How many documents,

ughly, were inside?

Mr. O'Connor. I couldn't tell you. Maybe the thing might.

have been that thick or so (indicating), but that is specula-

tion.

Mr. Oliphant. What did you do with these documents? :

Mr. O'Connor. Well, we looked at some of them and deter-

mined that there were some things in there that were obviously

nondescript trash and took the speech and copied it, or I

copied it, and then we took that and I don't know whether Bill

went with mr or not, but I met Merritt and gave it back to him

and told him to put it back in there.

Mr. Oliphant. Where?

Mr. O'Connor. In the trash, if that is where it belonged,

at IPS.

I frankly didn't like that situation at all.

Mr. Oliphant. Why?

Mr. O'Connor. Because, first of all, Merritt had been

told not to take anything he shouldn't have had. We didn't

want him to for three reasons, really: Number one, because

if he took anything and it came to the attention of anybody,

he was no good as an informant anymore. We didn't want him to

do anything illegal. I personally didn't want him doing any-

thing illegal. The Bureau wouldn't have wanted him to, and I

didn't. He had been told before, and I reminded him of that

after this incident.

What the

cumstances were, I don'

know, but I told him

that we didn't want anything, like that again.

Mr. Oliphant.

Why didn't you want anything like that

again?

Mr. O'Connor.

Because I didn't think it was the type of

thing we should have.

Mr. Oliphant.

Why?

MI. O'Connor. Primarily because he shouldn't have had

things that really weren't intended for him or for the public.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you think they came from the trash?

Mr. O'Connor. I took his word for it, as I recall.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you write a report on this?

Mr. O'Connor. I wrote the - you mean describing the

way this happened?

Mr. Oliphant. Did you write a report saying you had re-

ceived material from him?

Mr. O'Connor.

yes.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you say he said they came from the

trash?

Mr. O'Connor. Not at that time; no.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you say how you got them?

MI. O'Connor. No.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you say that you réturned them?

Mr. O'Connor.

NO. :

Mr. Oliphant.

Mr. O'Connor. In that case I didn't think that we -- he

says it is trash; I will take his word for it. But if it is

trash and it belongs up there, then it should be back up there

in the trash can.

Mr. Oliphant. Have you ever returned anything to the

trash since? In other words, have you ever received anything

Mr. O'Connor. I have never received anything like that

again.

Mr. Oliptant. Do you know if getting information in any

kind of investigation from the trash, do you know if that is

a regular investigative technique employed by the FBI?

MI. O'Connor. I think it probably has been in the past.

But let me say that Merritt was

never told to take anything

from the trash.

Mr. Oliphant. All right.. Have you ever heard of anybody

returning things to the trash?

Mr. O'Connor. No, except in that instance, except that it!

bothered me to have that stuff in the first place.

Mr. Oliphant.

You have received other documents,

haven't you, from people - without giving the details - but

haven't your informants given you little memorandas and things

like that that they have taken from various places?

Or

didn't they in those days?

MI. O'Connor. You mean things for public -

Mr. Olishant. Have you ever heard of them being returned

afterwards?

MI. O'Connor. I don't know whether I have. I don't know

what kind of document we are talking about. Actually that is

speculation.

MI. Oliphant. Let's say memorandas?

Why weren't all the documents that were in this package

incorporated into the record - well, I say into the record,

why weren't they memorialized and incorporated in the files of

All right.

Mr. Oliphant.

Do you recognize that?

Mr. O'Connor.

I do.

MI. Oliphant. Look at the second page.

Mr. O'Connor.. Right.

Mr. Oliphant. Did that come from this alleged trash

collection?

Mr. O'Connor. No; it was separate and we felt -- this

was someching that was questionable. We felt the guy did

have the right to have it because he was up there all the time

and the thing was addressed to everyone, and I think there was

another one addressed to all, and it was nothing that was a

personal type memorandum. It appeared. to us to be something

that was intended for anybody who was up there.

Mr. Oliphant. Why did you put that into the files? Why

did you bother to incorporate that into the records at the FBI?

Mr. O'Connor. Basically because it was intelligence-type

information regarding IPS.

Mr. Oliphant. Are you stating that the other material

that was with this alleged trash collection was of even less

value than that?

Mr. O'Connor. It would have had to have been except for

the fact that this wasn't in the trash.

Mr. Oliphant. Did the fact that it was in the trash have

some sort of bearing over why you did not incorporate this into

the record?

• Mr. O'Connor.

First of

all, as I said, it was something

that we really didn't want... We didn't want it. And, I don't

know, perhaps — whether he did something illegal in taking

that thing or not, I seally didn't know. Whether taking it

from the trash was illegal or not, in my mind I wasn't sure.

Because of that, I did copy that one speech, but appar-

ently there was nothing else in the thing that would have been

worth copying, or it would have been copied.

Mr. Oliphant. You made no real report of this, did you,

that he had come to you with a package of material that he

alleged had come fron the trash?

MI. O'Connor. No; it isn't set forth that way, because wel

normally wouldn't. It is my understanding we wouldn't set forth

the fact that it came from a specific spot.

Mr. Oliphant. I am reading from a report by tucker, and

it is on 11/29/71, and says, "On 11/26/71, WF-4015-PCI --"

who I take it was Merritt; is that correct?

MI. O'Connor.

Right.

Mr. Oliphant. "-- telephonically advised Special Agent

Tucker and advised that he had viewed certain documents at the

Institute for Policy Studies", and then it lists three docu-

ments.

Let me show you a brief synopsis.

Would you say that is a standard sort of report?

reports. I mean you don't'do it as you see fit each time.

There is a form you follow, isn't there?

Mr. O'Connor. Usually. It could have been written up in

this form or on one of these --

Mr. Oliphant. You see

• the substance of this information

in the report, by Tucker?

Mr. O'Connor. Right.

Mr. Oliphant.

Was the information that was in the trash

envelope, was it even of less value than that?

Mr. O'Connor. I suppose it was because the only thing tha

we copied, or I copied, was that speech.

Mr. Oliphant. Were you entirely convinced that that came

from the trash?

Mr. O'Connor. I am going to have to - this is based on

my recollection. One hundred percent I don't think so; no.

didn't know. As I recall, he said it came from the trash,

and, as

I told you before, even when this issue first came up,

I had a heck of a lot of trouble remembering what the heck had

happened at that time.

Mr. Oliphant. But as you look back now, there was some

doubt in your mind at the time that it had actually come from

the trash, wasn't there?

word for it.

Mr. Oliphant.

But you were uncomfortable with it?

Mr. O'Connor. I wasn't very comfortable with it even if

it came from the trash.

I thought if it came from the trash,

he probably could have obtained it legally; still I din't

like the idea the man had

something -- I didn't like the

idea of rummaging around in the trash, even.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you and Agent Tucker discuss this

transaction?

MI. O'Connor. Yes.

Mr. Oliphant. What did you say to each other? What was

the substance of your discussion?

Mr. O'Connor. Basically he told me about these things

because if I am --

Mr. Oliphant. Excuse me. Did you discuss the trash

collection venture?

Mr. O'Connor. Yes.

Mr. Oliphant. And what did you decide between the two

of you? What did you say?

Mr. O'Connor. In terms of whether. it had actually come

from the trash?

Mr. Oliphant. Did you discuss whether or not to make a

report of it?

MI. O'Connor: No. .

Mr. Oliphant. :

Was it normal for Tucker to make a report

there that the guy had advised him of those three items?

Mr. O'Connor. Yes.

Mr. Oliphant. Then why wouldn't it have been normal for

you to make a report of the information you received?

Mx. O'Connor. Well, the report would simply have been,

I guess - I think I wrote something up on that speech that we

copied, and I guess that would have been the report if there

is a report, based on what is in the files and what I can recalf.

Mr. Oliphant. Do you have further questions?

Mr. Atkisson. Just one not on this subject.

Mr. O'Connor, am I right in assuming that you were more

or less in charge of Merritt; you were the primary contact man

with Merritt?

Mr. O'Connor. Yes.

Mr. Atkisson. Would any other special agent have had con-

tact with Merritt without your knowledge?

Mr. O'Connor. Not that I know of.

Mr. Atkisson. Well, not that you know of, but would it

have been incorrect for some other special agent of the Bureau

to

have contact without your knowing it?

Mr. O'Connor. Yes; he probably would have told me.

contact with

Yes, he did; I think on one occasion.

Mr. Atkisson.

Fet me ask you this: I believe your contact

with Merritt ran from November of 1971 to May of 1972?

Mr. O'ConnoI. Or early June; yes.

Mr. Atkisson. He was terminated, then, in May of 1972?

Mr. O'Connor.

Yes, or right at the beginning of June.

MI. Atkisson. Mr. Feuer was assigned to the IPS investi-

gation in July of 1972?

Mr. O'Connor. Right.

Mr. Atkisson. So what you are saying is that any contact

Mx. Feuer had with MI. Merritt would have been prior to his

assignment to the IPS investigation? •

Mr. O'Connor. Yes; as I recall, the one time that I can

recall that Bob Feuer talked to Merritt, he was with us --

of with myself, I don't know whether Bill was along - and it

was during the time - sometime between -- it might have had

something to do with the Jack Davis or Capitol bombing investi-

gation.

Mr. Oliphant.

Just one last thing on these things. Did

Tucker tell you how he got the documents, or whatever you want

to call it, the trash collection?

Mr. O'Connor.

I know that he met Merritt some place - I

guess it was Lafayette Park, or some place like that, as I

recall, and he got them from him there.

When the Jack

Mr. O'Connor. Starting with about June, 1973, we have

been talking to people. We have talked to Bureau investigators,

and we have talked to the Metropolitan Police Department.

Mr. Oliphant. Did the Bureau investigators ask you why

you returned the material?

Mr. O'Connor. I can't recall. That was something that I

did on my own. You know, whether somebody else would have done

that or not, I don't know. We hadn't known Merritt for very

long at that time, and I really wasn't sure of what was going

on there.

TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM TIMOTHY TUCKER, SPECIAL AGENT:

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Mr. Tucker. I entered on duty with the FBI on March 17,.

1969. After a four-month training perioa, I was assigned to

the Jacksonville Division, which covers the Northern District

of Florida.

I was subsequently appointed within the division to work

in the Fort Walton Beach, Florida, resident agency, and I

stayed there until roughly between August 19, 1969, and

October 28, 1970, and approximately on the Ist of November,

1970, I reported to the Washington Field Office of the FBI.

I have been at the Washington Field Office for almost five!

years exactly. During that time, I have worked on - would you!

Like me to go into my work?

MIt.

Oliphint. Yes, I would.

Mr. Tucker. Initially, I worked on background investiga-

tions for a period of approximately five months. In March of

1971, I would say, I was assigned to work on the May Day,

covering the May

Day demonstrations. Subsequently, I was re-

assigned to the squad which handled - previously I had been

temporarily assigned there -- I was permanently assigned to the

squad handling domestic intelligence and remained there until

August, 1974, and then transferred to work in organized

crime special, and in March of this year, I was reassigned

again, and now I am working violations of the Federal Escape

and Rescue Statutes and bank robbery.

Mr. Oliphant. Prior to your stint with the domestic

intelligence group, had you ever had any prior contact

officially with the new left or with the radical movement?

Mr. Tucker. Would you clarify that?

Mr. Oliphant. As an FBI agent, had you ever been

assigned to investigate radical movements, subversive move-

ments?

Mr. Tucker. Prior to coming to Washington?

MI. Oliphant. Prior to coming to Washington, D. C.

Mr. Tucker. No, I had not.

Mr. Oliphant. What specific squads were you working on

when you worked on the domestic intelligence assignments?

Mr. Tucker. It was one squad and designated in the

Washington Field Office of the FBI as S-7, "s" standing for

security, seven meaning the 7th Security Squad,

seven out of

nine.

Mr. Oliphant.

Seven out of nine squads in the Washington

Field Office, or seven out of nine security squads?

Mr. Tucker. Seven out of nine security squads and C-squads

for criminal and "A" for applicants.

Mr. Oliphant. What was S-7 assigned to do?

Mr. Tucker. Primarily we were assigned to investigate

those persons and/or groups who posed - we had

legalistic

terms, and I am trying to come up with that - who could

possibly be involved in those acts which would consist in

espionage, sedition, sabotage, of disruption in the normal

functions of the United States

Government.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you have a number of targets you were

looking at?

Mr. Tucker. When I was assigned to the S-7 squad, my

work, however -- we had a two-fold responsibility on the squad.

We were also assigned certain criminal violations. The work

I did was ninety-nine percent criminal. The investigations I

was conducting were unlawful flight to avoid prosecution inves

tigations and anti-riot law investigations.

What we did was we broke the squad into a sub-squad.

Mr. O'Connor, myself, and two other agents were assigned to

fugitives.

lis Oliphant. Were there intelligence targets that

were designated groups and individuals who were considered

subversive to go

along with the legalistic definition you

were groping for?

Mr. Tucker. Before I go into that, when I was sent up

here, I had to consult with the Legal Division, and I was

given the agreement which we signed with the FBI regarding

confidentiality, and I was told that agreement was only waived

vis-a-vis my dealings with Earl Robert Merritt, and I was not

to discuss anything which involved one, ongoing investigations;

two, anything which would endanger an FBI source; of, three,

any information which would jeopardize third-party sources.

Mr. Oliphant. Mr. Tucker, all we are asking for now is

we are trying to get the Merritt investigation into proper

perspective. We are not asking for something which would

reveal a source or reveal an ongoing investigation, or put

anyone in jeopardy.

What we are asking for is, were there targets?

You don't

have to tell us what they were.

Were there targets, intelli-

gence targets?

Mr. Tucker. Targets?

Mr. Tucker. May I ask Mr. Flannagan if he thinks that

would be an appropriate question for me to address myself to?

N=. Flannagan. Off the record, please.

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Tucker. There were cases opened on various groups

and individuals.

Mr. Oliphant. Was one of these groups the IPS?

Mr. Tucker. Yes.. By IPS, YOU mean the Institute for

Policy Studies?

Mr. Oliphant. That is correct.

Now, who designated the IPS as a target, or, if you know,

how was the investigation opened on that?

Mr. Tucker. My involvement with the Institute of Policy

Studies was not -- I was not involved in investigating the

Institute of Policy Studies.

Mr. Oliphant. Were you interested in certain individuals

who were in the Institute for Policy Studies?

Mr. Tucker. No, I wasn't. In the sense that I was not

tasked with the case assignment if there were cases on the

individuals. I was not tasked with that responsibility of

investigating the institution or any case on individuals.

Mr. Oliphant. What was your interest with the IPS, then?

Mr. Tucker. Any violation of the Federal Harboring

MI. Tucker.

I was the alternate agent on a case, an

case in which he was the informant with whom we were

dealing. Mr. O'Connor was the case agent.

Mr. Oliphant. Did he become an informant for the Bureau?

Mr. Tucker. Yes, he did.

informant?

Mr. Tucker. No.

person goes through before they can be qualified as an informant

for the Bureau?

MI. Tucker. Again, I don't think I can go into our

I am not trying to make you give away the crown

Okay.

Mr. Oliphant. Is one of the bases of the investigation,

for want of a better word, the process to make sure that the

informant is reliable? That would be one of the things you

would be looking for; is that correct?

Mr. Tucker. Of course.

Mx. Oliphant. Did you know that he had been an informant

for the Metropolitan Police Department?

Mr. Tucker.

yes.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you check with the Metropolitan Police

Department to find out if he had been reliable?

Mr. Tucker.

I did not check.

Mr. Oliphant. Do you know if anyone checked?

•Mr. Tucker. No, I do not know that.

Mr. Oliphant. Do you know why not?

Mr. Tucker. No, I don't know why not, but I would like

to comment on that.

Ms. Oliphant. Certainly.

Mr. lucker. I knew the individual who operated him at

the Metropolitan Police Department and informally discussed the

fact that he had been released by him and now we were operating

him, so it wasn't that we weren't aware of why he left them

and came to us.

MI. Oliphant. Did you, during your informal conversations,

ever ask if he had been reliable?

Mr. Tucker. I don't think the specific question of

reliability was raised.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you ever ask what sort of activities hel.

had been performing for the Metropolitan Police Department?

Mr. Tucker. This is an area you don't get into.

When

you are talking to another agent regarding dealing with a

source, you would not broach those kinds of subjects, because

those are sacrosanct.

Mr. Oliphant. So it is safe to say you were not apprised

of what kind of activity he had been doing with the Metropoli-

tan Police Department?

Mr. Tucker. From the Metropolitan Police Department. .

Mr. Oliphant. Did you receive information from any other

source as to what sort of activity he had been doing?

Mr. Tucker. From Merritt, himself.

Mr. Oliphant. What did Meritt tell you he had been doing

with the Metropolitan Police Department?

Mr. Tucker. Again, I was the alternate agent, and my

information will not be as complete as Mr. O'Connor's, because

• he was primarily responsible, although we worked as partners,

and would often, in face-to-face dealings with Merritt, I

would say almost ninety-nine

percent of the time, we were there

phone I would say on about an 80-20 basis regarding, if you

had to average it out how many times they talked; so getting

back to your question, I would say we knew that he had dealt

with the Institute for Policy Studies prior to coming with us

and had done some work on the gathering of intelligenc: on

the activities of those people who had come to washington to

participate in the May Day demonstrations.

Mr. Oliphant. Did he ever tell you that he had performed

any breakins for the Metropolitan Police Department?

Mr. Tucker. • No, he did not.

Mr. Oliphant. Did he ever tell you he had taken mate-

rials from various organizations for the Metropolitan Police

' Department?

Mr. Tucker. No, he did not.

MI. Oliphant. Did anyone ever tell you either of those

two facts?

Mr. Tucker.

No one ever told me that.

Mr. Atkisson. How about the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,

and Firearms?

Mr. Tucker. No one, to include anyone.

Mr. Atkisson. Were you aware of any connection between

Earl Robert Merritt, Jx., and ATF?

• Mr. Tucker. Yes, the details of which I cannot recall

now. I think he had dealt with an Agent Seals at one time.

Mr. Tucker. I dealt with Merritt, I would say, between

the beginning of November, 1971, until the end of May, 1972.

Mr. Oliphant. Did there come a time in November, 1971,

Merritt delivered to you

any material that he had acquired

from the IPS?

Mr. Tucker.

Yes.

My. Oliphant. Would you describe each one of these incidents,

to the best of your recollection?

MI. Tucker. There is only one incident. On approxi-

mately the 26th of Novembes, I believe that was a Wednesday eve

ing,

he called, and he said -

Mr. Oliphant. where were you?

MI. Tucker. He called our office, who called me to let me

know he had called, and he left a number. So I called him

back, and he said he had obtained some materials from the trash

at IPS. This was, I believe, the wednesday before Thanksgiving,

and that Friday I met with him in Lafayette Park, and he turned

over those items to me consisting of a manila envelope with

papers in it. It appeared to me that it did come from the

trash.

Mr. Oliphant. Why do you say that?

Mr. Tucker. There were crumpled message slips, and the

items appeared soiled, as I recoliect. I believed it had

come from the trash.

Mr. Tucker. No. Again, there was no inventory made of

these items.

Mr. Oliphant. When he called you on the phone, did you

ask him to look at any of the postmarks on the letters?

Mr. Tucker. There was no discussion of letters.

Mr. Oliphant. There was no discussion at all regarding

the substance of the letters; is that correct? Or the substance

of the materials he had taken?

Mr. Tucker. There may have been, but I cannot recall the

substance of it. I do recall he has made certain allegations

that I ordered him to open mail he had found. I dia not do

that. There was no discussion of any mail in those materials.

I assume that these were items he found in the trash, and

again there was no discussion of that.

your voice for comparison with a tape, if that were asked of

you?

No.

One glaring occasion he mentioned the fact

that some prominent people he knew were being extorted because

of homosexuality.

Inasmuch as this was totally unfounded

rumor, he could not in any way substantiate or corroborate the

information, we took no action.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you subsequently investigate to find

out if this was true or not; search the record?

all?

Mr. Tucker. No.

Mr. Oliphant. Do you know if he was told he was not

is that this was a decision made by the local United States

Attorney of the local state's attorney, whichever the case

may be.

did you ever have any other sources or informants or people

who gave you information at the same time within the homo-

sexual community, other people, other than Merritt?

talk to who was an informant of mine, and I may have on one

occasion or two occasions, without indicating to this individual

my relationship with Merritt, ask him, "What is his story?"

and never went into any detailed inquiry regarding this

individual's knowledge of Merritt. In fact, he told me that

he basically knew that Merritt lived in the area.

Mx. Oliphant. During the time when you were working with

Merritt, how were you dressed? How did you come to work?

Mr. Tucker. I was dressed very casually, jeans, blue work-

shirt, had long, shoulder-length hair, and full beard.

Mr. Tucker. The Special Agent in charge.

Mr. Oliphant. Were you requested to dress like this?

Mr. Tucker. Then let me put it this way: When you say

report, within the FBI a report is a compilation of information

which is received and written by the case agent. In this

case it would have been the case agent on the IPS case. I

do not know if the case agent ever compiled anything from what

he had given me and put it in the report.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you show this material to the case

agent?

Mr. Tucker. No, I did not.

Mr. Oliphant. Do you know if O'Connor showed it to the

case agent?

Mr. Tucker. I do not know.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you copy any of the material and

memorialize it in writing in any way, shape, or form?

Mr. Tucker. I did not, but MI. O'Connor, I understand,

did regarding a speech which was given by a Mr. Wolfson at

the Peoples Grand Jury.

Mr. Oliphant. This speech was found in the garbage, the

Wolfson speech?

Mr. Tucker.

Yes.

Mc. Oliphant. Why was that put in the report, or why was

that memorialized and put in the files?

Mr. Tucker. I do not know.

Mr. Oliphant. Do you know of anything else?

Mr. Tucker. No, I do not.

Mr. Oliphant. Dian't you state that the reason

that you

were interested in IPS and in having Mezritt there was that

basically you were looking for fugitives; is that correct?

Mr. Tucker. This is correct.

Mr.. Oliphant. Let me show you this memorandum.

Mr. Tucker.

All right. I have seen this before.

Mr. Oliphant.

Okay. Just for the record, I have shown

Agent Tucker a memorandum of two pages. The first page is

an FBI report giving a date of contact 11/26/71. The second

page is a memorandum dealing with IPS agenda.

What, if anything, did this have to do with fugitives?

Mr. Tucker. What did that have to do with fugitives?

Nothing.

Mr. Oliphant.

Why did you put it in the files?

. Why were you interested in that?

Mr. Tucker. I didn't put it in the files.

Let me

explain. Mr. O'Connor put it in the file. It was information

about IPS. There was 'a case on IPS.

We thought that the

case agent might be

interested in that kind of information.

Flanagan

Who was the case agent, incidentally?

Mr.

Tucker. There were numerous case agents. I cannot

recall who the case agent was. ' At this time I would not

know.

I can check for you.

Mr. Oliphant. Do you know what the subject matter

of the investigation was? You don't-have to go into detail.

Was the subject matter subversion?

Mr. Tucker. Yes.

Mr.. Oliphant. I'm showing Mr. Tucker a memorandum dated

November 29, 1971.

Mr. Tucker. That is correct.

Mr. Oliphant. Now, could you tell us what, if anything,

that memorandum has to do with subversion or with fugitives?

Mr. Tucker. It has nothing to do with subversion or

fugitives.

Mr. Oliphant. Why was that incorporated into the files?

Mr. Tucker. Because it would give the FBI some idea of

how this organization was operating.

Mr. Oliphant. Agent Tucker, the second page of this,

this page is deleted in its entirety. Now without going

into details of what was in that page, do you recall the

content of that page?

Mr. Tucker. I could not hazard a guess at this point.

Mr. Oliphant. Do you recall or does it appear likely

to you that this might have been a document that as

taken from IPS oI do you feel it was something, some subjective

writing that you made?

Mr. White.

Could we go off the record on this?

Mr. Oliphant. Sure.

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Oliphant. All right. The question is, was the

second page which is deleted in its entirety, a document

of some sort taken from the Institute of Policy Studies,

to the best of your recollection?

Mr. Tucker. It would not have been.

Mr. Oliphant. Is it fair to say, then, that this page

would have been some report that you made on the basis of

some sort of independent investigation?

Mr. Tucker.

Yes.

Mr. Oliphant. Would it be fair to say that this probably

had to do with the Institute of Policy Studies?

Mr. Tucker. Yes.

Mr. Oliphant. Would you describe now in detail what happened

when Earl Robert

Merritt was terminated,

as best as you

remember it, the day of his termination?

Mr. Tucker. I don't recall the exact date.

I do

recall we picked him up and drove him to a secluded spot

in Rock Creek Park. It was not a secluded spot, I cannot

remember the exact street. It is where there is an old mill

and there is a dam there. It is not Fletcher's, the name

the mill. That escapes me now. We confronted him with the

information that we believed that he was lying us.

He denied it. Admittedly there were heated words

between us. He was never physically abused or things like

that. I was upset at the time.

I was rather firm with

• Merritt but I don't believe abusive. .

Mr. Oliphant. How upset were you?

Mr. Tucker. That would be hard to describe.

Mr. Oliphant. Well, describe your actions and describe

what you said.

Mr. Tucker. I think the strongest thing I did was pound

on the picnic table and call him a liar.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you threaten him in any way,

shape, or form?

Mr. Tucker. Absolutely not.

Mr. Oliphant. When you say you were firm, what were

you firm about?

trying to cover this up with an additional lie.

Mr. Oliphant. Did it then become apparent to you that

maybe some of the other information he had given to yo: was

also not true?

Mr. Tucker.

YeS.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you ever make a report in a sense,

in essence, correcting the previous erroneous information

• that had been incorporated in the FBI files?

Mr. Tucker. I had made no such report. I had no informa-

tion as to which information he had given me was erroneous.

Mr. Oliphant.

Did you ever maké a report or notation or

any sort of memorialized writing that it now appeared

that some of the information that had been given in the

past by this informant -

Mr. Tucker. I did not. Mr. O'Connor did.

Mr. Oliphant. What did he say, to the best of your

recollection?

Mr. Tucker. To the best of my recollection it was

that we have received information, I am trying to get the

exact words as best I can -- that Merritt -- I guess "unreliabla"

was the word we used, was "unreliable."

Mr. Oliphant. Did you and O'Connor in a sense

make chis retroactive? I am sure you said he was unreliable

regarding a specific instance that you could prove,

Mr. Oliphant. Did you then say, these would not be .

your exact words, but this may now put in jeopardy or ast

aspersions on some of the prior information which he has

given to us? Did you make any notation to that effect?

Mr. Tucker. I did not.

. Mr. Oliphant. Do you know if Agent O'Connor did?

Mx. Tucker. As far as I know he did not. Normally what

would be done in a case like this would be that in the

future communications dealing with him, this would be

pointed out, "He has been shown to be unreliable in the past."

Mr. Oliphant. How many reports, roughly, did you

write based on information which he had given you over the

time that you were handling.

Mr. Tucker. I did not handle it. Mr. O'Connor wrote

about 95 percent of the reports.

Mx. Oliphant. How many of those reports were written,

roughly?

Mr. Tucker. All reports were written.

Mr. Oliphant. How many, roughly?.

Mr. Tucker. Again, when you are using the word

"report" generically, contacts would be our in-house term.

guess,

somewhere between 100 and 200--maybe not that

high;

maybe 100. That is a ballpark figure.

Mr. Oliphant. On how many individuals, again a ballpark

figure, was he supplying information?

Mr. Tucker.

Maybe 25.

Mr. Oliphant. How much money did you pay him or

did the Bureau pay him over the time that he was working

with the Bureau?

Mr. Tucker. I never have conducted an audit.

I think it may have been somewhere around fifteen to seventeen

hundred dollars, in that figure.

Mr. Oliphant. Would that include both payments and

expenses or was there any differentiation made?

Mr. Tucker. There is a differentiation. I think that

would be a cumulative amount.

Mr. Oliphant. What sort of expenses would he have?

What would be his expenses?

Mr. Tucker. Expenses would be actual, anything he

would have to pay out of his pocket.

My. Oliphant. Was he paid on a regular basis?

Mr. Tucker. No. He was paid on a c.o.d. basis.

Mr. Oliphant. What was about the most money that he

was ever given at one time?

Mr. Tucker. Again I am guessing, $100.

That is the upper limit.

Mr. Oliphant. Isn't it true that when you pay

an informant you have to justify this in writing

internally in the Bureau?

Mr. Tucker. That is affirmative.

Mr. Oliphant. Now when you justified this, did you

have to qualify Merritt as a reliable informant?

Mr. Tucker. I don't think, I don't know if I wrote

any of those requests for payments. I may have written one.

I don't really know. You have to justify your requests,

though, when you do make such an application, yes.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you see any justifications for Merritt

that either you or O'Connor wrote?

Mr. Tucker. Yes.

Mr. Oliphant. What did you say in those?

Mr. Tucker. Do you want me to give you an outline

of how these go? I cannot reply specifically. It runs something

like this. "During the period of so and so to such and such

captioned source provided information on the following

matters." Then you list them and give a brief capsule

of the information which he provided. In the body you

would say "It is therefore requested that the captioned

source be paid so much and then you break it down if

there were expenses, for the information he has provided.

That memorandum then would go to the special agent in charge

who would have to approve it along with some other papers

which go along with that which are for handling the

money.

Mr. Oliphant.

Agent Tucker, there has to be some

sort of subjective analysis of yours that, or whoever is

preparing the voucher that he is reliable, that it is good

information.

Mr. Tucker.

You would not utilize reliability as a

criterion at this time. This is done in semi-annual letters

regarding your informant and/or initial justifications.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you write a semi-annual letter?

Mr. Tucker. I did not.

Mr. Oliphant. Did O'Connor?

Mr. Tucker. He may have. I don't know. He would have,

when you convert someone from a potential informant to

a full-fledged informant the question of reliability

would have to be established.

Mr. Oliphant. Was that written?

Mr. Tucker. Yes.

Mr. Oliphant. What was said about Merritt?

Mr. Tucker. Based on the information we knew he was

reliable.

Mr. Oliphant. I just have one further question.

Regarding all the materials which were handed over in

November of 1971, in the packet which allegedly came from

the trash, we take it these were quite extensive, that there

was a

lot of stuff in there, is that correct?

. Mr. Tucker. Again, there was no inventory made.

If I had to hazard a guess, again, it probably would not

equal more than what you have in front of you right there.

Mr. Oliphant. Why were only certain things inco porated?

Why didn't they incorporate everything?

Mr. Tucker. I didn't make the determination as to

what was going to be maintained and what was going to be

copied. So I cannot really say what the motivation was.

Again, it appears to me that the items which were maintained

were background information regarding IPS and its internal

operations.

Mi. Oliphant. My question to you is: Referring to

the November 29, 1971 memoranda that you were shown,

this states that you were telephonically advised about

three items which you stated had no real value substantively

to either a subversive or a fugitive investigation.

Now they were written down as background information.

My question to you is: If you thought these were significant

enough to put in, coming to you over the telephone, are you

saying that the other information that you got from

-the trash there was even less interesting, or of lesser

value than this sort of information which you did see fit

to incorporate?

Mr. Tucker. In retrospect, I would have to say yes.

Again --

Mr. Oliphant. Was it ever written in a report that

you had received information from Merritt that allegedly

came

from the trash? Did that ever come in a report?

Mr. Tucker. I don't believe so. Again, I did not have the

case assigned to me and do not know if the case agent

who was writing the reports --

Mr. Oliphant. Wouldn't that be normal, to state how

you got the information?

Mr. Tucker.

The way it would be set out would be

something along this line. On such and such a day such

and such a source provided the following.

Mr. Oliphant. I have no further questions.

Agent Tucker, I think you indicated

earlier in this interview that your dealing with Robert

Merritt was from roughly November, 1971, through May of

1972, is that correct?

Mr. Tucker. Correct.

Mr. Flannagan. Did your involvement with the investigation

of IPS coincide with those dates? In other words, after May

of 1972, were you involved in an investigation of IPS?

Mr. Tucker.

I would have channeled to those agents.

I am speaking of you, Mr. O'Connor, and Mr. Feuer, were

as being developed by one agent?

Mr. Tucker. Yes. Mr. O'Connor was what we term the case

agent.

Concerning Robert Merritt?

Right.

Merritt independent of O'Connor;.

want to discuss this sort of thing at 18th and I. In other

words, there would be privacy there. That is a better

word than anonymity:

Mr. Flannagan•

Where did you pick him up?

Mr. Tucker. I don't recall. We usually would pick him

up around 22nd and Massachusetts, and that area, Sheraton

Circle.

Mr.

Flannagan: Who did you regard as your supervisor with

respect

to

any of your investigative endeavors in connection

with IPS?

Mr. Tucker. Well, the entire time I was assigned to the

S-7 squad my supervisor was John R. Palmer.

Mr. Flannagan.,

Did MI. Palmer specifically verbally or in

writing authorize the investigation of IPS?

Mx. Tucker.. There was a case opened on IPS. I

don't know whether it was opened during Mr. Palmer's tenure

or not.

Mr. Flannagan:

Were you aware, when Mr. Merritt began

giving you information concerning IPS, were you aware of the

nature of his first contact with IPS?

Mr. Tucker.

No. I don't know how he first came to know

them or they came to know him. I do not know that.

Mr. Tucker.

He said that they had become extremely

any contact with IPS.

Community Book Store, that you never..

to your knowledge, never received anything from that

establishment.

Mx.. Tucker.

That is correct.

Mr.

Flannagan,

You never received any petitions,

membership lists, literature?

Mr. Tucker. To my knowledge at this point, no.

I

may have because he would often come in with literature

announcing demonstrations and the like.

Now he gave, and it may have been reported that he gave

us information from the Community Book Store, but at this

point I don't know.

Mr. Oliphant. Mr. Tucker, let me ask you this: what

did you do with all the documents you got, allegedly from

the trash, the middle of November? What happened to them?

Mr. Tucker.

We gave them back to Mc. Merritt and he

was told to take them back to IPS. He got them from the

trash and that is where they belonged.

Mx. Oliphant. Is that usual, to return things

to the trash?

Mr. Tucker. again we were not too sure about that

situation. The legal question of abandonment is really not

a very settled one.

Mr. Oliphant. Have you ever returned anything to the

trash before?

Mr. Tucker.

That is the only time I ever got anything

from the trash.

Mx. Oliphant. Have you ever heard of people returning

things to the trash after they used them, agents?

Mr. Tucker. No, I haven't.

Mr. Oliphant. Why were they returned, why were these

documents returned to Merritt?

Mr. Tucker. Again, because we weren't very sure of the ques

tion of abandonment in this case.

Mr. Oliphant. You weren't suce they had been abandoned?

Mr. Tucker. No. We weren't

sure of the law on

abandonment.

Mr. Oliphant. Are you not sure of the word "abandonment"

or were you not sure they had been abandoned?

Mr. Tucker. I had no reason to doubt that he got

them from the trash at that time.

Can I answer that way?

Mr. Oliphant. Sure.

Mr. Tucker. If that satisfies your question.

Mr. Oliphant. Did you return any other documents to

him?

Mr. Tucker.

NO.

Mr. Oliphant. Then why did you return these?

Mr. Tucker. Because we weren't sure if we should

have had them.

Mr. Oliphant.

Why?

Mr. Tucker.

Because they had come, he said they had

from the trash. Again, we weren't too sure about the

law of abandonment, whether of not we could have them.

Mr. Oliphant. Is acquiring documents from the trash

or evidence from the trash an investigative technique employed

by the FBI?

Mr. Tucker.

Yes.

Mr. Oliphant. Had you heard of this technique being

used before you received these documents from the trash?

Mr. Tucker. Yes.

Mr. Oliphant. Have you heard of it being used since you

received these documents from the trash?

Mr. Tucker. Yes.

Mx. Oliphant. And at any other time have you ever

heard of documents being returned back to the trash?

Mr. Tucker. No.

Mr. Oliphant. Do you recail if there was a manuscript

in these documents?

Mr. Tucker. No.

Mr. Oliphant. You don't remember, or there wasn't?

Mr. Tucker. I don't remember.

MI. Oliphant. What sort of container were these

documents in, or these materials, whatever you want to call

them?

Mr. Tucker. A manilla envelope.

Legal Counsel

U.S. RECORDING COMPANY;

HOUSE SELECT CONVITTEE

At 3:00 p.m. on November 20, 1975, Joe Tait, U.S. Recording

Company, telephonically advised me that he has been requested to

appear for a staff interview by representatives of captioned committee

at 11:00 a.m. on November 21, 1975, at which time he anticipates being

served with a subpoena requiring him to produce his records concerning

dealings with the Martin Kaiser Company. Mir. Tait requested advice

concerning an appropriate response to the demand for his records. He

said that the records that would be involved in the demand are all classified

and he regarded that classification as binding. I told Mir. Tait that in view

of the fact the documents were classified, it would be necessary for the

matter to be presented to the Department for a determination as to

declassification of the documents or for the development of procedures

for submission of the documents to the Committee in classified form.

Mr. Tait interrupted me and said that he would prefer that I

furnish this information to his attorney and he requested me to call

Bryan Gettings at telephone number 525-2260.

I called Bryan Gettings and advised him of Ir. Tait's request that

I inform him of the difficulties involved in responding to a subpoena for

the production of documents where the documents involved are classified.

I told Vir. Gettings that it would be necessary for the fact that the subpoena

was issued for classified documents to be brought to the attention of the

Department for possible declassification or for the development of appropriate

procedures for submission of classified documents to the Committee.

• Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: U.S. Recording Company

I also told Mir. Gettings that it would be appropriate for him to

alert the Committee staff to the problems involved in supplying the

Commitee with documents that are classified. Itold Mr Gettings that

I would not counsel him as to what advice he should give his client, but

the determination would be entirely his.

Mr. Gettings considered the matter briefly and then told me that

he would advise Mr. Tait to appear in response to the subpoena, but

to take no documents with him. Further, he would advise Mr. Tait

to explain to the Committee staff that the documents are all classified

and that they would continue to respect the limitations imposed on disclosure

of that information due to the classification. He also would advise the

Committee staff that should the Committee desire to inquire further concerning

the documents that such inquiries should be made directly to the Department

of Justice. He said that he would not communicate with the Department of

Justice directly at this time concerning this matter, but would leave such

communication up to the Committee staff.

Upon completion of my discussion with Mr. Gettings, I telephonically

advised Mr. Callahan and Mr. Bassett of the results. Mr. Callahan inquired

concerning the current validity of the classification of the documents.

I discussed that matter with Mir. Bassett who advised me that the

classification of the documents had previously been reviewed and found to be

valid. I requested Mr. Bassett to verify that information in light of the

fact that he advised me the classification may have been based on purchasing

regulations rather than Executive Order 11652. Further, Itold Mr. Bassett

that it may be necessary for the Bureau to be prepared to submit the documents

to the Departmental Review Committee for a determination as to whether

the documents should be declassified for purposes of responding to the

subpoena.

At approximately 4:15 p.m., Mr. Daly advised me that Tim Oliphant,

of the House Select Committee, called and requested the Bureau to authorize

Mr. Tait to release the documents to the Committee in view of Mr. Tait's

reluctance to do so based on their classification. I directed Mr. Daly to

call Oliphant and respond to his request by telling him that the documents

were classified and request Oliphant to permit us an opportunity to review

•Re: U.S. Recörding Company

the documents to determine the validity of the classification and to make

any necessary special arrangements for their delivery such as excision

of sensitive material.

Mr. Daly discussed this matter with Mr. Oliphant and then advised

me that Oliphant was agreeable to changing the time of the testimony from

11:00 a.m. on November 21st, to the late afternoon of November 21st,

and further that he was agreeable to having the documents reviewed and

sensitive information concerning the subjects of the purchases deleted.

Oliphant indicated that they were principally interested in the amounts

of the purchases and not the subject matter of the purchases.

I called Bryan Gettings at approximately 4:30 p.m. and told him

that the Committee staff had agreed to postpone the appearance to permit

the Bureau an opportunity to review the records and to make necessary

excisions concerning sensitive information describing the materials

purchased. I also explained to Mr. Gettings that due to arrangements

between the Department of Justice and the Committee, classified documents

were made available on Committee request. Therefore, I asked Mr. Gettings

for an opportunity to have the Bureau review the documents he was holding

for Mr. Tait in order for necessary excisions to be made prior to Mr. Tait's

appearance in response to the Committee request. I told him that the

Bureau was not in a position to direct Mr. Tait to decline to appear or to

produce the documents based simply on the fact that they were classified, but

that we did have an agreement with Mr. Oliphant that we would be permitted

to excise certain portions.

Mr. Gettings told me that he understood the limitations under which

the Bureau had to respond to Committee requests, and that he would

agree to have a Bureau representative review the doeuments and make

necessary excisions. However, he said that he was not bound by any

agreements with the Committee or by arrangements by the Attorney General

and that he did not feel that Mr. Tait or he should be inconvenienced by the

Committee unnecessarily. Therefore, he may advise Mr. Tait to decline

to appear until the first part of Lecember, 1975.

He said that he had determined that the Committee could not have

a subpoena issued and served on Mir. Tait prior to that time. Mr. Gettings

said that he would contact Mr. Oliphant, discuss the proposals, and advise

me of his decision.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: U.S. Recording Company

I called Assistant Director Cochran and alerted him to the fact

that it may be necessary on the morning of November 21st for Laboratory

representatives to review the documents being held by Mr. Gettings

in order to make necessary excisions of sensitive information. He agreed

that he and William Harward of the Laboratory would be available for that

purpose and he requested that Mr. Iseehan of the Inspection Division contact

him to make necessary arrangements.

I advised Mr. Keehan that Mr. Gettings had agreed to make the

documents available for Bureau review and that he should be available

on the morning of November 21st to review the documents for purposes

of the current Inspection Division inquiry. If this arrangement can be

made it will be possible for the Inspection Division to have accessto the

documents before they are submitted to the Committee and perhaps become

unavailable for our review. Mr. Keehan indicated he would be available

on November 21st.

At 5:20 p.m., Mr. Gettings called me and invited a representative

of the Bureau to come to his office at 1400 North Uhle Street located at

Court House Square in Arlington, Virginia, to pick up the records in

question and transport them to Bureau Headquarters for review and

appropriate excision. He said that he had contacted the Committee staff

and they have agreed that Mr. Tait will appear Friday, November 2tst,

without his records but to discuss the purchase arrangements with the FBI

and with Martin Kaiser. He said that the Committee staff agreed to this

arrangement for the interview on the 21st, but it may be that the Committee

will insist upon production of the recoras at a later time. I advised

Mr. Bassett and Mr. Keehan of the Inspection Division and requested

Mr. Keehan to pick up the records at Mr. Gettings' office at 10:00 a.m.

on November 2ist.

I advised Mr. Cochan: that the records will be available in the

Bureau and requested him to confer with Mr. Keehan and to arrange for

appropriate excision and he agreed.

RE:

INFORMATION CONCERNING

BARI, ROBENT MERRITT, JR.

Reference is nade to ISC letter dated ectober 28,

1975, which equests, bart vetee to a and ala

This Fureau is becoming concerned about the HSC

practice of submitting requests for all information in

Bureau files concerning named indivicuals, with no indication

as to the reason for the inquiry. As the ISC is aware,

this Dureau has, at one time of another, maintained a

confidential relationship with many of the individuals

named in prior ISG requests, primarily in requests dated

September 24, 1975, October 3, 1975, and lovember 4, 1975.

It has been this Bureau's understanding that in responding

to HSC requests, this Bureau would not be forced to divulge

the identity of

its sources. This Bureau feels it 18

essential, therefore, to meet with ISC representatives for

the purpose of formulating guidelines for future handling

of requests pertaining to individuals. It would be appre-

clated if the HSC would contact the Bureau Ilaison agent

with the HSO for the purpose of arranging requested meeting.

NOTE:

Earl Robert Merritt, JY., was a paid criminal

informant of the Washington Field Office from 10/1/71 until

he was discontinued 6/1/72 as doubt had been cast upon his

credibility.

Merritt has subsequently made unfounded alle

gations of having engaged in illegal tactics in the Bureau's

behalf and has also alleged improper conduct on the part of

handling Agents. These allegations have been refuted in

affidavits submitted by concerned personnel. Merritt

furnished information to this Bureau concerning Institute

for Policy Studies (IPS) which was under investigation during

the period he was an informant.

This response to HSC request has been coordinated

with Assistant Director John A. kintz, Legal Counsel

Division.

Above-mentioned HSC letter of 9/24/75 requested

access to material relating to six individuals, one of whom

is a current informant. HSC was granted access to material

relating to the five Bureau informants and was confidentially

advised of the informant status of the sixth, and no material

RE :

SECURITY INDEX (SI) AND

ADMINISTRATIVE INDEX (ADEX)

order for the HSC to resolve any questions relating to

the operation and maintenance of the ADEX and to enable

the USC to comply with its mandate in every respect,

this Bureau will, upon request, continue to make the ADEX

list available for review at FBIHO to appropriate HSC

representatives.

Authority for maintaining the ADEX stems from.the

Attorney General and such authority is set forth in a letter

trom the Attorney General to the Director of the FBI dated

October 22, 1971, a copy of which is enclosed with this

memorandum.

Those documents pertaining to the SI to which access

was requested are available for review by appropriately

cleased HSC staff members at FBI Headquarters.

In this

regard, it is to be noted that auchority for maintaining the

SI stemmed from the Attorney General in connection with the

Departmental portfolio entitled "Progran for Apprehension and

Detention of Persons Considered Potentially Dangerous to

the National Defense and Public Safety of the United Staces."

Detailed information and documents concerning what

steps were to be taken in event of a national emsagency are

set forth in the above-mentioned portfolio which, since that

document originated with the Department of Justice, should

be obtained from that source.

As has previously been staced, the ADix is reviewed

continuously and on a monthly basis is brought up to date

with names being added and deleted.

The SI list was prepared

in the same manner and, as with the former sI, when a new

monthly ADEX list is prepared copies of the old list

are destroyed inasmuch as they are outdated and no longer

serve a useful purpose. Also, as you have previously been

advised, names appearing on the former st and the ADEX

nave been printed on 5 x 8 cards with a single name printed

or cach card.

Background information, file numbers, and

type of activity in which the individual is engaged are also

placed on these cards. As was explained to Mr. Vermeire on

October 17, 1975, approximately 15,000 of these cards, all

outdated, have been located at FBI Headquarters. These

Hashington, D. C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chairnan:

I have received your letter of November 5, 1975,

requesting inforuation concerning Soviet-bloc penctrations

of Congressional staffs.

The IDI is aware of only one instance wherein an

indiviaual employed on a Congressional staff furnished to

hostile intelligence agents information obtained through

his Congrescional employment, without the prior knowledge

01 the FBI. After the FBI learned of this action and col

ironted the individual involved, he adnitted that he had

indeed passed intornation which

SECRET

Honorable Otis G. Pike

This Bureau knows of no other "American citizens

and foreign nationals" who may have improperly passed

sensitive information to Soviet bloc intelligence agents

without prior FBI knowledge, Congressional staff members

regularly volunteer to the

FBI facts regarding their contacts

with soviet-bloc officials and other persons who appear

suspicious and who have an undue interest in sensitive material.

Soviet-bloc officials often make efforts to recruit sources

and influential contacts on Capitol Hill through whom they may

obtain sensitive information.

When the FBI learns of such

instances it advises the appropriate Congressman and, if he

has no objection, the FBI may interview the staff member or,

in some instances, consider utilization of him in an operation,

controlled by the

FBl, aimed at determining the reason for the

individual's interest.

These operations are undertaken between

the FBI and the Congressman of staff member with an understanding

of confidentiality and sometimes involve sensitive sources and

methods. To furnish such information to the House Committee, it

15 felt, will not only violate the understanding of contidentiality

the FBI has had with the Congressman and staff members involved,

but may also jeopardize the sensitive sources and methods which

were utilized in some of these cases, and have & detrimental

elfect on our future ability to fulfill our foreign counter-

intelligence responsibilities.

For these reasons i regret that i am unable to

furnish to your Committee information regarding these 11-

dividuals who have confidentially cooperated with the FBI,

Sincerely yours,

Clarence M. Reiley

Houstudy 75 is the code word assigned to the

control file containing communications pertaining to requests

made by the House of Representatives Select Committee on

Intelligence Activities.

By memorandum dated 6/11/75, captioned as above,

which was approved, it was recommended

that, for purposes of

sensitivity and urgency of handling, the Bureau file relating

to captioned matter be maintained in the work area of

personnel assigned to the Houstudy Project, Room 4063 JEH.

It is noted that the above arrangement must be reevaluated

and

recommendations submitted on a semiannual basis.

For reasons cited above, maintenance of the above

file in Room 4063 JEH has proven to be of invaluable assistance

to personnel assigned to that Project. It is recommended,

therefore, that the above arrangement be continued for an

additional six-month period or until such time as the Project

is discontinued, whichever: comes first.

RECOMMENDATION:

That this memorandum be forwarded to the Files andJ

Communications Division for action requested above.

TH

ELECT COMMITTEE

NOVEMBER 18, 1975 INTELL

HENCE

MR, CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE:

I WELCOME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU, AS A

RETIRED FBI SPECIAL AGENT WHO LOYALLY SERVED THE BUREAU. FOR 20.

YEARS AND WHO. WAS ASSIGNED TO THE FBI'S INTERNAL SECURITY INTELLIGENCE

IÓSQUAD IN ATLANTA FOR 10 YEARS, I WOULD HOPE I COULD GIVE THIS

COMMITTEE INSIGHT INTO THE BUREAU'S INTELLIGENCE .PRACTICES. NOT

FROM THE THEORETICAL VIEWPOINT OF A POLICY-MAKER BUT FROM THE

PRACTICAL VIEWPOINT OF A FIELD AGENT;

THE THRUST OF MY COMMENTS WILL BE TO ATTEMPT TO HAVE YOU SEE

THAT IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE STRUCTURE OF AN ORGANIZATION SUCH AS

THE BUREAU TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MUCH WRONGDOING WITHOUT ANY

MEASURABLE. CULPABILITY ON THE PART OF INDIVIDUALS WORKING IN THE

LOWER LEVELS OF THE ORGANIZATION, FOR EXAMPLE, I WAS AT ONE TIME

ASKED TO OBTAIN THROUGH MY INFORMANTS HANDWRITING SAMPLES OF A §E:

GENTLEMAN WHO IS. NOW A MEMBER OF YOUR BODY, THE HONORABLE ANDREW

YOUNG OF ATLANTA, I WAS ALSO ASKED TO OBTAIN HANDWRITING SAMPLES

OF SEVERAL OF HIS ASSOCIATES IN DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING'S SOUTHERN

CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE, I WAS AN AGENT WITH LOTS OF

EXPERIENCE AT THE TIME THIS REQUEST CAME TO ME FROM MY SUPERVISOR

I WAS AWARE THAT THE MANNER: IN WHICH THE REQUEST WAS MADE WAS

THAT THE INFORMATION WAS TO BÉCUSED FOR

REC-41

602-

OF THE ILLEGAL PURPOSES

OF THE BUREAU.

NOT RECORDED

3 DEr. $ 1975

THE REQUEST WAS MADE AFTER REGULAR WORKING HOURS ORALLY TO

ME IN PRIVATE, I TURNED TO MY SUPERVISOR WHO WAS KNOWN AMONG THE

AGENTS AS "COLONEL KLINK" AND TOLD HIM THAT I FLATLY REFUSED TO

COMPLY WITH HIS REQUEST AND THAT HE COULD TELL HIS COUNTERPART AF

THE BUREAU WHO HAD CALLED HIM ON THE WATCHLINE SEEKING THE

INFORMATION THAT I KNEW DAMN WELL IT WAS GOING TO BE USED IN AN-

UNRECORDED COUNTERINTELLIGENCE OPERATION TO DESTROY MR. YOUNG'S

CHANCES OF GETTING ELECTED TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, THE

REQUEST CAME ONLY A FEW DAYS AFTER MR. YOUNG HAD ANNOUNCED THAT.

HE WAS SEEKING A SEAT IN THE HOUSE.

MY SUPERVISOR'S REACTION WAS, "NOW DON'T GET EXCITED ART,

WE WILL MANAGE SOME OTHER WAY," AND I RESPONDED "I SUPPOSE YOU .

WILL." AND I TOLD HIM THAT IF HIS COUNTERPART AT THE BUREAU WANTED

TO FORCE THE ISSUE WE WOULD DO IT IN THE OPEN WITH LOTS OF PUBLICITY, =

THAT WAS THE LAST I HEARD OF THAT REQUEST FROM MY SUPERVISOR AND

I NOTICED LATER THAT MR.. YOUNG MADE IT TO YOUR AUGUST BODY. SO I

MUST ASSUME THAT MY SUPERVISOR HAD NO OTHER SOURCE AT THAT TIME:.

THAT COULD GET THE INFORMATION FOR HIM. YOU, OF COURSE, WILL FIND

NO RECORD OF THE ABOVE INCIDENT IN THE BUREAU FILES:

I AM COGNIZANT OF YOUR MANDATE TO INVESTIGATE. THE INTELLIGENCE

OPERATIONS OF THE BUREAU AND OF THE GREAT MASS OF INFORMATION THAT

HAS ALREADY BEEN UNCOVERED REGARDING THESE OPERATIONS, I BELIEVE,

HOWEVER, THAT A CLEAR AND PRECISE PICTURE OF THE BUREAU'S INTELLI-

GENCE PRACTICES CAN ONLY BE SEEN BY ANALYZING THE ADMINISTRATIVE•

STRUCTURE, THE ENTRENCHED BIASES AND THE PERVASIVE INDOCTRINATED

FBI MENTALITY THAT COMMANDS AND CONTROLS THEIR INTELLIGENCE PRACTICES,

IN THE INCIDENT. INVOLVING REPRESENTATIVE ANDREW YOUNG, IF THE

SAME REQUEST HAD BEEN MADE TO MOST AGENTS WHO HAD REACHED THE LEVEL:

IN THE BUREAU THAT I WAS AT THAT TIME, THEY WOULD HAVE ROUTINELY

NW 55303 DocId: 32989695 Page 237

COMPLIED WITH THEIR SUPERVISOR'S REQUEST SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY

WOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH A PROCESS WHICH WOULD HAVE ELIMINATED

ALL THOSE WHO SAW ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE TYPE. OF ACTIVITY

CONTEMPLATED BY. THEIR SUPERVISOR, THE OFT TIMES EXPRESSED FEELINGS

OF ALL OF THE PERSONNEL WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH ME ON THE

INTELLIGENCE SQUAD IN ATLANTA DURING THE PERIOD THAT THE YOUNG

INCIDENT TOOK PLACE ACCOUNTS FOR THE FACT THAT THE INFORMATION

• REQUESTED WOULD HAVE BEEN ROUTINELY OBTAINED, THE FEELING WAS

• THAT THE RACIAL MOVEMENTS IN WHICH MR. YOUNG WAS ENGAGED, • ALTHOUGH

NOT ILLEGAL PER SE, WAS INIMICABLE TO THE VALUE STANDARDS. THAT THE

SQUAD MEMBERS SUBSCRIBED TO, IF IT TOOK. A LITTLE ILLEGAL ACTIVITY

TO COMPROMISE THE MOVEMENT, THEN SO BE IT. PAST EXPERIENCE HAD.

MADE IT CLEAR TO ALL AGENTS THAT MR. HOOVER HAD NO SYMPATHY WITH.:

ANY RACIAL MOVEMENT.

YOU MAY JUSTLY INQUIRE AT THIS JUNCTURE HOW I HAPPENED TO

SURVIVE IN THE BUREAU IF THESE SELECTION PROCESSES WEEDED THOSE IN

OPPOSITION OUT, THE ANSWER WAS AND IS THAT I WAS BOTH STUBBORN

AND SMART ENOUGH TO KEEP MY RECORD GOOD AND CLEAR AND THOSE AROUND

..ME KNEW IT, AS AN ATTORNEY AND SOMEONE WHO BELIEVED IN THE RULE •

OF LAW, I WOULDN'T CONFORM IF IT REQUIRED ME TO BE DISHONEST OR

TO VIOLATE THE LAW AND I KNEW THE LAW, I CAN SORROWFULLY SAY THAT

MY VIENS WERE NOT SHARED BY MY PEERS IN THE BUREAU.

I JOINED THE FBI AS AN AGENT IN 1951 AND RETIRED IN 19/1:

BY 1957 THE WEAKNESSES IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE BUREAU HAD BECOME.

ALL TOO OBVIOUS TO ME, IN 1950 AS A RESULT OF ADMINISTRATIVE

ACTION TAKEN AGAINST ME BY MR, HOOVER, ON ACCOUNT OF AN ALLEGED

PROBLEM OF OVERWEIGHT, I FOUND MYSELF IN A YMCA ROOM IN MACON;

BUREAU AND ATTEMPT TO EXPOSE THE WEAKNESSES IN STRUCTURE OR STAY

IN THE BUREAU AND WAIT FOR A MORE OPPORTUNE TIME WHEN THE PROBABILITY

OF SUCCESS IN CORRECTING THESE WEAKNESSES WOULD BE GREATER. • I

• DECIDED TO REMAIN AND OBSERVE BUT I RESOLVED THAT I WOULD UNDER

NO CIRCUMSTANCES PARTICIPATE IN ANY OF THE UNETHICAL OR ILLEGAL

ACTIVITIES THAT WERE BY THEN SO PREVALENT IN THE BUREAU,

WAS ABLE TO OBSERVE FROM MY VANTAGE POINT IN THE. FBI THAT

THE BUREAU WAS ON A COLLISION COURSE OF COLLAPSE WHICH WOULD RESULT

IN CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION, AND I. SAID SO OPENLY AMONG. AGENT

ASSOCIATES FROM 1960 ONWARD, I COUNSELLED WITH MANY, YES, PRACTICALLY

ALL, OF THE AGENT PERSONNEL WITH WHOM I CAME IN CONTACT AT THIS

TIME AND FOR THE REMAINING 11 YEARS THAT I SPENT IN THE BUREAU AND

FOUND THAT THEY WERE VAGUELY AWARE IN 1960 OF THE PROCESS OF

WHICH I SPEAK AND THEY WERE ACUTELY AWARE OF IT IN 1971.

THE INHERENT ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES WITHIN THE BUREAU WHICH

I HAVE ALLUDED TO BEFORE, WHICH ADVERSELY AFFECT. THE BUREAU'S

INTELLIGENCE FUNCTIONS CAN BE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS:

1. SECRECY

MR. HOOVER THREW A VEIL OF SECRECY OVER THE BUREAU AT

ITS VERY INCEPTION THOUGH THE GREAT MASS OF INFORMATION

HANDLED BY THE BUREAU COULD BE PLACED ON BILLBOARDS IN THE

MIDDLE OF TIMES SQUARE AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST WOULD NOT

BLOCK. THE

SIDEWALKS, BUT SECRECY SERVED MANY USEFUL PURPOSES

TO THE BUREAU, IT MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE PUBLIC OR

CONGRESS TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON INTERNALLY.

IT GAVE THE BUREAU OPERATION AN AURA OF MYSTERY AND GENERATED

A TYPE OF FEAR AND. RESPECT FOR THE BUREAU WHICH I PERSONALLY

FEEL IS UNHEALTHY IN A SOCIETY THAT STRIVES TO BE BOTH

DEMOCRATIC AND OPEN,

II, . COMPLETE UNFETTERED CONTROL OF THE PROCESS OF SELECTING.

• PERSONNEL.

THIS IS THE AREA TO WHICH YOUR COMMITTEE SHOULD DIRECT

ITS GREATEST EFFORT, FOR IT WAS THROUGH A SELECTION PROCESS.

EXEMPT FROM CIVIL SERVICE UNDER THE SOLE CONTROL OF THE

DIRECTOR THAT MR. HOOVER WAS ABLE OVER A PERIOD OF NEARLY

50 YEARS TO BRING IN THOUSANDS OF CAREFULLY SELECTED AGENT

PERSONNEL WHO WERE POLITICALLY DISPOSED TO THE RIGHT AS HE

WAS

AND THEN THROUGH A PERSONNEL SYSTEM; WHICH OFFERED NO

POSSIBILITY AT ALL FOR AN AGENT TO QUESTION HOOVER'S ETHICS.

AND METHODS, TO FORCE THOUSANDS OF THOSE SELECTED TO. LEAVE

THE BUREAU IN UTTER DISGUST SIMPLY BECAUSE: THEY HAD NO

AVENUE THROUGH WHICH THEY COULD AIR GRIEVANCES INVCLVING

UNETHICAL OR ILLEGAL PRACTICES, FOR EXAMPLE, A YOUNG AGENT

WHOM I KNOW WAS SENT TO ALBANY, GEORGIA FOR HIS FIRST OFFICE;

HIS WIFE WAS A SOCIOLOGIST, SHE WAS OFFERED A POSITION IN

THE HEAD START PROJECT IN ALBANY, GEORGIA THAT WAS UNDER THE

DIRECTION OF A BLACK ATTORNEY NAMED KING, THE AGENT REPORTED

THIS INFORMATION TO HIS SUPERIOR IN ALBANY, HE WAS IMMEDIATELY

SUMMONED TO ATLANTA BY THE AGENT IN CHARGE AND TOLD THAT HIS

WIFE COULD NOT TAKE THE JOB BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WANT FBI..

PERSONNEL OR THEIR WIVES ASSOCIATED WITH BLACKS WHO WERE

ACTIVE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENTS, THIS AGENT SUBSEQUENTLY

RESIGNED IN DISGUST,

111..

MANIPULATION AND CONTROL OF THE PRESS:

THE EXAMPLES OF THIS SUBJECT ARE LEGION,

THE ONE THAT I

AM MOST FAMILIAR WITH WAS THE CONCERTED EFFORT TO GET WHAT. _

WAS ALWAYS REFERRED TO IN THE BUREAU ÀS "OUR FRIENDS IN THE

MEDIA" TO PUBLISH PERSONAL AND VERY PRIVATE INFORMATION TAKEN.

FROM THE WIRETAP WHICH ITSELF WAS OF QUESTIONABLE LEGAL •

VALIDITY ON DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING. OF COURSE, THE DẠY TO

DAY MANIPULATION WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY LEAKING CHOICE ITEMS TO

OUR "FRIENDS", IT WAS NOT AT ALL UNCOMMON TO LEARN OF SOME

POLITICALLY DAMAGING INFORMATION ABOUT SOME LEADING FIGURE

IN POLITICS AS HAVING BEEN DEVELOPED BY THE BUREAU AND THEN

ALWAYS AT A TIME WHEN IT WOULD BE MOST DAMAGING TO THE

INDIVIDUAL, THE INFORMATION WOULD SOME WAY SHOW UP IN THE

CHICAGO TRIBUNE OR SOME OTHER FRIEND OF THE BUREAU. IF THE

INFORMATION WAS MORE VALUABLE FOR PURPOSES OF POLITICAL

BLACKMAIL. BY HOLDING IT, THAN BY GIVING IT TO THE PRESS, IT

WAS WITHHELD, THE LEAKED INFORMATION ALWAYS SEEMED TO INVOLVE

PERSONS OF LIBERAL PERSUASION, (FROM MY YEARS IN THE BUREAU,

I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT THE BUREAU HẠD DEDUCED THAT PERSONS

OF LIBERAL PERSUASION ARE SOMEHOW MORE APT TO SLEEP: WITH.

SOMEBODY ELSE'S WIFE, DRINK TOO MUCH. LIQUOR, OR BE SEXUALLY

PERVERTED THAN ARE SOLID CONSERVATIVES.)

IV. ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY AT THE TOP AND BLIND LOYALTY AT THE

NW 55303* DocId: 32989695 Page 241•

- 7=

BOTTOM AIDED BY THE SELECTION PROCESS,

THIS QUESTION OF LOYALTY IS INTERESTING SINCE, OF COURSE,

WE ALL LIKE OUR FRIENDS TO BE LOYAL TO US AND WE RESPECT

IT AS A QUALITY. IN MAN, THE WATERGATE HEARINGS WERE

PARTICULARLY INFORMATIVE ON THIS POINT AS YOU WILL RECALL.

EACH OF THE WITNESSES WHO WERE IMPLICATED IN WRONGDOING IN

WATERGATE OPENED THEIR STATEMENTS WITH A BIT ON LOYALTY AND

WENT ON TO TELL EVENTUALLY HOW IN THE NAME OF LOYALTY. THEY

HAD VIOLATED THE LAW, THE BUREAU HAS ITS PARALLEL IN THIS

CONCEPT OF BLIND LOYALTY, PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN WILLING TO .

FOREGO THEIR OWN INTEGRITY TO ALLOW IMPROPER, UNETHICAL, OR

ILLEGAL ACTIVITY BY THE BUREAU TO GO ON UNCHALLENGED RATHER

THAN INJURE THE BUREAU BY A PUBLIC ATTACK WHICH MANY REGARD

AS DISLOYAL TO THE BUREAU,

V. HARSH DISCIPLINARY MEASURES,

THE HARSH DISCIPLINARY MEASURES WHICH WERE THE HALLMARK

OF MR. HOOVER'S PERSONNEL POLICY ARE TOO EXTENSIVE TO GO

INTO AT LENGTH HERE, THEY SOMETIMES RESULTED IN HUMOROUS

SITUATIONS BUT VERY OFTEN IN VERY TRAGIC SITUATIONS, BY

THE MID-1960'S THESE HARSH DISCIPLINARY MEASURES HAD SO

ERODED CONFIDENCE IN HOOVER AMONG THE AGENT PEKSONNEL THAT.

THE POLICY OF "TELL THE MAN NOTHING" HAD REACHED A POINT

WHERE INFORMATION COULD ACTUALLY GET. INTO THE HANDS OF BUREAU

SUPERVISORS AND IT STILL WOULD NOT GET TO HOOVER BECAUSE THE .

HARSHNESS OF THE DISCIPLINARY ACTION MADE THE INTEGRITY OF

ALL AGENTS VERY PLIABLE,

IN A DEMOCRACY, DOMINATION OF A POWERFUL ORGANIZATION SUCH

AS THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION BY ANY SEGMENT OF THE

POLITICAL SPECTRUM THREATENS THE VERY EXISTENCE OF DEMOCRACY,

THE PROCESS

RESULTS IN THE ORGANIZATION BEING USED TO AID THE

POLITICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL FRIENDS OR CAUSES. OF. THE LEADER AND TO

NEUTRALIZE ANY OPPOSITION:

MR, HOOVER'S VENDETTA AGAINST DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING ILLUSTRATES

THIS PROCESS IN A GRAPHIC MANNER.

I SUBMIT THAT THE FBI NOW CONSTITUTES A DEGENERATE DICTATOR-

SHIP IN WHICH THE STRUCTURE STILL REMAINS BUT FROM WHICH PUBLIC

SUPPORT IS RAPIDLY BEING WITHDRAWN, I FURTHER SUBMIT THAT SUCH A

• DICTATORSHIP IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONCEPTS UPON

WHICH THIS NATIONAL WAS FOUNDED, I FEEL THAT THIS CAN BE HISTORICALLY

PARALLELED WITH THE ASCENSION OF OTHER DICTATORSHIPS THROUGHOUT THE

WORLD.

I RECOMMEND THAT ANY REFORM WHICH YOU CONSIDER DEAL DIRECTLY

WITH EACH OF THE POINTS I MENTIONED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE

PROCESS BUT 1 URGE YOU TO GIVE PARTICULARLY CAREFUL ATTENTION TO

THE PROCESS OF AGENT SELECTIONS

IN ORDER TO INSURE AGAINST RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF UNCONTROLLABLE

• POWER WITHIN THE BUREAU I WOULD SUGGEST THE FOLLOWING:

1. SEEK THE REMOVAL OF ALL ENTRENCHED PERSONNEL INCLUDING

THE DIRECTOR AS QUICKLY AS IS PRACTICAL, NOT IN. A-

VINDICTIVE MANNER, BUT FOR THE GOOD OF THE SERVICE.)

= 9 -

2. ESTABLISH A. SYSTEM BY WHICH LINE LEVEL PERSONNEL CAN .

REPORT UNETHICAL OR ILLEGAL ACTIVITY WITHIN THE BUREAU

TO AN OUTSIDE CONTROL AGENCY, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME

CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS INVOLVED, I WOULD RECOMMEND

THAT THE CONTROL AGENCY BE UNDER. THE JUDICIARY, THUS

EXTENDING THE CONCEPT OF CHECKS AND BALANCES, AND THAT

THE TIME NECESSARY FOR SETTING UP HEARINGS AND RESOLVING

DIFFICULTIES BE EXTREMELY. SHORT, MAYBE AS LITTLE AS .

SEVEN DAYS SO THAT CORRUPTIVE PROCESSES COULD NOT GET

STARTED..

3, THAT ALL PERSONNEL WORKING WITHIN THE AGENCY AND ALL NEW

PERSONNEL WORKING WITHIN THE AGENCY BE REQUIRED TO ATTEND

INSTRUCTIONAL CLASSES GIVEN BY VARIOUS EDUCATIONAL

INSTITUTIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. IN WHICH THE RIGHTS AND

DUTIES OF BUREAU EMPLOYEES WOULD BE THOROUGHLY TAUGHT SO

THAT WE WOULD NOT HAVE PEOPLE LIKE JIM MCCORD IN THE

WATERGATE SITUATION TELLING THE SENATE IN YEARS TO COME

THAT HE THOUGHT THAT WHAT WAS OBVIOUSLY ILLEGAL COULD BE

MADE LEGAL BY THE FLICK OF A PEN BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

4, LEGISLATE THE PROCESS OF AGENT SELECTION IN SUCH A WAY.

THAT FUTURE PERSONNEL WOULD REPRESENT THE FULL SPECTRUM

OF AMERICAN SOCIETY INSTEAD OF ONLY A NARROW SEGMENT AS

IT NOW DOES. EITHER REDUCE THE PAY OF AGENT PERSONNEL

OR ESTABLISH EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION THAT

WOULD JUSTIFY THE CURRENT HIGH-PAY STANDARDS, I WOULD

PREFER THAT THE STANDARDS BE MADE HIGHER AND LEAVE THE

5, LEGISLATE CONTROLS REGARDING THE RELEASE OF INFORMATION

FROM THE BUREAU WHICH WILL PREVENT THE BUREAU FROM USING

THE WEALTH OF INFORMATION IT COLLECTS AT GOVERNMENT :

EXPENSE AS A MEANS OF PRESS MANIPULATION. (IF QUINN MARTIN

PRODUCTIONS CAN EXAMINE BUREAU. RECORDS AND PRODUCE A .

TELEVISION PLAY AS THEY DID IN THE PHILADELPHIA-MISSISSIPPI

CASE AND, AS I BELIEVE, DISTORT THE TRUE PICTURE IN AN

EFFORT TO PROTECT THE BUREAU IMAGE, THEN I FEEL THESE

RECORDS SHOULD BE THROWN OPEN TO ALL OF THE MEDIA TO DO

WITH AS THEY CHOOSE IN THE INTEREST OF PROTECTING THE

FIRST AMENDMENT. YOU HAVE HERE A CASE OF INVERSE ABRIDGE-

MENT OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS, PROHIBIT THE PRACTICE:

OF ALLOWING THE DIRECTOR TO USE BUREAU FACILITIES TO

• PONTIFICATE THROUGH THE GUISE OF NEWS RELEASES IN WHICH

HE NEVER SUBMITS TO CROSS EXAMINATION BY THE PRESS, IT

SEEMS THAT MR. KELLEY HAS MODERATED THIS EVIL TO SOME

EXTENT. BUT IF YOU DON'T PROHIBIT THE PRACTICE THROUGH

LEGISLATION, HE OR A FUTURE DIRECTOR, ONCE THEY FEEL MORE

SECURE WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY FALL BACK ON THIS ODIOUS PRACTICE,

• THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN.
