Re New York airtel to Bureau, 12/20/60 and

New York letter to Bureau, 1/17/61, resetting out a lead

for the Miami Office to interview DI. LUIS CONTES AGUERO

who had previously offered to provide a "prospectus" of

his organization.

Newspaper articles which appeared in Miami

newspapers in February and March, 1961, reflected that

DI. LUIS CONTE AGUERO was making a tour of various Latin

American countries speaking on behalf of the FAC and of

the Frente Revolucionario Democratico (FRD) against the

On April 17, 1961, MM 724-S advised that CONTE

AGUERO had entered Cuba clandestinely several days previously

in order to participate, as a radio, broadcaster, in anti-

CASTRO invasion plans, which were initiated on the early

morning of April 17, 1961. CONTE AGUERO's last known address

in Miami was 1434 N. W. 29th Street, telephone NE 4-1155.

It appears that the lead to interview CONTE AGUERO

is now obsolete and this case is being placed in a closed

status.
