This matter is being placed in a

This case will be reopened in six months, and the Bureau

BINION was interested in buying him out at the Riviera Hotel.

KORSHAK does not own any interest of record in the

Riviera Hotel or any other gaming casino in the state of

Nevada.

No other definite information has been developed

which indicates that KORSHAK may have a hidden interest.

LV 20-C advised on 1/29/63, that subject BINION

was considering the construction of a $3,000,000 dude ranch

motel and casino in Nye or Mineral County, Nevada, and if

this project is consummated, he will sell

out his interest

in the Horseshoe Club of Las Vegas, Nevada.

LV 16-C advised on 3/12/63, that the subject was

negotiating with Holiday Hotels to build a hotel and lease

a casino to the subject.

The above information concerning the dude ranch

and lease of a casino by the subject has not been confirmed

through any other sources, nor has any recent information

been developed concerning the subject's interest in going

into a motel and casino operation.
