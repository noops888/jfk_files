DETAILS OF PROPOSED INSTALLATION

Pursuant to Bureau authority, dated February 12,

the Ken Iron and Steel Company, 1263 Third Ave., New

The Ken Iron and Steel Company is located in the

twelve hundred block of Third Avenue and fronts on this

avenue, while the rear of the enclosed yard bounds on

Spruce

Alley, running east-west between Second and Third

Avenues and

terminating at the east end of this yard.

Residences on both Second and Third Avenues are

telephonically

serviced through a lead-sheathed aerial cable traversing the

north side of Spruce Alley from west to east, which terminates

on utility pole #19319 immediately behind the yard. From

this utility pole the cable is dropped into the company's

office's cellar where it terminates in a twenty-five

"protector-

paired" box, five pairs of which service the office's various

individual telephone numbers. The location of this office

is approximately 16 wire-miles from the Pittsburgh Office

Consolidated Plant.

CS PC 187-S advised that a cable-record check

disclosed.

severalline pairs which could be made available

for use.

One pair was selected (Pair 847) and on testing it,

measured 2,055 ohms with a db loss of 8.7 over the approximate

16 wire-miles.

northwest

section of the first floor and has approxinately

10' by 11' dimensions.

the 10' ceiling is constructed of acoustical tile.

connects, in addition, with several offices and points in

the junk yard.

wall at a height of 34" and a point 22" from the northwest

corner. Ingress to this area can

be made by removing one

section of plank, two at the nost The preamp leads will be

extended behind the plank, downward and

will emerge on

under surveillance and will be surveilled during

the entire

operation.

the subjects and key associates will be placed in strategic

positions to provide utmost security throughout the entire

operation to insure advance warning of any approach by the afore-

mentioned persons.

It is realized that trespass will occur

but every precaution will be taken to prevent any possibility

of compronise.
