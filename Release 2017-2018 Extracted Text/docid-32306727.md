when the informant went to prison

in 1955, he gave 122 per

cent of it to the LoN boss.

DRAGNA, and to raise money

for attorney fees he sold 122 per cent to roM Jones, one

of the original founders of the company and the only non-

hoodlum who they kept in as a partner.

Eventually,

DRAGNA

gave his 122 per cent to his daughter who is married to SteVe

NIOTTA.

NIOTTA Is now secretary treasurer and is the fleld

man

in the san Diego area.

CALIE

MIRABILE died and his share was obtained by LEO DIA of San

Diego, an IN member who is married to MIRABILEis niece.

The marranGas sold their share to build a bowling alley

and night dub, thus allowing DIA to obtain the controlling

interest.

DIA, as president of the juke box company, in

buy in and become vice president.

GILARDI 1S a CLOSE

personal friend of ICN Capo ANGELO MELI of Detroit.

GITARDE

came to san Diego from Detroit. GIARDI is not an LCN

member

Today, on the record;

the only members are DIA,

the

largest stock holder, GILARDI and NIOTTA.

Informant advised that when he was released from

mrison in 1961, he attempted to buy back in, but DIA tured

him down.

• JOBYDIPPOLITO attemoted to

buy in but was again

turned down.

Apparently, during this time, FRANK DESIMONE,

leader of the family, was

given ownership but kept 1t

to himsell without telling the other members and without

splitting the profits.

The informant feels his share 13

rightfully ICN family property and, in addition, he belleves

CITARDI should be

to sell out as he has no right

in the company.

He has convinced ICN members J0E LIMANDRI and

MARCO LIMANDRI of San Diego that his position 1g rigat.

He does not dare discuss this with his Capo JOEXADAMO of

San Diego who is a close friend of LEO dIA.

on 3/4/68, the informant drove to Ontario,

California, with JOE LIMANDRI,

En route informant learned

that DESIMONE's share was 18 per cent for which he paid

$18, 000.00, but its worth a great deal more.
