In part, from his inherent suspicions that his wife (21 years of age and rel-

atively attractive) was being unfaithful to hin. All Indications are, however,

that A-7 has no real basis for these suspicions; other than those conjured up

in his own mind.

Subsequent discussions with Security

Office revealed that a wire-tap of A-f's house was a major project in itsel

and inpossible to accomplish at this time without tieing up considerable

persounel.) A-T was later told this atter ve assured him that his suspicions

5: Following this initial meeting with A-7,

it was apparent to both

'r. Pekich and the undersigned that time would be needed to restore agent's

confidence in our capability to support his efforts in any future projected

assignment in the field.

Moreover, A-T's emotional state, which appears to

sten from his problems with his in-laws and his concern about leaving his rile

alone, must be fully resolved before attempting to dispatch him egain.

6. In later debriefing session held fron 3 to 15 November with A-7,

considerable more light was thrown on the nature and scope of his operational

activities in Cuba.

As previously indicated in paragraph 1 of this report,

A-7's activities are summarized as follows:

A PANIC-7 Operational Achivities in Cuba:

In line vith bis projected mission to ormenize resistance arouns.

in Revana and Binar del R10 fo= mounting sabotaze operations against

key target installations and assesination of prominent Cuban Cormunist

members in the Castro entourege, A-7 appears to have made some progress

in this direction from the time he amived in cuba in early August 1900

to his subsequent extiltration 5 November.

Upon arrival in Havana,

1-7 began a series of meetings with leaders of the CA, Triple-A and dr

with a view to establishing some degree of rapport in the

furtherance

of his own personal objectives.

It is significant to note that in

a period of approzimately 5 weels, 1-7 made contact with

over 42 indi

viduals, who represented vorious anti-castro groups operating in

the

Havana and Pinar del Rio areas.

1. Internal Assets Developed in Cuba for Future Operational Use:

In attempting to sift out specific assets developed by 4-7 during

his activities in Havana, three of the more prominent individuals with

whom A-7 wes in direct contect should be listed.

in havana, but felt he esuld resolve these differences upon

his om return.

Problens Encountered by 1=7 mile Operating in Cuba:

Some of the more significant problems. encountered by A-7

during the course of his operations in Havena are as follows:

Security:

In this connection, A-7 stated that despite

the disguise given him, he had to be constantly on the alert

from the danger of being picked up by G-2 or Castro police

during the course of his numerous operational contacts. Fe

sited several examples where he believed he vas under sur-

veillance by the opposition and subsequently succeeded in allud-

ing this surveillance.

He complained that his disguise, (hair-

piece and mustache) rapidly deteriorated in the Havana climate

and as a consequence he was forced to abandon this disguise tower

the latter part of his stay in lavena. Similarly; he was forced

to change his quarters continually, by noving fron one safehouse

to another as a security precaution, since he felt that it ras

generally known in Cuban circles that he was operating in the

Hevana area,

and that he was probably already under the sur-

veillance of Castro security forces.

Materiel Support:

In the course of these debriefing

sessions, one of A-7's chief complaints was thet despite sis

urgent nessages sent through his cut-out (ARg-I) to the Station

that arms and other military equipment were sorely needed by!

his groups in Havana and Piner del Rio, no action tras taken to

implement his requests.

As a result, A 7 felt he was losing face

with his followers and

choice in toking over toe operations in this area gainst Castro targets.

In any case, a decision has been reached that A-7 should not be danpatched

without a trained i/I operator who can be relied on to cort closely on

operations with A-? inside the country.

Case Officer Corments:

Despite A-7's tendencies to operate on

a grandiose scale,

his disappointment in the lack of support received on his

initial mission to cuba; and his display of emotional instability at times,

it is believed that his

efforts can be properly channeled to toris effectively

His motivation appears to stem from his personal ambitions

to make his mark on this counter-revolution against Castro, where he can

assure hinself of a priminent position in the future government to be formed

in Cuba after the overthrow of the Castro regime. A-7 has imagination end

the till to succeed. His weakness is his inability to hide his personal

ambitions fron others wao may work with him and who may have altogether dif-

ferent motivations and sense of values.

Hence, it is beliaved that 4-7

vill encounter problems in handling peole recruited or assigned to him in

the course of his activities inside the country.

ANPUG-1 can be sited as

a good example, there a clash of personalities has apparently already taken

place.

In view of this, A-? will have to be dealt with firmly and must ce

convinced that the success or failure of his projected mission will depend

on his ability to develop confidence and loyalty among his followers once hè

is inside the corntry again.

Similarly, A-? must resolve his personal probler

dealing with kis wife and in-laws, which has had an adverse effect on him

personally since his return, and nay affect his operations inside Cuba.

The

next

several weeks will, therefore, need be devoted to re-establish A-7's

confidence in our ability to support his efforts in Cuba,

once he is sent

back, and working out his family problems to obviate any adverse psyccolo-

gical effect which may be detrimental to bis operations im Cuba.
