epileptic

fit while in Santa Cruz County Jail, Nogales,

Arizona, 9/30/67. Santa Cruz County Deputy and County

suffer any injuries or possibly commit suicide while. in

jail.

CURTIS released 9/30/67 to return for preliminary

hearing 10/6/67. He obtained telegraphic money order from

his mother same date and settied lodging bill and bogus check

charges at El Dorado Motel.: {CURTIS has left Nogales,

Arizona;

destination unknown; and it is believed highly un-

likely he will return for preliminary hearing on 10/6/67.

NOTE: Phoenix Office advised that Curtis, former PCI and CI of

New York Officetti

"Is on assignment to bring six million dollars

in "hot" securities and/or jewelry into the United States

through Nogales, Arizona.

Assignment is for Norman Rothman,

owner Albion Hotel, Miami Beach, who is acting on behalf of

Trafficante. Curtis is at El Dorado Hotel, Nogales, awaiting

contact by unknown individuals and advised

he has been paid

$2,000 to date by Rothman.

New York Office has advised that

Curtis has in the past furnished excellent information on LCN

impersonated a police officer to extort money, and is:"money

hungry."
