advised by SA CURTIS that any FBI interest in LANE was unknown

to him.

ALEXANDER then commented that he had known for several

years that a photograph of LANE as the subject of a masochist

rite was in existence and that he (ALEXANDER) has acquired this

photograph recently from an undisclosed source in New York.

ALEXANDER continued that MARK LANE had been critical

of Dallas authorities and the FBI and had caused a lot of

trouble for Dallas authorities. He stated that 1f MARK LANE

should return to Dallas he would be confronted with this

photograph.

SA CURTIS viewed that photograph which depicts a man

nude, with his arms taped behind

him, sexually aroused, and his

sex organs being tortured.

A photograph of MARK LANE contained in Dallas files

was viewed by SA CURTIS who states that if the man in the

paotograph exhibited by Mr. ALEXANDER iS not MARK LANE, such

individual bears definite similarities to him.

Copies of this communication are furnished the New York

Office for information as that office was formerly the office

of origin in the LANE case and may have some knowledge of the

existence of a photograph of LANE as described above.

The foregoing information is furnished for the informa-

tion of the Bureau, did New York and New Orleans and will not be

submitted in LIN for dissemination, UACB, as to disseminate such

information it is felt contact with ALEKANDER would have to be

made as he indicated he was exhibiting the photograph "confidentially".

To indicate to ALEXANDER that this bureau had an interest in MARK

LANE is not considered advisable, inasmuch as ALEXANDER waS a

somewhat controversial figure in

connection with the investigation

concerning the leak of information to the press concerning OSWALD's

diary during the course of the assassination investigation.
