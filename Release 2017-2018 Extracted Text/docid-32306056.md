Regarding the recent killing Of THOMAS ALTAMURA,

Miami (10/31/67) by ANTHONY ESPERTI, informant related that

about a week prior to this shooting, NICK JOSEPH FARINELLA,

brother of Miami hoodlum SAM NICK FARINELLA (associate of

and attempt to intercede with ALTAMURA on behalf of SAM NICK

FARINELLA.

ALTAMURA had instructed ESPERTI to stay away from

the 79th

Street Causeway, Miami Beach, and further, to get

out of Miami or he would kill him (ESPERTI). ALTAMURA

agreed that this did not apply to FARINELLA.

At the same time,

JOSEPH INDELICATO approached ALTAMURA and told hin that

he had no authority to order ESPERTI away from Miami Beach.

After the killing,

INDELICATO and JOE SILESI were ordered to

New York to explain their actions regarding the above, and also

de, and also

to prove that they did not warn ESPERTI that ALTAMURA was

going to kitt him.

MM 676-C advised on 11/13/67 that JINMY PALACINA,

uncle of TOMMY D'ANGELO, is presently in New York,

having

flown there over the past weekend

immediately after the

shooting of D'ANGELO.

Informant advised that several days

after the ALTAMURA killing, D'ANGELO flew to Miami to

attempt to straighten out ALTAMURA's financial status,

and

to attempt to determine what happened to ALTAMURA's money.
