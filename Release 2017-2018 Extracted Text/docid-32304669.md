A fisur was conducted on the morning of 2 6/64 and

noted in attendance at the funeral were DOMINICK "BIG DOM"

MALLAMO, who rode in a Chrysler Imperial sedan, bearing Penn-

sylvania license 167 UA, registered to SAM ADORNATO, 235

East Grant, Indiana, Pennsylvania.

Alsoinoted in attendance

were JOSEPH MALLAMO, brother of DOMINICK, and PAUL and MIKE

ROMEO of Campbell and Poland, Ohio, all alleged members of

the "organization". Due to the steady rainfall at the time

of the funeral, no

doubt the number of persons in attendance

may have been limited, however, there were about 20 cars in

the funeral cortege.

Referenced Pittsburgh letter to Bureau, 1/14/64,

captioned "PG 694-PC; Top Echelon Criminal Informant Program"

and "CAVBOMB"

, set forth a lead at Campbell, Ohio, for the

Cleveland Office to advise whether or not MIKE ROMEO, aka

MIKE ROMANO, was fired upon sometime shortly before CAVALLARO

was dynamited.

It is noted that PAUL ROMEO of Canpbell has been

previously reported as being the retired head of the

"Calabrese Organization" in the Youngstown area, which

organization

is under the jurisdiction of the "Calabrese

Organization" in Cleveland, allegedly headed by TONY MILANO

and FRANK DE AUGUSTINI. MIKE ROMEO Df Campbell, Oh1o, 1s a

son of old PAUL ROMEO and MIKE ROMEO of Poland,

Ohio, is

a brother of old PAUL ROMEO.

The ROMANO who was fired upon,

or an attempt made to murder him by use of a shotgun, was

JOSEPH ROMANO, aka "STONEFACE", a Sicilian, who was

seriously wounded following shotgun blasts about his body

in the yard of his home on 6/4/60 at Youngstown,

which was

about 2= years before the CAVALIARO bombing: Informants have

reported that possibly BILLY NAPLES, bombing - murder victim

at Youngstown on 7/1/62, was responsible for the attempt on

ROMANO.

ROMANO recovered and left Youngstown and moved to

chicago, Illinois, however, informants & Youngstown have

stated they have heard that ROMANO is currently spending his

time in the Sharon - Farrell, Pennsylvania area with members

of the old SAL MARINO organization, it being noted that MARINO

is presently living in California.

It is further to be noted that there are two

distinct groups in the Youngstown area, the "Calabrese

organization" and the "Sicilian organization."

Re lead at Struthers, Ohio, to identify "BILLY SUNDAY"

and evaluate information furnished

by informant concerning

him. It is to be noted that the above no doubt refers to

WILLIAM LANTINI, aka "BILLY SUNDAY", who resides at 2005

Glenwood Avenue,

Youngstown, and is 65 years of age, i's

naturalized, and a Sicilian by birth. LANTINI has FBI #

22716, and when arrested in the past, has used the names

Of VITO DI MANCO, WILLIAM CATALINO,

and WILLIAM LANTINE.

It is also to be

noted that a Youngstown PCI reported that

LANTINI is a close friend of NICK DITTA of the Detroit

"Purple Gang", and that DITTA is a close friend of JIMMY

HOFFA. It is

further to be noted there is no barbut

game in operation h the Yungstown area at the present time,

and the last

that the game operated was on the night of

11/22/62, which was the night preceeding the bombing - murder

Of CAVALIARO. The game at that time was operated in Campbell,

Ohio, having been moved from Struthers, ohio bombing

latter part of June, 1962, just prior to the

murder of BILLY NAPLES on 7/1/62. It is agreed that LANTINI

was connected with the barbut game when it operated, and

it appears that he had a connection with each barbut game

that has operated in the Youngstown area.

PG 694-pc also stated that VINCENT J: DE NIRO,

bombing - murder victim, 7/17/61 bankrolled the Sans Souci

Club in Havana, Cuba for EDDIE TOBIN..

It is to be noted

that DE NIRO was a part owner of the Sans souci Club in

Las Vegas, which closed, and that EDDIE TOBIN, formerly of

Youngstown, was an employee of the Club.

Regarding the shotgun murder of SANDY NAPLES at

Youngstown, Ohio, mentioned by PG 694-PC that DE NIRO arranged

for

this murder which occured on 3/11/60, it is to be noted

that it is the consensus of opinion by Youngstown informants

that NAPLES was murdered because he would not give in to the

"organization" or the "syndicate", and give them a percentage

of his business, and as a result when NAPLES Ignored their

demands,

the "organization" contended there was nothing they

could do to prove their point except to have him murdered.
