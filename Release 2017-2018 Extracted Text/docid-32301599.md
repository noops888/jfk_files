Re: MIRR

determined to be on the night of May 13, 1964, at Lake

Worth, Palm Beach,

Florida, a short distance south of

the Lake Worth Inlet which connects the Inland Waterway

with the Atlantic Ocean.

Mr. Schachter advised that two

men were observed on boardthis speedboat, one of whom had

been Identified as Orlando Ramirez, who, according to

MM T-1, is the MIRR bomb expert.

Fla

on May 12, 1964, Mr. Schachter also advised that

as a result of investigation and surveillance by U. s.

Customs in the neighborhood of a house located near N. W.

29th Avenue and 9th Street, Miami, it was determined that

on the night of May 11, 1964, some unidentified Cubans

left this residence, went to a boat house located near

Miami International

Airport on a lake and returned to the

same residence later' that night with a homemade torpedo

in a car-drawn trailer.

This torpedo was seized by U. S

Customs agents on the morning of May 12, 1964 as Dr.

Orlando Bosch Avila and one Mesa, a Cuban, were transporting

it by car trailer from the house located on N. W. 29th

Avenue to the Coconut Grove area of Miami.

Mr. Schachter

described this torpedo as being about nine feet long, about

two feet in diameter and constructed from a modified airplane

wing tank. This torpedo had an outboard propeller and on

top

an adapter for a radio antenna, which appeared to be

part of the mechanism intended to make it operable by

electronic directional control. It also contained an

electric motor, battery operated.

The nose of the torpedo

contained space

for explosives but it was not loaded.

On May 12, 1964, MM I-l advised that the MIRR

planned to use several walkie-talkie units to maintain

communications between the Bertram speedboat, the attacking

airplane and ground personnel for this operation. He

identified the walkie-talkie as a Cadre Model C-75. It

was determined that these units transmit on 27.085 megacycles

and receive on 27.54 megacycles.

On May 14, 1964, MM T-l reported that the MIRR

now plans to use a floating explosive mine as a substitute

for the torpedo which was seized by U. S. Customs. He said

this mine had been transported to Palm Beach so that the

Bertram speedboat could plant this mine in the direct

path

of the "Las Villas" in connection with the planned attack

on this vessel.

Re: MIRR

Fla

* T- stated that Evelio

Alpizar

Perez had

been making daily flights in a Cessna

airplane from Miami

to the Palm Beach area, surveilling the sea lanes off the

coast of South Florida in order to locate the "Las Villas"

MM T-l anticipated, however, that these flights would be

discontinued temporarily as

the MIRR had received informa-

tion reflecting that the "Las Villas" would not arrive off

the coast of South Florida until later in the week.

on May 15, 1964, Mr. Schachter advised that U. S.

customs had ascertained through appropriate channels that

the "Las Villas" departed Marseilles, France, on May 4,

1964, and passed the Rock of Gibraltar on May 9, 1964,

destined directly to Havana.

On the basis of the reported

speed of the "Las Villas" as being ten miles per hour it

was anticipated that the "Las Villas" would arrive off

the Florida coast about May 22, 1964.

On May 18, 1964, MM T-l advised that Bosch had

instructed that aerial surveillance flights to locate the

"Las Villas" be discontinued temporarily and that Bosch had

altered his plans to include a daily look-out by boat in

the vicinity of Fowey Rock Lighthouse, which is located

at sea about ll miles southeast of Miami.

MM T-1 said that

Captain Francisco Hernandez/Fernandez, who was skipper of

"Ebb Tide" during the unsuccessful December 28, 1963

Fla

MIRR sea - air raid, is in charge of the look-out boat.

Hernandez will conduct this surveillance daily in the

vicinity of Fowey Rock in order to spot the "Las Villas'

as it proceeds south toward Havana.

Upon locating the

"Las Villas", Hernandez is scheduled to notify by radio

the other participants so that the air - sea raid can be

conducted as originally planned.

On May 18, 1964, Mr. Schachter advised that the

Bertram speedboat, mentioned

previously, had been returned

•to Miami on May 16, 1964 and is presently under surveillance

by U. S. Customs in Biscayne Bay. "It was also determined"

by U. S. Customs that rental of this boat had been continued

for an additional week.
