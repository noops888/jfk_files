Apparently as a result of one or more of these contacts

the Mexico City attorney JORGE CASTILLO called source and made

an appointment with him. CASTILLO wanted to know what the

inquiries were about and claimed he desired to be cooperative.

He said he wanted to save source time by telling him that the

subject was definitely not in Mexico and had not been for some

time.

He did not say where subject was located but let

slip

he himself had recently been in the U.S. and made passing

to the fact that the subject was in the U.S. but

only for 7 days.

The petition enclosed a memorandum to the effect

that SAM GIANCANA, an American citizen, wage 59, was desirous

of immigrating to

Mexico and for that purpose would estab-

lish an account with a guaranteed monthly income in Mexico

under Mexican Immigration law.

It cited that on 8/23/66 GIANCANA requested a

change of status from-tourist to immigrant and this peti-

tion was denied on 9/8/66, and he was ordered to leave the

of being one of the heads of the Mafia, an organization

which has been subject to fierce persecution in recent years.

The memorandum continues:

1.

It is true that Mr. GIANCANA was involved

in gambling activities in the United States in the

form of bets on horses (bookies). Nevertheless,

Mr. GIANCANA has not been involved in such activities

since 1950 and has

Because of

such activities in the past, Mr.

GIANCANA has been the object of a publicity

lagainst him largely instigated by the FBI d ampaign;

One of the reasons?

that this persecution

has increased in recent years is because about four

years ago Mr. GIANCANA backed a candidate for Chicago

City Council against a candidate proposed by the mayor,

and the candidate backed by GIANCANA, who was repre-

sentative of the Italian community in Chicago, won.e
