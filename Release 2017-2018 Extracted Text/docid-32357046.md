The point of the

consideration should be given now to "whether or not the

entire matter can be fully disclosed at this time." This

submission is designed to make it possible for you, the

IG and others whom you may desire to consult to make this

decision.

The narrative-interpretive summary has been

put together in such a way that it discloses no cyptonyms.

However. its contents qo

in the Warren Commission documentation.

This point must

Belin's

guestion.

To remove any question in anybody's mind about

our good faith in this matter, the narrative is backed up

by copies of actual documentation from our files.

seems to me necessary,

in reply to Mr. Belin,

that he or

his representative review the documentation that backs up

the narrative.

The documentation has

not been keyed into

the narrative presentation, but it follows the chronologi-

cal order of presentation from 9 October into the latest

developments in the matter,

and there is an overall index

to facilitate reference to individual items.

It seems to me that whoever makes a decision on

whether the entire matter can be fully disclosed at this

time should bear in mind that a subsidiary decision must

also be made,

whether to crop or otherwise fuzz up

the background of the photographs or,

alternatively, to

publish the entire run of the photographs for the first

time without taking out the background.

Obviously, none

of these questions apply to the passage of this material

to Mr.. Belin and the Rockefeller

Commission itself.

think they should see the entire documentation as it

stands.

Perhaps after that, the question of what could

be discussed and the question of "how?" and "how much?"

could be taken up with Mr. Belin himself.

recommendation is that the more we can say about this

matter in a fully open and final manner, the better off

we will be as an Agency.

But it is my understanding

that there are still sensitivé aspects deriving from

fact that the operation which produced the photographs
