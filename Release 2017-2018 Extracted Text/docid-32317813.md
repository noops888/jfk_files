RUSSELE A. BUFALINO, aka

JUNE

ReBuairtel 8/25/64 requesting Phila, to advise

the Bureau by return communication precautions taken to

insure that PH 701-c* is not compromised.

As the Bureau is aware,

FH 701-C* was installed

utiligingan altered

telephone instrument.

Ihis instrument

affords the best security available in this type of 1n-

stallation:

BUFALINO as is known fron previous information

furnished by PH 623-0* 1s suspicious of any telephone

instrument.

For example, he has advised PH 665-0-TE to

be extremely cautioue in using the telephone and not

necessarily the telephone involved with PH 701-C*.

does, however,

even after cautioning PH 665-0-TE, talk

freely with this informant.

BUFALINO made the comment that he thought his

telephone was tapped during a telephone conversation.

It

appears, therefore, that BUFALINO 1s not suspicious of

coverage being afforded by PH 701-C* but is suspicious

of telephones being

"tapped."

Resident Agents in Wilkes-Barre have previously

been advised and were again reminded on 8/26/64 to be

alert for any information that might develop which would

indicate that this source had been compromised

Enployees

handling the

Central Plant in regard to PH 701-g* were

again on 8/26/64 reminded to be alert for this type of

information.

This is standard procedure but has been re-
