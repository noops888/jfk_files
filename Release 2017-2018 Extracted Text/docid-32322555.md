The originals removed from these files and replaced with

duplicate copies of the original were accessioned to the National

Archives and Records Administration (NARA) pursuant to the JEK

Records Collection Act of 1992.

Provision of the JFK Act allowed

for certain information to be postponed from public release until

the year 2017; therefore, the pages have NOT necessarily been

released for public review in their entirety.

Inder the JEK Act, originals to all material deemec

assassination records must be accessioned to NARA regardless of

whether the material is open in full

or released with information

postponed. Therefore, any documents or pages from FBI files

accessioned to NARA pursuant to the JFK Act are no longer

considered the possession of the FBI. The duplicate pages have

been inserted strictly for research purposes.

The copies contained within the previously mentioned

file(s) do not necessarily show the most up-to-date

classification.
