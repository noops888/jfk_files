an insurance agency in Kansas City to be backed by ALLAN DOREMAN

Union members in Kansas City.

This company was to handle general

insurance, automobile insurance, fire and liability insurance and

was to furnish supplemental health medical care policy for union

members in addition to that which they already have with the union.

This company, according to CI, already operates through most of

the southern part of the United States, being operated by DUSTY

MILLER, an international organizer for the Teamsters Union, whose

headquarters are in Dallas, Texas. According to the plan, 10% of

the premiums on policies written by this company were to

go to the

individuals in Kansas City responsible for the operation.

These

individuals identified by CI as ROY LEE WILLIAMS, President, Joint mo

District Council 56 and Local 41, CECIL BENNETT, Secretary and

Treasurer of Local 41, and others whose identities he did not know.

In connection with this matter,

JABEN inasmuch as SCHWARTZ is also the agent who has

the insurance policy for the Gordon Building in Sedalia, Missouri,

which property is owned by AUGUST GORDON The purpose of this

contact with JABEN, according to CI, was to straighten out GORDON's

insurance with JABEN, it being noted that JABEN is alleged to be

the individual contacted by GORDON to destroy this building for

him.
