MISCELLANEOUS - INFORMATION CONCERNING

00:. Los Angeles

Re Los Angeles airtel 1/30/62.

IA 4350-C was interviewed on 3/28/62. He stated

he obtained his information through his various contacts

over the years, and that he is unable to furnish evidentiary

data or leads which could develop proof of the type desired.

Informant said he has heard that CHAVEZ has been

Indicted In Puerto Rico on some felony charges, details of

which he does not know, and that as a result CHAVEZ may be

losing his importance in union matters in that area.

Because the informant is not in a position to

furnish additional data even though he is convinced his

original data is an accurate analysis of the situation

which has existed, this matter is being closed.. If the

P'informant at a later date does obtain data which can : be

used, it will be forwarded to the Bureau.
