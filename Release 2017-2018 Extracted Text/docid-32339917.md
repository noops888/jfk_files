tions on to his deputies.

CHUCHUKIN concerning the above mentioned security precau

tions which are now in effect in the KGB NY Residency.

CHUCHUKIN told the informant it seems to him that all

the employees of the KGB NY Residency are somewhat

surprised at these new regulations.

CHUCHUKIN said he

can well understand why these regulations are put into .

effect, namely, to maintain the best security possible

in the

KGB NY Residency.

He sail, however, that he

considers the new method of handling correspondence from

Moscow to be most unwieldy

and he predicted that as

soon as tensions relax somewhat, the residency will be

back to its former methods of operation. CHUCHUKIN

said that if GABELKO and the heads of the other branches

In the NY Residency vigorously pursue the policy oi

"snipping up" the film containing correspondence from

Moscow,

and handing It out to the individual KGB employees,

they will soon lose track of the correspondence and will

be in a worse administrative predicament than before they

started this new arrangement.
