WATSON I. ROPER

REGISTRATION ACT - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

INTERNAL SECURITY - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

Reference my memorandum 8/21/59 pointing out that

Lieutenant Rene Raiole, NA, Monroe County Sheriff's office, Miami,

Florido, was approached by Frank and Roper to undertake trip to cuba to

obtain certain information desired by Dominicans. Raiole initially

expressed willingness to accept assignment in order to assist U.S.

Government. '

By teletype 8/25/59 Miami advised that Ratole had discussed

matter on strictly confidential basis with his superior, Sheriff John

Spottswood.

Spottswood called attention to possible serious personal

risks involved to Raiole as well as potential embarrassment to sheriff's

office if Raiole became involved in difficulties in Cuba.

Spottswood

encouraged Raiole to cooperate and report subject's activities in U.S.

but could not approve his proposed trip to Cuba.

By teletype 8/26/59 Miami advised that Raiole had talked via

long-distance phone with subjects, who are in Miami, on morring of that

date.

They were disappointed that he was unable to handle assignment

but appréciated his position. Raiole declined to furnish subjects"

names of his contacts in Havana whom Roper might get in touch with.

However, he offered to try and secure information desired (regarding

whereabouts and status of William Alexander Morgan) from his acquaintances

who travel on Key West-Havana Jerry. Fatole plans to make discreet

inquiries among his contacts on this ferry on evening of 8/27/59 and to

thereafter recontact subjects.

OBSERVATIONS:

tially with sheriff Spottswood was entirely properir and that,

he had obligation to do so in view of possible adverse reflection

on sheriff's office if difficulties did arise

in connection with Raione

dealings with subjects.

Sheriff Spottswood's action in discouraging

Tolson proposed Cuban trip by Raiole was

reasonable in view of the circimstances.,

Memorandun Donahoe to Belmont

Re:

JOHN JOSEPH FRANK

WATSON L. ROPER

97-3293

As noted above,

Spottswood has encouraged halole to cooperate. as

fully as possible so long as foreign travel is not involved.

In view of these developments, it is likely that subjects

will adopt one of following courses: (1)

Frank or Roper may undertake

trip to cuba personally, more Itkely Roper, since Frank may be

unwilling to make trip

in view of his notoriety resulting from

valinder case las noted previouslys there is arreday some inalcduor

Roper is considering making the trip/s : (2)

subjects may seek to

recruit another individual, possibly another law enforcement officer

in Floride, with whom they are acquainted, to perform this mission.

It is hoped that additional information concerning the subjecte!

plans

can be secured through Ratole; however, this is not likely and it is,

therefore, essential we affora closest coverage possible to Frank and

Roper to keep abreest of their plans.

ACTION:

Attached is airtel to Miami, with copies to Wro and Legats

Havana.

Miami is being instructed to

maintain close contact with

Raiole as to outcome with future meetings he may have with subjeots.

Miami is also being instructed to offord closest coverage possible

con' both subjects in effort to determine their future contacts and i

activities, particularly with respect to proposed intelligence

assignment

in Cuba.

Miami being requested to utilize spot check

physical surveillances on subjects, where varranted, and to place stops

so that we will be apprised of any

travel Frank of Roper may make

to Cuba.
