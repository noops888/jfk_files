This list omits persons not directly involved other than in the

line of command, from the level of Deputy Director up. Two division

chiefs are listed--J.C. King and Bronson Tweedy--and might, by reason

of their seniority, be omitted from the list of those whose names

should be deleted. The list, otherwise, is a mix of Agency employees,

cooperating individuals, and agents.

The comments below first treat

the question of Agency employees.

Agency Employees

The day-to-day record of events is subject to relatively

direct icconstruction, and the drait opts for detailed rocitation.

In some instances, the format calls for treatment of the same

subjeci matter trom more than one point of view. Relying on

this approach, there has bech extensive recording of the true

names of individuals. This is so extensive in some sections

of the report that major editorial revision will be required to

protect those entitled to it.

Those employees still living--cither still active or retired--

require protection from whatever repercussions that might

Now from official connection with the reported events.

They

are entitled to this both in traditional terms of protection of

employees and agents in their work, and in terms of separating

them from such unpredictable incidents as may llow from

publication.

Other U. S. Employees

Publication of the names of Henry Dearborn, John

Barfield (Department of State) in connection with the

Trujillo affair should be omitted (Section E). Mention

•' Colonel wimery" Séction E) in connection with the

Schneider affair also should be accorded the same treatment.

Cooperating Individuals

Robert Maheu, whatever publicity he has been given, is

entitled to protcction from official .confirmation of the press

stories. Not only is he entitled to protection from direct

association in the Castro operation, he is entitled to protection

from incidental revelation of his involvement in other unrelated

activities (The report cites his involvement in an Onassis-

Niarchos contest, on which he reported to the government, and

in making a motion picture te discuss oreign leader).

The Syndicate members through whom Maheu worked

pose a somewhat different problem, but the same central

issue remains. We cannot divine how publicity would impact

on their future. Giancana is dead, presumably as a result

of unrelated events, but how publicity would affect Trafficante

and Maceo is debatable.. Both are entitled to this protection.

Roselli, now engaged in deportation proceedings, may wish

the publicity to strengthen a claim to special consideration,

but he nevertheless is entitled to the same protection that

the others are.

Grcal care is taken to conceal the identity of an aclion

asset inside Cuba (Section D.I., pp 18-19), but his true

name appears at page 21. He is believed to still be alive,

and is entitled to protection.

The full name of Tony Varona appears often. (Section

D.I. p 19, ff). He is entitled to protection.

One man named in the draft, but unknown to this reviewer,

(FNU) Gomez (Section E, p 5), should be checked for identi-

fication.

He would seem entitled to protection, in the context

that he is mentioned.

The name offAlonzo Berksis included (Section E, pp 16-22,

p. 31). Although he has received publicity in the past, he is

entitled lo prolection from official confirmation of his role

in the Trujillo affair.

Section F. pp 30-42. The listing by rame of a number of

Chilean officers, some of whom have been tried in Chile lor

their role in plotting, would reveal additionally contacts with

a foreign power. This might open them to new charges at some

time in the future.

Reference Inaccuralely Convering

Impression of Operational Involve-

ment of American Citizen

D.I. pp 28-29. In reporting the various schemes conceived

at working levels in CIA lo infect a diving suit, the impression

is conveyed that Attorney James Donovan might be aware of

what was being discussed, while there is no cvidence that he

was. His being mentioned in true name, in this context, is

subject to correction.

Uninvolved Bystanders

Recitation of the Las Vegas bugging incident is such

as

to expose both Dan Rowan and the person associated with him

in the incident. Official publication would give the press a free

run at this unnecessary detail in a private life. (Section D. J.

pp 13-17).

Identification by Description

In some instances, where the actual name is not recorded,

the description is such that the identification can be made

readily by knowledgeable persons.

Section D.I. P. 4. The summary of an offer by a Cuban

pilot in July 1960, to cause an accident that would kill senior

Cuban officials, makes his identification a

relatively simple

thing for the Cuban DGI.

Section D.I. PD 29-34. The description of AMLASH/1 is

such that his identity is fairly simple. Were there any doubt,

the citing of specific dates on which he was met outside Cuba

(pp 31, 33, 31 and 35) would make it very clear who he is.

He is

now in prison in Cuba and is entitled to this protection.

Section E. Even if the name of COS Ciudad Trujillo is

omitted, the title is still revealing to knowledgeable persons.

More general reference to cables to and from the "Station"

would generalize the identity, assuming that any reterence

is necessary.

Section F. p 27. The COS is cited but not named. It is

preferable that reference be to the "Station" and not to him

as an individual.

Section F. pp 30-42.. In conjunction with a listing of

Chilean officers by name (supra),

the additional identi-

fication of a "Lieutenant Colonel,

" a "Navy Captain, " and

an "Air Force General," presumably not previously identified,

could lead to further inquiry in Chile. General reference to

"Chilean military ligures" should suffice, if any treatment is

necessary.

•Section G. The use of the pseudonym "Fledgman" for the ,

Chief of Station in Leopoldville/Kinshasa would be illusory

if it is intended lo conceal his identity, Those knowledgeable

would soon penctrate the device. Some more general reference

to the CIA Station is

a minimum requirement.

24 Section G. p 13. The direct citation of Station use of

Conglese security manho was in liaison with the CIA Station

would permit his ready identification.

Cryptonyms

The draft report

employs cryptronyms of agents and

operations that probably should not be contested. New digraphs

may be necessary in the Latin American Division (e. g., AMLASH,

JMWAVE), bui these probably cannot be avoided. Preferably

they should not be used, but the Rockefeller Report set a precedent

that might as well be followed.

Section F. p 21. Reference to the initials "CAS" is no

more than a designation employed by other governinent agencies

in referring to CIA in certain communications. It should be

replaced by the "CIA" initials, if used at all.

Sources and Methods

It is impossible to treat the entire subject of these various

operations, recording day-to-day activities in such detail,

without revealing a great deal about patterns of thought and

activily that will reveal a great deal to foreign intelligence

analysts about CIA techniques, attitudes and modus operandi.

The draft report is highly revealing, in its extensive detail.

While it would be misleading in some respects, it nevertheless

reveals a great deal about staff planning at lower levels (prior

to elevating the results, if ever, for senior review), methods

for approaching potential agents (and considerations in how to

try lo bring them under control and direct them), use of cut-

outs, etc. Some specific revelations are rioted below:

Section D.I. Pp 22-28. In describing Harvey's past and

other roles, interesting bits of information are revealed to the

knowledgeable analyst.

Harvey's role with the Berlin tunnel

is cited.

Description of his later division--surreptitious

acquisition of codes--could present an interesting orgarizational

concept for the analyst. The recruitment of a forcign agent for

his criminal talents, by a named Agency employce working lor

Harvey (according to the draft report), would be read by foreign

analysts for what it was, a man lo stcal codes. The speculation

in the draft report doesn't seem to support a rationale for including

these bits of information.

Section D. I. pp 29-34. It is noted above that AMLASH could

be identified by the pattern of his foreign meetings. It also

highlights the ability of the Agency to follow the coming-and-

going of foreign intelligence targets, an item that would attract

the attention of foreign CI analysts.

Section D. I. p 38. Reference to a meeting in Madrid

between AMLASH and another\gency operational contact,

arranged by the Agency withont the knowledge of either participant,

is a technique that should not be publicized.
