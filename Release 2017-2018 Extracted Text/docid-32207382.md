THAT. IT MARKED THE POINT WHERE THE WESTERN WORLD. NO LONGER

TRUSTED ITS GOVERNMENTS TO TELL THE TRUTH. ALREADY THE NUREMBERG

TRIALS OF WORLD WAR II HAD PROCLAIMED THAT OFFICIAL ORDERS

COULD NO LONGER BE AN EXCUSE FOR GRAVE MORAL CONDUCT. AND

INDIVIDUALS FOUND THEY NEEDED A CODE OF BEHAVIOR. THE

WARREN REPORT SEEMED TO SHOW THAT NO GOVERNMENT COULD BE RELIED
