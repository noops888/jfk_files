An additional copy of this letter is being submitted

For information of the Bureau and other offices,

at approximately 9:00 P.M., 10-16-67, an individual, who did

not wish to furnish his identity, telephoned the San Antonio

FBI office.

He advised that he wanted to furnish that office

some information about a Mexican citizen named ROBERTO NIETO.

The caller said that NIETO is a personal friend of FIDEL CASTRO

and

that he has traveled to Cuba at least three times in the

last 18 months to see CASTRO.

NIETO, according to the caller,

is presently living in, or has been living in, Miami. His

purpose there is to keep track of the Cuban refugees in

Miami.

He was supposedly enrolled in one of the local

universities as a cover.

The caller advised that NIETO is a very wealthy

ORICITAL FILED L

man, that he had a concession from the Mexican Government

to

transport oil and butane from Mexico into the interior,

but he has fallen out of favor with the Mexican Government

and lost his concession.

The caller further stated

that

NIETO is an extreme liberal.

He did not know NIETO's address

ish a description of nim.
