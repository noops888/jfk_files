Title: . John F. Kennedy Records Collection

Action of 1992 (the Act)

Synopsis: No records available at Legat, Mexico City.

Administrative:

Re OPCA EC to Mexico City, dated 4/20/98.

Details: Referenced EC requested that Mexico City search all

their indices for all files and references to liaison with the

CIA in Mexico City for the years 1960-1965. Legat, Mexico City

does not maintain any manual indices records, which were utilized

prior to November 9, 1988, when Legat, Mexico City was automated,

nor do we have any files

for the period 1960-1965 regarding the

CIA.

Mexico City's manual index records and all files were

sent back to FBI Headquarters where they are maintained in the

National Archives for historical value.

For a search of these

records you will need to initiate the search through FBI

Headquarters, Field Information Support Section, File Services

Unit and/or the Micrographics Unit.
