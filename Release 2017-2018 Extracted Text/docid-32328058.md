CONFIDUNTIALI

We are attaching herewith a release published

in the press today, as well as a photograph of JOSEPH

Go LEASE, captioned aboue,

who claims to be a big business

magnate in the united states, a breeder of purebreds,

promoter of track enterprises, eto, possessing large

capital:

This indiviqual has come

to promote the racing

season at our hippodrome, but there, is a series of details

which causes us to be suspicious of his activities. (4

4)

our hippodrome in the last twenty years has

maintained an average of plays which does not go abou

45 thousand pesos per race day (races are held three days

a week), which amounts to a weekly total of 135 thousand.

This individual has presented a program of prizes and

salaries which

would require the raising of 300 thousand

pesos in plays per week in order to just barely cover the

expenses. of the business. Only by means of clandestine

gambling, pLus a sweepstake in April, couldt couer the costs

of this business and for this it would be necessary to

have placed a large number of such tickets.

since nobody

is

"fighting against his money," it would seem strange to

us that this business would not represent a great daily

loss, for which reason we request from you, or from whomever

it is pertinent,

the exact information regarding this

individual, that

is, whether he actually is a promoter,

breeder, capitalist, etc. (EDU)

There is one more. detail. Last night, as you

will see in a note, he was mysteriously assaulted,

"allegedly

As you well know a

Iuxurious hotel, such as the "Hotel Nacional" of Cuba, does

not permit anyone to go upstairs to private rooms without

authorization from the guests for which reason we believe

that this may involve problems of a "gang" in operation and

that this individual forms part thereof.

The reason for

this

request

the season begins

the coming loth of

this
