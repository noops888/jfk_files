MEMORANDUM FOR: General Counsel

ATTENTION

VIA

SUBJECT

: Mr. Gary Breneman

: SA/ADDO

: William J. Johnson, jr.

A thorough search of WHD, ISG and Station WH/Miami

indices has failed to turn up information on any connection

of Mr. Johnson with any Agency sponsored activity now and in

the past.

The office of security advises

that they have no

record of Subject.

The indices checks

did reveal that subject

has been involved in anti-Castro activities since the

early

1960's with Frank Anthony STURGIS aka Frank FIORINI.

2. In short, there is no record that william J. Johnson, ur.

nas ever been emploved by or officially connected with the central

Intelligence Agency in any capacity whatsoever.
