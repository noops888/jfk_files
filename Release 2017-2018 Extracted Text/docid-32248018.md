The group

elfective infiltration by the Government.

Dallas T-l advised

that the group has to immediate plars for action, but that

several tines locally inis group has determined to act on their

Texas, appears

Individual in northeast Texas who goes by the name of "South"

and that this contact may be utilized in the raiding of a

northeast Texas arnory during the winter months.

The primary

interest is obtaining mortars and mortar anmunition and autonatic

weapons; therefore, Dallas I-l believes that the armory would

probably be of a taus or infantty group.

to galn control of the Pantber City Motorcycle Club for the purpose

of gaining land apparently owned by this club, in the area of

Lake hrlington, Texas and thereafter selling this laud and using

are personally acquainted with General Edwin! Walker and he

apparently bas a capacity of being as

advisor.

The group does

not apparently have any cossection with the American Nazi party

or with the Eu Klux Klan.

The group is organized into small cell-

l1ke bodies and the meetings of these are never held on a

regular basis and are generally held in public places at night
