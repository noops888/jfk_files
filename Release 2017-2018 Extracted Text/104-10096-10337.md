MEMORANDUM FOR:

JHW

Shep phoned to say that James Wilcott, Jie, a finance

clerk with the Agency from 1957 (50D as GS 4), who served

in lokyo 1960 to October 1964, has told HSCA people that

CIA hired Lee Harvey Oswald

When Oswald served in Atsugi.

Wilcott, after returning from Tokyo was assigned to JMWAVE

In 1965, and resigne/retired in 1966.

I noted that Oswald retired from the Marine Corps in

September 1959. and went to the UsSR in Octobet that year.

returning totthe US in June 1962. He was gone from Japan

Anything that

Wilcott thinks he knew had to be second hand√≤. I said that

Russ Holmes inherited the so-called Oswald files, but that

he has assured me the Agency had no contact with Oswald. If

there are contrary records they would have to be in EA files

at WIC, and FA should be on it right away to identify what

is involved. When anything turns up to be checked, O/Fin

should then get at it right alay. He is after it.
