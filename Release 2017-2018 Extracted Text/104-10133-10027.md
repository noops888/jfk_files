presuming that the heretofore missing "Project Johnny" file

Office of Security files relating to the MAHEU/ROSELLI matter

have been reviewed, and that the pertinent information contained

"therein has been forwarded to the Inspector General for review.

It should be noted that in 1967 the Inspector General

conducted an investigation into the MAHEU/ROSELLI matter, and

in so doing collected numerous memoranda from the various

Agency components directly involved.

As a result, additional

memoranda which may have previously been held separately by

the Director of Security, may be in the possession of the

Inspector General.
