COSA NOSTRA

AR - CONSPIRACY

Re Bureau airtel 8/1/63, and my airtel 8/8/63.

On August 9, 1963, Assistant Commissioner Parsons

again contacted the writer to advise that the Commissioner,

RCMP, had received a number of calls from the representatives

of the Canadian press on August 8, 1963, in which they

endeavored to obtain a statement from him on a story to the

effect that JOSEPH VALACHI had been spirited to Canada by the

FBI with the cooperation of the RCMP and was presently under

close guard in an isolated area in either the Province of

Alberta, Saskatchewan or Manitoba.

Assistant Commissioner Parson said he merely wanted

to bring this matter to the attention of the writer and that

the Commissioner had responded to the inquiries to the effect

that they were "silly questions" and otherwise maintained a

"no comment" attitude.
