SAN JUAN

AT SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO

Since it appears that MANUEL RAY of San Juan,

Puerto Rico is the present leader of the PRP, it is:

recommended that San Juan conduct appropriate investigation

to determine whether this organization has become inactive

or dormant and whether further investigation is justified.

MIAMI

AT MIAMI, FLORIDA

Will maintain close contact with logical sources

- for future developments.
