Mr. Piccolo, as an-Intelligence assistant, has performed exceptlonally

well in an operational assignment that would normally be carried out by an

operations officer of higher grade and greater espertence. He is calm,

agrecable, cooperative and Imaginative, and has displayed maturity and good

judgment in handling his assigned dutles.

He also has the ability to think

logically and fast in difficult and embarrassing situations, and his fluency

in Spanish has been of considerable help in enabling him to handle agents

and prospective agents whose English is either limited or negligible. He

Is leaving the Branch because of his acceptance as a candidate in the

unlog olier Training Program.
