if a photograph of captioned subject can be obtained,

RODRIGUEZ can readily determine whether captioned sub-

ject is identical with JOSE SOLER MOJARRIETA.

MOJARRIETA.

MM 492-S was contacted by SA JAMES D. HAYES

on January 24, 1964 but could furnish no pertinent

information concerning JOSE SOLER MOJARRIETA Or JOSE

MOJARRIETA::

No further investigation is being conducted

by the Miami Office unless requested by office of

origin, as it appears that office can determine from

INS records on captioned individual whether he is iden-

tical with JOSE SOLER MOJARRIETA. If there is a doubt,

the New York Office should obtain a photograph of

captioned subject and furnish Miami for exhibiting to

PRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ TAMAYO, to determine if identical

with JOSE SOLER MOJARRIETA.
