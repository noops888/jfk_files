Johanna Ross. Johanna Ross is an American citizen

who went to Russia as a governess for the children of the American

Ambassador. Nosenko stated that she is promiscuous and was seduced

by two African students and was then compromised by the KGB. Our

files show that Ross is the holder of a current United States passport

and investigation of her background has been instituted.(F) (#Yu)

4. Information concerning various American citizens who

have been compromised in the USSR and recruitment attempts made against

them has been given by Nosenko. He referred to the attempt to recruit

Robert James Barrett, American medical student who was an interpreter

at the United States Plastics Exhibition in Russia in 1959.

No

recruitment attempt was made in 1959; however, when he returned to

Russia in 1961, he was recruited on the basis

of the compromise effected

during his 1959 trip.

Barrett is now an informant of the Bureau.

the American Embassy, such as James E. Keyzers, Joseph Marone, Matthew

Information about attempts

to recruit newspapermen

stationed in Moscow has ben given by Nosenko. He said an Associated [UJ

Press representative in Moscow had been recruited. At this time there

are three representatives and we have opened cases to attempt to

identify the one who has been recruited. Nosenko told of the recruitment

of Sam Jaffe,: American Broadcasting Company correspondent in Moscow.

We have interviewed Jaffe and he gave us this information prior to his

recent return to Moscow. Nosenko

also claims that Thomas Whitney had

furnished nonessential information to the KGB in Moscow but refused to

do so on his return to the United States. He also said that Eddy Gilmore

of the Associated Press was a recruitment target and that Francis Stevens

of United States News and World Report was compromised. We knew of the

compromise action against Stevens since he had told us about it and we
