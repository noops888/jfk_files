November 25, 1965, OTTO "DUKE" KOLING, an individual, who

had in the past been associated with captioned organization,

had been killed in a motorcycle accident at ft. Worth, lexas.

Dallas T-I advised that he had not heard of any

meetings held by the American Underground, and in his opinion

the organization seemed to be dying out.

He advised that as

OTTO "DUKE" KOLING had been one of the main contacts in the

organization, his recent death would be an additional reason

for lack of activity by anyone who had in the past been

associated with the group.
