The following information was furnished on February

28, 1964 by MM I-1, who is well acquainted with some officials

of the CASTRO Government and certain leaders of the SNFE, an

anti-Castro organization with headquarters located at 109-111

Southwest 12th Avenue, Miami, Florida. GU)

On February 28, 1964 seven Cubans representing the

SNFE, and two Americans who were described as lawyers from

Orlando, Florida, met in the office of ELLIOT ROOSEVELI, Miami. C

Five of the Cubans known to the source were ANTONIO:

VECIANA, RICHARD VERANES, one GARCIA (first name unknown), one

MEDINA, possibly CARLOS MEDINA, and ARMANDO FLEITES. @CA

The two Americans were a Mc. BISHOP and BOB

PETRIE,

both lawyers, allegedly from orlando CATW

FLEITES was spokesmanofor the group, of at least, the

one who did most of the talking for the group.B) U)

In about an hour and

a half, which involved much repe-

tition, the group told Mr. ROOSEVELT that he had been selected

as the best possible man to contact President LYNDON B. JOHNSON

and completely inform him of the group's plans, and endeavor

to secure his moral support. The SNFE would like for the Pres-

ident, at every public opportunity, to express his understand-

ing of the democratic ideals of, and sympathy fox

those fighting

CASTRO and his communist dictatorship in Cuba. (U

BAL

RE: SECOND NATIONAL FRONT OF ESCAMBRAY

FLEITES emphasized that the group Is not asking for

arms, money or transportation.

He claimed they have the men,

arms and the means to attack and overthrow CASTRO. He stated

the SNFE would not use any part of the United States from

which to launch its attack but as soon as they occupy a ter-

ritory large enough to be recognized as a de facto Government

or as a Government in arms the SNFE would like to be assured

that the United States would recognize its members as such

a governing body and give them support of a moral and economic

nature.

FLEITES claimed it would be relatively easy

to tumble FIDEL CASTRO from power as the Cuban people

are now fully fed up with him. He said the big problem would

be controlling radical elements and re-establishing law and

order after CASTRO is overthrown. He assured that his group

would not be fighting in a spirit of vengeance but from a

desire

to liberate Cuba from its oppressive Communist dictator

ship.

и)

Asked regarding the nature of the Government

he proposed to set up in Cuba, FLEITES stated it would

certainly be Democratic, and that free enterprise would

be recognized and encouraged. MM T-l stated as an indica

tion of the talkative nature of FLEITES or possibly as an

indication of the kind of Government he has in mind,

FLEITES stated:

"For the moment, we are not considering

nationalizing any of the firms, industries,

or privately owned property in

• Cuba"

FLEITES concluded that an exact date for starting

the action against CASTRO has not been set. He said his

group would llke to submit progress reports through Mr.

ROOSEVELT in order to keep the President of the United States

fully informed of the progress being made by his group

toward acquiring ability to launch an attack and sustain it

long enough to accomplish the above-stated purposes. He

stated the group can be contacted through RICHARD VERANES,
