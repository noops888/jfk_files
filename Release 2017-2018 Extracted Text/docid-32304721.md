ReLative to the murder of Dominio Molo, or

September 2, 1903, prime suspect In the death of CHARLES

CAVALIARO, MEZZATESTA advised CV-344-C the following:

He stated from his own investigation of the

movements of MOIO prior to his death,

he believed that

MOTO had been killed in Youngstown and his body was then

taken to Canton,

Ohio, where it was recovered. He gave

no indication of those responsible, and CV-344-c did not

pursue this.

He stated that DOMINIC MOIO definitely was

responsible for the death of BILLY NAPLES who was blown

up in his car, July 1, 1962.

He stated that MOIO had been

ordered to set

Up NAPLES and took an active part In the

He did not elaborate on the details

or the others

Involved. He did,

however, state that MOIO "led BILLY NAPLES

around by his nose" and was on his payroll.

• He said MOLO

and BILLY NAPLES had many times visited together in his home,

and MEZZATESTA personally was very fond of BILLY. He stated

regardless of his feelings for BILLY when "they"

stated he

had to be eliminated, he was powerless to do anything to stop

his murder, regardless of his personal feelings.

According to CV-344-C, MEZZATESTA stated that

MOIO had been definitely for hire at all times and got mixed up

with too many of the warring factions in the Youngstown area

and that was why he was killed.

MEZZATESTA told CV-344-c to stay away from Youngstown

as it was a

mihad" town.

He said there was dissension between

various factions, and they were not organized with lines of

authority.

He amplified this by stating one group would have

control of the prosecutor, another would have the sheriff,

and another group would have the police department.

As an example,

he said when

a group would open up the barbut with the

consent of the prosecutor, the sheriff would interfere and

visa versa and this caused the bloodshed and jealousy.

MEZZATESTA stated his nephew, ANTHONY MADAFFARE,

Is no longer residing in his home but has taken a room in

the

town of Kent. He said the nephew came to the United States

on a visitor's visa and in order to halt his return to

Italy, he and MOIO arranged a marriage for several hundred

dollars with a prostitute (ROSE BRYSON) who hung out at the

NAPLES brothers sandwich shop.

MEZZATESTA stated ROSE BRYSON had called on him

on April 21, 1964. She has divorced his nephew and had

remarried, and she had stated she had been interviewed by

the INs that day but had "told them nothing" about her

marriage to MADAFFARE to stay his deportation.

CV-344-C told MEZZATESTA he had heard that his

nephew had been wanted for murder in Italy, and MEZZATESTA

stated someone was confusing his nephew with an ANGELO MACRI

He stated MACRI or MACREA had fled Italy after

murdering three or four police officers.

He had arrived in

Canada and later came to Kent, Ohio, where he stayed In his

home for about two months. He later went to New York City

where he was arrested and returned to Italy.

MEZZATESTA stated ANGELO had a brother who was

sought by the Italian Police, and they found him asleep

and killed him without giving him a chance.

Thereafter, ANGELO

was out to avenge his brother's death, and he sought out each

officer involved and killed them.

He told them they had killed

his brother when his eyes were closed, and he was killing

them with their eyes open and facing him.

cv-344-C stated in talking to VEZZATESTA he was

able to determine that although he appears to be a harmless

Italian, he is capable and apparently willing to engage in

He stated there

If he were asked to do so.

He also stated the possibility

exists that he had been an accomplice

of MOIO in several of

his bombings and arson cases, but he had given him no details.

CV-344-C stated he told MEZZATESTA that his father

had been turned down for re-entry into the United States, but

he was still working

; to try to get him back in the country.

MEZZATESTA stated at this point that 1f GUISEPPI ever came

"handouts" which would be owed GUISEPPI for his years of

silence and separation from his family, and for remaining

solid and not telling the police agencies anything.

CV-344-C stated he was surprised that MEZZATESTA

was as talkative as he had been with him, but he belzeve

he had been so as a result of his close friendship with

his father. He stated there is no doubt in his mind that

NEZZATESTA would go into the complete details of various happenings

including bombings and kIllings If GUISEPPI would return to

the area. He stated since he would be driving his father around

to meet his friends

such as MEZZATESTA and GALLO, he would also

acquire these details which would be of interest

to this Bureau.

He reiterated his father would not furnish Information, but he

could obtain the same through him and relay this to the Bureau.

The Cleveland Division, In no way wishes to be

argumentative and overly insistent in Its efforts to secure

the cooperation of the INS in getting PINDELLI Into the

United States on a parole basis; but it Is felt that his

re-entry into the United States 1s the best and most promising

avenue to obtalning the solution to the CAVALLARO murders and

others which occurred previously in the Youngstown area and

which are believed related.

The Bureau's patience and con-

sideration in this matter is appreciated.

CV-344-c himself pointed out that although there

is no doubt in his mind that through his father he can get

the true picture of these murders, including CAVALLARO'S,

this information would be not likely evidentiary. However,

It is pointed out there have been various and differing theories

of these murders reported by various informants.

If the true

story could be obtained, it would allow this division to

concentrate on obtaining evidence which might eventually

lead to the prosecution of those

responsible;

In view of the above, it is again requested that the

Bureau, through Ilalson with INS Headquarters, explore the

possibility that PINDETLI be allowed to return to the United

States on a temporary or parole basis, as it is felt his

presence will materially ald in the work of this Bureau

as well as the INS facilities.

INS has pointed out that PINDELLI If, In the United

he could be put out of the country Immediately and his presence

in the United States would in no way cause any embarrassment

ADDENDUM:

(FEB)

Information has just come to my attention to the

effect that CV-344-0 may himself soon be the victim of a gang

land killing.

This Information 1s being set out here as a part of

the over-all consideration the Bureau should give to my

recommendation that effort be made through INS to return

GUISEPPI PINDELLI to this country.

On November 25, 1963, CV-554-PC advised that on

that date he had been in wheeling, West VIrginia, and in

touch with PAUL HANKISH who had just been released from the

penitentiary on a burglary sentence.

Cv-554-pc said that

BILL LIAS was currently boss in wheeling and that from what

HANKISH told him there may be, in the not too distant future,

a struggle for power in wheeling between LIAS and HANKISH.

On January 17, 1964, when HANKISH entered his auto-

mobile parked in front of his

residence in Wheeling 1t blew

up, apparently as the result of a bomb being placed in 1t.

HANKISH was critically Injured and both legs amputated.

of his hands were badly mangled.

HANKISH Informed local

authorities he blamed LIAS for responsibility in the bombing.

the hospital, and on

March 4, 1964, the Informant said HANKS!

nnton that

Is of the definite opinion that LIAS was responsible for the

bombing.

HANKISH told the informant he had been in touch with

Individuals in Detroit and New Jersey regarding the bombing, and

they told him they would obtain satisfaction for him and "take

care of the Greek"

HANKISH told the Informant that apparently

At that time, HANKISH apparently did not know who did the

actual bombing.

The informant said that on about February 25, 1964,

visit felt that ROSS is the type of Individual HANKISH might

use to retaliate against LIAS.

on March 17, 1964, CV-554-PC advised he had

learned that AL ROSS of Pittsburgh was going to

BENNY

PINDELLL and EARL DE ANGELIS.

He said he had also learned

that ROSS had come close to "dumping" DE ANGELIS and PINDELLI

four or five days ago.

Informant did not know whether this

Involved the HANKISH bombing but felt It was connected with

1t.

CV-554-PG said that both DE ANGELIS and PINDELLI, whom

he knows, are capable of having done the HANKISH job.

On April 29, 1964, CV-554-pc advised that on the

preceding weekend he had visited HANKISH and learned that

HANKISH 1s virtually positive that BENNY PINDELLI and one

other unknown Individual set up the HANKISH bombing.

The

Informant had also talked with an Individual known to him

only as

"BIG RED", who is a good friend of HANKISH and who has

houses of prostitution in and around Wheeling, west Virginia

and Reading, Pennsylvania.

"BIG RED" told the informant that

RED had warned HANKISH when BENNY PINDELLI was coming around

Wheeling.

He said apparently HANKISH was prepared for anyone

who might shoot at him but was not prepared for the bombing.

Informant is of the opinion HANKISH is waiting for the right

time to take care of both PINDELLI and LIAS and belleves

HANKISH will have the job done by AL RoSs.
