telegrams in full but generally related to KGB personnel

the contents of the telegrams.

Informant stated that one of the first things

mentioned by Colonel IVANOV was the fact that when the

chiefs of the KGB New York Residencies In NY

and Washington,

became aware of the fact that NOSENKO wass in the

united states, and that someone from the soviet Embassy would

be permitted to confront him, the chiefs of the two residencies,

namely IVANOV Of the New York Residency and ALEKSANDR FOMIN

According to BORIS IVANOV, ALEKSANDR FOMIN

suggested that the man to carry out this assignment was

ALEKSEI

• P. KOSIKOV.

Informant described KOSIKOV as a member of the

Consular Group ou theSoviet Embassy in Washington, D.C.

He stated that KOSIKOV is a KGB employee.

Informant

said that he did not know whether KOSIKOV is an employee

of the 13th Department, Ist Directorate KGB.

Colonel BORIS IVANOV explained to KGB personnel

that he felt that KOSIKOV would not be arrested and detained

by US authorities for killing NOSENKO inasmuch as NOSENKO

Is a Soviet citizen, and that KOSIKOV, in killing NOSENKO

would not be committing a crime against the us or any

eitizen of the US.

IVANOV stated that after it had been decided by

FOMIN and himself that the above was the best course of

action to follow in this matter, he and FOMIN collaborated

on a telegram which they sent to KGB Headquarters in Moscow

outlining their plan.

IVANOV related, however,

that one day

later they received a reply from Moscow which was signed

"VLADIMIROV the KGB code name for SEMICHASTNY, the head

of the KGB)S)IVANOV said that in this telegram, Moscow

replied that theCentral Committee of the CP did not agree

with the recommendation of IVANOV and FOMIN "for now'

IVANOV

said it was written that "We will do this later, this 1s not

the proper moment"

According to the informant, IVANOV said that the

above telegram was the first of two telegrams to which

IVANOV telered during his conference with KGB personnel.

IVANOV said that when it was determined that KBB Headquarters

in Moscow would not allow NOSENKO to be killed, then It was

decided that another man from the Consulör Group at the

Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C. would be sent to

confront

NOSENKO. This man was not a

KGB employee, but was "clean"

Informant said that Colonel IVANOV stated he

is convinced that NOSENKO defected because of a lack of

morality.

IVANOV said it is his opinion that NOSENKO

planned this whole thing for a long time.

IVANOV further

commented that it is especially difficult for him to

understand NOSENKO's actions inasmuch as NOSENKO's father

was a close personal friend of Premier KHRUSHCHEV.

Informant was then asked if it was unusual

that

NOSENKO, an employee of the Second Directorate of

KGB in Moscow, should be selected to accompany the

Soviet

Disarmament Delgation to Geneva, Switzerland, it being

noted that the specific function of the Second Directorate

is to perform counter-intelligence duties against

foreigners in the Soviet Union.

Informant replied that

it is not unusual for employees of the Second Directorate

to be selected for such missions. He said that on the

contrary, it is

considered quite

an honor among personnel.

such assignments. He

said these assignments are eagerly sought and jealously
