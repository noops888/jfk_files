Tampa airtel 2/5/63 revealed SISS planned to reschedule

in near future recently postponed hearings concerning FPCC. Concern

was expressed over possibility TP 27-S might be subpoenaed and request

was made that Bureau consider requesting SISS not to subpoena TP 27-S

as such action might jeopardize his future value.

TP 27-S is former

Communist Party member who is presently active in IPCC and is serving

on the Executive Board of the Tampa Bay Chapter of the FPCC. He

is a paid informant who is furnishing Bureau on a continuing basis

InTormatIon concerning FPee, data regarding Communist Party members

in Tampa area, and information concerning the Proletariat Party of

America.

On confidential basis Inspector Wick determined from

Subcommittee representative that hearings concerning Tampa FPCC would

Obe held in near future but that dates of hearings and list of witness

had not yet been completed.

In connection with Congressional hearings, Tampa airtel

disclosed that, during conversation with Chief Neil G. Brown of the

Tampa Police Department, SAC, Tampa, indicated the SISS, as an

investigative agency of

access to information developed by investigative agencies of the

Executive Branch through the Attorney General.

Since this statement

could be subject to misinterpretation, we are instructing Tampa to

be sure Chief Brown understands that FBI files are confidential and

oh the foule cano files is furnished only to authorized agenciesty

'SAC, Tampa, also made statement that informa-

tion affecting the public safety of the community would be furnished

Memorandum for Mr. Sullivan

to the Police Department and would not be passed to other agencies.

This statement is also subject to misinterpretation and we are

advising SAC,

lampa, to be sure that Chief Brown understands that

information concerning the public safety of the community would be

given to him and to other interested agencies.

OBSERVATIONS:

If leaders and principal members of the Tampa Bay Chapter

of FPCC are to be subpoenaed by the Subcommittee, it would be to oux

advantage and that of TP 27-S to be subpoenaed along with the other..

members as his absence would undoubtedly pinpoint him to the member-

ship as an informant.

Appropriate action concerning the issuance

of a subpoena for TP 27-S will be made when list of witnesses available

RECOMMENDATIONS:

If you agree,

(1) Contact will be maintained by Mr. DeLoach's office

with Subcommittee representative in order that list of witnesses might

be obtained and appropriate action concerning the issuance of a

subpoena concerning TP 27-S taken. U

Being

(2) Attached airtel will be sent to Tampa advising that

subconittee hearings are to be held in near future but that dates

of hearings not set nor list of witnesses completed and that appro-

priate action concerning subpoena will be taken when list of witnesses

is available. Also, that Chief Brown understands that information in

FBI files is

only furnisned to authorized Government agencies and that

information concerning public welfare of the community would be

disseminated to him, along with interested Government agencies.
