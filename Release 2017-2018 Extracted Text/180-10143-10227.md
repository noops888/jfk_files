military. He said it consisted primarily of briefing the military on

items of mutual interest. He said the CIA had tried to work with clan-

destine units of the military, including the Army (he said the Navy

had no clandestine units), but it was the opinion of the CIA that the

military had too low a degree of professionalism for the successful

operation of clandestine projects. Casasin stated that during this

time the military said it was actually running operations, but it was

never confirmed by the CIA and they found no evidence of such military

operations.

Casasin identified two military intelligence personnel in the

Casasin said, however, that the Navy did provide some operational

support for his base. It consisted of providing

Casasin said he cannot recall any specific information that the

military was using American military personnel in any of its operations

He said, however, that there was occasional rumors that an American

serviceman was trafficking with suspected foreign subversives. He said

the individual intelligence agencies would have handled any such cases.

He stated that he never heard any concrete information of American

contact with the Soviets.

I referred Casasin to CIA Document 435-173-A, which is a memo

dated 25 November 1963 from Thomas B. Casasin to Walter P. Haltigan

on Mr. Lee Harvey Oswald. Casasin says he does remember the memo.

I asked him to explain the cover memo dated 12 December 1963 by Robert

G. Lamprell to Chiefs of SR and WH re: GPFLOOR-Lee Harvey Oswald.

2 Casasin explained that Lamprell (whose real name was

he died of cancer a few years ago) was one of Casasin's

contacts

He said that Lamprell was the Senior Officer in

the Soviet Office in

Station, and served as the second in 3

command. Casasin said that walter Haltigan (whose real name was

was his normal contact

He surmised that his memo

was sent out by Lamprell because Haltigan might not have been availablel

He does not know the reason for the delay between the date of his

memo, 25 November, and the transmission by Lamprell, 12 December.

Casasin said he recalls that he wrote the memo spontaneously

when he heard a news cast about Oswald after the assassination. He

recognized Oswald when he heard the news information that Oswald had

lived in Minsk in the Soviet Union and had married a foreigner. He

remembered those details from State Department information he had seen.

Casasin explained the cryptonym REDWOOD as clandestine operations;

the Chief of the SR Division was responsible for that project. He

explained that was separate from the REDCAP program, which was operatio

against Soviets outside of the USSR.

Casasin explained the relationship of

Casasin said he cannot remember who served as Chief of the

while he was there. He said the deputy

chief was an older woman

near the age of retirement. He said that

Rudolf Balaban worked with him and is still at the agency; he could

probably remember the names of the others in the section.

Casasin said at the time he assumed Oswald had been sent out of

attempt to debrief Oswald.

travelled through Europe on leave with his family until Spetember,

1960. He said therefore the conversation could not have taken place

in the summer of 1960 as the memo states. He said he used the wrong

year

in the memo.

Casasin identified KUJUMP as the Operations Division. He said it

had a contacts division

said he believed he had

received maybe one State Department dispatch on the returning American.

He said the dispatch probably originated if Oswald had given up his

passport at the Embassy in Moscow and had had to reapply to the embassy

to be able to return to the United States. Casasin said he believes

Oswald's contacts with the Embassy in Moscow were initiated by

Oswald. Casasin said he only knew whatever appeared in the State Depart

ment dispatches about Oswald.

He said his statement in the memo that Oswald looked "odd" was the

CIA's evaluation of Oswald. This was based on the fact that he was

allowed to live in the Soviet Union and permitted to marry

a Soviet

citizen. Casasin said he believed some type of controlled intelligence

station

should approach Oswald; they would be able to contact and talk

to him in a perfunctory manner

for debriefing purposes.

Casasin said that during the period 1945-60 no more than 10

American defectors came to their attention from the State Department

and the military.

Casasin identified the REDSKIN cryptonym as the

program. It involved

Casasin said

believes therefore that if Oswald had been debriefed he would nave seen

the information in that form.

Casasin said he believes it is inconceivable that Oswald would

have been any type of operative of the CIA. However, he also gave his

opinion that the nature

of KGB operations made it conceivable that Os-

wald could have been a "lay-low" Soviet operative.

I asked Casasin what the reference to the "Harvey Story" in the

last line of his memo referred to. He

said at first that it must have

been some kind of

cryptonym he was using at the time. He pondered a

while. Then he said he would need some kind of prompting of his

memory. He said he doubts that it would have been someone's true name.

Casasin said he has never been contacted by anybody, including

the Warren Commission, about the memo.

He said that his interest in Oswald as expressed in the memo was

just a lead. He said the fact of no follow-up on that lead was not

unusual. He said Oswald's going to the Soviet Union was unusual, but

that left him open to the possibility of KGB contact. He therefore

ultimately was of only marginal interest to the agency.

Casasin said it was normal to not make a check for a 201 file

on a person like Oswald, meaning that it was not unusual that he did

not check for Oswald's 201. He said this was epsecially not unusual

since they had made the decision not to use Oswald. It's possible

that a colleague of Casasin's might have checked, but Casasin said

he doesn't recall any such check.

in remebering details about the branch; also, Becky Balaban, who is

Casasin said that the purpose of a 201 is to indicate that a

request had been made for provisional operational approval. He said

the file would indicate operational interest and would then refer one

to the specific office with the interest in the individual. He said

he doesn't know that actual criteria for opening 201's. He said also

that after initial interest was shown in an individual by the opening

of a 201, the number might remain with the

persen actually being developed as an asset.

showed Casasin the Personality (201) File Request form from

Oswald's 201 file. He said he had never seen it before and did not know

there actually existed a 201 file on Oswald.

Referring to the source

of the form, CI/SIG, Casasin said Ci stood for Counterintelligence.

He said he thought SIG stood for Signal Intelligence, but he was not

sure. He said that notation would mean that NSA or the military had

picked up Oswald's name in some type of transmission. He asked if Oswald

had access to any type of radio transmissions. He said he thought the

201 section of the Registry Office could answer questions about the

notations on the form.

block on the form, Casasin said he does not know what it stood for.

I asked him if he understood why some of the notations were crossed

out and new notations had been made; he said he could not explain that.

He said he thought the Permanent Charge notation meant that the file

would stay in the Office of Registry and that the file therefore had no

operational significance. In this file he said he thought it would be

routine to open a file on defectors such as Oswala, so it may have had

some other office charge because of

that. He said

did not

have an interest in the Oswald file.

â€¢ I asked how he would have come across the State Department commu-

nications on Oswald. He said the normal distribution of such State

Department information would mean that the dispatches would be circu-

lated for information and then routed back to registry where they would

be kept on file as Third Agency documents. He said he believes from

the dispatches he saw on Oswald that they

were in a consecutive series

as received from the State Department. He believes from the memo that

he must have seen several such dispatches with information about Os-

wald.

Casasin explained the operational interest various divisions

within the agency might have in this way:

He said he believes the 201 Personality form in Oswald's file is

passive and not operational and sees nothing to indicate operational

interest. He said the above scheme means that only the line divisions

would carry the operations, and he does not see any indication of such

an interest on the form.

The fact that only Counterintelligence is

indicated on the form

seems to preclude any operations.

Casasin talked further about suspicions about Oswald. He expressed

the feeling the Oswald

and Marina got their visas to leave the Soviet

Union too easily. He expalined the

"unusual behavior" of Oswald as

being his defection: his reasons were unknown, he seemed disoriented,

he married a Russian. Casasin said that while he does not believe Os-

wald was sent back to the United States by the Soviets, he cannot pre-

clude that possibility.

I asked if the Americans were able to follow Oswald's activities

while he was living in the Soviet Union. Casasin said he doesn't believ

we were able to monitor him inside the USSR. He said it would have

been too risky

I asked if Oswald's threat at the Embassy in Moscow to reveal

military secrets to the Soviets wouldn't have made Oswald of more

intelligence interest. Casasin said if he had revealed secrets he

would have been of interest for security.

I asked Casasin if a memo would have existed from the time of

the conversation referred to in his 1963 memo about interest in Oswald.

He said he doesn't think so; he said it was not customary to write

memos about such leads which were discussed

and not follow up. He does

not remember preparing any such memo.
