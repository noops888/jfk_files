Following is a translation of

a report on the subject:

- The

Mission of Luther KING with the Italian Left", dated

28 September 1964 and attributed to DEPLENARY/7, from Luigi

PINTOR, fron information coming into the editorial offices

Of L'UNITA. The Station received the report on I October 1964.p5luH

"Luther KING, noted Protestant negro Pastor and 'leader

of the anti-racist movement in the United States, met with

various leaders of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) and of

3. Given the source of the above report, we view it with

some reserve.

• In this connection, we noted the 19 September

issue of L'UNITA, which reflected an article on KING's private

audience with Pope Paul held the preceding day. According to

KING stated that "Pope Paul was most clear on the fact that both

ne, personally, and the Catholic Church support the cause of

civil rights".

The article also states that in a press conter-

ence held at Fiumicino Airport after the audience KING said,

• Pope will shortly make a public statement on racial seg-

regation. We have no other information at this time.

Attached is a copy of the report which we have passed

to the local ODENVY representative.
