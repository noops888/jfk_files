The Miami Office by letter dated May 8, 1952,

reported that John Ia Pilcher, Assistant Chief, U. S. Border

Patrol, Miami, advised on May 2, 1952, that Faward William Murphy,

a pilot, departed from International Airport, Miami, at

4:00 P.M., May 1, 1952, in a plane and that his passengers,

Aureliano Sanchez Arango and Raul Rodriguez Santos, Piloher atated

that he had learned that Murphy and the two companions were then

en route from Nassau to Caicos Island, which is located about 250

miles east of the Island of Cuba and about 400 miles north of the

Dominican Republic.

Pilcher stated that Arango and Santos came

into the United States on March 17, 1952, along with Prio, from

Mexico, and that he had heara rumors of a nonspecific type to

the effect that Prio and some of his associates are planning a

revolution to overthrow Batista.

Pilcher, on May 5, 1952, advised the Miami Office that

Ithe flight plan filed on behalf of Murphy indicated his plane.

arrived in Nassau at 5:00 P.M. on May 1, 1952 from Miami.

Pilcher

reported that the Nassau Civil Aeronautics Authorities observed

the activities of the plane and reported it did not leave until

12:59 P.M., May. 2, 1952, at which time Murphy and his two

passengers departed for Caicos Island, British West Indies. They

announced to Civil Aeronautics Authorities that they would return

May 3, 1952. According to Pilcher, this plane, piloted by Murphy,

landed at 4:15 P.M., May 2, 1952, at Santiago de Cuba, without.

It then went to Camaguey, Cuba; on the following

morning and took off from Camaguey at about

11:33 A.M., May 3, 1952,

and arrived at Miami International Airport at 2:00 P.M. on the

same day, without passengers.

This plane was met at international

Airport, upon arrival, by Pilcher, who interviewed Murphy concerning

his passengers, but Murphy refused to answer any questions:

The Miami Office by teletype of May 12, 1952, has

advised that the Immigration and Naturalization Service manifest

on Pan American Airways flight 406 March 19, 1952 reflects that

Jose Luis Francisco Fernandez Espinosa, age 28, a Cuban national,

Livio Hermogenes Peralta Recojo, age 42, a Cuban national, ano

Ricardo Florencio Suarez Rodriguez, age 25, a Cuban national,

travelled as a party from Havana, Cuba, to Miami, Florida, and

were all destined to the Leamington Hotel, Miami.

These apparently

are the individuals whom M-1 reported went to Miami on March 19,

1952, to confer with former President Prio and from the airline

manifest it appears that M-l, referred to above, is Suarez Rodriguez.
