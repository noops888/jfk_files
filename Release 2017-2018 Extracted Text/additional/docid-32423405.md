AMLASH Case OffiCeI. YeS.

Mr. Johnston. Is that satisfactory to you?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes.

MI. Johnston. Now, you understand that at any time we

refer to your participation or your authorship ofa document or

receipt of a document, we are prepared to substantiate the

reference that we are making, and we are not trying to avoid

proving the fact that it is indeed you that were involved in

the incident. It is simply because we were not able to use

your name.

AMLASH Case Officer. That's right.

Mr. Johnston. Now, you've previously testified before this

Committee, and I assume you've had a copy of the Committee

rules, and we have another copy available in case you want to

refer to them.

And are you appearing here voluntarily today without

& counsel?

AMLASI Case Officer. Yes, I am.

Mr. Johnston. Do you understand that at any point during

this examination you are free to stop answering any questions

and request the advice of Counsel?

AMLASH Case Officer. I do.

Mr. Johnston. And do you understand as well that all your

constitutional rights are intact here before the Committee

AMLASH Case Officer. I do.

Mr. Johnston. All right.

Let me state that the purpose of this interview is to

refine and clarify certain questions about the AMLASH operation.

It is my understanding that you were the case officer on

the AMLASH operation from the time period, say, of the first

of September on through, for all relevant purposes, December "6.1,

and November '64, is that correct?

AMLASH Case Officer. That's right.

MI. Johnston. At this time you were a member of what was

called the Special Affairs Staff, is that correct?

AMLASH Case Officer. That's right.

Mr. Johnston. And that's abbreviated SAS.

AMLASH Case Officer. Right.

=:

Mr. Johnston. Would you describe your position in SAS

and your relationship to Mr. Fitzgerald, who was Chief of

SAS?

AMLASH Case Officer. I was a special assistant to Mr.

Fitzgerald, charged with the responsibility of attempting tom

organize a military coup inside Cuba against Fidel Castro.

MI. Johnston. Did you report directly to MI. Fitzgerald

or your work?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, I did.

MI. Johnston. What was the relationship betwean SAS and

the western Hemisphere Division under, at that time, I believe,

MI. J. C. King?

AMLASH Case Officer. I don't recall exactly what the

organizational relationship was at that time. I do know that

we operated on a somewhat -- I wouldn't say autonomous basis

from the Division itself, but the chain of command was certainly!

from MI. Fitzgerald, not necessarily through the Division

Chief, but up to the DDP at that time.

MI. Johnston. Who was Mr. Helms.

AMLASH Case Officer. That's right.

MI. Johnston. In other words, there could be direct

reporting from Mr. Fitzgerald to Mr. Helms.

AMLASH Case Officer. Oh, yes.

Mr. Johnston. Is: it necessary that Mr. King was knowledgeable

of all operations of SAS?

AMLASH Case Officer. Not necessarily. I don't know if he

was kept fully advised of all the operations or not.

MI. Johnston. Did he know generally what you were doing?

AMLASH Case Officer. I presume he did, yes.

meet to coordinate. They do coordination of their work?

AMLASH Case Officor, I don't know. I wasn't involved

in that part of it.

MI. Johnston. Was SAS targeted directly at Cuba, or

were there other countries under its jurisdiction?

AMLASH Case Officer. No. SAS was strictly a task force

set up to deal with the Cuban problem.

Mr. Johnston. And finally on this general matter, who

did -- who gave the counterintelligence support for SAS operations?

AMIASH Case Officer. We had a Counterintelligence Branch

within SAS.

Mr. Johnston. Who headed that in the fall of '63?

AMLASH Case Officer. I don't recall. There was a change.

I don't recall the name.

MI. Johnston. Let me -- as I stated earlier, you of

course have testified before, and I have before me the

transcript and I'm not proposing really to trap you in any natuge

with this transcript. However, there are some things that were

not asked before that I would like to clarify.

First of all, how and why was AMLASH first contacted to

set up the September meeting that you attended?

AMLASH Case Officer. He had been contacted the year before

in Helsinki, and we found out at that time that he was coming

out to a sporting event in the Western Hemisphere, so we went

down and contacted him.

MI. Johnston. In my review of the file -- and I don't think

we have the document here today, but my notes indicate there

was a cable from Langley to Rome on 19 June 1963, that is in

the AMLASH file.

AMLASH Case Officer. Would you repsat. the quastion?

MI. Johnston. In my review of the AMLASH file, there is

a cable from headquarters to Rome on 19 June 1963 which states

that WIP,, who was your contact with AMLASH, had sent a letter

as part of "an activation effort to reluctant dragon."

I ask. , do you have any recollection or any knowledge

that this was a sign to AMLASH that CIA was back in contact

with him or wanted to go back in contact with him?

AMLASH. Case Officer. I can't comment on that because

I didn't get into the operation until September of '63, and

this took place before I became involved in that part of the

AMLASH operation.

Mr. Johnston.

So in other words, you're saying you don't

really know who made the contact with AMLASH?

AMLASH Case Officer. We had contact with AMLASH from the

year before. He had been contacted by a CIA case officer in

Helsinki.

Mr. Johnston. In July and Mugust, 1962.

AMLASH Case Officer. Rinht.

Mr. Johnston. Then he returned to Cuba.

AMLASH Case Officer. And this was the first time, to

the best of my knowledge, that he had come out from Cuba

since the Helsinki trip.

MI. Johnston. In other words, you're not aware of any

prior contact between CIA or an intermediary and AMLASH?

AMLASH Case Officer. Not between that period of time.

MI. Johnston. All right. You met with AMLASH in Brazil

September 5th through 9th. I don't mean you specifically,

but the general meetings with AMLASH were in that time frame.

Is that your recollection?

AMLASH Case Officer. That's right.

Mr. Johnston. Do you recall seeing a cable, or receiving

instructions from headquarters to the effect - and this is

after your series of meetings -- instructions to the effect

that headquarters felt that AMLASH appeared hopeless as an

intelligence performer, and should be approached as a chief

conspirator allowed to recruit his own cohorts. He should

be urged to recruit a few trusted friends to assist him

initially in FI and ops reporting and then progress to sabotage

and more serious matters on

a more orderly basis.

Do you recall seeing something to that effect after your

Brazil meetings with him?

AMLASH Case Officer. I don't specifically recall the cable

itself, but certainly that would be in line with the thinking

at that time.

If I may state, he was not considered a controlled asset,

shall wa say, and it was somebody with whom

we felt that we

could collaborate in organizing the internal group.

Mr Johnston. But my summary of the cabla would indicate

thut on September 9th, or after your meetings in Brazil, you

really didn't think of him as a gatherer of information, but

as someone who wanted to go on to other things, as a

conspirator of some kind.

AMLASH Case Officer.. That's right.

MI. Johnston. The file also has a document in it, the

AMLASH file, dated 16 September, marked OFPA 72775. I don't

really know what an OFPA is.

AMLASH Case Officer. It's a dispatch.

Mr. Johnston. In any event, it reports a transcript of

the conversation, and to the best of my ability to understand

the document, it's a conversation of an intercept in thi

The document says "Mary: I don't want to

imagine things, but this thing of" AMLASH -- uses his real

name. I have sanitized this - "Moreno. It is either a

tremendous secret or a top secret matter." And then there is

unreadable portion, and then a word either "treason" or

"reason" I'm not sure what is referred to, and then a partici-

pant whose name is Betty says, "I believe it is a top secret

matter."

My question to you is, did you, in September of '63, kno

about this intercept?

AMLASH Casa Officar. I don't specifically recall today

that I would have known about it. I prosume if we had it in

file, that I was working with it, that I would have seen it.

MI. Johnston. Do you have any information about any recollet-

tion about something on this order?

AMLASH Case Officer. No.

Mr. Johnston. And assume that at least the portion I

quoted seems to reflect on the Cubans' view of AMLASH's

activities in Paris.

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, it may have. As I recall, I

think that he was

also at

that time -- I may be wrong, and we

would have to go back to the files to check, but he was rather

outspoken to some of his closer friends in the fact that he was

no longer happy with the revolution, with Castro.

MI. Johnston. I don't want to dwell on this, if you don't;

have a recollection, but this conversation seems to indicate

that the employees in the

think that AMLASH is

there on a top secret mission.

AMLASH Case Officer. Probably so because of his independent

way of comportment.

He didn't answer to anybody.

Senator Schweiker. What was his role in government at

that point?

AMLASHI Case Officer. He was -- excuse me, this must have

been '63. He was a personal representative of Castro to the

games, first in Brazil, and I don't think he had a specific

post in '63, as I recall. He had been Deputy Minister of

Interior. He had been a military attache in Spain. I don't think

he had a spocific post at that time.

Excuse me, if I may add just one more point. Before that he

had been President of the Student Federation at the University

of Havana. He may still have been in that post, or about the

time that he was getting out of it, and this is, I think, where

really the trouble between this particular fellow and the Castro.

brothers more or less came to ahead.

MI. Johnston. On the 19th of September, Jim Wave sent a

message to headquarters basically warning, giving a warning,

making the statement that there was an anti-Communist group in

Cuba, and the name AMLASH is part of that group, and it concluded

by saying that Fidel is allegedly aware of both the anti-communist

group and a Communist group, and that he acts as a moderator

between them in order to maintain cohesion in the government of

Cuba.

Do you recall receiving that information?

AMLASH Case Officer. I don't recall specifically receiving

that information, but I do recall that at that time Fidel

Castro himself was

talking about -- was concerned about a

Communist takeover of the revolution, and he did meet with the

subject and some other friends of his in order to prevent this.

MI. Johnston.

When was this?

AMIASIl Case Officer.

This was in the early '60s sometime.

Union?

MI. Johnston. Before Castro's trip?

MI. Wallach. Right.

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes.

MR. Johnston. The question being put is after your

meeting in Brazil with AMLASH, Jim Wave cabled headquarters that

AMLASH was part of a group of anti-Communist Cuban government

leaders and that Castro was

aware of that fact.

AMLASH Case Officer. My answer to you is that he certainly

was because he had been

talking with these people, including

-.-

AMLASH, a year before.

Yes.

Senator Schweiker. Castro was aware that he was anti-

Communist?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, that he was one of the anti-

Communist group.

Senator Schweiker. Why would he be so trusted and be the

special representative at that point in time if he war: known

as anti-Communist?

AMLASH Case Officer. Because of the relationship with

Castro. Castro himself had not declared his Communist, more of

less intentions, as of that time.

Senator Schweiker. Wait, this was after the Cuban missile

crisis. This was '63, and the Cuban missile crisis was '62.

I'm confused here.

AMLASH Case Officer. Let's go back to the dates here.

Senator Schweiker.

The Jim Wave date is September 1963,

and he knows at this point, allegedly now, that this AMLASH

was a member of an anti-Connunist group. I have trouble

reconciling that with not pinpointing AMLASH and his possible

subversive agent. I think that is what Jim is getting to.

AMLASH Case Officer. Again, my answer is I don't know

specifically why or what the origin of the '63 J. M. Wave

cable was.

My answer again

to the question is that Castro, from his

previous knowledge, going back to '62, did know and had consulted

with this group of people of which AMLASH was one, who were the

group of Anti-Communist officers in the revolution.

MI. Johnston. So --

AMLASH Case Officer. I don't know why in '63 this report

would have come out, but it would confirm Castro's knowledge

of this group, yes.

MI. Johnston. Let me move on

into October. There was a

meeting with AMLASH.

Senator Schweiker. How long did he tolerate anti-Communist

officers in high positions in his government? I've got to

beliave there's some cutoff here. I realize the unigueness and

broadness of his support earlior, but it would just seem to me

that at some point he really had to weed out, nottnecessarily

weed out of be suspect of anti-Communist officers who had too

high decision making in his government, would he not, or am I

missing something?

AMLASH Case Officer. No, not really, because out of this

group that was mentioned, and with whom he himself discussed

the need in the early '60s to keep, say, the Communists out,

some of those officers are still in his goverment today.

Now, they may have changed, or Castro may have changed, but

he didn't purge all this group of officers. Maybe he won them

over, and if they are still there, evidently he has some

confidence in them.

MI. Johnston. According to the file, there was a meeting on

October 5th, apparently, in Paris, and I'm not sure that you were

the case officer at that meeting, and the cable from Paris

sets the tone of that meeting as AMLASH apparently was trying

to get things off his chest in

talking to you.

were you the case officer at that meeting?

AMLASH! Case Officer. I was the case officer during that

period of time.

Go into a little of the detail because we did talk about

these problems.

In early October 1963, the first meeting on dr about October

5th that AMLASH comes in and says I want to get things off my

chest, and seems to express great dissatisfaction with the

CIA's position.

Then there's a second meeting on October 13th or so where

he specifically asks to meet with Robert Kennedy, and you

previously testified about that second meeting.

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes.

Mr. Johnston.

Now, the file indicates there was an

earlier meeting on October 5th, and AMLASH was complaining

apparently about the low level espionage matters that had been

discussed in Brazil, and implying that he had a more valuable

role to play, and the file says the case officer provided the

necessary assurances that his feelings were not in fact

true, and that his case was receiving the consideration at

the highest levels.

With this problem which had undoubtedly been bothering

AMLASH off his chest, a much more relaxed AMLASH departed,

stating his desire to return to Cuba to undertake the big

job.

Do you recall that

meeting?

AMLASH Case Officer. I think you are getting those two

meetings mixed up. In other words, the later one, yes. I

was there and talking to him in the second meeting. In the

first meeting I don't recall precisely, but there could have

he knew that the other officer was a frlend of mine, and he

meeting when he first arrived in Paris, and the meeting that he

had -- I don't recall specifically.

I do recall, if I may, I do recall that he said he was

unhappy because of the Ic-juirements, the intelligence reguir.-

ments that we had levied on him in Brazil, and it is true that

his position was at that time, even in Brazil, and later in

Paris, that he was not disposed to cooperate just to furnish

intelligence. In other words, he felt that he wanted to do

something about the removal of Castro but was not just prepared

to keep us advised as to what was going on. He recognized that

this was certainly part of a needed operation, but he did not

consider himself just as a provider of information.

MI. Johnston.

Let me go off the record for a minute

because I want to use a code name.

(Discussion off the record.)

MI. Johnston.

Having

mentioned the code name that is

used in this cable, you now recall you were at the 5 October

meeting?

AMLASH Case Officer.

Yes.

Mr. Johnston. And the cable, you can look at it, indicates

that AMLASH was in a confessional mood.

My question to you is, after recalling that meeting, was

it basically one where

he was expressing his concern about

the CIA role for him?

MI. Johnston.

He was expressing his concern for what?

MI. Johnston. The CIA!a plans for using him.

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes. He was concerned as to how and

in what way he was to cooperate with CIA. He was also -- and

we must underline this, right from the beginning, dubious

as to our resolve to really follow through on initiating a

coup against Castro.

Mr. Johnston. Is the cable correct in stating that he was

assured that his case was receiving consideration at the

highest levels?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes.

Mr. Johnston. Was the word "highest level" used, or was

a name used?

AMLASH Case Officer. Highest levels, but at that stage

of the game he knew he was talking to CIA, so highest levels

in CIA is what was meant at that particular time.

Mr. Johnston. That's the word you used?

You didn't say Director McCone?

AMLASI Case Officer. I did not use names, no.

Mr. Johnston.

On October 5th, you reassured him that his

consideration, that his case was receiving consideration at

least at the highest levels of CIA, and the cable reflects

that when he left that meeting he seemed much more relaxed about

the case.

Is that an accurate portrayal of the meeting?

AMLASI! Case Officer. That's right.

Mr. Johnston. As. I mantioned; thera was another meeting

on or about October 13th, where, as I understand it, AMLASH

made his demand or his request to meet with Robert Kennedy, and

he made that request to meet with Kennedy by name.

Is that correct?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, he did.

Well, he said somebody such as, somebody high in the

administration, again, to receive the assurances that we were

prepared to - that we were serious about developing and

organizing a coup.

MI. Johnston. After that meeting, you were recalled to

Langley for discussions, is that correct?

AMLASH Case Officer. I was traveling back and forth

between Paris and Langley, yes. I don't recall if I was

recalled at that particular time, but I would go there --I

waS TDY.

Mr. Johnston. I want to set the stage. There is a

message from the Director, 15683, to London, directing you to

return to headquarters for discussion of all facets of the

case.

This. is after you reported that AMLAS!l wants to meet

with someone like Robert Kennedy.

Do you recall that flow of events?

Mr. Johnston. What discussions did you have at Langley,

discussions at Langley came a decision to go to Paris with

of Robert Kennedy?

AMLASH Case Officer.

That's right.

Mr. Johnston. Then you met on October 29, according to

the file, with AMLASH, MI. Fltzgerald, in Paris.

Is that correct?

AMLASH Case Officer. Excuse me. Can I go off the

record?

(Discussion off the record.)

ME. Wallach. I think you stated that AMLASH said that he

would like to meet with one of the U.s. leaders such as

Robert Kennedy?

AMLASH Case Officer. A high representative in the U.s.

GoveInment.

Mr. Wallach. Did he mention any other names that you

recall?

AMLASH Case Officer. No, not that I recall.

M. Wallach. Just Robert Kennedy?

AMLASH Case Officer. Such

as Robert Kennedy.

MI. Wallach. Did AMLASil, to the best of your knowledge,

from what he told you, know about any prior assassination

attempts that had been run by the u.s.?

Mr. Wallach. Did he have any reason to bellove that Robert

AMLASH Case Officer. If he knew, he never mentioned it to

me.

We never discussed that.

Mr. Wallach. In other words, you didn't say to him,

how did you know that robert kennedy - or why did you pick

Robert Kennedy.

AMLASH Case Officer. No, not at all. I mean, it's a

perfectly, I think, logical name to have been mentioned at

that time, because by him, since he was the President's brother

and since he was the Attorney General, he wanted somebody high

In the Government; at one time he had mentioned the President,

you know, I want to talk to the President.

Mr. Wallach. It seems strange to me he didn't pick the

Secretary of State or someone like that.

AMLASH Case Officer. No.

Mr. Wallach. What I'm trying to get at -

AMLASIl Case Officer. He wanted somebody directly to the

President. In other words, he wanted the assurances

from the highest authority, again, from the President of

the United States.

MI. Wallach. What I'm trying to get at is we, from our

examination of the alleged assassination attempts, have also

gone into the sabotage attempts, MONGOOSE, etc, and found out

that Bobby Kennedy did play a role in the sabotage attempts.

What I'm trying to get from you is your understanding of

whether of not. AMLASH, from his Cuban side, knew that the

Xennedy's had played that role and would necessarily say I want

to talk to Robert Kennedy for that reason.

AMLASH Case Officer. No. He never mentioned it, not at

all in any way.

Mr. Johnston. Let me finally go to the October 29th meeting,

and before we went on the record this morning, you were

explaining to us how you characterized the AMLASH operation.

Would you repeat in summary form what you told us before

we went on the record?

AMLASH Case Officer. The operation was never conceived,

certainly, carried out during the period I was associated with

it, but was never conceived as an assassination plot. It was

conceived as a coup in order to organize a military group

within Cuba to overthrow Castro.

Mr. Johnston. Did you have the understanding that if

necessary AMLASH was proposing to assassinate the Castro

brothers?

AMLASH Case Officer. Assassination was not a subject of

discussion that came up at every meeting or contact that we

had with AMLASH. It was so stated by him that he felt that

the only way to initiate a coup

in Cuba was to direct the

since ve vere not tilling to discuss specifically alininating

Castro, this was never discussed in terms of the operation.

We certainly had no doubt that in his mind this was the only

way to go about it.

MI. Johnston. And you dealt with him on that basie?

AMLASH Case Officer. Trying to temporize this, and 1f

possible we were not looking.for a bloody coup at that time,

planning a bloody coup inside Cuba, but we were trying to

sertainly get him to think in terms of much more than just the

elimination of the leadership.

Mr. Johnston. And to broaden it.

AMLASH Case Officer. To broaden it into a coup. Our

interest was the coup, not the specifics of how he got it

started.

MI. Johnston.

You: were: concerned about whether his

plans were realistic, weren't you?.

AMLASH Case Officer. Very definitely, yes.

Senator Schweiker.

Did you personally evaluate AMLASH

as fully capable of leading a coup and being able to implement

it and carry it out if support were given?

How did you evaluate AMLASH?

As I understand from the dialogue here, and also from

reading a summary of these, at first the operations talk was

fairly low level sabotage, which he out of hand rejected, and

he pictured himselt as a leader of a top lovel effort on the

condition that it had assurances of government support and top

level support here.

Now, I guess my question to you 1s, how, as case officer.

did you evaluate his capability? Did you evaluate him as

someone who could lead a coup and who would, that our government

could put trust in, faith in in terms of his abillty to carry it

out or not?

AMIASH Case Officer. At that time we did not evaluate

him as the leader of a coup. le was not our candidate to be

the next ruler of Cuba. He was only evaluated in our dealings

with him on the basis of what he and his group could contribute

to a coup inside Cuba.

So I don't recall at any time that he was selected or that

anybody ever talked of him as the next leader in Cuba.

MI. Baron. Wasn't there some thought that he would be a

good rallying point for strong leaders of a new government in

Cuba, that he had an ability to attract good people to work with

him?

AMLASIl Case Officer. He had proven this because he had

been one of the two leaders, or the two top leaders of the

Directorado Revolutionario, which is the Revolutionary Directorate

which is a group not part of the 26th of July Movement, but a

separate group, which is - he was one of the leaders, and

became a military commander of that group, separate from the 26

so he had a group in the DR which we knew about, and he

afforded himself very well in the fighting -- this was in the

province of lasvillas, during the time that Castro was -- he

was in a separato area of the country.

MI. Baron. I had a recollection which I haven't checked

against our transcripts that when we discussed this before,

you had said although AMLASH might not be considered the leader

of a new government, that he was a potential candidate for that

job. He might not be a good military leader, but he would have

an ability to bring good people together in a new government.

AMLASH Case Officer. Of the people left in Cuba at that time,

we didn't have much of a choice.

I mean, you know, we weren't

in contact. He was one of the few who could travel.

Senator Schweiker. You put him up near the top but not

necessarily at the top.

AMLASH Case Officer. That's right, as one being able to

contribute.

Senator Schweiker. And you didn't have too many options

at that point.

Mr. Johnston. One of the documents that CIA previously

provided us in a sanitized version is a memorandum for the

record dated 19 November 1963, and the subject is Plans for

AMLASH Contact, and let me just show you that and ask you

I believe I prepared the memorandum

from which that extract was made, yes.

Mr. Johnston. When did you prepare that?

AMLASH Case Officer. It had to be late October sometime.

Mr. Johnston. November 19th is the date.

AMLASH Case Officer. Early November, certainly after

my October meeting with him in Paris, and before going back,

19 November, that's probably it.

MI. Johnston. Is that the date you prepared it?

AMLASH Case Officer. That's the date I prepared it. I

don't remember when I returned from Paris after the October-

meetings.

Mr. Johnston. You prepared a memorandum for the record

on the contact before you went to the meeting in Paris on

November

that you would show AMLASHl a copy of the President's speech in

I talked to him about it, but I don't recall having shown him

the speech. But it was probably clear that I could have taken

a copy of that speech to him and shown 1t to him.

Mr. Johnston. Paragraph 4 of that document states..

would you just read it?

AMLASH Case Officer. "Chief SA has requested wiltten

reports on AMIASHl operation be kept to a minimum."

MI. Johnston. And that's Desmond Fitzgerald, is that

correct?

AMIASH Case Officer. That's correct.

Me. Johnston. Did MI. Fitzgerald tell you that on

November 19th?

AMLASH Case Officer. It might not have been the first

time he mentioned this because -- in other words, on sensitive

operations it was always a case of trying to limit the number

of people aware of sensitive operations and this certainly is

considered in that category.

He reiterated, I presume, since I put it in the memo at

that time that the written communications would be minimized.

MI. Johnston. And this is a memorandum for record.

AMLASII Case Officer. Remember also this is primarily the

cahles because I had to communicate with headquarters and the

station in Paris. I didn't have my independent communications.

AMLASIl Case Officer. Normally, yes.

Mr. Johnston. So there's nothing unusual in your preparing

AMLASH Case Officer. No, there wasn't anything unusual

about it. That's the usual thing unless advised to the contrary.

Mr. Johnston. The last time you testified before the

Conunittee you mentioned on November 22nd you had a pen-like

device with a hypodermic needle on it. This memorandum for

not have been mentioned. I don't recall when I left for Paris.

I may have left for Paris on the 21st and --

Mr. Johnston. I think that's correct.

When you left for Paris my understanding

MI. Johnston. And you had approval to show it to him?

AMLASH Case Officer. I had approval to show it to him.

MI. Johnston. The file Indicates that AMLASH was contacted

on November 20th; I belleve, in order to set up the November

22nd meeting and he was telephoned by, I assume, somebody in

Paris.

Did you arrange that or were you knowledgeable of that

fact?

AMAS Case Officer. Yes. I was going to go there to

see him. We would have made arrangements to set the meeting up.

Mr. Johnston. The cable reporting the telephone call on

November 20th states that somebody apparently was in the room

with AMLASHl when he was telephoned, and that therefore there

had to be a telephone conversation by the CIA agent calling

him and the CIA agent --

Pardon me. AMLASH asked if the meeting would be of interest

to him, and the CIA agent

said, I don't know if it's going to

be of interest to you but it's the meeting you requested. And

I ask you your understanding of what was meant by the meeting

going to give him that materiali In other words, it was given

to him?

AMIASH Case Officer. The pen devico was something again, i

It could have been part of that package.

I don't think he was

specifically asking about the pen device because we had been

so reluctant to even discuss something like this with him and

he knew it that he was primarily concerned with the caches.

MI. Johnston.

Is it correct to say that at the October

29th meeting AMLASH was happy with the U.s. policy but asking

for equipment to do the job?

In other words, he didn't want a massive amount of

equipment but he said we do need some equipment to get the

thing started.

Mr. Johnston. And that that was in his mind on November

20th.

back-up support so that you could be assured that you were not

under surveillance at the meeting?

AMLASH Case Officer. No, I took the necessary precautions

In going to the meeting to assure myself. I didn't have somebody

else following me to tell me if I had any surveillance on me.

Mr. Johnston. What about AMLASH?

MIASIl Case Officer. We don't know. I don't know if

he was counter-surveilled.

Senator Schweiker. Could AMLASIl have been a double agent?

AMLASH Case Officer. That's a good question. I can only

give you an opinion. I didn't think so then and even with

everything that has happened today, I don't think so today.

Again, that is strictly my opinion.

Senator Schweiker. In a nutshell, and I realize this is

a very difficult, complex area, why don't you think so?

AMLASI! Case Officer. Because of the power play that

was taking place in Cuba at that time between certainly the

26th of July people and Castro trying to consolidate his

position, this was the early 'Gos now, around his people and

his movement, the fact that we had information from several

sources that he was disillusioned with the revolution.

Senator Schweiker. He, meaning AlLAS!l?

MALASH Case Officer. He, AMLASH, was disillusioned.

Senator Schweiker. And he wasn't in the 26th of July?

AMLASH Case Officer. lie was not in the 26th of July.

He was DR, So he was not a member of Castro' July 26th mövement

He was one of the other revolutionary groups which had student

support primarily and urban support and compared to Castro's

rural so-called support.

So there was a struggle going on there. In other words,

this was not an imaginary type of thing. The background that

we could check did not, to the best of my recollection at any

time lead us to belleve.in our relation with him at that time

that he was playing a double game.

The other reason that I felt that way at the time was that

we had to persuade him to return to Cuba to stay. He was

ready to defect, to leave. He didn't want to come to the

United States with all the rest of the Cubans who were here

because he had stayed on, he felt, too long with the revolution.

But he was ready to leave Cuba and to defect. He was fed up

with the way life was. A lot of the travel that he did was

that he would take any opportunity to get off of the island.

ile had told us; me personally, that and this was also confirmed

by other sources.

Senator Schweiker. Wouldn't one of your reasons also

be that he is in jail now?

AMLASII Case Officer. That would be a very good reason.

I think I mentioned

that the last time, certainly when I was

talking ahout this. If he was taken back --

AMLASHI Case Officer..

We checked that I belleve the last

time, I think the last report we had was what, a couple of

years ago?

Mr. Baron. I was given the name of a CIA

contact in

Plorida who had been on the Island of Plies at one point and

said as far as he knew, although he hadn't been in Cuba for

several years, AMIASH was a prisoner, but he wasn't in prison.

He was doing some sort of hospital work which was considered

part of his rehabilitation program.

AMIASH Case Officer.

He was a doctor, wasn't he, for

the prison?

Mr. Baron. Yes.

AMLASH! Case Officer. lie had more freedom because he

was being used as a doctor for the prisoner but he still was

still on the Isle of pines.

MI. Baron. It is my understanding that he was working

as a doctor even outside the prison and again, this is just

hearsay of one contact that I called on the phone.

Mr. Wallach. Are you positive that someone just not

using his name is there, that he switched over using an alias?

You wouldn't have intelligence of that type?

AMISSIl Case Officer. No.

Mr. Wallach. I want to quickly follow-up on somethin:

that Jim and the Senator were getting at.

the subject.

Mr. Wallach.

Why?

AMLASH Case Office.

I guess we didn't want to get involved

In assassinations.

MI. Wallach. But you had them before this.

AMIASII Case Officer. I didn't know this, and certainly

In this operation the objective of this operation was not to

in and assassinate Castro but a much bigger type of progran.

Mix. Wallach. But that was the first step, or at least

the potential first step.

AMLASH Case Officer. He was convinced that was the only

first step. AMIASIl. We weren't convinced that it had to be,

at that time that it had to be the first step, and that's why

we didn't want to discuss and we didn't discuss and we were

reluctant to discuss this subject with him.

MI. Wallach. At the late October meeting I think you

said before that - what did you request that led to the giving

him of the pen, the hypodermic needle?

AMLASH Case Officer. The pen he requested was something

with which to protect himself now.

himself?

AMIASIl Case Officer. He put himself in a situation and

asked us the question. He said I may be confronted by Castro

or by Raoul or by one or the other of Castro's people in a

meeting in which I am not armed, and I may be confronted with

an accusation of plotting against the regime.

And at that time he said this would be before we are

ready to move in formenting the coup, and ho sald, I would lixe

to have something with which I can protect myself at that time.

In' fact, the words that I think I mentioned here before was,

1f I fall, I don't want to he the only one going down.

So he was seeing himself in a situation of going back into

Cuba, of being in a meeting in which he could have been, because.

again, of the relationships. Fidel Castro himself or Raoul

Castro could confront hin in their office, accuse him.

Ir. Wallach. Couldn't he use that pen offensively and

not defensively?

AMLASI! Case Officer. Yes, he could have. He was not

at that time talking about using it offensively and we weren't

discussing the offensive use of that pen.

Sanator Schweiker. Following up the point that I

switched away from as to whether Cuban intelligence might have

been trailing him or following him or observing what you were

doing with him, we have some knowledge, I gather, from a summar:

Cuban Intelligence even though he might have been a straight

single agent in terms of working with us and not a double agent

that they may well have known or monitored what in fact he was

AMIASH Case Officer. This is possible, Senator. We

had no indication at the time that they were monitoring his

certainly in Paris and the Cubans overseas knew that he was

at such a level that we never heard that they were ever given

the Interior, which did have the security services at that time

MI. Baron. Just a couple more quastions on this point.

Did you take any special precautions aside from the standard

precautions that you would take in dealing with any foreign

contact?

Were special precautions taken in dealing with AMLASHl

to guard against the prospect that he was either a double agent

or under surveillance by Cuban intelligence?

AMLASI! Case Officer, What would you mean by special

precautions?

• MI. Baron. You would have to tell me more about the

techniques that you could use, than I could tell you.

ALASI Case Officer. What I would do is to make sure

that I wasn't under surveillance in going to the meeting or

at the meeting, and we would certainly check the meeting places

to make sure that the meeting places were not under surveillanca

by them, which would adso hopefully would have picked up in

before, that he was arrested and sentenced, and as I recall,

I may be wrong but as I recall the contacts that we had with

him In Paris never surfaced in that trial. le never, as far

as the transcript that we have of the trial, he never reported.

he never testified about the contacts that he had with us.

It was only afterwards when he was in contact with the exile

group.

MI. Baron. So you never took any affirmative action

against him or investigated him or treated him in any way that

you would treat a person suspected of being a double agent

or being closely watched by an intelligence service?

AMLASH Case Officer. Not. In mounting an investigation

against him because in doing that we would have to show our

interest in him to other people, so we did not do that.

What we could do with myself and with the other knowledgo.

able people say in Paris, of him, we did do and did everything

him the newspaper article about the Kennedy speech?

him the article. To the best of my recollection, we talked about

the speech and he had, I think, at that time, the article had

already appeared in the French newspaper and he had read it.

Mr. Johnston. What did you tell him about the article?

AMLASIl Case Officer. Well, he liked the article. It

was one in which I think the Administration, as I vaguely recall,

was taking a rather positive stand.

Mr. Johnston. Was this Kennedy's speech before the

Inter-American Press Association in Miami on November 18th?

MI. Johnston. I have an extract from that.

I think it was.

your best recollection about what happened to the pen? Did

he take it with him? Did you take it with you when you left

the meeting?

‚AMLASH Case Officer. Again, as I mentioned to you the

last time, I don't remember specifically if I kept the pen and

threw it away or if he kept it.

What I do remember;was his reaction when I showed him

the pen. I can't today tell you for sure that he kept the

pen.

Mr. Johnston. It seems to me that's rather compromising

evidence, if he kept the pen and you recall that. It's also

such compromising evidence - I have difficulty believing you

would have thrown it away.

AMLASII Case Officer. Yes, because it was compromising

evidence. I had carried 'it one way. I mean I wasn't going to

carry it bach. It was nothing but a Papermate pen in which

a hypodermic needle had been inserted.

In other words, it wasn't a $10,000 piece of equipment

or anything like this.

Mr. Johnston. I agree, but it's a very compromising

piece of evidence to have around.

l'e said he wnuldn't. I specifically

remember this.

He says, and then later on he says, I'm not

going to take any compromising material back with me.

This would have been a piece of compromising, material.

He did not like the pen. The only point probably that we made

with him is that we were willing to consider, because he knew

our opposition to something like this, that we were even willing

to consider showing him something that -- whether he could

again defend himself.

He did not think it was a good idea.

Senator Schweiker. What kind of weapon or substance

could he get that would not compromise him? I'm a little

confused. He wanted something to defend himself, but he

doesn't want anything

that will compromise him.

Unless you have a disappearing weapon, what could he

possibly get that would not compromise him to take back?

AMLASIl Case Officer. Well, we were talking also about

caches inside Cuba at that time, so it could have been dropped

to hiin inside Cuba. He didn't exactly have to take it back

with him.

In other words, here again, the whole idea of this was

not to give him something there that he would be able to take

the meeting with the pen in his possession?

AMLASH Case Offiner. I cannot be positive that he didn't.

I'm almost sure that he didn't.

Mr. Johnston. Did you ever ask him for the pen back?

Do you recall asking him to give you the pen back before the

meeting concluded or after the conclusion of the meeting?

AMLASII Case Officer. Since I recollect his reaction to

It that, you know, it's no good, I just can't logically belleve

that he would have kept the pen. This is the point. But I

don't specifically recall what was done with it except that

it was probably destroyed.

In other words, you know, broken, throw the needle out

of it and break the pen.

Mr. Tohnston.

Do you recall asking him to give you the

pen back?

AMIASH Case Officer. No, but I don't recall that he

took it in the first place, because what I recall is, gee, is

that the best that you can come up with type of thing.

So he was not in any way enthused about what we had shown

MI. Johnston, Let me ask you, is it correct you did

promise him at this meeting that you would drop rifles with

telescopic sights for him in Cuba?

MIASH Case Officer. That's right.

Mr. Johnston.

Was there any mention of paying him money

to

support his coup plans?

MIASIl Case Officer. lle had never really asked for

money. In promising him full support for the coup, if money

was required I presume that could be conjecture that he could

get that also, but he did not specifically ask for money.

Mr. Johnston.

was there discussion of his escape in

the event he assassinated Castro or killed Castro but did not

pull off the coup?

AMLASI Case Officer. At the last meeting I don't believe

that was discussed.

Mr. Johnston. At your prior meeting?

AMIASIl Case Officer. If it was, it was touched upon,

but as I recall, and this is from reading the file afterward.

where this was discussed was a year later when he was in contras,

with the exile group. I thin'. it was with the exile group ta!.

ha was then concerned about, how do I get out if something

goes wrong and we can't pull the coup.

But we did not at the 22 ovenber meeting, I don't lili:

we discussed that. In fact, I'm sure ve didn't discuss it.

I don't bellove he did, I don't

belleve he did and it could very well be that what I would have

done 1s pull the hypodermic needle out of 1t, that's very

simple, and then it's just a pen, throw the pen away of keep

the pen.

It's not a complicated object, in other words. It was

very simple to just pull the hypodermic needle out of it, and

that's probably what was done. But I don't recall specifically

that I did it.

Bir. Johnston. Did you do that after the meeting was over?

AMIASH Case Officer. No, it was during the meeting, not

after.

MI. Johnston.

Now there's an indication that you got

instructions from Washington after the meeting to break off

contact with AMLASH.

Do you recall receiving those instructions or instructions

to that effect?

NILASI Case Officer. Yes, there was a cable, I

believe, as I recall. It wasn't necessarily to break off contact

with AILASH because everybody knew that that was the last

meeting. He was preparing to, we knew this, he had been preparin;

and we had been talking to him since October since he was out

about his return to Cuba.

Again, only from the record that I

read afterwards, I think a couple of drops were made to him.

In fact, the next year of something like that.

Mr. Johnston. I'm not sure exactly what was left or

what he received or what was available.

AMLASH Case Officer. And I don't know if he ever picked

them up. I don't think we know that.

Mr. Wallach. Why did he

tell you he wanted the rifles

with telescopic sights?

AMIASIl Case Officer. Well, he wanted grenades and he

wanted dynamite too to storm the headquarters later on. We

said, well, look, could you expand this somewhat too, and he

was talking about, well, yes, and we should probably attack

the radio station at the same time. It was a matter of attackiro

a building, whether it was a radio station or whatever it was.

in order to, in his mind, he was probably thinking of attacking

the headquarters, Castro's headquarters.

HI. Johnston.

Let me

refresh your recollection. In

your previous testimony with the Select Conmittee on page 114

you stated:

"When we came out of that meeting le heard the news

of President jennedy's assassination and I received a cable

after that which I thought that this was probably the reason

the whole operation was being

re-assessed.

MILAS!l Case Officer. That was strictly my thought at that

Mr. Johnston..

And on page 115 of your prior transcript

you said, "well, the whole Cuban operation, the way I interpreted

It, was being called on."

Did you receive a cable to that arrect?

AMLASH Case Officer. It was, a very cryptic cable saying,

you know, return to washington, which I was going to do anyway,

so this is why -

Mr. Johnston. Did It say to breal off contact with

AMLASH?

AMLASI Case Officer. I don't recall that it did but

it didn't make any difference because headquarters knew that

that was the last meeting with him before he was returning to

Cuba anyway.

So there was no reason to tell me to break off contact

with hin. This is what I'm trying to say.

Mr. Johnston. Supposedly the 1967 IG report, and I

don't know where they got their information, said that was an

OPIN cable.

AMIASI Case Officer. That's Operation Immediate. In

other words, It's an immediate cable. That set precedence

on the cable.

Mr. Johnston. And what does that mean for transmitting

AMLASH Case Officer. It was

transmitted before a routind

cable of a priority cable. It's just the precedence --

I didn't go into the embassy to read it, so I don't think they

brought the cable out to me but I was told to go on back to

MI. Johnston. Let me state that that cable is apparently

not in the MisSll file and the 1967. Inspector General could not

find that cable.

Does that surprise you?

AMLASH Case Officer. No, it doesn't really because

I don't think there was that much importance given to that

kind of cable at that time.

Mr. Johnston. Would you have sent your cable without

getting a cable first from them?

I could have, sure.

MI. Johnston. I'm not sure I understand the purpose

of their cable. Were you saying it's a regular thing that they

will send extra traffic?

is that keeping headquarters informed or headquarters inguiring

return or us sending a cable.

If there was any other reason for sending that cable,

I can only conjecture, I don't know, that it was because of

what had happened.

discussion?

AMIASH Case Officer. The report, as to what had taken

place, reporting that he had not thought highly of the device

that we had provided him with, that he did not intend to carry

it back, that he was pleased with the fact that we had decided

that we would put caches down for him inside Cuba, the

reaffirmation of U.S. support for his movement inside of Cuba,

the fact that he had decided definitely to return and had

made his reservations to return, and his dismay and his

reaction when he had heard that Kennedy had been assassinated

when we got to the meeting.

Mr. Johnston.

Was there a discussion about any link

between ALAS!! of your cuban operations and the Kennedy

assassination?

wanted written reports to be kept to a mimimum?

In other words, when ho sald, minimize the written

report?

AMIASIl Case Officer. In a normal report, yes. But this

certainly was a rather, again, sensitive subject that we were

talking about. He did

not accept it and I don't think that at

that time it was felt that anything else should be said about

1t.

Mr. Johnston. Why is that?

AMIASI! CaBe Officer. I don't know why. Again, because

of the sensitivity, I presume, of the subject.

MI. Johnston. And again, is lt your recollection that

Fitzgerald, is it your testimony that Iltzgerald told you not

to put a reference to the pen device in the report?

AMLASH Case Officer. I don't recall if he specifically

told me not to put it in or if when I gave him the report he

was satisfied that it was not in.

Mr. Baron. Why would a reference to the pen device be

any more sensitive than references to arms caches or suggestions

of assassinations or all the other kinds of things that were

already in the file?

AMLASH Case Officer. Because again, in conjunction with

this particular operation it was not an assassination operation

It was a coup operation. This

was one of the aberrations of the

operation which ve got involved in strictly to provide bona

fides to the man that we were dealing with and we were concerned

for his personal security.

In other words, It was not part of the operational plan

to provide him with any such devices for the purposes of

assassinating Castro. The rifles and the grenades and all of

this was something that was necessary to start a coup.

In other words, it was not directed at one particular

person.

I think this was probably the thinking at that time and

why such points did not get into it because this was not part

of the AMIASH plan of operation.

Mr. Baron. For the sake of the accuracy of the records

and the protection of the people who were involved at the CIA,

wouldn't even

the tender of such

a device to AMLASHl for whatever

purporses normally be put into the records?

ALASHI Case Officer. Not in a contact report because in

a contact report this goes into the regular file. Whether

Fitzgerald would have made a note of this some place else I

don't know, but in the regular contact report which goes into

the regular file -- in other words, say the secretary would

know about it and this could have been the other part of it.

In other words, to reduce the number of people, to contais

the number of people.

Mr. Baron. Do you recall anything in your discussions

with Fitzgerald that led you to believe that one of the

factors that was in his mind in assessing the sensitivity of

this tender of a poison pen device was

the day on which it

happened as opposed to aimply, the factithat such a device was

offered?

AMIASH Case Officer. It it was in his mind, he never

stated it to me. I think lt was just the overall sensitivity

that the Agency had been, has now, and always has had on

assassinations.

I mean it's not the specific of what had happened that

time. Assassinations were not part of the routine business of

the Agency.

Mr. Johnston. Let me ask you, you have mentioned the

secretary who prepared it. Do you recall the name of the

secretary who prepared this document?

AMLASII Case Officer. No, I don't.

Mr. Johnston. Did you have a regular secretary?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes.

Mr. Johnston. What was her name?

MILASH Case Officer. She could have prepared it or

it could have been Pitzgerald's secretary because, again, of

the days, the sunday.

I don't recall the name.

Mr. Johnston.

You don't recall your secretary's navi?

AMIASI Case Officer. Well, I don't remember if a gir: :

the name of Bohbie Hernandez was still wich me. She was

my secretary during part of that time. She was probably int

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, that's right.

Mr. Johnston. Does that refresh your recollection about

whether or not you gave him the speech?

AMLASI Case Officer. No, because at that time it

could have already been printed in the Paris newspaper and

he could very well have read it in one of the Parisian newspapirs.

Mr. Johnston. MI point out that in that speech, do you

have a recollection of thie being the part of the speach or

you discussed this aspect of the, speech?

AMLASH Case Officer. He did not discuss the speech

paragraph by paragraph. All we did was a very small passing

remark

. ':" about the speech.

Ile haù probably to the best of my recollection already

read it in one of the Parisian newspapers, or 1f I had a news-

paper clipping of the speech, he glanced at it while we were

there, but I don't recall that. But he was certainly satisfied

with the tone of the speech.

ilI. Johnston. You nust have read the speech before

you mentioned it to him. Is this the portion that you had in

mind that would satisfy him about the tone of the speech?

AMIASI! Case Officer. Certainly this sets the tone

for

the whole speech. The extracts that you have made here sets

the tone for the full speech and specifically the one in which

once the harrier is removed, we will be ready and anxious

to work with the cuban people in pursuit of those progressive

goals which in a few short years stirred the

hopes and the

sympathy of many people throughout the entire hemisphere.

MI. Johnston.

was it your intent by making reference to

the speech in your meeting with MiLASll to show that higher

authority was behind what you were doing?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, precisely.

Mr. Johnston. And you felt that this speech colncided

with what you were telling AlliSil?

AMIASH Case Officer. Yes, that the U.S. Government was

prepared, the asgurances at first that Gerald had given him

and I had been giving him that the U.s. Government was willing

to support the cuban people.

Mr. Baron. In the excerpt from the speech that we have

just shown you it says:

"It is important to restate what now divides Cuba fron

my country and from

all the American countries. It is the

fact that a small band of conspirators has stripped the cuban

people of their freedom and handed over the independence ard

soverignty of the cuban

nation to forces heyond the hemispherc.

Then it continues:

"This and this alone divides us.

As long as this is true, nothing is possible. Without it,

everything is possiile.

Once this barrier is removed, we will

be ready and anxious to work with the Cuban people."

That's the end of the quote.

Is it your understanding that this reference to

small

band of conspirators is a reference to the Castro government?

AMI.ASIl Case Officer. Precisely.

Mr. Baron. And in your report of lovenber 19th, or your

memorandum for the record of November 19th, you had mentioneu

that - well, I will simply quote from the report. It says:

The general objective, I never had any doubts in:my mind that

the general objective of organizing a coup against Castro dia

not have the highest governmental approval. I mean this was

never a question, I don't think, in my mind. Again, not

specifically assassination because what I mentioned before,

I don't think fitzgerald or llelms or anybody olse would

specifically have briefed anybody that the MLASH operation was

an assassination plot because it wasn't.

Mr. Baron. So you had no basis for belleving that the

President was informed that a component of the AMLASil operation

was assassination?

AMLASH Case Officer. No, I have no reason. I don't

know. Nobody told me that he had or he hadn't.

MI. Baron. Did fitzgerald make it clear to you that

in providing input to this speech he had the specific purpose

in mind of giving a public signal to AMInsii that he would receivi

support from the highest quarters of the U.s. Government if lie

would move for a coup?

AMLASIl Case Officer. Yes, this was my understanding.

MI. Baron. That the speech was to be a specific signal

to opponents of Castro inside Cuba as opposed to a general

statement of j.s. policy?

of the time and what we were trying to do.

In other words, we were trying to organize a coup and

the problems that we had been through specifically with AMLAS!!

in trying to persuade him that the U.S. government was serious

about supporting Cubans who vere opposed to Castro.

So this statement that appeared in the speech was

certainly public notice that this was the case.

Mr. Baron. Did Fitzgerald or anyone else say anything

to you that led you to belleve that the President had been

specifically informed that representations would be made such

as the ones on Octoher 29th that Robert Kennedy or other high

American officials would stand behind AMLASHI?

MILASH Case Officer. No, he didn't specifically tell me.!

Mr. Baron. Did your conversations with Fitzgerald about

this spoech, his input to this speech, lead you to believe that

the President had been specifically informed that a poison

pen device was

being prepared to be tendered on November 22nd?

No.

Mr. Johnston. Let me ask you in a different context

now, was there a decision after the assassination to break off

further contacts with AILASH?

It wasn't an automatic decision right after the assassination.

In fact, as you recall from my previous testimony we hau

contact with AMLASIl again in late '64 when ho came out. I

think the only hesitancy at that time was what's the new policy?

Does the new President want to continue to, in our attempts

to organize a plot against Castro, a coup against Castro --

That probably was the hesitancy, not the fact that It

was immediately decided to stop contact, which, as I said before,

It wasn't, because we saw him again.

Mr. Johnston. Was there a discussion at all in November

or December 1963 ahout the relationship between the AMLASH

force trying to put together by this time, 29 March, what had

happened. The other document since it's, it's probably a later

date, the yellow document was somebody probably again trying to

reconstruct what had happened. The facts are not as I knew

them at the time.

Both paragraphs have condensed an evolution that took

place over a period of a year and the decision probably was not

made until '65 after I had left the operation, that we were

pulling out.

But the facts as stated here in those two documents are

incorrect, and certainly the timing that they insinuate is

wrong.

MI. Johnston. I think we should develop that on the

record and if you want to point out what facts are incorrect,

Why don't you do so?

AMLASH Case Officer. "The situation changed when Mr.

Sanchez and Mr. Fitzgerald left the meeting to discover that

President Kennedy had been assassinated." That's incorrect.

Fitzgerald wasn't with me on the 22nd of November meeting.

MI. Johnston. Okay. What about the sentence before

that, that Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Sanchez assured subject that

this Agency would give him everything he needed, with your

qualifier that Fitzgerald was not at the meeting?

AMLASH Case Officer, This was at the meeting in october

and not at the November meeting because that is correct,

provided you put it in the right context.

Mr. Johnston. What about the statement, all the money

he wanted?

AMLASH Case Officer. Inferred. I mean I don't recall

that money was ever discussed with this man at any time. In

fact I was asked this question before and I couldn't really

recollect: when I had given him some moncy.

It turns out that the record shows that I did give hin

$350 for his expenses. But money, specifically, again, that

is somebody else interpreting. I don't know of any other

document or certainly any memorandum for the record that I

prepared in which money specifically was mentioned.

Mr. Johnston. But would you disagree with the statement?

AMLASI! Case Officer. Well, the statement as a whole,

if you leave out the money, which again, anything that he needs.

MI. Johnston. Well, that's what we want to leave in.

the money.

MMASI! Case Officer. If he needs the money, I think it

was

not excluded in the offer. But what I'm

saying --

Mr. Johnston. This makes a positive statement, him

saying that you and Mr. Fitzgerald assured ALASH that the

Agency would give him everything he needed, all the money he

wanted.

was made of money because he never asked for money and we

specifically didn't have to respond to telling him that we

would give him money. In telling him that the support necessary!.

all of the support necessary for a coup, I think it 1s implied

that he would get whatever he needed, which would mean supplies.!

but not specifically money, and the reason I state this is that

money was never a subject of contention between the Agency and

AMIASil. lie never asked for money, he never was offéred

specifically money.

MI. Johnston. Mas he assured that he would get all the

money he wanted?

AMLASH Case Officer. All the support he needed, not

the money that he wanted. le never asked for money.

MI. Johnston.

I'm not asking you what he asked for.

I'm asting you what you told him. In this thing it saye

you assured him that you would give him all the money that he

wanted.

Did you give that assurance to him?

AMLASH Case Officer. I did not because I did not

write this document. And the person who wrote this document

that I know of didn't write it fron any factual report at any

time.

no answer. In October or November, 1963, did you

Fitzgerald, to your knowledge, assure AMINSil that he would

receive all the money he wanted?

A'LASH Case Officer. No, and I must qualify that. Unless

he would also receive money. But money specifically, all he

wanted, was never a part of the conversations, to the best of

my knowledge.

Mr. Johnston. We have talked about the next sentence

and

it continues.

"Because of this fact plans of subject changed and it was

decided the Agency could have no part in the assassination of

& government leader, Including Castro. "

Is that accurate?

I'm siving you an opportunity to

rebut the document.

convinced than before that the anly way a coup could be launched

in Cuba was the alimination of Castro and when ha expressed this

conviction, not in '63 but in late '64, 1s when the Agency, and

I presume the U.S. Government at that, tine felt we can't

continue that directly involved with AMLAsil.

MI. Johnston. And the last sentence of that:

"Ihis included the following -- 'We would not furnish

the silencer, nor scope, nor any money for direct assassination.

Furthermore, we would not lift a finger to help the subject

escape from Cuha should he assassinate Castro.'"

Was that the substance of the discussion immediately

after the assassination of President Kennedy?

AMIASH Case Officer. No. A year later in November of

'64.

MI. Johnston. And you're saying that this does not

describe the fall AMLASH meeting?

AMIASK Case Officer.

It does not. It is a mixture of

what happened over at least a two year period.

MIr. Johnston. It perplexes me somewhat that your

failure to cep wiitten records would so warp later thinkers

as to what was going on. I mean take the March, 1965 document.

As of March, 1965 CIA is going on the assumption that you

and Fitzgerald net MiLASHl in Paris, that you assured him that

he would get all the money he wanted

and that your plans

changed after the meeting because of the Kennedy assassination.

AMiSH Case Officer, I can't alt here and presume to

give you an explanation for that as to where the person who

prepared that particular memorandum got that information. The

file Itself indicates, as you are hell awnre, that Iltzgerald

did not travel to Paris in November. lle travelled in October.

So the person who prepared the 29 March, 1965 memo came

up with this particular type of information, I don't know.

Mr. Johnston.

Who is that memo addressed to again?

AMIASII Case Officer. This is to Chief, PI from Chlef,

Reports.

Mr. Johnston. So your only explanation, your explanation

for the memo is that it is Inaccurate but even if it is

inaccurate, it indicates that in March, 1965 these people had

it all wrong as to what the AMLASHl operation was all about.

AMIASH Case Officer. If you want to interpret exactly

what they wrote here, yes, it was wrong. Now I'm not saying

that it was wrong because it could have been. I don't know.

I'm just saying it could have been that they didn't have access

to all the restricted files because this operation until it

received its recent publicity was rept on a very restricted

basis.

So the Chief of Reports, I don't even know, well,

probably the Chief of

Reports in the division or maybe some

place, probably did not have access to all of the operational

files.

MI, Grelssing:

You're saying that the information itself

1s inaccurato only in a chronological way, that it 1s developed?

AMIASI! Case Officer. Certainly wrong in its chronological

context, definitaly because it throws everything into one

very small period of time. In reporting of trying to report

what took place over a much longer period of time.

Mr. Greissing. But the facts that are there over a

period of a year would be true?

AMLASH Case Officer. But not in this context:

MI. Greissing. But I'm saying over the period of a

year from 1 November to the following Novenher when you actually

informed AMIASHl of the feelings that the Agency had developed

at that time, I belleve it is the next sentence down.

AlIASIl Case Officer. What is wrong here, what is wrong

is that after we left that meeting, which I presume they left

the meeting, I presume they're talking about, yes, the 22

November, '63 meeting - this is absolutely

wrong, that when

we left that meeting to discover that President Kennedy had

heer assassinated, we had told him, you know, that this was

all off.

That is wrong. It was not at that meeting that he

was told that. lle went back after that meeting with the idea

of organizing a coup inside Cuba.

the next paragraph. It says that this information was given

In Paris was complaining about AMLASHl's denigrating the

Did you see that report on November 27th, 1963?

of the information was complaining about AMLASh's denigrating

the revolution, and went on to say that she or he wished he

person were saying, suggesting it is not a friendly source to

AMLASH Case Officer. Well, that suggests -- and again, I

can't give you any definitive explanation for it -- what that

suggests is that she overheard AMLASH talking with somebody

else of like mind, and she didn't like what she heard, I guess.

Mr. Johnston. Let's go now to again what you talked about,

any link in your mind or in Fitzgerald's mind in November and

December 1963 between what you had been doing with AMLASH and

the assassination of President Kennedy?

AMLASH Case Officer. None whatsoever, none. whatsoever,

back in time, if you can place yourself back in 1963 and not

1976, after all of this has taken place, after we have had

all the public theories expressed of the connections, all built

on circumstantial evidence of what and who were involved in

the Kennedy Assassination. I take you back and try to place

yourself back within the context of this operation in 1963

when this happened.

be no reason why we would be connecting Kennedy's assassination

with this assassination plot. This was not an assassination

plot, it was not conceived as an assassination plot. As a coup

against Fidel Castro, yes. The fact that the U.S. Government

was not happy and was supporting people who were opposed to

Castro, this was well known. This' was in the aftermath, '63, of

the Bay of Pigs. So there was really in the context of the

time the fact that this was not an assassination plot conceived

as an assassination: plot, there was really no reason to

connect this one particular operation with the tragedy of

President Kennedy•

MI. Johnston. Okay.

We do know that on the 29th of October Fitzgerald told

AMLASH that Robert Kennedy was behind the plot of behind

AMLASH's proposal, is that correct?

AMIASH Case Officer. What we told him was that the u.s.

Government was prepared to support a coup against Fidel

Castro.

MI. Johnston. And AMLASH had previously told you that

at least one of his plans for a coup would require the assassi-

nation of the Castro Brothers.

AMLASH Case Officer. He had not exactly put it in those

terms, but he certainly felt that the first move would have

to be against the leadership, yes. In other words, we never

talked to him in terms of assassination, and I want this

Mr. Johnston. And he told you before the 29th meeting that

the first step would probably have to be the assassination of

the Castros?.

AMLASH Case Officer. He never told me assassination because

he didn't even like to use the word "assassination."

MI. Johnston. What word did he like to use?

AMLASH Case Officer. The neutralization, the elimination

1f you will, of the leadership.

The first move in any coup attempt, in order for the

other officers to fall in line, would have to be the removal,

the removal of Fidel Castro, because of the loyalties that he

still had personally with some of the officers.

Mr. Johnston. And after he told you that on October

29th, you gave

him an assurance that Robert Kennedy backed his

proposal generally.

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, the U.S. Government and

FItzgerald as the representative of Robert Kennedy, supported

a coup against Castro.

Mr. Johnston. On the very day of the assassination, you

referenced the speechof President Kennedy's talking about

an ouster of the current regime in Cuba.

AMLASH Case Officer. That's right.

Mr. Johnston. Were you aware of the September 7th

statement of Fidel Castro's, threatening the lives of U.s.

leaders, and let no I have a poor xerox copy, but especially

a portion of that statement by Fidel Castro on September 7th

at a party at the Brazilian embassy in Havana, he talked to a

reporter, Daniel Harker of AP and said, among other things,

"we are prepared to fight them and answer in kind. The United

States leaderg-should think that if they are aiding terrorist

plans to eliminate Cuban leaders, they themselves will not be

safe."

I would think.from your description of the AMLASH operation

that AMLASH had a plan to eliminate Cuban leaders, and that

it is very possible --

AMLASH Case Officer. So did averybody else. So did every

other Cuban

exile who was plotting against Castro.

MI. Johnston. But this is in the Brazilian Embassy on

September 7th, and you started - meeting with AMLASH on

September 5th in Brazil, and it may be coincidence, but Castro

does give a warning about United States leaders aiding terrorist

plans to eliminate Cuban leaders, and you were doing that very

thing.

AMLASH Case Officer. There is probably a coincidence

there. I don't recall that I knew of this at that time. I've

certainly heardof it since, but I don't see the point that you

are trying to make, because if Castro is behind or was behind

AMLASH to involve him in the assassination of an American

leader, then

are you proposing that he would also publicly

If he was serious about being involved in something like this,

that he would publicly announce his plan, but I may be wrong.

That's just my opinion.

MI. Johnston. So we have this Castro speech of September

7th, whatever that means, and we have the AMLASH operations

we talked about in November and October, and then almost

at the very moment of the Kennedy assassination we have your

weting with AMLASH and giving him the technical equipment or

the assurances of technical equipment that he had requested at

the October 29th meeting.

You knew on November 24th, certainly November 25th, that

the alleged assassin of President Kennedy was pro-Castro, Lee

Harvey Oswald was pro-Castro.

AMLASH Case Officer. I don't even know that at this

time.

Mr. Johnston. You don't know that at this time?

Mr. Baron. Hasn't that a logicäl deduction from the fact

that he was part of the falr Play for Cuba Committee?

AMLASH Case Officer. It could have been, but I haven't

seen that.

MI: Greissing.

He had come out publicly in interviews

stating that he was for Castro and would defend Castro if the

U.S. took action.

AMLASI Case Officer. Well, probably so, but I never had --

MI. Johnston. And in fact, Oswald had visited Mexico City, and

on November 25th, the very day you wrote your contact report,

the Mexico City chief of station cabled headquarters and reminded

then about the Castro speech threat, and I asgume that our informa-

tion is that Mr. King was handling the activity in Mexico

city•

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes.

MI. Johnston. So on November 25th he was aware of the

threat, reminded of the threat.

I think it is fair to say that Mr. King knew that Oswald

had visited the Cuban embassy in Mexico City. He knew that on

November 25th.

Another CIA document indicates that Chief of Station Wynn

Scott --I don't know whether you knew him -- in Mexico City,

on November 25th read a message to the President of Mexico

in which he said, MI. Scott's memo says there are still some

important questions concerning Oswald and his visit to Mexico

There's no reason for you to have seen the document.

just question, this was just a question that was asked. I

wouldn't report it as fact.

MI. Johnston. No, on November 25th that is a question

being raised.

Knowing now, looking back at Mr. King, we have the Western

Hemisphere Division on November 25th is informed that Castro

has made a threat against U.S. leaders, that, the chief of

station in Mexico City is telling

that there is a possibility that Castro was behind it, •

Oswald was known to be pro-Castro, and on November 22nd, you

in turn were meeting in Paris, giving a high level Cuban

assurances that his coup plot that might include assassination

of Castro was backed by the U.S. and that yet you made no

connection between those, all those events, and there was no

discussion of any connection.

AMLASH Case Officer. No, there was no discussion between

the -- the connection between the assassination of President

Kennedy and the AMLASH operation.

Mr. Johnston. Was there an investigation?

Not to my knowledge. I left the

operation right after that, so I mouldn't know if there was

or wasn't. But the coincidence that you are talking about,

if you are connecting or trying now to imply that there was a

connection between AMLASH and the fact that it was on the 22nd

of November, the same date as President Kennedy's assassination,

they must have had a very terrific system of communication.

Mr. Johnston. Although you had set up the meeting on the

20th of November, is that right?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes, but he didn't know specifically

what we were going to say. In fact, the answer that we could

have given him could have been reversed.

MI. Johnston. Weli, you said he requested it.

AMLASH Case Officer. Well, he requested it before he left,

but the assurances, you can go back before that. You can go back

to the October meeting when the assurances of support were given

to him.

So I can't -- I find it very difficult to follow what you

are trying to imply or to relate AMLASH directly to the

assassination on 22 November. This is what I find difficult to

understand.

MI. Johnston. Let me show you a copy of a cable, no

indication that the cable went to SAS. The cable is Mexico

City, 7045, dated 24 November '63 and by way of background,

tell you that immediately upon the assassination, the personnel

In Moxico CIty then started putting the entire sovlet apparatus

in Mexico City under surveillance and pulling the records, and I

don't want to read this into the record because it uses a

true name.

Lot's go off the record.

(Discussion off the record.)

MI. Johnston. Let me read it, except for the true name.

It says "Provided below sufficiently definitive summary

of local contacts of Ivan Gavrilovich Alferlev." It gives his

contacts, it says".

23 December 1961 with the Third Secratary of

Cuban Cultural Attache, naming her, and arranging a press

conference for AMLASHl. It's a very tangential relationship

with the AMLASH operation, but again, on November 24th, 1963,

Mexico City 18 reporting KGB ..or ... Alferiev's contacts, and

it Includes a contact in '61 with AMLASH.

so I have difficulty believing that they are, in hindsight,

not related, and that on November 24th or November 25th no

one at CIA related the two events.

AMLASH Case Officer. What I'm telling you is -- I'm not

telling you that no one at CIA relates the two events. You

asked me the specific question, did you and Fitzgeraldidiscuss

any relationship. My answer to you was that Fitzgerald and I

did not specifically discuss that.

MI. Johnston. Do you know of anyone who discussed it?

Mr. Johnston. Let me now talk - and again the groundwork

is that you were unaware of any investigation of a connection

between the two, and you were unaware of any discussion about

a connection between AMLASH and Kennedy's assassination.

Is that a correct summary?

AMLASH Case Officer. That's correct.

Mr. Johnston. I will show you a document. For the record,

this is a document appearing in Volume IV of the AMLASH

file, and the first page of 1t has AMASH's name on it, but

I call your attention to the red handwriting in the upper right

hand corner of that, on that cover sheet, and it says, "not to

leave this office, per" blank's "orders."

Is that correct?

This document has handwriting in the upper writing hand

corner that it is not to leave this office, whatever that is.

AMLASH Case Officer. Without specific clearance, without

orders.

Mr. Johnston. Do you have any recollection of such orders

being given by any one, yourself, or MI. Fitzgerald?

that Mr. Fitzgerald gave orders to minimize the knowledgeability

that this instzuction

anything else would have been thought of at that time.

MI. Johnston. What suddenly required that order to be

given?

AMLASH Case Officer. Well, nothing specific except that

by December of '63, the man with whom we were dealing, AMLASH I,

was going back, or was probably back by that time already in

Cuba. It was primarily probably I would say as much to protect

his security as anything else.

MI. Johnston. So that nobody else - did this have the

effect of blocking knowledge of the AMLASH operation from other

people within the Agency?

AMLASH Case Officer. Probably from my office down. Certainly

not Fitzgerald, not the Director or not anybody else who needed

to know about the operation, absolutely not. This was just

circulation within other components of SAS. That would not --

in other words, a note of this type would only mean that I

I don't even recall giving -- telling the secretary this

particular thing. It probably came about from the miminized

circulation order that fitzgerald had given may before in

October, as I recall.

MI. Johnston. Did you expect this instruction to be carried

out, that the file would not leave the office until you had

given your personal approval or Fitzgerald had approved it?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes. I would have thought that my

secretary would not have permitted this file to leave unless

cleared.

Mr. Johnston. We previously discussed whether Mr. King

knew about the operation.

Did he specifically know, to your knowledge, about the

AMLASH operation in the fall of 1963?

AMLASH Case Officer. I don't know. I never briefed him

personally.

MI: Johnston. Did you have any reason to know that he

did know about AMLASH speration?

MILASH Case Officer. No.

Mr. Johnston. Our noies indicate that on february sth,

1964, Mr. King sent a memo to you requirements for AMLASH, and

I'll show you our notes. They basically detail questions,

intelligence information to be gathered from AMLASH.

AMLASH Case Officer. I don't specifically remember receiving

this, but if we have - certainly the fact that we have an

asset who can surface any intelligence requirements

from the

community of anybody else in the Agency, it would be perfectly

normal for anybody to send these requirements:

Mr. Johnston. Would you agree, at least. from that summary

of the document, that really he's asking you to get intelligence

type information from AMLASH?

Is that correct?

AMLASH Case Officer. Yes.

MI. Johnston. And given the October 5th, 1963 meeting when

AMIASHl sort of indicated he didn't want anything to do with

that, this would be very inconsistent for someone who was

knowledable about AMLASH.

AMLASH Case Officer. What are the dates?

Mr. Johnston.

October 5th, 1963, is when AMLASH complained

about the low level espionage requirements.

AMLASH Case Officer. He did not want -- he did not say

that he would not surface intelligence requirements. He did

not want to exclusively be that type of an asset.

So therefore it would be perfectly normal, regardless of

what he thought himself to be, or what even we may have thought

for him to be, that if he had

access to information, we were

going to levy the requirements on him.

Mr. Johnston. My direct question is, then, having read

the summary apparently prepared by MI. King, and sent on

February Ind, 1964, do you think that Mr. King knew about the

AMLASH operation, the events of October and November?

AMLASH Case Officer. If he sent us a memo giving us

requirements for AMLASH, at a minimum he had to know that we had

an agent with this particular access. But he knew about the

operation? Not necessarily so.

Mr. Johnston. Do you find this consistent with the

nature of the operation as of November 22nd, 1963?

AMLASH Case Officer. Explain that. I don't understand.

What are you - what is your question?

MI. Johnston. As of November 22nd, 1963, you were now

Involved in coup plotting with AMLASH, and were delivering of

planned to deliver the equipment, rifles, sights, explosives.

to assist him in that coup. It seems inconsistent, suddenly in

February, to go back to trying to get espionage information

from him.

AMLASH Case Officer. First of all, I have to address

that question from this point. Receiving a memo from king at

that time doesn't necessarily mean that we are going to levy

the reguirements on AMLASil.

Mr. Johnston. Oh, I agree with that.

AMLASH Case Officer. So, to clarify the other part of your

question, that if we needed intelligence after the October

'63 meeting in which he said I'm not going to be strictly a

source for intelligence, I want to do something more for my

country, it would not be in any way out of the orderinary to

ask him to send information that we felt was. required on the

outside.

Mr. Johnston. So you are saying you would not infer from

this document's conclusion one way or the other about whether

MI. King knew the details of the AMLASH coup plotting.

AMLASH Case Officer. No.

MI. Johnston. As a final matter from my point, as we did

In your past meetings, could you briefly summarize, were you

contacted prior to today's session at the Agency, and did you

discuss your testimony or the ramifications of your testimony

with anyone at the Agency?

AMIASH Case Officer. I was called yesterday morning,

February 10th, by Mr. Walter Elder, and informed that I was

to come here at 10:00 o'clock to discuss the AMLASH operation,

and that you would be over yesterday afternoon to mark those

portions of the file that you wished to discuss.

I picked up the files from the review staff last night

came hore this morning.

MI. Johnston. Did you discuss the substance of proposed

substance of your testimony with anyone?

AMLASH! Case Officer. No. I read the file and informed

myself as to those points that you wanted to talk about.

Mr. Johnston. That's all the questions we have.

I want to thank you very much for spending the time with

us

today.

Is there any other comment you would like to make?

AMLASH Case Officer. No, not at all.

An Extract From Kennedy's Address to Press

Washington Post,

Tuesday,

November 19, 1963, P. AlS

(AP) Nov. 18 -- The following is a text of President Kennedy's address

tonight before the Inter-American Press Association:

"The genuine Cuban revolution

-- because it was against the tyran-

ny and corruption

of the past

-- had the support of many whose aims and

concepts were noble.

"But that hope for freedom and progress was destroyed.

"The goals proclaimed in the Sierra Maestra were betrayed in Havana.

"It is important to restate what now divides Cuba from my

all the American

countries: It is the fact that a small band

of conspirators has

stripped the Cuban people of their

ed over the independence and sovereignty of the Cuban nation to forces

They have made Cuba a victim of foreign imperial-

a weapon in an effort dic-

and this alone divides us.

As long as this is true nothing is possible.

Without it everything is possible.

Ready and Anxious

"Once this barrier is removed we will be ready and anxious to work

with the Cuban people in pursuit of those progressive goals which,

short years ago,

stirred their hopes and the sympathy of many people

throughout the entire hemisphere.

"No Cuban need feel trapped between dependence on the broken prom-

ises of foreign conunism and the hostility of the rest of the hemisphere.

For once Cuban sovereignty has been restored we will extend the hand of

friendship and assistance to a Cuba whose

political and economic insti-

tutions have been shaped by the will of the Cuban people."
