Red, Assassination of the President

I told Ford in strict confidence that the Director concurred with his

viewpoint. I mentioned that our investigation thus far had conclusively shown that

Oswald operated by himself and that Ruby additionally was a loner. However, FEI

investigation was still pending on a large number of rumors, speculation and gossip

and it, therefore vould be quite unfair for the Commission to take a stand prior to

li the evidence being turned in.. Ford stated this was his point entirely and that

although he was a minority of one he intencied to stick to his point.

Ford told me that John McCone, Director of CIA, had, approximately

one weck ago, gone up to his office and told him that ClA had uncovered some

"startling information" in the Oswald case. McCone proceeded to tell Ford that a

source oi Cla's in Mexico had seen money exchange hands between Oswald and an

unknown Cuban Negro. Ford stated this excited him greaily inasmuch as it definitely

Conspiracy theories are lashionable.

sometimes even fruitful, as in the

case of Watergate. So it is not surprising

that recent revelations of the Senate In-

telligence Committee have resurrected

an old question: what connection, it any,

did the Castro government have with the

assassination of John F. Kennedy?

Current speculation is that the Cuban

dictator.

having learned of CIA plots

against his life, decided to strike back,

returning violence for violence, with

consequences that are now history. In-

deed, the recent report of the Schweiker-

Hurt task force, while finding no hard

evidence to support this theory, did un-

cover some interesting new leads. More

than that, it established that a CIA-FBI

"cover-up" had deprived the Warren

commission of vital information that pre-

vented it from seriously exploring the

possibility of Castro's involvement and

that consequeritry there is no longer any

reason to have faith in its picture of the

Kennedy assassination.

And so we may well have a reopening

of the ingestigation. At last.

Given all this, it seems appropriate to

examine the record of the period. A small

but interesting body of published testi-

mony and reminiscences describes and

imply documents a little-known cam-

paign of accommodation launched by

Washington and Havana in the weeks

preceding that fateful day in November

1963. Actually, the origins of this tenta-

tive and ultimately ill-fated rapproche-

mut may be traced to the previous

results. At that time, William Attwood, an

PART THO: JIM BRADEN

One of the most incrodible bodies of recent information

concerning the alleged conspiracy to assassinate President

Kennedy is largely based on the investigative research

done by Peter doyes, a former CBS Producer and

top inves-

tigative reporter.

Last year, Noyes published a book, Legacy of Doubt, which

summed up

many of his findings, and which generally outlines

what Noyes believes was heavy

Mafia involvement in the

assassination. The Noyes book is almost entirely factual

is largely based on substantiated information such as

police records provided by the FBI, the Los Angeles Police

Department, the California Attorney General's Office, and

Texas police officials.

Though the hoyes book (like most recent assassination books)

did not sell well or receive much

press attention, it has

been regarded as a valuable contribution by most of author

Noyes'

fellow Warren Commission critics.

It can definitely be said that almost all of Moyes' findings,

particularly with respect to his main character Jim Braden,

nave been factually substantiated and are solidly establishec

by official police records.

Basically the Noyes book outlines the background of a

mysterious man who was picked up by the police at the scene

of President Kennedy's assassination just minutes after the

shooting. The man was apprehended by a Dallas policeman who

thought he was behaving suspiciously. The man, who identified

himself under the false name of Jim Braden,

was released

shortly thereafter following brief questioning by the Dallas

Sheriff's Office.

Author Noyes uncovered the story of Jim Braden and his

true identity during five years of investigative research.

And it is Jim Braden's true identity and his ironic misfortune

of being picked up at the scene of the assassination for

"looking suspicious" that the warren Commission critics now

believe ranks with James McCord's mistake of leaving masking

tape on

the doors during the Watergate break-in as the ultimate

fatal slip-ups

in the two conspiracies.

For Jin Braden, those true identity is Eugene Hale Brading,

is a man with

singularly avesome direct ties to the highest

levels of the

Mafia. Of all the Mafia figures connected

the syndicate's crucial security and enforcement activities

of coercion, maiming, intra-syndicate assassination and

outside murder contracting,

Jim Braden appears to be an

indispensable link - or leader - of organized crime's

far flung network of "controlled violence" specialists

and professional hit men.

Braden's involvement with the Mafia's highest echelon

"enforcers" has spanned the continent from coast to coast

and covers virtually every national crime syndicate juris-

diction: According

Justice Department's organized crine strike force units, and

The importance of this mysterious man who was picked up

under a false name across

the street from the Texas Book

Jan Bracion's direst On lovember 22

Deputy C.L. Lewis was one of the first Dallas police

officers on the scene at the Texas School Book Depository

following the assassination.

within just minutes after the deadly shots were fired,

Deputy Lowis confronted a man across the street from the

Book Depository, a man whom Lewis thought was "acting

suspiciously."

Deputy Loris questioned the man for several minutes before

taking him to the Sheriff's office for further interrogation.

The man identified hinself

as Jim Braden, and said that he

was in the oil business in Beverly Hills, California. Deputy

Lewis became even more suspicious. over the way the man first

tried to identify himsolf. Instead of producing his driver's

license, the common means of identification, the man pulled

out a gasoline credit card instead.

The man who identified himself as Jim Braden strongly protested

when Deputy Lawis told him that he would have to take him in

for further interrogation.

it the Sheriff's office, Jim Braden agreed to make a voluntary

statement. Braden, then 48, told the police that he was in

Dallas on oil business and

said

had been there for two days. He

he was staying at the cabana liotel, s short distance away

the scene of the assassination. Braden said he had been

walking down the strcet by the Texas Bool Depository at the

time of the assassination and had been looking for a taxi cab.

Jim Braden further

stated that he was confronted by Deputy

Lewis inside a building across the street from the depository.

during an attempt to make a telephone call following the

shooting.

Braden was shortly thereafter released by the Dallas Sheriff's

office.

Braden

was not fingerprinted, nor was any check made

of possible criminal records relating to hin.

Two nonths later, in late January of 1964, Jim Braden was

interviewed by tro

FBI agents

at his office in Beverly Mills.

The warren Commission's investigation was then in full swing

and witnesses to the

assassination vere being questioned by

the IBI and other authorities. In his FBI interview, Braden

gave the same account as he had given to the dallas police on

the day of the assassination. The FBI's official report on

Braden's interrogation further stated, that,

"Braden has no

information concerning the assassination and both Lee Harvey

Oswald and Jack Ruby are unknown to him."

Jim Braden's True Identity Energes

In early 1909, Peter loves, the investigative reporter

whose book: covers much of

the information regarding Jim

Braden, began investigating the mysterious California

"oil man."

joyos originally received a tip about Braden from a

former FBI agent who was then aiding District Attorney

Jim Garrison's investigation of the Kennedy assassination.

The FBI man told loves of Braden's presence at the scene of

the assassination at the time of the shooting.

loyes soon found that Jim Braden was no longer at cither

of the addresses that he had given the dallas police, and

had left no forwarding addresses.

loyes then had the California Department of Motor Vehicles

run a chock on the license number that Braden had given to

the Dallas police at the Sheriff's office following the

assassination.

Hotor Vehicles told Moyes that Braden's

(11751755) had been renewed by Braden in San Diego

county in lovember of 1906. Braden has also listed new

business and home addresses, which interestingly were over

a hunarca miles apart.

The Department of l'otor Voiclos' records on Jin Braden

also showed that "Jim Braden" was not really his original

name. The license had actually been issued in the 1950's

to Eugone lalc Erading, which is Braden's true identity.

On Sentenber 10, 1903, just ten wechs before the assassination,

Bugene Hale Brading had notified the Department that he had

Icgally changed his name to Jim Braden, and he roquested a

new license under that name. The license was granted.

Intrigued by the fact that Jin Braden vas really a false

identity assumed by Eugene Brading, investigator Noves

contacted the Intclligence Division of the California

Attorney General's

office, and had a chech run on the

mysterious Brading.

Hoyes was told. that Eugene Hale Brading "is a real bad guy.

H'e's got a long rap sheet and apparantly has liafia connections."

Nojes shortly thercafter obtained a copy of Eugene Brading's

(Jim Braden's) police records.

•HH 54923 DocId:32423629 Page 24

The Brading "rap sheet" contained an incredible 35

soperate entrles covering virtually every phase of

crininal activity, including mall fraud, embezzlement,

operating a ganbling house in diani, car theft,

shop

lifting, receiving stolen property, and solling wartime

gas ration coupons

on the black market.

lost of these arrests had been made under the name of

sugonc Hale Brading, but the police dossier on him

also

showed a handful of other aliases,

including Harry eugene

Bradley,

Gone Brady, James Lee Cole, James Bradley Lee,

and invitably, Jim

Braden.

"Jin Braden" was the last entry shown on Brading's

records.

Incredibl:, investigator lloyes found that due to the fact

that the Dallas police had not fingerprinted Jim Braden or

run a male on him, his true identity of sugene trading las

never discovered by the FBI

or the warren Commission at the

time of their investigation of the assassination. The warren

Commission had only routinely included Braden's short state-

ment about being

in Dallas on

"oil business" in a police

exhibit on witnesses contained in Warren Commission Hearing's

Volune XIX. Jim Braden and his story had been accepted at

faco value.

Braden based upon all available police records and

What soon clearly emerged as a long record of involvement

' by Braden (Bradina) viti

many of the most notorious haria.

Icadcis in the nation, a record of close association with

Key

figures in the national crime syndicate.

Folloving a string of arrests in the 1910's, dating all

the way back to his young adulthood, sugene

Brading had

moved to El Paso, Texas,

in 1950.

(BRADING AND PEREIRA)

In El Paso, Brading became closely associated with Victor

Pereira, a

man who was a close associate and confidante of

scveral

Mafia

menbers. Brading and Pereira becane irvolved

in a number of schemes involving marriage to and embezzlement

of wealthy widows.

In 1951,

Brading and his close friend Porcira wore arrested

by the rD! in New York on a

fugitive varrant issued in Texas.

The two mon

were charged with embezzling over $50,000 from

a wealthy widow whom Percira had marrica shortly beforc

flocing with her moncy. Brading and Percira vere

soon con-

victed of the charges

and wore each sontenced to 12 years

in prison.

llow:eve:,

Brading and Icreira were out free during the three

ycars of their appeals,

and Brading was later paroled in 1959

after having served just five years of his sentence.

(BRADING AND THE

SMALDOIES)

During the three vears of frcedom under their appeals of the

convictions,

Brading and Percira left Texas (folloving still

another floccing of another wealthy widow and moved to

Denver, Colorado.

In Denver, Brading became vory closely associated vith

two leading lafia bosses in the Rocky Mountain area, Clyde

and Gene Smaldone.

syndicate's vending-machine market which stretched from

the Rockies all the way to Chicago. Police records show

that at one time, the Smaldones virtually controlled the

entire lueblo arca of Colorado.

The smaldone brothers wore notorious for the brutal brand

of violence they practiced in their opcrations. Brading

(Draden) becane involved in many transactions with the

Smaldones and became a close personal friend. Several years

Later, after brading inally went to jail for the embezzlement

of the Icxas wirow, the smaldone brothers reqularly wrote

to him in prison, secking his advice on various financial

matters.

(BRADING AND CLARK AND BAUMAIT)

Brading and his friend Pereira later moved

to Beverly Hills

In calliornia. shortlY thercaiter, Brading Inevitably came

under investination by the los Angeles lolice Department

Intolligence Division's lafia specialists.

In particular, the LAPD interest in Brading was focused on

his close association in Beverly Hills with tro

"oil specu-.

lators" from !liami, Arthur Clark and Roger Baunan. Clark

and Bauman

were notorious Maria figures with lona police

records.

Brading's friend Clark had been one of the ton leaders of

he famous purple Gang of the bafia, which had oncratec

ut of Detroit and Younastown. The Los Anacles nolice hac

nlaced Clark and Bauman under tight surveillance and had

compiled extensive information on their friendship with

Brading•

In 1956, the Chief of intelligence of the InPD, captain

James fianilion,

sent a letter to the Crime Commission of

Greater liiami

seeking infornation about Clarl, Bauman, and

Brading.

Captain Hamilton, who was known as one of the foremost

experts on the infia in the nation, asted the Miami Commission

Which was conducting ostensive investigations o's the Mafial

to inform him as to the involvement of several associates of

Clark and Baunan.

Among those named was Eugene

Brading.

HH 54923

Captain Hamilton's lotter stated:

"This Department has under investigation Arthur

These men arc representing thomselves as officials

"Clark has been arrested several times and has been

associated with many confidence men and hoodlums such

Victor Percira,

jugene Brading,

brothers of Denver."

As investigator Peter loves points out, the men listed

with Brading in the letter, represent a virtual "who's imo"

of organized crime leaders

between California and the Midwest.

(BRADING AND PRATIANO)

Of these top lafia men listed with Brading (Braden) perhaps

the most important one is James Fratianno, also widely known

as "Jimmie The Weasel." Fratianno was known as perhaps the

Mafia's highest ranking executioner in the nation.

In 1959, in his testimony before the Rackets Conmittee of

the California logislature, Captain Hamilton, the chiet of

LAPD Intelligence, stated that,

"ie have long considered Fratianno to

he the

exccutioner for the lafia on

the Hest Coast."

Captain Hamilton told the Rackets Committee that his Intelligence

Division had linked Jinnie Frationno to at least sixteen Mafia

executions.

Fratianno had once been arrested for the attempted assassination

of Los Angeles

Mafia head Mickey Cohen in 1949. Conen had

survived the bloody shooting wich took the lifo

nis licutenants. Fratianno was later releasca duc to insuf-

ficient ovidence. Fratianno used the alini that he had been

at the home of liafia associate Nick Licata the night of the

shooting. Licata later became the new head of the Los Angeles

Mafia,

and, perhaps significantly, was later aven control oI

the Mafia in Dallas, Texas.

jimmie Iratianno was also suspocted of complicity in

Jim braden: Possible Link To Jack Ruby

Ihe same inadequate investigative work which led the

Warren Commission to largely overlook Jack Ruby's solid

Mafia involvement,

apocars also to have been responsible

for the failure to uncover Jim Braden's true identity of

Eugene Brading during the official investigation into the

Kennedy assassination.

As shown in the provious account of Jack Ruby's very

substantial ties to the Mafia, Ruby vas particularly

involved in the syndicate areas of gambling and narcotics.

But bevond the multiplicity of evidence which indicates

that Jack Ruby and Jim Braden were both important liafia

figures opcrating in the same general arcas, at the

general times,

there is another single niece of evidence

which nlaces both Ruby and Braden at the same place on the

day before the assassination.

Evidence indicates that both Jim Braden and Jack Ruby

visited the Dallas offices of the !l.l. Hunt Oil Company

on the afternooi? of lovember 21, 1963, just twenty four

hours before the President was murdered. Obviously any

link which places both Braden and Ruby in the

same place

at the same time on the day before the assassination does

of course raise further significant questions about a

possible relationship between the tro men.

Jin Braden received parmission fron the U.s. Board of

Parole in los ingeles to male a trip to ballas, Texas on

coverber 1?, 1903, four days before the assassination.

Braden was required to report all of his travels to his

Parole Boaid following his parole in 1959 for the embez-

on November 21, 1903, the day before the assassination,

Jim Braden chocked in with the U.S. Parole Office in

Dallas. According to Roger Carroll

the Chief Parole

Officer

in Dallas, Braden (Brading) "advised that ne

planned to see Lamar liunt and other oil speculators while

here." Lamar Hunt is the son

of f.L. Hunt, the famous

right-ring oil billionaire.

laul nothornel, a former fil agent ho was Director of

security for the liunt oil Connany in Dallas at that tine,

has recalled

that he distinctly renombers Braden visiting

the funt offices on November 21 in the company of three

other men. Rothernel has stated that the office 10g for

lovember 21 showed that Roger Bauman (Brading's old

Hafia

friend and tornan Brown and Duane Howlin "and friend"

visited the llunt office on that afternoon. Rothermel states

that Braden was definitely the "friend."

(security chief Paul Rothormel was later firod by l!.L. Hunt's

sons after reports allcgadly surfaced that Rothernel was

"suspicious" of a possible lunt connection to the assassin-

ation. Folloving his termination by

Sound

that he was being illegally wiretapped.

Rothernel

filed suit agninst Lamar Hunt and another one of w.l. Hunt's

sons, charging them with the virctapring, and asking for

several million dollars in damages. The

suit, which has

produced very damaging evidence against the Hunt brothers,

is still in the courts.)

Also on November 21, the day before the assassination,

accordina to a conclusion of the larren Commission, Jack

Ruly was also on his may to the lot lunt olilces In ballas.

The larren Commission concludod that Jacl Ruby drove a woman

work in Ruby's nightclub

stripper,

drove with Ruby to the

lunt offices,

apparantly

in scarch of emploument. This does coincide with Braden's

visit to the same offices on that same afternoon.

The warren Commiasion investigated soveral other

possible

links of Jack luby to to munts,

includind the still

unernlined fact that Lamar Hunt's name was found insido

one of Ruby's notebooks. But of these possible lints, the

Harren Commission concluded only that evidence diù indicate

that Ruby had criven to the Hunt offices on lovember 21.

Thus a possible ruby-Braden connection on the day before

the President's assassination does indeed arise.

Jim BIncion: iossible link to David Ferric

Investigator Peter Moyes has turned up several pieces

of information which indicate a possible connection botreen

Jim

Braden and the mysterious

David Icrria.

David Farric was the homoscrual airline nilot and private

invostinator thor Jim Garrison accused of participating

in the plot to assassinate

PIcsident kennedy. Six days after

District ittorney Garrison's charges vero nade nublic, David

Ferrice was

found?

dead in his apartment in New Orleans. His

mysterious death was finally ruled to have been a suicide.

David Ferrie has boen a target of investigation ly critics

of the Warren Connission ever since the assassination. In

inct the aBI and Secret Service both investigated a possible

Ferrie role inmodiatoly after the assassination. It was

widely rumored in He: Orloans and Dallas that Forrie vas to

alleged assassins out of the country folloring

the assassination. Ine warren Commission decided not to include

the official secrot sarvice and FBI reports on Forric in

26 volumes of Hearints which vere released after the warren

Leport was

issued. However,

the Justice Denartment did finally

release those ronorts to the National Archives in 1957 following

Garrison's public accusations.

author Noves has siner established that both Jim Braden and

Davod Ferrie worked out of thenfloor of offices in a building

in Now Orleans in the month or two immediately preceding the

assassination.

This is particularly significant due to the faci that

at that

time the mysterious David Forrie was cnploved as a private

investigator by Carlos Marcello, the lon Hafia Kinavin. It

is widely believed by nost federal authorities that Carlos

Marcello rants with his close friend lloyer Lansly as one of

the two single most poverful loadors of the infia's national

international crine syndicate. Carlos inrcello heads the

l'afia ompire conterod in New Orleans, Louisiana, and controls

most of the Mafia activity in the southern part

of the United

States.

In Septenber and October of 1963, just weeks bofore the

assassination, David Ferrie was

working out of the offices

of carlos Marcello's criminal attorney, G. wray Gill. Ferrie,

who was doing investigative work on a

nerjury charge that his

boss larcello was then encing, worked out of loom 1707 in the

Fore liarauctte Building in New Orleans.

At this same time, in september and October of 1963, Jim

way down the hall from David ferrie in room 1707.

Interestintly,

in one visit to his Parole Offico, Braden

"nistalenly" told his Parole Officer that he as worling

out of Room 1706 - which would have heen the room next

door to ferrie - instead of room 1701.

Thus a nossihle Braden-Ferrie connection in the weeks

just bofore the assassination does indeed arise in acdition

to the possiblr Braden-Ruby connection. Both connections

Jim Braden: Author Peter loves And Judae lvIng

material regarding Jim Braden (Bugone Brading),

is a former classmate and close friend of Judge Matthe!

Byrne, JI.

the U.S. District Court Judge who presided

over the Ellsbera

Pentagon Papers trial last year.

As is now well known, Judge Byrne dismissed the case

against Ellsbera after he was notified that the white

Ilouse "Plumbers" had once burglarized the office of

üllsberg's psychiatrist.

A short time later, it became known that fresident Nixon

had twice instructed John thrlichnan to anproach Judge

Byrne during the course of the tllsberg trial and offer him

the rosition of Diroctor of the FBI. This offer, which Judge

Byrne resused, has

been regarded as a potential

bribery by some critics of President Inson, and is currently

under investigation by the soccial Prosecutor's office.

It has boon widely assumed

that lixon's fervent intcrest

in the outcone of the prosecution of allahore may have

been the motivation behind his approach

to Judge Byrne.

Author Moyes has written of his friend Judge Byrne's

involvement in his research on Jim Braden. In 195?

information regarding

tie mysterious Braden, he took the information to hin

Prichd, Matt Byrne, uno was then los. attorney for southern

California. Hoyes had several talks with Byone and has said

that Byrne

was very impressed by the subatantive evidence

which Moves had

gathered. During one of these mectings with

byrne and another FBI man

whom Byrne had invited to attend,

the Fil man told Moves that the FBI had never before linown

that Jin Braden - the man arrested at the scone of the

assassination in 1903 - was actually Bugone erading. The

FBI man said that the Bureau must have made a big mistala

in not tracing down Braden's true identity and police record.

The FBI man was nearly incredulous over loves' evidance on

Braden.

loyes meanwhile had discovered that Jim Braden had also been

in ios angeles on the night that robert Kenncdy was assassinated

in carly June of 1968.

Though loves couldn't find any significant information indicating

any. Braden connection to the secona kennedy murder, he and his

The la Costa Country Club had become, under the direction

in the financing of the project. La Costa became what is

known in the Mafia as "open

The Washington Post

August 22, 1976

Slain Mobster Claimed

Cuban Link to JFK Death

By Ronald Kessler and Laurence Stern

Washington Post Staff Writers

Long before his recent murder,

John Rosselli, the CIA's underworld

recruit in attempts to kill Fidel Cas-

tro, had been privately claiming that

agents of the Cuban premier, in' retali.

' ation, were involved in the assassina-

tion of President John F. Kennedy.

Rosselli's belief in a Cuban connec-

tion to the Kennedy assassination was

expressed through his attorney,

Ed-

ward P. Morgan, to the FBI

as long

ago as March, 1967, and also in private.

, conversations with a longtime associ.

ate of Rosselli who participated in

meetings between Rosselli

and the

CIA.

An FBI "blind memorandum" on

an

interview

with

Morgan

dated

March 21, 1967, was included, without

identification of the

interviewee, in

last June's Senate Intelligence Com-

mittee's report on the role of the in-

telligence community in the Kennedy

assassination investigation.

Morgan told the FBI that Rosselli

and

another Morgan

client had in-

formed him that Castro became aware

of

CIA

assassination

against him and "thereafter employed

teams of individuals who were dis-

patched to the United States for the

purpose of assassinating Mr. Ken•

nedy."

Because neither Morgan nor Ros-

selli was identified in the Senate re-

port, the significance of that portion

of the 106-page

document was dis-

counted at the time it was published :

in June, before Rosselli's disappear:

ance and the subsequent discovery of

his body in

an

oil drum

in

Florida

waters. The Washington Post, however,

has confirmed that Morgan and Rosselli

. were the sources of the testimony that

suggested a Cuban role in the Ken-

nedy murder.

Morgan's account, according: to a •

summary of the FBI interview, was

that Rosselli had reached his conclu-

sion about a Cuban connection to the

Kennedy

assassination

from

«feedback" furnished by sources close

to Castro who were involved in the CIA

plots to assassinate the Cuban leader.

"His (Morgan's) clients were aware

of the identity of some of the individ-

uals who came to the United States

for this purpose and he understood

that two such individuals were now in

the state of New. Jersey," the FBI in

terview summary stated.

A long-time

associate. of Rosselli

who was interviewed separately by

The Washington Post, said there was

no question in the slain mobster's

mind that President Kennedy was

¿ killed on Castro's behalf in reprisal

for the CIA schemes against the Cu-.

ban leader.

"He was positive; he was sure," said

the associate, who knew Rosselli well

and was in contact with him before

• Rosselli disappeared from his Florida

home on July 28. The associate, who

i does not want to be identified pub-

i licly, is scheduled to be interviewed

this week by Dade County, Fla., homi-

cide detectives. He was a party to Ros-

selli's contacts in the early 1960s with

CIA case officers overseeing the at-

tempts to assassinate Castro.

Despite occasional speculation, the

collective conclusion of all

the Kennedy assassination-including

the Warren Commission, the FBI and

the CIA-has been that there was no

evidence that implicated the Castro

However, the CIA's involvement in

, Two months before the Kennedy as-

Lee Harvey Oswald, who

was identified by the Warren Commis-

gain entry to Cuba. According to the

Warren Commission, Oswald

Cuban Revolution.

Some three months before Kennedy

was killed,

Associated

Press reporter Daniel Harker that

eliminate Cuban leaders would them-

A U.S. government committee coor

that Castro would retaliate in some

fashion. However, it concluded Castro

would not risk a major confrontation

with the U.S. by attacking U.S: lead-

On the same day Kennedy was as

sassinated, a CIA officer met with a

high-ranking Cuban official, who had

said he would kill Castro, to tell him

the U.S. would provide him with ex-

plosives and a poison pen device.

The JFK Assassination: Curiosity in Havana

An inquisitive American learns many things on a

visit to Cuba. One of the most surprising is that high

officials in Havana seem genuinely hopeful that the

investigation of the Kennedy assassination will be re-

opened. They are convinced that there was a Cuban

factor in the murder.

•Conversations with senior officials of the Cuban;

government, including Deputy Prime Minister Carlos

Rafael Rodriguez, make clear that they have followed

closely the disclosures by the Senate Intelligence

Committee casting doubt upon the Warren Commis-

sion investigation. The Cubans are well aware that the

doubts center on the failure of the CIA and the FBI to

inform the Warren Commission of the several plots

mounted by the CIA to kill Fidel Castro. Knowledge

of these plots appears to have been withheld even

from the FBI and CIA officials who were responsible

for investigating the President's murder and for sup

porting the work of the Warren Commission. As a re-

sult, there was no special effort to explore the possi-

ble involvement of either the Cuban government or

Cuban exiles in the assassination. Evidence developed

by the Senate committee makes both hypotheses plau.:

sible and a new inquiry imperative.

The situation is murkier and more perplexing than :

ever. Those who are resistant to conspiracy theories.

• and who have been prepared even, eager -to be-

lieve that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone can no:

Jonger rely on the Warren Commission report as an

cign Relations." 7

adequate prop for their predilections. The commis,

sion did not know that on Nov. 22, 1963, at about the

very hour Oswald struck in Dallas, an agent of the

Central Intelligence Agency was meeting with a rank-

ing Cuban official (code-named AMLASH and re.i

cently identified as Rolando Cubela) to plan the mur.:

der of Castro. Simultaneously, in Cuba, a French re.

porter, Jean Daniel, was spending the day with Cas-

tro, conveying to the Cuban leader views expressed"

by President Kennedy in a brief interview at they

White House on Oct. 2%, persuading Castro that Ken.

nedy: wanted to explore ways to normalize relations.

• Thus, at the moment the President was killed, U.S.

policy. toward Cuba appeared to be moving not only

on two tracks but in opposite directions, and move;

ment on either track could have provoked violent re-

sponse by one or another Cuban faction...

Perceptions inside the Cuban government re-

sponded to both tendencies in U.S. policy. There is

good reason to suspect that the AMLASH operation

involved a double agent, or at least a singularly inept

one. Castro almost certainly knew of it. The CLA even-

, tually concluded that the AMLASH activity was "inse-:

cure" and terminated it. Among other discoveries.

within two days of the assassination it was known (but

not to the Warren Commission) that AMLASH had:

been in contact with Soviet personnel in Mexico City,

where Oswald had gone in September 1983 to visit

hoth the Cuban and Soviet consulates. Whether these .

• facts are significant or merely coincidental, one can-

not tell. In retrospect, Cuban authorities note with

some relief that Oswald was denied permission to visit

Cuba, implying that, had his request been granted;

the finger of suspicion would surely have pointed at

Havana.

Perhaps more suggestive of a direct leak from AM•:

. LASH to Castro was the sequence of events on Sept. 7,

1963, when the CIA re-established contact with the Cu-

ban conspirator for the first time since the preceding

year. Late that evening, Prime Minister Castro called

in Associated, Press reporter Daniel Harker för an un.!

expected interview. Only three Western reporters.

were based in Havana at the time and their contact

with Castro was quite limited. Evidently, the Cuban

leader had a message he wished to get on the record

through Harker. He charged that the United States

was aiding terrorist plots in Cuba and warned U.S.

leaders that "if they are aiding terrorist plans to elimi

nate Cuban leaders, they themselves will not be safe."

This threat of reprisals seems less inflammatory

and more understandable now that we know what

Castro knew at the time, namely, that the United

States was in fact stepping up its covert operations

against Cuba during the summer and fall of 1963. Yet

it seems an exception to the main lines of Cuban pol.

icy as it was then evolving.

For months afer the missile crisis of 1962, Castro

had been displeased with the Soviets, and there are

signs that he was interested in an opening to Wash-

ington, On Sept. 5, the. Cubans quietly proposed talks,

with the Americans at the United Nations, and Ken-se

medy soon responded with interest: Also, in early Sep

Aires, Gavin Scott, travelling on a Canadian passport.

spent two weeks in Cuba. Although key U.S. officials

have no recollection of consulting with Scott on that

occasion, the Cubans recall his questions and com-:

ments as hinting of American interest in a possible ace

commodation, much as they were later to interpret

the discussions between Jean Daniel and Castro.

Then and now the Cubans' attitude toward Ken-?

nedy has been a compound of political antipathy andy

personal admiration. While critical of Kennedy's role

in various counter-revolutionary efforts, Castro and

his associates voice a warm, almost affectionate re

gard for the President's courage and realism. They

profess to have seen his death as a grave setback to

more hopeful relations between the two countries

The John Kennedy of 1963 was not, in their judgment,

he same man who was inaugurated in 1961, but a,

more mature, poised and forward-looking leader, with i

whom they could have done business.

With this frame of reference, Cuban officials specu.:

late that the real origin of the assassination lies in an-.

ti-Castro circles, with which Oswald also was in touch.

• They emphasize that assassination is incompatible

with their own revolutionary doctrine and that they

never contemplated it even against Batista, the pre--

vious Cuban ruler. And they volunteer the suspicion

that the recent murders of Sam Giancana and Johnny

Rosselli, the Mafia figures who consorted with the

CIA to kill Castro, surely have some connection with

Cuban exile politics and the Kennedy murder.

Castro has said publicly that he has no proof "count.

but that is clearly the consensus in Havana. Further

investigation may still be inconclusive, but, far from :

seeing it as an impediment to Cuban-American rela-

, tions, the Castro regime welcomes such an inquiry.

Their curiosity seems greater than their completi

Could Rosselli Have Linked

Castro Plot to JFK Death?

By RON LaBRECQUE

In 1960, when the CIA was try-

• ing to set up a delicate attempt on

the life of Fidel Castro, it turned to

a man once described as "the big-

gest flag-waving SOB in the coun

Coast underworld

• figure Johnny Rosselli.

Rosselli - a seemingly improba-

¡ble conspirator in a

plot — got the "flag-waving" label

from Salvatore (Momo) Giancana,

¡then Chicago's top crime boss and

a man Rosselli brought into that

Now both are dead, murdered in

the past year, and investigators are

wondering

whether their

plotting

led to their deaths and whether the

CIA plots against Castro - only

recently made public and even kept

from the Warren Commission -

are vitai clues to the John F. Ken-

nedy assassination.

The deaths of Giancana, in June

of 1975, and Rosselli, this summer,

have aroused a renewed concern in

Washington, where on Friday the

House of Representives voted to re-

open the investigation of the Ken-

nedy murder.

REP. THOMAS N. Downing (D.,

Va.), who will be chairman of the,

panel, said he is "convinced" a con-

spiracy was involved in Kennedy's

death.

Now, in the aftermath of the vi-:

olent deaths of Giancana and Ros-

selli, the question arises of what

role, if any, the Kennedy White

House

played in the early 1960s

"deal" the CIA made with the two

underworld figures to have Castro

murdered.

Whether "the Kennedy" Whité'

House knew about about the. CIA's

plotting (Robert F. Kennedy found

out after the contacts were ended),

the ClA's use of the underworld

seems ironic in retrospect.

• Robert Kennedy's passionate ef-

forts to disable organized crime are

well documented.

IN 1960 when Robert Kennedy

wrote about what he had learned

of organized crime in America

from his years as chief counsel to

the Senate Rackets Committee, he

•t00 quoted Giancana to make a

He told about Giancana's inter-

view at his local draft board at the

outbreak of World War II, when

he was asked what he did for a liv-

ing steal," Giancana is said to

have replied.

So Sam Giancana didn't go to

war and years later would boast to

Chicago reporter Sandy Smith that

he stayed out of the Army - la-

beled unfit — by telling the truth.

"What's wrong with the syndi-

'cate?" Kennedy quoted Giancana.

"Two or three of us get together

Son a business deal and

"says it's a bad thing. Businessmen

A Senate committee began stu-:

"dying the Kennedy questions more

than a year ago as it looked at co-

{vert CIA activities.

IN AN addendum to the Senate

¿report last November, Sen. Howard

(Baker (R., Tenn.) said,

personal view that on balance the

likelihood that presidents (the re-

port dealt with Dwight Eisenhoweri

and Kennedy) knew of the (Castro)

assassination plots is greater than

the likelihood that they did not."

lust to trace Rosselli's history

with the ClA is mind-boggling

the investigators. Yet, it is just one

aspect of the search for his killer.

Johnny Rosselli - born on the

fourth of July in Esperia, Italy, and

71 when he died - was not first

and foremost a ClA operative.

÷ His greater role as evidenced by :

two convictions, his

associations

and to some extent his own .com-

ments, was as an influential, if

publicly lesser known, organized

crime figure.

• HIS ASSOCIATION with other

identified

underworld

members.

was monitored by law enforcement

agencies

as recently as several:

weeks before his July 28 disap-

pearance.

• By all accounts, Rosselli was a i

charming man, dressing in expen-

'sive clothes, married for only two

years in the

early

1940s

and

iknown most of his life as one who

leasily attracted women.

He was an immigrant who told

lin a short autobiography written

tabout 1967 that his

"life of crime"

¡began as a teenager in Boston, at-

tempting arson for his stepfather

and stealing $50 on his own. As her

traveled west, finally to settle in

California, his attention turned to:

bootlegging,

gambling

and dab-

'bling in the movie business.

IT IS said that Rosselli guarded

the West Coust gambling interests

for Giancana's Chicago syndicate.

Why Rosselli was chosen by the

ClA for a Castro plot in 1960 is un-

Clear, although ClA officials have

since testified that they wanted the

'kind of contacts in Cuba which or-

ganized crime had made during the

pre-Castro days when Havana was

a. gamblers' haven.

Giancana was enlisted by Rossel-

li because he had influence with :

Florida's Santo Trafficante, consid-:

ered the key underworld gambling

figure in Havana.

The unraveling of CIA and un-?

derworld conspiracies, an awesome

web spanning decades, is left to a

tean of nine in the Metro Homicide

Division. It is a team now clearly

consumed by the task which has

been a full-time operation

Rosselli's body was pulled from

Dumfoundling Buy on Aug. 7.

HH 54923 DocId:32423629 Page 49

## Page 50

• THAT THE Metro team is even

involved is happenstance. Rosselli

lived in Plantation, Broward Coun-

ty, with his sister and brother-in-

law. It's just that his killers chose

• to dump his body in Dade.

While.

several

detectives say

their instincts lead them to con-

clude that the Rosselli murder was

an internal underworld affair, all

on the team are aware of the pres-

sure on them to search each clue

that leads back to the CIA-Castro

affair.

• With Rosselli's death this sum-

iner, the newly appointed Senate

committee saw its list of knowi-

edgeable witnesses further trim-

med. Some of those witnesses have

died violently and some from natu-

rai causes.

• When Giancana was murdered in

June of 1975, before he could even

be questioned by the committee

staff, authorities attributed it to an

internal gangland struggle - even

though. the murderer is still. un:

known.

• The death of Rosselli, who had

appeared

before the

committee

three times in the past year with-

out immunity, caused greater con-

cern on Capitol Hill.

THE SAME night Rosselli's body

was identified - the legs hacked

off and stuffed along with the body

into an oil drum - Baker, vice

chairman of the Senate Intelligence

Committee, called for the FBI to

get involved in the case. (Several

days later, Attorney General Ed-

ward Levi ordered FBl involve-

ment.)

It wasn't until

several weeks

later, however,

that

what

was

known to Baker became public

knowledge.

A section of the former commit-

tee's April report told of a Wash-

ington attorney who in 1967. went.

to

Supreme Court. Chief Justice

Earl Warren (chairman of

the:

then-disbanded

Commis-

sion) to say that two' of his clients?

believed they knew about Cuban

agents in the United States who

conspired in the assassination of

John F. Kennedy.:

THE INFORMATION; eventually

• reached the FBl, but as the senate

committee concluded this year, the

1967 FBI probe was slipshod

and

incomplete.

One of the clients referred to in

the report has since been identified

as Rosselli. And it has since been

learned

that Rosselli

was con-

vinced he held a vital clue to the

JFK murder.

ROSSELLI told Morgan

the CIA plot in 1967, when the De-

partment of Justice was vigorously

attempting to deport Rosselli for

being an illegal alien.

Rosselli, Morgan said, "was cer-

tain that the people he (Rosselli) :

put around Castro in the CIA plot :

turned right around and killed Ken-

nedy. The people he still knew in

1967) did it."

Rosselli, according to Morgan,;

decided to talk about his CIA activi

ity in hopes of decreasing the pres-

sure from the FBI and Department

of Naturalization and Immigration,.

both Justice Department agencies.

Several friends of Rosselli, in-

cluding Morgan, say they are con-;

vinced the FBI tried to get Rosselli :

to become an organized crime in-:

formant by threatening

him deported if he didn't coopera-:

through a bungled

wiretap

effort,

FBr became:

aware of Rosselli's CIA activities.

• While Giancana

Rosselli :

were in Florida planning the opera-

tion, Giancana wanted to return to

Las

. Vegas

to check on his girl

friend, Phyllis McGuire, whom he

suspected' of dating comedian Dan

Rowan. To keep Giancana in. Flori-

da, it was agreed that a bug would

be placed in her hotel room and her

conversations monitored.

But the private detective they

hired, with CIA money. it has since

been learned, was discovered and

arrested. Eventually the police in-

vestigation led back to the Castro

plotters.

Prosecution was avoided when

the CIA intervened and said the

"national interest" would be dam-

aged if the plot information be-

came public.

WHEN THE wiretap case was

again to be investigated in 1966,

this time by a Senate committee

headed by the late Sen. Edward

Long (D., Mo.), the CIẠ again step-

ped in to stop it.

Morgan was told about the pend-

ing investigation by Rosselli and

Robert

Manue,

a former FBI

agent-turned Howard Hughes aide

who was the CIA's initial link to

Rosselli.

Mahue told Morgan that both he

and Rosselli had been subpenaed to:

appear before the committee. Mor-!

gan said he called Lawrence Hous®:

ton, the CIA general counsel. Hous-

ton went to Long and the investig

gation was dropped.

MORGAN SAID he knew, as the:

Senate committee recently

empha-:

sized as well, that all information:

• about the CIA plots - which could

have been the incentive for pro-'

Castro forces to kill Kennedy -;

had been kept from the Warren:

Commission.

"I was an admirer of Earl War-

ren," Morgan said.

"(His) report!

said that ... Oswald alone killed:

Kennedy. It kept bugging me after

so gruesome a detail from Rosselli

that the Chief Justice could put his

name on a report which didn't as-:

sess the most significant piece of

evidence bearing. on the killing of

Kennedy."

The

information Morgan

had

was passed to Warren via colum-

nist Drew Pearson, a

mutual:

friend. Eventually, it reached

the:

FBI, but, remarkably, even after di-

rect orders from President Lyndon

Johnson in the spring of 1967, in-:

vestigation was not vigorously pur.:

THE SENATE Intelligence Com-

mittee compared that apparent in-

action with a statement former FBI

director J. Edgar Hoover made to

the Warren Commission on May 5,

1964. Hoover said,

"well, I can as--

cerned the case will be continued:

ing to us or any report coming to;

A Senate Committee staff memb,

ber commented recently,

gation which the FBI should have

done in 1967 - and no one can

come close to explaining why it.

wasn't — is actually being done:

Smathers has since said Kennedy

rejected the idea and that the dis-

Senate report, "can also lead to the

use of euphemism and circumlocu-

Another alleged link between

the White House and the under-

world plotters, first made public by

the Senate Committee,

involved. Judith Campbell Exner,

the woman who claims to have

dy's closest advisers told The Her-

ald recently,

"The Giancana-Ros-

her, but he was naive about those

that on March 22, 1962, Hoover

What Rosselli told the federal

grand "jury about the Frontier in

1971 is unknown. Rosselli didn't

testify later at the trial at which

Anthony J. Zerilli and Michael Pol-

izzi and the Emprise Corp., among

others, were convicted.

ZERILLI and Polizzi are still in

jail. In 1973, the House of Repre-

sentatives

Select Committee

on

Crime probed the influence of or-

ganized crime in sports - and one

area they looked at was Emprise

and the Frontier Hotel case.

At the time of the conviction, the

federal prosecutor asked that Poliz-

zi and Terilli be jailed immediately

because

monitored,

wiretapped

conversations showed that the two

had talked about "murder, the kill-

ing of certain individuals."

An intimate associate of Rosselli,

however,

discounts the possibility

that Rosselli's grand jury appear-

ance could have led to his death.

"They know Johnny didn't talk to

the grand jury," the associate said.

JOE BREEN said Rosselli hadn't

been to Las Vegas for nine years,

that "he's never even seen the gift

shop."

Since his prison release and

move to Plantation, Rosselli wasn't

trying to regain power; according

to his friends.

"He had no muscle."

said an associate."I can't believe

Rosselli was getting back into mob

stuff."

But at the same time,

many of

the associates

were

surpised to

learn about Rosselli's recent visits

with alleged organized crime fig-

ures on the West Coast.

Several associates speculate that

Rosselli wanted to get involved in

casino gambling, preferably in the

Middle East, and was looking for

someone with money to back him..

"MY IMPRESSION was that he

was broke," Morgan said.

"He told

me last

straite ,;Year; 'I'm. in. bad financial.

Scheer said Rosselli's income in-:

cluded about $60,000 from the gift

shop and about $3,500 in social se-

curity, most of

back fees to attorneys and for gov-

ernment fines.

One friend said. that just before

Giancana's death, Rosselli had ac-

cepted Giancana's

offer of money.

The friend was to act as the inter-

mediary. "Let me figure out what

1. The following CIA Staff Employees, all of whom

are

now retired, participated in the preparation of DIR

86054

on 30 November 1963:

Originator:

Mr. Louis Armstrong

Coordinators: Mr. John M. Whitten, Mr. William

B. Tyng, Ms. Sue L. Darling

Authenticator: Mr. William B. Tyng. ("'for"

Desmond FitzGerald)

Releasor: Mr. John M. Whitten ("'for" J. C. King)

2.

We believe that the Italian diplomat on the Cubana

flight No. 465 on 22 November 1963 from Mexico City to Havana,

Cuba;

was Mario MAURI who was accompanied by his wife, Maria

Antonieta MAURI. Ne have been unable to determine who trans-

mitted the information contained in DIR 86054 to CIA and we

have not been able to locate any documents relating to this

matter in Latin America Division files or the Oswald files.

3.

We have been unable to locate any documents which

would indicate that there was a response to DIR 86054 from

Mexico City.

4. Assuming there was no response to DIR 86054, the

originating Headquarters component should have initiated

follow-up action if a response was not received.

5. We have been unable to find any further information

relating to DIR 86054 in Latin America Division files.

JACK ANDERSON

Plot to kill

Kissinger

blocked

WASHINGTON - A reported plot to assassinate Sec-

retary of State Henry Kissinger in Costa Rica six months

ago was blocked by US and Costa Rican authorities four

days before it was supposed to be carried out.

We have pieced together the story from secret lestimn-

ny before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee and

from interviews with Cuban exiles and US intelligence

A Cuban terrorist named Orlando Bosch Avila was re-

ported to be gunning for Kissinger. The attempt on the

Secretary's life was expected, according to underground

reports, during his visit to Costa Rica last February.

Shortly before Kissinger's arrival, Bosch slipped into

Costa Rica on a false passport. But the FBI and Secret Ser-

vice had been alerted. They traced Bosch's movements and

notified the Costa Rican authorities. The suspected assas-

sin was arrested and clapped into a tiny jail cell four days

before Kissinger got to town.

The plot to kill Kissinger apparently grew out of his

overtures to improve relations with Cuba's Fidel Castro

back in 1972. This reportedly upset an anti-Castro terrorist

band, known as Cuban Action, which Bosch headed.

We reported part of the story two years later after a

lengthy investigation in Miami. In columns on Sept. 1 and

Nov. 12, 1974,

we

warned that anti-Castro terrorists

planned an "assassination ... against American congress-

men and businessmen who supported a….. thaw." We noted

that Kissinger had been in touch with Castro.

The first hint that Kissinger, himself, was one of the

• targets came later from Carlos Rivero Collado, son of the

man elected to the presidency of Cuba in 1958. Rivero was

active in the anti-Castro underground in Miami's little

Havana. But he later re-defected to Cuba where he gave a

fascinating interview.

"I have known privately since 1972," he said, "(about)

the plan to assassinate the US Secretary of State." He said

the plot had' taken "certain form" by 1973 and had. been

"actualized" by 1974..

Then, in a reference to our 1974 columns, he added:

"This fact which, I repeat, I've known privately, has been

corroborated by the US journalist Jack Anderson."

Rivero named Bosch as one of the 18 anti-Castro l

ers who had conspired to kill US and other leaders prom

ing a Cuban-American detente. Bosch arcady had be

convicted in 1968 of shelling a Polish freighter with a b

zooka while it was moored in Miami. He jumped Feder

parole and fled to Venezuela ir 1974.

Months later, he was reported to be in Curacao, prc

lected by Chilean gunmen. He bragged, according to th

reports, of his "money, friends and protection."

Florida's Dade County Public Safety Department, be

cause of the huge Cuban population in Miami, has excellent

ties throughout Latin America. In early 1976, tbe county's

terrorist expert, Lt. Thomas Lynch, picked up some electri-

fying news.

He told the Senate Subcommittee about it in secret tes-

timony. "We received information from confidential sourc-

es," he swore, "that there was going to be an attempt on the

life of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger... We passed the

information on to the FBI, and they had also received the

information, and we notified the Secret Service, as they.

have the protective duty for the Secretary of State."

The plot was linked to Kissinger's two-day stay in Cos-

ta Rica, and Bosch was picked up and questioned. He was

held on a false passport charge until Kissinger was safely

out of the country.

Bosch later insisted: "My only crime was entering the

country with a false passport." Certainly, it was never

proved in court that he hoped to knock off Kissinger. He is

now at large somewhere in Latin America.

Slain Mobster Claimed

Cuban Link 1o /FK Death:

By Ronald Kessler and Laurence Stern

Washington Post Staff Writers

Long before his recent murder,

John Rosselli, the CIA's underworld

recruit in attempts to kill Fidel Cas-

tro, had been privately claiming that

agents of the Cuban premier, in retali-

ation, were involved in the assassina-

tion of President John F. Kennedy.

Rosselli's belief in a Cuban connec-

tion to the Kennedy assassination was

expressed through his attorney,

Ed-

events.

Here, is the

sequence, pieced

to-

§ether 'from the testimony given to

Senate intelligence investigators:

• Columnist. Drew Pearson went to

the late Chief Justice of the United

States Parl

Warren late in Janualy,

1967, and told him that a Washington

lawyer had confided to him that one

of his clients

said the United States

"had attempted to assassinate Fidel

Castro in the early 1960s and Castro

had decided to retaliale."

Warren declined Pearson's sugges-

tion that he see the lawyer, who was

Edward Morgan. Warren referred the

matter to then Secret Service Direc-

tor James J. Rowley, who on Feb. 13,

1967, wrote FBI Director J: Edgar Ho-

over, informing him of the allegations.

Hoover sent the Rowley letter to six

senior bureau officials on

an

"eyes-

only" basis. There is no record of FBI

meetings or discussions of those alle-

gations. At that point the sensitive let-

ter bounced back and

forth in the

higher reaches of the FBI bureauc-

racy.

The job of responding to Rowley's

letter was assigned to the supervisor

of the FBI's General Investigative Di-

'vision who was given responsiility for

the overall assassination investigation

This official's job was complicated

by the fact that he had never been in-

circle of confidants in the FBI learned

nent American underworld figures; in-

cluding Posselli and Giancana, had

RE: PRESIDENT'S CONMISSION

The Commission in questioning Kellerman made specific

reference to the underscored portions of the above paragraph

as it contradicts some of Kellerman's testimony. Kellerman

claims he did not hear the President nor Mrs. Kennedy say

these things and had never told our Agents that he had.

denter to

In

part of Kellerman's denial he stated "I don't know where they

got those quotes."

OBSERVATIONS:

Kellerman is claiming our Agents furnished inaccurate

accounts of a conversation with him.

It is to be remembered

that at the time this conversation with our Agents reportedly

took place 11-22-63, Kellerman had been a security guard in

the President's car

Ka more than

and more than likely was upset and feeling

remorse over

the days episode.

In his testimony before the

Commission hosendeavored to give the impression that he acted

• calmly and immediately took command, issuing logical instructions

after the Presiddnt was hit.

The conversation reported by

our Agents made it appear kellerman reacted normally to the

tragedy and not dramatically as indicated in his testimony,

as he didn't order the driver to the hospital until after the

President had so directed.

It is felt our Agents reported accurately what

Kellerman told them on 11-22-63, and that kellerman's testimony

3y months later is the result of considered deliberation, on

his part,

to paint the

most favorable picture possible, under

the circumstances, for the Secret Service.

Consideration has been given to discussing this matter

vith Chief Rowley of Secret Service,

hovever, since it is the

word of our Agents against Kellerman's, it is not felt any good

purpose would

be served by this course of action.

RECOMMENDATION:

Affidavits are being obtained from our Agents Sibert

and O'Noill attesting to the accuracy of their report and

refuting Kellerman so that we will be in a position to show

any future inquirer that we recognized this contradiction and

did something about it.

THE WHITE HOUSE

SECRET - EYES ONLY

January 9, 1964

MEMORANDUM TO THE PRESIDENT

SUBJECT: Sabotage against Castro

Three small-scale sabotage operations have been approved by the

Special Group, but this recommendation is based on a routine con-

tinuation of broad policy guidance which I think you may wish

to review.. The three operations involved are:

(1) a commando sabotage operation against a coastal

warehouse and pier;

(2) a sabotage attack against naval or patrol vessels in

a harbor; and

(3) a sabotage operation against a fuel barge proceeding

in coastal waters..

All of these operations would have been approved three months ago,

and indeed one of them is a rescheduling of an operation aborted

because of high seas. While it is always hard to predict-the noise

level in these matters, these operations seem comparable to the

small attack on a Cuban naval patrol which occurred in late December

which Castro promptly blamed on you (in fact it was an operation

approved before November 22 and not cancelled thereafter because it

seemed to fall within the guidance you expressed in your first review

of the Cuban problem).

The policy question now is this: If we continue these even small

sabotage operations, Castro will certainly know it. Equally, if we

call them off, he will know it, and so will the Russians.

We thus

have an opportunity to choose.

I doubt if this choice should be made on momentum alone.

I therefore recommend a Cabinet-level review of the whole principle

of covert sabotage against Cuba.

I know that Rusk has never liked it

and that McNamara thinks it does very little good.. McCone and the CIA

are for it, and so are most of the middle-level officers dealing with the

Castro problem. I myself consider the matter extremely evenly balanced,

but before hearing full argument, my guess is that in your position

I would stop sabotage attacks on the ground that they are illegal,

ineffective, and damaging to our broader policy. I might then wish

to make a little capital from this decision with the Soviet Union.

Connection Between Amlash Operation and Investigation

of JFK Assassination

DATE :

SUBJ:

Background

The staff's memorandum of January 5, 1976, postulated that the

mlash operation might have had some effect or

'CIA's response to

he investigation of President Kennedy's assassination.

On January

9, 1976, the staff asked for access to the Amlash file at CIA; and

after a delay which was not explained, the

staff was permitted to

review the file on January 23 and 26.

y Summary of Amlash File

Amlash initially contacted by CIA in 1961 met occasionally with

case officers through August 1962, at which time he was given instruc-

tion in secret writing and explosives.

Interest in Amlash continued

after the August meetings, but there was no further direct contact by CIA

agents until mid-1963.

Why there was a year lapse in contact with Am-

lash cannot be determined; the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962

undoubtedly made CIA cautious in dealing with Amlash.

In any event, DIR 48198*

to Rome of 19 June 1963 states that

Amwhip, a Cuban exile who assisted CIA, had sent a letter as part of

an "activation effort to reluctant dragon." Presumably, Amlash was

"reluctant dragon"

'and was, by this letter, asked to recontact CIA.

In late August, Amlash traveled with a large contingent of Cuban

officials and athletes to Porto Alegre, Brazil.

He cabled Amwhip

about his arrival on August 29.

This cable apparently was the signal

that he was

prepared to meet Anwhip in Porto Alegre.

Amwhip and two CIA case officers met with Amlash in Porto Alegre

between September 5 and 8. The two case officers have testified to

the Committee about their understanding of events at this series of

meetings which they viewed essentially as a get acquainted session.

CIA messages tell a different story.

• Porto Alegre 0704 to DIR öf 7

September stated that Amlash told Anwhip he felt there were only two

ways of getting rid of Castro.

The first was an invasion by U.S.

forces which Amlash knew was out of the question and the second was

an "inside job."

Amlash indicated he was awaiting a U.S. plan of action.

He referred to the explosives demonstration CIA gave him a year earlier

as "too cumbersome" for his purposes.

At the conclusion of the meetings with Amlash, Headquarters

cabled on 9 September that, based on

what little feel Headquarters

had, Amlash appeared hopeless as an intelligence performer and should

be approached as a chief conspirator allowed to recruit his own co-

horts.

He should be urged to recruit a

few trusted friends to assist

him, initially in "FI and Ops reporting" and then progress to sabotage

and:more serious matters on an orderly basis. (DIR 67110 to Porto

Alegre, JMWAVE and Rio.)

On 11 September, Porto Alegre 0708 to DIR summarized the intel-

ligence information Amlash had given on Soviet units in Cuba, saying

all IRBM and bombers had been removed. By this time Amlash had left

Brazil apparently heading for a vacation in Europe.

A document in the file dated 16 September and marked OFPA 72775

appears to be a transcript of a conversation obtained by covert means.

There is no indication as to where the conversation takes place, but

it probably is in the Cuban Embassy in Paris.

"Mary: I don't want to imagine things but

this thing of Amlash.

Moreno:

It is either a tremendous secret or a

top secret matter (unreadable) then the

word "treason"

or "reason").

Betty: I believe it is a top secret matter."

By letters of September 14 and September 16, Amlash stayed in

contact with Anwhip.

Paris station apparently was picking up responsi-

bility for Amlash at this? time, since

Paris 0706

to DIR dated 19

September asks for some background material on Amlash.

On 19 September, JMWAVE 4580 to DIR warns that Amlash is part of

an anti-communist group in Cuba and details the membership of his group.

as well as a communist group.

The message also notes that Fidel is

allegedly aware of the two groups and acts as moderator between them

in order to maintain cohesion in the Government of Cuba.

Nevertheless, Auwhip is asked to continue to work with Amlash

and is assigned to accompany him around Europe. According to Paris

0934 to DIR dated? October, Amlash met with case officer O* on 5

October.

Case officer O sat and listened permitting Amlash to get

everything off his chest.

Amlash seemed to be complaining about the

low level espionage matters that had been discussed at the September

meeting in Brazil, implying he had a more valuable role.

Case officer

O "provided necessary assurances his feelings not in fact true and

that his case receiving consideration highest levels. (emphasis added)!"

"With this problem which had undoubtedly been bothering Amlash

siderably, off his chest, a much more relaxed Amlash departed restating

his desire return Cuba to undertake 'the big job!""

On October. 15, London 5224 to DIR states case officer O met with

Amlash and Amwhip on 13 October.

Although the case officer had been

forewarned by Anwhip, he was not successful in discouraging Amlash's

request for a high level meeting.

"Amlash convinced that if such meet

does not take place at this time

it will be almost impossible come out

again and we will be in same situation as last year with no definite

decision. Also finds it difficult to believe why RFK who receives many

Cubans would refuse to see a major"

such as Amlash.

The message notes

the fact remains that Amlash does "have excellent entree to highest

target level which believe we cannot afford overlook."

This message seemingly moved Headquarters to re-evaluate Amlash's

role.

DIR 75683 to London on 15 October directed case officer O to

return headquarters soonest for discussions of all phases of the case.

The next meeting apparently took place on October 29. One case

officer met Amlash holding himself out as the personal representative

of REK.

He informed Amlash, according to a 13 November MFR, that

the U.S. was prepared to render all necessary assistance to any anti-

communist Cuban group which succeeded in neutralizing the present Cuban

to render assistance. He emphasized that U.S: support could come only

after a successful coup. Amlash responded by saying that without Fidel,

he military would break up into 4 or 5 groups and the regime would

disintegrate.

He also said he was satisfied with the policy discussior

but desired to know what technical support he could get.

Since Amwhip was closer to Amlash than the case officers, he was

asked about Amlash's reaction to the

meeting.

His reactions are

summarized in Attachment A to Amwhip's Memo of Meeting dated 14 Novem-

beI.

Amwhip said Amlash was still not pleased with support from U.s.

government.

While Amlash was satisfied on policy grounds, he was not

at all happy with the fact that he still was not given the technical

assistance for the operation plan as he saw it. Amlash could not under-

stand why he was denied certain small pieces of equipment which promised

a final solution to the problem, while, on the other hand, the U.S. gave

much equipment and money to exile groups for their ineffective excursions

against Cuban coastal targets.

Amlash had accepted the fact he had to

work with the clA, but ClA might lose him if it continued to procrastin-

ate.

Amlash talked about going

to the wrench terrorist organization,

real so trate are cue ane

the OAS, but realized that was not feasible.

The memorandum ends with

what apparently is the author's conclusion:

"It is hoped that he does

that Havana must first be taken

.. or failing that, a

truly sizeable piece of land (say, almost an entire province) which

could be true rallying point."

In a Memo for Record dated 19 November, one case officer summarized

the actions to be taken at the next meeting with Amlash.

Amlash

was

to

be told the U.S. was prepared to give full support to Amlash's coup.

He would be shown President Kennedy's speech in Miami of November 18

and told this reaffirmed support for Amlash's proposal. Headquarters

memo ended by stating that "C/SAs* requested written reports on Amlash

operation be kept to a minimum."

Pari 1564 to DIR of 20 November indicated Amlash had been called

on the night of November 20 and had

agreed to postpone his return

Cuba in order to see case officer O "if it something interesting.,,fo

CIA officer said he could not assure it was interesting but that

The

it was

to be a meeting which Amlash had requested. (Obviously, CIA wanted to

give Amlash the "technical support" he felt he had not been promised in

the 29 October meeting.)

Case officer O flew from the U.S.. so as to arrive in Paris on the morn-

ing

of November 22 for this meeting.

Pari 1607 to DIR received at Langley at 6:25 a.m. on 23 November

is the only message in Amlash's file reflecting the fact the meeting

had taken place.

It indicated that Amlash was anxious to return to

Cuba and that case officer O was to arrive in Washington at 1810 that

day.

The file contains no outgoing cable to Paris on November 23 or

any other time telling Paris to break contact with Amlash. **

On 25 November, a contact report was prepared. There is reason

to question the authenticity of this document which is three pages

and reports the 22 November meeting with Amlash.

On 3 December, Headquarters

furnished JMWAVE some details on the

Amlash meeting including the fact that he had been promised "full U.S

support if he is successful in a real coup

He was

against the Castro regime."

also promised arms which will have to be furnished through

JMWAVE's operations.

A series of confusing cables passed between Headquarters and JMWAVE

on December 6, 7, and 8.

Apparently, Headquarters first gave IMWAVE

authority to drop a cache of arms in

Cuba.

Then Headquarters called

off the operation.

In DIR 87615 of ? December, it is noted "major

top level Cuban/Caribbean policy review scheduled early next week which

should provide basis for decision."

JIMWAVE complained about the change in orders in a cable of 8

December.

JMWAVE 8702 pointed out that one Headquarter's message

indicated December infiltration operations were approved by higher author-

ity but a second message indicated a scheduled operation should be de-

layed and not run in December.

Headquarters responded in DIR 87880. Headquarters procedure

was

to present infiltration operation plans to "higher authority"

even though there is a reasonable chance operation may

be postponed

or delayed as was case with the scheduled operation.

"This procedure

will secure approval for the operation with only telephonic reconfirma-

tion needed when previously relaxed operation finally mounted." Head-

quarters recommended delay until January after considering and equating

objectives against risk factors for Amlash and others.

"Believe by

January, CIA should be in position better evaluate status of internal

assets.

By Pari 1914 of 13 December, Paris reported that Amlash left

Paris for Prague on November 27 but did not seek recontact with case

officer. DIR 90966 to JMWAVE of 23 December reported that Havana radio

2 December stated Amlash arrived Cuba on 1 December.

The last document in Amlash's file for the period ending December

1963, is a long report on Amlash, but it does not contain information

relevant to the October-November

activities.

Nevertheless, in red pen

nat document, a rough draft of

a biographical information sheet on Amlash (no final draft was found)

appears to have been prepared in 1966 at the time of Amlash's arrest

for a later plot against Castro.

It states:

"22 Nov. 63 Mr. Fitzgerald

and Mr. Sanchez assured subject that this Agency would give him every-

thing he needed (telescopic sight, silencer,

all the money he wanted).

The situation changed when Mr.

Sanchez and Mr. Fitzgerald left the meet-

ing to discover that President Kennedy had been assassinated. Because

of this fact, plans with subject changed and it was decided that this

included the following.

"We would not furnish the silencer,

nor scope

nor any money for direct assassination; furthermore, we would not lift

a finger to help subject

escape from Cuba should he

assassinate Castro."

The same document states this message was communicated to Amlash

in November 1964 by Mr. Sanchez.

Despite this decision, the CIA in fact continued to assist Amlash

through a cut-out until Amlash's arrest in 1966.

Later documents on Amlash are also relevant to the September-

November 1963 Amlash operation.

Several such documents report informa-

tion received to the effect that Fidel Castro had long been aware of

Amlash's plots against him. For example,

Amlash's one time Cuban

mistress was believed to be working for Cuban intelligence and her

brother was known to be with Cuban

intelligence. Pari 8242 to DIR

in December 1964 warns that Amlash's objective may be known to too

many Cubans. And, one CIA informant reported in 1966 on one known

double agent of Cuban intelligence working for CIA and said the CIA's

Cuban operations had been penetrated at a high level by Cuban intel-

ligence.

He identified this latter individual only as one of the Cuban

-—

exiles who was knowledgeable of a number of the most important opera-

tions.

Nevertheless, Amlash's file contains nothing to indicate any

detailed analysis of these possible penetrations of the CIA's Amlash

operation,

although a cryptic handwritten note on at least one re-

port rejects the suggestion that Amlash was himself reporting to Castro.

One other document bears on the testimony Amlash's case officers

gave before the Select Committee to the effect that Amlash was given

a poison pen for self-protection. That document reports that Amlash,

and other Cuban officials in Paris in 1963, were carrying pistols for

self-protection throughout their travel in Europe.

finally, although the staff has not reviewed all possible ClA

files to determine what other operations Castro might have been re=

ferring to in his September 7 statement, the Amlash file indicates

that some coastal landings of supplies in August were the only other

CIA operations conducted against Cuba in this time period.

arms cache, the U.S. will take such measures agalast

the Castro/communist regine in Cuba as it deems appro-

priato ln the circunstances.

6. Explain carefully through diplomatic

chinools to tho soviet Union that the United States

finds tho present behavior of the Castro/communist

rogino 1n Cuba Intolerable, that Cuba's activitles in

Venezuela prove this to be so and that further acts

of violence of comparable danger or potential danger

on the part of Cuba will cause the U.s. to feel no

longar bound by any inhibitions against invasion or

other appropriate action. Urge the soviet Unlon, in

ordor to reduce tensions in the Carlbbean and permit

tho U.S, to llve pescofully with the Castro/communist

regime 1s Cuba, to assure that Cube 1s restrained

Iron repeating its dangorous practices. Make 1t plain

to the sovlet Union that further behavlor of this sort

by Castro w1ll compel the U.S, to adopt drastic measures.

Point out to the soviet Unlon the physical vulnerability

of Cube as well as the effect a fallure to resolve the

Cuban problem will have on the traditional policy which

the U.S. has pursued of not exerting pressures upon the

Soviets' European satellites. Make 1t plain that the U.s.

desires peaco in the Caribbean and expects the soviet

Union to achiove good behavior on the part of castro.

7. Docide upon the type of action on the part

of Castro which would triggor action on the part of the

U.S. A rula of thumb could be: such action as would

represent serious, realized or potential, danger to the

stability of a latla American state. By this crlterion

20 Castro-trained men and four tons of arms introduced

into northeast Brazil might not constitute a trigger,

whereas the sane effort by Castro 11 a Central American

country might. The judgment can be unilateral and

subjactive on the

part of the U.s.

8. Formulato a progran for a post-Castro Cuba

giving full weight to the real changes which have taken

place there during the past five years and full recog-

sition to the nood for channeling Castro's unfinished

revolution into constructive lines.

The abovo scenario should not be commenced unless

It 1s recognized that, although these actlons are

prinarily designed to deter Castro fION his present course,

he may very well persevere in his policy. Under such

circunstances the U.S., having publicly embarked on the

doctrine, cannot then withdraw fron the corsequences.

SPECTRUM OF COURSES OF ACTION WITH RESPECI TO CUBA

Accopting as valid the Attorney General's statement

that thers is no point in discussing courges of action

with respect to Cuba until the lundamental decision is

nado as to whether or not it 1s possible for the United

States to live with Castro, the following possible

courses of action are listed under the headingy "Can

Live with Castro" and "Can't Live with Castro." Neither

of these headingy is absolute; the courses of action

listed under each are indicative of degrees of accepta-

bility of the castro regime or conversely the urgency

to overthrow 1t.

COURSES OF ACTION

A. Can Live with Castro

1. Negotiate a detente with Fidel looking towards

full recognition of his regime and unfinited trade

between the United States and Cuba.

The negotiator of

the detente would endeavor to secure from Castro com

mitnents not to engage in subversive activities in

Latio Anerica and not to engage in polemies against

the United States. He would also endeavor to reduca

or eliminate, as a result of our concessions, Soviet

presenca in Cuba and reduce the Cuban military machine

to one compatible with the requirements of a peaceful

Latin American island republic.

No covert activitlas would bo undertaken and

intelligence operations would be of a

nature compat-

ible with our relations with a neutral power.

It would be hoped that fidel, recognizing

inar friend:

Thanks you for your prompt reply. Enclosed are your card and receipt, along

with our thanks and welcone.

Your interest in helping to form an FPCC Chapter in New Orleans 18 gratefully

received. I shall try to give you some basic information now so that you may have

a botter sicture of what this entails.

For one thing, I an enclosing a copy of our constitution and ly-laws for all

Chapters and Student Councils. You will note that there is considerable autonomy

for an organization our sizo. Me try and let all Chapters operate according to the

Local requirements.. Naturally, there a minimul regulations which must be mit.

(111 chapters can receive literature in bulk at a discounted rate and resell at

the ritail price and use the proceeus for further Chapter activities) Credit is

citended and payment is not required with the order. lie do expect payment within a

reasonable period so that we may continue our end of the operation.

It would be hard to concieve of a chapter with as few mèmbers as seem to exist

in the New Orleans area. I have just gone through our files and find that Lousiana

scens somewhat restricted for Fair Play activities.. Horever, with what is there

perhaps you could build a larger group if a fer people would undertake the disciplined

responsibility of concrete organizational work.

expect that there woild be at least trice the amount noeded to conduct a logal executiva

I for one am convinced of the possibility of such an enterprise but know from

You must realize that you will come under tremendous pressures with any attempt

to do FPCC work in that area and that you till not be able to operate in the manner

which is inventional here in the north-east. Even most of our big city Chapters have

been forced to abandon the idea of operating an office in public. The national office

here in New York is the only one in the country, today and the New York City Chapter

uses

our office too so it is the only Chapter with an office. Most Chapters have dis-

covered that it is easier to operate semi-privately out of a home and maintain a P.o.

recommend that you engage in one at the very beginning but wait and see how you can

tive." Second question: What does the American gov-

ernment expect to gain from the blockade? Is the

economic isolation of Cuba a punishment or a political

maneuver?

Kennedy's reply: "Are you suggesting that the polit-

ical effectiveness of the blockade is uncertain (smile]?

You will see when you go to Cuba whether it is or not.

In any case, we can't let Communist subversion win in

the other Latin American countries.

Two dikes are

needed to contain Soviet expansion: the blockade on

the one hand, a tremendous effort toward progress on

the other. This is the problem in a nutshell. Both battles

are equally difficult." (Silence.) Then, a last comment:

"The continuation of the blockade depends on the, con-

tinuation of subversive activities."

The interview was over. I did not really wish to sug-

gest anything, since I had never been to Cubal and,

on the other hand, I had heard from all sides tales of

the privations the Cuban people were suffering owing

to their isolated economic situation. But I could see

plainly that John Kennedy had doubts, and was seeking

a way out.

That same evening I recounted this conversation in

detail to an American colleague - on intimate friend of

President Kennedy, through whom I had obtained this

interview -and to the editor of The New Republic.

Both my confidants, who knew the President a thou

sand times better than I, agreed that John F. Kennedv

had never before expressed hitertaso specifically and

with such feeling on his understanding of the first;

phase of the. Castro revolution. They hesitated to draw

any political conclusions from his remarks. However,

they were not surprised at Kennedy's invitation to

come and see him again when I returned from Cuba.

In effect, John Kennedy displayed two basic charac-

teristics in his exercise of power: first, an overwhelming

degree of empiricism and realism. A man without a

particular doctrine, he reacted decisively to events, and

only to events. Nothing but the shock of collision with

a problem was sufficient to make him come to aldeci-i

sion, and because of this, his decisions were unpredic-

table. At that point he had a consuming. need for

information, and this need had increased a great deal

since experience had taught him not to rely solely on

official channels.

After this, I went to Havana.

Night Session

TABM

In the "Pearl of the Aller rum-perfumedi

steeped in triumphant sensuality," as Cuba is described

in those American tourist folders still lying about in

the hotels of Havana, I spent three closely packed and"

intensive weeks, but thinking all along that I would

never get to meet with Fidel Castro. I tallied with farme.

eis, writers and painters, militants and counter-revo

lutionaries, ministers and ambassadors - but Fidel re-

mained inaccessible. I hid been warned: he was snowed

under with work; as a result of the hurricane, the

Cuban government had been obliged to revise its whole

planning program; and then, above all, he no longer

had any desire to receive any journalists, least of all

after all), Fidel came to my hotel. He had heard of my

interview with the President. We went up to my

room at to in the evening and did not leave until 4 in

the following morning. Here, I shall only recount that

part of that interview which constitutes a reply to John

F. Kennedy's remarks.

est: he pulled at his beard, yanked his parachutist's

beret down over his eyes! adjusted his maqui tunic, all.

sparks cast by his deep-sunk, lively eyes. At one point

I felt as though I were playing the role of that partner

with whom he had as strong a desire to confer as to do

battle; as though I myself were in a small way that

intimate chemy in the White House whom Khrushchev

described to Fidel as someone with whom "it is pos-

sible to talk." Three times he had me repeat certain.ie-

marks, particularly those in which Kennedy expressed

his criticism of the Batista regime, those in which Ken-

nedy showed his impatience with the comments attrib-

uted to General de Gaulle, and lastly those in which

Kennedy accused Fidel of having almost caused a war

fatal to all humanity.

When I stopped talking, I expected an explosion..

Instead, I was treated to a lengthy silence and, at the

end of that silence, to a calm, composed, often humor-

ous, always thoughtful exposition. I don't know wheth-

er Fidel has changed, or whether these cartoons cari-

caturing him as a ranting madman which appear in the

Western press perhaps correspond to a former reality.

I orily know that at no time during the two complete

days I spent with him (and during which a great deal

happened), did Castro abandon his composure and

poise. Here too, I shall let Castro speak for himself,

reserving only the possibility of correcting certain judg-

ments on these two political leaders based on my own

experiences in Cuba.

"I beliere. Kennedy is sincere," Fidel declared. "I

also believe that today the expression of Sis sincerity

could have political significance. I'll explain what I

chiavellian tactics and the equivocation, the attempts at

invasion, the pressures, the blackmail, the organiza un

of a counter-revolution, the blockade and, above evily

thing, all the retaliatory measures which were impused

hefore, long bufore there was the pretext and alibi of

Communism. But I feel that he inherited a difficult

situation; I don't think a President of the United States

is ever really free, and I believe Kennedy is at present

feeling the impact of this lack of freedom. I also believe

he now understands the extent to which he has been

misled, especially, for example, on Cuban reaction at

the time of the attempted Bay of Pigs invasion. I also

think he is a realist; he is now registering that it is in-

possible to simply wave a wand and cause us, and the

explosive situation throughout Latin America, to dis-

appear.

Why the Missiles Were Installed

"There is one point on which I want to give you ilew

information right away. I have refrained from doing

this until now; but today an altempt is being made to

frighten all mankind by propagating the idca that

Cuba, and in particular I, might provoke a nuclear war,

so I feel the world should know the true story of the

missile emplacement.

"Six months before these missiles were instilled in

Cuba, we had received an acmultion of information

warning us that a new invasion of the island was being

prepared under sponsorshief the Central Intelligence

Agency, whose administrators were humilialed by the

Bay of Pigs disaster and by the spectacle of being

ridiculed in the eyes of the world and heraied in US

goyernment circles. We also knew that the Peitagon

was vesting the ClA preparations with the mantle of

its authority, but we had doubts as to the attitude of

the President. There were those among our informants

who even thought it would suffice to alert the President

and sive him cause for concern in order to arrest these

preparations. Then one day Khrushchev's son-in-law,

Adzhubei, came to pay us a visit before going on to

Washington at the invitation of Kennedy's assóciates.

Immediately upon arriving in Washington, Adzhubei

had been received by the American Chief Exccutive,

and their talk centered particularly on Cuba. A weck

after this interview, we received in Havana a copy of

Adzhubei's report to Khrushchev. It was this report

which triggered the whole situation.

"What did Kennedy say to Adzhubei? Now listen lo

this carefully, for it is very important; he had said that

- the now situation in Cuba was intolerable for the Unit-

"ed States, that the American government had decided

it would not tolerate it any louger; he had said that

peacetul coexistence was seriously compromised by the

fact that 'Soviet influences' in Cuba altered the balance

of strength, was destroying the equilibrium lagreed

18

upon and fat this point Castro emphasized his state-

ment by pronouncing each suble separatelyl Ken-

neily reminded the Russians that the United States

had not intervened in Hungary, which was obviously

a way of demanding Russian non-intervention in the

event of a possible invasion. To be sure, the actual word

communicated to Khrushchev all our previous informa-

tion, the Russians too began to interpret the Kennedy-

Adzhubei conversation as we saw it and they went to

the source of our information. By the end of a month

the Russian and Cuban sovarnments had reached the

definite conviction ithat an invasion might take place

from one moment to the next. This is the truth.

"What was to be done? How could we prevent the

invasion? We found that Khrushchev was concerned

about the same things that were worrying us. He asked

to realize this objective? All our thinking and discus-

sions revolved around this point. We thought of a

proclamation, an alliance, conventional military aid.

The Russians explained to us that their concern was

twofold; first, they wanted to save the Cuban revolu-

tion (in other words, their socialist honor in the eyes

of the world), and at the same time they wished to

avoid a world conflict. They reasoned that if conven-

tional military aid was the extent of their assistance,

the United States might not hesitate to instigate in

invasion, in which case Russia would retaliate and this

would inevitably touch off a world war."

At this point I interrupted to ask how Cub.: could

have been absolutely certain of Soviet intervention.

After all, I said, Stalin certainly "let down" Markos,

the Chief of the Greek Communist Resistance, because

such help would have conflicted with prevailing zones

of influence.

"I know," Castro replied, "but the two situations

cannot be compared." Then he continued:

"Russia was much too deeply committed to us. More-

over, since then we have had every proof of the im-

mense solidarity of the Soviet people and its leaders.

You can sce for yourself how clearly this solidarity is

manifest here. Then there is. something else, specifi-

cally apropos of Stalin. When I was in the USSR and

others, outside Russia, were reproaching Khrushchev

for taking a more conciliatory stand than Stalin toward

the capitalists, Khrushchev confided to me several ex-

amples, which I will not repeat to you, illustrating the

prudence, even the abdication of Stalin. He told me -

and I believe him - that Stalin would never have em-

placed missiles in Cuba.

"It is true that it was said then by other factions

that the real

reason for installing the missiles

because certain internal problems were driving the Rus-

sians to use us to provoke the United States. I am here

to tell you that the Russians didn't want and do not

today want war. One only need visit them on their

home territory, watch them at work, share their eco-

nomic concerns, admire their intense efforts to raise the

workers' standard of living, to understand right away

that they are far, very far, from any idea of provocation

or domination. However, Soviet Russia was confronted

by two alternatives: an absolutely inevitable war (be-

cause of their commitments and their position in the

socialist world), if the Cuban revolution was attacked:

or the risk of a war if the United States, refusing lo

retreat before the missiles, would not give up the at-

tempt to destroy Cuba. They chose socialist solidarity

and the risk of war.

"Under these circumstances, how could we Cubans

have refused to share the risks taken to save us? It

was, in the final analysis, a question of honor, don't

you agree? Don't you believe that honor plays a role

in politics? You think we are romantics, don't you?

Perhaps we are. And why not? In any event, we are

militants. In a word, then, we agreed to the emplace-

ment of the missiles. And I might add here that for un

Cubans it didn't really make so much difference

whether we died by conventional bombing or a hydro-

gen bomb. Nevertheless, we were gambling with

the peace of the world. The United States was the one

to jeopardize the peace of mankind by using the threat

of war to stifle revolutions.

"And so in June, 1oo2, my brother Raoul and Che

Guevara went to Moscow to discuss ways and means

of installing the missiles. The convoy arrived by sea in

three weeks. The United States was able to find out

that weapons were being shipped in, of course; but it

took them tio months to discover that these weapons

were guided missiles. Two months... in other words,

longer than we had calculated. Because, of course, ive

were seeking intimidation, not aggression."

Alliance for Progriss

The conversation now turned to the Alliance for Prog-

ress..

"In a way," Castro said, "it was a goud idea, it

marked progress of a sort. Even if it can be'said that it

was overdue, timid, conceived on the spur of the

moment, under constraint... despile all that Kam will-

ing to agree that the idea in test constituted an effort

to adapt to the extraordinarily rapid course of events in

Latin America. Such as, for example, what we read in

he papers this morning - did you see the news? That

Argentina is nationalizing the oil industry? The Argen-

tine government! Do you realize what that means? This

will cause more commotion on the dew York stock

exchange than Castroism!' The Catholic and military

conservatives of. Argentina, the factions most closely

linked with American interests! There is talk of na-

tionalization of industries there, of agrarian reform

there….. well and good! If the Alliance for Progress

provokes these developments, then it's not doing so

badly; all there things are consonant with the aspira-

tions of the people. I can look back to the days of

Eisenhower, or rather of Nixon, and recall the furore

which broke out when the United States and Cuba to-

gether decreed an agrarian reform which was to apply,

mark this well, only to landowners of over 200,000

hectares! Yes, 200,000! Yet the reaction of the trusts

was terrible at that time. Nowadays, in the other Latin

American countries, because the Communist banner is

used as a bogeyman, the rcaction of the American

trusts is shrewder: They are going to choose strawmen,

so as to rule indirectly. But there will be difficulties.

"This is why Kennedy's good ideas aren't going to

vield any results. It is very casy to understand and at

this point he surely is aware of this because, as I told

you, he is a realist. For years and years American policy

- not the government, but the trusts and the Pentagon

- has supported the Latin American oligarchies. All the

prestige, the dollars, and the power was held by a class

which Kennedy himself has described in speaking of

Batista. Suddenly a President arrives on the scene who

tries to support the interests of another class (which

has no access to any of the levers of power) to give the

various Latin American countries the impression that

the United Sates no longer stands behind the dictators,

and so there is nin mure need. to start Castro-type revo-

lutions: What happens then? The trusts see that their

interests are being a little compromised (just barely,

but still compromised); the Pentagon thinks the strate-

yie bases are in danger; the powertul oligarchies in all

the Latin American countries alert their American

friends; they sabotage the new policy; and in short,

Kennedy has everyone against him. The few liberal or

allegedly liberal presidents who were chosen as instru-

ments of the new policy are swept out of office, like

Bosch in Santo Domingo, or else they are transformed

Betancourt, for example, was not a Balista; noir he

has become one.

"In view of all these things, how can the American

government seriously believe that Cuban subversion is

at the root of explosions taking place all over the

South American continent? In Venezuela, for, example,

are you familiar with the situation there? Do You think

the Venezuelans need us to inderstand what's going

un in their country? Do you think we don't have

enough problems of our own? Right now I ask only

one thing: Leave. us in peace to better our country's

economic situation, to put our planning into effect, to

educate our young compañeros. This doesn't mean we

do not feel solidarity toward nations that are struggling

and suffering, like the Venezuclan people. But it is up

to those nations to decide what they want, and if they

choose other regimes than ours, this isn't our business.

"We Have Alionys Lived with Danger".

I asked Fidel where is this all going to end? How will

the situation develop? Even if the United States uses

against you what you call the alibi of Communism, it

still remains true that you have chose! Communism,

that your economy and your security depend on the

Soviet Union, and that even if you have no ulterior mo-

tives in this association, still the United States considers

that you are part of an international strategy, that you

constitute a Soviet base in a world where peace depends

on mutual respect for a tacit division of zones of in:

fluence.

"I don't want to discuss our ties with the Soviet

Union." Fidel Castro cut me short. "I find this indecent.

We have none but feelings of fraternily and profound

total gratitude toward the USSR. The Russians are

making extraordinary efforts on our behalf, efforts

which sometimes cost them dear. But we have our own

policies which are perhaps not always the same (we

have proved this!) as those of the USSR. I refuse to

divell on this point, because asking me to say that I am

not a pawn on the Soviet chessta is something like

asking a woman to shout aloud in the public square

that she is not a prostitute.

"If the United States. sees the problem as you have

posed it, then you are right, there is no way out. But

who is the loser in the last analysis? They have tried

everything against us, crerything, absolutely every-

thing, and we are still alive and getting better day by

day; we are still standing upright, and we plan to cele-

brate with greater festivities than usual, on January 1,

1964, the fifth anniversary of the Cuban Revolution!!

The United States policy of isolating us economically

is less effective with each passing day; we are increas-

ing our trade with the rest of the world. Even with

Spain! We have just sold a shipment of 300,000 tons

of sugar to the Spaniards. Far from discouraging us,

the blockade is maintaining the revolutionary atmos-

phere we need to stiffen the country's backbone. Are we

in danger? We have always lived with danger. To say

nothing of the fact that you have no idea how many

friends one discovers in the world when one is perse-

cuted by the United StalaaNd truly, for all these

reasons, we are not suppliants, we ask nothing. I'll

tell you something else: since the rupture and the

blockade, we have forgotten the United States. We feel

neither hatred nor resentment any more, we simply

don't think about the US. When I think of the problems

would pose! The Swiss Ambassador istepresenting the

Us at present. I prefer to do business with him than

with 2oo members of an Embassy among whom surely

some spies would be spotted.

"I have just talked to you as a Cuban revolutionary.

But I should also speak to you as a peace lover, and

from this viespoint I believe the United States is too

important a country not to have an influence on world

peace. I cannot help hoping, therefore, that a leader

will come to the fore in North America (why not Ken-

nedy, there are things in his favor!), who will be willing

to brave unpopularity, fight the trusts, tell the truth

and, most important, let the various nations act as

they sec, fit. I ask nothing, neither dollars, nor assist-

ance, nor diplomats, nor bankers, nor military men -

nothing but peace, and to be accepted as we are! We

are socialists, the United States is a capitalist nation,

the Latin American countries will choose what they

want. All the same, at a time when the United States

is selling wheat to the Russians, Canada is trading with

China, de Gaulle respects Ben Bella, why should it be.

impossible to make the Americans understand that

socialism leads, not to hostility toward them, but to co-

existence? Why am I not Tito or Sekou Touré? Because

the Russians have never done us any injury such as

the Yugoslavians and the Guineans have complained

of in the past, and because the Americans have never

given us any of the benefits for which these two nations

congratulate themselves today.

"As to this matter of fearing Soviet intentions in

Latin America through Cuba's subversive activitio:..

this is just attributing to others one's own desire tu

dominate. You said yourself just a little while ago tha:

the Russians have had enough of their Cuban involve-

ment. Economically this is obvious. This is why, speak-

ing from a military viewpoint, it is better not to force

nations io turn to the Russians for help. Really, it

seems to me that a man like Kennedy is capable of

seeing that it is not in the United States' interest to

pursue a policy which can lead only to a stalemate. So

far as we are concerned, everything can be restored to

normalcy on the basis of mutual respect of sover-

eignty."

In conclusion, Fidel Castro said to me: "Since you

are going to see Kennedy, again, be an emissary of

peace, despite everything. I want to make myself clear:

I don't want anything, I don't expect anything, and

as a revolutionary the present situation does not dis-

please me. But as a man and as a statesmin, it is my

duty to indicate. what the bases for understanding

could be."

All this was said two days before President Ken-

nedy's death.

contained the following:

(OBTAIN COPY] (signed by Peter Jessup)

"A paper was discussed on alleged plans which involve.

the underworld to assassinate certain Cuban leaders.

Mr. McCone was somewhat skeptical of the reported plots and

stated that he would like to go into the matter further.

Others, including Mr. Bundy, felt that the United States was

being put on notice and should do everything in its power to

and pay a de chat got a and pove

ascertain promptly the veracity of the reports and then under-

take prevention.

It was decided that Mr. Bundy would call the

matter to the Attorney General's attention as a

matter of law

meeting (dated) June 18, 1964, contains substantially the same

the talk revolved about the impressions I recounted

to him of an interview which President Kennedy

granted me this last October 24, and about Fidel

Castro's reactions to these impressions. During this

nocturnal discussion, Castro had delivered himself of

• relentless indictment of US policy, adding that in the

recent past Washington had had ample opportunity

to normalize its reiations with Cuba, but that instead

it had tolcrated a CIA program of training, equipping

und organizing a counter-revolution. He had told me

that he wasn't in the least fearful of his life, since

danger was his natural milieu, and if he were to become

I virtim of the United States this would simply en-

ha. his radius of influence in Latin America as well

is throughout the socialist world. He was speaking, he

said, from the viewpost of the interests of peace in

an even greater President than Lincoln. I know, for

example, that for Khrushchev, Kennedy is a man you

can talk with. I have gotten this impression from all

my conversations with Khrushchev. Other leaders have

assured me that to attain this goal, we must first await

his re-election. Personally, I consider him responsible

for everything, but I will say this: he has come to

understand many things over the past few. months;

and then too, in the last analysis, I'm convinced that

anyone else would be woise." Then Fidel had added

with a broad

and boyish grin: "If you see him again,

you can tell him that l'milling to declare Goldwater

my friend if that will guarantee Kennedy's re-election!"

This conversation was heid on November 19.

Now it was nearly a o'clock and sc got up from.

the table and settled ourselves in front of a radio.

Commandant Vallero, his physician, aide-de-camp, and

intimate friend, was casily able to get the broadcasts

from the NBC network in Miami. As the news came

in, Vallero would translate it for. Fidel: Kennedy

wounded in the head; pursuit of the assassin; murder

of a policeman; finally the fatal announcement: Presi-

dent Kennedy is dead. Then Fidel stood up and said to

me: "Everything is changed. Everything is going to

change. The United States occupies such a position in

world affairs that the death of a President of that

country affects millions of people in every corner of

the globe. The cold war, relations with Kussia, Latin

America, Cuba, the Negro question... all will have to

be rethought. I'll tell you one thing; at least Kennedy

was an enemy to whom we had become accustomed.

This is a serious matter, an extremely serious matter.

After the quarter-hour of silerice observed by all

the American radio stations, we once more tuned in

on Miami; the silence had only been broken by a re-

broadcasting of the American national anthem. Strange

indeed was the impression made, on hearing this hymn

ring out in the house of Fidel Castro, in the midst of a

circl of worried faces. "Now," Fidel said, "they vill

ha: to find the assassin quickly, but very quickly,

otherwise, you watch and see, I know them, they wi?

try to put the blame on us for this thing. But tell i

how many Presidents have been assassinated? Fou

This is most disturbing! In Cuba, only one has bee;

assassinated. You know, when ive were hiding out i

the Sierra there were some (not in my group, in an

other) who wanted to fill Batista. They thought they

could do away with a regime by decapitating it. I have

always been violently opposed to such methods. First

of all from the viewpoint of political self-interest, be-

cause so far as Cuba is concerned, it Batista had been

killed he would have been replaced by some military

figure who would have tried to make the revolutionists

pay for the martyrdom of the dictator. But I was also

opposed to it on personal grounds; assassination is

repellent to me."

The broadcasts were now resumed. One reporter

felt he should mention the difficulty Mrs. Kennedy

was having in getting rid of her bloodstained stockings.

Fidel exploded: "What sort of a mind is this!" He re-

peated the remark

several times: "What sort of a

mind is this? There is a difference in our civilizations

after all. Are you like this in Europe? For us Latin

Americans, death is a sacred matter; not only does it

mark the close of hostilities, but it also imposes de-

cency, dignily, respect. There are even street urchins

who behave like kings in the face of death. Incidentally,

this reminds me of something else: if you write all

those things I told you yamalay against Kennedy's

policy, don't use his name now; speak instead of the

policy of the United States governmcit."

Toward 5 o'clock, Fidel Castro declared that since

there was nothing we could do to alter the tragedy, we

must try to put our time to good use in spite of it. He

wanted to accompany me in person on a visit to a

granja de preblo (state farm), where he had been en-

gaging in some experiments. His present obsession is

agriculture. He reads nothing but agronomical studies

and reports. He dwells lyrically on the soil, fertilizers,

and the possibilities which will give Cuba enough

n the Cho doug,

sugar cane by 1970 to achieve.economic independence.

"Didr't I. Tell You"

We went by car, with the radio on. The Dallas

police were now hot or the trail of the assassin. He

is a Russian spy, says the news commentator.. Five

minutes later, correction; he is a spy marricd to a

Russian. Fidel said: "There, didn't I tell you; it'll be

-myturn next." Butes jil. The next word was; the

assassin is a Marxist deserter. Then the word came

through, in effect, that the assassin was a young man

who was a member of the "Fair Play for Cuba Com-

mittee," that he was an admirer of Fidel Castro. Fidel

declared: "If they had had proof, they would have said

he was an agent, an accomplice, a hired killer. In

saying simply that he is an admiss, this is just to try

and make an association in people's minds betwech ihe

name of Castro and the emotion awakened by the

assassination. This is a publicity method, a propaganda

device. It's terrible. But you know, I'm sure this will .

all soon blow over. There are too many competing

policies in the United States for any single one to be

able to impose itself universally for very long."

We arrived at the granja de preblo, where the farm-

ers welcomed Fidel. At that very moment, a speaker

announced over the radio that it was now known that

the assassin is a "pro-Castro Marxist." One commen-

tator followed another; the remarks became increas-

ingly emotional, increasingly aggressive. Fidel then

had questions: "Who is Lyndon Johnson? What is his

reputation? What were his relations with Kennedy?

With Khrushchev? What was his position at the time of

the attempted invasion of Cuba?" Finally and most

important of all: "What autherity doss he exercise

over the CIA?" Then abruptly he looked at his watch,

saw that it would be half an hour before we reached

Matanzas and, practically on the spot, he dropped off to

slecp.

After Matanzas, where he must have decreed a state

of alert, we returned to Varadero for dinner. Quoting

the words spoken to him by a woman shortly before,

he said to me that it was an irony of history for the

Cubans, in the situation to which they had been re-

duced by the blockade, to have to mourn the death of

a President of the United States. "'After all," he added,

"there are perhaps some people in the world to whom

this news is cause for rejoicing. The South Vietnamese

guerrillas, for example, and also, I would imagine,

Madame Nhu!"

I thought of the people of Cuba, accustomed to the

sight of posters like the one depicting the Red Army

with maquis superimposed in front, and the screaming

captions *HALT, MR. KENNEDY! CUBA IS NOT ALONE. .

I thought of all those who had been led to associate

their deprivations with the policies of President John

F. Kennedy.

At dinner I was able to take up all my questions.

What had motivated Castro to endanger the peace of

the world with the missiles in Cuba? How dependent

was Cuba on the Soviet Union? Is it not possible to

envisage relations between Cuba and the United States

along the same lines as those between Finland and the

Russians? How was the transition made from the

humanism of Sierra Maestra to the Marxism-Leninism

• of 1961? Fidel Castro, once more in top form, had an

explanation for everything. Then he questioned me.

The Cubans have lived with the United States in

In that very seitative city of Havana to wnich we re-

turned in the evening, where the luminous signboards

with Marxist slogans have replaced the Coca Cola and

toothpaste billboards, in the midst of Sovict exhibits

and Crechoslovakian trucks, a certain American emo-

tion vibrated in the aimosphere, compounded of re-

sentment, of concern, of anxiety, yet also, in spite of

everything, of a mysterious almost imperceptible rap-

prochement. After all, this American President was able

to reach accord with our Russian friends during. his

By Saturday night, even the television seemed worn

out by attempt and failure and ceased to comment and

gave over to a succession of photographs of the col-

imns and the window's and the corners of the White

House and of the shadows of the great Lincoln head

in Springfield and to a voice reciting

"Oh, Captain,

My Captain." It is to be, then, the grand style. But the

ship has. not weathered every storm; Mr. Kennedy is

not Abrahum Lincoln; not because he is. more or less,

but because he is a remembered physical presence and

Mr. Lincoln an image of the plastic aits. One's oun

time is personal, not historical. Just how long will it be

before many of us will want to read a book about the

day Mr. Kennedy was shot?

The news of the President's assassination was given

by a taxi driver to three gentlemen as they left a hotel

on Arlington Strect in Boston. They turned right

around and hurried back inside to allend in their in-

vestments. Packed with students and businessmen a

shuttle plane from Boston to Washingion ivaited for

permission to take off when the captain came on the

intercom: "Folks, up here on the flight deck we've been

listening to the news and the President is dead." There

was only time to hear one woman say, "How dread-

• ful" before three men went back to discussing plan

specifications. A college student reading denmemnon

:o visible attention. One of his notes read, "love-

in-ure!" The plane took off, the stewardess collected

the money and started to serve drinks. Then the cap-

tain was back again they had been listening to more

neivs, that is trying to listen to news because their

real job was lo hear flight control. There had been a

gun battle in Dallas; a patrolman was killed; the police

had taken a man in Tarrie theater. Vice President

Johnson was now the President. The talk of business

vient on through this, and stopped only when the cap-

tain again interrupted to say that the new President had

been sworn in aboard an aircraft. A few laughed.

Ther ask too much of us when they ask us to act up

to the grand style. We are not an emotionally affluent

people: And yet some of us always complained that

Mr. Kennedy did not seem quite emotionally commit-

ted enough. But now someone remembered with special

affection a moment late in the 1060 campaign. Mr.

Kennedy was in a motorcade and the Democratic gov-

cinor who was with him said how wonderful it was to

feel the love with which these crowds pressed forward

to feel the touch of their candidate. "Oh, dry up," Mr.

Kennedy said. It seemed now somehow a special grace

in him that he used only the real in emotion and ab-

stained from fabricating the expected. He had too much

respect for the grand style to counterfeit it; how much

truer to him might we have been if ive had come down

in scale and if the many of us who must have remem-

bered the lines from Cymbeline had thought them

ASSASSINATION OF PRESIENT KENNEDY

Brow

Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach telephoned at 10:50 a.m.

He said he had just completed talking on the telephone with Alexis Johnson,

Deputy Under Secretary of State. Johnson told Katzenbach that insofar as

the investigation of this matter in Mexico is concerned, the State Department

felt this should be coordinated and directed by the FBI. State took the

position that the President's directive to the FBI extended to any activity

outside of the United States, as well as within the country. Insofar as the

Ambassador in Mexico is concerned, Johnson believed he should be kept

informed of any pertinent developments but that the Ambassador should not

be running the investigation.

As to current developments, Katzenbach said that the last thing

he would want would be for the FBI to take Agents away from their investiga-

tive duties to prepare reports. He requested, however, that if there were

any pertinent_developments he be orally briefed.

Move son or titt contine EriK

With further reference to his conversation with Alexis Johnson,

Katzenbach said he had been asked whether the State Department should make,:

a formal inquiry of the Soviet Government for information concerning Oswald

and his wife, particularly as to their activities in Russia.

He asked tinat this.

question be considered by the Director, as Katzenbach felt his views most

important.

In thinking about the matter himself, Katzenbach noted if we

did not ask the Soviets for information there would be no answer should the

question of Oswald's stay in Russia be raised, other than to admit we had

made no inquiry. On the other hand, he observed that we could not place

any reliance on anything the Soviets said.

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont

following recommendations are submitted with reference to the points

raised by Nir. Katzenbach:

1. Insofar as making a formal approach to the Soviet Government,

we believe this undesirable. Such a formal request from the United States

will enable the Russians to put out an official statement entirely favorable

to them.. The United States will have to acopêt this, since it is in response

to our formal request, and we won't be in a position to disprove it. The

State Department has responsibility here and we should not dictate the

position they are to take, but our views should be stated.

2. In connection with the investigation in Mexico, it is

recommended Katzenbach be informed that the State Department and

Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) have jurisdiction in dealing with foreign

governments and in getting investigative results and intelligence coverage

abroad; that while we are cooperating fully with State and CIA in Mexico,

the responsibility in this matter should rest with State and CIA.

If approved, Katzenbach will be so advised."

Tel, (791) 534-3975

Dear Mr. Heacock:

Thank you for writing

to me regarding your knowledge of

the activities of the Central

Intelligence Agency.

I understand

that you have discussed these questions at length with members

of the Committee staff.

On March 1 the Committee reported S. Res. 400 creating

a Senate Committee on Intelligence Activities.

The legislation

which was betore us concerned only the establishment of a new

congressional committee; it did not involve revisions that would

n did no.

significantly modify the structure or the powers of the ClA it-

self.

The Conmittee has not been authorized to hire additional

staft personnel for the purpose of this legislation. Further-

we were under instructions from the Senate to report out

a.

formal recommendation in the form of legislation by March 1.

I am, however, deeply concerned with the charges you

have made because, if

true,. they represent grave examples of

corruption and criminality.! It is my hope and intent that the

new committee created by the legislation we are considering,

once it is established, will have the jurisdiction and the re-

sources to explore the

kind of issues which you raise.

I assure you that the entirety of the information you

have submitted to my committee will be made available to the

new Congressional oversight comnittee.

I am sure you understand the constraints on the Govern-

ment Operations Committee which prevent us from undertaking the

investigations you suggest, but I shall forward the material

you submitted to the new committee as soon as it is established.

For your information, I

am enclosing a copy of S. Res.

400 and a copy of the committee's report on this measure.

Sincerely,

Gile itin

MEMORANDUM

TO :

File

FroM:

Mason Cargill

Subject: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DOCUMENTS

On the afternoon of May 20, 1975, I briefly

examined the Justice Department files on the Kennedy assassi-

nation, ranging from February 18, 1969, to January 28, 1971.

According to Mr. Keeney and his secretary who has reviewed

these files in detail, they contain no memo from any State

Department employee who was in Mexico in 1963:

Basically these

files consist of letters from citizens, some referred from

congressmen, and press clippings relating to the assassination.

Mr. Keeney's secretary referred me to several

entries in these files respecting allegations by people

claimed to have been involved in the Kennedy assassination.

One claimed to have been a CIA agent.

There are also many

letters from assassination "nuts."

Other documents relate

to court proceedings to force FBI agents to testify in the

Clay Shaw trial in Louisiana.

One document is an FBI report, dated February 2,

1972,

stating that one Richard von Kleist had contacted the

FBI claiming he had information on the John F. Kennedy

assassination. Kleist claimed certain people conspired in

the Hotel Luna, Mexico City, in July, 1963.

Kleist was not

a State Department employee.

He appeared to be a free-lance

magazine writer.

te: Assassination of the President

that before looking at the FBI as to possible "leaks, " he should carefully examine his

own house. I told him I was quite thoroughly familiar with the way Guthman and

Rosenthal dealt with the press and that as he well knew the wire service people stayed

'constantly in Guthman's private office. I told him it was quite obvious to me how the

AP had learned that the report had been sent over to the Department.

Katzenbach reiterated that he had no complaints against the FBI. He

stated again that the purpose of his call was to tell me about Senator Russell's feelings.

He added that he had another reason for calling and that was to determine

if we could give him any ideas as to how Warren Olney could be dropped as Chief

Counsel of*the Presidential Commission. I told Katzenbach of our feelings concerning

Olney. He stated that he was presently working through Congressman Hale Boggs and

he thought he was going to be successful in getting Olney's name removed from

consideration. He told me that Boggs was very sympathetic.

Katzenbach mentioned that Waggoner Carr, the Texas State Attorney

General, would like very much to see the Director on Friday, 12-6-63. I asked him

what for. He stated that Carr had no particular motive in mind other than to indicate

io the press later on that he had discussed matters with the Director. I told him I could:

see no percentage in the Director's seeing Carr, that we were the investigative

agency and that Carr's dealings should be with the Department and the Presidential

Commission. Katzenbach indicated that the White House might think otherwise. He

stated that the President was most anxious for Carr to be given attention in Washington

inasmuch as Cafr was running for office next year. Ttold Katzenbach I knew this,

however, I still felt that the Director should not be injected into this matter.

Kat zenbach stated he would attempt to disuade Carr from seeing the Director, however,

Carr was quite persistent.

ACTION:

In view of the close friendship which Carr obviously has with the

President, the Director may desire to just shake hands with Carr without sitting down

and discussing facts concerning our report.

additional requests. Mr Rankin stated this was not intended as a criticis.

by the Bureau in its investigation.

He conrented that the Connission in,

been no effort on the part of the Bureau not to nake this information

available. "ir. Rankin stated that after some discussion concerning this

item, the members of the Commission directed Mr. Rankin to request the

Bureau for an explanation so that the record of the Conmission would show

the exact circuustances by which this item was omitted from the Dallas

An Extract From Kennedy's Address to Press

Washington Post, Tuesday, November 19, 1963, p. A15

(AP) Nov. 18 -- The following is a text of President Kennedy's address

tonight before the Inter-American Press

Association:

"The genuine Cuban revolution -- because it was against the tyran-

ny and corruption of the past -- had the support of many whose aims and

concepts were noble.

"But that hope for freedom and progress was destroyed.

"The goals proclaimed in the Sierra Maestra were betrayed in Havana.

"It is important to restate what now divides Cuba from my country

and from all the American countries: It is the fact that a small band

of conspirators has stripped the Cuban people of their freedom and hand-

ed over the independence and

sovereignty of the Cuban nation to forces

beyond the hemisphere.

They have made Cuba a victim of foreign imperial-

ism,

an instrument of the policy of others, a weapon in an effort dic-

tated by external powers to subvert the other American republics. This,

and this alone divides us.

As long as this is true nothing is possible.

Without it everything is possible.

Ready and Anxious

"Once this barrier is removed we will be ready and anxious to work

with the Cuban people in pursuit of those progressive goals which, a few

short years ago, stirred their hopes and the sympathy of many people

throughout the entire hemisphere.

"No Cuban need feel trapped between dependence on the broken prom-

ises of foreign communism and the hostility of the rest of the hemisphere.

For once Cuban sovereignty has been restored we will extend the hand of

friendship and assistance to a Cuba whose political and economic insti-

tutions have been shaped by the will of the Cuban people."

Unofficial Envoy

An Historic Report from Two Capitals

by Jean Danich

A recent trip. to the United States, followed by a journey to Cuba, made it

possible for me to establish a "'dinlogue" betincen the late President Kennedy ani

Prime Minister Fidel Castro. Since my arrival in Mexico, where this article is

being written, I have bech asked whether the impressions I derived from these

interviers could shed any light on the assassination of the President and on

future relations betecit Lyndon B. Johrison and Castro.

Last wech in these pages I muswered the first question by describing the re-

actions of Fidel Castro, with whom I was visiting at the time, to lol Ken-

nedy's death. Here I shall explore the second question by reconstituting the

Kennedy-Castro dinloguc from the viewpoint of one who uns a witness to it.

THE AUTHOR

TABL

President Kennedy received me at the White House

on Thursday, October 24: My appointment had been

iche luled for 5:30. I waited in the Cabinet Conference

'oom, and at 5:45 the President, following his usual

custom, came to look for me himself so that he could

escort me into his office. He apologized for the delay,

no! so much as a courtesy or to flatter me, but to ex-

plain the scheduling of his time, which seemed to be

ver: strictly organized. As we passed through the small

room where his secretary was working, we caught a

glimpse of Mrs. Kennedy leaving by a French window

on for way to the private garden of the White House.

The President called her back to introduce me..

Ic was still Indian summer in Washington. The

weather was very warm, and both the President and

Mr. Kennedy were very lightly dressed, thus enhanc-

ing the impression of youth, charm, and simplicity

which was in rather surprising contrast to the solemnity

of entering these august chambers. The President

(athletic looking in his well-tailored suit, speaking with

quick, abrupt gestures and a mobile expression but, at

times, freezing up and becoming disconcertingly, al-

moit, I would say, completely expressionless) invited

me to be seated on the semi-circular sofa which was in

the middle of his office. He sat in a rocking chair op-

posite the sofa. The interview was to last from 20 to 25

minutes, and it was interrupted only by a brief tele-

phone call.

The President immediately asked me how the French

situntion was developing. After my reply, he spoke

about General de Galle. He talked in a relaxed fashion,

like someone who has at last found solace in indiffer-

ence after having long been exasperated and fascinated.

John Kennedy was a man who liked to get to the heart

of a matter quickly, abanake decisions even more

rapidly. But this was not possible in dealing with de

Gaulle, who is more difficult to handle than Khru-

slichev. One day, impatient at not understanding the

General's reasoning and intent upon convincing him,

Kennedy telephoned de Gaulle direct. All in vain. Odd-

ly enough, however, since the recent visit of de Gaulle's

foreign minister, Couve de Murville, to Washington

Mr. Kennedy had ceased to be so deeply concerned

about Franco-American relations. The truth is, he had

made up his mind not to worry about them any more.

According to him, it was a waste of time.

"Mr. Couve de Murville and I both verified that we

didn't agree on anything," the President told me. "And

we agreed that such total disagreement was hardly cal-

culated to create a flourishing friendship beticen two

great Western nations. I came to the conclusion that

General de Gaulle's strategy, which is rather incom-

prehensible to me, requires a certain amount of tension

with the United States. It would seem that only through

this tension is it possible to restore to Europe the desire

to think for itself and renounce its torpid dependence

on American dollar aid and political guidance!"

President Kennedy went on to sum up, with con-

riseness and vigor, the points of disagreement between

the United States and France. On the subject of Ger-

many, nuclear policy, Europe, the : lea of "indepen-

ince," he told me what has since become public

THE iN REPUBLIC

knowledge. He added, however, that France had

strange way of manifesting

its independence, part.:

ularly, for example, on the subject of! Vietnam and

Cuba. It seemed ironic and irritating to him that the

French Chief Executive was apparently bent on telling

him how the Uniied States should proceed, without

assuming any risks himself. He told me that no one was

more appreciative than he of advice, information, and

even criticism; but that these were all the more valued

if the friends proffering them were themselves com-

mitted to a program of action.

I then asked Mr. Kennedy what could be expected

from General de Gaulle's proposed visit to the United

States next February. He replied: "Absolutely nothing."

But he followed this up immediately and with a broad

grin, as though savoring in advance the pleasure of

the impending meeting:

"It will be exciting, just the

same. General de Gaulle is an historic figure; he is de-

cidely the strangest great man of our time."

Relations with Cuba

Taking the initiative at this point, I brought up the

subject of Vietnam and Cuba, saying that the Gaullists

were not the only ones in France who deplored certain

mistaken US policies. I pointed out that the first time

Thad the opportunity of mecting John Kennedy, he

was a Senator and had just made a resounding speech

Havana? Here my notes are very specific, and I shall

let the late President speak through them:.

"We haven't enough time to talk about Vietnam,

but I'd like to talk to you about Cuba. Incidentally, our

conversation will be much more interesting when you

return, because Ben Bradlee (of Newsweek] tells me

you are on your way to Cuba now.

"Every now and then I read articles in the European

press pointing out that we Americans were blind to

What was happening in the Cuban situation. I have just

learned that General de Gaulle himself regarded Com-

munism in Cuba as nothing but the 'accidental and

temporary form of a will to independence from the

United States. Of course it is very easy to understand

this 'will to independence around President de Gaulle."

John Kennedy then mustered all his persuasive force.

He punctuated each sentence with that, brief, mechan-

ical gesture which had become famous:

"I tell you this: we know perfectly what happered

in Cuba, to the misfortone du all. From the beginning

I personally followed the development of these events

with mounting concern. There are few subjects to which

I have devoted more painstaking attention. My conclu-

sions go much further than the European analyses. Here

is what I believe.

16

"I believe that there is no country in the world, in-

cluding all the African regions, eluding any and all

the countries under colonial domination, where cco-

nomic colonization, humiliation and exploitation were

worse than in Cuba, in part owing to my country's

policies during the Batista regime. I believe that we

created, buill and manufactured the Castro movement

out of whole cloth and without realizing it. I believe

that the accumulation of these mistakes has jeopardized

all of Latin America. The great aim of the Alliance for

Progress is to reverse this unfortunate policy. This is

one of the most, if not the most, important problems in

American foreign policy. I can assure you that I have

understood the Cubans. I approved the proclamation

which Fidel Castro made in the Sierra Maestra, when

he justifiably called for justice and especially yearned to

rid Cuba of corruption. I will go even further: to some

extent it is as though Batista was the incarnation of a

number of sins on the part of the United States. Now

we shall have to pay for those sins. In the matter of the

Batista regime, I am in agreement with the first Cuban

revolutionaries. That is perfectly clear."

After a silence during which he was able to note my

surprise and my interest, the President continued: "But

it is also clear that the problem has ceased to be a

Cuban one, and has become international - that is, it

has become a Soviet problem. I un the President of the

United States and not a sociologist; I am the President

of a free nation which has certain responsibilities in the

Free World. I know that Castro betrayed the promises

made in the Sierra Maestra, and that he has agreed to

be a Soviet agent in Latin America. I know that thraigh

his fault - either his 'will to independence, his nad-

ness or Communism - the world was on the verge uf

nuclear war in October, 1962. The Russians understond

this very well, at least after our reaction; but so far as

Fidel Castro. is concerned, I must say I don't know

whether he realizes this, or even if he cares about it."

A smile, then: "You can tell me whether he does when

you come back. In any case, the nations of Latin Amer-

ica are not going to attain justice and progress that

way, I mean through Communist subversion.. They

won't get there by going from economic oppression to

a Marxist dictatorship which Castro himself denounced

a few years ago. The United States now has the pos-

sibility of doing as much good in Latin America as it

has done wrong in the past; I would even say that we

alone have this power - on the essential condition that

Communism does not take over there."

Mr. Kennedy then rose to indicate at the interview

was over. I apologized for keeping him to ask two

quick questions. The first: Could the United States

tolerate cconomic collectivism? He answered: "What

Interview of John Roselll

On Wednesday February 20, 1974, Scott Armstrong, Marc Lackritz and Bob

888 17th Street, N. W., Washington, D. C., telephone 833-1440. Also present were

Wadden's associates Bryan B. McMenamin and Leslie Scherr.

Wadden began the interview by noting that for the first time, he had

discussed with Roselli the Maheu Cuban matter with

which

we were concerned; add

Pound that it presented a great problem of national security.

Accordingly he had

tried to reach Senator Ervin,.

an old acquaintance, and see if he could persuade the

Senator from allowing this interview to go forward.

Ervin directly but talked to & staff member in Ervia's office, whou he would it

about his Cuban activities and would rather go to jail than be coupelled to testify

He did not get in touch

about the matter.

He has been living In retirement with

them since he left jail at the end of last summer. Prior to moving to Florida he

had been in the federal prison for thirty-three months, having been convicted in the

Friar's Club case, a conspiracy in which he was charged along with Maurice Friedman,

Benjamin Teitlebaum, and Manuel Jacobs. (He noted that Hank Greenspun had no involve-

ment either as & co-defendant or unindicted co-conspirator in that case.)

With regard to Bob Maheu, he met Maheu for the first time in the mid-50's

in either Washington or, California

through & mutual acquaintance, Hernan Spitzel.

When questions were asked as to what his

Rosel11'a attorney instructed alm not to luberent quotyene ta the Men of,

Roselli did however indicate how he and Maheu had made arrangements for

Hughes

to live at the Desert Inn when Hughes first arrived there in late 1966. He

said that he had received a call from Maheu, who needed to make arrangements for

Hughes to move to las Vegas from Boston.

According to Maheu, no one wanted to give

Fughes any rooms. Roselli at the request of Maheu left his residence in Los Angeles

and went up to las Vegas and asked his acquaintance. Ruby Kolod, who owned 13% of

the Desert Inn, to accommodate Hughes and allow him to take two of the penthouses:

at the Desert Inn. At the time Maheu was in charge of security and responsible for

seeing that Fughes arrived unnoticed in Las Vegas.

Kolod acquiesced and told

Rosellf that the top floor of the Desert Inn would be available at the going rate,

but that they would have to leave the hotel by New Years.

When the New Years date

was approaching, Maheu called and said that they had received notice fron Kolod and

were suppose to leave their premises.

Rosell then convinced Kolod to allow

them

to stay. At the same time he told Maneu that Fughes should buy the Hotels an

and avoid

any problems:

Maheu responded that he was of the impression that highes dian'th

to purchase the hotel. It was at this point that Roselli conceived of the idea of

receive a finder's fee. Roselll then turned around and-asked Maheu if he wanted to

purchase 1t.

Maheu responded that he would and Roselll turned the matter over to

his attorney Fd Morgan who then handled the matter until the end.

Rosell1 also

instigated some talk about the possibility of purchasing the Sands and, while he did

not negotiate it, received at a later date from Fd Morgan a check for $95,000 which

represented his finder's fee for the sale of both the Desert Inn and the Sands:

Rosell noted that while Moe Dalitz was the owner of the Desert Inn, he

did not negotiate with him because he found him less agreeable than Kolod. He

said

that he had some minor dealings with Dalitz but none of them related to matters

concerning the Las Vegas hotel Industry.

With regard to Ed Morgan, Roselli met him in the middle 50's. Since that

time Morgan has represented him in different Las Vegas Interests. He noted that

Morgan did not represent him in his Friars' Club defense (but did arrange-for JIm

Cantillion, a Los Angeles attorney to handle the matter). He said that he had no

trouble with Morgan's handling of the Desert Inn finder's fee, since he trusted

Morgan Implicity. He noted that Morgan had arranged for John

Rosell to be represent

by Tom Wadden, his present attorney. This representation first began on the appeal

Prom the Friar's Club.

Roselli Indicated that his only present interest in Las Vegas concerns

his holdings in the gift shop at the Frontier hotel. His involvement there started

In 196T when he had an arrangement with Mr. Friedman. This set-up did not work

out

Thereafter he made an arrange-

ment with & Mr. Breen whereby he would furnish Breen with money and lidemnify him

against any losses if Breen would run the gift shop.. This arrangement has worked

out fairly well and he continues to receive his share of the profits each year from

the gift shop. He mentioned that it was his opinion that Breen had been poorly

treated by the Fughes enterprises, since Hughes first purchased the Frontier.

He

recalls, at his last meeting with Maheu, asking Maheu to lend Breen $60,000 for the

gift shop. Maheu said he would get back to him but never did.

Ultimately a loan

was arranged through Perry Thomas at the Valley Bank of Nevada.

Since 1967 Rosell has seen Maheu only once. And while he does not recall

the date of that meeting he remembers that it was in Los Angeles before Maheu had

terminated with Hughes.

He recalls that Maheu was in Los Angeles at the time while

his wife was having a foot operation, and that he called Roselll to have supper.

Roselli has no recollection of the conversation that the two had at supper other

than that they discussed, as noted above, the possibillty of arranging a loan for

Breen at the Frontier Hotel Gift Shop.

He said he has known Peter Maheu since the middle 1950's and that he went

to Peter's wedding reception. His only involvement with Peter occurred whenever

Robert Maheu wanted a message conveyed to Roselli. He recalls no subsequent substantu

discussions with Peter Maheu.

He indicated he knew nothing about larry O'Brien, Tony Fatsis, or Jack

Cleveland. Similarly he has no recollection of ever having met Bebe Rebozo, and

knows of the person only through newspaper articles.

He remembers that this grand jury was

convened sometime in the summer of 1970 and

that his appearance took place before he went to jail, which was January 25, 1971.

He has no recollection of lavia Nissen, the prosecutor, ever having made & comment

about Maheu; nor did he question Roselll about his recollection of his involvement

with Maheu In the Cuban undertaking:

Roselli had very bad words about Nissen and

mentioned that Nissen had once filed with Judge Gray an unsigned and undated state-

ment discussing Roselll's background, which Roselll, and Wadden both said was very

that Maheu's appearance was well noted in the paper, he said he may have read about

He said he has no recollection or knowledge of Bob Maheu ever making an

application on Roselli's behalf for reduction of sentence.

With regard to political contributions, he has never had any discussions

with Rebozo, or had any conversations with anyone about any contributions (of over

$10,000) to a Presidential campaign. He has no recollection of the Teamsters making

any substantial contributions to the Presidential Campaign. Similarly he has no

knowledge of ferry Thomas making any contribution.

Rosselli has no recollection of ever discussing with Maheu any of

Maheu's problems or contacts with the Administration. Specifically, he does

not recall Maheu ever talking about Stans or any involvements Stans may have

bad with Thonas or Greenspun.

He knew nothing about any use of stolen stocks.

With regard to Jim Crosby, Jack Davis and Mary Carter Paoint Co. he

He had no knowledge of Bob Peliquin or Intertel's Involvement at

With regard to Hank Greenspun, Roselll has known him since the 50's.

The last time he met Greenspun was when he ran into Greenspun in Los Angeles shortly

after he got out of prison, at which time they talked a few minutes. No questions

were asked and there was no discussion with Greenspun about his Involvement with

Maheu. He noted that Greenspun has never questioned him about any matters.

He noted that he has never met Gordon Liddy, Howard funt of any of the

Cuban Americans who were involved in the Watergate break-in.

He said however that

he has been Liddy once, and that was at Terninal Island when he was acting as &

prison librarian.

There were no discussions with Liddy. He 1s fairly certain he

has never. net Hunt with regard to any CIA involvement of his own. He also noted

that he has never had any property or business dealings in Cuba.

The interview concluded with the serving of a subpoens upon Mr. Rosell

With regard to Bob Maheu, he met Maheu for the first time In the mid-50's

in either

Washington or Callfornia

through & mutual acquaintance, Hernan Spitzel.

When questions were asked as to what his subsequent involvement with Maheu was,

Roselll's attorney Instructed him not to answer any questions on the ground of

national security.

Roselli did however indicate how he and Maheu had made arrangements for

Hughes to live at the Desert Inn when Hughes first arrived there in late 1966.

Re

said that he had received a call from Maheu, who needed to make arrangements for

Hughes to move to las Vegas from Boston.

According to Maheu, no one wanted to give

Hughes any rooms. Roselli at the request of Maheu left his residence in Los Angeles

and went up to las Vegas and asked his acquaintance Ruby Kolod, who owned 13% of

the Desert Inn, to accommodate Hughes and allow him to take two of the penthouses

at the Desert Inn. At the time Maheu was in charge of security and responsible for

seeing that Hughes arrived unnoticed in Las Vegas.

Kolod acquiesced and tola

Rosellf that the top floor of the Desert Inn would be available at the

going rate,

but that they would have to leave the hotel by New Years.. When the New Years date

was approaching, Maheu called and said that they had received notice from Kolod and

were suppose to leave their premises.

Roselll then convinced Kolod to allow

them

to stay.

At the same time he told Maheu that Flughes should buy the Hotels.

any problems.

Maheu responded that he was

want to get Involved in any of the gambling businesses and would not therefore want

to purchase the hotel. It was at this point that Roselli conceived of the idea of

trying to sell the hotel, and approached Kolod and asked if he would be willing to

sell it. Kolod replied that if Roselli could make arrangements to sell it he would

receive a finder's fee. Roselli then turned around and-asked Maheu if he wanted to

purchase it. Maheu responded that he would and Rosell turned the matter over to

his attorney. Ed Morgan who then handled the matter until the end.

Rosellf a150

represented his finder's fee for the sale of both the Desert Inn and the Sands:

Roselli noted that while Moe Dalitz was the owner of the Desert Inn, he:

did not negotiate with him because he lound him less agreeable than Kolod. He said

that he had some minor dealings with Dalitz but none of them related to matters

concerning the las Vegas hotel Industry.

With regard to Ed Morgan, Roselli met him in the middle 50's.

Since that

time Morgan has represented him in different Las Vegas Interests. He noted that

Morgan did not represent him in his Friars' Club defense (but did arrange for Jim

cantillion, a Los Angeles attorney to handle the matter). He said that he had no

trouble with Morgan's handling of the Desert Inn finder's fee, since he trusted

Morgan Implicity.

He noted that Morgan had arranged for John

Roselli to be represent

by Tom Wadden, his present attorney. This representation first began on the appeal

from the Friar's Club.

Rosell1 Indicated that his only present interest in Las Vegas concerns

his boldings in the gift shop at the Frontier hotel. His involvement there started

in 196T when he had an arrangement with Mr. Friedman. This set-up did not work out

and Roselli resigned as President of the gift shop.

Thereafter he made an arrange -

ment with & Mr. Breen whereby he would furnish Breen with money and indemnify him

against any losses if Breen would run the gift shop.. This arrangement has worked

out fairly well and he continues to receive his share of the profits each year from

the gift shop.

He mentioned that it was his opinion that Breen had been poorly

treated by the Hughes enterprises, since Hughes first purchased the Frontier.

He

recalls, at his last meeting with Maheu, asking Maheu to lend Breen $60,000 for the

gift shop. Maheu said he would get back to him but never did.

Ultimately a loan

was arranged through Perry Thomas at the Valley Bank of Nevada.

Since 1967 Roselll has seen Maheu only once. And while he does not recall

the date of that meeting he remembers that it was in Los Angeles before Maheu had

terminated with Fughes.

He recalls that Maheu was in Los Angeles at the time while

his wife was having a foot operation, and that he called Roselll to have supper.

Roselll has no recollection of the conversation that the two had at supper other

than that they discussed, as noted above, the possibility of arranging a loan for

Breen at the Frontier Hotel Gift Shop.

He said he has known Peter Maheu since the middle 1950's and that he went

to Peter's wedding reception. His only involvement with Peter occurred whenever

Robert Maheu wanted a message conveyed to Roselli. He recalls no subsequent substantiu

discussions with Peter Maheu..

He Indicated he knew nothing about Larry O'Brien, Tony Hatsis, or Jack

Cleveland. Similarly he has no recollection of ever having met

Bebe Rebozo, and

knows of the person only through newspaper articles.

With regard to his appearance before the Frontier Hotel grand jury in

He remembers that this grand jury was convened sometime In the summer of 1970 and

that his appearance took place before he went to jail, which was Jamary 25, 1971.

He has no recollection of Tavia Nissen, the prosecutor, ever having made a comment

about Maheu; nor did he question Rosellf about his recollection of his involvement

with Maheu in the Cuban undertaking.

Roselll had very bad words about Nissen and

mentioned that Nissen had once filed with Judge Gray an unsigned and undated state-

ment discussing Roselll's background, which Roselll, and Wadden both said

was very

Inaccurate.

Rosell1 has no

recollection of being asked to be an informer by Nissen.

Hedoes remember, however, being approached by two FBI agents in 1966 about the.

possibility of being an informer.

This possibility is discussed in the court files.

Rosselli has no recollection of ever discussing with Maheu any of

Specifically, he does

recall Maheu ever talking about Stans or any involvements Stans may have

had with Thomas or Greenspun.

He knew nothing about any use of stolen stocks.

With regard to Jim Crosby, Jack Davis and Mary Carter Paoint Co. he

knew nothing. Similarly he knew nothing about Jim Golden.

He had no knowledge of Bob Peliquin or Intertel's Involvement at

Wadden chined in by noting that he had been an old associate

of Hundley and had gone to Paradise Island with Hundley about 7 years ago to

look at the Paradise Island set-up.

Rosellf has never talked with or met Jack Caulfield.

Nor does he

recall ever having any private individuals interview him while he was in jail.

He recalls however, that three officers from the Immigration Department once vis-

Ited him and told him about the detainer that was being held on him. Similarly,

while he was in jail, the IRS interviewed him in los Angeles about the finder's

Pee he received in the Frontier Hotel.

The investigation may have related somewhat

about Maheu concerned.

to Maheu, but, since It was so short, he does not recall what the discussion

noted that no one has ever asked him about Danner,

Rebozo or any members

of the Administration.

With regard to Hank Greenspun, Roselll has known him since the 50's.

The last time he met Greenspun was when

he ran into Greenspun in Los Angeles shortly

after he got out of prison, at which time they talked a few minutes. No questions

were asked and there was no discussion with Greenspun about his involvement with

Maheu. He noted that Greenspun has never questioned him about any matters.

He noted that he has never net Gordon Liddy, Howard Funt of any of the

Cuban Americans who were involved in the Watergate break-in. He said however that

he has been Liddy once, and that was at Terminal Island when he was acting as a

prison librarian. There were no discussions with Liddy. He is fairly certain he

has never met Hunt with regard to any. CIA Involvement of his own.

He also noted

that he has never had any property or business dealings in Cuba.

The interview concluded with the serving of a subpoena upon Mr. Rosell

and the decision to hold a further meeting under oath at a later date.

MEMORANDUM

John Rosselli is actually Filippo Sacco, born July 4, 1905,

in Italy of parents Vincenzo and Maria Sacco. Vincenzo Sacco

came to the United States after the birth of Filippo, his oldest

child, and in 1911, Mrs. Sacco and Filippo joined Vincenzo in

the United States where they resided as aliens in East Boston.

Filippo Sacco completed the sixth grade in the public

schools of East Boston and was discharged from school in 1917.

By this time Filippo had two younger brothers and two younger

sisters. In 1918, Vincenzo Sacco died. His wife Maria and the

five children moved into the residence of Liberato Clanciulli

and a daughter was born in 1920. In 1922, Maria and Clanciulli

were married.

In 1922, Filippo had a job driving a horse-drawn milk

wagon and was nicknamed "Milky". However, in addition to his

legitimate occupation, Filippo had made connections with the

criminal element in East Boston and was engaged inarcotic

traffic with his headquarters in and around Maverick Square.

On September 14, 1922, Filippo sold morphine to a government

informant named Fisher while under surveillance by a narcotic

agent. On September 19, 1922, Filippo arranged for a large

sale from his "source" and was present and under agent sur-

veillance when the morphine was delivered. On September 29,

1922, Filippo Sacco and his "source" were arrested by Federal

narcotics agents. On October 18, 1922, the Federal Grand Jury

in Boston indicted Sacco for the sale of narcotic drugs and

two days later he was

released on bail. While awaiting trial

in the narcotics case, in Federal Court, Sacco was arrested and

Indicted in Massachusetts State Court for grand larceny and

was released on bail on July 2, 1923.

In 1923, while he was on bail awaiting trial in the

narcotics and larceny cases, Filippo Sacco jumped bail in both

cases and disappeared from East Boston. The Government narcotics

informant, Fisher, disappeared about the same time and Government

sources believe that he may have

been killed to prevent him fron

testifying Because of his fugitive status, both indictments

against Sacco were dropped.

After Sacco's flight from his home in 1923, he spent some

time in New York and Chicago, and finally made his appearance in

Los Angeles in 1924 under the fictitious name "John Roselli."

Sources indicate that Sacco engaged in bootlegging and hijacking

during this period and police records show he was frequently

arrested on such charges as carrying concealed weapons, and sus-

picion of robbery.

After 1930, Sacco became associated with the Al Capone

gang in Chicago and was also closely associated with organized

crime in Los Angeles. Reliable sources relate that he was an

executioner for the criminal organizations in both cities. In

1936, by demands and threats, Sacco forced his way into part

ownership of "Nationwide News Service," a horseracing information

service used by bookmakers across the country.

After prohibition was repealed, Sacco left the bootlegging

business and associated himself with Columbia Picture Studios.

As a close friend of Los Angeles underworld leader Jack Dragna,

Sacco soon became known as a labor muscleman and racketeer for

the movie studios. In 1943, Sacco was indicted on a charge of

conspiracy to extort millions of dollars from movie producers

and a labor union. Also indicted

were union officials Browne

and Bioff, and the following ranking members of the Chicago La

Cosa Nostra family: Frank Nitto (aka Nitti), Louis Campagna,

Paul DeLucia (aka Paul "the waiter" Ricia), Phil D'Andrea,

Francis Manitote (aka Frank Diamond), and Charles "Cherry Nose"

Gioe. In 1944, Sacco and the Chicago defendants were convicted

and all were sentenced to ten years in prison.

In 1947, Sacco and all his co-defendants were paroled

immediately upon their becoming eligible therefor.

There were

indications that their release had been secured by bribery but

admissible evidence sufficient for prosecution was not obtained.

In July 1948, Sacco's parole was revoked because of his con-

tinued association with known criminals and he was imprisoned

until Hovember 1948, when his parole was reinstated. Shortly

after Sacco's parole terminated in March 1954, William Bioff, a

key Goverment witness at the extortion trial was murdered by

the bombing of his vehicle. (The trial judge reportedly had

warned the defendants that if anything happened to Bioff while

they were on parole he would hold them responsible.) Two other

co-defendants of Sacco have also been victims of gang slayings.

Upon his release from prison, Sacco returned to Los Angeles

and again associated himself with a movie studio." Reliable

sources report that this was a front and in fact, through his

close association with Sam Giancana of Chicago, Sacco received

the responsibility of overseeing the concealed interests in

Las Vegas casinos of the Chicago underworld. Sacco lumediately

became a powerful figure in Las Vegas. He travels back and

forth between Las Vegas and Los Angeles extensively and asso-

ciates with the known Cosa Nostra members and major gamblers.

Rosselli appeared before the Kefauver Coumittee investi-

gating organized crime and falsely testified concerning his

association with underworld figures and even his own personal

background.

During the period 1956-1958, Sacco was very active in

the construction and pre-opening operation of the Tropicana Hotel,

and Sacco received the lease to operate the gift shop. The

Nevada Gaming Control Board refused to allow the Tropicana to

open as long as Sacco was associated with its operation, where-

upon the hotel owners were forced to buy back the gift shop lease

at a cost of $180,000, reportedly about thirty times the amount

paid for the lease.

During the above period, Sacco also involved himself in the

production of shows for the Tropicana, but again the Gaming

Control Board refused to allow him to participate in any capacity

and he sold his interest.

Following his ouster from the

Tropicana, Sacco sold Ice machines to most of the Las Vegas hotels:

at prices far in excess of prices on the open market..

Sacco has

also received numerous "finders fees" from various Las Vegas

hotels and casinos for which few if any services were performed.

• In October 1960, Sacco and T. W. Richardson were involved

in placing a wire tap on the telephone of comedian Dan Rowan in

Las Vegas at the request of Chicago gangster Sam Giancana.:

In May 1968, Sacco was convicted of failing to register as

an alien and report his address annually. In the course of that

trial, it was show that birth records in Chicago, Illinois, had

been forged in an effort to make it appear that Sacco had been

born there as John Rosselli. Sacco has long been a close friend

of Edward J. Barrett, County Clerk, Cook County, Illinois, in

whose office the birth records for Chicago were kept.

Among Sacco's underworld associates are the following:

Al Capone - head of the Chicago underworld gang;

Charles F. Fischetti - a Capone lieutenant;

Micky Cohen - gambler and racketeer;

Jack Dragna - leader of the Cosa Nostra, Los Angeles,

now deceased;

Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel - member of Murder, Inc.,

murdered June 20, 1947;

Numerous prospective witnesses in the course of investiga-

tions concerning Sacco's criminal activities have expressed or

displayed fear at the prospect of being called to testify

against him, and a number of witnesses have refused to testify.

In the Friars Club trial, It was apparent that a number of

witnesses deliberately perjured themselves in order to exonerate

Sacco, Including Friedman, Vinnie Donato, Lee Deer, and Nat Ross.

Defendant Sacco was convicted in the Friars Club case in

December 1968 of interstate travel in aid of a racketeering

enterprise and interstate transportation of fraudulently obtained

securities.

He was also convicted of making a false statement in

his income tax return. Sacco has had a long practice of concealing

the source and nature of his income. He was sentenced to five years

in prison.

In view of Sacco's extensive criminal record extending back

more than 40 years, as well as his membership and participation

in the organized criminal syndicate known as Cosa Nostra, we

strongly urge that defendant Sacco's sentence not be reduced for

any reason whatsoever. He is a genuine menace to society and,

in particular, to those witnesses who have testified against him.

To: Terry Lenzner

From: Jim Moore

Subject: Robert Maheu - John Roselli -

Hereis a summary of what I have done on the Roselli- Maheu

HH 54923

connection.

Yesterday I spoke with David Nissen, who prosecuted Roselli in

1968 for being an unregistered alien and for being involved with hidden

owners in the Friar's Club case. Nissen never met Maheu or spoke with

241029

him. However, he did remember that stories about Maheu and Roselli

being involved in anti-Castro plots did come to his attention when he was

investigating and prosecuting Roselli. He couldn't remember the source

of those stories, saying that his information came from many people,

including Justice Department lawyers in Washington and the FBI. One

story he heard was that Maheu tried to intervene in Washington, either

through direct contacts in the FBI or at Justice or through Edward P.

Morgan, to kill the Roselli prosecution on the basis that Roselli had helped

the United States in Cuba. Maheu was reportedly an old CIA agent, • Nissen

remembers hearing at some point that Roselli had gone to Cuba in an attempt

to assasinate Castro •

Nissen said that there are extensive files on Roselli maintained by

the FBI or the Department. Nissen had a vague recollection that the files

contained a story about Maheu somehow being involved in a wiretap on Sam

Giancona, for whom Roselli worked. Nissen also remembered information

about a meeting between Maheu and Giancona regarding. Cuba, but he couldn't

remember any of the specifics.

When Roselli came up for sentencing, he was represented by Tom

Wadden, who had been associated in some capacity with Edward Bennett

Williams. Wadden filed a motion to reduce sentence and included with it

two col lumns by Jack Anderson that recounted the story of Roselli and Maheu

trying to assasinate Castro. Nissen thought the motion might also have

included an affidavit from Edward P. Morgan.

The government successfully

resisted the motion on the grounds of fraud, since Wadden produced no

witnesses or documentation to support his claim. I called the Federal Court

in Los Angeles, and they have seat the motion for reduction of sentence and

attached papers to us.

The Clerk there told me that in addition to the Anderson

F. 284

columns, the motion included affidavits from Anderson and Les: Whitten

vouching for the unnamed source of the columns.:

Roselli is now in Florida so he can be reached, but, according to

Nissen, Giancona is in exile somewhere in Mexico.

FRONTIER CASE

Nissen never heard about Maheu being questioned in Washington in

Frontier

lieu of the Grand Jury appearance.

Nissen did not try the/case, because he

had been promoted to supervisory capacity. However, he seemed surprised

that he had never heard of such a meeting. He gave me the names of

three lawyers who handled the case after he gave up direct responsibility.

for it. My phone interview with the first of them, Jerry Ullman, is written

up as a separate interview. The second Lawyer, John Hornbeck, has not

yet returned my phone call.

The third, Tom Kotoski,actually tried the case.

He is now an assistant United States Attorney in Los Angeles and about to

become head of the San Francisco Strike Force. He will be in Washington

Thursday and Friday, February 14 and 15, and I have asked him to call me

as sonn as possible.

MEMORANDUM

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL

To::

Senator Ervin

From:

Terry Lenzner and Marc Lackritz

Subject: Relevance to S. Res. 60 of John Rosselli's :

testimony about his CIA activities

:..=

Summary:

John Rosselli and his attorney, Tom Wadden, object to

testifying about Rosselli's involvement with Robert Maheu in a :

CIA-financed plot to assassinate Fidel Castro in the early 1960's .

The objection is based upon national security grounds as well as

an assertion by Mr. Wadden that the material is not relevant to

our inquiry under S. Res. 60.

Testimony of Mr. Rosselli about this matter is relevant

and necessary to our investigation for a variety of reasons.

Facts: -

angel Wheator!

During the last year of the Eisenhower Administration, the

CIA apparently financed and organized a plot to assassinate Fidel

Castro. Among the participants in this plot were Robert Maheu and

John Rosselll. Maheu had a public relations business at the time,.

and Rosselli was associated with some alleged organized crime

figures (e.g. Sam Giancana) who had lost substantial gambling

investments when Castro came to power. Apparently, the plot

continued into the early 1960's even after the abortive Bay of Pigs

invasion, but it failed in attaining its objective of killing Castro.

Only a few officials in the government knew of the exis-

tence of the plot at that time.

Justice Department officials stumbled across this infor-

mation about the plot as a result of their investigation into an

illegal wiretap by Sam Giancana in the early 1960's.

not tó compromise national security considerations.

4119218.

The information about the alleged assassination plot then

lay dormant in a secret file in the Department of Justice until early

1969; when Assistant Attorney General Will Wilson requested the

file from the Deputy Chief of the Organized Crime Section. The file

was returned to Central Files shortly after t was taken out. ente

" "AsSistant Attomey General Wilson next requested the secret

Justice file in early 1971 in Connection with his interview of Robert

Maheu on January 27, 1971 (see attached chronology). This interview

at the Department of Justice, in lieu of a grand jury appearance, was

arranged by a telephone call to Attorney General Mitchell on January 19,

1971, only one day after Jack Anderson published his first column linking

both Maheu and Rosselli to the CIA plot to kill Castro. (see attached)

...

However, the significance of Anderson's column on January 18,

1971, was that on the same day, Haldeman requested Dean to find out

what he could about the Hughes - Maheu - O'Brien relationship.

In the follow-up memos from Caulfield to Dean on the Maheu-

O'Brien link, Caulfield notes Maheu's prior "covert activities" for the

CIA and advises Dean that a check into CIA, FBI, and IRS files on Robert

Maheu is advisable to avoid a "counter-scandal."

In addition, Assistant Attorney General Wilson showed the

sensitive "Castro file" to Attorney General Mitchell, in January, 1971,

and discussed with him the political implications of the information.

Following the on-the-record interview of Maheu on January 27, 1971,

by Lynch, Wilson and Petersen, Maheu was interviewed privately by

Wilson concerning his prior CIA activities with John Rossell. Maheu

was not forthcoming with information about the plot at that time.

Attorney General Mitchell discussed the contents of the sensitive file

with President Nixon, according to Wilson, who had advised him to do

sO.

Conclusion:

Therefore, the obsession of the Administration in keeping tabs

on Larry O'Brien in 1971 and 1972 was in part motivated by a fear that

Maheu would impart some of this sensitive information about the plot

HH

to O'Brien. Alternatively the objective was to discover if there was

any information about the plot that might be damaging to the Democrats

that O'Brien might possess

from Maheu. And these concerns could

have been a possible motivation for the break-in to the offices of the

DNC and Larry O'Brien by four Cuban-Americans on June 17, 1972,

especially since their directions were to photograph any documents

relating to Cuban contributions or Cuban involvement in the 1972 •

Democratic campaign.

It is for these reasons that we wish to question John Rossellitor:

about the nature and scope of his activities. "

LESLIE WHITTEN, being duly sworn, deposes and says the

following:

1. I am employed as principal associate of nationally-

syndicated columnist Jack Anderson, writer of "Washington Merry-

2. I worked on certain articles relating to John

Rosselli, and services performed by him on behalf of the Central

Intelligence Agency, an organ of the United States Federal GoV-

ernment.

3. As part of my investigation, I twice called William

R. Harvey, a retired Central Intelligence Agency official, now of

Indianapolis.

4. On my first call, in January, I asked Harvey if it

were not true that he had personally intervened with the Justice

Department in order to mitigate the government's prosecution of

Rosselli on the basis that Rosselli had done a 'formidable service

for his country. Harvey said "this is a long story... I don't

think it ought to be printed." I asked him whether it was not

true that he had

a high regard for Rosselli. "I still do," he

earnestly replied.

5. In pursuing the story further, I called Harvey

again in Indianapolis in February and asked him whether he could

\

comment on our story about Rosselli which by now has been pub-

lished widely in the United States. He declined to comment. "But

he twice reaffirmed his "high regard" for Rosselli. I advised

him I was making an affidavit on Rosselli's behalf. and he ex-

pressed concern for Rosselli, asked his present status and said

he would "follow up" on Rosselli's behalf from his end.

6. Based on my part of the investigation, I am satis-
