SUBJECT:

LA COSA NOSTRA

AR - CONSPIRACY

4-

At 2:25 a.m., 1-23-65, the Los Angeles Office called

to report that LA-4448-C-TE, a valuable top echelon

informant,

and a veteran member of the

Los Angeles "family"' of La Cosa Nostra,

had just learned that Frank Desimone, boss of Los Angeles "family,"

had departed Los Angeles

area for Miami probably via airlines on le

Wednesday, 1-20-65.

Desimone will meet

with the "Commission"

in Miami on January 25, 1965, rather than in New York as originally

planned.

This change was made due to the publicity and "heat"

generated by recent appearance of other La Cosa Nostra members

before Federal Grand

York, which is holding hearings

regarding disappearance of Joe Bonanno.

ACTION:

The New York and Miami Offices were advised of above

change in plans.

Miami instructed to afford this matter top

priority, attempt to locate Desimone, and effect discreet

coverage.
