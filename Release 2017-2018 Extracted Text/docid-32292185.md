DETAILS:

RAUL, MORAN, a plastering contractor residing at

1610 28th Averue,

Florida, on April 10, 1961, advised

SA RICHARD S.

Orlando, Florida, for about five years. He advised that

NAVIA and his family formerly lived near them in Tampa and

they were good friends and in fact, godparents of NAVIA'S

children.

Furthermore NAVIA once worked for him for a

few weeks.

MORAN advised that he himself was formerly head

of the ANTI-COMMUNIST COLMITTEE TO AID THE CUBAN LIBERATION

and presently is associated with the AGRUPACION MONTECRISTI,

an affiliate of the FRENTE REVOLUTIONARIO DEMOCRATICO,

dedicated to the overthrow of FIDEL CASTRO and Communism

in Cuba. He advised that to his knowledge NAVIA was never

a member of these or any other Cuban revolutionary groups

and never took part in any such activities.

At one time MORAN and others of the ANTI-

COMMUNIST COMMITTEE traveled to Orlando to see NAVIA and

others about organizing a group there, but nothing ever came

Furthermore he left some MONTECRISTI

literature, including applications blanks, with NAVIA re-

NAVIA expressed interest in associating himself

with this group, but has taken no formal action in this

regard either.

MORAN stated that NAVIA has always expressed himself

as being opposed to FIDEL CASTRO. He recalled that even

back when CASTRO was fighting in the hills in Cuba, NAVIA

said that CASTRO would be even a worse dictator than BATISTA.

On May 16, 1961, T-1 advised that NESTOR NAVIA
