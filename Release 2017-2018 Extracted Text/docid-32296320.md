A request for similar coverage on FORMUSA's activities

is being withheld at this time pending his recovery and release from

a Chicago hospital.

A request for coverage by highly confidential sources

bond in a local bribery case, and in addition, under deportation

orders from the Immigration

and Naturalization Service.
