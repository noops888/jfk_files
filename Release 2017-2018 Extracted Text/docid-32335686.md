ber of men to receive military training, and the length

of time necessary to train these men.

Hemming volunteered

to establish and run the training camp, and agreed with

Prio that he, Hemming, would be in charge of the camp.

Prio stated he would be ready in about fifteen or twenty

days to confer with Hemning again concerning this training

camp and to hear Hemming's ideas on specific operations

that could be carried out at such a camp. Prio said he

would give Hemming $100.00 to pay Hemming's room rent.

On July 11, 1963, MM T-1 advised that Hemming

left Miami, Florida, on July 3, 1963, and arrived the fol-

lowing day at Dallas, Texas, where he conferred with Irwin

A. Walker, former General, U. So Army, the well-known segre-

gationist. Walker told Hemming he did not want to participate

in Cuban affairs because he does not want to back any specific

cause, but rather, be readily available to fight Commnism

After these two Individuals return

obtain.

visit Miami, Florida, and set up an intelligence-gathering

office In Miami, send a man to handle the funds, and would

see people about donating boats to Hemming's anti-Castro

movement in Miami.

are more ambitious than Hemming's ability
