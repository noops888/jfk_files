ADMINISTRATIVE :

Mr. ALTON BRYANT furnished information reported

in this report from the records of General Telephone Company

of Florida,

Tampa, Florida, and

requested his identity be

protected.

A careful review of this file reflects that investi-

gation to date has failed to develop information indicating

any current criminal activity on the part of subject.

He

does have associates

who are involved in gambling and boxing

and on the fringe of the criminal element.

It is not believed,

however, that this subject is of sufficient statuRe to warrant

continued investigation under the criminal intelligence pro-

gram and after he is interviewed, it is anticipated that this

case will be closed.
