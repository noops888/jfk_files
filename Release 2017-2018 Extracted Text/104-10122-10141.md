SUBJECT: Robert A. Mahou

VI. Robert A. Maheu vas born on 30 October 1917 in

Haterville, Maine.

He graduated from Holy Cross College in 1940

and is married with four children.

Ho was employed as

Speciel Agent with the FBI from 1940 to 1947, and upon re-

•Signing from the Bureau, formed a private enterprise doing

business as "Dairy Dream Products."

This venture culminated

in bankruptcy in 1952. He then re-entered Government service

with the Small Business Adninistration in Washington, D. C.,

and was appointed Special Assistant to the Administrator with

the specific duty of Director of Security. In February of

1954, he was forced to resign fron SBA because of political

reasons, determined to be the result of backing the wrong

political party in the election. He then set up his own

investigative organization known as Robert A. Mahou Associates.

Mr. lianeu was recruited by the Office of Security in

March of 1954. He was previously known to bir. Robert i.

Gunningham (deceased) who was, at that tine, Chief, Special

Security Division, through their mutual employaent by the

FBI.

Cunninghan saw in Mahes a covert asset who could be

utilized by the Office in extremely sensitive cases. with

the approval of the Director of security, Subject was offered

a proposition whereia he was to receive $500.00 per month,

with the stipulation that he nove into his own office and

that he he on call for any assignments by the Office of

security.

He agreed to this and innodiately took steps to

move out of his area, where he rented desk space in a suite

occupied by Carnine S. Bellino, a former FBI agent and CPA.

In July of 1954, Maheu was engaged by 'British shipping

interests" to check on Aristotle Onassis' activities while

in the linited States.

This included technical coverage of

Onassis' New York office. It was later leared that the

principal "British interest" was Stavros Niarchus and that

goal of this task was to scrap the Onassis/

Mahes took the job but conditioned his

acceptance with the fact that he would do nothing ininical

to the U. S. Government.

Any information developed of interest

to the United States was to be passed by liaheu to the appro-

priate fovernment azcacy.

During this operation Maheu had his staff prepare a

paper citing dangers to U.S. economy and trade resulting

fron the Onassis deal. Through contacts in FOA, Maheu

had Harold Stassen read this paper in the National Security

Council on 22 June 1954. During this same perica Maheu

briefed Scott McLeod, Assistant Secretary of State for

Security and Consular Affairs on the project.

Melsod

agreed to furnish State commo and pouch facilities subject

to John Foster Dulles' approval. Additionally, Maneu

briefed J. Edgar Hoover and Vice President Nixon.

August of 1954, Maneu advised this Office of his rela-

tionship with Niarchus.

NEA Division was contacted and

expressed interest in this matter. They were put in touco

ind operational guidance.

as a result of the Onassis Niarchus natter, and as a resull

of Niarchus claining Governent privilege in the case, the

Agoncy was subsequently identified as being the Government

agency involved.

Files of this Office reflect extensive

correspondence furnished us by the Office of General Counsel

in 1956 regarding the Onassis matter.

On 16 August 1954 Subject was granted a covert security.

clearance for utilization as an agent under Project

in the Near East.

On 30 August 1954 he vas granted a sinilar

clearance to permit his use in the United States as a covert

associate under Proiect IPHIDDEN. In November of 1957, a

cable from

allegedly been involved in a violation of tho vare Act in

procuring and transporting prostitutes for

during

visit to the United States in 1930.

No. Maneu contacted this Office to advise that the allegations

were without foundation and stated that he would take steps

immediately to have his attorney see that appropriate

officials would retract the charges.

This was

subsequently done.

Edward Bennett Willians acted as Maheu's

Lawyer

In this matter.

In 1957 information was received indicating that during

President Sukarno's visit to Moscow in the fall of 1956, he was

introduced to a Soviet woman within the Krenlin. He had

an affair with

her against the admonitions of his advisers.

It was reported

that the Soviets

took detailed filns of the

affair and that a copy was sent to the PKI. In June of 1957

Al Ulmer and Samuel Halpern, FE Division, contacted the

envisioned a filn being made simulating this affair. It

was Dlanned that clips

fron this filn would be inserted in

a leaflet for distribution throughout Southeast Asia sug-

gesting that Sukarno was compronised by the Soviets. In

July of 1957, Robert Maheu was given this assignnent. He

utilized a trusted male employee of this organization (since

deceased) and his fiance.

Maheu after an intensive nake-up

course, adninistered the nase-up to the participants himsell,

utilizing available pictures and descriptions of the sujects

as a guide. He hired a studio where he was given detailed

instruction on the use of the lights and canera.

iren the

film was taken, only Haheu and the two participants were in

the studio.

The project known as "Happy Days," Has never

completed and the film was not distributed..
