It was advised orally that the Bureau was using KAMKIN

the "Anchor Printing Shop" in which the "North China Marine"

cortisued publiostion in Tsingtao, China. The KAMKINs came to

the Undted States in 1949 arriving in San Francisco in Karcho

As of 1957 KAMKIN was being used on an unclassified basis by

the CIA Llbrary asa publications procurement channel. It la, of

course, possible that Subjeot's Interest in "RODINA" is on behalf

of this agency®

The other book stores involved In the report to the French

Desk were the well known Communist "Four Continents Book Store,

(MS-2000), "'Imported Publications and Products" (MS-2001-I) and

registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The Four

open a branch book store in San Francisco to be operated by Se

SAPFIKIN. The store was to be called Znanio,.

DAVIDOr, was the subject of an FBI Record Check Roguest In May

1955• (The wife Nina, per the check sheet, resided at houte

An'ONI name chock on KAMKIN, 11 November 1954, reflected the

the IRO Camp at Samar, P. I. As reported above, Mrs, KAMKIN'

sister Nine and her husband Semen SAPELKIN were evacunted to Semar,

P. I., from Shanghai under IRD auspices in April 1919.

Ventanin Vasilievitch SAPHLKIN's friend ORIOFF, according to

a report of 8 April 1950, was alleged to have influenced a district

loader of the IRO Canp at Samar with pro-Soviet propaganda, and to

have worked with a number of other pro-sovist internees in the camp

to Sovietize the Russian refugees interned there.

According to a

report dated 5 May 1950, ORLOFF allegedly was believed to be a

Soviet agent. (The report noted that this information originated

In the IRO Camp in Sanar; that nuch Information originating there

had proven unrellable; and that the reliability of this particular

Inforation had not been deterudned.)

However this may be, it appears that there could be much truth

in the allogations. Information In Security files roflects that

ORIOFF very possibly 18 identioal with a "Count ORIOFF of the

Pussian Committee", (apparently a connitted of 1ho), no assisted

the Commercial Counselor for the Bulgarian Legation in securing

IRO employment for pne Bogdana OTTAI, a poseible Soviet agent in

Paris who was Ilving with and was engaged to narry Kir1l VASSILEV,

who was belleved to be an agent of the Bulgarian Military Intelligence

Service•

"Count ORIOFF" also helped arrange OTTAl'a entrance into

the United States.

Alexander S. ORIOF and "Count ORIOFF" may well

be identical with Alexander ORIOFF, DI-2881, a highly suspect

Individaal of Pussian birth, and a former AtTORG employee who was

security disapproved by OSS in 1943. This latter individual, per

a 1943 OSS Investigation, was known as "The Count",

A December 195L Staff C memorandum regarding KAMKIN, reported

that unevaluated Information dated 1 June 1948 indicated that one

Victor N. KAMKIN was Involved in a money printing transaction with

the Japanese; in which he used the machinery of the Chihli Preas

In Tientsin to facilitate the counterfitting. The source of this

Information had pointed out the possibility that Victor No KAMKIN

might be identified in some way with a V. P. KAMKIN who was named

as a character reference by one Vladimir Vasily IVASHKOFF. (IVASHKOFF

was not identified.) The memorandum advised that according to a

report dated 1 June 1948 frcm a U. S, Naval Attache, Nanking, to

the American Ambassador, Nanking, V. N. KAMKIN was a printer and

publisher in Shanghai and later was in charge of the Russian

Publishing House/ known as Nashe ZNANIE. He was closely associated

with Bernard S. HOGARD of the chihli Press, who in turn was

associated with alloged Soviet espionage agent Olga NAKVASIN®

According to the Staff C memorandum, a report from the FBI

dated Il August 1953 indicated that a source of unknown rellability

stated that one Victor KAMKIN, who operated a book store as a

possible cover in Tinntsin, Chin, acted as a paid informer of

the Japanese during World War II; and was a paid informer of la So

Army Intelligence after the War.

With the assistance of the

Amerloan Mlitary Goversment in Isingtao, China, he became Chairman

of the Pussian Immigrant Society in Tsingtao in 1948. There seems

small doubt that this Victor KAMKIN 1s Identical with Victor Ne

KAMKIN, and with Subject, Victor P. KAMKIN who was formerly head

of the Russian Irmigrant Association in Isingtao, China, accord-

1ng to his friend SAPELRIN, as reported in Hong Kong Dispatch

#402. Note that Victor N. KAMKIN was in charge of a Russian

ublishing House In China known as Nashe Zpande; and that th

branch store Sabject intended to open in San Francisco (and mas

hare opened) was also to be called Znardo (this work 12 Fussian

means "Knowledge").
