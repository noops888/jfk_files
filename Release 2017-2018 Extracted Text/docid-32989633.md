On 1/25/75 at the request of Special Counsel

Forty

Intelligence Coordinator Michael Shaheen in the Department;

a meeting was held between representatives of the FBI (SAs

• Paul B: Daly and John Thomas), representatives of the Senate

Select Committee (John I. Elliff, Task Force head of the Domestic

Task Force, Mark Gitenstein) and Michael Shaheen of the Department.

At this meeting Mr. Shaheen advised that the proposed procedures

concerning the handlings of requests for documents by the Senate

Select Committee had been approved by the 'Attorney General and in

the Senate Select Committee.

(A copy is attached.)

Shaheen

and Elliff indicated the purpose in meeting on

the 25th along with an anticipated meeting on Monday, 7/28/75, was

to assist the SSC in the planning of a superseding request in

accordance with the newly established procedures concerning

document requests.

Both Shaheen and Elliff expressed concern at

this time that the schedules set forth in the new agreement was

such that in many instances the Bureau would not be able to

respond in time to meet the deadlines. Additionally, Shaheen

expressed concern that the provisions

require that the Attorney

General adjudicate any question as to the necessity of furnishing

la document to the Committee and to make such a decision within

2

hours would be very burdensome.

Messrs. Elliff and Shaheen were advised by SA Daly that

this would be true, pointing out that in many instances files are

not readily available because of FOlA requests, needs of the

Bureau's ongoing investigations and law suits in which it was

necessary to view particular files.

It was also pointed out that

many of the requests of the Senate Select Committee necessitate

the review of a number of files and/or numerous. volumes of a

particular file all of which are not necessarily available

immediately.

Mr. Shaheen advised that it was the Attorney

General's desire that Senate Select Committee requests take

precedence over all other matters including the Freedom of In-

formation.

It was pointed out to Mr. Shaheen that our responses

to Freedom of Information Act are under deadline by law and;

RE: SENSTUDY 1975

¡this were to be the Attorney General's feelings, he should

advise this Bureau in writing so that we would be in a

position to use this statement of policy should this

question arise during litigation.

Select Committee we have pending FOIA requests and/or

litigation which require the availability of those files

for responses.

Elliff indicated that it was the Committee's desire

in their forthcoming superseding request to request material

that had been previously furnished the Committee with the under-

standing that there would be less excisions made in compliance

with the new agreement:

He inquired as to whether the Bureau

could advise him as to

what material previously furnished was

readily retrievable and could be furnished in accordance with

a new request.

He was advised by SAs Daly and Thomas that it was

not possible at this time to give him a response, however, we would

endeavor to make an

analysis of prior requests to obtain this in-

formation and have it available for the meeting Monday, 7/28/75.

A general discussion was had concerning the new agree-

ment especially concerning the type of material which might

properly be excised and third agency problems. It was generally

agreed upon that not only the identity of informants be excised

but also information which might disclose the Identity of infor-

mants might also be

properly excised." Elliff indicated that the

Committee did not wish

, to see many items referred to the Attorney

General as is called for by the agreement for his decision and

would rather at least on a preliminary basis where it was a

question of the

or one of his representatives before such a

referral was made. Shaheen also indicated a desire that the

referrals to the Attorney General be kept to a minimum.

Regard-

ing the "Third Agency" problems which are not addressed in the

agreement there was no final decision arrived at.

Elliff and

Shaheen

were under the impression that the clauses referring

to foreign intelligence operations or foreign intelligence

would handle this problem.

They were advised that

this was not the case. This was not true since even in

these instances Senators on the Committee are given access

after the Attorney

General has made a determination that

material involved "pecularily sensitive foreign intelli-

gence sources or pecularily sensitive ongoing foreign

a request dated July 28, 1975, captioned "Superseding Request

This document amounted to a recapitulation

of prior requests made by the Committee with a schedule for

Intelligence Division has requested the Administrative Division to

review Sections 10 and 12 (copies attached) of the Manual of Rules and

Regulations for any possible excisions or problems in furnishing this

material to the committee and to furnish the results of the review to Legal.

Counsel, attention Dennis R. Dickson.

Section 10, pertaining to Appeals and Grievances, and Section 12,

Transfers-Resignations, have been reviewed and no problems can be foreseen

and no excisions are necessary. In this regard, it is noted that Part I,

Section 10, Appeals and Grievances, needs to be revised to set forth the

current appeal rights of nonveterans. Attached is memorandum recommending

a Manual revision be approved pointing out that under current procedure,

final action in disciplinary matters involving cases of nonveterans up to and

including dismissal is taken by the Assistant Director, Administrative

Division, with the employee having the right to appeal this action to the

Director.

There was some question under Section 12 dealing with transfers to

foreign assignments wherein it is set out that Chief Clerks should be afforded

training in maintenance, consolidation, and destruction of files, whether this

information should be furnished. This was discussed with Deputy Assistant

Director, Homer R. Hauer, Files and Communications Division, who advised

there is nothing objectionable to this reference regarding destruction of files

and the reference of same need not be excised.

Under Section 12, dealing with foreign assignments, information is

set out regarding people being transferred to such assignments receiving

training on coding equipment, the AFSAM-7. This was questioned as to

whether it should be excised. Alvin C. Frank, Section Chief, Communications

, Section, advised this information need not be excised as the mere reference

to AFSAM coding equipment is not

"Memorandum Burns to Walsh

Re: Senate Select Committee

It should also be noted that certain Manual changes are being

recommended in connection with Section 12, in relation to absences for

maternity purposes. In Section 12, page 10, we are recommending that

the phrase "absence for maternity reasons" be used in all instances where

we have previously used the phrase "maternity leave." These recommended

revisions have already been approved and are being processed. In

Section 12, page 8, we are recommending a revision indicating that

employees resigning for maternity purposes can utilize accrued sick leave

during their period of incapacitation and are not setting out specific time

elements as previously utilized. Memorandum is attached recommending

this change.

RECOMMENDATION:

That this memorandum be furnished to Intelligence Division;

with three copies to Legal Counsel Division, setting forth that the

Administrative Division has no objection to the material set out in

Sections 10 and 12, including proposed revisions, of the Manual of Rules

and Regulations being referred for review..

At the request of the Senate Select Committee

(SSC), we recently furnished to it superseded material dated

back to 1960 and relating to various sections of the Manual

of Instructions, including Section 87. In furnishing this

material, we did not furnish the various cover sheets

relating to the many revisions since 1960.

We have received a telephonic request from

Miss Martha Talley of the SSC Staff for additional infor-

mation which would help her to better understand the various

revisionsto Section 87. She also specifically desired a

copy of page l of that Section as it existed on 1/1/60.

We have secured the various cover sheets for the

many revisions, as well as a copy of page 1 which bears

the revision date of 8/13/56 and which, according to

Mrs. Alene I. Smith of the Iraining Division, was the page 1

in force as of 1/1/60.

In order to comply with the request of Miss Talley,

it is not believed necessary to obtain from the SSC a

formal, written request; neither is it believed necessary

to transmit the requested material by formal correspondence

to the S'SC through the Attorney General.

Director Soc'y

Memorandum outlines problem area with respect to

confidentiality of FBI sources which we have encountered in

the Senate Select Committee (SSC) investigation.

• In their investigation of COINTELPRO, SSC has been

given access to material from which we excised

only informants

and potential informants as defined in Manual of Instructions.

When such material was requested for delivery, we have excised

identities of all individuals to whom we have incurred an

obligation to protect their identity and relationship with the

FBI.

SSC has objected to these more extensive excisions in

delivered material, claiming the agreed-upon procedures do

not allow us such latitude.

This was not our understanding

of the agreement.

As a result of this impasse, on morning of 8/8/75

the Director and other FBI representatives met with the

Attorney General (AG) and the Deputy Attorney General (DAG)

in an attempt to resolve the question. The AG deferred a

decision at that time pending the receipt of certain requested

information concerning the general COINIELPRO operation. Later

that date, Mr. John Elliff, SSC, contacted SAs William O. Gregar

and Elmer W. Larson of the

Senstudy Project, INID, and stated

the DAG had

suggested he attempt to get together with Bureau

epresentatives and reach some sort of

accommodation in this area.

Conomi 59516

During the afternoon of 8/8/75, Messiamites,

Larson and Elliff conferred at length. Mr. Elliff indicated

he felt it was imperative that a certain number of individuals,

Re:

who had cooperated with the FBI in the COINTELPRO operations,

se Interviewed by SSC Representatives so that a more accurate

icture could be obtained concerning possible harm t

COINTELPRO targets. He indicated there was a deadline set

for completion of COINTELPRO phase of SSC investigation and

time did not allow for extensive interviews; however, he

estimated that given no deadline a maximum of 36 such contacts

would be made and, in view of the deadline, 8 to 12 interviews

lof the type indicated to be more realistic. Mr. Elliff isolated

three cases which he suggested might most easily lend themselves

to a compromise on this point and suggested they be considered

by the Bureau. If the Bureau saw fit to agree in these

instances, he suggested further deliberations be made to

select further cases in which the cooperative sources' identities

could be made available to the SSC.

SAs Cregar and Larson emphasized to Elliff that the

principle involved here was not whether or not the cooperative

source was of great and current value to the FBI but that the

issue was the bis obligation to the source to protect the

confidentiality of the relationship While professing to

acknowledge the validity of the Bureau position in this regard,

Elliff, nonetheless, was adamant in his standing that the SSC

be allowed to contact these sources without the FBI first

contacting them to ascertain their amenability to such interview.

It was stressed to Elliff that prior contact of these sources

by the FBI would be mutually advantageous since it would

satisfy FBI obligation to the source and, if the source then

agreed to interview, would provide the S'SC with a forth-coming

cooperative witness. Finally, after much discussion, Elliff

suggested that the three cases presented by him be approved and

following this he would be willing to consider negotiation

concerning further disclosures of identities of sources based

on FBI proposal of prior contact.

The three cases proposed by

Elliff are briefly set out below:

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

1: In 1969, an Assistant State Attorney General,

an established source of the Albuquerque Office, requested

public source information concerning an individual in

New Mexico who was a candidate for appointment to a pollution

commission. We were able to furnish such information reflecting

the

subject's affiliation with the Students for a Democratic

Society. SSC indicated they desire to interview our source.

2. In 1966, we furnished information to a California

State Alcohol Beverage Control Commission agent that liquor

was to be sold at a political fund-raising party. SSC desires

to interview this source.

3. In 1968, the editor of a Tucson, Arizona,

newspaper contacted our resident agency in Tucson and requested

pertinent background data concerning some of the activists in

various anti-draft, anti-Vietnam and similar groups in the

Tucson area who had been receiving considerable publicity of

late. Authority was granted to furnish public source data to

the newspaper man. S'SC now wishes to identify this contact

and interview

him.

On 8/12/75; the Director was advised of the proposal

by Mr. Elliff. The Director indicated he desired to adhere to

the current policy of not divulging identity of sources with

whom the FBI has a confidential relationship; however, he

extended an invitation for Mr. Elliff to meet with him on

8/18/75 at 4:00 p.m., for further discussion of this issue.

During the morning of 8/12/75, the Director's position and

invitation was conveyed to Mr. Elliff by SA Cregar. Shortly

thereafter, Mr. Elliff called

back to advise that he appreciated

the invitation but that in his view the meeting would merely

contribute to further delay and that he planned to contact

This recommends representatives of Special and

General Investigative Divisions review material from

inspection reports which may be requested by the Senate

Select Committee (SSC) to determine whether any excisions

would be necessary before it is made available to the SSC.

By letter dated 5/14/75, the SSC, Appendix B,

Item I, Number 5, requested access to annual inspection

reports and related surveys for the past 10 years with

respect to the Intelligence Division and 10 field offices.

At a conference between members of the SSC Staff and

representatives of the Department of Justice and the FBIHQ

Senstudy staff, 5/30/75, it was agreed that in response to

the above request we would make available to the SSC Staff,

for review at FBIHQ, copies of the reports of the two

inspections conducted of the Domestic Intelligence Division in 1971

and the inspection of the San Francisco Office during

October, 1970.

REC56 62-1163/5-552

These reports- have been revieved by both the

Intelligence and Inspection Divisions and necessary excisions

agreed upon. The SSC Staff is being notified by IHM 7/22/75,

Memorandum to Mr.

Re:

determine that such material is pertinent to its mandate

by making a written request for access to it. The criminal

portions removed are attached to the tickler copies of this

memorandum designated for Messrs. Cleveland and Gallagher,

as they relate to matters within their Divisions' purview.

It has been our experience that the SSC generally does request

to see or obtain material not furnished during responses to

an initial request. Thereforé, it would be prudent for

representatives of the General

and Special Investigative

Divisions

to, at this time, review the material attached to

Messrs. Cleveland and Gallagher's ticklers and make a

determination as to whether any excisions must be made before

review by the SSC Staff, should same be requested.

Generally,

under current ground rules, only material which would identify

sensitive sources, including cooperative foreign agencies,

or violate the Third Agency Rule, may be excised. Inquiries

regarding current ground rules may be made by the Senstudy

representatives of the General and Special Investigative

Divisions of Supervisor J. P. Thomas, Room 4063 JEH,

Extension 4636.

ACTION:

It is recommended that the material attached to

the ticklers of Messrs. Cleveland and Gallagher be reviewed

as indicated above and returned to Mr. Thomas with any

necessary excisions underlined in red by 7/24/75.

7. Agents contacting informants outside of normal working

hours obtained supervisory approval for these contacts

prior to making them and make appropriate notations on

their #3 cards.

Supervisors thereafter, during file

reviews with Agents, check with them regarding those

contacts and spot-check informant files to insure after-

hour contacts were made and appropriately recorded.

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT :

1. The overall objectives of the criminal informant program

are to develop high quality informants who are in a

position to furnish valuable information on a continuing

basis.

Criminal desk supervisors participate in the program by

remaining

alert to the necessity of having good informant

coverage in the criminal classifications which are covered

2 to go in on c

by their respective desks.

The supervisor is also

required to approve any expenditure made to an informant

for information or services concerning

any case

handled on his desk and in this way will be awarr. of the

progress of the progres as it celates to their deik.

The supervisors also follow the Agents' activitic; in

this regara on an individual basis to insure that. they

are fully participating in the informant program.

The San Francisco Office does have standards which

requires all Agents assigned one year or more to this

division should conform to and that is they should have

a minimum of four PCIs or one CI and two PCIs or two

CIs assigned at any one time. This, of course, is by

no means considered a maximum and many Agents

participate more fully in the program.

There are currently no first office agents assigned to

this division and when an Agent is transferred to this

division and assigned to criminal work he is expected

to show some progress by the end of sixty days and

within one year he is expected to je in compliance

with the above standaras.

Special Agents assigned to Squad 2 have been

instructed to continually be alert to develop top quality

informants in order to carry out the responsibilities in

their investigative fields.

The work on the squad is broken

down into two major categories, the first of which includes

bank rowberies and kidnappings.

Agents specifically assigned

to develop informants in this field are SAS, MONTE A. HALL,

FRANCIS J. COLLOPPY, JR., THOMAS J. PADDEN, ARDEN F. KEITH,

ELDEN LOLFFELHOLZ, and WILLIAM R. tenBENSEL.

The following

informants have been developed in this field:

DESK 3

General Criminal Desk

Supervisor MORRIS M. DE JEAN

The main criminal classifications handlea by this

desk are ITSUV, Theft or Destruction of Government Property,

Crime on Government Reservations, Crime on the High Seas,

•Probation ana Parole Violators, Bond Default Fugitives, and

Crime Aboard Aircraft and Air Piracy.

It is noted there are several major military

installations within Headquarters City, including the

Presidio and the U. S. Naval Shipyard at Hunters Point, as

well as numerous Government buildings.

In the ITSMV field SAs DANIEL J. BUCKLEY and

EDWARD C. SAUER have been

assigned to develop informants and

in this regard the following have been developed:

137-470

137-3528

The fugitive classifications handled off this

desk are distributed among the various members of the squad

and in these classifications SAS BERLYN H. CLOW, JAMES E.

TARLETON, JR. and GARY D. MINYEN have been specifically

assigned

to develop informants and the following are informants

Regarding the Government reservations, it is noted

that specific liaison assignments have been made in regard

to these but inasmuch as persons normally contacted on these

bases are Government employees contacted on an official

basis, they are not considered appropriate for development

as CIs and are bound to furnish infornation as part of

their auties.

It is noted, however, that the Hunters Point

Naval Shipyara is in a predominantly egro area and two

PRIS, 170-845 and 170-241, are under development at that

location by sas assignea to this squad.

: Regarding the air piracy and crime aboard aircraft

violations, it is noted all major airports are located within

Resident Agency territories ana coverage at these locations

will be covered there.

• DESK 5

TFIS and ITSP Matters

Supervisor GLENN A. HARTER

A major category on this desk is civil rights

• matters but inasmuch as this classification does not lena

itself to the development of informants it will not be

covered in this write-up.

In TFIS matters the following agents have been

assigned these cases and have been instructea to develop

informants in this fielä:

SAS E. STEPHEN OSBORN, DAVID C.

SUMMING, JAMES R. ECHOLS, RALPH V. FINK, STEPHEN L. JENKS,

and MARSHALL H. FELDMAN.

In this regard the following

informants have been developed:

137-5202

137-5538

137-5358

137-4826

The following agents handle primarily ITSP

matters and have been instructed to develop informants in

this regard: SAS ELLSWORTH F. HEMINGWAY, FREDERICK A. GROS,

and EARL W. BAKER. In addition, a major source of informa-

tion in this field was developed by SA JOSEPH T. FOX, JR.,

who was recently transferred to the Hayward Resident Agency,

and is still contacted by SA FOX.

Selective Service Matters

Supervisor RAY M. ANDRESS:

It is noted all agents assigned to this desk work

Selective Service matters and have been instructed to develop

informants that will be of assistance in this classification.

It is also pointed out that this desk has numerous

subjects that fall in the radical left ard Black militant

category.

Any time

these subjects, when cervisved, appear

to be cooperative in any degree their names and addresses

are furnished to the appropriate desk for consideration as

development to an informant.

Members of this squad continually endeavor to

develop informants in Black neighborhoods; homosexual hang-

outs, and cheap hotel areas where most lugitive Selective

•Service subiects are located.

The following informants have been developed in

this regard:

137-4948

137-4876

It is noted a number of agents on this squad are

recent transferees into this office and there is a total of

thirty PCIs currently under development by members of this

squad.

Due to the varied nature of the criminal work

existing in the Berkeley RA and the relatively small area

covered by the Berkeley RA, no specific targets have been

designated for informant development, but all agents working

criminal matters are constantly alert to the necessity of

having good informant coverage.

The following informants

which are both rural in nature.

All classifications in

this territory are handled by SA MILLER and in view of the

nature of the RA, no specific targets have been designated

for informant coverage.

Two informants have been developed in

this territory and give general criminal coverage. They

are as follows:

137-2613

137-3685

HAYWARD RA

The Hayward RA covers the southern half of

Alameda County and has been a rapidly expanding RA in popula-

tion and nas developea into a large trucking area with a

population of approximately half a million people.

The major criminal problems in this RA have been

TFIS and ITSMV violations.

In this regard, SA SAMUEL A. MILLER has been

specifically directed to develop informants covering IFIS

violations

OAKLAND RA

The Oakland RA covers the northern half of Alameda

County and is

the largest RA, personnel wise, within the

San Francisco Division.

In this regard, its problems, as

related to criminal investigations, are

very much the

same

as Headquarters City.

The following is a list of agents working criminal

matters who have been assigned to develop informants in the

specific classifications they primarily are responsible for,

along with a list of informants developed for coverage in

bY SAS WILLARD E. BASENIAN and DOUGLAS R. AHLSTROM.

The Santa Rosa RA covers three rural counties of

sonoma, rendocino and Lake, comprising some 7000 square

miles in area.

The bulk of criminal activity is located in

and around the headquarter city of Santa Rosa, California

(Sonoma County).

Informant coverage has been established

in the legalized cardrooms and night clubs in this area.

Coverage in the counties of Mendocino and Lake is

limited to the close personal relationship with deputy

sheriffs that cover the remote areas of these counties, which

principal industries are logging and ranching.

There are

no principal targets for informant

development, such as shipping companies, railroads, airports,

or large industries.

Coverage has been established in

gambling, 137-3976 and 137-4486. In night clubs, coverage

has been established with females, 137-5819 and 137-5818,

both of whom are furnishing quality information and will

be

converted as CIs.

NEL INFORMATION CONTAINED,

FER SIN AS UNCLASSIFIED -

DATE 1/20101 BY SPACM J1E

All criminal informant (CI) files and a representative

number of potential criminal informant (PCI) files were reviewed

during this inspection.

Following review, a memorandum

disclosing the rating

afforded in each file has been forwarded

to you for inclusion in the respective file.

Your office is currently operating 145 CIs as

compared to 141 CIs being operated at the time of the last

inspection. There is

also an increase in the number of PCIS

under development at this time to 271 as opposed to 250 under

development auring the lust inspection:

These figures do not

include Top Echelon informants or targets for development

which are commented on separately under the Criminal Intelligence

Program.

This represents

a slight increase in the number of

CIs and a more substantial increase in the number of PCIs

under development.

However, there is a slight decrease in

two large metropolitan areas, namely, San Exancisco and Oakland,

. Khich though slight represents a static situation as to

.. increasing coverage in these areas.

The Oakland Resident

Agency has also recorded a decrease in the number of PCIs

,under development.

In analyzing the coverage in the resident

agencies, it was noted that Monterey, Richmond and San Jose

have the

same coverage from CIs

during the last inspection

although Monterey and San Jose have shown a substantial

increase in the number of PCIs being handled. PCIs under.

development in Salinas and San Rafael are down somewhat,

although this too in part is off-set by the increase

in the

number of CIs being operated.

In view of the Bureau's

increased responsibilities, it is absolutely essential that

a strong criminal informant program be maintained.and in

fact expanded if the Bureau is to meet these increased

responsibilities.

All of the CI files were reviewed auring this

inspection and the following ratings were given to the CIs

presently being operated by this office:

137-213 (Bufile 137-3071).

Because SE 3308-C furnishes

information principally as a result of his employment in

the U.S.

Army, Personnel Center, Oakland, California Army

Base, this informant should be discontinued as a CI and

converted to a Confidential Source.

SF 2290-C was recently

reopened on the basis of having provided a service to

repartment of Justice attorneys and the Bureau but has

furnished

no criminal information for an extended period of time and

had been in a closed status since 3/10/69.

This infornant

should also be discontinued as a CI and considered as a

Confidential Source.

You should appropriately advise the

Bureau that this action nas been taken.

The following informants have been rated Fair and

they should be given specific assignments for a period of

90 days in an attempt to improve their productivity. At

the end of that period of time you should advise the Bureau

of reasons for continuing them as informants or that they

..are being discontinued.

AGENT PARTICIPATION

You have indicated Special Agents JAMES ₽.

JALOY,

CARLTON H. 'WOLFARTH and GARY N. MAVITY have spent 50%'or

more of their time on criminal type investigative matters

during thepast year but do not currently have assigned a

qualified CI personally developed by them. Further comment

is being set forth later in this addendum concerning these

Agents.

PAYMENTS

A review of payments indicates that your office

paid an average of $1,473.98 a month to informants during

the period immediately preceding the last inspection.

FOr

the period immediately preceding this inspection, an average

of $1,643.10 was paid to informants each month.

A spot

check of payments made to CIs and PCIs indicated value was

being received for the money paid. You should insure that

your personnel are alert to

the use of monetary payments to

enlist the further cooperation of informents by compensating

them for expenses incurred in pursuit of information for

this Bureau and as

compensation for their effort on the

Bureau's behalf.

You should continue to closely evaluate

informant payments to insure that value is received for money

paid.

•ACCOMPLISHMENTS

According to Bureau records your office shows

increases in 4 of the 8 statistical accomplishments

attributable to informants and it is noted that these

increases have occurred in matters concerned directly with FBI

investigations.

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT

You have indicated a rather extensive involvement

of supervisory personnel in directing informant development to

those areas of responsibility coming within the scope of

their respective desks. Referring to Government reservations

and military installations, you indicated you do not

consider Government employees appropriate for development as

CIs as they are bound to furnish information as part of

their duties. Your attention is specifically directed to

ПН 35139 D0014: 3290963

175.

---

## Page 103

5

Section 108, I-12, Volume 4, Manual of Instructions, which

states informants

should be developed on Government

reservations and military installations when warranted. In

view of the large installations located within your territory,

it is suggested you identify particular areas of these

installations wherein informant coverage would be logical

and productive and give consideration to pinpointing such areas

for development.

You have also indicated that supervisors approve

payments to informants and in this way are also aware of the

productivity of the informant program. However, it is noted

that approval of payments provides a rather limited

assessment of the productivity of informants and points out

the need for a continuing evaluation of respective coverage.

Supervisors must constantly be alert to identify specific

areas in which informant coverage would be logical and

productive.

• OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

You should give consideration to the development

of informants on Government reservations and military

installations as suggested by the Manual of Instructions.

In a number of instances, it was noted there was

no follow-up on incomplete information furnished by informants.

In such instances, the informant was not recontacted any

sooner than required by the 30 day contact rule, which would

indicate a lack of direction of the informant to further

develop information of interest.

The need to give informants

direction to develop information to the point it can be

considered useful and valuable should be brought to the

attention of all appropriate investigative personnel.

There were few instances noted during review of

the CI files wherein FD-302's had been utilized in recording

informant information. It is recognized that much information

regarding fugitives and possible suspects does not require

HN 35135

Doc1d: 32989633 Page 103

## Page 104

such recording but in view of the recent passage of Senate

Bill 30 which will greatly expand the opportunity to utilize

informant intormation, you should make certain add personnel

• are aware of those instances in which informant information

should be recorded on an FD-302 and the proper method for 'so

recording it.

Numerous areas have been identified in your

territory as being the habitat of ethnic, ghetto and hippie

elements, many with

a high incidence of

crime. To provide

a better

over-all view of the coverage in San Francisco and

the heavily populated East Bay area and to facilitate a more

convenient, ready reference for the agents of your office to

this information, you should consider preparing a large wall

map of the San Francisco - East Bay area and placing It in a

central secure position in the office. In addition to criminal

and ghetto

increased

our payments to informants and no instances have

been found where we did not get value received from these

payments to informants.

We have achieved excellent statistics

from them as indicated by the fact that at the close of the

last fiscal year we were ahead

in all eight categories of

informant accomplishments. This is our continuing goal and

we will make every

effort to surpass these

accomplishments

in the coming months. The observations, instructions and

suggestions of the Inspector will be immediately complied

In the period of time I have jeen

handled a number of PCIs with a view

to the qualification of them as

approved Criminal Informants.

In the past year since I

last had

an approved Criminal Informant I have handled

several

Peis including one who previously was the prime

factor in the apprehension of a Bureau fugitive wanted

for the murder of a police officer.

This PCI has since

furnished information of value which was relayed to the

local police in a burglary case. He has been given the

assignment to develop

further information concerning local

suspects in the handling of stolen merchandise from this

other burglaries.

In the past year I have been unable

to devote a great deal of time to the development of this

and other PCIs due to having been utilized as Relief

supervisor in the absence of the regular supervisor

because of the time necessary to prepare and preseni leviures

at police schools on legal matters.

I am aware of the importance of the

Criminal Informant Program and will continue efforts to

develop a qualified Criminal Informant and expect to

opened on 8/24/70 and the one which I opened 10/19/70 appears

promising and it is anticipated that at least one will develop

into a CI in the near futuro.

My assignments in jai Francises navA

been mainly ITSP - FBi Investigations which are complicated and

Involve reviewing records and interviews with banks, broksrage

house and other business officials. I, had one excellent

opportunity to develop a good CI when LOUIS MARDER, Las Vegas

furnished me on 2/27/70 and 3/2/70 the original information which

led to the recovery of $650,000 worth of avco Thrift Certificates

He cannot be developed

into a CI because

he IIves in Las Vegas and 1s under Federal Indictment In Miami.

I am sorry that this delinquency on

my part happened. It is regretted and I will not let it happen

again.

CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM AND

INTERSTATE CAMBLING ACTIVITIES

PART A. GENERAL

The commercial or lucrative type of criminal

activity in the San Francisco Division continues to be

predominantly confined to

the areas as noted below.

Exhaustive and probative investigation and close liaison

with local state and Federal agencies to date has revealed no

evidence of an organized criminal group controlling these

activities

¿Ungan Francisco of Resident Agency territories.

Investigation contacts with informants and other sources of

information have failed to reveal the existence of any

organized silegu, gambling, loan sharking (Shvlocking),

labor racketeering or planned bankruptcy frauds.

A. Local bookmaking involving horse and

sport bets conducted by numerous local

independent bookmakers, some of whom

have established "lay-off" arrangements

among

themselves.

B.

Prostitution activity primarily in the

Francisco

involving out-of-town businessmen,

tourists, and servicemen with prostitutes,

most of whom are working for unorganized

negro "pimps".

c.

Narcotic activity and related crimes

usually involving thefts and frauds near

universities, military installations, and

"hippie" or Bohemian sections of cities

within the division.

This office continues to enjoy an excellent rela-

tionship with the San Francisco Police Department and its

official

personnel.

Cooperation and excellent relationships

evidence or information has been made availaole to

NO

this

office to indicate that there is any corruption in law

enforcement in this division.

As the Bureau is well aware, Mayor JOSEPM LAWRENCE

ALIOTO was the Subject of anti-rackateering investigation

by this office several years ago, however, this matter has

been closed. ALIOTO prior to assuming the posicion of Mayor

of the city of San Francisco was a prominent and well known

attorney, particularly in the field of anti-trust matters.

He is known to have been the attorney or TONY LIMA, a former

"Boss" of the LCN in San Francisco.

fie also represented a

number of other ICN figures and their associates.

Prior investigation revealed that the cousin of

ALIOTO's father, JOHN ALIOTO, was the former "Boss" of the

Milwaukee ICN Family. JOHN ALIOTO attended the inauguration

of Mayor ALIOTO at San Francisco in Januazy 1968.

As a result of an article published in "look"

.. magazine, September 23, 1969, Linking ALIOTO with Many ICN

figures, ALIOTO filed a $12.5 million libel suit against

"Look"

magazine and the authors of this article, RICHARD

•CARLSON and LANCE BRISSON.

On May 15, 1970, Federal Judge BRUCE THOMPSON

declared a mistrial in San Francisco on this suit in that

the jury was unable to agree on the key issue of whether

the article linking ALIOTO with the "Mafia" was published

with "malice and seckless disregard for the facts."

The

jurors told newsmen that the article was defamatory to

ALIOTO and that at least 50 per cent of the 27 points were

indeed untrue.

There was no agreement as to whether the

falsehoods and the article's general claim that ALIOTO was

"enmeshed in a web of alliances" with the "Mafia" represented

"malice and reckless disregard for the facts."

U.S. Supreme

Court has ruled that such a finding is essential to a libel

juagment sought by a public official.

San Francisco top level informants currently being

handled consist of four members of the ICN and six: TE

informants in the gambling

and related criminal fiolas.

P'3s

ICN TE informants and ten PC target informants report on ICN

activities of the San Francisco and San Jose Families as

well as ICh activities in other divisions. Our other TE

informants and our 36 PC target informants regularly report

on matters involving booknaking, prostitution, pornography

an indication of the level

of our informant coverage since last inspection, SE-2689-C-TE

assumed the position of "Boss" of the San Francisco LCN

Family. These informants due to their positions and locations

have made it possible to obtain top level information necessary

to provide coverage for Items 1 and 2.

Since last inspection extensive investigation as

well as informant coverage led to the first ITAR conviction

prosecutions ever in the San Francisco Division (see Item 7

below).

Investigation

if he failed to pay the debt. This case is currently

under investigation with the matter being presented to

the Federal Grand Jury at San Francisco for violation

of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 894, Extortionate Creait

Transaction

Statute.

It should be pointed out that "BILL" BONANNO

and JOSEPH BONANNO, JR. are the sons of JOSEeN BONANNO, SR.,

a "Commission" member of the ICH in the United States.

The aforementioned Subjects aze also involved

• in

a separate ECT case involving the shakedown and threats to

do bodily harm to. WILLIAM JOSEPH ELLIS.

This matter is

presently under investigation and will

be presented to the

Federal Grand Jury, San Francisco immediately upon completion

of Grand Jury action in the ECKSTIN ECI case.

Since last inspection investigation has continued

in regard to GUISEPPI CONFORTE, the reported Vice lord,

State of Nevada, who ror years

has headed up a major pros

titution operation. Though extensive investigation and

the placement of SF 3239-C-IE and SF 3369-C, this organization

has been completely penetrated identifying his lieutenants

i

scope or operation.

As a result of the above, it has veen

determined that CONFORIE's operation has spread to

the State

of Hawaii being controlled there by one of his top lieutenants,

TOMMY SEALE. San Francisco has under preparation an affidavit

for a request of a Title 3 electronic

affidavit has been prepared with the assistance of Departmental

Attorney at San Francisco and who has discussed same with the

Organizea Crime section, Department of Justice, who nas advised

that upon completion of current investigation in Honolulu the

JOHNSON and FIDLER travelled to San Francisco from Boston in

January, 1970 and

through surveillance and subseguent intensive

investigation it was detérmined that they met with one GEORGE

R. DUNCAN, International Represencative,

International

Typographers Union (ITU). It was determined that shostly

prior to the travel of JOHNSON and FIDLER to the San Francisco

area a strike situation existed at the San Rafael "Independent

Journal" newspaper involving the ITU. Through cooperacion and

Liaison with local law enforcement, Joanson and FIDLER were

arrested near San Rafael, California and found to be in

possession of handguns and mace.

Shortly after the return

Of JOHNSON and FIDLER to the Boston area,

an individual who

had knowleage that they had been given this contract was

• found murderad in Poston and on his bogu were found the names

and telephone nuners ui vommoon and tianet. Througn these

efforis the attempt by JOHNSON and FIDLER to perform the

conditions of the contract were thwarted. In addition, this

matter

is being considered by Departmental Attorney for

possible Federal Grand Jury presentation.

Another example of progress made in the penetration

• in the field of intelligence and organized crime in this area

resulted when through information furnished by top echelon

informants reveaing the presence of ALATADENO JAMES FRATIANNO

• residing in the San Francisco territory. through investigation

and surveillances conducted FRATIANNO was subsequently contacted

and was developed as a top echelon target of this division.

Frequent contacts were conducted with FRATIANNO and extensive

cooperation was obtained from him concerning organized crime

FRATIANNO was identified as a member of the Los Angeles Family

of the LCN and during August, 1970 was indicted by Federal

Grand Jury convening in San Francisco for two counts of

violation of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 894, ECT. Although

presently incarcerated FRATIANNO

During October, 1969, information was received

indicating that JERRY LISNER, major bookmaker, Los Angeles,

California was in contact with JOHN CASTELLI, bookmaker,

Oakland, California.

The purpose of this contact was for

LISNER to establish a base of operation, particularly book-

making, for his criminal activities in the San Francisco

area.

Investigation subsequently established that LISNER

CARL EZEKIAL ECKSTEIN, age 40 years, has been

engaged in gambling activities most of his adult life.

ECKSTEIN was formerly associated with TONY RUIZ and otner

San Francisco bookmakers, but in the last year ECKSTEIN

has set up his own independent operation.

has never been convicted of this violation. In 1965 ECKSTEIN

was convicted for failure to pay Federal wagering tax which

conviction was subsequently overturned.

Details regarding

his current operation are set forth below in Paragraph 3.

CHARLES FRANCIS LEAHY, JR.,

a native San Franciscan,

in his middle 40's, has been engaged in bookmaking activities

The types of gambling prevalent in the San

Francisco Division are primarily wagering on horse races

and sporting events.

In addition, small numbers betting

with a weekly drawing take place usually in the Spanish-

speaking communities.

There are also legal and illagal

card games operating usually in low income commercial

neighborhoods.

Gambling in the division is conductea by

individual operators who are independent of each other,

except for layoff purposes with respect to bookmaking and

there are no indications of hoodlum control over any of

these

activities.

3. Concerning the extent of gambling in this

division; bookmakers ECKSTEIN and LEATY, named in Paragraph

1 above, operate in the following manner.

Both are ii

daily contact with their accounts located in the Bay area

which

include other bookmakers for layoff purposes, split

bookmakers, and numerous individual bettors.

Bets are placed with these operations generally

at locations to which the general public has access, such

as bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and other small

shops.

The "action" received at these business locations are in

turn called in to a phone spot operated by a bookmaker who

has a gambling relationship with the operator of the

business.

ECKSTEIN normally operates with six employees,

including two phone men, a bookkeeper,

a pay & collect man,

and two runners.

In addition, he utilizes several split

bookmakers as employees.

The principal bookmakers and

split bookmakers-involved in the ECKSTEIN bookmaking

operations are THEODORE CHALMIS, ALBERT DiGERONIMO, ELBERT

HEDRICK, MANNY PRONGOS, and ALBERT CARLSON.

ECKSTEIN'S

monthly handle based on informant data, evidence seized by

the San Francisco Police Department during recent bookmaking

raids, and interviews of bettors is estimated to be approxi-

mately $50,000 for horse bets.

His sports "action" varies

with the season of the year and bettor interests in particu-

lar sporting events; however, ECKSTEIN's handle for sports

action is estimated to be $40,000 per month.

1N 35135 D001d:32989633 Page 126

## Page 127

LEAHY's operation normally consists of a separate

phone man for horse racing action

and sports bets, at least

two pay & collect men, and several runners operating in the

vicinity of three San Francisco bars in which LEAHY

reportedly has a hidden interest.

to be associated with LEAHY as bookmakers and/or split

PORE KENNETE

bookmakers are ROBERT HAGIDSON, ATTILIO SPAGNUOLA, VICTOR

FORNER, KENNETH ZAHND, MORRIS COOPER, and. ALBERT CARLSON.

With respect to LEAHY's handle it is to be notea

that a review of records seized at the time of his arrest

or 8/4/70 discloses a daily handle for horse action in the

approximate amount of $2,000 or approximately $50,000 per

month.

Data regarding LEAHY's sports handle is incomplete

but it is estimatod that this handle is comparable to that

of ECKSTEIN.

: •

Based on a review of available gambling records

seized by local authorities on lessor local bookmakers,

it is estimated that they have a monthly handle of approxi-

mately $25,000 each.

Investigation, including contacts

with informants and local authorities, indicates there are

approximately 20-30 lessor bookmakers operating in the

San

Francisco Division on any given day.

Accordingly, it

would

appear that the monthly handle for the San Francisco

Division is in the approximate amount of one million dollars.

4. Sports line is formed by local bookmakers who

receive an

early opinion line from sports services located

in Los Angeles, California, operated either by GERALD

KILLGORE,

DOMINICK "SONNY"

DeFALCO, Or FRANK MILANO.

Upon receipt of this line information, the local bookmaker

will make his own adjustments, if necessary, to suit his

particular situation.

In addition, the local major news-

papers in this division publish line information on a daily

basis prior to a particular sporting event.

Early race results are currently being furnished

to local bookmakers by JERI GORDON MATZA who openly operates

a sports service at 225 Kearny Street, San Francisco.

Investigation has

determined that MariA receives race

results by calling either California Turf, Los Angeles,

a horse race results business operated by FRANK MILANO,

or J & K Sports Journal, North Hollywod, California,

operated by GErALd KILIGORE.

15. Since the last inspection, the san Francisco

Office has developed SF 2661-C-TE, Who is a key operator

within the ECKSTEIN bookmaking organization.

SE 3036-PC,

who was targeted at time of last inspection, has beer

developed to the point where he furnishes detailed

information on a weekly basis regarding the LEAHY bookmak-

ing. organization. This target is a split bookmaker handling

sports

"aclion" for

the LEAky organization.

As a reSult

of information furnished by SF 3036-PC and SF 3237-C-TE,

LEAHY was arrested by the San Francisco Police Department

on 8/4/70 on charges of bookmaking and: convict in possession

of a weapon.

SE 3090-PC was targeted at the time of the last

inspection; however, during the past several months, he

has furnished extensive information regarding several

large bookmaking operations.

SF 3387-C was developed since the last inspection

and was responsible for the initial information and identifi-

cation of a major bookmaking operation in the East Bay area,

including Oakland, California, and Naval Air Station,

Alameda, California.

The informant"s information led to

the arrest and subseguent conviction of the two major

operators within the organization in United States District

Court, San Francisco.

In addition, based on informant's

information and investigation by this office, there were

two arrests and convictions effected by local authorities,

Oakland.

As a result of extensive investigation in the

ECKSTEIN ITWI case, a

"shakedown" on the part of ECKSTEIN

against a local bookmaker was developed.

This investigation

, has resulted in two major ECT cases involving non-payment

of bookmaking debts which are currently under investigation

and before the Federal Grand Jury at San Francisco. To

date, eight local bookmakers have appeared before the

Federal Grand Jury and others will be called. This has had

a disruptive effect among bookmakers and has created an

atmosphere of distrust.

6 .

Pursuant to instructions set forth in Bureau

letter to SAC Albany 1/27/70 regarding gambling investiga-

tions under proposed SB30, a review of gambling cases was

undertaken. It shinid be pointed out that during the past

three years, it has been the policy of the San Francisco

Office to closely follow the activities of local gambling

organizations and/or subjects in an attempt to develop any

indication of a Federal gambling violation.

Per instructions

additional 162 and 165 cases have been opened and investigates.

Specifically since 2/1/70 sixty-three 162 cases and ninety-

eight 165 cases have been opened.

There are currently 8 members of the

Francisco "family"

residing in this division and 19 members

of the San Jose "family" residing in this division.

In addition,

there are two members of the San Francisco

"family" residing in

the Sacramento Division, one member in the Los Angeles Division,

one in the Chicago Division and two members presently residing

in Italy. There are currently 3 members of the San Jose "family"

residing in the Sacramento Division and one in the Las Vegas

Division.

All of these members have been identified as members

of the San Francisco or San Jose "families by TE informants

of the San Francisco Division.

Four top echelon

informants of this division who are

members of LCN"families" have failed to indicate that the ICN

"tamilies" of this division register any control over gambling,

narcotics, prostitution or any other organized illegal activity

wathan this division.

The present leadership of the San Francisco "family"

has

recently been assumed by ANTHONY LIMA, who took over this

position when the

previous

"boss",

JAMES JOSEPH LANZA, stepped

down

in his favor.

The "underboss" of the San Francisco "family"

•is GASPARE "BILL" SCIORTINO and this "family" has one Capo de

Decina, VINCENZO INFUSINO, who resides in Modesto, California,

in the

Sacramento Division.

The leadership of the San Jose "family" remains the same

as at the time of the last inspection report with JOSEPH CERRITO,

the

"boss,

" PHILIPPO OCTAVIO MORICI and STEFANO ZOCCOLI,

Consiglieris, and one Capo de Decina, EMANUEL FIGLIA. No aD-

i ADDENDUM

INSPECTOR ARVOLD

C. LARSON:

10/27/70

The following comments

are based on a review of

information of pending

files and interviews

with appropriate personnel:

LA COSA NOSTRA (ICN)

Investigation by your office revealed the existence

of two ICN "families" within your territory. Membership

within these "families" total 64 individuals. Your

investigation revealed neither "family" is considered to be

very strong and has little or

no illegal operations being

conducted on a day to day basis.

One "family" is centered in the San Francisco area

and has for the pasü fen jars bion hoaded by Jamos Lanza,

an attendee at the Apalachin meeting in 1957.

Lanza has

recently stepped down as boss of the

San Francisco "family"

and has been replaced by Toni Lima.

Your investigation

reveals that Lima's leadership has not been approved by

the "commission." You should follow this matter closely

so you will be in a position to know all activities relating

'to this change in position.

The second "family" is centered in the San Jose area

•and is headed by boss Joe Cerrito.

This "family" exhibits

little enthusiasm for illegal operations.

You should closely

follow the activities of members of this "family" to insure

that any illegal operations are immediately known to your

office.

Organized Crime

Although prostitution, gambling and narcotic activities

exist within your division, there is no indication from your

investigations that these operations are controlled by either

the ICh or other organized groups.

Your investigations

should be continually pursued with vigor in order that your

office will be aware of any illegal operations within your

division.

This

is particularly true in regard to gambling

activities in view of the recent passage of Senate Bill 30.

gamoling activity.

It is noted your office has penetrated the ICN

"families" in both San Jose and San Francisco through the

development of member informants. This is very noteworthy

and you are encouraged to make certain that your member

informants are utilized to the best advantage of the Bureau.

Also, it is noteworthy that you have increased your TE

coverage from 7 to 10 since the last inspection.

SF 3058-C-TE (San Francisco file 137-4670; ureau

file 137-17455) was rated fair because of a lack of productivity.

You should follow instructions issued in Bureau letter dated

July 14, 1970 and if this informant is unproductive for four

months subsequent

to the receipt of that letter the informant

should be closed.

Although SF, 2745-C-TE (San Francisco file 137-3456;

Bureau file 137-11I74) was rated good, his progress should

be closely followed. Although he is noted to be a member

informant the file indicates he is very sick with varicose

veins and is very old. The majority of information furnished

by this source has been of a nature of past activities and

little present information is being furnished by him. You

should endeavor to have him furnish more productive

recent

informant or give consideration to concentrate on a more

productive source.

on June 26, 1970. The file indicates

this source sold his

business and left for Los Angeles and this information was

learned by your office on August 13, 1970. The file also

indicates this TE left the New York

area because of being

a victim of a shylock loan.

In view of this information

you should closely follow this informant's activities and

be circumspect in dealing with the informant to prevent

any possible embarrassing situation from arising.

The only reason this informant is being classified fair,

instead of poor is because information contained in your

informant reported information was furnished by a TE to

the effect that the present "boss" of the San Francisco

ICN

You are instructed that

in the event he does not furnish valuable positive information

within 90 days he should be closed and a more suitable target

developed.

SF 3061-PC (San Francisco file 137-4768; Bureau file

can be conducted. You should without further

delay interview these targets to determine if they will be

cooperative and if not you should consider closing and finding

more suitable targets for development.

Information you furnished indicates there are ten

Sas who are working either exclusively or virtually exclusively

.on the CIP and IGA program who have not developed TEs.

Although all ten Agents have PCs their progress

closely followed to insure their participation in the

development of TEs.

In this regard you may desire to

reiterate provisions of the Manual of Instructions to the

Agents on the program concerning the qualifications of TE

informants.

All Agents are to be reminded that in dealing with

informants, they are to be particularly alert and not

leave themselves open for criticism or false accusations.

The importance of having an alternate contacting Agent

or another Agent along during the course of certain,

interviews is advisable in case any compromising situation

is attempted.

With the recent enactment of Senate Bill 30 you

should concentrate on increasing your informant coverage in

the areas covered by this legislation.

Also in regard to

the passage of Senate Bill 30 dealing with gambling, which

you are aware does not now require interstate activity, you

should not overlook the utilization of your racial informants

to furnish information to your office concerning gambling

activities.

Other divisions of the Bureau have been

particularly successful in coordinating the information

from racial informants in to the CIP and IGA programs.

Statistical Accomplishiients

During the fiscal year (fy) you recorded two convictions

in the CIP-IGA category.

During the fy 1970 your office had

three convictions.

During the first three months of fy 1971

you have recorded one conviction in this category.

According to the information furnished by your office

you have four cases pending prosecution, two of which are

in the 159 (LMRDA-IM) category and two are in the 92

• (Anti-Racketeering) category.

Only one of these cases is

in the CIP-ICA program. A review of your files indicates

that in file 179-24 in a case captioned JAMES FRATIANNO,

EXTORTIONATE CREDIT TRANSACIION (ECT), the subject was

indicted:under Title 18, Section 894 of the u.s. Code.

Your office was working the case under Anti-Racketeering

classification and the file was opened after the ECT

indictment.

In regard to the possible statistical accomplishments,

from the above file it would appear the local office of the

United States Attorney will seek indictments under the ECT

statute.

A review of your cases in this category reveal only

three Office of Origin cases.

The files also indicate instances

wherein there are shylocking

activities among the gamblers

where there are large debts outstanding. A review of your

file 165-100 on Kenneth Joseph Zahnd, aka; Morris Cooper,

ITWI, indicates the local office of the United States

Attorney

appears to be in no rush to seek Grand Juiy indictments on

gambling matters.

If the local office of the United States

Attorney will entertain prosecution under ECT and is in

no rush to seek indictments under the gamoling statute,

you should review at squad conferences

to the program provisions of SAC letter 68-46 dated August

20, 1968 wherein provisions of the ECT statute are set forth.

In relation to statistical accomplishments, prior

experience has shown a direct relationship between Office

of Origin cases in a particular classification and statistical

accomplishments.

As of September 30, 1970 your monthly

administrative report reflects the following Office of Origin

cases in the categories enumerated:

A review of the monthly administrative reports since

the last inspection indicates your office of origin cases

has remained fairly constant since the last inspection.

With the increase of manpower on this program and the

addition of informant development since the last inspection

it is anticipated that your office should be in position at

this point to begin to show results in regard to the

statistical accomplishment phase of this program.

Supervision And Manpower

The CIP and IGA program is supervised by Supervisor

Charles N. Hiner,

Discussions with Supervisor Hiner and

personnel assigned to the program indicate a very enthusiastic

approach to the problems involved in this program.

Immediately prior to the last inspection, by letter

May 29, 1970 captioned "CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM,

ASSIGNMENT OF ADDITIONAL MANPOWER," you advised the bureau

of the addition of ten Agents to be assigned exclusively:

to this program.

Your success since that time has been

noted by the addition of one conviction in 1970 vs. 1969.

Also you have added three TEs to the program and seven

additional PCs.

This is to your credit and you are encouraged

to continue this favorable trend.

However, the collection

of intelligence information, though very important, is only

one phase of this program.

The other phase of the program

which must receive close supervision and personal attention

is the obtaining of convictions to fulfill the Bureau's

responsibility toward statistical accomplishments.

In regard to statistical accomplishments, other

divisions of the Bureau have been very successful in

the utilization of Title 3. The utilization of Title 3

requires

extensive use uf manpurer anu if the title 3 you

are

presently awaiting approval is approred you shoul?

judiciously use manpower in the operation of the Title 3

In regard to the utilization of manpower, it is

imperative that all Agents assigned to this program show

the necessary zeal to accomplish the desired results of

intelligence information and statistical accomplishments.

In the event any Agents assigned to the program fail to

show the necessary enthusiasm consideration should be given

to the reassignment of those Agents to other squads.

There were four instances wherein you were instructed

luring the last inspection to complete the pink sheet anc

although 14 months have passed since last inspection these

pink sheets have not been completed.

wherein Bureau instructions were not followed.

These Bureau

instructions were

is found in your file 162-00-21. Briefly, these instructions

stated that

the 162 classification should be reserved for

appear to be of dubious prosecutive potential and

you should closely follow these cases to insure that when

it is determined they are of no intelligence or prosecutive

value these cases should be immediately closed. Instances

are as follows:

Dissemination

Your office has been very successful in obtaining

favorable results in dissemination of information to local

law enforcement agencies

concerning local violations

developed during the investigation. You are encouraged

to continue this favorable trend; however, you should

bear in mind that violations that were strictly local in

nature previously may now be covered by the recent enactment

of Senate Bill 30.

Those which are determined to be Federal

violations, of course, should be prosecuted in Federal

court.

New Legislation

A review of your files indicates you have complied

with Bureau letter dated January 27, 1970; concerning

the

,then proposed Senate Bill 30.

You should closely follow

guidelines formulated by the

Bureau in regard to this

new legislation in order that your office will be abreast

of the latest information so that the Bureau's responsibilities

in the organized crime field can be fulfilled.

Observations and Instructions

• (1) Provisions of Title 3, the Extortionate Credit

Transaction statute and of the Manual of Instructions

concerning the qualification of TEs should be reiterated

to all Agents on the program at squad conferences.

.. (2) You should stress to all Agents on the program

the necessity of developing quality TEs.

been very successful in this regard in obtaining a

backlog of potential statistical accomplishments.

have prosecutive potential which will obtain the desired

5. Investigations have developed strong

indications that there is a loosely

organized: movement by registrants,

to deliberately crowd the court calendars

in San Francisco to make the reaching

of any one man as slow as possible.

This will also give the violator the

opportunity of getting the indictment

against him dismissed alleging that

the defendent cannot receive a speedy

trial.

6.

The former United States Attorney had

on his staff an assistant handling 25

cases who had never served in the Armed

Forces and was outwardly sympathetic

towards the Selective Service Act

violators.

The new United States Attorney

has a good attitude towards the prosecu-

tion of these violators, however, he has

not completely replaced

the staff of the

old United States Attorney.

A major portion of the Selective

Service Act violations in the San Francisco Division pertains

'to the inductees failing to step forward to be sworn into

the Armed Forces, thereby refusing induction.

The Armed

Forces Examining and Entrance Station located in Oakland,

•California handles all inductions for Northern California

•and part of Nevada

and handles approximately five per cent

of all inductions in the United States.

Approximately 38 per cent of

all refusals for induction into the Armed Forces arise at

Oakland, according to the Department of the Army statistics..

Many registrants from all over the United States come to the

'San Francisco area for the specific purpose of having their

local draft board changed to this area, and after meeting

of freedom due to the slow handling of these cases by the

Selective Service Board, United States Attorney's Office

and the courts. San Francisco has several cases where the

violations are over two years old in which no prosecutive

action has

been taken.

HH 55135 DocId:32989633 Page 149

## Page 150

-4=

4-M-5

It is evident from the

backlog of cases awaiting trial (414), backlog of cases'

awaiting prosecutive action by the Federal Grand Jury

(749) and the fact that these violations are being re~

ceived by your office at the average rate of 175 cases

per month, that something must be done to get these

cases before the courts.

The most aggravated cases should

be singled out and tried first, particularly those indi-

viduals who are members of extremist groups. Experience

has shown that after several subjects have received rigid

sentences, and a widely publicized trial, that many subjects

enter guilty pleas hoping for lesser sentences by avoiding

the Government the expense of a trial.

It is recognized the San

Fxancisco Division has been most forcefully making every

effort to expedite the handling of these cases, particularly

through the judiciary. Indications are that the reiatively

newly appointed United States Attorney is sympathetic and

receptive to the problem

and is making an effort to diminish

the backlog of cases awaiting Grand Jury presentations, but

it is recognized once an indictment is returned, it is then

up to the judiciary to proceed through the final step, to

which they have not been particularly receptive. They have

not responded enthusiastically to handling these matters in

Federal Court.

It is obvious the Federal

Judges in Northern California (San Francisco DiVision) have

resisted any and all pressures brought to bear upon them

concerning this problem.

In my analysis of this situation,

I have determined that the United States Attorney's Office,

personnel of the FBI, and Selective Service personnel have

all attempted to influence the Judges in handling these

matters more expeditiously to no avail. Furthermore, within

recent months there has been wide-spread nation-wide publicity

relative to their coadling and mininizing this particular

has had no effect upon them.

It

would, therefore, appear that the various Federal Judges

will not react to this problem unless some superior influential

individual or group can forcefully bring this matter to their

attention, particularly if such individual or group is one

which the Federal Judges would respect.

The obvious answer

is the Administrator of the Courts for the Federal Judicial

System in Washington, D.C. and/or Chief Justice of the Supreme

couxt, WARREN BURGER.

You are, therefore; instructed

to suggest to the Bureau that the contents of the letterhead

memorandum setting forth this overall problem be brought to

the attention of the Attorney General with the further sug-

gestion that the Attorney General bring this matter to the

attention of the Administrator of the Courts of the Federal

Judicial System and/or Chief Justice BURGER for his analysis

and information, and the further suggestion he may desire to

communicate with the Chief Federal Judge in San Francisco

relative to these matters.

SAC, ASAC, Supervisory and

Agent personnel should take advantage of every opportunity

to personally discuss this aggravated situation with the

United States Attorney, Selective Service Board officials,

SAC contacts and other

prominent individuals to get them

riled up about this ridiculous situation.

Insure that

. continuous cluse liaison is maintained by supervisory and

Agent personnel with United States Attorney's Office and

various local draft board officials to insure that these

cases are promptly processed and prosecuted.

Your office in April, 1969

suggested to the former United States Attorney that arresting

several inductees on the spot might have a favorable effect

upon lowering the rate of refusals at the Oakland Induction

Center.

You should

insure that such arrests are given adequate press coverage..

Such plans should be brought to the attention of the Bureau

for their consideration in making a national press release,

if warranted.

Selective Service Act cases with Agents handling extremist

groups such as the Black Panther Party, Weatherman, SDS, etc.

should be cross-referenced by appropriate

Between

March and September 1970 you received 1,186 Selective Service

Act matters for investigation, an average of 169 (1,186 - 7)

per month.

As Of 10/23/70; 1,163 of the origin cases were

completed.

749 cases are awaiting the United states

Attorney's (USA) prosecutive decision, and 414 cases involve

indictments of subjects and are awaiting trial.

The case

load is split about in half between Headquarters City and

Resident Agents. 17 Agents are assigned to Squad 6 who

handle only Selective Service Act (SSA) matters and their

informants.

One Agent has been on extended sick leave.

Approximately 18 Resident Agents spend between 60 to 100%

of their time on Selective Service Act matters. During

the fiscal year

1970, ending 6/30/70, you recorded 74

convictions and for the first four months of fiscal year 1971,

ending 9/30/70, you have recorded s convictions.

The procedures followed by your office concerning

the immediate handling of subjects who refuse to step forward

at the Armed Forces Examining and Entrance Station, Oakland,

California, appear to save Agent time and Government expense

It Is noted, however? that

several

months elapse between the time the subject is interviewed and

the time the United States Attorney makes his prosecutive

• decision since he insists that the Selective Service file be

processed and forwarded to his office by the State Director of

the Selective Service Board.

You should have Headquarters

city Agents continue close liaison with Selective Service

Boards and the United States Attorney's Office to insure that

these cases receive expeditious processing and are presented to

the Federal Grand Jury at an early date.

Current administrative procedures being followed in

these refusal type cases are as follows:.

The Induction Officer at the Armed Forces Examining

and Entrance Station, Oakland, California, calls an Oakland

Agent when there is going to be one or more inductees who will

refuse to submit to induction. Inductions are handled on

a Rednesday of each week.

The Special Agent witnesses

the

refusal, conducts a short interview of the Subject, and in

almost

every instance secures an admission from the Subject

that he knew he was violating the law and that he had thought

about this matter carefully before refusing to step

forward. The Agent during this interview obtains the Subject's

current address which is generally different from the one he

furnished the Selective Service Board.

The Agent places

the Subject on notice as to what probably will occur as to an

indictment,

summons, etc.

The Subject is cautioned to remain

in touch with his Local Draft Board in order to avoid being

a Bureau fugitive.

A case is immediately opened and assigned to the

Oakland Agent who prepares a report. Information copies of

the report are furnished to the local USA, San Francisco: and

the field office and the USA covering the Subject's draft

board when located

in another division.

It is the USA's

opinion (San Francisco) that the refusal to step forward

takes

precedence over any prior delinquencies and will be handled

Dy the USA, San Francisco.

Instructions

are given in leads

to Headquarters city Agents and/or

auxiliary offices to

closely

follow the Lucai boara to Insure that all pertinent

information regarding

the Subject is promptly furnished

to the USA, San Francisco.

In order to streamline the administrative handling

of these matters as

well as keeping the Bureau fully

informed of the activity you are taking in these matters to

insure prompt prosecutive handling, the following instructions

should be followed:

All refusal cases and all other cases in which

the investigation is completed should be reassigned to three or

four Headquarters city Agents.

These Agents will have

these cases to the Federal

Grand Jury and on the trial

calendar.

Those cases in which

the subject becomes a fugitive should be reassigned to another

case Agent.

at the present time there are 1163 cases pending

rosecutive action.

In order to eliminate status letters

and

reports to the Bureau in these type cases, the following

procedures should be followed.

Memos to the SAC should be placed in individual

files to keep them from becoming delinquent.

When the

Subject is indicted the Bureau should be immediately advised

in each

individual case. Beginning 10/30/70 and continuing

on the 15th and 30th of each. subsequent month, you are to

advise the Bureau, by letter,

identifying each case by San Francisco file number; Bureau

the number of cases completed and

awaiting Federal Grand Jury action; number of new cases

received for investigation and general comments concernin

the attitude of the USA's Office and U.S. District Courts

concerning these matters. Also you should comment on any

favorable publicity being given these matters by the local

press media.

In the refusal cases the Bureau should be spectrunli!

advised of the status of a case within five months after lir

violation.. The USA should be requested to advise of the

prosecutive action he intends to take in each case and this

information reported in the individual file.

It is felt that better liaison cun ba mintained

present these cases in a group thereby eliminating 30 to 7

different Agents presenting their cases separately. The

Bureau will

be kept advised on a semi-monthly basis of

the activities of your office in getting these SSA mattery

through the courts. The above procedures will eliminate

'the dictation and typing of approximately 750 pages each

month.

There are a sufficient number of SSA cases in

• The FBI Handbook, Part III, Chapter 13, Paragraph

F, Page 192, states as follows:

"If complaint is received involving a

minor Theft From Interstate Shipment where there

are no known aggravating or unusual circumstances,

inmediately present facts to USA for prosecutive

opinion. If USA will not consider Federal prose-

cution, conduct no investigation, advise complainant,

and, where appropriate, refer matter to law entorce-

ment agency having jurisdiction. Confirm to USA and

complainant in writing opinion and action taken."

None of the aforemontioned casos roviowed indicate

you are referring minor violations to the U. S. Attorney to

determine if he would prosecute in the event a subject was

identified.

There were numerous incidents wherein information

had been received and the file contained no FD-302s and no

indication that the ED-302s had been dictated.

The tollowing is a list of these files which includes

only those files wherein the case is at least 15 calendar days

SAC ROBERT E. GEBHARDI

The USA advised this office by

letter dated: 7/16/69 that the

FBI should no longer present minor theft cases to the USA's

office and that these cases shoula be deferrea to local

courts.

The office has lollowed the policy set down by the

USA and has utilized his guideline of $100 as a minor case.

In view of his policy, the office has not been receiving minor

theft cases: as the local business community has been made

aware of the policy of the USA and has not been referring

minor cases to the office.

Occasionally some minor case is received from

someone not aware of the policy of the USA's office in not

prosecuting cases having

a value of less than $100.

In the

future when a complaint is received regarding a minor theft:

the case will be immediately presented to the UsA and arter

his declination, the office will advise the complainant and

• the violation.

This procedure will be in line with the

roquiraments in the Manual of Inspection: Section 94.

ADDENDUM

C. LARSON: In regard to your answer to this

write-up, the following is

pointed out to you:

I. Your answer implies the inspector indicated that

all suitcase-type thefts are minor thefts.

This is completely

inaccurate as each case, whether it be a suitcase or otherwise,

has to be juaged on the

merits of the individual case. In

the review of 140 cases there was not one single instance

wherein the United States Attorney had been consulted to

determine if the case was a minor amount and he would not

entertain prosecution even if the subject were identified.

2.

Concerning the submissions of FD-302's to the

file, the following is a tabulation of cases over two months

old in which no FD-302 is in the file:

Although the remainder of the 25 files pointed out to

you did not contain FD-302's and the files had not come

up on ticklers for your review, it is apparent with this

number of files without FD-302's the Agents are not receiving

adequate instructions in conferences concerning proper

preparing of FD-302's in TFIS cases.

3. Although it was pointed out to you wherein!

NCIC entries on serial numbers

had not come up for adminis-

trative review,

it is apparent that several Agents on your

squad have not been properly instructed in the necessity

of immediately entering serial numbers into NCIC. It should

not be necessary for you to have to remind Agents on your

squad on a periodic file review of the necessity of entering

serial numbers into NCIC.

They should not wait an extended

period of time to enter these numbers in NCIC, but the serial

numbers should be entered immediately after they are obtained.

4. File 15-11981 was of a purely local nature and

should have been worked out of the related Federal violation

case rather than open a separate TFIS case wherein no

Federal jurisdiction was indicated in the opening serial.

SUGGESTION MEMORANDUM

BOND DEFAULT MATTERS

INSPECTOR ARNOLD C. LARSON:

As of 10/1/70, the San Francisco

Office had 48 bond default

matters under investigation.

This volume of cases presents

a fertile field for increased convictions under the Bond

Default classification.

An in depth survey conducted by the Inspection

Division disclosed that there has been a significant

increase in cases received by the FBi for investigation

subsequent to the passage of the Bail Reform Act of 1966.

This Act liberalized bail and bond procedures in Federal

cases whereby subjects were to be considered for release

on their own personal recognizance or unsecurea appearance

bond

in contrast to previous procedures which

required a

specific bond, creating an excellent opportunity for us

to achieve statistical accomplishments.

The ratio of

convictions to the number of cases investigated in bond

default matters is one of the highest of any violation

handled by the Bureau.

One of our offices,

namely San Diego, has been

responsible for the most significant portion of the Bureau's

convictions in bond default matters as

a result of effective

liaison with the U. S. Attorney, who felt that an indictment

obtained under bond default was more easily proven than

the substantive offense.

When a subject is apprehended,

the sentence is, in part, influenced by the U. S. Attorney,

who informs the court the length of time the subject's

apprehension has been sought by the Bureau.

A number of

these cases have arisen through charges of

narcotics and

"smuggling of merchandise and aliens across the border.

Subjects were brought before

a magistrate, and rather

pleading guilty, subjects obtained a court appointed

attorney and

entered

a not guilty plea.

They were released

then on either personal recognizance or a minimum bond until

their scheduled

appearance.

When the subject failed to

appear in court, a bench warrant was issued, San Diego opened

a case, and. usually within 30 days an indictment was secured

under bond default.

Although San Francisco is not a border office,

it is a great port of entry, both by sea and air, and many

of the same type cases utilized by San Diego for

obtaining

a bond default indictment should be available to San,

Francisco.

As you are aware, convictions are becoming more

difficult to obtain because of the court's interpretation

of the law in many classifications.

Bond default matters

present an excellent opportunity to increase your conviction

rate, therefore, it is suggested that through your liaison

INSPECTOR ARNOID C. LARSON; This is a closed case which was

opened in the San Francisco

SA RICHARD G. MILLER and supervised by Relief Supervisor

RICHARD E. LUEBBEN OnJEK'ACt & (3)K Of SA ANDRESS. Case was again

closed 9/3/70.

The case was initially opened on the basis of a

copy of a letter directed to local Board 4, Fureka,

California, from the Armed Ferces Baminimy

an Entrance

Station, Oakland. The letter indicated that the Subject

reported for induction 4/14/70, was found qualified,

but left

the building prior to induction. Case was closed 6/15/70,

on'basis of a memorandum from SA ROBERT M. LEONARD wherein

it was pointed out that the violation was not such as to be

reported to the U.S. Attorney by the Selective Service

System.

Case was reopened 8/26/70, on receipt of a request

for investigation from the U. S. Attorney,

San Francisco,

and assigned to SA RICHARD G. MILLER.

Review of

the file

indicates that Subject was interviewed by SA MILLER 9/1/70,

at which time he indicated he would agree to induction.

U. S. Attorney declined prosecution and a closing

report was submitted 9/3/70, with copy to U.S. Attorney and

San Francisco Office.: This report was signed by SA RICHARD

E. LUEBBEN.

This report contains FD 302 (interview report

form) wherein interview of Subject was recorded. The FD 302

fails to indicate that the Subject was advised of the

identity of SA MILLER or the nature of the inquiry.

The Manual of Rules, and Regulations, Part 2,

•Section 5, Page 1, indicates that Bureau policy under

Executive Order 10450 is to furnish the Civil Service

Commission all pertinent identifiable, derogatory non-

subversive information relative to employees of the Executive

Branch of the government.

This is normally accomplished by

including such information in letterhead memorandum form

and transmitting same to the Bureau for appropriate dissemination.

INSTRUCTIONS

Immediately handle this matter in accordance with

Bureau instructions cited above.

EXPLANATIONS REQUESTED

1. SA KENNETH W. SHEETS is requested to explain

why he neglected to forward to the Bureau in letterhead

memorandum form the information developed concerning JOIN C.

BAUER, as required by existing Bureau instructions.

2. Supervisor ROBERT D. ROBY is requested to

explain why, in his over-all supervision of this case, he-did

not detect this error as set out above.

Comments of SAC requested.

SA. SHEETS:

JOAN C. BAUER advised at the outset

of the interview on 8/13/70 that she

could consider herself a member of the communal "family",

however, this became a matter of interpretation during the

course of interview and eventually she denied she was a member

of the "family" or commune.

She admitted visiting people

connected with the commune and associating with them, even to

the extent of allowing some of these individuals to use her

address for the purpose of receiving mail and food stamps.

This matter was discussed at length

with Security Officer RALPH MAINES and JOHN VAN ETTEN, Head of

Security at NASA, Moffett Field, California. They made no

statement as to what action they intended to take.

I realize now that I should have

also prepared a letterhead memorandum for dissemination to NASA

Headquarters in Washington, D.C. I regret not having done-so and

in the future will insure that such matters are promptly

disseminated.

EXPLANATIONS REQUESTED :

SA DOUGLAS R. AHLSTROM is requested to explain

why he failed to detect the lead

at Walnut Creek had not

been covered before the case was closed on 10/15/70.

Field Supervisor BRYON C. WHEELER is requested

to explain why he failed to assign

a lead to a

insure that this investigation had been conducted before he

approved the closing of this case (San Francisco letter to

Los Angeles dated 10/15/70).

sA DOUGlAs R, AlLstop the writer was of the

impression that the lead at Walnut Creek to identify a

telephone subscriber had been covered and reported at

the time the case

was

RUC'a on 10/15/70. The writer did

nọt have the file available as the RUC communication was

submitted from the Santa Rosa Residence Agency and was

therefore unable to make a thorough review of the file.

Steps will be taken to make certain this does not recur

'in the future.

SUPERVISOR BRYON C. WHEELAR®

The lead to check

out a telephone number at Walnut Creek was inadvertently

overlooked at the time the case was reopened and assigned

to SA AHLSTROM.

Upon receipt of the RUC communication closing

the case on 10/15/70, the fact that the walnut Creek lead

had not been covered

was overlooked. Efforts will be made

to.

lll x the future. Case reopened.

SAC ROBERT E. GEBHARDE

explanations have been noted. If will be stressed among

Special Agent and Supervisory personnel in this office
