Baltimore is also furnishing one copy each of the memorandum to

the United states Attorney, Baltimore, Maryland, and to Internal

Revenue Service, Baltimore.

washington Field office advised by telephone call on June 17,

1903, that at midnight, the night before RH 95-C-TE had furnished

information that the States Attorney at Leonardtown, Maryland,

planned to take those arrested and run them through on guilty

pleas early that morning before the Grand Jury convenes in order

to get them out on fines only. Informant further stated that all

the gamblers in the area knew that it was FBI pressure which was

responsible for the arrests. The operators felt they were going

to be raided and accordingly, pulled out their roulette wheels

and blackjack table.

They also called in the local Sheriff

and told him their feelings.

The Sheriff reportedly assured them

that the States Attorney was on their side and that he thought the

Deputy Sheriff, whom they had attempted to pay off, would take

no action for a few days.

In view of this and the amount they

had invested, they decided to go ahead and hold a crap game

anyway.

Developments as set out in enclosed letterhead memorandum, indi-

cate alleged plans, if actual, were frustrated.

This and

other

similar corroborative intormation obtained directly Irom subjects

by top level confidential informants of the Norfolk and Washing-

ton Field Offices, was not included in the memorandum to avoid

compromising the informants.

These Informants can be especially

valuable in Bureau's continuing investigation to develop inter-

state gambling or bribery violations from evidence so far secured

by the FBI and Maryland State Police.

Baltimore Office made available to Maryland State Police informa-

tion developed, indicating viclations of State statutes, which

had been developed as of June 10, 1963. Arrangements were also

made by Baltimore with the FBI Identification Division for expedi-

tious furnishing to Maryland State Police of past identification

records on principal subjects and for special searching of curr-

ent fingerprint cards on gamblers arrested June 13, 1963. Special

Agent THEODORE M. MALINOWSKI was also made available to furnish

critical testimony on June 18, 1963, In St. Marys County Trial.

Magistrate's Court, regarding contact of JOSEPH FRANCIS NESLINE

and CHARLES TOURINE, with Deputy Sheriff

BENJAMIN H. BURROUGHS,

JR., NA.
