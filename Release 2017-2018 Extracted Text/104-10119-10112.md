Office Memorandum • UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

TO

Chief, Security Research Staff, OS

DATE: 24 January 1961

FROM

Chief/RB/SRS/OS

SUBIBCT:

Everett Howard HUNT, JI.

#23500

Attached is a copy of a cable which was brought to my attention by

Mr. O'Neal, CI/SIG.. Mr. Horton had requested that Mr. O'Neal check

concerning any information developed by the Office of Securlty.

The attached cable indicates that Subject is furnisbing information

of a type, which he should not be furnishing, to certain

offigials, whom he presumably knew during previous assignment in

The cable also appears to raise the question concerning how

Subject could recently purchase a $70, 000 home in Washingtoz, D. C.

A check of Subject file indicates that Subject has some outside income

since he has written a number of "pocket books" and has certain

corporation stocks.

The following Security action is recommended:

(a) Credit checks be conducted on Subject in the Washington,

D. C. area and information obtained in regard to his

Indicated purchase of a home including financial arrangements.

If prig

(b) Appropriate officials of JMARC be briefed concerning the

information regarding

and a discreet inquiry

made concerning whether Subject is making :other indiscreet

remarks and statements concerning his current assignment.

Subject has been a problem in the past and apparently continues to be

a problem. If information can be obtained other than the cable information

which apparently could not be used, it is felt that Subject should be given

at least a strong warning concerning indiscreet remarks and unauthorized

disclosure of information.

Attachment as noted above.
