¿ Revision of AMSPElL Project

ACTION REQUIRED: FYI

1, During the past sew months, the Station has been conducting

a review of the AMSPELL project and

analyzing its effectiveness past

and current as well as its short and long term potential.

foregoing, together with continuing problems with the AuSpelL

loadership to conform to budgetary allotments and approred operational

activities, has resulted in a decision to sharpls reduce Station

• support to the AMSPELL organization.

2.

The AMSPELL organization has been affected by the loss of

many of its most capable members who have outlived the jouth/student

category and have resigned to seek employment outside of the JAWAVE

ared.

Marty of the departed members were those who have made major

contributions-in MHSPAIN activities.

Those who have remained are

largely ineffective for use in Station MHSPAIN operations due largely

field, and in addition an lot of Asped leetests when sURE

interest, and talents in the youth/studen

has existed especially in the field of paramilitary operations where

AMSPELL would like to be independently

active.

The Station, through

principal agent Sherwood L. OVERBEY, has had a series of conversations

with the AMSPELL leadership and the

result has

been their acceptance.

of drastically reduced financial support, continuance of contact and

willingness to respond to Station request for specific propaganda

and political-action activities.

The Station now plans to provide maximun financial support

of $1,000.00 monthly to AUSPELL beginning Febriary 1966.

The greater

portion of this sum will finance the printing and distribution of

a new, bi-monthly publication to be sent to selected international

and PBRUBEN addressees.

The remainder will be spent for operational

expenses incurred by AMMIINT-2, who will participate in the preparation

of the magazine and who will be available for maintainino contacts

and for travel in the international student field, and for occasional

operational support and

overhead expenses.

Per ASHINT-2's request

and in view of the desire

of AUSPELL members to seek independent

it is expected that the Station will be able to maintain

a productive contact with the ASPELL organization, which will

ASPire feel but at red cer fatecer pectore operations

AbSPELL members will be available: for whatever specific

the Station may wish to pursue in the student field.

The bi-monthly

AMSPELL publication, which will replace the two publications which

are now being produced and distributed on a regular basis, will be

monitored by the Station and will be avallable to serve as & propa-

ganda and replay mechanism.

5. It is felt that the abové cutback of AMSPELL activities

represents a realistic appraisal of the: operational capabilities

of the project and, particularly in view of current budgetary

considerations, a significant reduction of overhead and payroll

expenses will also be realized in the future management of the

project.

Unless advised to the contrary, the Station plans to

initiate the above changes as outlined during February 1966.
