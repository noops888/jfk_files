SF-2550-C-TE was contacted by SA RUDOLPH H. MANCINI on

6/14/68 and 6/17/68, and furnished the following information:

He came down with a virus infection on Tuesday, 6/11/68, which

lasted throughout the week; therefore, he was unable to personally

contaet ALEX CAMARATA or PETE MISURACA to instruct them to travel

to san Jose, California, for personal contact with MANNY FIGLIA.

On Thursday

• evening, 6/13/,68, ALEX CAMARATA telephonically contacted

him at his home and

expressed concern that the informant had been

out of touch.

Informant explained his illness and suggested that

ALEX contact PETE and make arrangements for them to meet with MANNY

FIGLIA in San Jose as soon as possible. AlEX agreed to contact

552

MANNY in San Jose personally: however, he objected to going

lose with Plit, stating he would not '

During the above conversation, ALEX also related that PETE

GIAMONA had been in contact with him

earlier that week at his home

and he expressed a desire to meet with the informant. ALEX said he

telephonically contacted informant's residence but was unable to

reach anyone. Informant explained that at that particular time he

and his

were probably at the hospital visiting their sick nephew.

ALEX said that before PETE GIAMONA departed his residence, he said

he had to make a trip "back East" which would also include Florida.

ALEX did not relate to this further.

On Monday, 6/17/58, informant contacted ALEX at his home

in Martinez, California.

ALEX related that he had contacted MANNY

FIGLIA at San Jose on Sunday, 6/16/68, and that he was very disturbed.

MANNY expressed concern because PETEwas not with him and said he was

a pete Misun to Follow in trust on

to know why he and PETE were disregarding direct orders from their

"capo" which is just in time. ALEX explained that they all have

a lot at stake here and that somebody might end up in jail; there-

fore, they all must proceed cautiously:

Informant stated.that this

the mistrust and

resentment

that is fermenting among the

members of the San Jose family as

magazine suit. ALFX advised that MANNY informed him that JOE CERRITO

a deposition.

MANNY

inforned him that he and. PETE, like himself, are to "take the Fifth"

when questions are put to them.

ALEX said MANNY also gave him the

impression that JOE CERRITO also will "take the Fifth" during his

deposition.

note).

SF-2550-C-TE was contacted by SA RUDOLPH H. MANCINI on

6/21/68 and furnished the following information:

On Tuesday, 6/18/68, he met MANNY FIGLIA at San Jose,

California, knowing

he had furnished a deposition earlier that day

in the JOE CERRITO-"Life" Magazine matter.

MANNY informed, with

the exception of his name and address, that he had taken the "Fifth"

in answer to all questions. He advised that he replied to ali

questions, "I refuse to answer on grounds that it might tend to

incriminate me."

MANNY said that the attorneys handling the ques-

tioning were not "local yokels" but big-time attorneys from back

East.

He said that he would not even admit that he knew his wife

or that they lived together.

MANNY said they also asked him if he

knew of a party by the name of "AL COSTA"

MANNY explained that JOHN ARDIZZONE, JOE CERRITO's attorney,

was present during his deposition and ARDIZZONE later commented that

the questions "were not too bad" and perhaps they should have answered

them because there might be trouble later on. MANNY told informant

he should immediately contact PETE MISURACA and ALEX CAMARATA and

inform them of what he, MANNY, had done.

FIGLIA pointed out that

he was not telling them what to do, but he wanted them to know how

he had handled the matter and suggested that they do the same.

Informant then questioned FIGLIA, stating this was in con-

trast to his previous contacts where FIGLIA stated these were

CERRITO's orders.

MANNY then replied, "well, they know what they're

supposed to do.

I just want them to know how I handle it." MANNY

said he was particularly worried about PETE MISURACA as to what he

might say during questioning.

On Tuesday night, 6/18/68, he met ALEX CAMARATA and PETE

MISURACA at MISURACA's home in Richmond, California.

He informed

them of his personal contact with FIGLIA and that FIGLIA had "taken

the Fifth" during his deposition earlier that day. MISURACA informed

that he might not show up to honor the subpoena. on. 6/20/68 as he

did not sign it.

ALEX and the informant finally convinced MISURACA

that he had to honor the subpoena or it would be trouble for every-

body.

one

which contained an article that made reference to him.

MISURACA then producer en teque of the "Life" MagaZinEtr

said, "I'm going to make them pay for this stuff. I'm going to sue

'Life' Magazine for twenty million dollars. I'm

going to give each

of you guys one million dollars."

On thursday, 6/20/68, Informant met ALEX CAMARATA and PETE

MISURACA at the MISURACA residence in Richmond, California, at which

time the discussion centered around depositions furnished by CAMARATA

and MISURACA earlier that day. CAMARATA commented that there was

"nothing to it."

He said he furnished hs name and address and took

the "Fifth" on all other questions.

Informant said that it was

apparent from talking to PETE MISURACA that he did answer certain

questions, but MISURACA would not be specific as to what ones he

answered or what answers he might have given.

MISURACA said that during the taking of his deposition,

an attorney showed him a cancelled check in the amount of $56,000.00

made out to PETE MAYO, allegedly issued by Harold's Club in Reno,

Nevada. The check reportedly was cashed by someone who endorsed it

as PETE MAYO. PETE said they would not tell him when or where the

check was cashed so he denied having any knowledge of it. PETE

commented that after completing his deposition,

he and' JOHN

ARDIZZONE had a brief discussion alone. He said ARDIZZONE said tc

him, "Pete, you did a beautiful job."

Upon hearing this, CAMARATA

immediately threw up his hands as the statement conveyed a special

meaning that was caught by CAMARATA and the informant. Informant

explained that the word, "beautiful," has a different connotation

when used

Sicilian language and

that ARDIZZONE was actually

telling PETE that he "fouled things. up."

ALEX said to MISURACA,

and it's not going

to look after myself."

PETE

then referred to CERRITO as being

"greedy" in that he had an op-

portunity to withdraw the suit against "Life" after it had been

filed and in not taking this opportunity, he made trouble for every-

one. ALEX CAMARATA then cut in and said, "Pete, you're always

ready to blame someone when you don't know what

you're talking

about.

Why do you think I was not at yourwedding? I was on an

errand."

Informant said this statement by CAMARATA recalled the

wedding of PETE's daughter in December, 1967, in Berkeley, California,

which was attended by LCN members, JOE CERRITO, MANNY FIGLIA and

SAL COSTANZA.

« yet in December co

he recalled PElE greeting JOE CERRITO and shaking

his hand and saying, "I see you're here,

CAMARATA's-absence from the wedding was immediately dropped.
