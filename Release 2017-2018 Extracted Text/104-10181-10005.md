On 16 January 1969 QUIINID reported a discussion

between Subject and the Chief of the Rumanian Trade. delegation.

during which the Rumanian asked when they could neet;

Subject invited the Rumanian to his home where, he said,

has set up a smäll office and was beginning to work more at

home than in the office, because of the added comfort.

wouldn't be surprised if this was suggested by his wife who

is very jealous of her husband.)

for 1130 hours on 17 January.

The meeting was arranged

• AMAUTO-1 commented that he is

up quite early in the morning, presumably to begin work in

his office.:

The above report is the first we have received on

Subject's

use of his

home as an office.

The invitation to

the Rumanian, of course, casts suspicion on the nature of the

conversation.

Since his move to new quarters, AMAUTO-l's home is

about 50 yards from two WOFIRM staffers - Martin B. CRYMM and

Conrad B. FALAGIARO.

(See attached sketch) .

Edwin B. RATTEREE

lives: approximately 200 yards from the AlAUTO hume.

with his

the 10110wing which may be of possible interest to addressees.

Although part

of the discussion

was not heard because of the

enot tonal Inflection of the speakst, da feel that the fist. of

the discussion is clear and understandable.

"We are demonstrating to the world that Cuba. 1s

favorably disposed to do whatever... (AMAUTO-1 begins

to talk against the United States) that when the

Americans have to raise the white flag. because the

first plane that appears on radar... (AMAUTO1 1s

speaking excitedly and itis very

difficult to understand

each word but it appears that he is talking about the

positions of missiles in Cuba), Havana, Las Villas and

canaguey and that with these missiles,

we can cover

Maml, New York, and all their bases and all of their

"mierda".

• • if

the Americans say they are going to

sad them (misuiles? planes?), we will send

them; if

they (Americans) say they are going to invade us, the

the. Soviets to withdraw

their missiles). • •(AMAUTO1

injected) "they (the Soviets) presented

them (the

Cubans) with ten bombs".

Our reason for reporting this fragmentary information is

that ANAUTO-1 might be confirming the presence of offensive mis-

the couriers

and their pouches when any cone in,

leaving visitors

to
