RE: MILITARY AND NAVAL MATTERS - CUBA

113-7-210

NOTE, CONTINUED:

plans being made in Cuba and elsewhere by communist conspirators

to train individuals who will invade many Western Hemisphere

countries, including the U. s.

Part of the alleged plan involves

stopping of gasoline trucks and "taking over the gasoline," and

the taking over of all

small towns, especially those having many

wooden homes. The paper also alleges that 50,000 Soviet marines

who are already in Cuba would land at several places in North

and South America. The paper was printed over the signature of

"Anti Communist Underground General Headquarters:

Bahamas."

Since Miami has entree to sources who, in all likelihood,

can

furnish the identity of the group originating the paper, this is

not being referred to the British at this time. fed
