Dear Mr. Breckinridge:

In connection with its investigation into the circum-

stances surrounding the assassination of President John F. Kennedy,

the Select Committee on Assassinations requests that the enclosed

two pages of John McCone's testimony before this Committee and the

enclosed eleven pages of Barney Hidalgo's executive session testi-

mony before this Committee both be declassified.

Subject to the

Agency's declassification of this material, it will be entered into

the Committee's public hearings record on Tuesday, September 26,

• 1978.

Regarding public disclosure of Mr. Hidalgo's name, please

note that the Committee does not intend to refer to or disclose

in any way Mr. Hidalgo's identity.

Since some of the information cited in this letter is derived

from classified information, consideration should be given to as-

signing this letter an appropriate classification indicator.

Thank you for your continued cooperation.

COMMITTEE SENSITIVE

Mr.

Scott Breckinridge

Principal Coordinator/HSCA

Office of Legislative Counsel

Central Intelligence Agency

Washington, D. C. 20505

Dear Mr. Breckinridge:

I write in reference to the Committee's requests of 6

June 1978 and 8 June 1978 that the Central Intelligence Agency

make available for review by Committee staff members all files

and index references to the following individuals:

Luisa Calderon

AMMUG/ 1

During the week of 2 July 1978, various files concerning

the above-named individuals were made available for review to

Charles Berk of this Committee.

Mr. Berk has now reviewed

Luisa Calderon's 201 file and

AMMUG/1's Office of Security file,

Office of Personnel file, and Volumes One and Two of AMMUG/1's

201 file covering the period 25 April 1964 - October 1965.

After a careful review of these materials, it has been

determined that CIA-originated reports of 5 May

1964, 6 May

1964, 7 May 1964, 8 May 1964, 11 May 1964, and 19 June 1964,

each

based upon AMMUG/1's knowledge, are absent from the

materials provided to Mr. Berk. Furthermore, neither notes nor

memoranda upon which these reports may have been based are

present in the files.

The content of these reports, notes and

memoranda

are of substantial interest to the Committee. It has

also been determined that AMMUG/1 material now stored by the

CIA at itsi

Jhas not been made fully

available to the Committee.

This omission came to Mr. Berk's

attention inadvertently during a conversation that he had with

Chris Hopkins.

Mr. Berk's review of a 1 May 1964 CIA originated dis-

patch also indicates that at least twenty-two reels of tape

COMMITTEE SENSITIVE

recorded interviews conducted by CIA representatives with

AMMUG/1 are absent from the files provided thus far to the

Committee.

These twenty-two reels of tape recordings were

listed as

attachments to the above-referenced CIA dispatch.

The actual interviews from which the tape recordings were

generated were conducted shortly after AMMUG/l's defection

Erom the Cuban Intelligence Service. Furthermore, three trans

scripts of tape recorded CIA interviews with AMMUG/1 are absent

from the files thus far provided to the Committee.

These

transcripts were listed as attachments to a CIA-originated re-

port of 30 April 1964.

The actual interviews upon which the

transcripts are based

were also conducted shortly after AMMUG/l's

defection from the Cuban Intelligence Service.

In the case of Luisa Calderon's CIA files, CIA informa-

tional reports, cables, and dispatches referenced to in her 201

file have been

found to be absent from that file.

In addition,

a CIA transcript of a telephone conversation in which she par-

ticipated on the day of President Kennedy's assassination is

absent from her 201 file.

The absence of these reports, notes, memoranda, and other

material from the AMMUG/l files and the Luisa Calderon files

reviewed to date may be an indication that other related

materials have not yet been made available to the Committee for

review.

The Committee therefore reiterates its request that all

files and index references on Luisa Calderon and AMMUG/1, in-

cluding but not limited to production files, operational

files,

soft files and subject files, be made available to the Commit-

tee as soon as possible.

The Committee further requests that AMMUG/1 CIA case

officers Harold Swenson, and Barney Hidalgo, FNU Langosch, and

Daniel Flores be made immediately available for personal inter-

views with Committee staff members.

As some of the matters discussed herein may be of a

sensitive or classified nature, this communication may require

appropriate classification.

Thank you for your continued cooperation.

In connection with its investigation into the circum-

Committee on Assassinations requests access to a report written

by Bruce Solie in 1967. This report critiqued the 800 page

Because this report is derived from "Top Secret"

classify it.

As in the past, and as we will continue to do in the

future, we are making a basic assumption that your search and re-

sponse include all files and index references pertaining to any

and all registered or unregistered

aliases and cryptonyms that

were used by, or assigned to, such persons.: We request further

that your search include all files that are centrally indexed

as well as those that are maintained in a non-centralized man-

ner.

This search should specifically include, but not be

limited to, the Western Hemisphere Division files, the Office

of Security files, the Office of Personnel files, the Techni-

a ol Finance 206.

cal Services Division files, and the Office of Finance files.

Because item #38 above and the paragraph below are derived

from "Top Secret" material, you might find it appropriate for

the Agency to so classify them. All copies held by this office

have been marked "sensitive".

Finally, please be advised that the Committee will pro-

vide you shortly with the names of those staff members who are

to be given direct access to selected portions of the 1977

CIA Staff Study.

Thank you for your cooperation in this regard.

Dear Mr. Cummins:

This letter is written in connection with our conversa-

tion on December 22, 1977, in reference to the classification

of correspondence between

the Committee and the Agency.

I have carefully reviewed my letter of December 15, 1977,

which we discussed on Thursday, and have concluded

that it

would be inappropriate to designate the letter as "sensitive",

or to mark it under Section 110 of the Committee's Security

Procedure as material that contains or reveals restricted

material.

I have also carefully reviewed my letter of December 20,

1977, making nine specific requests. It would be appreciated

if you would, in my behalf, designate that letter "sensitive"

Copies held here have been

so designated. As you are aware,

however, the Committee has no lawful authority to classify

any document.

Nevertheless, since item #5 in my letter of

December 20, 1977, is derived from materials designated "Top

Secret", but neither contains nor reveals the contents of said

material, it may be appropriate for the Agency, but not the

Committee, to so classify that item.

Similarly, I have carefully reviewed my letter of Decem-

ber 22, 1977, requesting access

to eleven designated items and

several other files and materials. The paragraph beginning

"Finally" is derived from material designated "Top Secret",

but neither contains nor reveals the contents of said material:

it may, therefore, be appropriate for the Agency, but not the

Committee, to so classify that item.

In the future, letters to you will, where appropriate,

articular requests are so derived from classified materials

trust that this practice will aid in maintaining the in

tegrity of materials the Agency has furnished the Committee.

b. Role of the CIA in the Warren Commission investigation.

on the subject of the assassination and subseguent

investigation.

d. CIA action with regard to FOIA requests and suits.

Finally, we have received additional information con-

cerning item #5 of our December 20, 1977 request. We would like

to clarify the item as follows:
