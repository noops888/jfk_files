Executive Director,

Southern Christian Leadership Conference

latter past

o1 February 1963 mentioned to several officers of

SCLC that he had recently discussad SCLC's Washingion Spring

Project (WS?) with Stanley Levison and Harry Machtel. According

to Rutherford during this discussion consideration vas given to:

one, whether Reverand Martin Luther king,

• JI., President, SCLC,

should endeavor to discuss

with President Lyndon S. Johnsor

problems of Ghetto people; two, the advisability of Reverend

King addressing a joint session

Of Congress

as to problems

and complaints of Ghetto people; and three, whether scLe should

consider legal action against the United States Government for

financial redress to Negroes

based upon the many years the

American Negro has been held in "slavery". Rutherford offered

It was source's understanding that Rutherford vould

discuss these matters subsequently with andrew J. Young,

Concerning the possibility of him

On May 23, 1968, a contidential source advised

that Ralph D. Abernathy,

President, Southern Christian

Leadership Conference (SCLC) had recedly discussed with

several officers of SCLC the inclusion in SCLC's

psople's Calpaign (PPC) of approximately 500 derioan

American pooplo under tho leadership of Reies Lopez

Tijerina.

Andrew J. Young, Executive Vice President,

SCIC, commented he had not

been in lavor from the

beginning of including minority groups in the PPC.

Young obsorved that scuC would not be able to "dictate"

to these people as it has in the past with most Negro

groups with which it has deali. Young said Tijerina

is a very orratic person, extronely strong willed, and

would be expected

for the slightest provocation.

Hilliam A. Rutherford, Executive Direcor, SCIC,

pointed out that Tijerina already had denanded from

SCLC approxinately $2000 expenso money in order to handle

what he clained were anticipated expenses of his own

people. In addition he has denanded other money from

SCLC with which to pay linancial obligations of his

organization, the Alianza Federal De Hercedes. Ruthgriord

said to date that these demands of Tijerina have not

been met by SCLC and so far as he was

awaro Tijerina

will still participate in the PPC.

Young again stressed Tijerina's unpredictable

nature. He said Rudolph Gonzalos possessed an appreciable

ALIANZA FEDERAL DE MERCEDES

(Federal Alliance of Spanish Land

Grant Heirs), (AFDM), also known as Federal

Alliance of Free City States (Alianza

Federal de Pueblos Libres) (FAFCS)

On October 8, 1963, the Alianza Federal de Mercedes (Federal

Alliance of Spanish Land Grant Heirs) (AFDM) filed Articles of Incor-

poration in New Mexico, Its stated purpose was to organize and acquaint

the heirs of all the Spanish Land Grants covered by the Treaty of

Guadalupe - Hidalgo.

PEIES LOPEZ, TIJERINA, 1010 Third Street, N.W.,

Albuguergue, New Mexico, was shon as the president of this organization.

An article in the May 26, 1967, issus of the "Aibuquerque

Journal," a daily newspaper published at

Albuquerque, New Mexico, quotea

REIES LOPEZ TIJERINA as stating that his entire stall of AFDM had

resigned as of April 29, 1967, indicating the AFDM would be replaced

by a

"political

Confederation

of Free City States:"

The "Albuguerque journal" August 20, 1967, issue on page

one carried an article stating that at. a meeting of

the AFDM at

Albuguerque on August 19, 1967, the name of the organization was changed

• to "Federal Alliance of Free City States," (FAECS),. (Alianza Federal de

Pueblos Libres).

The "Albuquerque Journal" on October 17, 1966, in an article

datelined at Abiquiu, New Mexico, related that a group called the

Federal Alliance of Land Grant (Heirs) had staked out a new "republic"

of the Pueblo San Joaquin del Rio de Chama in Northern New Mexico,

elected a town marshal, mayor, and sheriff and fifty

armed men were

deputized

and dared authorities to move them out,

JAMES EVANS, Criminal Investigator, U. S. Forest Service,

Albuquerque, New Mexico, on October 22, 1966, advised that he had

observed

individuals who had identified themselves as members of the

FAFCS seize two Forest Service employees and two Forest Service pickup

trucks.

The records of the U.S. District Court, Albuquerque, New

Mexico, reflect that five of these individuals including REIES

LOPEZ

TIJERINA were arrested on October 26, 1966, charyed with assaulting

a Federal officer and conversion of Government property. On November 11,

1967, REIES IOPEZ TIJERINA and other defendants were found guilty.

The June 6, 1967, issue of the "Albuguerque Journal"

datelined

at Tierra

Amarilla, New Mexico, stated that on June 5, 1967,

members of the AFDN had "blasted" their way into the Tierra Amarilla

Courthouse where members of AFD! were being arraigned on state charges,

wounding a State Policeman and the jailer by gunfire and taking a

'deputy sheriff and a news reporter as hostages.

On October 18, 1967, ROBERT GILLILAND, Criminal Investigator,

New Mexico State Police, Albuquerque, New Mexico, advised that REIES

LOPEZ TIJERINA and some members of the FAFCS met at Canjilon, New Mexicc

on June 5, 1967. On that same date, this group went to. Rio Arriba

County Courthouse at Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico, for the purpose of

taking the menbers of FAFCS who had been arrested on June 2, 1967, on

charges of assembling to do an unlawful act yith force and violence,

away from the New Mexico State officials and the taking of New Mexico

State District Attorney as a prisoner, At tierra

Amarilla they forcibly

held individuals as hostages, shot and wounded a New Mexico State Polic

man, and a Deputy Sheriii of Rio Arriba County and kidnapped another

Deputy Sheriff and one LARRY CALLOWAY, a news reporter.

RECOids of

the First Judicial District, State of New mexico,

at Sánta Fe, New Mexico, as of January 4, 1968, reflect that 20 indivia-

uals, including

REIES LOPEZ TIJERINA, have been charged in State Court on

various counts of kidnapping and assault with intent to commit felonies.

On October 18, 1967, a source advised that PAT BLAU BLAWIS Of

Santa Fe, New Mexico, claims she has been assisting REIES TIJERINA and

the Federal Alliance

of Free City States, formerly known as Alianza

Federal de Mercedes, in their activities. BLAVIS states she is acting

as an

advisor to TIJERINA and claims him as her protege. PAT' BLAU BLeW!!

and REIES TIJERINA are described as individualists and opportunists. and

they are both trying to use the other one to further their own objectivè

TIJERINA undoubtedly would accept assistance and counsel from PAT BLAMIS

but TIJERINA is not controlled by BLAWIS and/or any other individual.

On June 29, 1966, a second source advised that PAT BLAU

BLAVIS had been elected to the National Committee, Communist Party (CP),

USA, at the 18th National Convention of the CP, USA, held in New York

• City June 22-26, 1906.",

A third source on October 17, 1967, and a fourth source on

December 5, 1967, individually advised

that REIES LOPEZ TIJERINA fOr

all intents and purposes is the FAFCS. No one tells PEIES LOPEZ

TIJERINA what to do. He will listen to other persons but makes his

own decisions.

On, February 8, 1968, a confidential source advised

that a meeting of the Executive Board of the Southern

1968, in Washington, D. C., at the Church of the Redeemer, 15th

Direct Action, SCLC, met with Stokely Carmichael of the

Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee

This meeting

was held in the Pitts Motor Hotel, 1451 Belmont Street, N

Washington, D. C.

The essential purpose of Reverend King and

other SCIC

officials meeting with Carmichael was to request

SNCC

not to interfere with Sulc's lashington Spring Project

(Ws) scheduled to commence in early April 1903.

During this meeting, Carmichael was quite congenial

and said neither he nor SNCC would oppose SCLC's WSP.

However,

he stated neither he nor SNCC would be able to join with SCLC

in this project.

can be trusted to not interfere with SCLC's efforts

concerning the WSP.

Reverend King commented to several SCLC officials

that in anticipation of SNCC creating problems (not explained)

for SCLC in'implementing the WSP it might be

very practical

for SCLC to organize "local groups" in Washington, D. C., and

other communities concerned with the wst.. The function.of

these groups, he said, would be to oppose any undesirable activity

on the part of SNCC rather than

require SCLC personnei to divert

their energies from the WSP.

REIES LOPEZ TIJERINA as stating that his entire staif of AFDM had

by a "political Confederation of Free City States."

The "Albuguerque Journal" August 20, 1967, Issue on page

one carried an article stating that at. a meeting of the ArDM at

Albuguerque on August 19, 1967, the name of the organization was

changed

to "Federal Alliance of Free City States," (FAFCS), (Alianza Federal de

Puebios Libres) .

The "Albuquerque Journal" on October 17, 1966, in an article

datelined at Abiquiu, New Mexico, related that a

group

• called the

Federal Alliance of Land Grant (Heirs) had staked out a new "republic"

of the Pueblo San Joaquin del Rio de Chama in Northern New Mexico,

elected a town marshal, mayor, and sheriff and fifty armed men were

deputized and dared authorities to move them out.

observed individuals whe

had identified themselves as members of the

FAFCS seize two Forest Service employees and two Forest Service pickup

members of the AFDM had "blasted" their way into the Tierra Amarilla

Courthouse where members of AFDM were being arraigned on state charges.

wounding a State Policeman and the jailer by gunfire and taking a

deputy sheriff and a news reporter as hostages.

On October 18, 1967, ROBERT GILLILAND, Criminal Investigator,

New Mexico State Police, Albuquerque, New Mexico, advised that REIES

LOPEZ TIJERINA and some members of the FAFCS met at Canjilon, New Mexiço

on June 5, 1967. On that same date, this group went to Rio Arriba

County Courthouse at Tierra Amarilla, New. Mexico, for the

purpose of

taking the members of FAFCS who had been arrested on June 2, 1967, on

charges of assembling to do an unlawful act with force and violence,.

away from the New Mexico State officials and the taking of New Mexico

State District Attorney as a prisoner, At Tierra Amarilla they forcibly

held individuals as hostages, shot and wounded a New Mexico State Police

man, and a Deputy Sheriff of

the Federal Alliance of Fiee City States, formerly known as Alianza

Federal de Mercedes, in their activities. BLAHIS states she is acting

as an aâvisor to TIJERINA and claims him as her protege. PAT BLAU BLANI

and REIES TIJERINA are described as individualists and

opportunists and

they are both trying to use the other one to further their own objective:

TIJERINA undoubtedly would accept assistance and counsel from PAT BLAWIS

but TIJERINA is not controlled by BLAWIS and/or any other individual.

On June 28, 1966, a second source advised that PAT BLAU

BLAWIS had been elected to the National Committee, Communist Party (CP),

TIJERINA what to do: He will listen to other persons but makes his

own decisions.

that the

, "dreamer"

must be continued.

Reverend Ralph D. Abernathy, President, SCLC, was

most

reluctant to assume the leadership of this organization

because

of a lack of self confidence.

Abernathy,

however, 'is determined

to perform his best in this

position until the SCLC annual

convention is held duringthe summer of 1968,

at which time

feels the organization will replace him if his performance is

not adequate.

As of the present time, the SCIC Executive

Staff

1s reasonably united in its desire and effort to continue

with the plans of Reverend King.

A number of the staff have

developed a recent lack of respect and distrust for Jesse

Jackson, Northern Director, Operation Breadbasket, SCLC,

located in Chicago, Illinois. This attitude is based upon

Jackson's actions immediately following the shooting of Reverend

King on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee.

Immediately

following the shooting those SCIC

Executive Staff members who

were in Memphis with Reverend King immediately entered into

a gentleman's agreement that they would return to SCLO National

Headquarters in Atlanta for such discussion and action as might

be necessary.

understood that Coretta King had informed

SCiC that

she could noi in good conscience accapt the $12,000

salaiy which

said

the organization intended to pay her.

She

in all probability in connection vith her elforis

she would appreciale the organication reimbursing

With regard io the declination of Coretta

King to accept the aforementioned

March 21, 1968

The first meeting of the Long Island Peace Council was held in

the Georgian Room of the Garden City Hotel, Garden City L.I.,

New York,

March 19th, 1968 at 8 PM.

The Long Island Peace Council is a coalition of the following

groups and organizations: Women Strike for Peace... Committee

for a Sane Nuclear Policy... United for Peace...

Long Island

catholic Peace Falowship... Social Order of the Unitarian-.

Universalist Church... Women's International League for Peace

and Freedom... Long Island Veterans for. Peace... Long Island High

School Students Mobilizaton... Social Action Committee of C.W.

Post College... Student Peace Union of Hofstra University...

Students for

Democratic Society of Nassau Communtiy College..

and the Jeanette Rankin Brigade.

Seating was 35 deep and 40 across, providing for an audience of

fourteen-hundred people. All seats were occupied.

The meeting was introduced by master of ceremonies DAVE LIVINGSTON,

Local 65 of the AFL-CIO, as an anti-war anti-poverty rally.

The audience was almost one-hundred percent white and predomin-

antly middle-aged.

Aside from standing ovations at the conclusion of the featured

speeches, the audience was quiet, subdued, applauding at appropi-

ate instances, and in other moments laughing lightly. At no time

were there any instances of ill-mannerisms or ill-tempers dis-

played from the floor.

Thre was no picketing either within nor

without the hotel premises.

• Demonstrations of any kind were not

LEN. CHANDLER provided music and song with his guitar and voice.

MOE TANDLER, attorney residing in Great Neck and practicing in

New York City made the pitch for funds from the audience.

It was announced that eight-hundred dollars plus had been

collected.

?

DAVID SHOENBRUN, speaking first, charged that this nation is

engaged in an "cruel, illegal, immoral and un-American war in

Vietnam"

Citing the fact that he was on General EISENHAUERS

staff in World War II and also a close friend to HO CHI MINH,

SHOENBRUN made use of these and other confidences and trusts

to convey the historical facts that preceded back to the days

of President WOODROW WILSON and the Treaty of Versailles

our

present involvement in south-east Asia's Vietnamese War.

SHOENBRUN narrated HO CHI MINH's search for aid beginning with

WOODROW WILSON back in the year 1915 in order to further the lot

of his countrymen.

Rebuffed by WILSON in 1915, and again at the

at the Treaty of Versailles, HO CHI MINH turned to a socialist

friend in Paris who had befriended him, who in turn sent him on

to LENIN in Moscow, Russia.

SHOENBRUN's talk stayed with speci

fics and facts, never deviating until the end when he labeled

General WESTMORELAND as

"incompetent and

should be removed from

his command"

SHOENBRUN declared that we "will not send 200,000 more troops

into Vietnam"

He stated that

"on the record, we are wrong... we

SHOENBRUN added, "but if she is

lush, he would dry her out."

SHOENBRUN asked that the meeting be dedicated... and indeed,

future action dedicated to

"if our country right., OK, if our

country worng, put it right."

He asked for the support of Senator EUGEN

_ NC CARTHY's candidacy

for President of the United States.

During the question and answer period, time allowed for only one

question to SHOENBRUN.

The question asked was

"How the hell do

we get out"

. SHOENBRUNs answer was as follows: 1. Stop bombing

North Vietnam... since bombing

hasn"t stopped infiltration which

has risen from four-hundred infiltrators three years ago to

seventy-thousand infiltrators today... 2. Affirming the fact that

they will talk... 3. If Saigon doesn't want to talk, tell them

either to fight or else we'll pull out... 4. Reconstruet the

parties

present. Hold a two year moratorium and then hold free elections.

5. Build up the South Vietnamese army and then phase out.

ANDREW YOUNG spoke on the upcoming Poor Peoples Campaign to

eradicate poverty in America, a campaign sponsored by the

southern Christian Leadershio Conference under the direction of

the Rev. MARTIN LUTHER KING.

YOUNG noted that this was the second time within a three day

period that he had shared the same rostrum with DAVID SHOENBRUN.

YOUNG also noted that it was specifically because of a single

article written by SHOENBRUN some three years ago which caused

the Rev. MARTIN LUTHER KING and the Southern Christian Leader-

ship Conference to pitch their tents in the peace camp.

In reference to the Poor Peoples Campaign, YOUNG stated simply

that SCLC is merely trying to raise. the issues and confront

America with its hypocrisy... that the SCLC is dealing with

problems of a changing social order... that whites are blinded

to the fact by the racial issue... that even if there were no

blacks, there are still openings for economic revolution.

YOUNG stated that the poverty striken are locked out of the

political structure and have neither the money nor the time to

get in... and that hitting the streets is America's greatest

educational weapon.

YOUNG stated that when problems are taken to the steets on a

consistant, steady basis, it works.

YOUNG stressed that the poor have to disassociate themselves from

administrative policies and live according to their principles...

willing to live or die for

education, housing, employment, etc.

YOUNG noted that poor people from 53 organizations met in Atlanta,

Georgia last Thursday from every race and culture to plan

the

Poor Peoples Campaign.

On the 22nd of April, YOUNG stated that the Rev. KING and aides

will meet with members of Congress and the poor people will be

able to tell about the lives they lead... and how one-quarter of

Americas people are locked out of economy and the decisison

making process.

YOUNG expects 3000 people to converge on Washington about May Ist.

YOUNG stated that he doesn't believe in violence...

that the

black nationalists haven't hurt or killed anybody yet but them

selves.

YoUNG did not express any worry over the possibility of violence.

Nor did he express any fear of President JOHNSON possibly panicking

and going right wing.

Shacks will be erected before the Halls of Congress, HUD, and the

White House to portray living conditions of the poverty striken.

The poor will pray at the nations capitol. The poor will march

and pitch tents where-ever they want to.

A young man by the last name of MESSINGER was introduced to

the assemblage with the announcement that he was going to refuse

induction on the following morning. A plea was sounded for

people to appear at 45 Grace Avenue, Great Neck at 6:15 on the

following morning in order to demonstrate in support of the young

man's stand. MESSINGER was given a round of applause.

A smattering of people left the meeting Illowing SHOENBRUNS

talk.

Following the meeting (also preceeding the meeting) there was

in evidence ample supllies of fliers, circulars, petitions, etc.

all concerned with ending the war in Vietnam. Included on the

tables displaying the literature were numerous paper-back copies

of books dealing specifically with the Vietnamese War (14

different titles in all).

Oakland, California

: Apal 29,'

On Sunday, April 28,1968, at two o'clock pm., the writer attended a

meeting of the Black United Front, at the First Christian Church at 520

Bissell street in Richmond, California.

When the writer arrived there were only two other persons connected

with the B.U.F. there but others began to arrive shortly thereafter.

Before the meeting got underway armed guards were stationed at strategic

places along

the walls and at the doors inside the building, and one

was

locked in the balcony. These guards had their weapons concealed inside

of attache cases that they carried. (This information was told to the

writer in confidence, and the writer saw the weapon of the guard in the

balcony, —it was a .38 revolver with a two inch barrel). After about

thirty peonle had arrived the chairman of the meeting Mamadou Lummumba

(Kenny Freeman) began

the meeting with a short speech. In his speech he

mentioned that this was the second meeting of the B.U.F. and that it was

first formed by Stokley Carmichael in February of 1968, with the purpose

of being a centralized united organization from which all of the varied

black groups or parties will branch. He stressed. the point that unity

must be achieved and that in order to make this possible there must be

communication between all of the organizations. He mentioned the deaths

of Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, and Bobby Hutton, and the imprison-

ment of Huey Newton, Rap Browm, and

Eldridge Cleaver, as examples of how

the "devils" are trying to exterminate our black leaders to keep us from

achieving any type of unity because they know that once we àre unified

they can no longer push us around, and that they are afraid that we might

retaliate for the wrongs that have been perpetrated against us.

After he had spoken for about fifteen minutes he introduced a speaker

from a black citizens council in Pittsburgh, California who spoke of a

NW 55121 DocId: 32989757 Page 116

## Page 117

racial incident that took place at Pittsburgh Senior High School sometime

earlier this year. He sooke of a planned boycott and à show of force

that is to be carried out on Tuesday, April 30, 1968 when the sixteen stud-

ents that were expelled from

school are to have a hearing at that school.

He requested that a delegation from all of the organizations represented

be present for that hearing. Then he introduced an ex-student of that

school, Jerald right, to testify to the climate of racism that exists at

that school between black students and white students, and between black

students and the all white faculty with particular emphasis on the school

principal. A large number of the organizations represented pledged to

send a delegation on Tuesday•

The next speaker was Rev. Andrew Young Joe of the Southern Christian

Leadershio Council, who talked about the role of non-violence in the

black liberation struggle. He talked about Dr. King's ideas and methods

of fighting the racism that has plagued the Negro not only in the south

but in all parts of America. He conmended the B.U.F. on its purpose of

unification of black organizations and the Black Panther Party for its

stand against police brutality in the black community Immediately

after his speech he and his traveling companion Rev. Anderson left the

meeting.

After this chairman Lummumba gave another short speech in which he

stressed the view that the B.U.F. was not formed to dictate to its mem

bers any special technique regarding methods of fighting racism, but that

each member should do watever their individual "thing" is whether it is

a violent or a non-violent method.

Then the chairman began to explain the bylaws of the B.U.T. by sayine

that they were forned by a steering committee of six people besides hir-

Aucher Rol.

Seale told sr. Arthur in a loud voice that he wanted to speak to her.

Then he began to swear at her and told her that she had better keep her

nose out of places where it didn't belong or else something was going to

be done. He told her that he aidn't have time to play her type or games

when there were lives at stake. He said that brothers are dying, and that

he had brothors in jail and brothers on death rove, and that he just didn't

have time for her "jive" games.

Meanwhile she kept saying that she didn't

know what he was talling about. He told her not to stand there and play

like she didn't know what he was talking about because she knew "damed.

good and well" what he was talking about. (It seems that she had made a

public statement threatening Berkeley city councilman Ron Dellums with

some sort of retaliation by the Black Panther Party if he didn't do them

Arthur's husbana came up and tried to tell. Bobby Seale to leave his wife

alone and that she didn't have to listen to that stuff, when he was immead

lately seized by three Panthers but was immediately released when Bobby

Seale commanded them to and reminded them that he had told them not to

move until he moved. Then he told Mrs. Arthur that he had told her before.

and he was telling her now to mind her own business and keep her nose out

of Party business and not to come around the Panther office again, and

this was the last time that he was going to tell her. He said that her big

mouth was the reason that she was kicked out of the Black Panther Party by

Newton, Cleaver, and himself. Then he whirled and walked out with his Pan-

thers following him.

When order was finally restored, a motion was made that the B.U.F. re-hac

cognize the Black Panther Party as a political party, and it was passed

with no opposition. The flor was then opened to ideas concerning amend-

ments and additions to the bylaws. and purposes of the B.U.F. Among the

suggestions was one by a sister representing an organization in San Jose

that we form some type of training class to teach our black women how to

shoot weapons and how to protect thonselves and defend their homes "like

these white women are doing". There was a lot of head nodding and indivia-

ual verbal exclamations of affirmation but no formal action was proposed

or taken by the B.U.F. There were suggestions of setting up classrooms in

churches to tutor black children in all points of formal education. A law-

yer that was present said that he would soliait 1,000.00 dollars from his

associates to be turned over to the B.U.F. for whatever necessary expenses

they had.

The last speaker was Bro. Larry Thomas Co-ordinator of High School

Black Student Unions•

Bro. Thomas told of a planned boycott of Housewives

Following Bro. Thomas' talk a motion for adjournment was entertained ans

passed, and the meeting was adjourned until May 12,1968 at the same place.

There were about 65 persons present at the end of the meeting. The

writer recognized the presence of Ernie Allen who goes by the name of
