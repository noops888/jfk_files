At BOMPENSIERO's residence on 1/15/70, the latter

told informant that it is imperative that he go to Las Vegas

to see YALE COHEN. Informant stated that BOMPENSIERO's reason

for seeing COHEN has nothing to do with any of BOMPENSIERO'S

business with SIMPONIS or informant.

BOMPENSIERO told informant

COHEN wanted him to see

a man near

Cucamonga, California, and

he, BOMPENSIERO, has not been able to locate this person.

On the morning of 1/27/70, BOMPENSIERO telephonically

advised' informant that he has no choice but to go to Las Vegas

on 1/29/70, to see COHEN.

He requested informant drive him

from Los Angeles to Las Vegas for that purpose.

On the night of 1/28/70, BOMPENSIERO telephonically

instructed informant to pick him up at the Los Angeles Inter-

•national Airport, PSA Terminal, 11:00 a.m., 1/29/70, which

informant did.

They immediately departed via informant's

automobile to Las Vegas.

On 1/30/70, informant advised that he and BOMPENSIERO

arrived at Las Vegas approximately 5:30 p.m. the previous day..

Informant located

SIMPONIS in the card room at the Star Dust

Hotel and obtained

the key to SIMPONIS's room in that hotel.

At BOMPENSIERO's instructions, informant tried unsuccessfully

to contact

"PEANUTS" DONALFO.

He then contacted YALE COHEN

by telephone.

BOMPENSIERC requested COHEN meet him at

SIMPONIS'

room which the latter did within ten minutes.

After usual greeting, informant excused himself and left them

alone.

BOMPENSIERO subsequently told informant that a

close friend of his named JOHN, had sent him to see COHEN to

-get COHEN to make an appointment for JOHN with one of the top,

owners of

the Star Dust Hotel, who BOMPENSIERO identified to

informant

as MOE GENSER.

San Diego has advised that JOHN is

actually JOHN ROSELLI and that hewants a sitdown; meeting

with MOE DALITZ.

Informant advised BOMPENSIERO did not co

into further detail but told him that the less he knew about

this matter the better off he would be because it is a very

sensitive and

serious situation.

very tired from their travel, he had to contact several people

before getting any rest in connection with the meeting between

COHEN, JOHN, and MOE.

on 3/2/70, SD 1064-C-TE returned from Los Angeles

and advised by telephone as follows:

Following instructions from Los Angeles ICN hoodlum

ROSELLI, he met him at 2:00 p.m., on 3/1/70, at the Hyatt

House, Beverly and Rodeo, Beverly H1lls, California.

Hotel in a white Cadillac.

DALITZ and COHEN then met ROSELLI and informant at

the Hyatt House. ROSELLI did not want to talk there and

suggested they all move on to the Brown Derby Restaurant

nearby.

Informant advised that ROSELLI thereafter informed

Las Vegas to HOWARD HUGHES.

DALITZ immediately objected to

ROSELLI's statement claiming that he had anything to do with

the sales.

ROSELLI insisted on continuing

ROSELLI told

DALITZ that it was through his efforts DALITZ was allowed to

remain on in the management of the Stardust and Desert Inn

after it was sold to HUGHES which allowed DALITZ and his

group to continue highly profitable skimming operations on

markers. ROSELLI claimed that during the pre-sale negotiations

he was

present with GEORGE GORDON and MORRIS KLEINMAN, and that

he (ROSELLI) was supposed to get $60,000 per month from the

time of the sale until the time DAlliZ and his group left the

management of

the hotel.

ROSELLI indicated that he received none of this

money.

He also indicated that this $60,000 a month due him

was not for people but that he also had to distribute some

, nodding toward the informant. ROSELLI

indicated that as a result of his efforts, DALITZ was able to;

sell the Desert Inn and Stardust at a high price and still

continue to skim money from markers owed.

ROSELLI explained •

that he was now short of money as a result of continued

legal pressure and two recent convictions in Federal Court.

ROSELLI ended up by saying that DALITZ received an extra one

million dollars from the sale of these hotels as a result of

his efforts.

Informant advised that thereafter, DALITZ denied

having any knowledge of any agreement with ROSELLI regarding

given instructions to contact ROSELLI in California and not

in Miami.

By this time, ROSELLI realized that it was useless

talking to LA PORTE, and they left, dropping ROSELLI off at

Beverly and La Cienege Boulevards.

unroute back to san Diego, LA PORIE indicated

that TONY ACCARDO had no use for ROSELLI, and that ROSELLI

had lost his power with the Chicago ICN when former Boss SAM

GIANCANA left. Chicago LCN will not pay for ROSELLI's legal

expenses.

LA PORTE left for Chicago on American Airlines

Flight 62, on 4/8/70.

On 4/9/70, LA 4412-C-TE advised that on the pre-

vious night, he had

received a telephone call from FRANK

BOMPENSIERO, who was calling from San Diego.

At this time,

BOMPENSIERO told informant that he has to take a guy who is a

"big man from east"

to court in Los Angeles on 4/12/70, ano

that man must catch a plane from San Diego to

Chicago later

in the day.

On 4/7/70, San Diego 1064-C-TE advised that he would

be in Los Angeles on 4/7/70.

Subsequently, the same morning, San Diego 1064-C-TE

advised

that he was driving FRANK LA PORTE (LCN Capo from

Chicago) to Los Angeles for a meeting with JOHN ROSELLI,

and Attorney JAMES CANTILLON's office at noon.

OZZIE CURTIS Of LOS Angeles, who Is a cousin of Mrs. SARI

POSNER, originally came to informant and stated that his

cousin, Mrs. POSNER, some time ago, was divorced from her

husband, and at the

time of the divorce, was awarded a sum

of money, which had been agreed upon in a premarital contract.

However,

subsequent to the marriage, Mr.

POSNER, who resides

in Florida, had become worth an estimated $500,000,000, whereas

when he was married,

his estimated wealth was approximately

$40,000,000. " Source then contacted ROSELLI for a recommenda-

tion for an attorney in Miami who could represent Mrs. POSNER

to get the premarital property agreement nullified and obtain

a much greater sum of money from Mr. POSNER.

ROSELLI recommended

an attorney named FRANK REGANO

of Miami. An agreement was then made by the Informant,

that Mrs. POSNER would receive fifty

percent of any additional money received in a settlement, and

the remaining fifty percent would be split in half and half

would go for REGAN and SANTO TRAFFICANTE, and the other

remaining

25 percent would go to the informant and would be

split three

ways between OZZIE CURTIS, JOHN ROSELLI, and the

informant.

Informant advised that he would expect

the settle.-

ment to be not less than. $25,000,000, and the share he would

receive, to be split with ROSELLI and CURTIS, he estimated

would be in the neighborhood of $3,000, 000.

On 3/27/70, source advised that he received a

telephone call earlier that morning from FRANK REGANO, who

aavised that on the previous night, 3/26/70, the Florida

Superior Court made a ruling, which in effect, permitted the

premarital property settlement to be judged individually,

therefore, there was a chance for him to now go into court

and seek the SARI POSNER premarital agreement be nullifiea,

and a settlement made according to the wealth of her husband,

at the time of the divorce.

Gifts Galore, Incorporated

paying back VINNIE for her interest.

FRIEDMAN says that

VINNIE got a $20,000 check from BREEN at the time he purchased

her interest.

While SHAFIRO was still at the Frontier, he

told VINNIE DONATO to. let a person named NORMAN ALLEN put a

jewelry counter in her gift shop, and she was required to do

this which resulted in loss of money to her because he was

there a short time and ran up bills, and also had charge

accounts from customers at the hotel which were not paid and

that she was stuck with.

On 4/14/70, MAURICE FRIEDMAN advised SA WAYNE W.

HILL, and SA HAROLD F. DODGE that three or four months ago,

while on a plane, he met the head of International Hosts.

During the conversation,

this man, whose name FRIEDMAN did

not recall, told FRIEDMAN that International Hosts was in-

terested in buying Gifts Galore, Incorporated for ten times

the yearly earnings.

FRIEDMAN stated that he estimated the

yearly earnings to be $25,000 to $30,000.

FRIEDMAN subsequently called HARRIET HAMILTON, who

is a member of a law and accounting firm, which represents

ROSELLI, and told her about this offer,

and asked her to

contact

her client to see if her client wanted to sell Gifts

Galore, Incorporated, on the above terms.

Later, HARRIET HAMILTON advised FRIEDMAN that her

client was not interested.

FRIEDMAN stated that he estimated the gross income

of Gifts. Galore, Incorporated,

to be about $600,000 per

year.

on 3/14/70, LV 211-PC advised SA M. B. PARKER that

he had seen ROSELLI in Los Angeles approximately two weeks

prior to 3/14/70, and informant stated that ROSELLI was

broke and had borrowed money from everyone he could.

Infomant stated ROSELLI had a lease on Gifts

Galore,

Incorporated, shop in the Frontier Hotel, which he

secured when the hotel was owned by the previous

owners

such as JACK SHAPIRO, et al, and was secured to MAURICE

FRIEDMAN, who built the Frontier.

which owns the Frontier Hotel, has had numerous lawyers re-
