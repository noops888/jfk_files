Dear Walt:

This letter will confirm verbal requests made by Mr.

of the Senate Select Committee staff to Mr.

garding materials pertaining to the assassination of President

Kennedy.

1. The Senate Select Cornittee requests a listing of all Mexico

City Station personnel for the period of September through

Int December 1963. The Committee requests this.list on an access

basis only, to be retained at the CIA for use by the Committee

staff.

2. The Senate Select Committee requests clarification on what

documents were filed in the Oswald 201 as of November 22, 1963.

Both Mr. Hartman and Mr. Wall, CI Staff, have stated there were

five documents in the file:

two Department of State Foreign Dis-

patches FS Dispatch #806 dated May 5, 1961 and FS Dispatch $317

dated December 12, 1961); one Office of Naval Intelligence memor-

andum (May 26, 1962 from H. T. Hadenberg) ; and two FBI Reports.

Mr. Hartman stated the FBI Reports were reports of SA John Fain.

dated August 30, 1962 and July 3, 1961. Mr. Wall stated the

FBI Reports were an October 31, 1963 Report of SA Milton Kaack

LA

3.

(a).. Cable traffic from JMWAVE Station to Headquarters fol-

Lowing the President's assassination reveals that JMAVE's file

contained information on Lee Harvey Oswald. For example, WAVE 8049

(IN 66782) , November 22, 1963, states that AMSPELL files (Cubar

Student Directorate of JMWAVE have background information or

Oswald.

The Senate Select Committee requests access to Cuban

Student Directorate files of JMWAVE that contain information on

Oswald.

(b)

The presence of information on Oswald in AMSPELL files

Of INHAVE suggests the possibility that JWAVE files on other

Cuban exile groups might contain information on Oswald.

was instructed by Headquarters to review its files for informa-

tion on Oswald and if JMIAVE files on Cuban groups contain. any

information about Oswald. The Senate Select Committee requests

access to JWAVE files on Cuban groups that contain such informa-

tion:
