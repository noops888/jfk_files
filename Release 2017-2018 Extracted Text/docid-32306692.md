MARGE HOOVER also told the informant her date was prearranged by

CARMEN "HAM" CLEMENT, bartender at the Ovalon Club in Hazleton. She also

said ROGEPS was

snowbound at Genetti's Hotel in Hazleton during the snow-

storm the week end of February 18, 1958, and while there he called her and

wanted her to come out to the hotel and spend the night with him. She

stated she declined because of what he had told her about BUFALINO.

He said she resides at 585 Manhattan Court, Hazleton, where she lives with
