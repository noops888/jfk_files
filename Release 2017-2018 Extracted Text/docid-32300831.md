LA 92-113 C

IA 4268-C has furnished the following information:

On 8/14/64, ROSSELLI was not at the Friars Club.

on 8/17/64, ROSSELLI was at the Friars Club and

told informant that he had sold his Pontiac Grand Prix

and he is now driving KATHY'S (KATHY HORDEN) car. He said

he was not going to buy another car at this time. _ HERMAN

SPITZEL was at the Friars Club. SPITZEL related that he

had recently been at the Del Mar races and resided at the

Torrey Pines Motel.

ROSSELLI was at the Friars Club on 8/18 and 19/64,

but nothing of unusual interest occurred.

on 8/20/64, ROSSELLI arrived at the Friars Club

about 6:00 p.m. and while there received a telephone call.

After he hung up, ROSSELLI asked informant if he could get

three tickets to the Beatles performance in Los Angeles on

Sunday, 8/23/64. ROSSELLI said he just received a call

Irom a very important person in the Democratic Party, who

is close to President JOHNSON, who

wanted three tickets

for his children. ROSSELLI said,

"You wouldn't believe

¡t if I told you who it was"

Informant endeavored to get

three tickets for ROSSELLI without success.

At this time, BILL SMITH, an official at 20th

Century Fox Studios came to the Friars Club and ROSSELLI

asked

him if he could get three tickets. SMITH said he

would try to do so.

On 8/21/64, ROSSELLI arrived at the Friars Club

at about 5:00 p.m. with MOE GENSER. A few minutes later

BILL SMITH, above mentioned, came in and delivered three

tickets to

the Beatles performance to ROSSELLI.

The cost

of the tickets was $30, which ROSSELLI offered to pay, but

SMITH declined to accept the money. SMITH said he was

waiting to take HERMAN SPITZEL to dinner.

ROSSELLI told JONIE TAPS, a Columbia Pictures

employee, to call KATHY and tell her to come down to the

Friars Club. TAPS did so and when he returned, told ROSSELLI

that he was to call HARLEY HARMON at Newport Beach and gave

ROSSELLI

a number to call. ROSSELLI said it looked like a

wrong number,

but made the call and it turned out to be the

wrong number for HARMON. HARMON is a close associate of

ROSSELLI, who is in the insurance and banking business in

Las Vegas.
