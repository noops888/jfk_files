become a police state and that Cuban authorities have the

family. "all tied up." ROJAS and his wife toldiEr 19ufthat

a Cuban communist named JUAN MARINE is a friend of the family.

On one trip to Cuba, CACHITA ROJAS asked him to look into the

situation of her sister TERESA PROENZA to see how it could

be straightened out.

MARINE recently visited Mexico "incognito"

and informed the ROJAS that the situation now is extraordinarily

good but that TERESA was once under a death sentence because

she had dealt with LEE HARVEY OSWALD while assigned to the

Cuban Embassy priorito the assassination of JOHN F. KENNEDY.

Her fiends_interceded for her and her life was spared. ROJAS

told cY 197* that MARINE warned them not to tell the Cuban

Embassy

The source stated that JORGE ROJAS and his wife

do not know how to cope with the present situation. They

fear going to Cuba and they are speaking out against the Cuban

revolution in a most forthright manner.

The source statea that some years ago, as best he

could recall, he heard JUANA LUISA PROENZA, a sister of CACHITA

who died some years ago, telling a similar story of how TERESA

PROENZA was somehow involved with LEE HARVEY OSWALD at the

Cuban Embassy.. At the time TERESA was employed at the embassy,

she lived with JUANA LUISA and another sister.

Within the

tamily it has always been said that JUANA LUISA Worried hersell

to death after Masa was ordered to Cuba. (k)

The Mexico City Office has conducted a review of

references to TERESA PROENZA especially those dealing with

OSWALD investigation and it is noted that as set forth in

Mexico City letter to the Bureau 1/24/64 in the OSWALD case

MUch 18 and MEX 19* both of whom have furnished reliable infor-

mation in the past, reported on 1/13/64 that they had conversed

While

it is not clear

Iron available incornation,

it would appear

that PROINZA was able to return from Cuba

for a visit to

Mexico following her disnissal and departure

in "1/54.

By report

nated-1/14/55 the CIA reported on

the in-

vestigation by the Cuban governnent of old line communist

JOAQUIN CROOQUI MASA.

"In this report it was indicated that

TERESA PROSNEA had been

arrested at hes homes ang-wes-pelle,

held incommunicado

i

A review of the foregoing material indicates that

TERESA PRONZA got into trouble with the Cuban government more

as a result of her criticism of the handling of the OSWAlu

matter following the assassination of President KENNEDY than

because

anything she did when CSWALD visited the Cuban

Embassy.

Fer harsh criticisn of high Cuban officials (the

Ambassador

• and Toreign Minister) was apparently well known

in the embassy and hardly helped ner case. at rails to

indicate that she did anything for (SWALD that yould substantiate)

the remarks made by JORGE DOJAS and his wife tomlax l970that!

PURESA PROENZA had nearly been erecuted because of her activities

during OS"ALD's visit

to the Cuban Imbassy in 1983 In the

absence of additional information regarding this activity,

no

further investigation is contemplaied at this time.

It is

noted that it is not feasible to directly interrogate JORCE

ROJAS or his wife.

Rowever swEr 197 will closely follow this

matter with then and any additional, significant developments

will be called prompily to the attention of the Bureau. (X)-
