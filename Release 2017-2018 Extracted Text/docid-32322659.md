Title: ASSASSINATION MATERIAL DISCLOSURE ACT

Synopsis: JFK Task Force returning file(s) to Phoenix.

Details: Enclosed for Phoenix are the following file(s) :

PX 80-2-340

PX.80-0-2807

The originals removed from these files and replaced

with duplicate copies of the original were accessioned to the

National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) pursuant to

the JFK Records Collection Act of 1992. Provision of the JFK Act

allowed for certain information to be postponed from public

release until the year 2017; therefore, the pages have NOT

necessarily been released for public review in their entirety.

Under the JFK Act, originals to all material deemed

assassination records must be accessioned to NARA regardless of

whether the material is open in full or released with information

postponed.

Therefore, any documents or pages from FBI files

accessioned to NARA pursuant to the JFK Act are no longer

considered the possession of the FBI. The duplicate pages have

been inserted strictly for research purposes.

The copies contained within the previously mentioned

file(s) do not necessarily show the most up-to-date

classification.
