there 15 no question in reading the documents that I read this

morning, which I had not seen in the batter part of fifteen

years, that a man did go out from Headquarters and was provided

with material which you mentioned and had a discussion along

these lines with the Chlot of station.

of Station without furthar rafarance to Headquartara to set

about assaasinating Lumumba.

In your answers that we have just reviewed in

your first examination, you indicated that you had no knowleru

of a mission by.

Dr. Gottlias to the congo and that there was

nothing in your experlance in the Agency that would really bear

on the question whather such a mission was undertaken or what

the character of it was.

Has the review of the documents torlay refreshed your

that Dr. Gottliab went to the Congo.

I was marely tolling you, at that time, what I could

remembar, and there was an awful lot that l Ald not and do not.

Mr. Baron. To move to the perior when you were Chlef of

the Africa Division and Richard Bissell was DDP in the sumer

6

of 1960, did you have conversations with Richard Bissell where

the subject of the assassination of lumumba arose?

8

MI. Twoody, Yes, I did, In lace, the first conversation,

9

as I recall it, that I ever had on the subject was one he

1.:

initiated with me, and, as I think I told you, I do not recall

axactly what was sald, but there was no question about lt but

what Mr, Bissall was saying to me was that thare was agreement.

i policy agrooment in Washinaton, that. Lumumba must be remover

from the position of control and influance in the congo or that

: 6

the Corgo was going to be in serious trouble and thus Africa,

at that stago of its development; and that among the possibil

i:: ities of that elimination was indeed assassination.

In turms of the dotail of that conversation with Mr. Hissell.

i: I redlly cannot go ary further chan that.

This certainly was

the sist of it.

i.:

Mr. Baros. Was Mr. Biasell ary more gpecific at any poi:.t

with you about the policy level where the consideration to

:..

assagsinate Lumunha had been marle?

:r, Tweedy. No, sir. Tha most authoritative statement u:

::that was a cable that went out to the field from the Director.

Ms. Dallas, which implind to me there was pollay agreement in

however, 'it was perfectly clear that the Agancy felt that it

had some aort of policy consensus in Hashington about the need

for the renoval of Lumumba. When I say removal, I mean by

Mr. Tweedy.

I suspect, again I cannot be sure, I guspect

The Chairman. Thank you.

Mr. Baron. In your talke with Mr. Dissell, where the

subjact of the assassination of Lumumba was raised in any

5

fashion. did Mr. Biesell move

from this general laformition

6

to you that the subject had been opened at very high lavels

to asking you to procoad to axplore means to getting access to

6

Lumumba for the purpose of assassinating him?

Mr, Tweedy. The purpose of his conversation with me was

to Initlate correspondence with the Station for then to explore

:: with Headquarters the possibility

of this, that la assassina-

tion, or

indeed any other means of

ranoving Lumumba from power.

!: In other words, the purpose of the axercise was to tall the

:: Station what Headquarters had in mind, aiving it some idea o!

i' the policy hackground

of it, and than to have the station

start reviowing possibilitias, assets, and discussirg them with

i: Headquarters in detail in the same way that we would with any

overation, whether it was as

sansitive as this, or loss s0.

It was, in other words, the initiation of quite normal

: operational dialoque between loadquarters and the field, apar:

from the fact that it was

an unusual subiact.

Mr. Baron. At some noint after the serias of conversatious

:. With Richard Bissell, did you have a conversation with dianes
