ATTACHMENT TO 10 MARCH 1998 MEMORANDUM RE: CIA-IR-36

1.

Per the Review Board staff's request the following

is a brief explanation of how the Directorate of Operations

(DO) processed cables in the 1963/1964 time-frame. As we

are unable to locate any definitive records on the subject,

and in all probability none ever existed, the information

provided is based solely on the memory of DO officers

familiar with procedures in place at the time.

2.

Each area division in the DO maintained and staffed

its own registry.

Although each registry was configured to

meet each division's unique requirements, there were common

functions performed by all the registries to include:

collecting, sorting,

and delivering of incoming cables;

maintenance of incoming and outgoing cable "chronos";

collecting and delivering of incoming and outgoing pouch

material; and

the issuance and maintenance of "pseudo and

alias" card files.

3. To the specific question regarding processing of

cables, on a daily basis, usually six day per week, each

registry collected its incoming cable traffic from

a central

processing point, called the Cable Secretariat, an office

within the Office of the Director prior to its transfer to

the Office of Communications, Directorate of Support in

February 1972. The incoming cables were then sorted by

registry personnel according to pre-defined guidelines.

These guidelines were unique to each division and were

frequently altered to meet changing operational

requirements.

Sorted cables were then delivered to specific

cabies wage then

operational/area desks.

A "chrono" copy of each was

maintained, on a temporary basis, usually for 90 days and

then destroyed.

4.

Outgoing cables were created and coordinated by

appropriate operational/area desks

and usually released by

the chief of the division or a designated releasing officer.

"Released" cables were then hand delivered or sent by

pneumatic tube system ( a system long ago dismantled from

the original Headquarters building) to Cable Secretariat for

processing into the Agency's communication network.

"Chrono" copies of outgoing cables were forwarded to the

registry for a 90 day hold and then destroyed.

5. It is important to note that the cable scenario

outlined here

is general in nature and that throughout their

existence registries and their procedures were frequently

altered until the registry system as described above was

eliminated in the mid-1980's.
