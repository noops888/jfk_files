ABSTRACT

MICROFILM

Hestoration of citizenship

for ANCLATTER-1

Action Required: For information of office of General Counsel

As a follow up to conversations between Robert K. TROUCHARD, Terence S.

CRABANAC and the Office of General Counsel concerning present atterpta to

regain for AMCLATTER-1 his lost American citizenship, TROUCHARD met

ANCLATTER-1 on a4 August. TROUCHARD explained

that ve were seeking a basis

for an administrative type of review of his case and needed any recome which

he might nave, such as notices from ODACID concerning his loss of citizen-

Bhip, notices

from his attorneys in his attempts to regain citizenship

and copies of any pertinent correspondence.

The objective ia to determine 11

his citizenship can be restored ithout his having to leave the countay,

return in an lamigrant status, and vait for a period of five years.

2.

AMCIATTER-1 stated that he had nothing in writing since he hed to leave

PBRUNE surreptivlously. He could only add the folloving commentary to those

records which were already in ODACID or ODURGE files:

recollection, the paragraph of the Nationality Act (he belleves 1t to be

Bection 5) by which he was separated from his citizenship status stited thet

before procedure can be taken to remove anyone's citizenship he mist have

prior notification that such procedure is being contemplated and be all med

to express his side of the question; AMULATTER-l states that he vas never

called in to be questioned, but received an after-the fact notifieation 1n

writing that le wus no longer an American citizen. At this same time, hos

ever, he states that he vas a constant visitor at ODACID where he had vorked

In close cooperation with the ODENVY office and his address was on record

with ODACID so that he could be reached easily at any time.

The efforts of the office of General Counsel and ODURGE representatives

In this matter are greatly appreciated.
