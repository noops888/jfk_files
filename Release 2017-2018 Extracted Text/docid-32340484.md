NOTE:

Esquire magazine carried article dealing with

captioned movement which is involved in efforts to separate

Abaco (in the Bahamas) from the Bahamas.

We have been aware

of these efforts for some time.

Isquire magazine in February,

1975, carried article dealing with this matter and cited a

number of individuals involved including Mitchell Werbell who

is well known as an arms dealer.

Among other things, the

article indicated training of some Abaco people was going on

near Atlanta and that a forward headquarters had been set up in

The interested offices have been alerted and in the

we obtain any pertinent data it will appropriately

disseminated to the interested agencies including

MI-5.
