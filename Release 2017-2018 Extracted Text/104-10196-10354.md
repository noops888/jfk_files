will be difficulti for him to get a visa for Cuba, because he

because he knew it would require waiting a long time for his

visa to the Soviet Union while in Cuba, and from there go to

the Soviet Union. The Soviet said the thing is that if his

These have not been

included in this summary because thoy appear!

on review, to be excludable from the OSWALD matter on logical or

substantive grounds, or both, bearing in mind that the soviet Embassy

roccive many calls pertaining to visa matters:

the consul was not in'and to call back at 1130.. OSWALD is known to

have arrived at the Flech, Roja bus terminal on bus 8516 at

ca. 1000 on the 27th.. It was, therefore, possible for him to have

made this call. ranting this, it

coms unrcasonable to belleve

the calls were OSWAlD's for the following rcasons:

a. The caller wanted visas, and specifically for Odessa.

OswAlD was sceking a visa and never in any fither context did

he specify the Black-Sea port of Odessa as a destination.*

b. The call was directed to the correct soviet consular

number: 15-60-55. On tha Wil October, OSWALD first called

the wrong

number, 15-69-87 (the MA's number), and had. to

redirect his call to the correct number, 15-60-55. It seems

unlikely he would have made what would have been his initial

call, on Friday the 27th, to the correct number, and called

the incorrect number on 1 October.

c. There is every reason to bellove from the context of

the intercepts.

a through e above that OSWALD's first destina-

tion after arrival and check-in to his hotel, was a visit to

the Cuban Embassy.

d. The use of the Spanish language would exclude OSWALD

unless he made use of an intermediary, which seems unlikely

for what 1s known of his modus operands.

1ộ. Summing up, ve can state, or reasonably infer from the

evidence, that OSWALD made the following contacts with the Cuban

and

soviet official establishments in Mexico City.

a. 27 September 1963 (Friday). After arrival and check-in

to his hotel, OSWALD went first to the Cuban Imbassy, where he

talked with Mrg. Silvia DURAN. The time of his first Cuban

Embassy visit is unknown. The time of his socond Cuban Embassy

visit was about 1600 (i.e:, just before closing) .

Sometime

between

the two Cuban Embassy

visits,

at Mrs. DÚRAN's indica-

tion, he must have visited the Soviet Enhassy.

talked with at the Soviet Embassy.

There

was no

photographic coverage of OSWALD's entries into either the Cuban

or Soviet Embassies on the 27th. The lack of coverage on the

Cuban installation

is explainable: the camera, based on the

recollection of officers still in service in Headguarters, was

Photographic coverage was normally suspended Sacurdays and

sundays. OSWAZD, notwithstanding the holidayschedule, went

on Saturday morning to the Soviet Embassy (his second visit)

where he spoke to a consul. He apparently. could not recall

his new

Texas

address.

At ca. 1l51 he went to the Cuban

Embassy--his third entry--where he had registered it in his

visa application the day previousty." He secured the

address

from Mrs.. DURAN and she called the Soviet Consulate presumably

to permit him to give them the address

over the phone.

Instead, the Soviet with whon OSWALD spoke over Mrs. DURAN'S

telephone invited OSWALD to come back in person, and he said he

would!

c. I retober 1963 Muesdax?. OSWALD made aè lease iro

calls, at 1031 and 1075, to the soviet embissy. He identified

himself twice during the setend call when he talked with

OBYEDIKOVa guard--and referred to his talk on Saturday,

motebketinthere would have been no reason for him to go to the

Embassy:

His case had clearly been placed at the sufferance

of the USSR Embassy in Washington. His two calls on 1 October

were concerned with whether any reply had been received from

Washington. Under these circinstances i hibasight it is

unreasonable to believe OSkaLD would have gone to the Soviet

Embassy on thaT date.

With this conmuniortion the matter of the

"unidentified individual" reaches the end of Phase !,

the key

element of which is the conviction at first lutent, then

expressede that the photouraphed individual might be identical

with OSWALD. This appligg especially to the station, though

at a certain point even Headguarters moved no rebuttal despite

Milanen'

all items in the case record that have a-bearing on what

happened.

The operational zeal, innovativeness and the high

committment of all involved, especially in Mexico City, speaks

for itself. Equally apparent - because of the 20 - 20 advantage

of hindsight - is the evidence of non-performance. It was

a critical failure, for example, that no photo of OSWALD was

made available - though it was expressly requested both at

Headquarters and by the field - or that it was not more

aggressively sought by CIA, before the twenty-second of November.

A photograph of OSWALD would have

obviated - in a way

the mere

possession of a correct physical evidently could not - the whole

23 November 1963 shored one of the six photos flown up from

Mexico City the previous day to OSWALD's mother, Marguerite OSWALD.

ODUM himself had trimmed the off the background by

shows the unidentified individual

in a black shirt. It was one of the five photos taken of him

in front of the Soviet Embassy in Mesico City on 4 October 1963,

two days after OSWALD had left the city.

41.

At this point for the record the total available

photo coverage of the unidentified individual numbers twelve

photographs:

42.

The result of ODUM's display of the photogräph - to

repcat, a cropped version of one of those noted under paragraph 4lb,.

above - was Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD's allegation that she had

been shown a picture of her son's killer, Jack RUBY, & day"

before he perpetuated the deed! Again the Warren Commission

Report. (pp. 364. - 365, 367) exhaustively disposes of this

ertoncous charge and requires no repetition here. A complicating

fact developed along the way was

Mrs. OSWALD's (correct) obser-

vation when she finally admitted

before the Commission that

the ODUM photograph was not RUBY, was that the photo had been

cropped differently from the one she had been show in Dallas.

Inspector MALLEY's cropped version of the ODUM photograph

became Commission Exhibit 237 (see HEARINGS, Vol. XVI, p. 638).

The net effect of the developments in the 1

of the Commission was to require the admission of the cropped

and ME. HELMS, who depreed for the originator.

These docu-

ments speak for themselves and will be found in the

HEARINGS, VOI. XI, pp. 168- 470.

-44.. Mexico City Station and other senior Agency officers

strongly advised against the publication of the photograph in

any. form on the grounds that the soviets would be innediately

alerted to the exifence of a useful and continuing U.S.

intelligence operation and the operation would go down the

drain. There were repeated cables exchanged

on this point

between Headquarters and Mexico City Station during

the

summer of 1964 in particular from 23 September to 15 October 1964

when the Statior had plans underway to abandon the operation.

In acceding to the Commission's request for a deposition

ME. HELMS, then the Deputy Directos ló plans, replied affirmatively

to MI.. RANKIN by memorandum of 23 June 1964 which including

the following additional observation:

"The Central Intelligence Agency recommends

that this photograph not be reproduced in the

Commission's

report because it would

jeopardize a most confidential and productive

operation.

In addition, it could be embarrassing

to the individual involved who as far.

as the

Agency is

aware had no connection with

assassination of

46.

Iri this instance the needs

of the Commission prevailed

over the DCI's statutory obligation to protect sources and

methods.

The "Unidentified Individual" remains to. this day

unidentified and there is no credible evidence up to this

time to rebut the assertion made by Mr. HELM's in the concluding

sentence of his memorandum. to Mr. RANKIN On 23 June 1964 •P

And the photo operation did, as predicted, go down the drain.

Within a week of the public appearance of the ODUM Exhibit

No. I and Commission Exhibit 237, members of the Soviet Embassy

began systematic efforts to survey

the surrounding buildings,

ostensibly for rental space, but clearly their inquiries

were directed to spotting possible camera sites. The operation

was continued in any case. Within a year it had become almost

totally unproductive in coveraye on Americans in contact with

PHASE THRES: #THE"UNIDENTIFIED MAN" PHOTOGRAPHS, 1964 - 1975

It as could be foreseen there has been persistent pressure by

critics of the Warren Cormission Report to exploit abe ODUN Exhibit Nol

and Commission Exhibit No. 237 for partisan interpretive purposes.

A considerable correspondence has accumulated since the end of

1964 in which the Agency has attempted to be Icsponsive to Chese

requests(sirultaneously; to satisfy what has been

sole interest

from the inception of the matter: to protect the method of

acquisition of the photograph and the

Tie following is guate

from Mr. Houston's memorandum:

"Because of the publiciey alaud has surrounded

the Orleans Pariah Grand Jury proceedings, we have

recently carried out an exaustive search of the

files of the Central Intelligence Agency for any

picture of Lee Harvey Oswáld taken in Mexico. As

a result of this search,. I can state categorically

thät the files of this Agency do not contain, and

never have contained, any such picture of

Lee Harvey Or wald taken in lexico and that we have

no information whatsoever that any such photograph

ever existed. To the best of our knowledge and

• information, therefore, there is no such photograph.

Furthermore, the photograph which is printed in the

Warren Commission Report, Sxhibit No. 237 in

Volume XVI, never contained more than one figure,

and the figure in the photograph depicts an indi-

vidual who, to our knowleage, has not been identified.

The

circunstgáces of the filing of thie photograph

with the Warren Commission are see forth in affidavits

pages 468 and 169 of Volume MI, Hearings Before the

President's Commission on the Assassination of

President Kennedy. Conseqsently, le have no record

of any photograph that ansters in ang way the descrip-

tion

of the one we understand was requested in the

CY OSwALD's application to Albert Schweiteer College,

Churwaiden, Switzerland, was dated i9 March 1959, and he was

presumably to réport there on 20 april 1960. Destined for

discharge from the Marineson i December 1959, OSWALD accolerated

his exit on alleged grounds of family hardship in early

September 1959. On 27 September 1959 hr was issued a u.s:

Afternoon 01. 22 november 1963

At 1730 Mexico City time, about five hours after the

KENEDY agassination, provisos a Cuban Embassy employee named

"Luisa" received a telephone call in Spanish from an unidentified

male outside.

"If the caller asked her if she had heard the latest news.

Luisa jokingly replied; "Yes, of course, I knew it almost before

Kennedy. Imagine, one, two, three and now, that makes

(she laughs), what barbarians.

a Both speakers agreed on the seriousness of the assasaination.

"Luisa" also stated that the party at Silvia DURAN's had been called

off so it would not appear that they were celebrating the death

of KENNEDY, nor would they have the party coincide with the burial.

Finally she said she planned to move that night, into the house of

a doctor (a woman) friend.

Cuban Embassy denied him a visa. He requested

aid from CONTRERAS' group. CONTRERAS and others

mistrusted OSWALD because they felt he was a CIA

and part of the next day. OSWALD was very

introverted and appeared to be slightly crazy.

OSWALD made no mention of an assassination plot
