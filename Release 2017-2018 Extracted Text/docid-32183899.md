ReBulet 3/25/64.

Referenced letter set forth that[mex-18 and

MEX-19 should attempt

to resolve some of the questions

set forth in referenced letter and which have arisen with

regard to Mexico City letter and letterhead memorandum

dated 3/16/64.

(u)

It is noted that (MEX-18 and MEX-19

have

continually

been trying to resolve the questions which have evolved and

these informants have been anticipating and hoping that they

will be able to learn more from ELIZABETH CATLETT MORA

(Bufile 100-395934; MC file 100-939) as soon as they are

able to do so.

With regard to the questions set forth in referenced

letter, the following has been determined:

No confirmation has been received from any other

sources in Mexico that

the Communist Party of Mexico was

interested in obtaining all information regarding subject's

Mexico trip.

There has been no indication to date from

other persons that the Communist Party of Mexico has taken

any steps. to obtain this information or that the Communist

Party of Mexico was interested in obtaining information as

to how much

American authorities know about subject's trip

to Mexico.

In connection

with the question as to whether MORA

was referring to OSWALD's activities before he went to Russia

or before he went to Mexico,

Mex-18 and MEA-19/ were

that MORA stated OSWALD's activities before he went to Russia

and

not his activities before he went to Mexico.

cerning the statement which MORA made to Luex-18 (u]

and MEX-19

lat OSWALD was well known in Russia among the

Americans who were there at the same time as he was and that

"not that much of a nut," meaning that he could not

have undertaken singly to assassinate President Kennedy,

(W CHEX-18 and MEX-19 onsider that it was MORA's thought that

subject could not have undertaken the assassination.of

President Kennedy alone. B

As was noted in paragraph 3, page 2, of Mexico City

letterhead memorandum dated 3/16/64, MORA did not divulge her

source of her information regarding

the impression of OSWALD

gained fe Americans in the Soviet Union.

Since (eX-18 and LU

MEX-19Jve heard MORA make the statement previously that

she

has corresponded with MARY LOUISE PATTERSON, who

has been

residing in the Soviet Union, it is these informants' belief

that PATTERSON is the source in Russia who advised that OSWALD

was well known among American there

MEX-18 and MEX-19 have advised that they nope to

determine from MORA further details regarding her previous

statements about OSWALD:

From information which MEX-18 and MEX-19 have

learned about MORA becoming a Mexican citizen, it is considered

that if MORA were interviewed, she would be antagonistic

because she is strongly aware

her rights, as a lexican

citizen and (Mix-18 and MEX-19

save advised previously that LU

if any Mexican police attempt to at any time interview her,

they are going to run into

"a tiger.". If she were to be

interviewed by the Mexican police or by any representative

of the United States Government, there are no grounds to

believe that she would be cooperative in any manner and the

would ver coopere

probability exists that she would be astut

enough to determine

that she has told only MEX-18 and MEX-19A

information and U

this would expose these informants.

It is noted that (IEX-18 and MEX-19

have advised

that they are unable to ascertain information from MORA

through direct questions. Whenever a question is made to

MORA, she ceases talking, and the only manner in which these

informants are able to ascertain data from MORA is to needle

her, then sit back

and with a sympathetic ear listen to what

she

has to say

MEX-18 and MEX-19 Intend to learn from MORA addi-

tional details in order to answer the pertinent questions

which have arisen, and they intend to pursue vigorously the

objective set forth for them concerning any information MORA

has in her possession concerning OSWALD. To date these

informants have not been able to meet with MORA for a two

or three day period because of her illness

preoccupations.

and her other

Present plans are for them to take MORA

on a two or three day "vacation" in the first half of April.

As soon as these informants have net with MORA, this will

be reported immediately, and recommendations will be

mase

as to any additional investigative steps to be taken:

The reason for Mexico City letterhead memorandum

dated 3/16/64, being classified "SECRET" is being detailed

fully as follows:

the letterhead memorandum was classified "SECRET"

to protect

MEX-18 and MEX-19 Awho are informants in Mexico C4

furnishing highly sensitive Information involving espionage

and information vital to the internal security of the United

States. It is essential that the identities of these informants

be fully protected, especially since they are the only source

which received the information

and MORA is not known to have

discussed the information in the letterhead memorandum with

anyone else.

Under the circumstances,

the protection of these

informants is of paramount interest to the continued operations

of the Bureau in Mexico, and for thi

reason the letterhead

memorandum

was classified "SECRET

This office will continue to direct (EX-18

and

MEX-19

to

vigorously pursue their proposed contact with

MORA

and the results will be promptly reported to the Bureau
