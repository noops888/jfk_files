copies of Exhibit D-251 were forwarded to Dallas, with instructions

to be handled as exhibits had been handled previously. In view

of the fact that only three coples were furnished Dallas rather

than the usual four, Dallas is retaining one copy in its f1leg

and the two enclosed herewith are being considered as copies for

the President's Commission or its designated representative.
