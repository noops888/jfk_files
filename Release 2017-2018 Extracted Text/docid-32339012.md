Dear Jay:

Your letter makes me feel that I did not

read your manuscript with as

much insight or sensitivity

should have brought to it. The fault may be in

part in the manuscript itself,

but I feel that I

cannot be altogether absolved from blame for not under-

standing the intent, the inner drive of the thing,

even if this purpose is not fully realized. I feel it

is not realized, yet I believe it is there, wrapped

though it may be in detail.

The concept of broadening the study of film,

it (as yous say) as a

lens for the study of a

country's history and character, is necessary and I

am sure you are well equipped for the task.

The horrib-

ly. low level of film history or criticism in the U. S.,

resting as it does on a phoney aesthetic, has been

evident to me (perhaps with some subjective over-

emphasis) in the treatment of my FILM: THE CREATIVE

PROCESS-- not merely that so many critics

it, but that they attacked it without the faintest

suspicion of what it is about.

I feel that your letter states some of the

problems, but also states certain limitations (as I

in your approach.

Let me make three points:

first, you speak of'aesthetics" and "sociology:"

"sociology is probably dominant". I feel

is a danger in this,

because

it suggests a sep-

aration of the two approaches, and I feel that we

must achieve an integral approach.

Marxist thought has

in the cultural field from the separa-

tion, and a rather stuffy certainty that sociology

primary: art in the real sense,

the creative realization

is primary, and I think this

of human potentialities, its misuse and degradation in

view of art (along with

societies which are not creative) is the basis for a

richer approach.

Second point: the theme of "treatment of

women," which you mention could, I think, be infinitely

revealing, and more realized in terms of film--

and through the lens of film, the whole social situation.

Third point: Chronology!You are right that

have more freedom-- forward and backward, but

somahow the frame of reference,

the reality of time,

must determine the movement back and forward. The

question of time is, I think, a central factor in

cinema art-- and it must be so

in your nook.

All these problems face me in somewhat
