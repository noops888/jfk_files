Indicated) in paragraph 4.

2. AMMUG/L Lefouban Intelligence Service defector,

bas produced information of interest to the President's

Commission on the assassination of President Keanedy. CI

Staff learned of AMMUG/< oa 30 April. A questionnaire was

submitted by the Staff on 1 May (Attachment A). MI. Swenson,

who is handling the AMMUG/1 debriefing, provided a reply on

5 May (Attachment B). It was clear from Mr. Swenson's

summary that AMMUG/1 had information bearing on the

OSWALD relationship with the Cuban Embassy and Cuban

intelligence personnel in Mexico City, albiet his knowledge

was not that of a direct participant in matters affecting

OSWALD. A follow up questionnaire was submitted to

AMMUG/1 on 6 May (Attachment C). MI. Swenson's reply

was dated 8 May (Attachment D). Attention is directed

particularly to the content of paragraph two of Attachment D.

3. We have the problem of reconciling the operational

exploitation of AMMUC/1 and satiafying the responsibilities

we have undertaken with Mr. Rankin.: AMMUG/1 is such as

operational gold mine that Mr. Swenson wants, at a maximum,

two months to work fully. It is palpable, however, that we

must furnish to the Commission the substance of AMMUG/1's

On the, previous record of

our association with the Commission, particularly with Mr. Rankin,

it seems possible for the sigency to workout an arrangement with

MI. Rankin personally that would take care of their needs and ours

after a frank discussion

of the equities.

4. It is recommended ?

at the DDP in person or via a

designee, preferably the former, discuss the AMMUG/1

situation on a very restricted basis with Mr. Rankin at his

earliest convenience either at the Agency or at the Commission

headguarters. Until this takes place, it is not desirable to put

a Luisa CALDERON, since she returned to Cuba,

has been paid a regular salary by the DGI even though she has

not performed any services. Her home is in the Vedado section

where the rents are high.

Before going to Mexico, she worked in the Ministry of Exterior

Commerce in the department which was knows as the #Empresa

Transimport". Her title was Secretary General of the Communist

Youth in the department named in the previous sentence.

Luisa CALDERON wa

C. Conversations between CI Staff and

C/WH/SA/CI

1. When the Oswald Case first was discussed with the Source the

specific questions prepared by CI Staff were posed. The answers

given by the Source were reported in Reference A. That memorandum

which I dictated to a CI Staff stenographer appears accurate except for

sentence #9 which should have sald that the only possible "Yabrication'

known by Source was the specific denial by Fidel CASTRO, on a

television program, of any Cuban knowledge of Oswald.

2. On 07 and 08 May 1984 I further discussed the Oswald Case

with the Source in order to clarity exactly what he knew and what

he had heard. In the light of the explanation given by him, I believe

that a clearer understanding of what he knows can be reached if I

record his knowledge without using the question and answer format.

Accordingly, in the following paragraphs I shall report all the

Information given by the Source paraphrasing his explanations and

comments.

" I have no personal knowledge

Manuel VEGA Perez.

Manuel VEGA Perez previously had

been assigned to Mexico in the Cuban Consulate where he

was the principal intelligence attices of the DGI. VEGA

mentioned that OSWATiD had gone to the Cuban Consulate

two or three times in connection with a visa application

during the time that VEGA, as in Mexico. I gathered

although I do not know that VEGA made any specific

statement to this effect, that VEGA personally had seen

OSWALD. I well could have reached this conclusion

because normally VEGA and his assistant in Mexico for

the DGI, Rogello RODRIGUEZ Lopez, would see persons

applying for a visa to go to Cuba. This is because DGI

officers are charged with expediting the granting of visas

of agents of the DGi.

Such agents on appearing at the

Consulate use a special phrase to indicate their relationship

with the Dol.

(I do not know the particular phrase used

in every case. I do know that agenta from El Salvador in

requesting visas alwayer made mention of the name "Vauricia" )

The DCI officers ata Consulate Interview visa applicants to

find out if they areagents, Il the visa applicant does not use

a phrases the Dai oticers instead a

granting the vish immediately, tell the applicant to return li

a few days.

The ofticer then notifies Habana and requests.

authority for the visa.

I cannot recall if VEGA even made the

statement that he had requested permission to issue a visa to

OSWALD, but I feel sure that he would have done so because

VEGA had said that OSWALD had returned several times and

this would be the usual procedure.

I believe that Rogelio RODRIGUSZ Lopez also would have

seEn OSWALD because he worket

with VEGA and also would

have screened visa applicants.

I thought that Luisa CALDERON might have had contact with

OSWALD because I leafned about I7 March 1964, shortly before

I made a trip to Mexico, that she had been involved with an

American in Mexica. OTis intarmation to which l refer was told

because he gave me $40. 40 to buy some shoes and

other Items during my trip to Mexico.) I had

commented to HERNANDEZ that it seemed strange

that Luisa CALDERON was recelving a salary from

the DGl although ste apparently did not do any work

for the Service, CEERNANDEZ told me that hers was

a peculiar case and that ke himself believed that she

bad been restaited in Mexico by the Central Intelligence

Agency although Manuel PINEIRO, the Head of the DGI,

did not agree. As Krecall, HERNANDEZ had investigated

Luisa CALDERON. This was because, during the time

she was in Mexico, the DGI had intercepted a letter to

her by an American who signed his name as OWER (phonetic)

or something similar. As you know, the pronunciation

of Anglo-Saxon names is diflicult in Spanish so I am not

sure of how the name mentioned by HERNANDEZ should be

spelled. It could have been "Howard"' or something different.

As I understood the matter, the letter from the American

was a love letter but indicated that there was a clandestine-

professional relationship between the writer and Luisa

CALDERON: asg understood irom inHNANDEZ toat

after the interception anthe letter she had been followed

and seen in the companyal an American. I do not know it

this could have been OSWALD. I, myself, considered the

case of Luisa CALDERON unusual because I had known her

before she went to Mexico when she worked in the Ministry

of Exterior Commerce in the Empresa Transimport Department

where she was Secretary General of Communist Youth.

She

was transferred directly from that position to a post in Mexico

which seemed strange.

The only other person about whom you asked me in connection

with this, whom I recall, Is Sylvia DURAN and I know very

little about her. What happened r

kas that I was in the Cuban

Embassy in Mexico on 29 Masch 1964 about 1230 in the afternoon

preparing to return to Hahana the fameday. I was taling to

some other Cubans including Rogello RODRIGUEZ Lopez and

fnu BUENAVENTURA of the Cuban Embassy; a courier named

"Enio", a courier named. "Tato" and one other Cuban whom I

cannot recall.

I recall that, after the news of the assassination of

President Kennedy reached the Del, orders were issued

for all offigs of the DOl, at Headquarfers and in the tield,

to sort and package airdocuments according to whether

they were "muy gasreto" (very secret), "secreto" (secret),

or "Importante" (importanty

The material, once packaged

was to be held pending turther instructions.

All travel by

DGI officers and all DCI pouches were suspended temporarily.

In addition, I recall that DCI Headquarters personnel were

Instructed either to remain in the DCJ Headquarters offices

or to keep the DI aware of their whereabouts so that they

could be reached immediately. I do not know the reason for

these measures but I believe it logical that they were issued

because of the possibility that the United State might take

some type of action against Cuba and the DGI offices. As

nearly as I can recall, we were able to unpackage DGI files

and use them normally about the 3rd of December 1983."

3. In brief, the Source does not claim to have any significant

information concerning the assassination of President Kennedy of

about the activities of OSWALD LE the paraphrased comments of

the Source are considered to nee further chrification, I suggest that

Mr. Rocca, who is most familiar with the details af the OSWALD

Case, talk to the Source.& This can bevarranged at any time. Mean-

while, I shall have a question asked in a forthcoming LCFLUTTER to

determine whether or not the som-ce seems to have concealed any

information on this matter.

Specific: OSWALD

Case

The source does not have deg knowledge of Lee Harvey OSWALD

or his activities but was ableto provide items of interest based on

Cuban intelligence officers assigned to the Direccion General De

Inteligencia. The information appearing below was furnished by

the source and is keyed to questions submitted.

1. Prior to October 1963, OSWALD) Visited the Cuban Embassy

in Mexico City on two or three occasions. Before, during and after

these visits, OSWALD was in contact ith the Direccion General De

Inteligencia (DGI), specififally with Luisa CALDERON, Manuel

VEGA Perez and Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Dopez.

VEGA whole albas intelligence pseudonym is MARCOS

is the current CubanIS chef in Mexico. He recently has had a

tour of duty in Habana, prior to which he held the same post as.

now as Cuban IS chief in Mexico.

RODRIGUEZ is a Cuban IS staff officer in Mexico. He has

three Cuban intelligence pseudonyms, Eduardo, Casimiro and Jose

The precise relationship of Luisa CALDERON to the DGI is

not clear. She spent about six months in Mexico from which she

returned to Cuba early in 1964.

2.

The source does not know whether or not the Cuban Services

used OSWALD in any agent capacity of other manner.

3.

A.

When news of the assassination of President Kennedy

reached the DGI, it caused much comment concerning the fact

OSWALD had been in the Cuban Embassy in Mexico. In addition,

orders were issued for all headquarters and field officers of the

were "Muy secreto" (very secret),

"sécreto" (secret), and

"importante" (important). The material once packaged was to be

held pending further instruction's:

In addition, all travel by DGI

oificers and all DãI pouches

were suspended temporarily.

B. When the news that

•

ALD was the assassin reached

the DGI, there was no immediate comment but, when Fidel CASTRO

spoke on television to deny Cuban involvement, there was considerable

comment concerning OSWALD's visit to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico.

At this time VEGA, who has been mentioned previously, was in Cuba

and commented to a group of DGI staff officers that OSWALD had come

to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico to request a visa but had been refused.

VEGA did not give any details and the subject was not pursued.

4. It is not known whether information on OSWALD's visit to

the Cuban Consulate in Mexico in September 1963 was relayed to any

Cuban service.

5. It is not known if the Cuban intelligence services had contact

with the New Orleans' Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

6. The only Molina who-is recalled ig "The Hook", the Cuban who

was convicted in New York City for the murder of a young girl during

a clash between two Cuban groups. The DGI staff officer who had been

in the United Nations in New York, SANTIESTABAN traveled to Cuba

with "The Hook" and with another Cuban named ORIHUELA and upon

arrival in Cuba tried to obtain employment for both individuals. The

names Pedro Charles and Peter have no known significance.

7. The reaction of Soviet officials in contact with the Cuban intelli-

gence services is not known.

8.

Nothing is known about Soviet proposals following the news of

President Kennedy's assassination.

9. The only fabrication known is the special matter by Fidel

10. Nothing is known about Jack RUBENSTEIN aka Jack RUBY.

11. The name Gilberto LOPEZ is not familiar but, if he visited

DGI headquarters, a photograph of him possibly could be identified.

1.

Did anyone with the CIA tell any menber of the Warren

Commission or any lawyer serving on the Warren Commission

staff that such plans had been underway? If the answer is

yes, we would like to know what person or persons with the

Agency delivered said information,

to whom it was delivered,

it was delivered, what specifically was told or' said,

what documents there are to support the answers to the fore-

Joing guestions, and what response, 'if any-was received fron

Pesition. in

Disaline

The DDP called me this afternoon, 12 May, to state

that the

Directos has received a telephone call from RANKIN

regarding the Commission's desire to interview him at 1030 AM,

Thursday.

MI. HOOVER is scheduled to appear at 9:00 on that

morning.

2.

The DDP wishes to have from you a short but

comprehensive memorandum which highlights the basic issues or

positions entered into by the Agency in its dealings with the

Commission.

For example, RANKIN indicated that the Commission

would wish to hear the Dire ctor's views as to how improvements

might be made in protecting the President's life..

Further, they

will probably ask questions regarding the possibilities that a con-

spiracy existed.

Such general questioning certainly necessitates

that the DCI be made aware of the positions taken during previous

interviews.

I raised with Mr. HELMS the nature of the recent

information which you are processing which originated with the

•sensitive WH source.

I informed him that in your view this would

raise a number of new factors with the Commission, that it should

not go to the Commission prior to the Director's appearance unless

we have first had some preliminary reaction or made sure that the

Director is fully aware of its implications since it could well serve

as the basis for detailed questioning.

The DDP stated that he would

review this carefully and made a decision as to the question of timing.

3.

Given the schedule, you will appreciate that the DDP

will need a paper covering the above points as soon as possible.

There have been humore and)allegations which began

immediately after the assassitation which branded Oswald as a

U.S. Government agent, In many instances, CIA has been

named as his sponsor. The autharship, geographical dispersion

throughout the world, the identily of themes and the timing lend

As DCI, MI. McCope welcomes this appearance before

the Commission to make a categorical and unqualified denial of

these unprincipled distortions of the historical and personal

responsibilities for what was a dastardly and heinous act. In

witness of this, the DCI submits to the Commission an affidavit

which formalizes this statement. The affidavit is attached.

It is recommended that the DCI state concurrently with this

action that he desires to draw the Commission's attention to the

fact that the irresponsible charges that have been made, sponsored

up momentum over the past six years. We have traced the

sponsorship of that campaign directly to individuals and com-

ponents within the Soviet police state apparatus. Their un-

scrupulous treatment of the Oswald case was neither new as a

method nor a surprise as an occurrence.:

Il the DCI is challenged by anyone on the Commission

MI. Rankin raised than question dire ctly by letter. In

its response, the Agency confined itself to elements relating

to its statutory mission.

Specifically, it was suggested that:

a. The Secret Service, or Treasury, record

with tae Office os Contral Reference a formal require-

ment for information relating to Presidential security.

b. It was suggested that, if the Secret Service

intended to expand its l

gtettigence coverage of possible

threats to the President's security, our experience

showed that it would need a specialized organizational

component to handle that task within the Secret Service

itself.

c. The CLA reply also noted that the Agency was

in direct touch with the Secret Service regarding the

possible utilization by that agency of our experience in

machine data processing.

On the public record, it is

suggested that the DCI not repeat this detail.

In his presentation to the Commission after referring

to these earlier suggestions:

the DCI should state that he desires

to take the opportun

ggestion which he has not

tabled heretofore.

The Commission's major problem has been the assessment

of personal motive and the relationship of an individual act to

possible conspiratorial guidance. Because conspiracy is the

core of the problem, the DCI should point out the possibility of

legislative action which might be an assistance in preventing

recurrence of the national calamity it is investigating. There

is an analogy at close hand between the problem of developing in

advance information relating to Presidential security and the

problem faced by the country à few years ago regarding the

clandestine introduction or manufacture in the U.S. of special

nuclear material or atomic weapons. The remedy devised at that

time was embodied in the Atomic Weapons Reward Act of 15 July 1955

(29 Stat 365, PL. 165, 84th Congress). In essence, the Act estab-

lished a substantial reward ($500, 000) for information bearing on

the Act provided by any persos, and in certain instances privileged

treatment for such persons -- for example, asylum if they were

recommendation for original legislative action designed to

induce individuals to furnish information

bearing on Presidential

security by offering a substantial reward and preferential treatment.

The DCI should assure the Commission that he is convinced that

the substantial award, the special treatment, and the publicity

which would attend the implementing legislation in this matter

could represent a significant inducement even to staff officers

and personnel of secret associations and state security organs

abroad whose functions include assassination and sabotage.

It

is these individuals who would be privy to plans of executive action.

The reward would.constitute additional inducement for such

individuals to take the risk of making important disclosures.

The suggestion does not restion the material elements of

reward and special treatment. The DCI can assure the Com-

mission that we are aware that personnel in police state apparatuses

charged with the assassination and sabotage functions have repeatedly

expressed and, in many cases, acted upon their repugnance for

in advising the Commission to suggest that the Commission

indicate that the Commission might desire to suggest that any

legislation along these lines should be enlarged to include con-

spiracy to kill any Federal official in the President's personal

security affairs. (The Agency's Legal Counsel states that

(Regarding Public Statement

by CASTRO,

oy, attached

BACKGROUND

I. On Saturday evening, 7 September 1963,

Fidel CASTRO appeared at a Brazilian Embassy reception in

Havana; even more unusual, CASTRO submitted to an informal

interview by the Associated Press correspondent,

Daniel HARKER.

2. HARKER's interview reached New York on Sunday,

8 september; and was in print throughout the country on

Monday, 9 September.

There can be no question fron the

facts surrounding the CASTRO appearance, which had not been

expected, and his agreement to

the interview, that this

event represented a more-than-ordinary attempt to get a

message on the record in the United States.

3. CASTRO's statements to HARKER

covered a range of

topics but dealt principally with

erican political

leadership, in partacular Prêsi

dent KENNEDY, whom he ex-

coriated in extraoratnan

tive fasbion

(" ... KENNEDY is a cretin

the BATISTA of his

times ... the most opportunistic American President of

all time ...").

4.. The interview also contained an uncomplimentary

reference to Senator GOLDWATER and Cuban delay in signing

the limited nuclear test ban. There were differences in

the replay by United States newspapers like the

New York Times and Washington papers, with a result that

CASTRO's "message" was significantly modulated. '

5. In New Orleans, where Lee Harvey OSWALD resided

until the middle of Séptember 1963, the HARKER story

appeared in the principal morning papere the Times-Picayune,

on Monday, 9 September, page 7, under a three-column head-

line: "CASTRO Blasts Raids on Cuba.

Says U.S. Leaders

Imperiled by Aid to Rebels."

the story followed under the

HARKER by-line:

*Havana (AP) - Prime Minister

Fidel Castro said Saturday night: 'U.S-

leaders would be in danger if they helped

in any attempt to do away with leaders of

Cuba. '

to the warning and threat which gave the interview its real

any reference to the main thrust of CASTRO's remarks:

The Evening Star of Washington, D. C., printed_the HARKER

story nearly in its entirety in the second section of the

paper (9 september T96l, page B-4) and reworded the content

of the HARKER, interalew, placing the emphasis on the po-

Litical aspedo!

- in particular, highlighting the GOLDWATER

elements and burying CASTRO's warning to the United States

leadership in the middle of the piece.

7. There is no evidence in the files on the KENNEDY

assassination) that this CASTRO interview was considered in

following up leads or in dealings with the Warren Conmission

and its staff although Mexico Station specifically directed

Headquarters attention te the AP stary very shortly after

the Dallas killing. More important, the interview appears

to have been forgotten in the contemporary political consid-

eration of relations with CASTRO's Cuba. There is no evidence

in the Agency records, either, that the Warren Commission

staff itself pursued the implication of the CASTRO interview

in dealing with the conspiracy hypothesis. There is no

evidence in the files that anything along these lines was

stated by any other Cuban leader before the assassination.

8. The purpose of this review, undertaken at MI. Belin's

request, is to reconsider Lee Harvey OSWALD's activity on the

assumption that as an avid newspaper reader - which we know

from testimony of Marina OSWALD and others - he read the

CASTRO warning and threat as reported above. The results

aggressive makeup after his attempt to kill

Ciban diplomatic officials in

to be 'one of his lies, but later

believed. 'n2

10. Actually DELGADO's testimony says a lot more of

possible operational significance than is reflected by the

language of the report, and its implications do not appear

to have been run down or developed by investigation. Thus,

the record of the beginning of_OSWAlD's relationship with

the Cubans starts with a question mark.

11. The period was one of transition in U.S. - Cuban

relations after CASTRO's takeover. OSWALD, and DELGADO at

the outset, were CASTRO supporters, OSWALD being particu-

larly keen about how to get to the island. DELGADO testi-

INTERCEPTED CONVERSATIQNOF CUBAN EMBASSY EMPLOYEE;

LUISA CALDERON, APTERNOON OF 22 NOVEMBER 1963

K3Q Mexico City time, about five hours after the

KENNEDY assassination, a Cuban Embassy employee named

"Luisa" received a telephone call in Spanish from an uniden-

tified male outside.

19. The caller asked her if she had heard the latest

news. "Luisa" jokingly replied:: "Yes, of sourse. knew

it almost before KENNEDY ... Imagine, one, two, three and

now; that makes three [she laughs], what barbarians!

20. Both speakers agreed on the seriousness of the

assassination. "Luisa" also stated that the party at

Silvia DURAN's had-been called off so it would not appear

that they were celebrating the death of KENNEdy, nor would

they have the party coincide with the burial. Finally she

said sherplanned tg wove that night into the house of a

Directorate, conéral of Intelligence (DGI).

She returned to Cuba in 1964 and was reported

to be working in DGI Headguarters.

b. The DGI element in Mexico City in the

fall of 1963 was headed by Alfredo MIRABEL Diaz

who had arrived on 2 September 1963, formally

•as the replacement of the Consul Eusebio AZCUE

chief (and as of June 1964, MIRABEL's successor)

was Manuel Engenio VEGA Perez.

conversation was the receptionist, a Mexican

national, who dealt with OSWALD during his known

visits on 27 and 28 September to the Cuban

installations in connection

with a Cuban visa

application for stay and/or transit.

Silvia DURAN is the sole live witness on the

d. Manuel Engenio VEGA Perez,

Rogelis RODRIGUEZ Lopez, were positively

He left Mexico City on 3 November 1963

VEGA that all individuals going to Cuba, legally

took the biographical data and sent it to Cuba

a lame duck like AZUE whose slot had been taken by the

DGI chief? Whatever the answer to these questions, they

were not asked at the time.

And there remains the more

fundamental question: accepting the DURAN story on its

face, could it have happened without the knowledge and

participation of the DGI personnel above cited?. This

seems unlikely especially because VEGA is later pited by

a Cuban DGI defector as having stated he was aware OSWALD

made several visits to the Cuban Consulate. It is clear

the implications of the two intercepted telephone conversations

ultimately broken by the

use of the polygraph on which ALVARADO showed evidences of

28.

The ALVARADa Story is a particularly acute repre-

senta

the difficulties

that beset the evaluation of

observed

eldence: certain elements of the story persist

despite the impeachment of its major premises. ALVARADO,

whose account did not become public until the release of

the Warren Report in October 1964, talked consistently of

the presence in the Cuban Consulate transaction of a Negro

with red-dyed hair.

ficulate and

socially prominent Mexican writer, married, but separated

from a high-ranking Mexican foreign service official.

She

is also the cousin of Horacio DURAN. the husband of

Silvia DURAN, cited above. There is a strong personal

antipathy between the two women descending from

Elena GARRO's trenchant anti-Communis,,

30. From October 1964 _until his retirement in the fall

of 1969, a U.S. Embassy OffiCel, Charles THOMAS, persistently

kept up a stream of reports and memoranda reflecting GARRO's

account of what had actually gone on between OSWALD, the

Cubans and in

Embassy daring the period she now finds out

that doveta dad here in Moxico prior to the.

assassination. She was invited by a Mexican

secretary in the Cuban Embassy whose husband

standing around together like three bumps on a

she asked someone in the Cuban Embassy about

them and was told that 'they were just passing

three Gringos stood out she took a good look

at them as did her daughter. When the

assassination occurred and OSWALD's picture was

spread into the newspapers, both Elena and

her daughter immediately said that he was one

of the three Gringos

Rantin stated that the Coumission wants to account

in dotall, minute by minute and hour by hour,

Ar. Bagley agreed, pointing out that DERYABIN's comment and

a menorandun inforning the Commission that we rould need

I Instructed ir.

Nigren to prepare the

6. Mr. Angleton reported that he had asked the Commis

sion representatives certain questions pertairing to our use

of defectors in analysing the Oswald papers:

ve

Has the Commission formally requesting us to

defectors analyse the material?

r. Yellins thought that the answer

piU to this question

Is yes.

However,

M5. Angleton asked for a formal

requast fron the Comission to this

effect.

The FBI. has stated that 118

reports are not to be passed to

ALLADLE, which nay cause some compli

cations.

b.

Would the comission be prepared to assume the

radically dilferent hypothesis or late cotation?

The persons present said that the

Commission would.

sis of the docunents should be unwilling to appear peison-

ally and formally before the Commission, would the

Connission exercise its subpoena powers against hin?

Ar. Rankin thought that if there was

involved for the defector, the

Commission would not do so.

Rankin pronised to get a fornal answer

Iron the Commission on this point.

d.

Fill the classification we put on our corres-

pondence to the Commission be hozored?

The answer was that ln principle our

classiftcation: would be honored.

One matter which had been brought to light by the

Oswald casa was the need for a mechanion in the United States

handling of Anerican defectors to the USS?.

The Bureau is
