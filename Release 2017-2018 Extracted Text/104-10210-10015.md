1962 and January-February 1964•

c. U.S, Personnel and Installations in Genevar

NOSENKO was Interrogated on his earlier story that

he had seen in Geneva in 1964 the file on KGB actlilty

against American installations in Geneva (KGB cryptonym

"SKONPICH") •

His version this time conflicted with

his 1964 version but contained the same message, that

the weal and understaffed KGB in Geneva had little

polygraph reactions did not suggest that he was as

sensitive to KISLOV as to other individuals and matters

covered in the same series of questions.
