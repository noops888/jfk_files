ReBuairtel, 2/26/59, page 2, concerning MIami PCI HERB RAU.

Since RAU was evidentally close to NORMAN ROTHMAN, FBI # 152585B,

during 1957, he should be interviewed immediately

background information concerning ROTHMAN's gun running activities

that might assist in bringing this case to a successful conclusion.

Moreover, RAU should be interviewed for intelligence information

he may have as to gun running activities on the part of Doctor

LOUIS C. PESSOLANO, JOE MEROLA and STUART SUTOR.

New York airtel

to the Bureau dated 1/28/59 entitled "Cuban

Retaliation Against Batista Adherents in the U.S. - IS - Cuba, "

page 3, indicates VICTOR H. RAMS PiENTE, former Captain of

Military Intelligence, Cuban Army, was granted permission to

travel to Miami, Florida, from New York, 1/24/59. New York Office

advised PUENTE reportedly expected to remain in Miami.

As a former

Intelligence Officer, PUENTE could logically be expected to have

information of value

to this case since weapons stolen from ONG

were probably intended for CASTRO forcés.
