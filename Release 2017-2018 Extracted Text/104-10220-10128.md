COMMENTS RE DEROGATORY TRACES

ATTACHMENT TO FORM 772

1.

A POA was requontod on Sublect in January 1968 for hl:

uBO As & penetration of L

Cancellation vas roguested in February 1968 because

o1 indications that Subjoct was involved in

"clandestine sabotage

activity and suspicions that Subject failed to report his activi

tios to CIA.

Thereafter, Subject was treatod as a "hostile".

In the ensuing months Subjoct was describod as

"an extromely

valuable penetration" bucause of his important and accurate

intelligence information and operational roports.

Subject was

givon a polygraph exanination to clear up questions about pos

sible affiliation with Cuban Intelligence, unreported associa-

tion with gangstor elenents, ote.

His responses showed no

information which would provent CIA using him for ops purposes.

Request for POA was again roquested on 7 Soptomber 1968.

This

РОЛ

request was turned down on 15 October duo to Subject being

an "agent of a foreign powor."

Sinco that tine Subject has continued to provide verbal

and written information roports concerning Communist and subver

elements, guerrilla activities,

Sovlot activities, sabotage,

continues to roport accuratoly and often

a vory pro-u.s. attitudo.

Subject was again polygraphod on

29 November 1971 (a copy of which is

contained in

Subject's

CI/OA folder).

His responsor indicated no deception concern-

Ing truthfulness of reporting to CIA,

no compromise of his

U.S. Government connections, non-involvement in illegal arms

dealings, etc.
