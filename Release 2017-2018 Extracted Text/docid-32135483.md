It is felt the unauthorized disclosure of information

attributed to these sources could possibly compromise them

vere conducted by SA RONALD E. YOUNG to the Citizens

Committee of Inquiry, 156 Fifth Avenue, NYC, under the

guise of a person interested in LANE's defense of LEE HARVEY

OSWALD.

Two copies of this communication are being furnished

to the Dallas Division in view of their interest in this

matter.
