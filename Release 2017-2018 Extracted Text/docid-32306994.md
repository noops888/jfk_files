Rerep of SA WILLIAM A. WIGHTMAN dated 7/11/60 at

Miami and Newark airtel to Bureau dated 6/6/60 captioned "LUIS

ARENAL; IS - CUBA; RA - CUBA".

On 6/6/60 CHARLES SEIDENARI (protect by request),

who has furnished reliable information in the past, and who is

Delegate Secretary of the New Jersey Branch of The

White Rose,

furnished the following information:

SEIDENARI reported that he has been in contact with

two individuals who wished to unite all anti-CASTRO forces into

one organization.

He stated that one of these was MIRANDA and

the other was LUIS ARENAL, who resides at 4415 43rd Ave.,

Sunnyside; Long Island, N.Y. ARENAL's home telephone is

EX 2-3199, and his office telephone number is DI 4-7188-89-90.

SEIDENARI said that ARENAL had contacted him recently in an

effort to unite the anti-CASTRO groups in this country. ARENAL

told SEIDENARI that he gave $25,000 to DIAZ LANZ, the former

Cuban military aviator who defected and now resides in or near

Miami, Fla.

SEIDENARI stated that ARENAL stated that this money

was paid to LANZ to perform some function against the CASTRO

that he did not know whether ARENAL is sincere or a

possible confidence man.

Newark indices fail to reflect

any identifiable information concerning ARENAL based on information

available.

On 7/20/60 SEIDENARI advised that he could furnish

no additional identifying information concerning ARENAL.

He

stated that he has only met ARENAL on a few occasions and

was at his home in Sunnyside, Long Island, N.Y., on two occasions.

SEIDENARI reported that ARENAL had stated

that he wished to

unite all anti-CASTRO groups for an eventual overthrow of the

CASTRO regime. During the course of his conversation, ARENAL

stated that he had given $25,000 to DIAZ LANZ but did not

elaborate with further details, and SEIDENARI did not question

him concerning this.

ARINAL only stated that this money was

to be paid to DIAZ LANZ to perform some function against the

CASTRO regime.

SEIDENARI stated that ARENAL has

a large radio

transmitter in his home but stated that because he was not

familiar with this type of equipment, he would not be able

to elaborate with further details concerning this equipment.

SEIDENARI stated that he did not expect to have any

additiopal contact with ARENAL in the future as he was inclined

to look upon ArENAl and several others who had contacted him for

a similar purpose with skepticism.

Also on 7/20/60 SEIDENARI stated that he has had one

defection from The White Rose to DIAZ. LANZ. He stated this

City. NoJ

persuaded

"to join the forces of DIAZ LANZ by promises of

prompt action by that group in regard to the CASTRO regime..

CONFIDICHIAL

Full details of subject's involvement in

a recent invasionary attempt headed by subject against

cuba, will be reported in the case entitled "PEDRO LUIS

OSCAR DIAZ LANZ, NM", Bufile 2-1597;

On May 11, 1960, BERNARD REICHARDI, local

CIA representative, Miami, contacted the Miami Office

and desired to know if the FBI was aware of any invasionary

plans imminent on behalf of subject.

At that time REICHARDT expressed the opinion

that should DIAZ LANZ attempt such an onslaught, it would

probably result in adverse criticism of the United

States, and that due to certain unsavory rumors concerning

DIAZ'

appropriation of funds from anti-CASTRO personalities

for his own use, DIAZ LANZ was not regarded by CIA as being

an acceptable figure in the anti-CASTRO movement.
