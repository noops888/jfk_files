For Your Information

CIUNSTORICAL FEVEN PROGEAM

1. The following information was obtained from AMMUG-1 when

questioned concerning his knowledge of songs used in radio communication::

In connection with reference:

ARES. KINALDY

a.

When ford

ain, died "AUGUSTO" personally came to the liational

Liberation Buildiny and held a meeting with the officers of that section. Ic

Instructed those individuals who maintained communications with organiza-

Lions of their respective countries, as well as with some agent, to prepare

in system of communication using some song, lecture, conmercial, etc.,

which could le transmitted by lidio Havana, Cuba, and could be used to send

easily understood ciphered messages.

U. ANMUG-1 believes that Norberto HERNANDEZ Curbelo chusc

the musical recording of "Las Seis Lindas Cubanas" (Six Beauliful Cubans),

He believes this sung was written in the 1920's by

Antonio Maria ROMEU, who leads his own orchestra; however, the sung

was made popular by the "ARAGON' orchestra during the "Cha ( la Cha em."

(Comment: FOMEU is approximately 80 years old and undoubtedly is identical

with the individual referred to as Antonio Maria ROMERO in reference.)

2. "AUCUSTO" or "Agusto" was previously Identified by AMNUG-I as

Deputy Chief of the DGI, and is probably identical with Carlos Sixto CHAIN

Soler, Deputy to Manuel PINEIRO, Chief of the DGI.

3. It is not known whether there is any connection between the son"

tilles nentioned in reference as "tres lindas Cubanas" and the AMMUG-I

ASSET

Information reported in paragraph 1, b above, Howeves, the similarity

of the titles is obvious, and the tentative identification of the composer

lends additional credence to the Station's suspicions regarding the unusual

nature of the intercepted conversation. Headquaters would appreclate

receiving any further information which to may be able to develop

on other conversations between "Allonso" and his Cuban counterpart,.

aS

well as any comments or information which Mexico City may be able to

provide on the personalities mentioned in reference.

Distribullon:

3 - COS, l

2 - COS, Mexi

ote: There is a strong possibility that the songs referted to in paragrap

b and 3 are the same since the Spanish words Tres (three) and seis (si

are often confused when heard by non-Spanish speakers.
