the activities of Chicago top racket figure Samuel Giancana

Technical difficulties have drastically

reduced the productivity of this source during the past few

the Armory Lounge is secure and the difficulty has been in

extending line outside the target area.

utilized by Chicago Office for misur matters.

Cost is

$50 per month for space and there will be an

added cost

There is a definite need for the

Chicago Office to gain full benefit from our installation

in the Armory Lounge.

Recommend request be approved.(U)
