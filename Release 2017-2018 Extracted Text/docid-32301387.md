"on. But anyway, so we fo in there this morning,

see,

and

I see JACK GELLMAN (PH) .

JACK GELLMAN has been previously identified as

the former Niagara County District Attroeny and currently

the President of Consolidated Bowling Corporation.

Both

ChantER and GELLMAN were the original promoters of the

Consolidated Bowling Corporation, which operates bowling

alleys, motels, and hotels both

in the United States and

abroad.

In describing the exclusive ownership of the

one of the Bay street boys.

SCRO remarked "coompa, you

know LOU CHESLER is in with LANSKY, MEYER LANSKY, and

VITO

ORDACRATELLI (PH) - they're the ones that do all the

operation of it, do you follow me?

They're the ones that

bought this thing, coompa,

"that's New York, you know "whereupon NATARELLI remarks

At this point, SCRO remarks that ANGELO (BRUNO)

was recently in the Buffalo area and had discussed this

matter with STEVE MAGADDINO.

The discussion apparently

related to the transfer of the license or Exemption

Certificate and that JACK GELLMAN had been consulted about

this matter.

According to SCRO, MAGADDINO told him that "if

they're the only

ones that

got the license then you and I

got to go to New York and we'll straighten it out.

If he's

got the license and can get anybody he wants then I'll

come back up here and we'll straighten out up this end;

but the main thing is to find out first who's got it and

who can run it.

On 5/29/63, Constable ROBERT STONE, National

Criminal Intelligence Unit, Royal Canadian Mounted Police,

Toronto, was requested to develop any information he could

obtain concerning the background of Mrs. GEORGIA, GROSS,

apparently the wife of WALLACE GROSS, and of her association

With LOUlS A. CHESLER of Toronto. It is noted that the

Royal Canadian Mounted Police in

Toronto 1s familiar with

the background of CHESLER, having received inquiries from

London, England, and Miami, Florida, concerning his

operations.

In connection with this request, Constable STONE

was advised of the fact that the Buffalo FBI Office had

received information from a highly confidential source to

the effect that Buffalo criminals, including STEVE MAGADDINO,

had evidenced interest in attempting to place syndicate

money in a hotel-gambling casino operation, the license for

which had been obtained or was being obtained by LOU CHESLER

and Mrs. GEORGIA GROSS.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police

was further informed at that time that this particular

license was one issued by the Governor General of the Grand

Bahamas,

entitling the holder to operate a gambling casino

and a hotel in the Grand Bahamas.

The Buffalo Office will continue to review the

information furnished by both BU 82-C* and BU 280-g* or

5/24/63, and subsequent dates concerning the developments

of this new gambling venture.

It is noted that the names

VITO CRITELLI

GEORGIA GROSS (A TERRY COLAVITO, POLIANO, and MrS.

are unknown to the Buffalo Office.

UTMOST CAUTION MUST BE TAKEN IN DISCUSSING OR IN

DISSEMINATING ANY INFORMATION SET FORTH ABOVE IN ORDER TO

FULLY PROTECT THE IDENTITY OF BU 82-C* IN BUFFALO, NEW YORK.
