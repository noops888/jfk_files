reaction of Fidel CASTRO and his principal associates to the

Soviet withdrawal of offensive missiles from Cuba and to U.S.

demands re the withdrawal of Soviet IL-28 aircraft and on-spot

"backed down" before the U.S. and was negotiating with

the U.S. on an independent basis. CASTRO must have considered

possessed a compulsion for revenge which was notorious; on occasion

his compulsion caused him to reach back as far as twenty years to

revenge actions taken against him at that time. Source added that

U.S. or some gross act against the Soviet Ambassador in Cuba.
