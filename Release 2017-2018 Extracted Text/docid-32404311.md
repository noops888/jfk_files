Barry,

Per our conversation of this morning, and per Tenet's recent instriction to

search once again for information relevant to JFK's assassination, I think we need

to call up the entire HYSAGE-1 (Panamanian leading leftist, Thelma KING) file.

rocoding to lake stin, i a hone conversion on the aftemon oF s

August, he (Jake) was debriefing her and the meeting was interrupted by Sammy

BOYD (Panamanian business leader) announcing JFK's assassination. KING

immediately broke down, began crying and said something to the effect of-they

said they would not do it. Jake tried to obtain more information but KING

regained her composure and added nothing more. Jake is convinced that as they

had been talking about Fidel, Che, Raul and PINIERO (head of Cuban

intelligence), KING was referring to them. Further, according to Jake, KING at

one time or another talked of meeting OSWALD, possibly in Cuba or elsewhere.

Jake had reported the above information, but it was very closely held at the time

so it may not have moved into the JFK material.
