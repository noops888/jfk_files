Re Havana letter to the Bureau dated 12/31/60.

As of the date of the last letter, SANTO TRAFFICANTE

Regular contact with PCIl

had heard that TRAFFICANTE had returned to Cuba for five or

six days and had again returned to Florida. He did not come

to the apartment building although he continues to pay the

rent and still has the apartment.

in the Capri casino, Havana, he noticed TRAFFICANTE with

NICHOLAS DI COSTANZO, HY BEDOL and an individual, apparently

American, unknown to

as he had been able to ascertain, TRAFFICANTE returned to Cuba:

about January 19, 1960, and is in an apartment in the FOCSA

Building, a 40-story apartment building, and is using an

apartment there in the name of HENRY SAAVEDRA. SAAVEDRA is.

also from Tampa and is associated with gamblers working at

the Hotel Capri casino.

HAV-33 also reported that he saw TRAFFICANTE on

February 9 and 11, 1960, at the Hotel. Comodoro casino. It i:

noted that both HAV-33 and PCI

Jhave reported in the

past that when TRAFFICANTE does not have his wife in Cuba, he

frequently takes show girls to his apartment or goes to the

apartment of some other individual.

It is requested that Miami advise if any information
