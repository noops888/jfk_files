Pakistan would meet with Andrei. Gromyko at the Soviet Mission t

the United Nations, 3 p.I.: September 22, 1965. This information

was immediately furnished to the Department of State; however,

our lack of technical coverage on the Pakistani Mission to the

United Nations again precluded our obtaining results of the

probable telephonic contaci, following this meeting, between the

Foreign Minister of Pakistan and the President of Pakistan. (S)

The curtailment of our technical and microphone

3. TECHNICAL SURVEILLANCES

5-Birsneie

Technical surveillances are being used only in security-type

cases. Any departure from this, such as in a kidnaping case, is presente:

to the Director for approval.

We are presently examining each of the technical surveillances

to insure that this technique is not beins used in a case with Drosecutive

possibilities.

The attached proposed instruction to the field stresses

the fact that the Bureau will not authorize any technical surveillance

in a case with prosecutive possibilities, ase do not want to run into

the question of tainted evidence.

We disseminate a great deal of information outside the Bureau

from our technical surveillances, for examptento the White House,

State Department, CIA, the military intelligence agencies, and the

Department. This is necessary because we secure a great deal of intelli

gence

data on such matters as the plans of various countries regardins

issues being considered at the United Nations; the purpose of a pendinz

contact between a foreign diplomat and the State Department, or the

White house; plans of the Communist Party to initiate programs, or to

RE:

TECHNIQUES

the Communist Party or subversive elements to infiltrate the racial

movement; possible racial disturbances; advance planning of Martin Luther

King and his associates; demonstrations against Congressional committees,

et cetera. We also pick up information regarding Security Index subjects

which is

included in investigative reports that eventually go to the

Department, as the Department passes on Security Index cases.

Our safeguards in the area of technical surveillances are

(a) careful evaluation before they are installed. Current instructions

are that they shall not be used in any case with

prosegutive possibilitie:

(b) Paraphrasing or covering up of the source when we disseminate, so

that the recipients cannot determine that the source of the information

is a technical surveillance.

(c) Should a case develon prosecutive possibilities, despite our eff rts

not to use technical surveillances in any case which may develop int

prosecution, we will insist on a complete understanding with the Depart-

ment and the US Attorney, so that we will not run into another case,

such as the JARO case, handled so ineptly by US Attorney Hoey.

4. MICROPHONE SURVEILLANCES

Microphone surveillances are being employed in security cases (44)

and criminal intelligence matters (60). Each installation of a micro-

phone must be approved by Mr. Tolson's office.

We are presently going over each of these existing surveillances,

in the security field, to insure that they are not being employed where

there are prosecutive possibilities, and the same precaution will be

lused in future installations. The attached radiogram to the field

so instructs the field.

Intelligence information coming from these security microphones

is likewise disseminated, when pertinent, to outside agencies, with

appropriate paraphrasing and coverup of the source so that the

recipients will not know the source.

and copert on into

As in the case of technical

surveillances, valuable intelligence data is derived from these sources.

In the criminal intelligence field microphone surveillances

have been a primary source of information permitting us to gain knowledge

of the activities in the field of organized crime, and particularly

Cosa Nostra. The information derived has enabled us to know of the

organization and planning of leaders of organized crime, and has pro-

vided data leading toward our primary goal of infiltrating, penetrating

and disrupting organized crime, and provided leads to develop Live

informants within organized crime. Following the leak from the Depart-

ment in the Las vegas case we stopped disseminating to the Department

and the US Attorneys any information coming from our microphone surveil-

lances, and since that policy was adopted we have had no further leaks

Irom these sources. The only dissemination we make is when we pick up

information about a possible forthcoming murder, or a matter within

the jurisdiction of local authorities.

"e then disseminate to carry

out our responsibilities, but we paraphrase and cover the source.

Fie

have had no difficulty in this regara.

The attached radiogram to the

field reiterates instructions that information coming from these

criminal intelligence microphones must not be disseminated without

prior Bureau authority.

If approved, we will operate along the lines set forth above.

MR. DE LOACH

I called the Attorney General and advised him I had

checked both matters he had inquired about earlier today and

we, of course, have never tapped (Joseph) Alsop's phone and

-have had no surveillance on young Reston.

-

I further advised him that Mr. Deloach told me that

Moyers told him Alsop came in to see Moyers yesterday. The

Attorney General said this was the reason for his phone call.

I advised him that Alsop said he was going to prite a column

If we didn't take it off right away. I said as far as I am

concened Alsop can write anything he pleases.

The Attorney

General said before we get to that, what he is trying to do now

is make euro nohody did.

T said it is entirely possible the

Defense Department or the Comptroller General's office did. i

further stated we could very readily check his (Alsop's) phone

and find out but I wouldn't do that for him.

As to young Reston, I said there was no investigation

by us but it is entirely possible another agency did.

The Attorney General said the thing that occurred to

him is that Alsop believes this because he said something over

the phone which he said to nobody else and,

therefore,

phone must have been tapped,

but it is possible Alsop

talked on

-a phone that was tapped and it was not his phone. I said that

is possible; that it is entirely possible these other Government

agencies are tapping phones.

The Attorney General said the President talked to

him about that and he told the President he was contemplating

that no taps be authorized by anyone except himself - but he

has not discussed this with all the other departnent heads - so

he would have a central control. I told him I recomnended that

back under Tom Clark.

He said the President though that was

good idea. He further, said, if that is set up the way he would

like done, the requests would come through me to him. I said I

would be glad to do that.

He said Mckamara is perfectly

agreeable to this and McNamara thinks it is not possible in

Defense without his or Vance's approval but that is not his

(the Attorney General's) impression. I said it is not mine.

He said he told the President he had absolutely no question

about the Bureau in this regard but could not speak for the

other agencies.

I stated that, if an agent should get out of line,

he would be fired right away; that they understand that very

clearly; that when we have requests from the field that we

turn down, we don't even send them around to hift; that we try

to keep them down to 50 or 60 for the entire country in

espionage and kidnaping cases.

He remasked that kidnapings

are very rare. I explained that, where the life of an individual

or the life of the Nation is threatened, I think it warranted.

I said that three years ago, we had

about 100 and now have

gotten it down to about aù or so and ile ileiù is very

sensitive to the fact that they will not be approved here unless

it is something very vital; and I think this would be the only

way to do it.

The Attorney General said also he would like to

setup some similar procedure on microtone installations;

that he really ought to be informed in this regard, not be

told after but be told prior. I stated I am perfectly willing

to have that done; that

I see no objection.

The Attorney

General said he does notthink it is right to put a respon-

no to take son,

sibility like that on the Bureau; if authing comes out, he

has to take responsibility and so he might just as well

the responsibility.

I related that there are four categories: the so-

called mail covers and they have been discontinued; the so- called

trash covers and we have one in Miami on a Cuban who is working

for the Castro element; the other two categories are in so-called

phone covers and in the microphone covers. I said we still have

some microphone covers though not in large numbers; that they

are largely limited to espionage and dosa Nostra activities;.

•but I would start right away on the microphones the way we

follow on

"the telephones.

The Attorney General indicated he wanted to discuss

this with me in detail but not on the phone that he thought

on the taps we might have a system where the authorization

would run for a specific time, six months or something; that

as it is now he has no idea when they are taken off or when

they continue to go on. I advised him that we re-evaluate

each phone tap every thirty days; that I have no objection

on re-evaluation to again notifying him we would like to

continue the tap. He said he was thinking of a longer period.

I said we could take three months or six months and he said

whatever fits in with our practice. I stated I would ge glad

to do whatever he suggests.

(President's

memorandum

Mr. Sullivan

of 6/30/65)

on the morning of 7/30/65 Assistant Director Der dach and

I met with Harold F. Reis of the Attorney General's Office and Howard

Willens of the Criminal Division, with reference to the President's

memorandum of 6/30/65 dealing with technical and microphone

surveillances.

DOr:

The President's memorandum restricts wire taps to

national security cases and requires the prior approval of the

Attorney Gonoral:

As the Bureau does clear everv technical survei-

lance in advance with the AG, no action is required by us.

The President's memorandum also states that each agency

should consult with the AG to see that the agency's practices in

microphone surveillances are in accordance with the law and with a

decent regard for

the rights of others.

Messrs. Reis and Willens

were advised that the FBI does clear its microphone surveillances

with the AG and, therefore, the AG is fully cognizant of our practices

and policies.

The President's memorandum calls for an inventory of

mechanical and electronic equipment to intercept telephone conversa-:

tions, and a list of interceptions currently authorized, and the

reasons for them.

Messrs. Reis and Willens advised that it would

not be necessary for the Bureau to submit sucó information to the

Department, inasmuch as all technical surveillances by the Bureau

have,

been under the strict control of the Department of Justice.

Mr. Reis said that it would be nevessary for the AG to

send a directive around to various agencies which use wire taps,

giving instructions as to the form which should be used in clearirg.

technical surveillances with the AG.

He asked whether the Bureau

could prepare such a directive, and whether the Bureau would be in a

position to advise the AG whether these requests from other agencies

had merit.

Mr. Tolson

¡comment on the merits of any of these requests. In so far as the foru

of the requests from other agencies is concerned, I pointed out that

when we request technical surveillances from the

AG we put in

sufficient information to show that the matter concerns internal

security and a paragraph as to the merits of the case, and that the

request from the agency should have sufficient information in it

to permit the AG to rule on its merits. I told Reis we would give

him samples of our requests so that he could use them in drawing up

instructions to the other agencies.

In discussing the question as to how the other agencies

would present their requests to the AG, Messrs. Reistand Willens

were advised that we would be glad to have such.

requests picked up

from the other agencies by our liaison representatives, and delivered

the AG's office, and thereafter return the requests, with the

AG's action, via liaison, to the appropriate agencies.

Mr. Reis

said that he was insisting that requests from the other agencies

ime thingh the top man;

would have to come from the ofiice of

the Secretary of Defense.

Relative to other agencies consulting with the AG as to

their practices in the use of microphones, Mr. Willens indicated

that he would probably be the one who would discuss this matter

with other agencies, for the AG.

ACTION:

None •

We will furnish to Mr. Reis a couple of samples

of our requests

for technical surveillances, after eliminating any

confidential names, et cetera, from them.

I accompanied the Director to the Attorney General's officẻ

at 5 p.m., on 5/6/65 to discuss the use of technical and nicrophone

surveillances by the Bureau in our work.

The AG advised that he was not concerned about the use of

these techniques in

security work, apparently on the basis that the

need for such techniques in this field was apparent to everyone. He

said he was in agreement with the Director's position that all

technical surveillances by all government departments and agencies

should come through the AG for approval, in order that a strong control

could be maintained. He indicated he had talked to Secretary McNamara

who said the military were nui using wise laus, auù iu Difectos locono

of CIA, who indicated CIA had only had one wire tap, which the FBI

knew about (this was in a leak case involving a newspaperman in

Northern Virginia, which we declined to handle). The AG thought it

would be desirable for other agencies and departments to arrange

with the FBI

to place wire taps for them, when necessary, thus

insuring central control and handling.

We advised the AG that this was not desirable; that we had

found, as a matter of practice, that the only way you could keep these •

matters secret was to keep them within the FBI, and that we would not

admit to anyone that we actually had wire taps on specific persons -

or organizations, even though we cleared technical surveillances in

advance with the

State Department when they related to foreign

lestablishments. It was pointed out that the only one in the Depart-

ment of Justice who knows of the wire taps and microphones we have

is the AG himself, as such information does not go out of the AG's

office, and while persons.

we disseminate, they could not make a

could guess, as a result of information that

positive statement.

We reiterated

that we would not want to handle wire taps for some other agency.

The AG expressed

concern

about microphone coverage of

hoodlums in criminal work.

He said he was not concerned about

recording devices carried on the persons of our informants, of in

automobiles, of the rooms of informants, nor was he concerned about

legal microphones. He was concerned about the possibility that the

Department and the Bureau would be embarrassed by attorneys, such as

Edvard Bennett Williams, raising the issue of; microphones in court,

such as in the Las Vegas case.

We pointed out thät the Las Vegas matter arose as a result

of a leak, and we are not disseminating information from our micro-

phones, as such, any more to safeguard against such a leak; further,

Williams' attempt to utilize the Las Vegas microphones in the Alderisio

case in Denver backfired on Williams, and Williams has instructed that

the suit against the telephone company in Las Vegas be dropped as oi

5/14/65.

It was pointed out that La Cosa Nostra is aspowerful group

which spearheads organized crime in this country.

It has immense

power through corruption, money, influence in political and law

enforcement circles, and wields

power over its membership and asso-

ciates through fear; that it constitutes a menace to the welfare of

the country because of its power and influence, and has been surrounded

by an aure of invincibility.

We hare waged an

allanut attark on

this

group, using any and

all means to destroy it and break down its

influence and alleged invulnerability. In this attack our microphones

have been invaluable in that they have provided intelligence informa-

tion as to the identity of members of La Cosa Nostra, the areas of

their influence, and their organization and activities. Knowledge

permits us to plan our attack and to probe vulnerable spots; also to

disrupt and harass the group and pass information along to trusted

local and state officials, who can act on it.

Above all, this

knowledge assists us in developing live informants. Originally we

were told we could not develop informants in La Cosa Nostra, but we

have developed 8 and will develop more. Any case for prosecution

will be based on live informants or evidence not flowing from micro-

phones; therefore, these cases will not be "tainted" and the government

should be able to

forestall any demand for information on these

techniques in court by stating the case rests on evidence which in

no way flowed from tainted sources.

The AG was advised that unless he wants to cut down on the

attack on organized crime, these microphones are necessary. The AG

inquired whether trespass was involved and the extent to which the

telephone companies had knowledge of our microphones. He was told

that trespass is involved in about 95% of the cases, and that we

seek to keep the telephone company in ignorance by merely leasing

Vlines without telling the phone company what they are for.

The AG said, after the discussion, that he would go ahead

He said he would rather know about these things, and

back the Bureau in its use of these techniques, than be in ignorance

Reference is made to my memorandum to you dated July 21, 1965, captionea

as above which furnished intormation in response to the Director's questions

concerning portions of Treasury Department testimony before the Long Committee.

Regarding refresher training of sound-trained Agents in connection with

regular In-Service, the Director noted "It must be stopped." Accordingly,

arrangements have been made with the Administrative Division and Training

Division for immediate discontinuance of this refresher training.'

In connection with a reference by an Internal Revenue Agent to a tape recorder

built in a brief case and the explanation that Bureau has some small recorders thai

may be transported in a brief case, the Director noted, 'None is to be used without

specific approval by Tolson. No more are to be acquired.'" This type of equipment

already requires prior Bureau approval for its use and the prior authorization

will in the future be obtained by interested Divisions from Mr. Tolson. Director's

instruction with reference to not acquiring additional small recorders is noted and

I no further recommendations for acquisition of equipment of this type will be submitted.

Relative to the infrared night viewing devices used by the Bureau to assist

in physically surveilling a darkened area, the Director noted, "No more are to be

acquired. Tolson must approve the use. " Instruction relative to approval procedure

is included in attached proposed SAC Letter. The Director's instruction with

reference to not acquiring additional infrared night viewing devices is noted and no

I further recommendations for acquisition of additional units will be submitted.!

In regard to the memorandum covering these items, Mr. Tolson noted

"Does the field get S' of G approval for use of this technical equipment?" and the

Director added "I would like to know. Any uses of the above devices must first

be approved by Tolson. "

In response to the Director's inquiry, coordination with other Divisions

at the Seat of Government reveals that Seat of Government approval for each

individual use of the night viewing devices and X-ray mirrors hasnot been

specifically required in the past; however, prior Seat of Government authorization

has been required for use of the small recorders. In the future, all such

authorization will be obtained by the interested Divisions from Mr.' T'olson.'

The attached proposed SAC Letter includes specific instructions that each

SUBJECT: POLYGRAPH MATTERS

m.

The Director instructed me to look into our use of the polygraph to determine

whether administrative controls are adequate. Purpose of this memorandum is to

reflect results of my inquiries.

• I have made a detailed review of our controls and have discussed all phases with

personnel involved. Briefly, all requests of the field to use the polygraph must be

approved by the appropriate Assistant Director, the Assistant to the Director and in

levery instance final approval must be made by Mr. Tolson.

Current control procedures were initiated and placed into effect by the Director,

and are much tighter than before as indicated by the comparison set out below.

the field decreasing sharply but also the percentage of approvals, i.e, from 65% in

January, 1965, to 19% in June, 1965. Many of the denials are made by the Assistant

Directors and by Mr. Belmont which

indicates the requests are being carefully

screened prior to being referred to Mr. Tolson for consideration.

OBSERVATIONS

In the light of the above, I am convinced that our use of the polygraph is being

held to the minimum and further that our administrative controls are completely

adequate to insure that there are no excesses.

RECOMMENDATION

None. Informative.

We will resume our selective use of the polygraph. Each request

from the field will be given most careful scrutiny. Where we

feel

the polygraph is essential to an investigation, a memorandum

will be prepared for Mi. Tolson requesting his approval for its use.

PORTABLE MICROPHONES AND

These techniques are only used sparingly and the Attorney

General has stated that where the use of these devices is necessary

and appropriate and do not involve trespass or questions of legality,

the Bureau should continue to use them without authorization from

the Special Agent in Charge with the following one exception to

insure tight control of its use: When a Field Office proposes to

use this technique in connection with a photographic surveillance of

a group meeting. it will be necessary for the

Upon authority of the special Agent an Charge, concealed

the field is under instruction that this technique

should be utilized only in those instances in which photographs of snort

subjects are not obtainable through ordinary sources. Where it is

desired to use this technique to photograph mass groups, prior Bureau

authority must be obtained, except in civil rights demonstrations when

the type of equipment is left to the discretion of the Special Agent in

the Attorney

Tenera SHOWN OTHERWISE

repized to

Bureau letter of 9/14/65 in which we pointed out that, in line with

the wishes of the AG and the concern of the President,

the FBI has

severely restricted and, in many instances, eliminated the use of

special investigative techniques.

In his letter the AG says he is completely in agreement that

undue limitation on special investigative techniques will make Lar

more difficult the protection of the country against subversion and

organized crime activities and, therefore, he sets forth his thoughts

and guidelines on these problems.

He refers to the hue and.cry raises

haranse of iniudicious use of these techniques by other agencies, but

states that the use of such techniques in proper circumstances is not

illegal and

in his judgment is appropriate and necessary.

Therefore,

he does not think it necessary for the Bureau to drastically limit the

use of such techniques and he will be happy to take full responsibiliti

fox their use under the guidelines he provided, namely

(1) Mail covers, trash covers, and polygraph tests are legal and

frequently useful investigative methods.

The AG sees no reason why

their judicious use should not be continued where the Bureau considers

it appropriate.

Similarly, information can and should be continued

to be obtained

from the Internal Revenue Service files, in accordance

with existing safeguards and limitations.

(2) The AG believes the Bureau should continue to use

portable

microphones or portable recorders where their use does not involve

trespass or questions of admissibility of evidence, or legality.

He

believes these

techniques should be used "without further authoriza

tion from me."

OBSERVATION:

In both category I and category

the AG is listing those

techniques which do not involve trespass or illegality.

In this same category would be such techniques as the

(3) The AG then comments on wiretaps and microphones involving

trespass which "present more difficult problems because of the

inadmissibility of any evidence obtained in court cases and because

of current judicial and public attitudes regarding their use."

He

understands that such devices will not be sed without his authoriza

tion.

He states that wiretaps and microphones should be confined to

national security matters; that he will continue to approve all such

requests in the future, as he has in the past, and he sees no need

curtall any such activities in the national security field. He

recognizes the value of these techniques in the investigation

no value of yao

of organized crime, but feels "in the light of the present atmosphere"

that efforts in the immediate future should be confined to national

security.

The AG says he will be happy to discuss the matter personally

with the Director, if desired.

UBSERVATION:

In this letter to us the AG is differentiating between two

(л)

types of

special investigative techniques,

(1) those involving

no trespass or question of legality, in which cases he authorizes

their use without further reference to him; and (2) those which do

involve trespass or a question of legality, in which cases he authorizes

their use in national security matters, subject in each case: to his

authorization. He says he will continue to approve requests of this

nature.

The AG apparently feels that he is on solid ground in

approving microphones and wiretaps in national security cases, but

lane meath me nation at to the taxe orant same

he is teariul of the Long Committee and attorneys such as Edward Bennett

crime field. His limitation as to the field of organized crime is

couched in terms "in the light of the present atmosphere I believe

that eiforts in the immediate future'

should be confined to national

security.

Therefore, this issue can be reopened when conditions

are more

favorable.

The AG does not cover in his reply the use of wiretaps in

kidnapings and cases involving jeopardy of human life. If such a

case comes up I think we can handle this by contacting the AG at that

Wtime, rather than raising the issue now.

The net effect of this letter from the AG is that he says

go ahead and use all of these investigative techniques judiciously, as

and

trespass to national security cases, and clear

each with him as in the past.

This has the effect of putting the AG

ion record, in writing.

that he recommends the use of these techniques

therefore, that we

as previously noted, the President's Foreign Intelligence

Advisory Board has this matter under study. While the AG's letter

of 9/27/65 has removed some of the restrictions which are of greatest

concern to the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, such as the

restriction on microphones in security cases, it would be highly

advantageous to the Bureau if we could have the Board carry through

its concern to the President.

The Board could advise the President

of the extreme value of the intelligence produced by the Bureau in

the past and the fart that, herause of the atmosphere created by the

Long Committee and the Gallagher Committee, and the concern ot the Aüs

I think this is highly important, not only because we must

have, and are entitled to, White House backing in this field, but

because our efforts go beyond those matters taken up with the AG;

fox example, our Anagram program, which is the surreptitious entry

Into foreign establishments to secure codes, et cetera.

We have held

up on this program recently, and yet it is of inestimable value to

the National Security Agency in its efforts to break into communica-

RECOMMENDATIONS:

I. At this point I see no reason for the Director to

personally discuss these matters further with the AG. The AG is on

record in writing and further discussion may obscure the commitment

he has made.

2. If the Director approves, I think we should advise Coyne

of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, of the essence

of the AG's reply to our letter.

Boyne and Di. Baker were advised

that we had written to the AG, but they were not furnished the details

of our letter.

As the AG has removed his restrictions, in the national

security field, we should advise Coyne, and at the same

time encourage

him to follow through to stress the value of our coverage to the

President.

3.

As to our

use of special investigative techniques, based

on the AG's letter of 9/27/65, we should approach such use with caution

and restraint, bearing in mind that we are still faced with the antics

of the Long Committee and the public atmosphere of opposition to

invasion of privacy. Therefore, we will present for the Director's

approval suggestions as to where we go trom here iu the uso vi these

techniques.

Essentially, we would keep a tight rein on the use of

special investigative techniques, with each case resting on its own

merits.

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach

RE:

Department's Rules Regarding Use

of Wiretaring and Other Electronic

Surveillance by the Executive Branch

DETAILS:

We have received a copy of the Attorney General's

newly formulated rules for the use of wiretap..ng and other

electronic surveillance devices, which rules

have been for-

warded by memorandum to the heads of executive departments and

agencies. The Attorney General notes that these rules are

consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Berger V.

New York, in which the Court ruled New York's law allowing

electronic eavesdropping under court order unconstitutional.

Specific note is also made that investigations directly related

to the protection of the national security are specifically

exempted from these rules, with existing procedures continuing

in force in that area.

The rules prohibit all wiretaping except where the

consent of one party has been obtained.

In such a case, each

agency is to adopt procedures to provide for advance approval

by the agency head for such an interception.

With regard to microphones and other electronic surveil

lance devices not involving a wiretap, the rules prohibit the

use of such devices when accomplished

by trespass into a

constitutionally protected area, including stuations involving

installation by penetration into a common wall. Note is made

that there is support for the view that any electronic eavesdropping

in a constitutionally protected area is a violation of the

Fourth Amendment, even though accomplished without physical

trespass or entry.

The rules also stated that even where no invasion of

a constitutionally protected area has occurred, surreptitious

electronic surveillance involving intrusion into a privileged

relationship (attorney-client, et cetera) may violate rights

provided for by the First, Fifth and Sixth Amendments.

is followed up by a statement that the use of such devices by

Federal personnel to overhear or record nontelephone conver-

sations involving a violation of the Constitution or a

statute is prohibited.

In noting that certain uses of electronic devices

are legal, the rules cite Lopez V. United States and Osborn

Re:

Department's Rules Regarding Use

of Wiretapping and Other Electronic

Surveillance by the Executive Branch

to be legal if the consent of a party to the conversation had

been obtained (body recorders and similar situations).

• In order to limit the legal use of electronic surveil-

lances, the rules provide that the advance written approval of

the Attorney General for any use of electronic or mechanical

devices to overhear nontelephone conversations without the con-

sent of all parties must be obtained. Such requests for advance

Attorney General approval must be submitted in writing by the

head of the requesting agency and shall contain justification

for the proposed use;

type of equipment to be used; identity of

person involved; proposed location; duration of proposed use,

and manner and method of installation.

In emergency situations, the agency head may authorize

the use of such devices to overhear or record nontelephone con

versations without the consent of all parties provided that,

within 24 hours, the above-mentioned written requirements are

submitted to the Attorney General together with an explanation

why the situation qualified as an emergency.

Where Attorney General approval has been granted, and

such devices are used within the scope of these rules, the

responsible agent or agents shall, where technically feasible,

record the conversations by means of a permanent tape or record.

Such tapes or records shall be preserved and a written report

setting forth the actual use is to be submitted to the agency

involved. Such reports,

tapes, logs, transcripts, summarj

memoranda and similar material

shall

be specially

classified,

filed and safeguarded,

and shall not be made available to

agency personnel or others except where "essential to Government

operations." A record is to be maintained concerning each person

to whom such information or material has been made available.

Further provisions are made to insure that each agency

head will be responsible for limiting the procurement of devices

primarily designed to be used

surreptitiously to overhear oi

record conversations to the minimum necessary for use consistent

with these rules.

In addition, such devices are to be stored

in a limited number of locations to insure effective administrative

control.

Memorandum to Mr. Conrad

Re:

DEPARTMENT'S RULES REGARDING USE OF WIRETAPPING AND OTHER

ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH

DETAILS:

Memorandum J. H. Gale to Mr. DeLoach, dated June 28,

1967, summarized the Attorney General's newly formulated rules

for the use of wiretapping and other electronic surveillance

devices.

The memorandum

recommended that Laboratory and Files

and Communications Divisions set up any procedures necessary

for compliance with the Department's instructions concerning

the preservation of logs, tapes, etc., and the maintenance of

inventory records. Mr. Tavel's memorandum to Mr. Mohr, 7/17/67,

advised the Attorney General of our present record-keeping

procedures and our interpretation of his instructions.

The

procedures recommended herein concerning inventory records

are in keeping with the procedures and interpretation set forth

in Mr. Tavel's memorandum.

Basically, the Attorney General's instructions require

that records be maintained in the field and at headquarters for

a period of six years identifying each item of technical

equipment on hand, place where stored, dates assigned for use,

identity of all persons using same, manner in which used,

maintenance of tape recordings or other permanent record

results obtained through its use, and yearly reporting of

this information to the attorney

General.

In the Attorney General's memorandum, under Section Ili,

National Security, the statement is made, "The

foregoing rules

have been tormulated with respect to all agency investigations

other than investigations directly related to the protection

of the national security."

This instruction exempts equipment

used solely in'national security investigations from the special

inventory and record requirements enumerated in the Attorney

General's memorandum.

There is currently in the field only that technical

equipment which has been

authorized for use in connection with

national security investigations.

This equipment is afforded

strict control in accordance with long-standing Bureau policies.

Current administrative and inventory policies in respect to the

use and control of this equipment are adequate and no new

procedures need be established to comply with the instructions

or the intent of the Attorney General's memorandum.

Memorandum to Mx. Conrad

RE:

DEPARTMENT'S RULES REGARDING USE OF WIRETAPPING AND OTHER

ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH

The technical equipment maintained at the SOG for

dispatch to the field as needed is available and suitable for

use in either national security investigations or in other

investigative matters not related to maintenance of the national

security. However, limitations placed on the use of technical

equioment by the Attorney General all but eliminate any use of

this equipment except in national security matters. Accordingly,

there appears no reason to regard any of our technical equipment

as falling within the category requiring detailed record of use

and yearly reporting to the Attorney General unless and until

such equipment is actually used in a nonsecurity-type investigation.

At such time that any item of technical equipment is so used, it

will become subject to the special inventory requirements

specified by the Attorney General and appropriate records of

the equipment use will be maintained.

The following procedure is proposed for control of

technical equipment authorized for use in investigative matters

not directly related to protection of the national security:

The division handling the authorization should advise

the Laboratory and Adninistrative Divisions whenever use of any

technical equipment is authorized.

Necessary items of equipment

will then be supplied to the field from soG stock. At that time,

the Laboratory will provide the Property Management Unit of

the

Administrative Division and the field office receiving the

equipment with equipment identitication data and advise that

the equipment is subject to special inventory control in

accordance with the Attorney General's instructions. All

equipment will be returned to SoG by the field upon termination

of use for which authorized. The returned equipment will be

retained at SOG for use in other nonsecurity investigative

matters, or as conditions warrant, will be restored to stock

for use

in matters relating to protection of the national security.

A subsection of the inventory cards should be set up

in the Property Management Unit, in which to maintain Ior a

period of six years the inventory cards containing the record

of movement and use of the technical equipment utilized in

nonsecurity investigations.

The above procedure will provide strict control over

equipment and will insure that appropriate records of movement,

storage, and use are maintained in accordance with the attorney

General's instructions.

MEMORANDUM TO THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE

DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES

• Re: Monitoring Private Conversations with

the Consent of a Party

This memorandum concerns the investigative use of

electronic and mechanical devices secretly to overhear,

transmit, or record private conversations when one or more.

of the parties to the conversation is a Federal agent or

is cooperating with a Federal agent and has consented to the

overhearing, transmitting, or recording of the conversation.

This memorandum does not restrict any form of monitoring when

all parties to the conversation consent, nor does it affect

existing instructions on the related matter of electronic

surveillance without the consent of any party to a conversation.

(See Manual for Conduct. of Electronic Surveillance under

Title III of Public Law 90-357; and Outline of Duties and

Responsibilities of Attorneys and Agency Personnel Involved in

I. The Law On Monitoring Private Conversations

with the Consent of a Party

The Supreme Court of the United States has for

some time distinguished between electronic surveillance of

a conversation without the consent of any of the participants,

which in most circumstances is constitutionally impermissible

without court order, and the monitoring of a conversation

with the consent of one but not all of the participants.

See On Lee, y. United States, 343 U.S. 747 (1952) (informant

carrying concealed transmitter); Lopez v. United States,

373 U.S. 427 (1963) (agent carrying concealed recorder);

Rathbun v. United States, 355 U.S. 107 (1957) (police officer

listening on extension telephone). While the decisions in

the cases involving consensual monitoring have been predicated

on various grounds, it is apparent that the central difference

between consensual monitoring and non-consensual electronic

surveillance is that in the consensual situations there

exists one party to the conversation who is working with the

government and who will relate to the government the substance

of the conversation, and that in such situations the monitoring

serves simply to provide instantaneous communication and to

assure effective corroboration. The government in such

situations gains access

to no information it would not otherwise

have obtained; it simply obtains it faster and in a more probative

HH 55230

DocId: 32989655

## Page 53

form. This essential difference was recently

emphasized by

the Supreme Court United States v. White, 401

U.S.C 745 (1977)

decided April 5, 1971, in which the Court held that a Federal

agent could properly testify to statements he had

verheard

a defendant make to a government informer by means of a

secret transmitting device which the informer had concealed

on his person at the time. Announcing the judgment of the

Court, Mr. Justice White stated:

Concededly a police agent who conceals

his police connections may write down for

• official use his conversations.with a defendant

and testify concerning them, without a

warrant authorizing his encounters with

the defendant and without otherwise violating

the latter's Fourth Amendment rights.

* *

For constitutional purposes, no

different result is required if tha

agent instead of immediately reporting

and transcribing his conversations with

defendant, either (1) simultaneously

records them with electronic equiament

which he is carrying on his person,

* * * (2) or carries radio equipment

which simultaneously transmits the

conversations aither to recording

equipment located elsewhere or to

other agents monitoring the transmitting

frequency. * * * If the conduci and

revelations of an agent operating

without, electronic enuipment do not

invade the defendant's constitutionally

justifiable expectations of privacy,

neither does a simultaneous recording

of the same conversations made by the

agent or by others from transmissions

received from the agent to whom the

defendant is talking and whose

trustworthiness the defendant necessarily

risks.

HH 55230 Do0Id:32989655 Page 53

---

## Page 54

-4 -

* * *[The law permits the frustration

of actual expectations of privacy by

permitting authorities to use testimony

of those associates who. for one reason

or another have determined to turn to

the use of informants * **. If the,

law gives no protection to the wrongdoer

whose trusted accomplice is or becomes

a police agent, neither should it

protect him when that same agent has

recorded or transmitted the conversations

which are later offered in evidence to

prove the State's case. [Citations omitted]

The Court in White, after noting that there was no

constitutional prohibition against the monitoring of conversations

with the consent of one party, called attention to Titie III

of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.

That statute, in the subsection enacted as 2571(2) of

Title 18 of the United States Code, excepted consensual

monitoring from

(d) •It shall not be unlawful under this

chapter for a person not acting under color

party to the communication or where one

## Page 55

-5 -

unless such communication is intercepted

for the purpose of committing any criminal

or tortious act in violation of the

Constitution or lairs of the United States

or of any State or for the purposes of

•committing any other injurious act.

•II. Administrative Regulations Concerning

Consensual Monitoring Conversations.

The monitoring of conversations with the consent

of one of the participants is a particularly effective and

reliable investigative technique, and its use by Federal

agents in investigating criminal cases is encouraged where

appropriate and is expected where necessary. Nevertheless,

although it is clear that such monitoring is constitutionally

and statutorily permissible - and therefore that it may be

conducted without judicial warrant - it is appropriate that

this investigative technique continue to be the subject of

careful

self-regulation by the Executive Branch of the Federal

Government. Accordingly, the following restrictions will

apply in all criminal investigations employing the consensual

monitoring of conversations.

•(a) Conversations other than telephone conversations.

All Federal departments and agencies shall, except

in exigent circumstances as discussed: below, obtain the

advance authorization of the Attorney General or any designated

Assistant Attorney General before using any mechanical or

HH 55230 DocId: 32989655 Page 55

---

## Page 56

.

-6 -

electronic device to overhear, transmit, or record private

conversations other than telephone conversations without

the consent of all the participants. Such authorization is

required before employing any such device, whether it is

carried by the cooperating participant or whether it is installed

on premises under the control of the participant.

Requests for authorization to monitor private

conversations shall be addressed to the Attorney General,

in writing, by the head of the department or agency responsible

for the investigation, or his delegate, and shall state:

1. The reason why monitoring appears desirable,

the means by which it would be conducted,

the place in which it would be conducted;

and its expected duration.

2. The names of the persons whose conversations

would be monitored and their roles in the

matter under investigation. When the

name of the non-consenting party or parties

is not known at the time the request for

authorization is made, the department or agency

making the request shall supply such information

to the Attorney General within 30 days after the

termination of tha monitoring.

MH 55230 DocId: 32989655

Page 56

---

## Page 57

- 7 -

3. That it is the considered judgment of the

person making the request that monitoring

is warranted in the interest of effective

•law enforcement.

Requests for authorization will receive prompt

consideration by the Attorney General or his designee. To

assure adequate time for considering a request and for

notifying the requesting department or agency of the appropriate

decision, it is important that each request be received by.

the Office of the Attorney General no less than 48 hours prior

to the time of the intended monitoring. It should be clearly

understood that the use of consensual devices will not be

authorized retrospectively.

Where a request cannot be made in compliance with the

48-hour requirement, or in exigent circumstances precluding

request for authorization in advance of the monitoring --

such as the imminent loss of essential evidence or a threat

to the immediate safety of an agent or informant - emergency

monitoring may be instituted under the authorization of the

head of the responsible department or agency or other agency

official or officials designated by him. The Attorney General or

his designee shall be notified promptly of any such monitoring

H# 55230 DocId:32989655 Page 57

---

## Page 58

-8-

and of the specific conditions that precluded obtaining advance

approval, and shall be afforded the information enumerated

above that would-have been given in requesting advance

approval.

Each department and agency should develop procedures

to assure that under such exigent circumstances its agents

will be capable of acting expeditiously. The Attorney General.

or his designee shall be kept advised as to the identity of

those officials who have been designated by department or

agency heads to authorize such emergency monitoring.

(b) Telephone conversations.

Telephone conversations -- because they involve the

transmission of the participants' conversations through a

complex and far-flung network of wires, the common use of

multi-party lines and extension telephones, and the possibility

of an unseen participant permitting another person to listen

at the same telephone -- have long been considered not to

justify the same assumption of privacy as a face-to-face

• conversation. Nevertheless, there is still a need to provide

for the supervision and control of consensual monitoring of

telephone conversations. Accordingly, the current practice of

charging each department and agency with the control of such

consensual monitoring by its agents will continue.. Each

department and agency head shall assure the adoption or the

HN 55230

DooId:32989655

Page

58

---

## Page 59

continuation of agency rules on this subject. Such rules shall

also provide for the expeditious, oral authorization of such

monitoring where necessitated by exigent circumstances.

Ill. Security of monitoring devices.

It shall be the responsibility of the head of

each investigating agency to procure and maintain only the

minimum number of devices designed for the consensual

monitoring of conversations that the agency reasonably needs,

consistent with current policy, to overhear, transmit, or record

private conversations for investigative purposes. The

equipment shall be stored, as feasible, in one central location

or in

a limited number of locations so as to facilitate

administrative control.

An inventory shall be maintained on a current basis

at each location at which monitoring equipment is stored.

All equipment must be accounted for at all times.

When

equipment is withdrawn from storage a record shall be made

as to the times of withdrawal and of its return to storage.

By written report, the agent to whom the equipment is assigned

shall account fully

for the time he possessed the monitoring

equipment and the uses he made of it. Equipment should be

returned to storage when not in actual use except to the extent

that returning the equipent would interfere with its proper

utilization.

HN 55230 DooId:32989655

Page 59

## Page 60

- 10 -

Each agency shall maintain copies of

, the complete

inventories of equipment showing the times of withdrawals

and returns, and copies of the written reports of the

responsible agents specifying the uses made of

tht

equipment.

Such-records should be retained for at least six years.

IV. Annual Reports.

The head of each investigative agency, or his

delegate, shall submit to the Attorney General during July

of each year a report containing (1) an inventory of all

the agency's electronic and mechanical equipment designed for

the monitoring of conversations, and (2) a brief statement of

the results obtained during the prior fiscal year by the

use of such investigative monitoring.

this subject.

With respect to consensual monitoring of telephone conversations:

the referenced memorandum indicates that the Attorney General is pre-

pared to give the investigating agency authority to set up its own controls.

Such authority is what the FBI asked for in its letter to the Attorney

General dated August 18, 1972, which letter is cited in the referenced

memorandum. However, referenced memorandum suggests that for the

time being the approval of the Acting Director or Acting Associate Director

should be obtained prior to consensual monitoring of telephone conversations..

Since this issue was apparently resolved prior to August 18,

1972, in favor of giving SAC's or persons acting in their behalf the authority

to authorize consensual monitoring where telephone conversations were

involved and since I am not aware of any subsequent developments which

warrent a reconsideration of the FBI's proposal in this regard, I recommend

that the authority_to_authorize consensual monitoring of telephone con-

versations be delegated to the Field as recommended to the Attorney

General back in August:

REC14 66-8160-3450

I have previously indicated my reasons for favoring such a

delegation, which advocacy is based primarily on the belief that the

requirement of obtaining clearance from Headquarters can as a practical

matter cause Agents in the Field to have to forego consensual monitoring

in circumstances where such monitoring would be a valuable investigative

technique.

By letter to the Attorney General dated August 18, 1972, it was

pointed out that the FBI is fully aware of the need for administrative

restraint in the use of consensual monitoring of telephone and non-

telephone conversations. It was suggested that such restrictions could

be continued by delegating responsibility to approve consensual monitoring

of non-telephone communications in FBI cases personally to the Director of

the FBI, the Acting Director of the FBI or other official of the FBI acting

in the absence of the Director. It was further requested that the Attorney

General authorize the Director to delegate to the Special Agents in Charge

or those acting in behalf of the Special Agents in Charge the authority co

authorize.consensual_monitoring.of telephone conversations

By letter dated October 18, 1972, Assistant Attorney General

Henry E. Petersen acknowledged our letter of August 18, 1972, and

furnished a copy of new instructions to heads of executive departments

and agencies, superseding instructions that had previously been issued

June 16, 1967. Briefly, these new instructions provide that in the case

of conversations other than by telephone the authorization for the moni-

toring must be obtained from the Attorney General or an Assistant

Attorney General on at least 48 hours advance notice and on a statement

of why, where, and when the monitoring will be done and on what persons

In emergency situations agencies were given the authority to designate

someone to give this authorization, to be followed by prompt notification.

to the Attorney General.

The new instructions also called for the maintenance of an inven-

tory of all equipment used in such monitoring and also called for an annual

report containing an inventory of all the agencies' electronic and mechanical

equipment designed for the monitoring of conversation

Memorandum tu aIr. Felt

RE: CONSENSUAL MONITORING OF TELEPHONE AND

NON-TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS

Inspector Number Oe Man A. A. Staffeld and the writer talked to

Assistant Attorney General Petersen and Harold Shapiro, one of his deputies,

on the afternoon of November 6, 1972. It was pointed out that the FBI had.

previously been exempted from submitting such a yearly report and the

maintenance of such an inventory, and a letter had been forwarded to the

Attorney General July 2, 1969, in this regard. Both Petersen and Shapiro

stated that the latest instructions were not meant to change the exemption

previously given the FBI in 1969, because to require such reports from the

FBI would be duplicative and overlapping. They advised that they would

furnish the FBI a current letter reiterating that the FBI is exempted.

It was also pointed out to Petersen and Shapiro that the new instruc-

tions called for notification in writing to the Attorney General 48 hours prior

to the utilization of consensual monitoring of non-telephone conversations.

Again they pointed out they had included these instructions as a guideline for

agencies, other than the FBI, who had a habit of mailing letters to the

Attorney General that would arrive at the Department too late for authori-

zation by the Attorney General. They stated that this has never been the

problem with the FBI as we are located in the same building, and that they

will give us approval on these just as they have in the past provided the

Attorney General or his designee is available. They were advised that in

emergency situations where there was not sufficient time to obtain this

authority that the authority of the Acting Director or the Acting Associate

Director would be obtained and the Attorney General thereafter advised.

With regard to consensual monitoring of telephone conversations,

the Attorney General states the investigating agency may set up its own

controlst is suggested that for the time being we continue to require the

authority of the Acting Director or Acting Associate Director.

ACTION:

(1) No change will be made in the Bureau's current practice with

regard to inventory or submission of annual reports, and a letter will be

obtained from the Department renewing the FBI's exemption in this regard.

(2) We will continue to obtain authority from the Attorney General

in connection with consensual monitoring of non-telephone conversations

just as we have before, so long as the Attorney General is available. In

emergency situations the authority of the Acting Director or the Acting

Associale Director will be obtained and the Attorney General will there-

after be advised promptly.
