April 1977

SUBJECT: Theory re MOSKALEV, Yuriy Ivanovich and

Unidentified Man

That Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV might be identifiable with

the "unidentified man" going into and coming out of the Soviet

Embassy in Mexico City in October 1963. The "unidentified man"

was recently identified by SLIPSTREAM as a KGB type by name of

"Yuri" whom he knew in Moscow in 1964.

According to travel records MOSKALEV was in the

USSR in 1964; in the U.S. in October 1963 .

MOSKALEV functions officially as a Soviet scientist

and often attends international conferences. He

has been in contact with known GRU Soviet diplomat in

the U.s.

MOSKALEV bears a striking resemblance to composite of

"Saul" in book Appointment in Dallas who claims he was involved

in the assassination of President Kennedy. "Saul" claims:

-

he crossed border into U.S. illegally and was in

Dallas on 20 November.

- That he had been to Mexico City, had a contact in

Soviet Embassy there, in 1963, and that he knew the

identity of OSWALD because he (OSWALD) had been

fingered to him in Mexico City.

---

## Page 7

14-00000

:2 -

- that OSWALD was involved in the Kennedy assassination

plot, but that he, "Saul", fired shots that killed

Kennedy.

that two hours after the assassination he, "Saul",

was out of the U.S.

That he used limp as a

disguise.

QUESTIONS

1. Could MOSKALEV be "Saul"?

2. Could MOSKALEV, therefore, be mystery man who

boarded plane in Mexico City for Havana on 22

November 1963?

3. Was assassination a Soviet comspiracy without

Cuban knowledge?

RECOMMENDATION

1. Can we obtain voice tape of MOSKALEV, since he

has delivered speeches at scientific conferences

in U.S. and abroad?

2.

If so, could we arrange to have McDonald (unwittingly)

hear it, to see if he recognizes it as that of "Saul"?

Get photos and check out MOISEEV and BABKOV.

Via CI Staff, find out if we can show photo to DERYABIN

Could MOSKALEV be Dept 13? Could OSWALD have met with

him in Mexico City clandestinely in 1963?

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Possible Identity of the "Unidentified Man

Photographed in Mexico City in October 1963

REFERENCES: A. Photos Taken in Mexico City by Mexico City

Station

B. Paperback Book "Appointment in Dallas"

C. Soft File, Headquarters Information on

Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALIV, Possible

"Unidentified Man"

1. Photographs of the unidentified nan were taken by

our Mexico City Station on 2,3,4, and 15 October 1963, going

into or coming out of both the Cuban and Soviet Embassies in

Mexico City. Copies were provided to the FBI in Dallas.

Texas on 22 November 1963. Although cropped copies have

appeared in various works, including Volume XX, page 691, of

the Warren Commission Report, and the book "Appointment in

Dallas", to our knowledge the individual has never beeni

identified.

2. On 17 March 1977, a former member of the Cuban General

Directorate of Intelligence (DGI) recognized photographs of

the unidentifie man as Yuri LNU, a KGB officer, whom he met

in Moscow in 1964 while attending an intelligence course

there. He said that Yuri, a fluent English and Spanish

speaker, was acting as a trouble shooter for the Cukan grouD.

about 15, attending the course. Yuri lived with

. - 2 -

the Cuban and Bulgarian groups quartered in the same building

in Moscow. Any time the Cubans had a problem, Yuri would solve

it for them. Yuri was a good friend of Juan (pseudo) a KGB

officer who taught the Cubans about the Agency (CIA) and the

West German intelligence apparatus. Juan told the DGI member

that he had served in Mexico for about 20 years and in the U.S.

• clandestinely for about 10 years (specific dates unknown). Yuri

was entrusted with their welfare only, and did not attend classes

with the Cuban group.

3. SE/X travel records were reviewed in search of an

individual by the name of Yuri who possibly fit the description

of the unidentified man. This lead to an individual by the

name of Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV, a Soviet, reportedly a Doctor

of Medical Sciences, who has participated in international

scientific conferences for the USSR since 1962 or earlier.

Although there is no official 201 file on MOSKALEV, there is a

sizable dossier on him in the Central Reference Service. Many

of the documents in his dossier are 00 reports from U.S.

scientists concerning MOSKALEV's attendance and behavior at

scientific meetings. It is obvious that he has a much greater

knowledge of the English language than he admits. His capability

is said to improve greatly after a few drinks; however, it is

noted that he rarely, if ever, drank at the scientific meetings.

It is also noted that on

• occasions he reportedly was not

qualified to represent the Soviets at a particular conference.

His papers rarely, if ever, were specific, or presented new data.

In December 1963 the FBI reported

In October 1963 MOSKALEV was a

delegate

the

IAEA Symposium on Neutron Irradiation, Brookhaven, Long Island,

New York.

Described by U.S. scientists as very sharp, MOSKALEV

was a frequent commentator on other people's work and made

a practice of denigrating their reports with respect to

radiation

• lethality.

d. In October 1967 MOSKALEV participated in the Second

International Symposium on Delayed Effects of Bone Seeking Radio

Nuclides, Sun Valley, Idaho, arriving two days early.

travelled ai

•• Sun Valley and appare. was able to use

his knowledge of the English language to get along on his own.

Although he complained about not I-nowing much English, he

admitted writing the English version of the paper he presented.

MOSKALEV attempted to make propaganda of a paper by a West •

German scientist.

A respected U.S. scientist said he fran'-ly

did not believe MOSKALEV's findings. MOSKALEV took copious

notes on

all papers, which indicated he understood what was

going

on .

He also

took many pictures with a 35 mm camera.

From questions MOSKALEV asked, it was obvious that he new

English quite well. Although considerable time was

spent

arranging for MOSKALEV to visit a U.S. laboratory en route

to

his home, he took a different route,

without telling anyone

FBI

of his plans, and did not visit the lal.

4. On 23 March 1977 several identification experts of

the Disguise and Identification Section of OTS/GAD compared

photos of the unidentified man with photos of My Yuriy

Ivanovich MOSKALEV from the FBI,

Liaison, and CRS.

It was their opinion that MOSKALEV could very likely ke

identifiable with the unidentified man.

5. Page 59 of the book "Appointment in Dallas," shows an

Identi-Kit Model composite of an individual who told the

author in London in 1972 that he was involved in the assassination

of President Kennedy. The composite of that individual (code

name "Saul"), whose real name is unknown to the author, kears

a striking resemblance to the photos of Yuri! Ivanovich

MOSKALEV. According to the author "Saul"identified the

picture shown in the Warren Commission Exhil it #237 as

having been taken at the Russian Embassy in Mexico City,

either in the foyer or just outside.

6. The author of the afor mentoned book, lugh C. Melonald,

is the inventor of the Identi-kit and at one time was under

contract to CIA in regard to the Identi-Kit. McDonald clims

in his book that he met "Saul" at an office in CIA Headquarters

sometime after the Bay of Pigs invasion, and that a colleague

of McDonald told him that "Saul" was an assassin.

7. There are striking parallels between the backgrounds

of "Saul" as given in McDonald's book, and MOSKALEV.

For example:

"Sau!"

Pg. T - CIA allegedlj; knew

of Saul. McDonald said he first

met Saul in CIA Has. CIA took

picture of Saul that started

McDonald's investigation.

claimed started his investigation.

composite of "Saul".

CDH comment: See photos of

Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV. He

bears striking resemblance to

"Saul."

Helms, the DDP testified under oath

that he didn't know "Saul."

Pg. 60/61 - McDonald states it

was obvious that FBI and CIA

were compromised at the very

top since both Agencies denied

knowledge of "Saul". Noone wanted

to hear anymore about him.

said, with a call from an unident

tified woman who arranged a meeting

in London and told him she believed

the Russians had a germ warfare

installation in Vozrozdenya, in

the Aral Sea. McDonald obtained

CIA approval to make contact.

Pg. 70 - In Germany in 1945

McDonald knew of 12 people

(poles, Czechs, Rumanians,

Germans, Scandinavians, 2 Russians)

who feared and hated Russia. They

and report all future activities

within Russia and Russia sphere

of control. Most had legitimate

jobs.

Pg. 71 - 24 Sept 70 McDonald

left for London with "Saul's"

picture. McDonald said both he

and Saul were contract men for

CIA. Saul did dangerous jobs

for private interests.

"Saul's" statement that long

before the Warren Commission even

existed he had been told that

there was a possibility that

1. On 23 March,

of Latin America Division handcarried

photographs to OTS/GAD for identification comparison. These photos were

examined by the undersigned and two identification experts of the Disguise

and Identification Section.

2. The results of the comparison is as follows:

Facial Shape - Close similarities, although there are slight

differences which are probably due to subject's age differences.

B. Chin - Fair similarities-the loss of muscletone due to ageing

is most apparent here.

C. Hair Line - Again good similarity with the natural ravages of

time factored in.

D. Set and Proportion of Eyes and Eyebrows - Close similarities.

(Comparison of eve detail is not possible due to poor photo quality)

E. Nose and Caliper Lines - Close similarities in the nose but

the younger man has no sign of the distinctive caliper lines which extend

from the nose to either side of the mouth on the known Soviet. This could

be explained by loss of muscletone and/or differences in lighting.

the whole are too these pete more to the eyes in can i puth and

the most distinctive characteristic of both subjects.

Here the similarities

are very close.

Drs. Donald Van Dyke, James MoRae, and Howard Parker took them on a short

tour of the Anger camera facility and whole-body counting and scanning

equipment. The current uses and potential in medical diagnosis were dis-

cussed.

Major questions concerned the use of these instruments in monit

Lunch was attended by Dr. Hardin Jones, the four guests, Drs. Van Dyke and

Parker, and Dr. Patricia Durbin, who acted as hostess and guide through

the day. Topics discussed at lunch were centered about the Transuranium

symposium. The efficacy of two new techniques to remove lung contamina

tion by-alpha-emitting isotopes was considered.

The two techniques are

dose levels in the study.

A two-hour general discussion between and among the four guests

elements among species.

The usefulness and verifiability of models of

Lafuma explained that from his point of view he was concerned with only

two prinary aspects of human contact with plutonium, inhalation and wounds.

His studies have shown, of course, that the earlier trcatment is begun the

better the results; but also he has found 1t caster to decontaminate an

area of the body exposed to plutonium through contact or a wound than to

remove It from the lungs.

Lafuma has used

intravenous Injection exclusively

for the treatment of wounds and finds that a very significant amount of the

transuranium particles are discharged from the body in urine.

For the treatment

of inhaled particles, Lafuma has used both DTPA aerosola and

injection.

his results

from Injection are better than the use of aerosole, even 1n luag

are important, because they are related to the ability to suppress Immunity

bielory which is interested in the why of differences of biological

of denigrating the reports

is these people with respect to radiation lethality

His comment was to

we arrest that the stucies of radiation lethality done usually in small

inianlo tors not to the point, were not germane to problems in the

trian case, and that to be useful these studies should be done

in animals

closer to man.

What is your critique of his argument?

"oll, a mass of work has been done with the smaller animals in variuos

a genuine scientific position?

so can say? In their published work the Soviets show a lot of attention

to effects in the central nervous system-they are very interested in

this and US people have tended to ignore this area.. So conceivably:

loskaley, both fron the papers he gave and his questions and comments

In asscussion,

indicated that it was very siamp.

very auvanced in his

knowlerge of the biological effects of radiation, particularly with

respect to distinguishing among the effects of various energies of

neutrons and the techniques for reasuring these energies.

I think it

may be safely assumed that the Russians are using very advanced methods

for detecting and measuring the various energies of neutrons--the

dosintry of neutrons. In the biological effect, I think they are

way behind us.

But they are much involved in the potentials of neutron

irradiation and their objectives are, I am sure, the effects of space

radiation

25°

Actually, IV PJ Afanas yev, who is a physicist, was even more sophisticate:

Afanas'yev's paper was entitled "Production and investiga-

tion of Dose Fields for Ixradiation of Ixperimental Animals with Protons

of High Energy".

His paper showed that both their production of high

energy protons in the laboratory and the measurements of these protons

with respect

to animal work is sophisticated.. They are advanced in this.

I think this is the distinction to be made: tiey are more advanced in

the technology of producing high energy radiations and the measurement

of these than they are in biological effects of radiation.

Q. Was anything reported on effects of radiation on non-regenerative tissues

such as the brain?

Áo

The kussians are very much involved in CNS effects of radiation, but they

presented no data at the Symposium.

The paper that lioskalev gave was

a survey of Russian research work on biological action of neutrons and

isotopes-

It covered maybe twenty different pieces of work with only

a few sentences for each.

anas ye parented no elder and othiented th

data on the production of dose fields with high energy protons.

27.

One, gets the impression that whereas Russians physics is mechanistic

md quite indistinguishable fron ours in that respect,

Russian biology

35. ampregnated with philosophy

doskalev, for example, spoke of how

the body

"adapts" to radiation in the sense that a single animal adapts.

Most, biologists will reserve this vord to changes in a species over a

very long period. I suppose you could consider wound healing as

adaptation in a sense

But wester: biology. sees. certain events:

occuring in an organism as the consequence: ofin wound which can be

described withuut resort to notims of teleological adaptation. This

philosophical tendency has been a damaging element in Russian biology,

I believe.

23. Q. Here there results in the use of drugs in radiation protection?

I can, recall nothing on protective drugs from'anybody.

There was here

and there a reporting of drugs used to enhance the effect of radiation

with respect to tumor treatment..

Was anything presented on the characteristics of a bio-element used for

space radiation detection including the number required for an extended •

space probe and the method of transmitting information?

A.

I am afraid I do not understand the question.

30. Q.

l'as there anything on biological indicators at

low ranges of radiation

doses?

A.

There is a tremendous amount of interest in such indicators everywhere.

so presumably they are not concerned with these.

Piople from other countries, and particularly the US, reported work

irving to do with low dose effects and reliable biological indicators

for low ranges of dose using the chromosome aberration methods in human

.calls. but the Russians had nothing to say about this particular thing

ind seem not to be working on it as yet.

In your opinion; what is the level of accomplishment, worldwide, in this

Matter of getting reliable indicators of biological damage?

Insofar as I know, the most sensitive and reliable biological index for

smare at low dose rates involves the study

of chromosome abnormalities.

Tie approach was developed in the US and is being used extensively here

and in england, and ether countries are taking it up Moreover, I tbiTik.

From shat I know of Russian radi biology from

translations and

exclude their reiated

physical work from this judgment.

33. Q-

Has there reporting from the Soviets on types of radiation detection

equipment used in the Vostok flights?

rulativa biological effectiveness factor values for neutrons, protons

and cosmic ray attenuations?

Hell, errin, there was no specific mention of this, but the interest in

the rolative biological effectiveness factor for neutrons and cosnic

was a major concer of the whole Symposium:

the attempt to

slucidute the IBE factor and particularly the problem with respect to

there is this discrepancy, and it may be pronising for large animal

research. Harwell, my laboratory, and the Argonne National Laboratory

near Chicago are now setting up to apply low dose rate neutrons in

sheep.. This will be new work and should have important results.

neutrons there is this question of REE and it was one of the major

points of discussion at the Symposium.

39. Q. Did the Soviets say

anything bearing on physical measurements of

radiation in space in terms of relative biological effectiveness factor

and implications for future manned space flights?

A. All I can say is that it is logical to suppose that this is what they

are after:

good physical measurements of radiation of

a type that

might be anticipated in space.

40. Qo Was there anything said on mapping and profiles for space radiation?.

A. There was nothing on this.

41. Q. What interest have the Soviets shown in development and testing of nuclear

power sources

for thermionic pover generators?

Are the Soviets now

applying such generators?

A. There was nothing on this.

42. Q. Did the Soviets report progress in radiation resistant materials and

components for application to long space flight

electronic equipment?

1. This Symposium was all biological, so there was nothing on this.

13: Q. Was thare anything from the Soviets on methods of radiation shielding?

.. No.

44. Q.

It was there by implication. The fact that they were talking about the

investigation

of dose fields, the

protons of high. energy, implies that they rould be using some kind of

shielding to get the animal exposed.

This contribution would have been in Afanas'yev's paper "Production and

Investigation of Dose Fields for Irradiation of Experimental Animals

with Protons of High Energy"?

Aa. Yes.

This is apparently due to the high acceptence of data pub

Iished by the University of Rochester.

It was pointed out

that the possible contribution of radioactive dust composed

of other than radon daughters was not actually evaluated

samples were not collected. Although radon is releesed by

ministration of the isotopes, although a few inhalation

studies were described.

These papers were all given by

DI L N Busykina in the absence of Drs Moskalev

, Sanotsisy,

NoviRova and bustureve.

They report that Tu co 18 per cent/

of the inhaled radioactivity was found in the lungs of rats

and dogs after exposure, and that five per cênt was cleared

by cillasy activity.

These data are difficult to evaluate

since the particle sizes of the aerosols were broadly des

cribed as being bedreen 1 and 4. Translosation of the

Inhaled radioisotopes was similar to that reported by others.

Biological effects were reported only for intratracheal ad

ministration of Cel44 and Ru106.. They report degenerative

inflarmation of the lung and aplastic changes in the bone

marrow accompanied by leukopenla in acute stages. In longer

term studies they find chronic peumonia and degenerative

and proliferative changes

of the bronchial epitheliun and

connective tissue.

They also reported reduction of bone
