They are given open U.S. assistance to remain in this country, yet

are participating in covert actions in a limited way. Only a fractional

opening has been made to release the frustrated energy of these refugees

in freeing their homeland and in creating a favorable political climate in

Latin America for the liberation of Cuba. Policy limitations of "audibility"

and "visibility" apply directly in considering the handling and use of this

dynamic refugee potential.

As a working document for U.S. operational guidance, State

developed a definition of a political program for a free Cuba, with the

understanding that any real political program must be developed by the

Cubans themselves.

Psychological. Psychological activities for Operation Mongoose

make use of existing assignments of responsibilities within the U. S.

government: State, having the policy role, chairs an inter-agency. Cuba

any U.S. government information (VOA and Press Service) and generates

"gray" or non-official information (5 million cartoon books and thousands

of Spanish books on Cuba disseminated in Latin America); CIA passes

information appropriate for "gray" and covert psychological channels

(radio, mailings to Cuba, and dissemination inside Cuba).

Conditions and events in Cuba have provided many effective themes,

which have been promptly and sharply exploited by available means in the

Western Hemisphere. However, the U.S. still lacks the capability of

effectively getting information to the majority of the Cuban people.

short-wave broadcasts are highly regarded by the Cuban people, but short

wave receiver sets are limited inside Cuba. Our medium-wave broadcasts

compete against stronger Cuban signals; it was felt that greater U.S.

competition in medium-wave broadcasts could lead to Cuban interference

of U.S. commercial broadcasts over a fairly wide area of the U.S.

Clandestine broadcasts from a submarine (appearing as broadcasts by

Cuban guerrillas inside Cuba) have been mitiated; they are in their infancy,

and have a long way to develop before their messages are believed and

get passed among Cubans by_word-of-mouth. Dissemination of leaflets

and propaganda inside Cuba by balloon or aircraft has not received policy

approval.

Economic. State has the main responsibility for developing economic

actions. State has chaired an inter-agency working group, which generated
