Socialist. She said he told her he subscribes to "USSR"

and

"China Today"

She said that a member of the Internal Security

Sub-Committee who had a foreign sounding name (probably

A. L. TARABOCHIA,

an investigator for Senator JAMES 0. EASTLANI

of Mississippi) had contacted her concerning MOODY and

had informed her that a check had been made of the U. S.

Marine Corps and that that service was unaware of MOODY's

Socialistic sentiments.

Mrs. HOGAN advised she had no knowledge of MOODY's

involvement with Cuban exiles and regarded this possibility

as extremely remote since he is reportedly a paraplegic.

She said it is her understanding that his condition is

not a result of military service but rather a result of

"bends" developed while skin-diving.

She said he may

receive a partial disability pension from the Government

but does not believe he has any employment. She said his

wife's name is ALETA.

The files of the Miami Office contain no other

information relating to either REYNOLDS MOODY or any

COLONEL MOODY identifiable with Cuban activities in Miami.

Inquiries made of MM 492-S, MM 635-S, MM 639-S,

MM 873-S, MM 974-S, and PSI JOSE T. MEDINA, all of whom are

familiar with phases of both pro and anti-CASTRO activities

at Miami, resulted negatively in obtaining information

concerning any COLONEL MOODY.

D) No information is contained in the indices

of the Miami Office relative to the subject's wife, ALETA.

E) The identities of relatives of REYNOLDS MOODY

are not known to the Miami Division and consequently no

information is available concerning possible subversive

affiliations of relatives of MOODY.

F)

The present sympathies of REYNOLDS MOODY

are a matter of conjecture based on reports that he

writes liberal political views to Miami newspapers

and reportedly receives the magazines "USSR" and

"China Today"

It is anticipated that interview of

REYNOLDS MOODY would resolve whether or not he is

identical with the COLONEL MOODY, who has been reported

by IP 139-S as being involved in some type of operation

against CASTRO in May or June (1964). It is recalled

that TP 139-s had advised that at a picnic held on

Tampa Bay apter, ROBERT RAUER ada mentioned In tee

had mentioned In

general conversation that he had heard from a COLONEL Fla

MOODY in Miami and MOODY had informed him that there

would be some type of operation against CASTRO in May or

June.

again A in lay ore

On 7-30-64, the Tampa Office advised that

recontact with TP 139-S resulted in no additional

information which would identify MOODY or the operation

other than BRAUER had quoted. MOODY as naming the action

"Operation Condor".

TP 139-S advised that no one asked

BRAUER any questions concerning this matter, and BRAVER

did not elaborate.

TP 139-s said BRAUER gave the

impression that MOODY was a personal friend.

Tampa advised that COLONEL MOODY is not known

to Tampa indices or other Tampa sources.

In addition to resolving REYNOLDS MOODY's knowledge

of or involvement in the alleged operation against CASTRO,

it is anticipated that information will be

elicited concerning

any knowledge or association he might have with the Fair

Play for Cuba

â€¢ Committee and ROBERT BRAUER in particular.

With respect to any mention that will be made of

BRAUER, care will be exercised to protect

the identity of

TP 139-s.
