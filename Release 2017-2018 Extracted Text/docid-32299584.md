the land, and that his brother-in-law PETER MAGGIO had an

acquaintance who was interested in building a motel on the

land.

mortgage due January 15, at which time, 1f necessary, it would

be paid off by RUSSO and him, each putting up $30, 000.

not interested in options, and that if the land cannot be sold

at the present time, he can let it sit for five years.

check deposited in escrow with a title company and an agreement

to settle the sale within six months.

He said the only option

he would give would be a $10,000 cash payment for a six-month

option,

non-returnable if the option was not executed. BRUNO

pointed out that although he was handling the sales negotiations,

the land is actually in his wife's name and he was speaking

on her behalf.

LEVIN finally made a counter-proposition of a $1,000

deposit on October 2, 1962, pending the signing of an agreement

of sale on November 1, 1962, at which time he would make a

Garden State Vending Company

Camden, New Jersey

According to PH T-l and PH T-3, during October 1962,

BRUNO frequently discussed the possibility of selling Garden

State Vending Company in order to confine his interests to

the operation of Penn Jersey In Philadelphia.

PH T-T advised that on November 16, 1962, BRUNO

met with GEORGE HAMILTON to diseuss the possibillty of selling

Garden State to HAMILTON.

Negotiations were conducted over

a period of two weeks, with SALVATORE AVENA, & Camden attorney,

handling the legal details.

PH T-6 said that the agreement to sell Garden State:

to GEORGE HAMILTON had been completed on December 3, 1962,

and an agreement of sale had been signed. One of the reasons

which BRUNO gave T-6 for wishing to sell Garden State was that

too many people had a proprietary interest in 1t, mentioning

WILLIE RIPKA, who according to BRUNO drinks too much; JOE WILSON,

a Camden, N. J., accountant; and LOU CAMPBELL of Camden, N. Jo

On December 24, 1962, PH T-8 learned that BEN

GOLOB, who handled most of the

details of the operation of

Garden State Vending, brought ANGELO BRUNO a check drawn on

the Camden National Bank, payable to SUE BRUNO, In the amount

of $10,000.

This payment was part of the sale

of Garden

state Vending.

The $10,000 check was deposited in the Penn

Jersey vending company account, and at the same time a check

was drawn on the Penn Jersey account for $9,000, payable to

the Chemical National Bank and Trust Company of New York. It-

was expected that final settlement of the sale of Garden

State Vending would take place January 2, 1963, at the office

of attorney SALVATORE AVENA In Camden, N. J

On December 14, 1962, an Agent of the Newark Division

examined

the records of the Camden Credit Association regarding

the Garden State Vending Company. These records reflected

that the proprietors of the business were BENJAMIN H

Miscellaneous

PH. T-I said that on October 11, 1962, he was with

MARIO RICCOBENE when RICCOBENE consulted

ANGELO BRUNO about

the possibility of getting some extra business, and com-

plained that all the good business in numbers, horses, and

shylocking Is taken.

BRUNO disagreed,

saying

that there was

plenty of business

and that nobody would get run out of town,

as RICCOBENE claimed he would, unless they do not pay.

BRUNO told RICCOBENE that his

trouble is that he does not

know now to handle & business but ald agree that he would

think it over and

see what he could do for" SONNY".

T-1 said on October 30, 1962, BRUNO was visited

by three men identified by T-7 as FRANK MATTEO, aka FRANKIE

MENDEL; JOE SHERMAN; and AL INU, a Syrian friend of MATTEOS.

up some kind of gambling activity in the vicinity of

Reading, Pa.

On November 5, 1962, BRUNO was visited by IGNAZIO

DENARO and T-3, while DENARO discussed the operation of his

luncheonette.

BRUNO suggested that 1f DENARO had a card

game in the back room he could file a tax return at the end

of the year for any amount he wanted because the Government

would have no way of knowing how much he could make from

the card game..

BRUNO further suggested that on Saturday

nights DENARO close the luncheonette and stage a poker game

in the back room. It would not be necessary to advertise

because players would appear after hearing of it and there

would be no danger in case of a raid as long as no money

showed on the table.

On December 8, 1962,

T-2 reported that ANGELO

BRUNO discussed with

"Big TONY" (ANTHÖNY PERELIA of Vine-

land, N.J.) and BABE, not otherwise identified, activities
