INTRODUCTION.

In Reference E,

JMWAVE forwarded a review

of the nature of its relationship with

AMCARBON -2.

This review

indicates that the relationship with AMCARBON-2 evolved from that

action which was taken in September 1962 to insure that a security

breach would not occur as a result of an investigation which was

being carried out by the'Identity I relative to the fact that the

establishment of the Identity 2 was being kept from the

South Campus as a result of security restrictions which were in some

way related to JDUSK.

the relationship with AMCARBON-2

stemmed from the remedial action which had been taken in a crisis

situation

the establishment of a working relationship with the

Identity'' was an objective which

JMWAVE had always hoped to obtain.

As a matter of fact, in Reference A, the recommendation was made

that JMWAVE be given approvalto contact the major South Florida

media in an attempt to work out a relationship with these news

media which would insure that they did not turn the publicity

spotlight on those KUBARK activities in South Florida which might

come to their attention. • Thus

when a relationship was established

with AMCARBON-2, it was

carefully cultivated in order that MYAVE

might be able to use this contact at the Identity 3 as a means of

achieving the objective of having a relationship with the Identity

which would simultaneously insure the security of JMWAVE's operations,

and give JMWAVE an outlet into the press which could be used

surfacing certain select propaganda items. In the period October to

at which AMCARBON-2 introduced

As a result of this initial meeting on

12 December 1962g

an operational relationship has developed with

IMCARBON-1, and it is believed that this rolationship contributes

to the fulfillment of the over-all JMWAVE mission®

In view of

a special activities report is being submitted to cover the

nature of JMWAVE's relationship with

AMCARBON-1 during the

period December 1962 to March 1964.

FRAME OF REFERENCE FOR JMWAVE'S RELATIONSHIP WITH AMCARBON -1.

When AMCARBON-2 introduced AMCARBON-1 to RNUTEMAN,

AMCARBON -2

reviewed the ground rules under which he had been

cooperating

with REUTEMAN o

This review was conducted l'or AMCARBON-1's

benefit, in order that he might clearly understand the frame of

reference which should prevail in his relacionships with REUTEMAN.

In this review,

AMCARBON-2 pointed out thai it was the policy

of the Identity 3 that it would take no action which would

purposely, embarrass KUBARK or its South Florida operations.

As

in South

a resulterlorida did come

if any embarrassing items relative to KUBARK's operations

to the attention of the Identity 3, this

material would be brought to REUTEMAN's imnediate attention.

AMCARBON-2 made it clear to AMCARBON-l that such items should be

discussed with REUTEMAN in a frank manner.

In addition, AMCARBON-2

made the point that:

after in item was discussed, AMCARBON-1

should follow REUTENAN's guidance relative to how any particularly

embarrassing item might be handled by

the Identity 3,

so that it

at the same

AMCARBUN-2 pointed out that,

In additionly embarrassing item to REUTEMAY's attention and

if AMCARBON-1 brought

remedial action on the matter was not taked by REUTENAN within

a reasonable period of time!

the Identity 3 would feel free

to expose any ineptness on KUBARK's part.

AMCARBON-2 pointed

out that in return for this cooperation

from the Identity 3,

REUTEMAN had agreed that he would be available

for contact by

telephone or periodic personal meetings at which

AMCARBON -1

and ANCARBON-2 could discuss broad trends and developments in

Latin American affairs.

AMCARBON -2 advised AMCARBON-1 that this

arrangement did not mean that AMCARBON-1 could expect to obtain

any classified information from REUTEMAN.

The point was also

made that AMCARBON-L should not press for the obtaining of

classified information, but he should be alert to steering tips

which REUTEMAN might furnish him on fast-breaking news stories.

AMCARBON-1 indicated that he understood the frame of

reference

which had been

outlined by AMCARBON-2®

This frame of reference

as prevailed throughout JMWAVE's relationship with AMCARBON-1

during the period December 1962 to March 1964.

AMCARBON-I'S JOURNALISTIC CAREER.

AMCARBON-1 originally

started to work for

the Identity 3 in 195% on the City

and subsequently advanced from this assignment to

which entailed covering major political developments in

Florida.

At a later date, AMCARBON-1 became a feature writer for the

Indication of wanting

to be a

QDELF has been

questioned

about AMCARBON-1, and he has indicated that AMCARBON-1 is regarded

in the journilistic trade as an extremely likeable fellow who has

a keen mind but who lacks experience in

on Latin American

affairs.

It is QDELF's opinion that given

an appropriate lapse

of time, AMCARBON-1 will develop into one of the leading Latin

American specialists in U.S. journalistic circles.

AMCARBON -1

In view of this story,

AMCARBON-1 did locate

JMWAVE might

be able to discredit Carlos BANDIN Cruz (201-309611)

of the MRR splinter group as a result of BANDIN's overinflated

relative to his faction invading Cuba.

As a result

OPERATIONAL INTELLIGENCE.

In the period February

to February 1964,

AMCARBON-I has furnished JMWAVE with operational

intelligence as outlined below:

In WAVE 4836, dated 21 February 1963, AMCARBON-1

reported that AMBEND-1 was back in Miami and was

the object of

great deal of press interest in view of AMBEND-l's release from

a Havana prison.

AMCARBON-1 also indicated that AMBEND-1 would

probably be a knowledgeable source on the current activities of the

UR in Cuba.

This operational intelligence was most helpful

terms of keeping JMWAVE informed on AMBEND-l's

movements

Subsequent

developments revealed that AMCARBCN-1 could not contact AMBEND-1,

and thus AMBEND-l's return to

the United States

did not cause the

publicity stir that was initially anticipated.

In WAVE 6176,

dated 22 March 1963, AMCARBON-1

that the Identity 3 was

attempting to

feature article on the Bay of Pigs invasion.

This information enabled

JMWAVE to keep Headquarters informed on sensational-type articles

which might be appearing relative to Soviet missiles in Cuba.

d.. In WAVE 4701, dated 20 September 1963, AMCARBON-1

the discussions which he

AMBIDDY-l's public relations man.

This operational intelligence

was useful in terms of keeping KUBARK advised as to what AMBIDDY-I'S

representatives-were telling the outside world about their

operational activities.

In WAVE 6910, dated 31 October 1963, AMCARBON-1

indicating that Armando Andres GUIROLA Forte, who

REUTEMAN advised AMCARBON-1

that KUBARs had played no role in mounting a provocation operation

against the GOC.

At the same time

REUTEMAN pointed out that

1t was highly unlikely that GUIROLA was a GOC agent.

of this conversation, arrangements

were made for JMWAVE to check

out certain aspects of the GUIROL! story.

At the same time,

AMCARBON -1 was prevailed upon not to write a story which might

lead the public to speculate on wether GUIROLA was an agent or a

plant in a propaganda play designed to embarrass the GOC.

PIOPAGANDA OUTLET.

AMCA:BON-1 has been used successfully,

during the period covered by this report

as a propaganda outlet

through which items of interest to KUBARK

could be surfaced

the free world press.

Examples of how AMCARBON-1 has been harnessed

in this field are outlined below:

AMCRAB-1• The AMCRAß- detection story originally

surfaced ir the miami area on 13 October 1963 via the Diario de

las Americas, which played up an API release from Montevideo.

The API Mortevideo

story highlighled AMCRAB-I's information

relative tc GOC activities

in Uruguay

The story in the Diario

de las Americas had an extremely jimited impact on Spanish readers

in the Miani area.

As a result, it was decided to du a

of feature stories on AMCRAB-1 pointing up the fact

that AMCRAB-1

was typical of the veterans of

the: Granma expedition, who felt

they had been betrayed by CASTRO and had been relegated to positions

of obscurity once the revolution had put CASTRO in power.

AMCARBON -

was briefed in detail on the AMCR/B-1 story, and he vas

given an

opportunity to debrief AMCRAB-1 urder controlled conditions in a

JMWAVE safehouse.

After completirg his debriefing,

AMCARBON -1

wrote a series of feature articles

on ANCRAB-1.

The first article

in the series received front page headline play.

The series of

articles on AMCRAB-1

were well

written,

and they. provided an

excellent peg for JMWAVE to mount a replay operation

propaganda assets.

AMCARBON-1's story on AMCRAB-1 was picked up

by UPI, API and others, and it was played throughout Latin America.

The details of this surfacing can be found in WAVE

14 October 1963; WAVE 6092, dated 19 October 1963; and, WAVE 6174,

dated 21 October 1963.

Charles GRIFFIN

Shrimp Boat Story

On 26 February 1964,

INWAVE learned that when Mr. Charles GRIFFIN's sons went to Cuba

to reclaim the hijacked shrinp boat,

JOHNNY REB, they found that

select items were missing from the boat when it was

to them.

It was believed that this information would make a good

human interest story which JMWAVE assets could use to counter GOC

propaganda claims that United States officials had stolen items

from the Cusan fishing boats which had violated United States

In view of this opinion, a steering tip was
