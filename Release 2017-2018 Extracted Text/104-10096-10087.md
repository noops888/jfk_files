Chief, Latin America Division

SUBJECT:

SLHORIZON-1 Report Mentioning Cuban

Minister-Counsellor Statement on the

Assassination of President Kennedy

REFERENCE:

1A/C0/235-77 Dated 30 September 1977

1. The referent memorandum reported information from

a ZRWAHOO intelligence report of a statement made by the

Minister-Counsellor (MC) of the Cuban Embassy

in Kingston,

Jamaica, on 24 September 1977, that "Cuban exiles such as

DIAZ Lan (Enu) (sic) and others had been involved in the

assassination of President John F. Kennedy."

We believe

that this could refer either to Pedro DIAZ Lanz, or his

brother Marcos DIAZ Lanz, formerly Chief and Deputy Chief,

respectively,

of the Cuban Revolutionary Air Force.

Both

entered the U.S. from Cuba as exiles in mid-1959.

Since

that time the

DIAZ Lanz brothers reportedly have

been

closely associated with, and involved in numerous activities

with, Frank STURGIS (aka FIORINI) of Watergate fame.

The

Agency

assisted in the evacuation of Marcos, and Pedro

entered the U.S. on his own

Although both were debriefed

by the Agency, there is no indication that they were ever

considered Agency assets.

furtner.

that the MC said that "recent infor-

nation had arrived" implicating DIAZ Lan (fnu) (sic),

former air force officer, in the Kennedy assassination

but did not mention any other Cuban exiles by name or give

any further details.

Although the MC did not identify

the

source of his information,

the impression that the information might have been included

in a cable from the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

from the MC

without jeopardizing his security.
