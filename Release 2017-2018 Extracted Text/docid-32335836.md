AMERICAN UNDERGROUND

Also Known As Minutemen

Ft. Worth, Texas

The following information is supplemental to the

information furnished in letterhead memorandum of September 7,

1965.

The following formation was furnished on September 21,

1965, by Dallag T-1:

Dallas I-l advised that approximately 15 people had

attended two meetings of the American Underground during the

middle part of August, 1965, at the home of Delbert Ray in

Midlothian, Texas.

Dallas T-I stated that he had heard that

these meetings lasted approximately one to two hours and

involved discussions concerning how the U. S. Government was

infiltrated by members of the Communist Party or by individuals

who are sympathetic to the goals of the Communist Party.

Dallas I-I advised that at one of these meetings

approximately one hour was spent in target or practice shooting

with pistols by several members of the organization. Dallas T-1

stated that he was quite certain that Otto "Duke" Koling, and

Arthur Pollard attended both of the above meetings.

Dallas T-1

stated that he did not believe that

the group was attempting

to recruit any additional individuals to attend meetings of the

organization and he did not know of any plans formulated by the

group.

Dallas T-1 advised on October 25, 1965, that activities

have been very quiet within the organization and as fär as he knew,

no meetings have occurred since the middle of August.
