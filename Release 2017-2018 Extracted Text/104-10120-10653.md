SECURITY INDOCTRINATION

AND

SECRECY OATH

I have been informed officially that the United States

Government is engaged in major technical programs to

collect intelligence. These programs are concerned with

overhead reconnaissance of denied areas using aircraft and

space vehicles and with the collection of intelligence based

on interception and decoding of foreign ciphers.

These programs are of vital importance to the

national security, and any disclosures of these activities will

endanger the intelligence sources. Official confirmation of

such activities, under other than very carefully controlled

circumstances, is precluded by present national policy,

despite any level of public speculation.

The Director of Central Intelligence, charged by

statute with the protection of intelligence sources and methods,

has prescribed security policies of compartmented controls

called:

for protection of research,

devela

-perations of overhead

reconnaissance equipment.

TALENT/KEYHOLE, for protection

of photographic product, identified by the

codeword

and for the protection of

intelligence rom electrical signals collected. •

by satellites, identified by the codeword

Communications Intelligence (COMINT),

for the protection of intelligence obtained by

interception and decoding of foreign ciphers,

iden

stied by the codeword!
