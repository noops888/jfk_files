SAC, DALLAS (134-1A-875A

SA EDWIN D. KUYKENDALL

DL-6-S

1/8/65

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

BATE 55-419SY5T48 SLO/SR

DL6-S on 12/16/64 furnished to SA EDWIN D.

KUYKENDALL a handwritten report dated 12/14/64. It is.

filed as 134-1A-875.

Informant advised ALBERT OROZCO, GI Forum

member, Dallas, called JOE LANDIN

Dallas, to invite

him to a GI Forum meeting.

In their conversation,

OROZCO told LANDIN he was planning to talk to the

Chief of Police, Dallas, to clear the GI Forum's name.

The Dallas COP had on television indicated that the GI

Forum and PASO were subversive organizations.

This happened

shortly after President KENNEDY's assassination.

Off and

on OROZCO meets potential Forum members who decline to

join that organization because of the above mentioned

bad publicity.

Informant

stated JoE MOLINA, a past member of

Gi Forum, was questioned by the Dallas PD on the night

President KENNEDY was killed.

MOLINA was described as a

subversive, by tle Dallas Times

Herald Television station,

and MOLINA

has sued the newspaper.

OROZCO told LANDIN

FORUM's high officials. had not come to MOLINA's aid.

OROZCO had spoken to BILL LOWERY and had been told that

LOWERY had not given MOLINA's name to the FBI. OROZCO

said this apparently was true.

Since the FBI has told

MOLINA that they had not given MOLINA's name to the police,

it was not known where the police obtained MOLINA's name.

OROZCO recalled that President KENNEDY was a great friend

of the GI Forum.

Informant had no additional information.
