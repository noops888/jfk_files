it 2101 Middle River Dr. Ft. Lauderdale, the money is usually there, ready for her to make the deposite. The secretary,

known only as Dee, counts the money out, makes out the deposit slips, and then brings it to the bank. CI also advised

that Burnstine keeps a ledger locked in his desk and that it contains records of all his transactions.

CI further stated that Burnstine recently purchased a boat by the name of Najah II which is presently tied

up at the Bahla Mar Dock BaBin. CI advised that there 1s' a connection between Oscar Crouch and Burnstine. CI stated that

Records show that Mr. Bell was the pilot of the Jet Aircraft 980K that flew to Montego Bay in September of 1972

to pick up Richard Silkey after the plane crash. Upon meeting with Mr. Bell and properly Identifying ourselves,

Mr. Bell refused to answer any questions of give & statement. Mr. Bell was advised that we were investigating a

felonious crime and he could possibly be himself involved should he withhold information from law Enforcement..

He gave the attitude that he just didn't give a damn. He further stated that he would not give any statement without

a subpoens and only to testify before the Grand Jury, however he would not advise us as to what he could testify to.

Mr. Bell, who maintained a very arrogant hostile attitude during this intervdew, was advised that we were Investigating

& felonious crime and that he could make himsell part of the crime by withholding information from the Police and

hampering this investigation. This did not bother him at all.. He further stated to the undersigned he would not

answer any questions as we did not advise him of his rights per Miranda. He was advised that he was not a subject

of this Investigation, only as a witness and not as a defendent.

Due to Mr. Bell's attitude, it is felt by the undersigned that its he 1s withholding inormation and had

full knowledge of what he was doing when he flew Silkey back from the Islands. When this was brought to his

attention, he stated that he just flew a guy back who was Involved in an automobile accident, nothing more.

POLICE INFORMATION

DETAILS:

This date at 2:45 PM (Monday, 4 November 1974) I had telephonic contact with Special Agent lordant of DEA

d

In Mant. Dordant advised me that he was contemplating a Grand Jury Inquiry on November I4th, 1974 1n regards to

322

the cocaine transaction wherein Mr. Burnstine was Involved with undercover agents of DEA.

I questioned Dordant as to the status of the marijuana Investigation which Det. Olivieri and Agent Tom

644

Pfeiffer of FDLE have been conducting for some time. Dordant advised me that there would most likely be no proceedings

In regards to our case unt1l 1975. His reasoning for this was to the effect that the investigation was still not

complete; that their authority would attempt to flip Mr. Kline, a co-defendent with Burnstine In the cocaine

Pa

misadventure.

Dordant advised me that all of the files pertinent to the Marijuana case are available to us and that there

95

were no objections to us proceeding on a State Grand Jury level.

date and Interviewed Lee Reed. We met with Reed In Highland County Sheriff's Department Jail at approximately

The purpose of this interview was to ascertain from Reed whether he would want to cooperate with the government

by testifying against other members of the Burnstine organization. It was made clear to Reed that no promises

could be made to him in reference to his pending Federal charges, however, we would discuss with the Federal

Prosecutor the possibility of Reed being an undictable co-conspirator in the case.

Reed stated that he would

have to think some about testifying against Burnstine as he felt he would not live long if he did that. If he

does testify or give any information it will be in reference to Nick Metropolis, Paul Kersten, Billy Klein,

Billy Martin, Rick Silkey, James King and a lew others unnamed. Reed advises. that he would have to constult

with his wife and his attorney before he makes a decision on this matter. He advised that his attorney is

Max Kogan. Rogan also represents Kenneth Burnstine, therefore, it is strongly felt by the undersigned that

Kogan would not recommend Reed to cooperate. Reed advises he would contact the undersigned on this matter

on March 26, 1975 after he met with his lawyer. Agent Warner of DEA was advised of this meeting.

Añother deal was set up and Metraupolls flew commercial to Jamaica and met Capt. Montagu and Gordon. B/M's Nick and Billy

Had paid for the entire load. Silkey flew N-11FN to Vernam where he was met by Metraupolis.

and Billy, Metraupolis was released and flew back to Ft. Laud, by commercial alriire. This was the first of three loads that

Silkey was contracted to fly for a total sum of $90,000. Martin handled the picking up of the marij. and Werking acted as

head mule. The other mule was Murphy. After the marij, was unloaded, Silkey flew the aircraft to Pahokee, FL., refueled the

plane and cleaned it out and brought the plane back to Ft. Laud. International. Martin and the mules took the marij. to a

warehouse where it was weighed and divided into halves. One half was stored in a warehouse in an old truck body and the other

half was placed back into the camper which was owned by Nick and Billy and later driven to Miami by Werking. The warehouse

was. located at 1361-B S.W. 20 Terrace, Fort Lauderdale. Generally, a couple of days later, Metraupolis would send a mule or

go himself to pick up the camper from Miami and bring it back to the warehouse to be stored until the next deal.

Martin came up with a source of distribution out of Ohio - a State Senator whose name Burnstine could not recall and a man

named San from Columbus.. Burnstine stated it was a point of Interest that Sam's mules were arrested in Deland, FL. in 1973 wi

pperating. BURNSTINE stated he could also remember GEORGE NAGEL and JIMMY STADLER being at the party.

"BURNSTINE stated that in Jan. 1973 he approached KEATS with a proposal to build a secluded airstrip on KEATS' ranch. The deal

Evas that a 5,000' airstrip would be built on the ranch with private access and a storage barn and, perhaps later, fuel capabil:

ty. They.

were to set up a Bahamian Corp. and make the whole think look like a game bird farm. KEATS prepared a lease. The

Bahamian corp was founded thus GAME BIRD BREEDERS INTERN'TI, LTD came Into being.' KEATS was given. $2,000 for the cost of bull.

dozing the strip and subsequently another $2,000 to $3,000 to go against building the strip.

In the agreement KEATS was to

receive $5,000/month or $10/pound, whichever was greater, against any loads of grass flown in on the property. KEATS was also:

to build a fence and put in bird houses to make it look like a legit game bird farm. METRAUPOLIS & MARTIN were in on the deal

In Dec. 1973 a meeting was held at BURNSTINE's house.. In attendance were BURNSTINE; METRAUPOLIS, MARTIN, DEPAULIS & WERKING.

Purpose was to discuss a new deal. BURNSTINE wished to retire and turn the operation over

to the 4 mentioned subjects. He

agreed he would supply planes for them to use and be paid 15% of the net money based on $100/pound. If he himself flew any

trips he would be paid $50,000 per trip plus the 15%.: Basically, BURNSTINE's agreement with them was merely contracting his

services as leasor of the aircraft.
