GUS

ALEX,

Reurtel 5/3/61.

The information reported by CG 6443-C indicating

huge gambling operations carried on in factories and business

places opens an avenue which may lead to interesting and signifi-

cant information as to hoodlum gambling operations.

With this

in mind, you should exert every effort to develop

further informa-

tion concorning bookmaking at factories and other business places

in order that a comprohensive picture of such activities may be

developed.

You should attenpt to establish the connection between

the individuals who actually operate these books and their

intermediaries who maintain llaison with and carry out the orders

of the top-ranking Hoodlum figures who dominate this racket.

This matter should be given immediate and vigorous

attention, and the Bureau should be kept closely advised of

pertinent developments.
