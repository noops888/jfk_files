Although HERRERO and CARBONELL Were in frequent con

tact during 1963 and HERRERO had visited CARBONELL's residence

on one or two occasions, he knew little or nothing about

CARBONELL's personal life of his associates. CARBONELL WaS

considered to be a "loner" and was somewhat secretive about

his movements, usually coming and going without warning.

Culia.

other the Dues riendship with PRUDENCIO\DUENAS ElaR 2A

never noted that CARBONELL had made any particular effort

to try to develop specific information concerning the activities

or plans of the anti-CASTRO activists in Miami.

CARBONELL was generally considered to be a reputable

individual and HERRERO had never noticed anything that would

suggest that CARBONELL was involved in subversive activities

against the United States or in behalf of the Cuban Govern-

ment.

In retrospect, HERRERO realized that CARBONELL had

apparently used his contacts with HERRERO and his colleagues

to obtain information about their activities.

HERRERO stated he had not seen or heard from CAR-

BONELL since the Summer of 1964 when HERRERO had visited

Miami from Puerto Rico.

It was about that time that HERRERO

had contacted CARBONELL's residence and learned that he was

in New York City.

HERRERO stated that he is a permanent resident of

the United States

and considers this to be his second country.

He indicated that if he ever obtained any additional infor-

mation concerning CARBONELL or his activities, he would

immediately contact United States Government authorities.
