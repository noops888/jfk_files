DE 92-216

On October 22, 1962, DE T-2 advised

that ANGELO

MARINO, prominent member of the Italian crininal element

in San Jose, California, had been in touch with

GENE BUFALINO on October 19, 1962, and had been instructed

to make the necessary arrangements to get a job for

SAL COSTANZA, Martinez, California, a close associate

•i MARINO, as a union organizer in

the new General Motors

Plant being built in Fremont, California. According to

Informant, MARIND described

BUFALINO as a union man

from the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, area who had

been associated with ANGELO BRUNO in that area.

According to Informant, MARINO described BUFALINO as a

brother of the right hand council man to JAMES HOFFA.

and

further described BUFALINO's brother as a "friend",

meaning a member of the "organization". Informant

related

that he got the impression that MARINO vas under

orders to do something about obtaining an organizing job

for SAL COSTANZA and

that MARINO had been designated

to handle all union matters of this nature for the San Jose

"family".

According to Informant, MARIND remarked that he

had been in the east recently and

in contact.

with ANGELO BRUNO in Philadelphia, a cousin of MARINO.

He further described BRUNO as a big shot and as a member

of the national commission of the "organization".

On April 16, 1962, DE T-3 advised that GENE BUFALINO

was at a dinner party at an attorney's house in San francisco

on March 26, 1962.

Informant advised that BUFALINO was

then

civorced and resided in Los Angeles where he is

employed as head of the Distillers, wine and sugar workers.

According to Informant, BUrALINO is the brother of the

BUFALINO who is the chiet attorney. for JIMMY HOFFA,

National President of the Teamsters Union in Detroit.

GENE BUFALINO during the course of dinner conversation

mentioned that he is very close to his brother,

serves as HOFFA's attorney and explained that his brother had

recently received a $10,000.00 settlement from "Time" Magazine

because of an article defaming his character, which alleged

that the brother had been an

attorney for criminal types

and hoodlums such as HOFFA.

Informant advised that GENS BUFALINO

noted that he and his brother frequently discussed matters

relating to HOFFA, in addition to purely legal matters.

•It is the Informant's opinion that GENE BUFALINO has considerable

information concerning HOFFA and his crowd. Informant advised

that GENE BUFALINO appeared willing to further their

acquaintance and indicated that he might move to San Francisco

during June, 1962:

DE T-3 on July 1l, 1962, advised that no further

contact or information had been

obtained with GENE BUFALINO

and that BUFALINO had not moved to San Francisco in June,

1962, as planned. Informant advised on that occasion that no

further information regarding BUFALINO's activities was then

available.

In 1961, DE T-4 reported that the Wine Distillery

and Rectifying

Workers Union

was formed by. WILLIAM BUFALINO

of Detroit, Michigan, and that his brother, GENE, is presedent

of the union, with offices at 9015 Wilshire Boulevard,

Beverly Hills, California.

This source also reported that the

office space at that address is apparently used only as a

telephone service and no business activities are conducted there.

In late August, 1961, DE I-4 reported that the

Wine Distillery and Rectifying Workers Union of which GENE BUFALINO

is president, was formed solely for the purpose of furnishing

members of the Italian mob with legitimate employment,
