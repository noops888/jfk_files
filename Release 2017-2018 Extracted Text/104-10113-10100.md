I. Subject was born in Paris on 29 November 1919, the ille-

gitimate son of Lucien Xavier CONEIN, born March Ilth 1872 at Meaux,

and Estelle Leontine Aimee ELIN, born June 6th 1893 at Soengi, Sumatra.

The birth was registered at the Mairie of the lith Arrondissement under

the name of ELIN, although subject was later recognized by his father

and took the name of CONEIN.

CONEIN Sr. died at Redon (Ille-et-Vilaine)

on February Ist 1924.

2. CONEIN went to the United States in 1925 and was brought up

by his maternal aunt, Mrs. Jeanne licBEE, presently living at 1013 Wiscon-

sin Street, San Francisco, California.

The latter has been in the United

States since 1921 and became a naturalized citizen on 19 June 1942.

CONEIN became a naturalized citizen on August 11th 1942 at Tacoma, Washing-

ton. His mother is presently applying at this Embassy for an immigration

visa on the Netherlands quota, in conformity with the Innigration Act of

1924 which states that nationality for quota purposes shall be determined

by the place of birth. Her sponsors for entry into the United States are

her sister and her son, both of whom have filed affidavits at the embassy.

CONEIN also has a younger brother presently living with his mother at 15

rue du Chalet, Malakoff, Seine. The latter is married and is attempting

to get a divorce.

According to the affidavit submitted by CONEIN in his mother's

favor, he was first married on 29 July 1943 and divorced on 9 November of

the same year. No further details concerning this marriage are stated..

He was remarried in Paris on April 2nd 1946 at the Mairie of the Ist Arr-

ondissement to Monique Denise Pierre VEBER, born January 20th 1919 at Nice,

the daughter of Serge Pierre VEBER, well-known theatrical producer, and

. Jeanne Henriette ALCAN. They are both French citizens. Im children were

born of this marriage. According to CONEIN's sworn statement he was r

Vorced in Paris on 23" December 1947. The records of the Tribunal Civil of

the Seine Department indicate that a decree of divorce "in absentia" was

granted on that date at the request of Monique Denise VEBER in the absence

of CONDIN®

According to French law this decree is not considered valid

until officially notified to CONEIN personally, at which time the perti-

nent data will be entered in the marriage register of the Ist Arrondisse

ment where they were married. This has not yet been done and CONEIN is

therefore not yet considered legally divorced according to. French law.

Certain discrepancies exist in the matter of the exact date of

CONEIN's second marriage.

Official French records give the date of mar-

riage as April 2nd 1946, which is presunably the correct one. According

to CONEIN's file in the Passport Section of the Embassy he was married

in Paris on May 13th 1946?2Wrpw)L2y of March 4th 1948, on the other hand,

states that he was married April 23rd 1946 in Paris. It is possible that

these discrepancies are the result of a clerical error somewhere along the

line, or that one indicates the date of the civil ceremony and one the

religious ceremony, which is usual in France though rarely so far apart.

5. During the course of her routine interview at the Embassy in

marital situation, although she had heard that he had recently been di-

vorced.

No valid reason for this reticence is known, particularly since

investigation revealed that she was a frequent visitor to her son and

daughter-in-law at 171 rue Saint Honore. This information is therefore

submitted for the record and whatever it might be worth.

Serge Pierre VEBER, CONLIN's father-in-law, was born in Paris

on September 2nd 1897. He was married in Paris on April 18th 1918 to

Jeanne Henriette Denise ALCAN, born July 3rd 1896 at Ville d'Avray (S-et-0).

Lonique Denise CONEIN, nee VEBER, born January 20th 1919 at Nice, is

their only child. VEBER is a well-known dramatic writer and producer.

In 1939 the VEBER family lived at 15 Qual de Conti, Paris. VEBER left

that address in 194l and is believed to have joined his family in Algiers.

In 1943 the family was investigated in order to determine whether or not

they were Jews.

It was eventually determined that although they had

Jewish connections they were to be classified as Aryans. Serge Pierre VEBER

has a brother, Gilles Pierre, born February 17th 1896 in Paris. He is

divorced from

one Raymonde KIATEMACKERA and was remarried in Paris on 25

May 1935 to Catherine AGADJANIANIZ, born 25 Notember 1911 in Petrograd.

The latter, who is of Russian origin but a French national, had herself

been divorced from one Jean ROSSIGNOL.

1943 were living at 74 rue Erlanger, Paris 16e. Gilles Pierre VEBER is

a writer who has published numerous novels and for twenty years he was an

associate editor of "Le Matin". No derogatory information concerning the

VEBER family was revealed during the course of the investigation.
