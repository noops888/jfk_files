INTERNAL SECURITY - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC GEK)

On June 9, 1965, MM T-1, another government agency

which conducts intelligence type investigations, advised

that the following information was received from a Cuban

refugee associated with activists in the Miami area.

A commando force of 49 Cuban exiles and I1 Amer-

icans is being formed in Miami by ODELIO-CARCIA/DERIZANZO. F/

and GERALD PATRICK HEMMING, It is being supported by an

unidentified person believed to reside outside of the

Miami area.

The commando team is to be used by Dominican

General ANTONIO IMBERY BERRERAS, head of the Loyalist

Forces in the Dominican Republic (DR). Presumably this

commando group will try to overthrow rebel forces in the

DR.

On June 8, 1965, GARCIA and ATON CONSTANZO PALAU

met with GERALD PATRICK HEMMING who said that 10 of his

followers, all American citizens, were ready to join the

49 Cuban exiles in the Dominican operation's, u
