On November 10, 1960 SJ I-1, an individual who

claims wide acquaintance

among Dominican aliens and political

exiles in Puerto Rico, advised he recently learned about the

presence in Puerto Rico of captioned subject, who is believed

by anti-TRUJILLO Dominicans to be engaged in

activities on

behalf of the TRUJILLO Government. SJ T-l stated this suspicion

is based upon information indicating that subject was previously

working for the Dominican Government.

The December 10, 1960 edition of "The San Juan Star",

an English language newspaper published in San Juan, Puerto

Rico, contained an article entitled,

"Priest in Dominican

Republic-Cuban Plot Here.

This article indicates that Father

RICARDO VELASCO was a self-described intermediary in a 1959

TRUJILLO plot to topple FIDEL CASTRO, who acted between the

Dominicans and American-born Major WILLIAM MORGAN In Cuba.

This article quotes VELASCO as stating he flew to Cuba on

several occasions aboard Dominican planes and credits MORGAN

with tipping him off that the scheme had been betrayed.

VELASCO also indicated he later became a chaplain in the

Dominican Foreign Legion, which he described as a band of

mercenaries who were given the task in the Dominican Republic

of eliminating an invasion force that had landed at Constanza

In the summer of 1959.

On December 17, 1960 SJ T-2 furnished the following

information regarding captioned subject:

He first heard of Father VELAZCO in the Dominican

Republic in August, 1959, at which time JOHN ABBES

GARCIA, Chief

of the Dominican "Servicio

de Inteligencia Militar" (MIlitary

Intelligence Service) (SIM), had negotiated a deal with WILLIAM

MORGAN, the former American paratrooper who fought for the

forces

of FIDEL CASTRO in Cuba against FULGENCIO BATISTA,

former President of Cuba. ABBES GARCIA was at that time

preparing a flight into Cuba with a plane-load of ten Cubans

to join forces with MORGAN in a plot against CASTRO. Father

VELAZCO was apparently supposed to accompany the flight, but

did not do so inasmuch as he was apparently too drunk to

the trip.

, about September, 1959 SJ T-2 received Information

from CARLOS VGACEL, a SIM Agent, that Father VELAZCO was the
