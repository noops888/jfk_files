in carrying out the stated objectives

of the organization,

thereby posing a threat to the

life of the President and

other public officials.

by the Chicago Division that the activities of Minutemen

and/or itse members are in violation of any Federal statutes

over: which the Bureau has investigative jurisdiction.

Consideration has been given to every source

concealed
