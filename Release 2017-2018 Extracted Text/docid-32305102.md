Said

On 6/18/64, USA JUSTIN J MAHONEY, NDNY, advised

that JOHN T. MULLEN, Chief of Intelligence Division, Treasury

Department, IRS, Albany, NY, had contacted him and

made

available to him a letter dated 6/17/64 from JOHN A. ROCHE,

Deputy Superintendent, NYSP, Albany, which stated as follows:

"Information has been received from a reliable

and confidential source that a clandestine meeting was

held in the City of Albany on June 14, 1964, which

was

attended by several known criminal figures.

The

purpose of this meeting was to arrange for the murder

of an informant used by you during the recent gambling

investigation in the City of Albany. The informant

is described as a real estate operator.

"Inasmuch as this Division is not familiar with

the details of your recent raid, it is not possible

for us to evaluate the authenticity of this informa-

tion. Should this information be of value to you,

For information of Bureau, EDWARD PERRONE,

referred

to above, is believed to be AL 3088-C-TE, a Top Echedon Criminal

Informant of the Albany Office (Albany file 137-532) (Bureau

to obe At.

file 13710497) • DOC FARONE is believed to be identical to

AL 2990-C, a Criminal Informant of the Albany Office (Albany

file 137-667, Bureau file 137-2231).

Lt. Supervisor ROBERT CRYAN; NYSP Headquarters, Albany,

was immediately contacted and he furnished substantially the

same information as set forth above but indicated that JOE

MOSHER', according to the NYSP informant, had been given the

contract to. kill the above referred-to IRS informant within two

weeks. CRYAN said that

the NYSP did not know the identity of

MOSHER and that the name MOSHER is phonetic. He further stated

that their information was secured from a live informant who

was supposedly present at the meeting.

This informant's

information was relayed to NYSP Headquarters from a BCI man

in the Troop "C" area (it is noted that Troop "C" covers

Binghamton, NY)• CRYAN further advised that the IRS informant

who is to be "knocked off" is supposed to be a real estate

operator at Albany.

He said the State Police have no idea

who this individual might be. CRYAN was requested to have

the NYSP informant recontacted to secure additional details

from the informant in order that informant's information

could be evaluated. He said he would have this done.

In the absence of MULLEN, Special Agent WILLIAM

HARINETI, Intelligence Division, IRS, Albany, was immediately

contacted

and he stated

that the IRS had

no informant who

furnished information concerning gambling in Albany. He said

that all their information was secured by undercover IRS Agents.

He stated that one of their undercover Agents used the fictitious

name of BILL SEAMAN and that upon receipt of information from

the NYSP a check of the Albany Telephone Directories reflected

that there is a Seaman Real Estate Agency in Albany which is

operated by a MAURICE SEAMAN.

On 6/19/64, AL 3088-C-TE was contacted under cover

of a routine contact. It should be noted that at no time during

this contact with him was any mention made to him of the

information heretofore set forth concerning the alleged meeting

of 6/14/64. During this contact with him, as on every contact

with him, he was

asked if FALCONE, MANCUSO, or SAM GRIO had

been in contact with him or if he had seen

them.

He stated

that they have not been in contact with him and he had not

seen them

for at least two months. At this time, informant was

queried about any gambling interests that FALCONE, MANCUSO, and

GRIO might have in the Saratoga Springs, NY, area. He stated

that back in the 1940's, when he was operating the Brook Club

in Saratoga, MANCUSO, FALCONE, and several others whom informant

could not recall had attempted to "muscle in" on DOC FARONE's

gambling interests in Saratoga Springs and had been literally

thrown out of Saratoga by FARONE.

Informant further volunteered

that FARONE detests MANCUSO and probably would have nothing

to do with MANCUSO so therefore would not become involved with

him in gambling. It should be noted that informant advised

that DOC FARONE was a very good friend of his, stating that

FARONE backed him financially when informant operated a

restaurant and bar equipment supply business in Albany, NY.

During the contact with informant, he was also asked

what the feeling around town was as a result of the IRS gambling

raids. He said that it was common knowledge around Albany

that an elderly man driving an old car was believed responsible

art ang

by local gamblers for furnishing information to IRS that led

to their arrest. He said that he had learned this from JOSEPH

MOSHER, an employee at the State Campus Site, who resides at

35 Holmes Court and employed by the Basic Construction Co. as

a truck driver, that

"SCOTCHY" MORRISON was the source of

'this

information and it was indicated by MORRISON that the local

gamblers are out to "rough up" this elderly man. He knows

nothing about this elderly man and could furnish no information

concerning his identity. The above information was volunteered

and at no time had Agents mentioned MOSHER's name nor the

alleged meeting in Albany. In addition, informant advised that

MOSHER is the son of the widow of Colonel WILLIAM MULL, who

formerly was a finance officer with the New York National

Guard or some other military. organization. CI also advised

that MOSHER's mother is presently a patient at Albany Hospital

for the Incurables and this was arranged for and is being paid

for by DANIEL O'CONNELL, the Democratic Chairman of Albany

County. He also mentioned that MOSHER is married and has

three children and was supposed to have been arrested in

New York City but has no local arrests.

On 6/22/64, AL 3088-C-TE telephonically contacted

SA EDWARD M. NALLY,

IR. on his weekly telephonic contact with

SA NALLY (it should be noted that this iformant contacts SA NALLY

every Monday in order that arrangements can be perfected to

meet him later on in the day if a meeting with him is desired)

and advised that he had been in error when he had stated that

an elderly man driving an old car was believed to be responsible

by local gamblers for having furnished information to IRS that

led to their arrest. He stated that he had meant to say that

it was a young man driving an old car rather than an elderly

man driving an old car.

On 6/22/64, AL 2990-C was contacted, at which time

he advised that he did not know ROSARIO MANCUSO and had never

met MANCUSO. He further advised he did not know and had never

met JOSEPH FALCONE. He admitted knowing SALVATORE FALCONE

(brother of JOSEPH FALCONE), advising the last time he saw

SALVATORE FALCONE was 16 or 17 years ago when SALVATORE FALCONE

wanted him to intercede with the police authorities relative

to getting a friend of SALVATORE FALCONE permission to open

up a gambling spot in Saratoga Springs, NY. Informant stated

that on this occasion he approached the then Chief of Police

PATTY ROX (now deceased) concerning this and was flatly turned

down by. ROX. It should be noted that this contact with the

informant was a routine contact and no mention was made to the

informant of the alleged meeting of 6/14/64. However, it

should be noted that this informant had previously been contacted

by SA ROBERT W. MC DONOUCH on 6/11/64, at which time informant

was recuperating from a severe hemorrhoidectomy.

On the

occasion of this meeting the informant was suffering severe

pain and was incapacitated to some extent.

On 6/22/64, Agent WILLIAM HARINETT, Intelligence

Unit, IRS, was recontacted and advised of information

developed by AL 3088-C-TE to the effect. that Albany gamblers

were made aware of an IRS informant's identity in connection

with the recent gambling raids by WILLIAM "SCOTCHY"' MORRISON,

Albany' gambler arrested at these raids, and the source of this

information for the informant was one JOSEPH MOSHER. It was

pointed out that the informant

was supposed to be a young man

driving an older car.

HARTNETT then advised that IRS had used a relatively

new and young IRS. Agent as an undercover man whose activities

had placed him in contact with MORRISON, several other gamblers,

and with JOSEPH MOSHER. HARINETT said the IRS Agent had used

the alias of BILL SEAMAN and became acquainted with MOSHER as

a fellow bettor. HARTNETT advised that SEAMAN had utilized an

old car, participated in the raids, was observed by several

of the arrested gamblers at IRS Headquarters, during booking

and arraignment procedures, and could very possibly have been

recognized as the undercover agent

at this time.

On 6/22/64, Chief of Police JOHN TUFFEY, Albany, NY,

advised that he was furnished information heretofore set forth

•by JOHN MULLEN.

He-stated that if the NYSP had no objection,

he would interview JOSEPH MOSHER and EDWARD PERRONE. He stated

that he would be in communication with the NYSP concerning this.

He advised that the information referred to heretofore did not

make sense, stating that JOSEPH MOSHER has been known to him

for years as a long-time resident of the Greater Albany, NY,

area, except for a brief period of time when he resided in

New York City. He described MOSHER as a "punk," stating that
