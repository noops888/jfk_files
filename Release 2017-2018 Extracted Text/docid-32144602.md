CG 6498-PC was contacted by SA WILLIAM E. ROEMER, on

11/25/63, but at that time had no personal knowleäge of RUbY.

On

11/26/63, CG 6498-PC advised that he had solicited information from

politicians of the 24th Ward, the former voting residence of RUBY.

PC advised that he talked to

two persons who appeared to know RUBY

tie freene

"rom many years ago.

They advised that RUBY was never anything but

"a punk" and never had any hoodlur connections or associations. One

person advised that he recalls that RUBY attempted to sneak into a

prize fight in Chicago, believed to be the second DEMPSEY - TUNNEY

fight, and was caught by a police officer who beat him over the head

with his night stick.

As a result of this beating, RUBy now has a

plate in his head.

Apparently this

causes pressure when RUBY becomes

excited and causes RUBY to act emotionally.
