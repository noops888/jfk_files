period 1980 through 1993; a subject search on JFK

assassination (Kennedy assassination, etc.), same

period; all appropriate components be asked to forward

any documents related to the assassination that

were not provided earlier.

DA & DS&T: All appropriate components be asked to

forward to us any documents related to the

assassination that were not provided earlier: a file

search when an obvious need is recognized.

2. Information responsive

to this request should be

forwarded to the Historical Review Group,
