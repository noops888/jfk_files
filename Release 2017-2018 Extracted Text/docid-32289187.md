BU 92-61

On 6/4/63, Corporal CAL BEACOCK, National Criminal

Intelligence Unit, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, advised

that the names of WALLACE and GEORGETTE GROSS are unfamiliar

He suggested that the information relating to WALLACE

GROSS (PH) could refer to a Toronto lawyer known as "WALLY"

ROSE who has defended leading Toronto racketeers in the past

and has had considerable contacts with them.

Corporal BEACOCK

added that it is only logical that

"WALLY" ROSE is acquainted

with and has had dealings with CHESLER.

He also said that

ROSE has a number of girl friends, one of which may well be

known as GEORGETTE. He pointed out he has received informa-

tion recently to the effect that WALLY ROSE visited the

Bahama Islands, reportedly for the purpose of obtaining an

interest in gambling casinos in the Islands.

Based upon information furnished by BU 82-0* at

Buffalo and PH 591-C*, STEVE MAGADDINO of Niagara Falds,

New

York, and ANGELO BRUNO have been approached about financing

part of the cost of construction and operation of the proposed

gambling casino.

Members of the

"Magaddino family" have

discussed the details of this gambling venture with JACK E.

CELLMAN, an attorney in Niagara Falls, New York, particularly

about obtaining mortgages, interest payments and the market

value of stock of Consolidated Bowling Corporation.

As previously reported, CHESLER and GELLMAN are

large stockholders and the original promoters of Consolidated

Bowling Corporation.

It is also noted that PASQUALE NATARELLI, a leading

figure in the Treasury Balance lotteries in Western New York

explained to subject's son-in-law, VINCENT A. SCRO, that the

employment restructions of the Exemption Certificate did not

eure on on the

prohibit them from placing pit borses or supervisors of their

own choosing in the gambling casino.

According to highly placed informants, sAMUEL Go

RANGATORE, JR. went to Philadelphia to discuss this gambling

venture with ANGELO BRUNO on 5/26/63.

While in Philadelphia,

RANGATORE met with BRUNO, FELIX JOHN DE TULLIO, NICK PICCOLO

and ALFREDO (LNU) at Lyndy's Luncheonette. After RANGATORE
