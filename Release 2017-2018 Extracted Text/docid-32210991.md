"A secret and reliable source of I-l reported

that he had attonded the lighth Congress of the Interna-

tional Association of Denocratic Lawyers' (IADL) which was'.

held in Budapest from March 31 to April 6, 1964. The

Continental press carried a story to the effect that he

explained his views on the Kennedy assassigation and asked

the INDL to form an international committeeiof noted lawyers

to discover the real circunstances under which the Kennedy

assassination occurred.

LANE returned to England on June 9, 1964, arriving

at London Airport Irom Copenhagen, Denmark.

He was ac-

companied by his flancee, Miss ANNE-LISE DABELSTEEN, a

designer, born May 15, 1941, traveling on a Danish pass-

port No: 2301698. Shortly after his arrival he attended

a press conference at the Airport which had been arranged

by JAMES DELANDY GARST and at which LANE again expressed

his views on the Kennedy assassination.

He also told the

reporters that BERTRAND FUSSEL had written to hin to say

that he wished to form an organization in England to be

called the "Who Killed Kennedy Committee?".

to say that the Committee had now been forned, without a

chairman,

but with GARST as secretary.. They have received

some publicity in the British press,

in particular in the'

"Daily Worker" of June 12 and 30, ,1964.

According to LANE,

the objects of the Conmittee were to collect and disseminate

all available information and evidence relating to the as-

sassination of President Kennody and to insure justice for

the Oswald Lamily.

T-I has no information to show to what

extent the Committee is actively pursuing these objects.
