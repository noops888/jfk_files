interrogatories submitted tor consideration in a letter,

dated soptember 5, 1978, to the Attorney

by G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counscl and Director, HSCA.

#3. What background, it any, did the interro

gator have in interrogations? What knowledge

did the interrogator have with respect to Oswald's

background?"

There are no retrievable FBl statistics upon wrich

to base a quantification of the interrogatory

experiences

the SA personnel who interviewed Nosenko on the

five pertinent

occasions.

Suffice it to say, the techniques of cooperative

and hostile interrogations are integral aspocts of the training

and almost daily duties of SA personnel:

In that regard, it

is noted

that during the February and March, 1964 interviews

SA Poptanich had alnost 13 years of SA experience; SA Taylor

31 yoars of SA experience; SA Walter had completed

almost 17 years of SA experience;

and SA Gheesling

13 years of SA experience.

Further, their respective personnel

disclose the following:

SA Poptanich was then fluent in the Russian language

(Nosenko's native tongue).

The Annual Report

of Performance

Rating, dated March 31,

1962, noted that SA Poptanich,

the previous twelve months, had

articipated in the interro

gation of a Soviet defector

and his knowledge of the Russia

language and mores of the Russian people proved most helpful

relative thereto.

SA Taylor,

on September 11, 1962, received an incen

cive award in recognition of the suporior fashion his responsi

bilities were discharged over an extended period of time.

Special Agent in Charge (SAC) of the Washington Field Office,

in submitting a recommendation for the incentive award,

commented that SA Taylor had demonstrated exceptional ability

in the interrogation and debriefing of three Soviet defectors,

all of whon were intelligence officers.

SA Taylor's Perfor-

mance Rating for the period April 1, 1963--Maïch 31, 1264,

noted be was recognized as the finest interrogator on tho

Soviet espionage squad in the Washington Field

Office, which

accounted for his assignments to interview Sovict defectors.

He was assigned

exclusively to supervisory responsibilities iclative to the

assassination of president Konnedy.

concerned Oswald and/or the assassination

of President Konnody.

A docent has been located which indicates that FBl personne.

did record the February 36 and 21, 1964, interviews of Nosorko,

among others.

Since no recordings or transcripts have been

located, it

can be. assumed that the recordings

wore used by

the interviewing SAs to check the accuracy ot

their notos

It is

further assumed that, upon verifying the accuracy of summary

reportings of the interviews, the recordings were disposed

they were made,

although no record, of such disposition can be found.

Sunnary

reportings of

the five portinent interviews are extant, and

were delivered to the HSCA on March 21, 1978.

15. What criteria, if any, was used to determine:

a. what subjects to question Nosenko about;

b. how much tine to devote to each subjeet!"

FBI files do not contain a specific enumeration of

criteria used to determine the particular subjects Nosenko

was to be questioned about nor

the

amount of time to be devoted

to each subject' in the questioning.

"6. What significance - with respect to possible

foreign involvement in the assassination as well

as to the issue of Nosenko's bonafide: (sic did

the FBI attuch during the years 196$ 1968 to Nosenko's

she fil does not perceive any significant evidence of

coreign involvement in the assassination of President Kennedy,

nor does the Fil perceive any credible evidence that Nosenko's

defection was a Soliet ploy to mask Soviet governmental

involvement in the assassination.

Therefore, the FBI is

satisfied that Nosenko reported the facts about Oswald as he

knew then.

"8. If the answer to question 6 is different froin

the response to question 7, when did the change

The FBI had no direct accoss to Nosenko from

April 3, 1964 until April 3,

1969,

and thorcfore was not in

a position to make an objective assessment of his bona fidos

nor of the veracity of information furnished by him.

On October

the FBI advised the Central Intolligence Agency (CIA) that,'

based upon a review of naterial provided by CIA, the FBI

found no substantial basis to conclude that Nosonko was not

a bona fide defector; however, the FBI did not reach any

overall, definitive conclusions regarding his bona fides
