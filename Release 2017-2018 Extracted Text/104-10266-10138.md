I-3's contacts

and actions agree with what L-3 tells ROKTON and

to allow ROWTON to be prepared to cover himself in his relations

with L-3.

d. To discretely investigate I-3's sources of income,

1.e., to see if his income from teaching art classes (and more

recently from his rife's

i salary from Wire) are sufficient to

account for his scale of living, whatever it 1s.

There are indications in the file that: the "homework"

as outlined above has not yet been done.. The Station mas

no 1

querled in DIR 39039 and in DIR- 07441 as to, the above matters.

It is noted in MEXICO CITY- 8944 that the Station said that

it did not as yet have "independent checks" on this agent,

beyond evidence of entry to the Cuban Embassy furnished by

LIONION photo surveillance, and in fact had only his word on

claimed actions and statements: and that LIENVOY and LITAINT-2

confirm that L-4, L3's wife, is definitely employed as a

secretary to LIRING-l as claimed by L3. The Station tended to

doubt that 1-3 is a Cuban plant but said that even if he were,

that it was no additional risk (the Station was -ferzing to

a proposed

trip by L-3 to Cuba) since L3 would

be provided with

# suitable uncheckable explanation as to how L-3 obtained info

on the LOPEZ case •

e. Check as suggested in DIR 07441 on status

of

LIRING-4's father, who is presuzably a Chinese, repurtedly in

the United States. This is of interest in view of stringent

U.S. entry requirements laid on Chinese.

SOURCE

MEXICO, MEXICO CITY

FIELD NO.

A MEXICAN INTELLECTUAL WIO IS A NEW, UNWITTING REPORTING ASSET.

SOURCE HAS CULTURAL AND FAMILY TIES IN CUBA. HE OBTAINED THIS

INFORMATION DURING CONFIDENTIAL DISCUSSIONS WITH OFFICIALS OF

THE CUBAN EMBASSY IN MEXICO.

1. ACCORDING TO WORD RECEIVED IN MEXICO FROM AN OFFICIAL OF THE CUBAN

MINISTRY OF FOREIGN TRADE, CUBA'S MOST URGENT REQUIREMENT AT THE MOMENT IS.

THE CHARTERING OF 24 SHIPS, VARIOUSLY DESCRIBED AS "OF MEDIUM TOVAGE" AND

"OF APPROXIMATILY 10,000 TONS", FOR USE IN 1967. THIS PROJECT IS BEING

HELD AS SECRET INFORMATION, AND MANY CUBAN OFFICIALS DO NOT KNOW OF IT, EVEN

IF THEY ARE COCERNED WITH TRADE AND SHIPPING MATTERS.

COMMENT:

THE SHIPS ARE POSSIBLY TO BE USED TO TRANSPORT THE 1967 SUGAR CROP, WHICH

ALLEGEDLY WILL REACH LARGE PROPORTIONS.

COMMENT: PERHAPS A REDUCTIOI

IS EXPECTED IN SOVIET ASSISTANCE IN THE MATTER OF SHIPPING.)
