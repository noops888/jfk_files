17 July 1975

Subject:

SSC Request to Breckinridge During his 2 June Appearance,

for Files and Materials relating to the 1967 IG Report on

Assassinations, Including Tab A after Page 77 of the Report.

Response:

A search has been made for the files of the Chief, WH

Division in 1967 (Desmond Fitzgerald), and those of Col.

J. C. King. At that time Mr. Fitzgerald was alive; he

has since died and his files do not exist as an integral

collection, although portions may exist in different

holdings in WH Division. Col. King had retired at the

time of the IG inquiry, but he was still working under a

special contract and was at the Headquarters Building

at Langley where he had retained some personal files;

his files are no longer identifiable.

Other materials, reviewed by the Inspectors in 1967 were

limited in nature, some of which have been made available

to SSC Staff members in envelopes in which they have been

held since 1967. The SSC Staff members have had access

to the project files of @JWIN, WIROGUE, ZRRIFLE and

EMDEED.

Should they wish

access to the files relating to the anti-Diem coup, they

can be made available on request.
