WRING EVENING DECEMBER 2ANICARAGUAN OFFICIAL

WAS (S)

PERMITTED BY MEXICAN

AUTHORITIES TO SEE AND TALK VITA' ALVARADO

FOR THE FIRST TIME CONVERSATI ON TOOK PLACE IN PRESENCE OF TWO

MEXICAN PQICE OFFICERS.

SAYS THAT ALVARADO WENT BACKS

TO HIS ORIGINAL STORY OF HAVING WITNESSED PAY-OFF TO OSWALD

ALVARADO CLAIMS HIS STATEMENT TO

TEXICAN AUTHORITIES WAS

IN CUBAN CONSULATE HERE MADE UNDER DURESS ATTER FORTY-EIGHT HOURS*

COF CONTINUOUS INTERROGATION:

AG REE DEWITH

THAT ALVARADO

NO HO AT EXAL WAS TAE SETTE MAVE NO WAS TENNE WAS THERE

IS BASIS FOR ALVARADO'S CLAIM OF DURESS•

TAS REPORTED EARLIER ALVARADO"S STORY IMPRESSED US HERE BECAUSE OF

WEALTH OF DETAIL.

I DID NOT IN

THE BEGINNING KNOW THAT ALVARADO

HAD DEFINITELY FIXED DATE OF PASSAGE OF MONEY. TO OSWALD AS

SEPTEMBER 18 AND WAS ASSUMING THAT ALVARADO'S STORY WAS CONSI STENT

WITH OUR DATA ON, OSWALD'S ENTRY IN AND EXIT FROM MEXICO.

AFTER

VE LEARNED ALVARADO. HAD PINPOINTED SEPTEMBER

18 WE AT FIRST ONLY

KNEW THAT THE FBI HAD DEFINITELY PLACED OSWALD IN NEW ORLEANS

ON SEPTEMBER 17°

STILL LATER WE WERE INFORMED BY KEENAN OF

WASHINGTON THAT OSWALD HAD WITHDRAWN BOOKS FROM NEW ORLEANS PUBLIC

LIBRARY ON 'SEPTEMBER" 19.

SEPTEMBER

18 DATE DURING MEXICAN INTERROGATI ON UP TO THE TIME HE

§CHANGED HIS STORY AND SINCE WE CANNOT PLACE OSWALD ON EASTERN

AIRLINES FLIGHT FROM AND TO NEW ORLEANS BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 17 AND

19 THERE IS ONE APPARENT FLAW IN ALVARADO'S STORY•

A SECOND APPARENT FLAW, ALREADY MENTIONED, IS ALVARADO'S INSISTENCE

THAT HE TELEPHÖNED AMERICAN EMBASSY FOUR TIMES ON SEPTEMBER 2D.

CAND DAYS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING•

CALVARADO

CURANTLY CLAIMS HE MADE FOUR TELEPHONE CALLS TO EMBASSY EXTENSION

F13 INSING NAME OF JORGE KYNAUT (PHONETIC), AND WAS EACH TIEN

FERNST ON

REBUFFED BY A "WOMAN" THIS IS THE NUMBER

OF THE EMBASSY SECURITY

@FICER TO WHICH ALVARADO WAS REFERRED WHEN HE TELEPHONED THE

EMBASSY

ON- NOVEMBER 25.

HE COULD HAVE GOTTEN THE TEXTENSIO

NUMBER FROM THE NOVEMBER 25 CALL• WE ARE CONTINUING TO. INVESTIGATE

THIS FACET BUT EARLIER, MORE GENERAL INQUIRY PRODUCED NEGATIVE

RESULTS.

SEVERTHELESS THERE IS SUFFICIENT POSSIBILITY OF TRUTH IN THETPART

ALVARADO'S STORY ABOUT HAVING SEEN MONEY PASSED TO OSWALD TOE

WARRANT CONTINUED INVESTIGATION OF ALVARADO EITHER IN THE US

FAN: NICARAGUA

SAYS THAT NECARAGUAN GOVERNMENT IS

AGREEABLE TO ALVARADO'S INTERROGATION IN NICARAGUA BY US OFFICIALSKS

I THEREFORE SUGGEST THAT FBI AND CIA CONSIDER SENDING REPRESENTATIVES

TO MANACUA FOR INTERROGATION

PRUPOSES• *PERHAPS A POLYGRAPH

EXPERT SHOULD ALSO BE SENT.
