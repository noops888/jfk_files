AMSPELL had been working fervently at collection of intelligence on

electronic materinis requisite to just such an undertaking. This was

dismissed,

however, as another example of students

of Havana at about 2330 hours local time on the night öf 24 August 1962

has been reported substantially in Reference D. The press has

covered it to the point of satiation, but the essentlal press reporting

was forwarded in Reference E. As the smoke of cannon and cold war

exchanges cleared;

the operation could be analyzed for what it was,-

and

what it meant

As stated earlier in this report, it was an Agit/Prop actions

realized this and prepared for a

deluge of propaganda on the action.

By the time JMWAVE had received instructions from Headquarters to

caution them about gloating over their success, this propaganda cam

paign was already launched,

Publicity was a buyers market for them

and there was not enough ANSPELL participants or officials to satisfy

the demands of press,

television, radio,

and personal appearances.

Their degree of foresight and organization can be appreciated by the

fact that the AMBARBS throughout the hemisphere were standing by with

instructions for agit/prop should ODYOKE have decided to prosecuze thes

AMHINTS participating in the action.

JWAVE, however,

cannot afford to be very objective about AMSPELL

• revolutionary zeal that not only aggravates the cold war exchanges,

but places the Task Force - and ultimately,

KUBARK - in an awkward

and untenable control position as far as PBRUMEN independent action

is concerned.

It would be no overstatement to say that this exile

group could sink a Soviet vessel and force ODYOKE to the brink of

war.

Therefore,

on 30 August, when AMPALN-4 reported that the espst

attack on Havana was the first of a three-phase plan, the seconds tiger.

it was obvious that the JWAVE/KUBARK control relationship with a

AlSPELL must be submitted to a profound and firm reappraisal. This

was done under the supervision

of REUTEMAN and through a series of

conferences with TROUCHARD, ZAMKA, NOEMAYR and NELANDER. The results

were reported

to Headquarters by REUTEMAN In KAVE-7899 on 30 August.

1962.

In short, this Reference reviews the ANSPELL independent course

of action,

consequent liability KUBARK, framework of the JMWAVE

relationship with

AMSPELL and present commitments, and pointed out

that

the ultimate test

of the control issue would

be the severance

of AMSPELL support funds.

Headquarters comments and

concurrence

were requested but during the first weck in September,

this problem

was treated during a series of conversations between

the Chief of

Station and the Chief of Task Force.

A final decision is pending at

the date of this writing.

The ASPELL raid on Havana 24 August 1962 provided the dominant

theme for ANBARB exploitation subsequent to that eventee inasmuch ag

this adventure was undertaken without JWAVE knowledge or concurrence

and counter to the policy of our government, it would be superfluous

of us to

comnent

that we regard the event with misgiving from'a stand

point of KUBARK

At the same time,

a clear

distinction must be made between the activitles of the AuBARB section

of ANSPELL and those of the organization's military leadership:

essentially, AlBARB serves only to promote propaganda activity in the

Latin American countries where AMBARB delegates are assigned: and

additlonally some delegates work on covert assignments with locator

KUBARK Stations in fulfilling GYROSE objectives..: The overt tasks of

the AMBARBS, however, serve to exploit the propaganda value of such

events as the 24 August raid and to capitalize upon information demon-

strating the fallures of Castroism and Sovietization of Cuban life;

as such, the AlBARBS are themselves removed from the center of such

controversial activities as the 24 August raid or the threats of

ANHINT-2 against shipping in Cuba.

Naturally,

the AlBARBs support

the policies of their organization and the statements of its leader:

as noted above, they could also bring their facilities to bear to

embarass ODYONE, at the behest of AHHINT-2, in the even ANSPElt lahed

to mount a concentrated propaganda barrage condemning ODYOKE esponse:

to AUSPELL's unilateral undertakings.

It 1s clear that the AuBARD

potential to mount any such campaign

controlled by KUBARK

of support -for ANsPeLl cantbe

only to the extent that local stations have

direct

dealings with the AMBARBs in Latin America®

JMWAVE, for its part,

exerts every possible effort to assure that AMBARB representatives

will not engage in any propaganda action likely to embarass ODORE

or GIROSE policy courses.

We are encouraged to belleve that,

while

overall

JHWAVE

control of ANSPELL appears negligible at this time on

the large issues of striking direct blows against targets of oppor

tunity,

We

do have fairly good control over the subordinate AMBARB

leadership within ASPELL.

ting AMBAR assets to become embroiled in controversy over AMSPELL

paramilitary undertakings.

AMBARB is sensitive to what it would regard as any RUBAR utto

its organizationg therefore, in the matter of locat

Station funding of AMBARBS; we have

agreed that at least one AMBARB

delegate in each country will continue for the present to receivehis

salary directly from AMBARB. AMBARB argues that only by this means

can AMBARB retain the minimum control over its people necessary to

Insure satisfactory execution of overt ANBARB propaganda activities

(the furding for these overt activities will also continue to be paid

for the present by AYBARB to its delegates):

JAWAVE does not belleve

it would serve a useful purpose at present for local Stations to g

attempt to fund these regular AUBARB activities, since it should bes

remembered that these overt ANBARB activities give the organizatlou

its public reason for being and, therefore, a cover factlity undere

whIch AbbArEs may be utilized bj local Stations for covert activite

Since AMBARB is

jealous of administering the funds for its overto

activities, JMWAVE feels it should be permitted to do so for the sake

of KUBARK rapport with the group. At the same time,-although AMBARB

delegates receive from: AMBARB propaganda materials thematic guidance,

and funds to cover local experses in carrying out

the overt AMBARB

mission, local Stations are not precluded from exerting influence on

AMBARB activities supporting GYROSE objectives.

Since the local

Stations will be paying the salaries of all but one AMBARB in their areas,

as well as funding covert activities,

it should be possible for lócal

Stations to influence overt AMBARB work

substantially.

By agreement

with AMSPELL, all covert utilization of AMBARBS by local Stations is

strictly by arrangement between the ANBARB representatives themselves

and the local Stations,

and-AlSPELL expects no information concerninga

such covert use

either from JAhAVE or from its AMBARB representatives

in the field.

There is an additional advantage in permitting AMBARB to pay the

allowing AMBARB to disburse funds, provided by JWAVE,

By this means JNWAVE is in a position to obtain

from AUBARB a coordinated monthly progress report of the total overt

reference in assessing the overall AlBARB overt effort.

Naturally,

part, UNWAVE does everything possible to elicit from AUBARE

as complete

an accounting as possible of the monthly propaganda

activity undertaken by each ANBARB delegation throughout Latin America.

Since it is doubtful that a timely, coordinated picture of all ASBARB

activities in all countries could be obtained by means of separate

local Station progress reporting on overt AXBARB work,

Biders this system the most satisfactory for keeping tabs.on such

widespread activities; we are doubtful that any centralized control
