Laurel Street,] an employee of A-Z Paper Company, [630. South

FIALLO, it is to be noted, is the source of

the original allegation on which this investigation was

based, namely, that subject had some time ago planned to

. Moscow. FIALLO advised on Septem-

ber 10, 1964, that since he was last interviewed by an

I to determine subject's sympathies

regarding FIDEL CASTRO. Source advised that he has had

subject in the past and has seen him

several times since July 6, 1964, however, he did state that

he has not had too close a contact with the subject during

the last 30 days.

FIALLO stated that he has endeavored

in his contacts with the subject and with other persons who

are known to the subject to ascertain whether the subject

could possibly be pro-CASTRO or perform any activity on

behalf of CASTRO.

FIALLO stated that after all of his efforts

he still retains his original firm belief that the subject

is definitely anti-CASTRO and added that he has learned nothing

that would cause him to believe that subject was anything

but anti-CASTRO.
