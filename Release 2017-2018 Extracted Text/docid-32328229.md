SEUKET

an interview with BARTONE, Miami would be so advised. In view

of this fact, it is not recommended that BARTONE be interviewed

in subject case at

this time. JACB,

this will not be done.

In VIEW Of BARTONE's past record, it is doubtful as to whether

he would furnish accurate information regarding any contact

made with him by A.

W. LAPPIN. It is recommended that the

Washington Field Office,

in connection with its proposed

Interview of A. W. LAPPIN,

keep in mind the contact made from his

room at the Leamington Hotel to DOMINICK BARTONE's residence

on February 23, 25, and 26, 1963. If LAPPIN will furnish

substantial information regarding this contact, it is recom

mended that consideration be given to then interviewing

BARTONE.

However, until such time as BARTONE is made avail-

able for interview in the case mentioned above (Bufile

29-31889), It is not belleved interview with him is desirable.

Information in this report is also set out in

report captioned,

"PAUL, MAGLOIRE," IS - HAITI," (Miami File

105-7441) (Bufile 105-55981) •

FRANK NATHAN has been a subject in the case

entitled, "ABRAHAM TE ITE LBAUM,

was.; ET AL, PERJURY • BRIBERY, "

(Miami File 74-48) (Bufile 74-1459) • There appears to be. no

objection to direct interview with FRANK NATHAN in this matter.
