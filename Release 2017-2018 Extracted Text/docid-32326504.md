CONFIVENTIAL.

C.

LESLIE RICE,

Jonnell Gas Co., 20 Broad

St., NYC, on 5/20/60, advised that he had spoken with DI.

CARLOS MARQUEZ STERLING on 5/20/60 in NYC, and DI. STERLING

and his associates were going to attempt to have meetings

with DI. TONY VARONA in an effort to form a coalition among

the Cuban exile leaders in the United States.

RICE stated

that DI. MARQUEZ STERLING does not know the present whereabouts

Of TONY VARONA, and RICE advised that he would make a telephone

call to MI. STEVENSON, of the U.S. State Department in Washington,

D. C. on the afternoon of 5/20/60, in order to advise the •

State Department in the event they knew the whereabouts of

VARONA, that MARQUEZ STERLING desired to meet with VARONA and

discuss the possibility of a coalition. RICE also advised

that from his conversation with MARQUEZ STERLING, he is convinced

that STERLING, due to his age and ill health, believes that

the heavy responsibility of being the leader of the movement

would be too much for him and he would prefer to take the

position of an advisor to TONY VARONA and other Cuban leaders.

RICE also stated that arrangements have been

made for a general press conference to be held in NYC at

the Savoy Hilton Hotel on 5/26/60 from 10:30 A.M. to 12 P.M.

for all newspaper representatives in the New York area.

RICE advised that they were most desirous of having a meeting

between MARQUEZ STERLING and VARONA and SANCHEZ ARANGO, and

at this press meeting announce the coalition of their forces

against the present Cuban Government.

The Newark Office is requested to attempt

to identify the A.. Ex. M.F.A.R.C. and LANDRON.

The Bureau and interested offices will

be kept advised of developments in this matter, and the NYO

will identify the occupant of apt. 33, 618 West 187th St., where

EUSEBIO MUJAL met with NY 2865-PSI and possibly with TONY VARANO

and SANCHEZ ARANGO.
