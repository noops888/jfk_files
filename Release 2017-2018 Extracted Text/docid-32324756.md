Laws and in 1957 was convicted for violation of the

Theft From Interstate Shipment Statute. In 1960, DIOGUARDI

was reported connected with JOSEPH INDELICATO; In 1961 he

was reported connected with STEVE ARMONE, now deceased;

and in 1962 was reported associated with ANTHONY RICCI in shy-

DIOGUARDI owns and operates Angelo's Restaurant

in Dade County, Florida, and according to MM I- X6on

January 24, 1963, DIOGUARDI allegedly found out that his

partners, ANTHONY RICCI and JULIUS KAPLAN, were stealing

JEK Law 10(a)2

MM T-66advised that LAFF had a big horse book

in Chicago, but that in the Miami area is considered a

medium size bookmaker, doing some lay-off business in

Chicago.

On November 18, 1961, LAFF was arrested by Internal

Revenue Service Agents while leaving a North Miami, Florida,

apartment where he allegedly handled $100,000.00 daily in

lay-off action and was charged with the Failure to Possess

a Federal Wagering Tax Stamp, but on July 25, 1962, the

United States District Court at Miami acquitted LAFF of this

charge.

MM T-67advised that since his arrest by Internal

Revenue Service, LAFF has been extremely careful not to

accept any bets

from outside the State of Florida so as to

insure that he is not susceptible

to prosecution by the

Federal Government. He stated that LAFF is probably

continuing bookmaking activities, but will not take bets from

out of the State and will not make telephone calls outside

of Florida.

MM T-68 advised that recently LAFF has been spending

all of his afternoons playing cards at the Normandy Isle

Golf Course, Miami Beach, Florida.
