9. Approach to the subject will be on the basis

that it is known that he had traveled in Western Europe and

the Scandanavian countries during 1959 and 1960 and to

determine if, during his travels or residence abroad, he was

approached by any individuals who were employees or citizens

of Soviet or satellite countries. SIt will be pointed out to

the subject that other individuals who have traveled and

resided in Europe have been contacted by such persons.

It

is felt that such an approach is general, yet sufficiently

specific to allow

subject to recall contacts with citizens of

other countries and offer him the opportunity to volunteer the

details of the contacts which are the basis for this investigation
