formed the Anti-Communist Legionnaires, an organization

of military affairs; was considered psychopathic, and the

training camp was disbanded. TANNER left the organization,

which was then taken over by GERALD PATRICK HEMMING.

a Cuban national residing

1n Miami, Florida, had access to

a boat located somewhere in the Florida Keys and planned

to make a reconnaissance trip from Florida to. Cay Aguilla,

Cay Sal Bank, British Islands, located north of Cuba.

The trip was

supposed to have been made on May 27, 1961,

and GERALD PATRICK HEMMING and two or three other members

They planned to make a clandestine trip to Cay Aguilla

and then return to set up a military base to be used

for future commando raids against Cuba. MM T-1 explained

that the plan was indefinitely postponed inasmuch as

boat. CAPO was afraid to leave Florida, fearing that

U. S. Border Patrol would arrest him. CAPO has no immediate

plans for aay such trip in the near future.
