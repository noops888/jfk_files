INTRODUCTION

The following summary and analysis is not intended to be

all inclusive, that is to contain a specific comment on all organi-

zational, operational, personality and case type information furnished

by Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO. To aitempt to do so wouid be repetitious

and confusing to the reader and would not be of material benefit in the

formation of logical conclusions concerning the rather limited areas of

primary concern.

This summary will not contain a detailed psychological

assessment of NOSENKO nor will it contain a recitation of the numerous

theories which have been promulgated in the past concerning varying

aspecte oi the NOSENKO case. This summary will be primaril;

directed toward the question of whether NOSENKO was or was noi

dispatched by the KGB, whether his claimed KGB career is relatively

plausible and whether he has since late October 1967 been cooperative in

a reassessment of the entire case for or against NOSENKO. NOSENKO

has admitted certain lies and exaggerations in the past but claims that

these were of a personal nature, intended to enhance his own importance

but not to mislead tois Agency in any material matters of an operational

or policy nature.

In order to avoid any misunderstanding oi ibe phrase "bona

fices" as considered in this summary. NOSENiO will be judged primarily

on whel. he voluntarily defected to this Agency without KGB kno redge.

and whelder his 1962 and early 1964 contacts with representatives of this

Agency were known to ibe IGB. Motivation and certain other pertinent

aspects will be considered, but his admitted previous errors, lies and

exaggerations will not per se warrant a conclusion that NOSENKO is not a

"uuna fide" defector.

There is not an accurate standard or scale of measurement

against which information concerning NOSENKO can be balanced or

correlated to determine ii he is or is not a dispatched KGB officer. For

purposes of this analysis and summary, an arbitrary list of areas

considered pertinent has been compiled. Readers may difier in regard to

whether this arbitrary standard is a completely accurate standard, but it

is felt inat the information from NOSENKO and information from otner

sources derived through independent investigation will permit the reader

to assess the information in toto against any standard he considers

appropriate.

The previous summary on NOSENKO entitled, "The Exami-

nation of the Bona Fides of a KGB Defector, " has been considered in

SUMMERY OF DEVELOPVENTS IN NOSENKO CASE

SINCE 30 OCTOBER 1967

Since 30 October 1967, interviews with Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO

have been conducted by one individual not previously known personally to

NOSENIO but who bas been aware of the NOSENXO case since June 1962.

Interviews have been detailed and very extensive in scope, have

been recorded and transcribed, and have covered the entire life and caree.

of NOSENKO without regard to whether a particular aspect had been

covered during previous interview or interviews.

NOSENKO, although naturally apprehensive during the firet few

interviews, has been cooperative, has developed a relaxed attitude, and

the interviewer has noted no significant reluctance to discuss any aspect

of bis life, career, or activities. On occasion NOSENKO has indicated a

reluctance to make positive statements in certain areas previously

considered at a minimum extremely controversial. This reluciance

was understandable and when it became apparent to NOSENKO that the

interviewer would not dispule co disparage his statements without adequate

reason, this relucianee on the part oá NOSENKO, in tre opinion oi the

interviewer, totall; disappcared.

During the interviewing period, pariicularly in the cirst sir monine,

¡OSINKO materially assisted ine interviewer by preparing approximately

sixty memoranda on such diverse subjects as his lie, motivation ior de-

jection, individual cases, noies which he furnished to CLA in 1904, KGB

organization, and KGB officer and agent personalities. As an example

of the scope of this work by NOSENKO, four of the memoranda included

remarke concerning approximaiely 875 KGB officers, 100 KGB agents,

35 GRU officers, and 400 other Soviet nationals. These liste were alpha -

betically arranged and the above indicated cooperation oi NOSENKO has

materially assisted in the orgarization and evaluation of inormation

iurnished by him during current interviews.

Copies of transcripis of interviews with NOSENKO and related

memoranda have been disseminated to the FBi and the Cl Stafi. Special

Agent Elbert Turner and Special Agent James Wooten of the Washington

Field Office/FBI in particular have given great assistance in research

and compilation of new or additional information and the FBI has inter-

viewed or reinterviewed a number of United States citizens concerning

whom NOSENKO has furnished pertinent information.

YURIY IVANOVICH NOSESKO

As indicaied in the itroduciion to this summary, incormation in

regard to Yuriy ivanovich NOSEN/O will be considered against an arbi-

trary but realistic list of areas considered vertinent to the question of

whether NOSENKO voluntary defected to lins Agency without KGB

knowledge, and whether his 1962 and early i904 contacts with represer!.

atives of this Agency were known to the KGB.

It was noted thai motivation and certain other pertinent aspects

would aiso be considered bui that his admitted previous lies and exag-

geraiions wouid not per se warrant a conclusion that NOSENKO is not a

"bona fide defector."

The following is a list of the areas considered pertinent and which

are being given specific consideration. Attached is a separate section

containing remarks in regard io the designated areas oi A - H.

A. Is NOSENKO identical to tre person waom he claims

to be?

B. Is the claimed KGB career of NOSENKO plausible?

to the KGB and/or has the information furnished by

NOSENKO been of significant benefit to Western Intelli-

gence?

F. Is there evidence of KGB deception or "give away" in

a conclusion that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB?

which could justily a dispatch of NOSENKO by the KGB

A. Is NOSENKO identical to the person unom he claims lo be?

During interviews NOSENKO has furnisaed detailed information in regard

to his family, his activities as a youth, ine schoois he attended, assoc-

iates of his father and nother, and his own associates. The period

under consideration in this section is int period preceding his entry

into ine First Department, Second Chieí Directorate, WVD, in mid-

March 1953.

Information furnished by NOSENKO concerning his father and

mother and his early life, together with other information such as a

comparison of phoiographs ul NOSENKO and a photograph of his father

and confirmed travel of his mother to Western Europe in 195ó with

Madame KOSYGINA, conclusively establish that he is Yuriy Ivanovich

NOSENKO, the son of Ivan Isidorovich NOSENKO, the Minister of Ship-

building in the USSR prior to his death in 195ó. This is also satisiactorily

supported by personal-type information furnished by NOSENKO concern-

ing other associates of his father and motner.

Since, as indicated above, there is considered to be no doubt

that Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO is the son of the former Minister of

Shipbuilding, a detailed study of his life prior to 1945 (age 18) is of

¡ile or no value in assessing lie bola fides or non-bona fides oi

MOSENKO. An expose of his youlniul indiscretions, of nich re sas

admitted a numver, is of no import in a discussion of whether NOSENKO

was or was not dispatched bi the #GB. Obtaining any coilaterai first-

hand injormation in regard io NOSENKO uciore 1945 would be oi

negligible value, but there actually is supporting iniormation from

NikoLay ARTAVONOY, a delecior iron the Sovict Nary, concerning

the claimed attendance by NOSENKO at a military-naval preparaiory

school in Leningrad.

NOSENKO, during current interviews, has stated that he grad-

uated from the Institute of International Relations in 1950 and had

attended the institute since 1945. He has explained inat he shouid have

graduated in 1949 since it was a four-year course, but failed the final

examination in Marxism and iherefore was required to attend the institute

sor a longer period of time arc again take his final examinations.

Based on iriormation furnished by NOSENKO concerning co-

studenis and the Institute, there is no reason to douot inat he acruaily

attended and graduated from the Institute oi International Relatiors in

1950. The previous controversy in this matter was complicated by

NOSENKO who, in 1964 after his defection, stated in a biography that

he had graduated from the Institute in 1949. Actually this statement

by NOSENKO in 196% resulted in conilicting information since NOSENKO

on 9 June 1962 during his first contact with CIA had stated that he

"completed toe Institute of International Relationa in 1950. " NOSENKO

has given the explanation that he changed the date of his graduation to

1949 because he did not wish to admit that he had ailed to graduate in

1949. NOSENKO explained that this change in his date of graduation

caused him to pre-date his actual entry into Navy Intelligence to 1950

instead of 1951 and his aciual entry into the KGB from 1953 to 1952.

The abore action by NOSENKO is included in what NOSENKO has

characterized as his "stupid blundera." The latter is a rather apt

characterization of his now admitted lies and exaggerations but is not

evidence that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB. It is evidence oi

a certain personality trait of NOSENKO who has in the past by his own.

admission tended io enhance his importance and astuteness by graphically

portraying his personal participation in KGB activities concerning which

he had knowiedge but did not personally participate.

The claimed service of NOSENKO in Navy Intelligence during

March 1951 to early 1953 in the Far East and the Baltic areas has been

seriously questioned in the past. Specific comments on this period of

time are contained in a separate section of this summary, but it is

considered that the recent interviews oi NOSENKO satisfactorily sub-

stantiate his claimed service in Navy Inteiligence during March 1951

to eariy 1953.

Attached is a typed copy of a handwritten memorandum completed

by NOSENKO on 31 October 1967. This is a biographical statement con-

cerning his iife and KGB carcer. No effort has been made to correct

grammatical errors or speiling since to do so would be in conflict with

the manner in which current interviews were conducted; namely, to give

NOSENKO an opportunity to recuunt his life and activities to permit a re-

examination oi the entire case. The comprehension and fluency of

NOSENKO in the English language was adequate for interview purposee

in October 1907 and both have matcrially improved since that time.

interviens of and memoranda prepered by NOSENKO since

• 31 October 1967 have not indicaled any material discrepancies with the

siatemerts of NOS EINiO in the altached memorandum. One change tiat

has been niade by NOSENKO is that he now dates his transfer from the

First Department, Second Chief Directorate (SCD), KGB, to the Seventh

Department, SCD, as occurring in the latter part of May 1955 rather

than June - July 1955 as indicated in the attached statement. NOSENKO

also now dates the period in which an unsatisfactory "characterization"

neither of the above changes are considered to be of a significant nature.

An effort has been made during current interviews to differentiate between

errors due to faulty memory and discrepancies indicative of deception by

NOSENKO.

I finished 6th class and went with parents to rest to the soutn (Sochi)

but soon began the war and we returned in Moscow.

In October 1941 I witl my mother went in the evacuation in

Cheliabinsk (Ural), where I finished 7ih class in spring 1942. In

July-August we returned in Moscow.

In August I entered in the Moscowvite military-navy special

intelligence of the ministry of mililary navy concerning my future work.

Passing state exams I failed Marxism-Leninism and with a

group of fails I was passing state exams once more.

In October 1950

I finished the institute and received a diploma.

I was accepted in the navy intelligence in the 13 of March 1951

and in March 17 went by a train to Soviet Harbour (intelligence of 7in

B. 15 Pac claimed KGB career of NOSENKO plausible? In the

past the theory has been advanced that NOSENKO was never an officer

in the KGB. information of a detailed nature from NOSENKO concern-

ing the KGB, particularly the Second Chief Directorate, has been s0

extensive as to invalidate any contention that he was not a KGB officer.

It is considered that NOSENKO was a KGB officer in ine claimed

Departments curing the claimed periods of time and served in the claimed

positions in each Department. It is interesting to note that NOSENKO has

not materiai; varied in his statements in regard to the above since his

original contact in June 1962 (with the exception of his change to 1952 as

date of his eniry into the KGB and then later reverting to the date given

in 1962). There have been some variations in dates of a minor nature,

as indicated elsewhere in this summary, but these are of month or day

of transfer irom one Department to another aná not considered critical

or evidence di deception. NOSENKO has admitted previously giving false

information in regard to rank and medals, but his basic story concerning

his KGB career today is not significantly different from the fragmentary

version he gave in June 1962.

Basically the following is now considered to have been the KGB

career of NOSENKO:

Mid-March 1953 - late May 1955, Firat Section,

First Department, SCD

Late May 1955 - December 1959 (1958 - December

1959 - Deputy Chief of Section) Seventh

Department, SCD

January 1960 - December 1961, Deputy Chiei of

Section, First Section, First Department,

SCD

January 1962 - July 1962, Chieí of First Section,

Seventh Department, SCD

July 1962 - January 1964, Deputy Chief of Seventh

Department, SCD

(NOTE: The term Deputy Chief is being used throughout this

summary, but the better terminology probably is "Deputy to Chief."

The position of "Deputy Chief" in United States Government parlance,

including CIA, is not synonymous with the term "Deputy Chief" as used

in Soviet organizations and more specifically in the KGB. As an example,

a Chief of Department in the KGB or the Chief of a Residentura abroad

may have 2, 3 or even 4 deputies, one oí wnom is given the titie oi

First Deputy. This particular deputy acts in the absence of the Chief

of Department and in generi: has supervisory functions over all the

Department sections.

The ception to the latter is when the Chiei of

Department retains direct supervision over what he may consider ine

most imporiant section. Other deputies have supervisory functions only

over designated sections or organizational components. )

During current interviews and in prepared memoianda, NOSENKO

has furnished detailed information which it is considered substantiates

his claimed positions in the KGB. Detailed remarks on these topics are

contained in separate sections of this sunmary.

It is realized that GOLITSYN, although confirming that NOSENKO

was a KGB officer in both the First Department and Seventh Department,

SCD, has stated that NOSENKO remained in the First Department until

circa 1958 and that NOSENKO was not Deputy Chief oi the First Section,

First Department, in 1960. It is impossible to correlate this information

with the above indicated opinion that NOSENKO left the First Department

in late May 1955 and was Deputy Chief of the First Section, First Depart-

ment, in 1960, nor is an adequate explanation of these variances available

it this time. On the other hand, it is not Icasonable that NOSENKO

would lay claim to ine litie of Deputy Chief oi the Firsi Section, First

Department, l this were noi true when he cicarly knew of the visits oi

GOLITSYN to the Firsi Section in 1960 - 1961 and of his conierences

with officers ciosely associated with NOSENKO at that time.

NOSENKO has aiso mentioned a number of officers oi the SCD

or former cilicers of the SCD who transferred to the FCD with wiom

he was personally acquainted and who were also known to GOLITSYN.

A number of these officers were officers from whom GOLTSYN has

stated he obtained certain information or through whom he became aware

oi certain activities inciuding Viadislav M. KOVSHUK, Gennadiy I.

GRYAZNOV, Vladimir Ivanovich PETROV, Yuriy I. Guis, Vladimir

A. CHURANOV, Y'ergeni; GROMAKOVSKIY and Vadim V. KOSOLAPOV.

The statemont of NOSENKO that although he had heard of

GOLITSYN he had never personally met GOLITSYN, stands in conflict

with the statements of GOLITSYN that he, GOLITSYN, had met and

talied with NO: NKO in the SCD in the late 1950'5. The description

of GOLITSY vi iris meeting is that of a casual encounter in the halis

rather than a specific office visit. In light of this, the absence of any

reason why NOSENKO from his point of view should remember such

an encounter and the absence of any reason for NOSENKO to lie on this

issue, it is eminently reasonable to conclude that the encourier took

place but that NOSENKO simply has no recollection oi it, merc is

no reason to attach sign cance to this lapse of memory.

The previous opinios thai NOSENKO did not noid the claimed

inition oi Deputy Chici, First Sertion, First Department, Curing 1960 -

reiative to his KGB carcer. This particuiar aspect will be covered in

over what duties the position of Deputy Chief oi Section in ine SCD, KGB,

entails or does not entail. Il is a fruitless exercise to attempt to judge

whether NOSENKO was Deputy Chief oi the First Section in 1960 - 1961

on the basis of whether his knowledge of the toial activities cí the Firat

Section was commensuraie with the knowledge of a Deputy Branch Chief

in CIA in regard to the activities of the entire Branch.

Whether NOSENKO was a Depuij Chief of Section in ide SCD,

KGB, must be judged on the basis of what were the duties oí a Deputy

Chief of Section in the SCD and in particular what were his cuties in

the particular assignment. The organizational structure of the KGB

may or may not have some similarities to the organizational structure

of CIA, but any similarities are surely not such as to permit a judgment

as to wnether NOSENKO heid a certain claimed position on the basis

of a comparison oi his activities and responsibilities with that inherent

in a somewhat similar position in CIA.

One of the most important difierences between United States

agencies or organizations, inciuding CiA, and the bureaucratic structure

of agencies or organizations in the USSR, including ine KGB, is the

salary structure. Pay oi a KGB officer is based on military rank and

on actual position held with an additional percentage increase for longevity

and language qualification. Actual position held is important from a

monetary vievpoint in addition to the prestigc. As an example, ine

difference in montaiy

salary between a captain and a major is iwenty

rubles and the dilference in salary between a Senior Case Officer and

a Deputy Chief of Section is also twenty rublus. An increase in miitary

rank alone has limited pay advantages, as for example a Lieutenant

Colonel who is oruy a Senior Case Officer receives less pay than a major

who holds the posizion of Chief oí Section.

During current interviews, an eifort has been made to obtain

Irom NOSENKO statements concerning his responsibilities in the various

claimed positions. The judgment on whether he held or did not bold

the various claimed positions, in view of the absence of any factual

supporting or refuting information, has necessarily been based to a

considerabie degree on the logic of the statements made by NOSENKO.

Admittedly this is not the most satisiactory way of resoiving the

questions, but it is the orly metnoù possibie ai this time.

• C. Fias YOSENKO given an acceptable explanation of nis

motivation in contacting Cil in 1962 and for his deiection in 1904? Of

the cigat listed categories waich are being given specific consideration

in the matter of the bona fides of NOSENKO, this category is probably

the most difficuit in which to present a logical position with actual

support. There are too many intangible aspects involved and although

motivation is an important factor, full resolution of the motivation

problem is not a paramoun: factor in deciding whether NOSENKO is or

is not a dispatched agent. NOSENKO could have contacted this Agency in

1962 and defected in 19u% without KGB knowledge and yet even at this late

date have failed to disclose some important events of a personal nature

which actually were important ingredients in his ultimate decision.

Defectcis are humans and have at least the normal reluctance to admit

unfavorable information woick.toey consider of a personal nature.

On 31 October 1967 NOSENKO, following a request, furnisned a

handwritten memorandum on the topic of his motivation, a typed copy of

which is attached.

The memorandum, although not grammatically correct,

is quite understandable and is worthy of review. The tenor of the memo-

randum is one of increasing disillusionment with the Soviet regime.

NOSENKO and others of his generation have lived in a Soviet society

throughout their entire lives. The envizorment is an importani factor

of influence in

the life of an individual and true disillusionment is at

best usually a graduai process in vich, many factors, some recognized

and some not recogrized by ihe individual, save played a role in varying

degrees.

NOSENXO, until 1955 ard possibiy until the death of his iather

in August 1956, could be compared io the profligate son of wealiby

parents in the United Staies who linally graduates from college and obtains

employment perhaps in the firm of his father without actually earning any of

the luxuries be has enjoyed. The faiber of NOSENKO was not only wealthy

by Sovici standaris bui also held a diga government position. The

influence of his fatcer and the name di dis iater undoubtedly was an

important if not the must imporiani lacior in NOSENKO even being

permitted to enter the Naval RU and the K03 even though NOSENXO is

particularly reluctani to admit, perhaps even to himself, that this was

the primary reason.

The above should not be construed as any reflection on the

actual intelligence of NOSENKO, but rather as an explanation of how

NOSENKO could have even entered the Naval RU and KGB. His

periormance in both prior to 1956 by his own admission was such that

be probably would have been summarily ierminated ii he had not been

the son oi tue capable, respecied Minister oi Shipbuiiding.

Il a certain amount of speculation is permilied, ibe

disiliusionment o1 NOSENKO, who iost many personai advantages

following the death of his father inciuding a personal automooile, may

have actually started soon after the leach of his fatner. That NOSENYO

is undisciplined is supported by his acmissions relative to his life in

the USSR and his behavior both in 1962 in Geneva and for a period oi time

after his defec ion in 196%. NOSENKO was addicted to women, liguor. and

the material things which can be purchased with money or obtained through

influence.

A question has been previously raised regarding his motivation

in contaciing CIA in 1962, particulazly his statement that he needed money

and would sell "two pieces of information." NOSENKO das stated that he

wanted to make a contaci with the Americans, that de vas not emotionally

ready to defect, but thai he subconsciously believed inai if he made a

contact he wouid be making an ultimate commitment from which he could

no longer retreat.

NOSENKO has stated that he gave considerabie thought to the

beat way to contact the Americans so that he would be believed and not

rejected and came to the conclusion that he would offer to sell some

information. NOSENKO staied that he thought if he approached the

Americans stating he was a "KGB courierintelligence officer who wanted

to give information, " he would not have been believed and would have

been peremptorily rejected. NOSENKO stated he had difficulty deciding

how much money to ask for and how to make the approach, but finally

decided to do it through Dawa WAnts whom the KGB considered was with

American Intelligence.

The above statements by NOSENKO are not in conflict with the

record. NOSENKO did offer to sell "two pieces of information, " almost

immediateiy gave more information, made no significant demands for

morey, and in fact his price for "two pieces of information" was

ridicuiously low by American standards. NOSENKO has during current

interviews stated, as he first stated in 1962, that he had spent excessive

amounts of money in one or two riotous evenings. However, NOSENKO

has during current interviews stated that he could have covered his

expenditures by other means without receiving any money from the

Americans.

Operational Memo # N-4

SUBJECT: NOSENKO, Yuri Ivanovich

The following is a typed copy of a hundwritten memorandum

furnished by Subject on l November 196%, foilowing a request on

31 October 1967:

What were the motif and the reasons which have led me to

the decision to breake with the Soviet Russia? The only definite is an

understanding of the situation in the Soviet Russia, the knowledge of

the methode of the communiat regime,

the knowledge of the real foreign

and interior policies of the Soviet government and the iaith in the rigit-

nese of the iree world.

It svas not a decision which was accepted or could be accopied

in a month or a year. This decision was slowly growing in me. I

think that the beginning was in the studentship.

Living with my parents and being in the circles of the parent'e

and my acquaintances I knew more then there was written in newspapers

and periodice and that was propagandized by radio and TV. Working in

the Far East and later being in trips in different regione and cities of

Russia I found out much better the life and conditione of the life of the

people of the Soviet Russia,

When I worked ll years in MVD-KGB i underatood and found

out very many things, detaile and the rcal deal of the existing regime,

about methods

of the work of MGB-MVD-KG3 and about their doings.

about hundreds of thousande of the pcople of Russia who were (and

still are) considered "politically" dangerous and around whom was

(and atill ic) going an active wori of all organs KGB.

At the same time when I was several times abroad I have

seen personally the so-called "decay" at the West. I have seen in

reality how is living people.

Several times when I was abroad I was thinking about staying

at the West and not returning in Russia, but only one thing was keeping

me . my family.

In 1862 in Switzerland I made the acquaintance with the

Americans.

From my part "the sell of the information" was a real

show. I was thinking that they wouid not beiieve me otherwise. In

that period of the time there was going a big struggle in me to stay

abroad of to return home till the last days of living in Geneva and even

when I was returning home in Vienna.

In 1962-1963 1 decided definitely that i did not want and could

not live more in the Soviet Russia. In this period of time I have done

all my best to go as soon as possible abroad.

D. Is the iniormatior furnished by NOSENKO to CIA concerning

KCB operations, personalities, and organization reasorably commen-

surate with his claired KGB career? The conclusion is that the infor -

mation furnished by NOSENKO concerning KGB operations, personalities,

and organization is more than reasonably commensurate wiin his claimed

career in the KGB from mid-Varch 1953 to his defection in early February

1964.

In reaching the above conclusion, consideration has been giver.

to his claimed departmental assignments and claimed positions in each

department. Certain allowance has been made for lauily memory with

consideration being given to whether there is any indication of deception

or whether the failure to recali a particular item of intercet can logically

be attribured to the vagaries of the human mind. Inere is, oi course, no

accurate standard oi measurement which would permit a positive deter-

mination as to whether inability to recall certain deiails or events is

actually due to the fact that the human mind cannot recall all past events

or could be attributed to willful deception.

An efíort has been made to determine if there are any particular

patterns or areas where NOSENKO has indicated he did not recali

specific matters or certain details, and no pallern or specific areas

have been noted.

NOSENKO, in fact, has an

unusually good memory

as evidenced b; the extensive iniormation iurnished by NOSENKO purely

from recollection, In adcition, there has been no material reiuctance

on the part of NOSENKO io discuss his entire life, KGB officers he has

known, KGB organization and procedures, or other topica di nièrest.

NOSENKO has furnished considerable detail concerning KGB

officers whom he has inown at various periods in his entire KGB career.

He has been very consistert in information furnished and has frequently

added certain details which he recalied at a later date.

Certain remarks will be made in another section in regard to

the volume and scope of iniormation furnished by NOSENKO. This in-

formation is nol sciective, but is ad excellent indicator that NOSENKO

was assigned to the first Depariment and Seventh Department, SCD,

during the claimed periods of time and held the claimed positions. Con-

sideration has been given to his various clained KGB assignments in

evaluating the information iurnished in an effort to assess whether his

indicated knowledge was commensurate with his claimed position during

a particular period of time or suggested the possibility that he did not

occupy ibe position wnich he claimed to have heid.

It is consicered thai iniormation furnished by NOSENKO supporta

his claimed positions in the SCD. It has not been possible to substantially

confirm tarough collaieral sources that NOSENKO srived in bis claimed

positions. Neither has it been possible to obtain from other sources an

applicable description of the duties or responsibilities of an individual

holding any of the positions NOSENKO claimed to have held after 1958. It

is feit there can be no question that NOSENKO served in the capacities of

junior case officer, case officer, and senior case officer during 1953 - 1957.

As regards the duties and responsibilities of a Deputy Chief of Section,

Chief oi Section, and Deputy Chief of Department, and whether NOSENKO

held these various claimed positions, a considerable amount of personal

judgment bas been necessary. This personal judgment has been nade in

as judicial a manner as possible, with full knowledge that any opinion in

regard to the above is largely dependent upon information from NOSENKO.

NOSENKO has compiled detailed diagrams of the actual offices

he claims to have occupied and surrounding offices curing the four pri-

mary periode of time: 1953 - 1955, 1955 - 1959, 1960 - 1961, and 1962 -

1963. He has prepared specific memoranda concerning his co-officers

and other personnel, ard chunges of persorrel, as well as diagrars

of the oifices of the Chiai and Deputy Chiefs of the SCD during 1956 -

1964. This material is internally consistent. Furthermore NOSENKO

could not possibly have known that this detailed information could not

immediately be checked for accuracy, at least in part, with a source

or another officer who has defected since mid-1964. li these diagrams

and memoranda were not relatively correct, NOSENKO, who is quite

astute in matters of counterintelligence, would hardly have voluntarily

prepared the material in such detail. This ype of information is

peculiarly adaptable for analysis by a knowledgeable snurce or by another

defector and could, if not relotively correct, permit a rather positive con-

ciusion that NOSENKO was lying of fabricating information.

NOSENKO has furnished quite specific information on KGB

operations during te 1953 - 1955, 1955 - 1959, 1950 - 1962, and 1962 -

1963 periods of time. As migat be expecied, his specific inowledge is

Less for the 1953 - 1955 period; but his own personal situation and attitude

until 1955 - 1956, which are mentioned elsewbere, should be given

consideration. In any event, be has furnished adequate information so

that his claimed assignment during 1953 - 1955 is considered sufficiently

substantiated even though his actual job periormance undoubtedly

deserved a low rating.

The knowledge of NOSENKO concerning cases, KGS operations,

and other officirs can consistenily be reluted to his claimed department

and position assignmeni during the 1953 to January 1964 period, The

scope of his inowiedge of his own department when considered in toto

is broader after 1957 than before, which is compatible with his claim of

increased responsibilities. His knowledge of the work of otber departments

of the SCD irom the late 1950's on is also more extensive, which is aiso a

further indication that NOSENKO actually beld the claimed positions

during this period of time.

SIORE:

F. Is there evidence of KGB decegtion or "give away" in

incormation furnished by NOSENKO which wouid warrant a conclusion

that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KCB? The conclusion in this

summary is that NOSENKO was not dispatched by the KGI. In

reaching this conclusion, a full examination of the above sion has

been both a necessary and iniegral part.

It is inherent that the volume of information furnished by

NOSENKO is only one of the factors which should be given consideration

in arriving at a conclusior that NOSENKO was or was noi dispatched by

the KGB. Il NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB, the KGB would have

surely been willing to sacrifice certain information of value to the KGB

in order to support the bona fides of NOSENKO.

However, if NOSENKO

was dispalched, it must have been to accomplish or iurther a KGB

purpose or mission, the nature of which has been and continues to be

unknown.

An examination of the circumstances under which NOSENKO first

contacted CIA in Geneva in 1962 and his behavior during these contacts is

particuiarly pertinent since during this period of time NOSENKO would

have surely been under direct KGB control it there are any implications

of KGB dispatch in the NOSENKO case.

NOSENKO has staied that his original approach to "sell iwo

pieces of information" was his own idea as to what was most likely to

be successful. NOSENKO has biated that he wanted to make a contact

with the Americans, was not psychologically adapted to defect at the

time, and felt that if he mexely stated that le was a "KGB counter-

intelligence officer who warted to give information," he very possibly

would be rejected. It should be noted that NOSENKO even during his

first contact did not limit his remarks to the "two pieces of information"

and began to talk quite freely on other matters.

IL NOSENKO was dispatched, it is felt that he, during his 1962

contacts, would have beer very carefully brieied and that his remarks

or statements would have not been of a nature which could cause any

suspicion in regard to the bona fides cí NOSENKO. Instead, a current

review of his statements and remarks during his five contacte in 1962

indicate that his many errors, exaggerations, and actual lies were quite

likely typical of a braggadocio element in the personality of NOSENKO

and may also have been evidence supporting the statement by NOSENKO

that he usually had a few drinke of liquor before each contact in

Geneva.

NOSENKO, during his five contacis in Geneva, made many

statements wnich in retrospect were impossioie, and the investigation.

of which could only have raised ceriain questions con arning NOSziKO.

The following is a list of the more obvious areas in nich NOSENiO

made gross exaggerations or mace incorrect or impossibie statements.

(a) NOSENKO claimed he personally was with

Oleg M. GRIBANOV, Chief of the SCD, during the

recruitment gitch to James STORSBERG. (This was

a lie and an interview with STORSBERG with display

of photograpi would have disciosed inat JOSENKO

did not participate. )

(0) NOSENKO was involved in the recruitment

approach to Russell LANGELLE. (This was a lie and

LANGELLE was available for interview.)

(c) NOSENKO said he recruited LUNT (riorace

LUNT) in Bulgaria. (Actuaily NOSENKO never met

LUNT.)

(d) NOSENKO claimed personal contact with Edmund

STEVEN'S woo, according to NOSENKO, Lar been recruited

by the KGB. (NOSENKO actually had never personally met

STEVENS and oniy had seen STEVENs once at a distance. )

(e) NOSENKO dated the recruitment of "ANDREY"

in Moscow as 1949-1950. At ihe same time he furnished

information that "ANDREY"' ¡vbo is considered identical to

that Roy RHODES, also a recruited agent, was assigned to

Moscow, 1951-1953. "ANDREY" (SMITH) was actuaily in

Moscow 1952-1954.

(5) NOSENKO said be, GRIBANOV, and anoiser officer

met Edward Ellis SMITH. (NOSENKO has since staied he did

not meet SMITH and that his only role was obtaining a foreign

typewriter and paper for a KGB agent involved in the SMiTH

operation. )

(g) NOSENIO in a number of instances spoke in the

first person, saying "We did this, " or "We did that, " in

reference to a particular KGB activity in which he now admite

he was not involved but had some knowledge. (I

NOSENKO was under KGB control in 1962, both he

and the MiGB should have known that these indicated

exaggerations would eventually lead to a question

concerning the bona fides of NOSENKO.)

In 19ó2-1963 a number of similarities were noted between

information furnished by NOSENKO and information which had been

furnished by GOLITSYN prior to June 1962. These similarities were

quite striking and gave riseto certain suspicions of NOSENKO because

he provided information which the KGB would presumably have considered

already compromised as a result oi the defection of COLITSYN. Certain

of the similarities ai the time could only be explained in terms of

NOSENKO being a dispaiched agent. The following are some examples of

the similarities noted.

(a) Both furnished information in regard to

Johan PREISFREUND.

(b) Both furnished information in regard to a

military code clerk case (James STORSBERG).

(c) Both furnished information in regard to a

trip of Vladislav KOVSHUK, under an assumed name,

to the United Staies. (GOLITSYN was sure it was

connected with a reactivation of an agent formerly in

Moscow, or a recruitnichi of ar American formerly

assumed name which KOVSHUK usca. )

(a) Both furnished information in regard to

microphones in the United States Embassy in Moscow.

(e) Both furnished information in regard to

Edmund STEVENS and Isaac Henry SHAPIRO.

The above list is not compiete nor does it indicate the actual

differences in the amount of information furnished on any partic diar

topic by GOLITSYN and NOSENKO. To cite the above in detail in leis

summary is believed unnecessary since the only point of real interest

is whether the fact that NOSENKO was aware of certain events, cases,

or situations of which GOLITSYN was also aware raises a legitimate

question concerning the bona fides o NOSENKO.

The above area of concern has been thoroughly examined and

it is considered that the fact that NOSENIO furnished some informasion

on certain cases or situations previously mentioned in lesser or

greater detail by GOLITSYN cannot logically be construed as evidence

0001084

that NOSENKO was dispaiched by the KGB. NOSENKO has during

current interviews satisiaciorily sourced his information in alir.: st

overy instance. in a few insiances he has said he dia not recali

how he learned of a particular piec. oi information but these

apparent lapses of memory were not large in number and are

considered to be in no laj suspicious.

The general area in which there was a similarity between

information furnished by GOLITSYN in late 1961 - early 1962 and

information furnished by JOSENKO in June 1962 and which would have

been the most significant insoíar as the security of the United Staies

Government was or is co-cerned relaica io certair activities centering

around or in the First Department, SCD.

It is the conciusion of this summary that NOSENKO was an

officer of the First Section, First Depariment, SCD, during 1953-1955

and was Deputy Chief of the same section in 1960 - 1961. Therefore,

the fact that NOSENKO furnished information concerning certain cases

or situations in the Firs: Depariment and the fact ihat GOLITSYN

furnished information concerning the same case or situation is not

unusual or necessarily suspicious. NOSENKO has stated that GOLITSYN

been noted and commented on in another section of this summary.

GOLITSY* häs jurnished certain iniormation which he re-

ceived from officers of the First Section, First Department, SCD.

In each instance where this information, which was fragmentary, couid

not be immediately correiated with information from NOSENKO, it was

previously considered to be evidential i deception of lying on the part

Of NOSENKO. This position, however, failed to allow for the possibility

that the discrepancies between the two sources were, at leaet in certain

instances, more apparent than real.

In certain instances it has now beer possible to correlate irag-

mentary information from GOLITSYN with information from NOSENKO,

making it evident that in these instances the differences could not be

construed as in any way reflecting against NOSENKO. The four examples

cited below represent two probable correlations, (a) and (b); one possible

correlation, (c); and one instance where no correlation is possible at this

time, (d):

(a) GOLITSYN furnished information which he

received in April-Vay 1960 from Gennadiy GRYAZNOV

that an attempt had been made by the KGB to recruit an

the information but that the Soviets hoped she would return

to Moscow so that further work could be undertaken to

effeci her recruitment. Fie did not recall the name of the

secretary, but did recall ibat it was a long and "German

sounding" name.

NOSENKO has furnished information in regard to a

recruitment aïempt againsi Collette SCHWARZENBACH,

who it is considered is identical to the "American secretary"

referred to by COLITSYN. However, SCHWARZENZACH

was not a female secretary in the American Embassy, but

had been employed as a secretary to the wife of Ambassauor

BOHLEN during 1955 - 1956 and from 1958 - 1959 was employed

as a correspondent by the United Press in Moscow. The

recruitment attempt against SCHWARZENBACH, according to

NOSENKO, occurred in 1959 and was an operation of the First

Section, First Department, SCD.

the spring of 1960 that GRYAZA,. V had developed an operation

Gu was "9y per ceni sure" tout the target wouid be recruited.

This is believed to undr. liedly be a reierence to the case oi

James STORSBERG Wio was actually the subject of a recruit-

ment approach in 1961.

There is considered to be a good possibility that

GOLITSYN actually learned o the above information from

GRYAZNOV in early January 1961 when he was again in Moscow

rather than during the spring of 1960 when GOLITSYN was

preparing ior lis assignment to Helsinki, Finland. This

theory is supported by information on page 163 of the previous

summary that GOLITSYN has stated he learned in January

1961 from Vladisiav M. KOVSHUK (Chief of the First Section)

that Johan PREISFREUND had recently been used in the

successíul recruitment of an American employee oi the

Embassy.

Johan PREISFREUND was used in the STORSBERG

operation, according to NOSENKO, and NOSENKO was also

aware that GOLITSYN had a conversation with KOVSHUK about

PREISFREUND since GOLITSYN wanted to use PREISFREUND

in Heisinki. NOSEYKO has stated he was not present during

the above conversation. It is very possibie that KOVSHUK

exaggeraied a littie in his conversation with GOLITSYN in tie

matter of why GOLITSYN could not use PRE'SFREUND as an

agent.

NOSENKO has furnished extensive irormation in regard

to the James STORSBERG case and with due consideration to

tie accuracy and recoilection of GOLITSYN, there does noi

appear to be an adequate basis for questioning the bona fides of

NOSENKO on the basis of the differences between the report-

ing by GOLITSYN of information he received from GRYAZNOV

concerning what is considered to have been the James

STORSBERG case and detailed information furnished by

NOSENKO concerning the James STORSBERG Case. The

exact date of the recruitment aîtempt against STORSBERG

has not been positively established, but it is consiciered to

have occurred before early May 1961 and probably in the

statements by STORSBERG himseif.

(c) Page ló3 of the previous summary contains

information from GOLITSYN wnich he had received from

GRYAZNOV in April or May 1960 inat an American

employee of the Embassy in Moscow was either recruited

or prepared for recruitment on the basis of a homosexual

compromise beginning in 1959 and concluding in 1960.

The previous summary also states shat according to

GOLITSYN, the KGB had photograpned the American in

various homosexual acts, but SHELEPIN, who had just

become Chairman of the KGB, was at the time stressing

iceoiogical rather than biacimail recruitments. SHELEPIN

aid not exclude future use of the photographa which the KGB

would hold in reserve.

NOSENKO has furnished information concerning the

homosexual compromise of Robert BARRETT, who was a

guide at the United States Exhibition in Moscow in 1959, and

with whom "SHIMELEV" and "GRIGORIY", two homosexual

agente oí NOSENKO, became acguainted. Work against

the United States Exhibition was the responsibility of

the Ninti Depariment, SCD, but various Departments

were participing under he direction of the Ninth

Department.

One of the above homosexual agente succeeded in

involving BARRETT in homosexual activities which were

photographed by the KGB but, according to NOSENKO,

although the photographs were of a good quality, the KGB

was unable to use the photographs in 1959 because of a

general ban by the Central Committee on the recruitment

of the United States Exhibition guides due to the planned

visit of Presidert EISENHOWER to the Soviet Union.

NOSENIO also stated that the compromising material

and information on BARRETT was later given to the First

Department and that BARRETT was recruited by the Second

Section, First Department when he returned with another

Exhibition in 1961, and that he, NOSENKO, was not involved in

the recruitment operation. BARRETT, following his return

to the Unied Staies in January 1902, confessed to the

FBi thaihe had been recruited in 19ó1 on the basis of

compromising photographs which had been taken

during his 1959 trip to Moscou.

Although it cannot be established at this

time, it is possibie that the incormation furnished

by GOLITSYN which he had received from GRYAZNOV

actually refers to the Robert BARRETT case. It should

be noted that Robert BARRETT could not actuaily be

characterized as an "American employee of the Embassy

in Moscow. "

(d) Page 162 of the previous summary conia ins infor-

mation from GOLITSYN that in the spring of 1960 when he

visited the First Section, First Department, SCD, he learned

from GRYAZNOV that GRYAZ.\OV had as an agent an Embassy

code clerk who was scheduled to be transferred io rielsinki.

GRYAZNOV indicated to GOLITSYN that the code clerk had

already furnished the KGB with some inforration, that he was

the transier of the code cierk materialized, GOLITSIN

might have the coùe clori as an agent in Helsinki.

NOSENIO has furnished no information which ca. be

correlated in any way with the above information from

GOLITSYN, bui neither has the information from GOLiTSYN

resulted in an identification despite the considerable investigation

which has been conducted in the matter. Although this is

considered to be a valid lead, it need not necessarily reier

to a code clerk who was in the United States Embassy in

Moscow during 1960 - 1961. I: is also poesiole thai the previous

remark by GOLITSYN concerning the above "code clerk" who

might be transferred to Helsinki as well as his cited remarks

in a-c could be clarified or ai least additional information

obtained if a specitic reinterview on these matters was possible.

The trip of Vadim V. KOSOLAPOV to Helsinki, Finland in

November 1960 should be mentioned in any comparison of information

from NOSENKO with information from GOLITSYN. This conflict is

to accompany an American Embassy code cieri on the train to

Nioscow and that KOSOLAPOV pianned io sirike up an acquaintance

with the code clerk which could be continued in Moscow.

The American Embassy code cierk referred to above was

undoubtedly John GARLAND and the train manifest lists John GARLAND

and Viktor KOLOSOV (Vadim V. KOSOLAPOV) as passengers on the

same train from Heisinki to Moscow. NOSENKO is aware of the

identity of John GARLAND but claims no knowledge of the above trip

Of KOSOLAPOV to leisinki, although being well aware oí a previous trip.

NOSENKO, as Deputy Chief of tae First Section specifically

charged with work against code clerks, shouid have been aware oi the

November 1960 trip of KOSOLA?OV to and from Helsinki. His lacis of

knowledge may or may not be explainable in terms of his other activities

such as his trip to Cuba in November-December 1960 but it cannot be

interpreted as evidence NOSENKO was dispaiched by the KGB since, if

he had been, the KGB should have briefed NOSENKO on the trip of

KOSOLAPOV to Helsinki in November 1960, as thie was an event sce

KGB knew GOLITSYN was aware of.

his immediate reply has been io the elleci that "I didn't work in the ECD,"

or "You shouid ask GOLiTSYN about thut."

In connection wiil any consideration of whether lae contact of

NOSENKO with CIA in Geneva in June 1962 could have been initiatea by

the KGB as a result of tine defection of GOLITSIN, the timing oi certain

events should be noted. GOLITSYN defected os 15 December 1961.

NOSENIO deparied from Moscow in March 1962 for Geneva, Switzeriana,

where he remained until 15 June 1962.

It is felt that it would have been practically impossible if not

impossible for KGB officials to complete an assessment of the actual of

potential damage which could result from the dejection of GOLITSYN.

selec: NOSENKO as the indiviqual wno would be dispatched to counier-

act ine possible damage, and appropriaiely brief YOSENKO prior to

his departure for Gereva in March 1962. Thertiore, i NOSENKO

was dispatched by the KG3, it would appear that pians ior this would

have predated the defection of GOLITSYN and inat any GOLiTSYN

aspeci could only be a clated aspect and not the basis for ine original

plan to dispatch NOSENKO. In audition, if NOSENKO was dispatched.

it would hardly seem necessary for ite KGB to send NOSENKO io

Geneva two and one-half months before his first contact with CIA.

The theory has also been considered thai NOSENKO could have

been dispatched to confuse and divert American inteiligence and taus

to protect an important KGB penetration or penetrations of the United

States Covernment, particularly CIA. This is a ineory which should

and has been given fuil consideration, out it is noi possible to factualiy

substantiate or refute this ibeory in the absence of specific information

that high-level KGB penetrations do or do not exist..

Actually, as regards NOSENKO, the primary area waich should

be given consideration in the above matter is if all the information from

NOSENKO is accepted, what effect would or could it bave on the efforts

of American counter-interigence tú deiermine the identity of and

take appropriate action against KGB pereirationg of the United

States Government. The only answer to this question seems to be

that there wouid be jittle consciation or assurance to American inteili-

gence even if every statement by NOSENKO was accepted at face value.

The only specific area in which NOSENKO could be even con-

sidered to claim fuli knowledge is the taited States Embassy in Moscow.

In this area hie statements could be construed as assurance that there

were no recruitments of American personnel in the United States Embassy

in Moscow from 1953-December 1963 with he exception of "ANDREY"

(Dayle Wallis SMITH) and Herbert HOWARD. The basis for this

expressed opinion of NOSENKO is considered elsewhere in this summary

and analysts may differ as to whether a recruitment could have occurred

of which NOSENKO did not have knowledge, assuming that his statements

are made in good faith, it shouid be noted, however, that at this time

there is no specific incormation which is in direct conflict with the

expressed opinion oi NOSENKO.

NOSENKO, as previously mentioned, has never claimed any

particular knowledge of FCD activities.

In addition, he does not claim

to be aware of all recruitments o Americans by the SCD.

against members oi deiegations, ioreign businessmen, foreign studenis,

ard individuais in the ÜSSR on the invitation oí a Soviet organization or

à component of the Soviet Government is extremely limired and at best

mainly of a collateral nature.

NOSENKO does not even claim any detailed krowleúge oi

activities of the Second Section (Active Line) of the Firsi Departmeni, SCD,

nor does be claim to know all of the cases of which the Chief of the Seventh

Department was aware. The latter is specifically supported by certain

notes brought out b; NOSENKO which are short references to a number

o! Seventh Department cases which are identified only by the KGB code

name. These notes, according to NOSENKO, were made when he had an

opportunity to review a notebook beld by the Chief of the Seventa Department

and constituta the only knowledge NOSENKO had of these particuiar cases.

HI. Is there ar; evidence that the contacts of NOSENKO in 1902

or in 196s with CIA vere known to ine CB prior to his ¿cfection or

that NOSENKO was ever briefed by the KUB relative to his behavior

or KGB objectives during these contacis or alter his aclection? The

conclusion is that there is no evidence that ice contacts of NOSENKO

in 1962 or in 1964 with CIA were inown to the KGB prior to his

defection and that NOSENKO was never brieled in any manner by the KGB.

The basis for ice above conclusion is substantially contained in

previous sections. It is being treaied bere as a separate area of interest

since it is a sulficiently important area as to warrant individual consideration.

It is recognized thai since positive factual confirmation suci as

the KGB file on NOSENIO is not available, any conclusion concerning

whether NOSENKO was of was not dispatched by the KGB can only be

based on the full review of availabie indormation from NOSENKO,

collateral sources, independent investigation and the opinion of the

individual analyst concerning the significance or non-significance of

each item of available information.

The conclusion that the contacis of NOSENKO with CIA in 1962

and 1964 prior to his defection were not known to the KGB is

0001107

SECRET.-

necessarily based in pari on a judgment as to whether any of his

activities or information logically varrant a substantial suspicion

that they were or could be in any part the result of KGB direction

or control. One of the particular areas considered was his apparent

behavior during his contacts with CIA in June 1962 and the conclusion

was that it was incomprehensible that he could have been under KGB

control at that time.

Consideration has been given to the possibility that his 1962

contacts with CLA were not known to the KGB, but became known to

the KGB later and NOSENKO was doubled by the KGB. it was con-

cluded that there was no basis for or information which would warrant

serious consideration of tie above possibility aside from the separate

conclusion that the KOB wouid be very unlikely to reward a traiter in

KGB eyes by sending him again to Geneva where he would be quite free

to defect.

Worthy of comment in this section is the fact that NOSENKO,

during his 1962 contacts, expressed considerable concern over his

personal security, requesting that knowledge concerning his identity be

kept to an absolute minimum, that no communications be sent to the

PREVIOUS CONCLUSIONS RE NOSETKO

AS CONTAINED ON PAGES 357 - 360 OF

"THE EXAMINATION OF THE BONA FIDES OF A KGB DEFECTOR"

The foliowing is a quote of the previous conclusions in the case of Yuriy

Ivanovich NOSENKO. (The specific conclusions have been site, the designation

of A - G for purposes of easier correlation with otier sectiona vi this summary.)

"SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

CONCERNING NOSENKO'S 30%A FIDES"

"NOSENKO claims that he served for a decade in the KGB in

successively senior positions of alnoriy from which he derived

extensive knowledge of the scope, character, and results of KGB

operatione against Americans in the Soviet Union in the period

1953-1963. To substantiate his claim, he provides an impressive

array of information about KGB personnei, organization and opera-

tions which, to the extent that is has been confined, is presumptive

evidence of his bona fides. Various Soviet oificials, including

intelligence officers, have generally corroboraied NOSENKO's

claims. According to some of these sources, NOSENKO was a

senior KGB officer who occupied a series of sensive positions, who

0001114

---

## Page 117

13-00000

enjoyed considerable autority and trust despite personal short

coming., and whose acfection, 'the gicatest loss ever suffered

by soviet Intelligence', paralyzed lie work of em kGß eas

• Legal Residency, and justified the formulation oí plans to assas-

sinate him."

"The examination has compared each element of NOSENKO'e

biography relerant to his claimed KGB service with known

facts and reasonable surmise. The examination reilects the

test to which his accounts were pul: whether his accounte are

internally coherent and consisten with known fact, and whether

he actually gained the information lie has from occupying the

KGB positions he claims to have heid. In short, is he what he

says he is, according to his own accounts?"

"This examination had led to the ioilowing findings, arrived

at independently:

A. NOSENKO did not serve in the Naval RU

in any of the capacities or at the places and times he

claimed.

B. NOSENIO did not enter the KGB in the

manner or at the time he claimed.

C. NOSENKO did not serve in the American

Embassy Section througaout the 1953-1955 period as

he claimed.

C001115

---

## Page 118

13-00000

D. During the period 1955-1960, ie was neither

a senior case oilicer in, nor Diputy Chiti of, the Seventh

Department American-Britisi Commonwealth Section.

E. NOSENKO was neither Depuly Chief of ine

American Embassy Section nor a senior officer or

supervisor in int Section during the period 1961-1902. (sic)

F. NOSE,XO's claims, that in 1962 se was Chief

of the American-British Commonwealth Section and was

thereafter a Deputy Chief of the Sevenin Department, are

not credible.

G. NOSENKO has no valia ciain io certainty

that the KGB recruited no American Embassy personnel

berveen 1953 and his defection in 1964.

Inese lndings difier somewnat with respect io degree of probability

or certitude, but they reflect the preponderance of avaiiable evidence

in each instance. "

"The above judgments, if correct, rebut presumptive evidence

OÍ NOSENIO's bora fices. The contradictions in NOSENKO's accounts

of his life and KGB service are so extensive as to make nis claims

as a whole unacceptabie. While truth and fact in this case frequently

G001116

SECRET

---

## Page 119

-..

cantot be establisned with certainty, it is evident that truth and

laci are not what NOSENKO reites. By ahnosi any test, virtually

any of NOSENXO's above claims are impugned by laci or probability,

or coniradicted or retracied in his on stalements. NOSENKO is

nor what he claims to be, and thus he is not a bora lice deíector."

"Given the conclusion that NOSENKO is not a bona fide

dejector, it is necessary to attempi io determine his true motives

for contacting American intelligence and for providing the iniormation

he has given. Here, it must be recognized inat the evidence, largely

consisting of NOSENKO's own assertions, does not permit unequivocal

conclusions. Neverheiess, the question cannot be ignored. The

character of the information NOSENKO has conveyed, the fact that

some of his false claims have been corroborated by Soviet officials,

and the necessity to make decisions about NOSENKO's future all

require that at leasi a provisional judgment be made. "

"Of the reasonable explanations advanced ior NOSENKO's

misrepresentations, the chief ones are that he is a swindler posing

as a former KGB officer for reasons of personal advantage; that he

suffers from a deranged personality or unbalanced mind; that he has

greatly exaggerated his actual rank, status and access in the KGB, for

simply personal reasons; or, finally, that he is a dispatched KGB

agent. "

"The first iwo possibilities are easily dismissed. That

NOSENKO is not simply & swindler woo falsely claims for personal

advaniage to have been à KG3 officer is cvident, we believe, rom

tne confirmed details of KGB organizaiion, persornel and operations

which he has provided and wiich couid only derive from within the

KGB itself. "

"Second, as noted in ine text, extensive psychiatric and

psychological examination by qualified specialists rule out the

possibility that NOSENiO's actions and testimony are the product

of a deranged personality or unbalanced mind."

"It is somewhat more plausible inat NOSENKO is a KGB

officer who served in at icast some of the components for some

or all of the time periods that he ciains, bui wno greatly exag-

geraier his positions, rank and access to intormation, and

invented some matiers outright, to achieve greater status with

American Intelligence. This explanation, however, fails to

accommodate the fact that several KG3 officers have asserted

that NOSENKO did in fact nold senior positions in the KGB. Also,

NOSENKO's assertions with respect to his rank, GRIBANOV'e

patronage, the recall telegram, and the like, cannot be justa

product of his own invention, since these were the subject of

comment by other sources. "

"Because none of ine above explanations is consistent with

the data developed in interrogations and investigations, we are

left with lie hypothesis inat NOSENKO was dispaiched by the

KGB. Whiie this e planation does not reconcile all the anomalies,

none of inem renders it untenable. "

"In the absence of further revelations by NOSENKO, or

other persuasive evidence to the contrary, CIA finds that the

evidence establishes a presumption that NOSENKO was dispatched

by the KGB, and believes that prudence requires that he be

regarded as still responsive to KGB control, and that his infor

mation snould be assessed accordingly. "

1. NOSENiO did not serve in tie davai RU in any of the capacities

or ai the places anci times he ciaired. (Previoua conclusion)

The above is conclusion "A" in the previous summary in regard

IC NOSENKO. The current conclusion is that tre claimed service oi

NOSENKO in Navy Inielligence (Naval RU) during March 1951 to early

1953 in the Far East and the Baltic areas is adequately substantiated

and should be accepiec.

The interrogations of NOSENKO prior to 1967 were complicated

by NOSENKO changing the date of his graduation irom the Institute of

International Reiations irom 1950 to 1949 because he dia noi wish to

admit that he had failed io graduate in 1949 with the majority of his class.

However, previous ejoris of NOSENKO to revert to his original 1962

statement that he graduaied in 1950 were not accepted and an unwarranted

significance was given to the 1949 - early 1953 period oi time.

It is considered that NOSENXO has adequately explained his

"stupid blunders" as they relate to the above and to certain other personal

matters and that his claimed service in Nary Intelligence from March

195i to early 1953 boü in the Far East and the Baltic area is fuliy

accepiabie. I is not considered necessary to comment concerning all

oi the remarks in the previous summary regarding the claimed Naval

RU service oi NOSENKO as

reilecied on pages 49-59 and remarks will,

for purposes of brevity, de limiied in scope.

The statement is made in the previous summary that "The sole

Headquarters RÜ officer NOSENKO identified was the Personnel Chicí,

Colonel KALOSHIN. He identified no ranking officers in either the Baltic

or Far East Inteligence Staffs. Some 30 GRU officers he did identily.

by his own admission, IOSENIO knew not from his Naval RÜ service,

but through social acquainiance, later, in Voscow, or through his visits

do Geneva."

Altached is a copy oi a handwritten memorandum voluntarily

prepared by NOSENKO in late 1967 containing the names ci a number

of GRU personnel of whom ie had some knowledge. The attached was

not prepared as the result of any inquiry concerning his claimed Naval

RU service, but was only a small part of the material prepared by

NOSENKO at this time. The entire material included remarks by

NOSENKO regarding approximately 875 KGB oilicers, 100 KGB agents,

35 GRÜ officers and 400 other Soviet nationals.

It is interesting to note that the altached list contains the names

oi approximaiely 20 GRU oificers whom NOSENKO relates to the cariy

1950's period. In addition, NOSENKO has, during current interviews

and in other memoranda, furnished the names of additional Navy Intelii

gence personnel whom he know in the 1951 - carly 1953 period.

Page 52 of the above summary and other related pages question

wnether NOSENXO ever served in the Baltic area wiin Naval Intelligence

and even question his geographical knowledge of the area. Attached is a

copy o' a handwritter. memorandum with certain diagrams prepared by

NOSENKO on 21 February 1968 concerning his assignment with Navy

Intelligence in the Far East and the Baitic area. The memorandum was

compieted by NCSENKO without any reierence material and a review of

his diagrams indicates they are quite accurate.

NOSENKO had previously stated that his service in the Baltic

area was at Sovetsk Primorskiy and during current interviews recailed

that the former name of the place, an aimost deserted fishermen's

village, was Fishausen. The previous designation given by NOSENKO

for this place as having the mail address of Sovetsk Primorskiy had

caused the conclusion that his alleged place of assignment was non-

existent. A further check in the matter would have disclosed that the

place was not nonexistent, that it is currently known as Primorsk and

that the former German name of the fishing village was Fischhausen.

The previous summary aiso siated that despite his claimed

B. NOSENKO did not enter the KGB in the manner or at the time

claimca.

(Previous conciusion)

The above is conclusion "B" in the previous summary in regard

i NOSENKO. The conclusion in this summary is that NOS ENKO entered

the then Second Chiei Directorate, MVD, in mid-March 1953 and that his

entry was not only facilitated by but due to the influence of General

Bogdan Zakharovich KC3JLOV.

Previous statements by NOSENKO and changes relative to date of

entry into the KGB have been mentioned in another section of the summary

and will not be repeated here.

His statements during current interviews

that he entered on duty in mid-March 1953 as a case officer in the First

Section, First Department, Second Chief Directorate, MVD, are con-

sidered adequately substantiated and should be accepted.

The conclusion of the previous summary (pages 61-74) that

NOSENKO did not enter the KGB in the manner or at the time claimed

was primarily based on conflicting statements by NOSENKO as to when

he entered the KGB (MVD). In 1962 NOSENKO said March 1953 and in

1965 NOSENKO again said March 1953, soon after the death of STALIN.

in 1964, NOSENKO had given to daies in 1952 as dis time oi entry into

the KGB in an elort not to aumit that he had failed to graduaie from the

Institute of International Relations in 1949.

The previous summary gave considerable weight io the statemente

OÍ NOSENKO indicating ihai he disi not enter the KGB (VVD) under what

are considered normal KGB procedures. Proper allowances were not

given for posicion of the fairer of NOSENKO, ine Minister oi Shipbuilding,

and the influence of General KOBULOV. An analyst can either accep. or

reject the statement of NOSENKO that he entered the KGB (MVD) through

the influence oi General KOBULOV; but, if the statement is accepted, then

the failure of NOSENKO to be required to follow normal KGä procedures

should also be accepted. A Communist society or a Soviet intelligence

organization is not and could not be immune to influence by a bigh oificial.

GErGIEl KOBULOV as of mid-Marcà 1953 was Firsi Deputy is BERIYA,

the Minister of the then MVD.

The previous summaiy raises several points concerning the

eligibility of NOSENKO for the KGB (MVD). It points out on page 67

that other than his undistinguished period of service with the Naval RU,

he was no more eligible for a KGB appointment in 1953 than he was at

the time of his previous rejection in 1950. This statement is not contro-

vertible and is fully accepted with the qualification that in 1950 NOSENKO

was not sponsored by any person of influence as was ine case in 1953

¿O BERIYA.

The previous summury also siates that according to KGB

dcícctors familiar with the siandards in iorce at the time, no cancidate

was accepted who had ever had tuberculosis. This is a flat statement

which it is doubiíul any defector or series of defectors could fully

substantiate; namely, that it never happened. Until and unless it is

medically proven that NOSENKO did not have tuberculosis, it is accepted

that he did have tuberculosis in 1952 and was at a sanitarium -- rest.

piace in Kubinka. It is also accepied that he was an ofticer in the KGB

after mid-Varch 1953. The influence of KOBULOV could undoubtedly

bave permitied NOSENKO to enter the KGB even though he previously

had tuberculosis, but the flat siatement inat no candidate was accepted who

had ever had tuberculosis is not and cannot be sufriciently substantiated.

The previous summary contained a number of additional remarks

and conclusions intended to snow that NOSENKO was not eligible for and

therefore could not have entered the KGB (MVD). Comments concerning

these wiil be brief since there is considered to be no adequate basis at

this time on which to contend that NOSENKO did not enter the KGB

(MVD) as an officer in mid-March 1953. A comment was made that

3

## Page 137

13-00000

NOSENKO did not take a physical examination in connection wit his

processing for KGB entry, and that such a medical examiration was

a routine and mancaiory part of the processing of a KGB candidate.

This staierent makes no allowance for the influence o! General

KOBULOV; but, in addition, docs not consider the faci that the Navai

Rü dossier on NOSENKO was available to the KGB (MVD).

The previous summary also failed is note that ine MVD wouid

have rad independent iniormation in regard to NOSENXO since ine MVD

would have conducied any necessary inquiry in connection with the entry

of NOSENKO into the Naval RU. As of 1953, the MVD undoubtediy also

had a dossier un the father of NOSENKO since this was still the STALIN

era.

The summary

also states that NOSENKO did noi compiete ine

necessary jengthy Anketa before entry into the KGB (MVD) and did not

speax to any personnel officers or visit the personnel olfice. It wouid

seem that the influence of General KOBULOV could have permitted the

elimination of most if not all of the necessity of complying with normal

procedures, but NOSENKO haB during interviews stated that he com-

pleted the Anketa while sitting at his desk after entry into the KGB (MVD).

Page 70 of the previous summary states that NOSENKO did not

know the designation of his own Directorate either at the time he allegedly

eniered on duiy or during his first year of KGB service. While

NOSENKO has claimed ¿hai the designation of bis Dixeciorate at the

time he entered the KGB (MVD) in mid-March i953 was the Second

Chief Directoraie ard that it subsequently was redesignated lbe

First Chiei Directorate, DERYABIN das Staled this reversal of

designations occurred in March 1953.

STALiN died in carly Varcia 1953 anc that same month the

MVD and the MCB were merged under the name MVD with BERIYA

as Minister. BERIYA held this position until his arrest in early June

195j. BERIYA was succeeded by KRUGLOV, who held office for less

than a year. Yuriy RASTVOROV was recently queried concerning the

date of the reversal of the designation of the FCD and SCD and places

it as the erd of April or early May 1953. GOLITSYN has indicated itai

the change occurred "soon after ine aúvent of SERiYA as head oi she

MVD in April 1953. " In the light of our inability to fix the electivé cate

of the reversal of the designations of the SCD and the ECD, it is

unreasonable to impugn NOSENKO on his statement as to the designation

of his Directorate at the time of his entry into the KGB (MVD).

There is a disagreement between NOSENKO and others as to who

was responsible for the reversal of designations of the FCD and the SCD.

NOSENKO is of the opinion that it occurred under KRUGLOV, which is

of desigrations, li would appear that NOSENKO is in error. rowever,

the faci irat he was à now jurior officer and that this was a period oi

uphcaval in the KGB (MVD) electively eliminates any significance in

NOSENKO is criticized in the previous summary for not knowing

the location of ine Chiel Directorate of the Militia or the nisiory of the

iSI (Committee of Iniormation). NOSENKO has stated that be had no

contacia with either oilice during 1953-1955 and there in no adequate reason

to disbelieve this statement. He is not aware of when the ki ceased to

exist (1931 giver in ine summary, but other information indicaies the il

was discussed by ar oificer from the Personnei Directory with an

official of the Firsi Department. Under other circumstances NOSENKO

would very possitly have encountered dilliculty, but, it should be noted

that the father o! NOSENKO retained his position, that NOSENKO only

met General KOBULOV through his father, and that NOSENIO bas stated

that although sis father knew General KOBULOV, his father couid in no

C. NOSPYKO did noi serve in the American Embassy Section

throughout she 1953 - 1955 perica as he claimed. (Previous conciusion)

The above is conclusion "C" in the previous summary. The

conclusion in this summary is that NOSENKO was an officer of the First

Section (American Embassy Section), First Department, from mid-Varch

1953 to late May 1955 when he was transierred to the Sevenin Department,

SCD.

This period of time has beer. covered in detail with NOSENKO

during curreni interviews. The conclusion is that NOSENKO was an

viticer in the First Section but was not a very effective officer and that

both his works and behavior were decidedly influenced by the fact thai he

was the son of the Minister of Shipbuilding. NOSENKO is rejuctant to

admi: that he was other than slightly lackadaisical in his work curing

this period of time, but is not hesitant io admi: that his persoual be-

havior was such as to cause him to be removed as Secretary to the

Komsomol unit in 1954 and to cause an unsatisfactory "characterization"

to be propared in early 1955 which necessitated a decision as io whether

he would be fired irom the KGB or transierred io some other component.

The induence of his family is quite appareni in the above sirce

• his fatber was advised of his difficulties in 195% by an oificial of the

KGB and his mother inierceded on his behalk in 1955 with the Chiei of

SCD. The result in 1955 was that NOSENIO was transferred to the

Seventh Department ard not fired from the KGB.

The question has been raised as to how NOSENKO could remain

in the KGB when after 1954 be was not a member of the Komsomol and

was not eligible to become a candidate for the Communist Farty, This

is a valid question but a plausible esplaration is again the fact that he was

the son di the then Minister of Shipbuilding.

NOSENKO has stated during previous and current interviews ii:

lollowing his entry into the KGB and until circa mid-1954 he was respon-

sible for work againsi American correspondents in Moscow. He has nos

claimed that he had any successes and has stated that the work with news-

paper correspondents already recruited was being candled by other olficers.

NOSENKO has explained that during this time he was a "new officer, "

indicating be could hardly kave been expected io act as an experienced

officer. His knowledge of correspondents in Moscow during this period

of time, together with his knowledge of other KGB officers and his

information concerning his own ajents is believed of suificient weight

to accept tne statement of NOSENKO that work against American coi-

respondents was his assignmen irom mid-Varca 1953 to mid-1554.

From circa mid-1954 until his transfer to ine Seventh Depart-

ment in late May 1955, NOSeNXO ciaims and has claimed be was an

officer of the First Section with loe responsibility of work against the

Vilitary Attaches (Army) at the United Stales Embassy in Moscow. It

is considered, based on his knowledge of she various Military Aitache

personnel and oiher coliatera; irformaiion furnished by NOSENXO, that

NOSENKO was an officer of the First Section during the mid-1954 - late

May 1955 period of time, that his primary work was against members

of the Oilice oi the Military Attache, but that the quality of his work

undoubtedly left much to be desired.

In circa mid-1954; NOSENXO was removed as Secretary of the

Komsomol unit and by early 1955 his performance was such that at least

certain officials in the First Department desired his removal from the

First Department, if not the KGB. Under these circumstances,

NOSENKO could be criticized as having been a very 200r if not

undesirable KGB officer, but his knowledge of the First Section during

this period of time and hia knowledge of the members of the Office of

the Military Aitache supporis the claim oi NOSENKO toat he was an

oilicer of the Firs; Section wiüh the indicated assignment ab related

by him.

NOSINXO has siaied that the work against the Military

Attaches was noi primarily directed toward developmeni of recruitment

possibilities, but was direcied toward control of the Military Attaches

on trips in order to prevent observation of sensitive areas, sensitive

sires or sensitive activities in the USSR. This attitude by the KGB

would appear to be compietely plausible and NOSENIO noted as

exceptional in tois regard the recruitment attempt against Captain Waiter

MULE. NOSENKO explained this exception as retaliation for approaches

to Sovieis in lae United Staïos in that period.

NOSENKO has been criticized because he did not know all the

details corcerning the Military Attaches which i: was considered he

should have known it he had the specific responsibility for work agains:

the Military Artaches during the indicated period of time, it is submitted

The effectivences or non-elfectiveness of NOSENKO during his

assignment to the First Section, First Department, from mid-Varch

1953 to late May 1955 can have little pertinency in the question of the

bona fides of NOSENKO if it is accepted that he actuaily was an oificer

in the First Section during this period of time. It is felt that incormation

The above is conclusion "D" in the previous summary. The

current conclusion is that NOSENXO was an officer in the Seventh

Department, SCD, from late May i955 to December 1959 and was

Deputy Chief of the American-British Commonwealth Section, Seventi

Department from 1958 to December 1959.

During current interviews, NOSENKO has furnished extensive

information concerning his own activities in the Seventh Department

during the 1955-1959 period. Interviews of persons who were the subject

of KGB interest collateraily confirm that NOSENKO was personally in-

volved in certain claimed activities during 1955 to December 1959.

These activities include among others the recruitment of Richard BURGI

in June 1956, contact with Sir Allen LANE and Arthur BIRSE in the

summer of 1957, the recruitment of Gisella HARRIS in 1958, the re-

cruitment of George DREW in the spring of 1959, the recruitment of

foregoing is not a complete list of all cases in which NOSENKO ciaims

Sir Allen LANE, Arthur BIRSE, William Stanley WILBY, and

David TAYLOR were British citizens and the other above-named indi-

viduals were United States citizens. This would seem to substantiate

the claim of NOSENKO that during 1955 - December 1959 he was an

officer engaged in KGB operations against American-British Common-

wealth tourists in the USSR.

in addition, NOSENKO has furnished specific information about

an operation against Viartin MALIA, an American tourist who was in

the Soviet Union from approximately September 1955 to December 1955.

VALIA has not been interviewed and will not be interviewed, so at this

time no particular 1955 case in which NOSENKO claims involvement

or personal knowledge has been substantiated by interview of the

individual involved.

NOSENKO has furnished inormation on the travel of certain

United States Governient officiais, inciuding Congregsional represent-

atives to the ÜSSR in 1955 - 195ó; and the trip oi Supreme Court Justice

William O. DOUGLAS in 1955 which, when consiscred with the previously

mentioned specifies, adequately substantiate his himed service in the

Seventh Department and work against American-British Commonwealth

tourists during ine late May 1955 - December 1959 period.

NOSENKO has stressed that when he transferred to the Seventh

Department, the Tourist Section had just been established and an agent

network was not •vailable for opcrations against American and British

tourists. This seems quite logical since the infiux of tourists into the

USSR was ju t in a iormalive stage.

NOSENKO has spoken in detail about an agent network he dc-

veloped after 1955 which primarily consisted of Intourist personnel

and two homosexual agents, "SHMELEV" and "GRIGORIY" (KGB code

names), whose extensive use in KGB operations has been confirmed by

interviews with individuais who were the subject of homosexual com-

promise operations.

pages would be repetitious and in many instances superfluous. li is

considered that even ii the statemenis were accepted in toto, there

would still no: be an adequiie basis ior a conclusion thai NOSENKO

was not an oificer in the claimed positions in the Seventh Department

during the period of late May 1955 - December 1959. Nor is it con-

ceded that, i all the sub-conclusions and the interpretations of various

areas of information were accepied without quaiification, there is any

evidence that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB. However, inere

are certain assumptions and interprctations which appeared in the

previous summary which are particularly worthy of comment and waich

are considered erroneous or require additional clarification.

On page 145 it is stated that the evidence suggests that NOSENKO

was an English-speaking specialist in sexual entrapment, not a counter-

intelligence officer responsible for the identification of foreign agenis

among tourists or for the development, recruitment, and expioitation

of agents for the KGB. The Second Chief Directorate, KGB, and the

MVD have used homosexual and heterosexual compromise in numerous

known (and presumably unknown) successiul recruitments and recruit-

ment attempts.

This activity has noi been limited to the Seventh Depart-

ment, SCD; and the innuerdo that Y'OSENKO was "only an English -

speaking specialist in sexual entrapment" and not a KGB gaUdiEden

Sevenin Departineni persoirel, activities, procedures, and topica of

a similar tature is not considered to have any ioundation in fact.

Page 145 oi the above surnmary lists eleven operations which

were Seventh Depariment Cases prior to 1960 and which were included

in the notes furnished to CIA in 1964 by NOSENKO. The named operations

were those against Berrard PECHTER, Patrick PRESSMAN, John RUFE.

Gerald SEVERN, Sofia SHATTAUER, (inu) KARLOV, Norman FISK,

Ralph MATLAW, Varvin KAVIOR, Michael GINSBURG, and William

TARASKA. The criticism made in regard to the above eleven cases

was that NOSENKO could not describe the individual operations other

than to say that he had recorded the name of the larget and such details

as he could acquire when he reviewed the activities of the Seventh Depart-

ment in 1962 following his return from the Firet Department.

The notes brought out by NOSENTO are considered in another

section of this summary, but it should be noted here that a full review

of all of the notes oi NOSENKO currently availabie indicates that his

statements as to how and why he obtained the information in the notes

are completely piausible.

A detailed explanation of the notes furnished

by NOSENKO would almost necessitate a separate listing of ine approxi-

mately 150 cases or names mentioned in the notes.

During curreni interviews, NOSENKO furnished specific

indormation on certain of the above eleven cases, including William

TARASKA, Bernara PECHTER, Michaei GINSBURG and John RUFE.

I shouid aiso be noied that certain of the cases such as Marvin KANTOR

and William TARASKA were cases in which the tourist was visiting

reiatives in the Soviet Union and that NOSENKO has giver a satisiactory

expianation oi how he earned oi the KANTOR case. NOSENKO has, in

discussing his duties as Depuy Chief oi the American-British Common-

wealth Section, aiso explained that il a tourist indicated that he intended

to visit relatives in the USS:, the case automatically was assigned to a

group o officers in the Section who reported directiy to the Chief of

Section and were not under the supervision of NOSENKO.

NOSENKO has stated that he noted the names of three oi the

individuals when retiring the files oi "GRIGORIY" and "SHMELEV, "

two homosexual agents of NOSENKO previously mentioned. NOSENKO

has expiained that "SHIMELEV" and "GRIGORIY" had the assignment of

identifying American travelers with homosexual tendencies, that they

had contact with numerous Americans, and that they had homosexual

activity with individuals on whom they reported but on whom no overt

action was taken by the Seventh Department. In some cases the individual

was not considered a worihwhile target and in others the iníormation

was just maintained for possible use at a later date if the individual

returned to the USSR.

NOSENKO has aiso expiained how he learned of the Patrick

• PRESSMAN and Gerald SEVER cases; and, the listing oi the Sofia

SHATTAUER case in connection with the 1955 - 1959 period is in com-

plete error since page 427 of the previous summary contains information

from NOSENKO on her recruitment in 1962. During current interviewe

the notes which NOSENKO brought out in 1964 have been discussed in

detail with NOSENKO. He has given a detailed explanation of the material

which he brought out and his explanation of all aspects is very convincing.

The previous summary (page 144) suggested that the involvement

•i NOSENKO in certain cases being handled by other Sections in the

Seventh Department or by ihe KGB Directorate oi Muscow was, unusual.

An examination of the cited cases does not indicate that his participation

was unusual, but rather that his explanation of why he was involved is

logical and normal. No consideration was previously given to the English

language capability of NOSENKO or the fact that his own homosexual agents

were used in two of the four cited cases.

The summary also noted that there was a question concerning

whether Gisella HARRIS was necessarily a Seventh Department case.

This question seems quite superfluous since HAzit was in the USSR

on a tourist visa and "scal" tourists are the responsibility of the Seventi

Depariment. Departinental rcoponsibility within the SCD for an indi

vicual traveling in the USSR is decided or the basis of how the indivicual

is traveling: i. e., whetner on à tourisi visa, as a member of a deiogation.

as the invitee of an organization in the CSSR, as a former diplomat

stationed in Voscow, as a dipiomat not previously stationed in Moscow,

as a member of ine Cuitural Exchange program, as a student attending

a university in the USSR, etc. There are also various other factors

which affect the determination of which Department or organizational

component of the SCD has the responsibility for a tourist case. These

factors include whether the individual is already suspected of foreign

intelligence connections and whether the individual is a businessman.

In addition, certain actual tourists in the USSR may never become the

responsibility oi the SCD if tre individual is of specific interest to the

FCD.

On pages 148 - 149, NOSENKO is criticized for not knowing at

least some of the substance of the information furnished by George

BLAKE in regard to the CIA-MI-6 program of utilizing tourist agents

in the USSR. This criticism compleiely ignored the fact that NOSENKO

made several references in 1962 to the KGB having such information

althouga he did then and still suspects thai William VASSALL was the

source. The relerences by NOSENKO to the KGB having such inior-

mation were not developed in 1962 or later interrogations, ard it was

not until current interviews that it was established that NOSENTO had

actually seen excerpts of incormation passe by George BLAKE.

According to NOSENKO, the incormation which was coviousy only

partial was furnished to the ICD by the SCS and could oniy kave come

from an agent

The previous summary (page 149) also notes that in 1961 CIA

acquired a lengthy Top Secret study on the subject of the use of tourists

by American Intelligence for espionage and operational support in the

Soviet Union (document was iurnished by GOLITSYN following his de-

fection in December 1901). it was noied that the summary contained

"references to certain 1958 - 1959 tourists whom the KGB counter -

intelligence identified as Amirican agents and noted that NOSENKO

claimed he was Deputy Chief oi the American-British Commonwealth

Section in this period of time and that he claimed the KGB identified

no American Intelligence agenis during this period of time. What later

is described as a claim by NOSENKO is reither an accurate reflection

o what NOSENKO said prior to 1967 or has said since 196%.

actig suspiciously irom a KGB point of view.

NOSENKO has stated he was aware that a document which the

Seventh Department had prepared and iurnished to the FCD in an effort

to obtain further assistance from the FCD in ine work against tourists

nad been compromised by GOLITSYN. NOSENKO stated he was not in

the Seventh Department when the document was prepared and did not

document rad been compromised. The document furnished by GOLITSYN

has never been reviewed with NOSENKO to determine if it contained

additional information not in the document which he was aware had

been prepared by the Seventh Department for the FCD.

that the kaoniedge Of NOSENKO regarding XG3 activity

F. NOSENKO's claims, that in 1962 he was Chief of the

American-British Commonwealth Secsion and was hereafier a

Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department, are not crediole. (Previous

conclusion)

The conclusion of this summary is that NOSENKO was Chief

of the American-British Commonwealth Section (First Section) from

January 1962 to July 1962 and that he was a Deputy Chief of the Seventh

Department tbereafter.

NOSENKO has stated that, although he was offered the position

of a Deputy Chiei of the First Department, SCD, by Oleg M. CRIBANOV,

Chief, SCD, and although an order had been prepared and was in the

Personnel Directorate, be declined the profered position.

According to NOSENKO, he knew that Sergey Mikhaglovich

FEDOSEYEV, the Chief of the First Department, did not want NOSENKO

as a Deputy Chief, but instead wanted to promoie Vladislav KOVSHUK,

then Chief of the First Section, to the position. FEDOSEYEV was

willing to promote, NOSEYKO to the position of Chief, First Section.

However, GRIBANOV did not wish to promote KOVSHUK and NOSENKO

considered inat under the circumstances it would be better for him to

return to the Seventh Department rather than to become a Deputy to

FEDOSEY EV who wanted KOVSriüKas a Deputy,

Vladimir Dmitriyevich CHELNOKOV had offered NOS ENKO the

position of Chief of the First Section, Seventh Department, pending the

reassignment of BALDIN to Germany at which time NOSENKO would

become a Deputy Chief, Seventh Department, replacing BALDIN. The

above explanation of NOSENKO seems plausible and credible and indi-

cates that GRIBANOV, the Chief of the SCD, for reasons best known to

GRIBANOV, was assisting NOSENKO in his career in the KGB.

This section actually covers two periods in the claimed career

pí NOSENKO; namely, January - July 1962 as Chief of the First Section,

and July 1962 - January 1964 as a Deputy Chief of the Seventh Depart-

ment. Since NOSENKO was in Geneva, Switzerland, from March to

June 1962, he actually cannot be seriously faulted for not having de-

tailed knowledge of the activities of the First Section during January -

July 1962. The previous summary (pages 268 - 291) contains remarke

in regard to the January - July 1962 period, including the period oi

March - June 1962 when he was in Geneva. Four specific tourist cases

are discussed in the previous summary: the cases of Wallace Everett

JOHNSON, William Carroll JONES, Natalie BIENSTOCK, and Horst

BRAUNS. Apparent conlicts between information from NOSENKO and

information derived from subsequent interviews with these individuals

were cited as evidence impugning NOSENKO. It is not believed that the

previous comments concerning these cases constitute any substantial

evidence that NOSENKO did not hoid the claimed position of Chief oi the

First Section, Seventh Department, during January - July 1962. That

there were KGB operations against JOHNSON, JONES, BIENSTOCK and

BRAUNS has been confirmed through interviews by the FBI of all iour

individuals.

A few additional remarks in regard to the above four cases are

warranted, not because it is considered that there are any substantial

discrepancies between wizat NOSENKO has said and what each individual

stated when interviewed, but because they may provide additional clari-

fication.

In the Wallace Everett JOHNSON case, it was previously noted

that JOHNSON arrived in Moscow on 31 December 1961 and that the KGB

operation against him occurred on 5 January 1962. The summary sug-

gested that the short lapse of time indicated that the homosexual tend

encies of JOHNSON were known to the KGB prior to his arrival, contrary

to the statements of NOSENKO. NOSENKO during current zagview

SECRET

## Page 223

13-00000

has stated that the KGB learea of the homoscrual tendencies oi JOHNSON

"by chance" soon after his arrivai. "STiVELEY" and "GRIGORIY, "two

homosexual agenis of NOSENKO, were at the time operating out oi a room

at the Metropol Hotei where jOHNSON stayed. They met ICHSON there

and reported his apparent homosexual tendencies.

In regari to the William Carrol JONES case, NOSENKO during

current interviews has furnished additional information on the KGB operation

against JONES, including the woman iudmila BUGAY EVA who was recruiied

as an agent to work against JONES and was used in another case. The other

details furnished by NOSENKO concerning the JONES case are compatibie

with his claim to having been Chief of the First Section, Severth Department.

In regard to the Nataie BIENSTOCK case, NOSENKO did ros claim

to have been the responsible case officer but was abie to provide erough

specilic informaiion concerning the case to bring about a cosiession when

she was interviewed by the FBI. That he did noi know all ice cetails con-

cerning the BIENSTOCK case could be explained by his claim to have been

Chief of Section and not the case oificer directly invoived with the case.

In regard to the Horst BRAUN'S case, in the previous summary

the criticism was levied that NOSENKO did not know why BRAUN'S visited

the USSR and was not able to identify any Soviet citizens whom BRAUNS

met in the USSR. It was also stated that NOSENKO had explained that

0001221

SECRET

## Page 224

13-00000

the Seventb Depariment was noi concerned with oreigners visiting

relasives in the ESSR nor with Soviet expatriates. NOSENKO, accord-

ing to the previoss summary, was aware that BRAUNS was a former

Sovie: citizen and ide summary siated lat his plan to visit relatives

was iniormation available to the KGB rough kis visa application.

In regará to the staiemen: that toe Sevenih Depäriment was not

concerned with foreigners visiting relatives in zoe USSR nor with Soviet

expatriates, this is not in agreement with current information from

NOSENKO, * Cases of "true" tourists, which were normally the respon

sibility of the Seventh Department, could become the responsibility of

another department or KGB component where Soviet relatives were

involved. However, if the case was not taker over or assigned by higher

authority to anoicer department or component, it was and remained the

responsibility of the Seventa Department. The faci that BRAUNS was a

former Soviet citizen

could very well have made BRAUNS of interest to

the Second Section, First Deparimeni, or a direction in dae Service of

the SCD. However, in the absence of an actual reassignment by higher

authority, the case would remain the responsibility of the Sevents Depart

ment since BRAINS was visiting the Soviet Union on a tourist visa. The

previous summary also indicated that BRAUNS listed on his visa appli-

cation that he planned to visit relatives in Leningrad. BRAUNS had a

relative or relatives in Leningrad. Although BRAUNS, when interviewed by

the FBI, mertioned a number of items oi which the KGB was aware concern-

ing his background and occupation irom his visa application, there is no

specific reierence in these interviews indicating his statement of purpose

in visiting ine SSR.

Pages 282 - 28ó of the previous summary revicws remarks by

NOSENKO on the Boris BELITSKIY case and states that his claimed role

in the case was not plausible. There are several accific points made in

the summary which imply that NOSENKO was lying about his knowledge of

the case. Taere is adequate reason to believe thai NOSENKO exaggerated

his own 1962 role in that NOSENKO now states he was to give assistance

10 Vladimir Lvovich ARTEMOV in the handling of BELITSKIY in Geneva

in 1962 and rot to supervise ARTEMOV.

The more important aspect and the primary one is the difference in

what NOSENKO specifically reported about the BELITSKIY case and inior-

mation from the actual CiA record of the case. There are major dilier-

ences and without going into all the details of the case which is very involved,

an effort has been made toward determining whether these apparent differ-

ences necessarily indicate that NOSENKO was or is lying or whether there

is a possibility he is relating the actual KGB version of the case.

NOSINKO has stated that BELITSKIY was a KGB agent whom

American intelligence recruited in London in 1960 or 1961 and that the

0001223

6

SEGRET

---

## Page 226

13-00000

KGB purpose in running the operation was to lure American Intelligence

into meeting BELITSKIY inside he USSR. The previous summary stated

that NOSENKO did no: know when the BELITSki: oporation started

(Brussels, Belgium, 1958), did not know the nature of the British

involvement, did n:t know the operational details and contact arrange-

ments BELITSKIY had with CIA, ard did not know BELITSKIY's paitern

of activity in Moscow or Geneva.

NOSENKO during current interviews has indicated an awareness

that the KGB (Second Section, First Department) had been trying to use

BELITSKIY against the British. However, he still has dated the recruit-

ment of BELITSKIY as 1960-1961 in Loadon and still states that the

primary purpose of the KGB was to involve American Intelligence in

contacts with BELITSKIY within ine USSR. The latter was considered

• completely inconsistent with the fact that BELITSKIY was recruited in

Brussels, Belgium, in 1958; that three letters bad been mailed to

BELITSKIY in the USSR in 1959 and early 1960; and that BELITSKIY

had an accommodation address for contact outside the USSR.

There are at this time sufficient unresolved questions in the

BELITSKIY case to preclude any conclusion that the apparent dis

crepancies between the statements by NOSENKO on the BELITSKIY

case and the actual record are a reflection against NOSENKO U0l1 224

-SECRET

## Page 227

13-00000

toe other band, there is some reason to believe NOSENKO bas

furnished the actual KGB version of the BELITSKIY case and that the

KGB, at least as of 1962, did not know the true story of the relation-

ship of BELITSKIY with CIA. There is a distinct possibility the

KGB believed the SEMITSKIY recruitment occurred in 1961 in London

and BELITSKIY did not then nor has be since admitted to the KGB

is association with CIA actually started in 1958 in Brussels, Belgium.

As a possible reason why BELITSKIY would have told the KGB in

1961 a partial story of his contact with American Intelligence, some

at present unknown event may have occurred in 1961 which caused

BELITSKIY to believe his security was endangered and as a result

he told the KGB of certain events in Loadon in 1961, relating these

events as being

, the original approach to BELITSKIY by CIA.

The following are certain of the points which suggest the KGB

actually considered that BELITSKIY was recruited by CIA in London

in 1961 and that BELITSKIY may have never told the KGB of the

developments in his case prior to 1961:

(a) BELITSKIY was in London in April 1960 at which

time he was in contact with a British citizen who was also

reporting to MI-5. This individual reported information

received from BELITSKIY which may have been a lead to

6001225

## Page 228

13-00000

George BLAKE. (It scems highly undikely the KGB would

ever have directed BELITSKIY to iurnish information which

may have been a lead to George BLiKE, or at least could

have caused the employees of the knit in which BLAKE was

employed from June 1959 io August 1900 to come under

suspicion as having passed information to Soviet Intelligence.)

(b) NOSENKO has staied that BELTSKIY, aiter he went

to Geneva in 1962, managed to reinitiate contact with CIA

rather quickly because he met a girl he had previously known

whom he was sure was an American Intelligence agent and

that she must have reported his presence in Geneva to American

Intelligence. (li the BELITSiIY case had been controlled by the

KGB from its inception in 1958, the KGB would have known of

the internal mailings to BELITSKIY and the fact that BELITSKIY

had a cover aidress outside the Soviet Union through which to

initiate contact. However, if BELITSKIY did not tell the KGB

anything about his contacts with CIA prior to 1961 and then

gave only a partial story of what happened in London in 1961,

BELIISKIY would not have told the KGB of the internal mail-

ings to BELITSKIY in the USSR or the fact that he long had

a cover address outside the USSR. BELITSKIY therefore

As previously indicated, the conclusion is there are a sufficient

number of unresoived questions in the BELITSKIY case so that discrep-

ancies between information i:om NOSENKO and the actual record in the

BELITSKIY Case cannot at present be considered as a reilection against

YOSENKO, and there is a distinct possibility the KGB actually did not

know the true facts of the BELITSKIY case.

The previous summary nored on page 106 that Nataliya SHULGINA

was an Intourist interpreter recruited by NOSENKO in 1955. It also

noted that NOSENKO had stated Boris BELITSKIY "reported to the KGB

that CIA had warned BELITSKIY against SHULGIVA." The previous

summary stated BELITSKIY reported to CIA that SHULGINA was a KGB

agent and "CIk did not warn BELITSKIY."

There appears to be no doubt at this time that the statement by

NOSENKO that BELITSKIY reported the "CIA had warned BELITSKIY

against SHULGINA, " is a rcasonably accurate description of what actualy

happened in May 1962 during Agency contacts with BELITSKIY in Geneva.

The record reflects that BELITSKIY stated SHULGINA had confidentially

told him of her status as a KGB agent, stating she had been doubled by

the KGB after having been forcibly recruited by American Intelligence

whik previously in Paris, France.

6001228

11

-SECRET

## Page 231

13-00000

it was determined there was no collateral imormation which

would indicate that the statement by SHULGINA had any factual basis

and BELITSKIY was warned SHULGINA may have been acting on behaif

of the KGB in stating to BELITSKIY she had been "iorcibly recruited by

American Inteiligence" at a previous date. It was also suggested to

BELITSKIY that he should go to the KGB as a loyal Soviet citizen and

report the apparent indiscretion of SHULGiNA.

Pages 282 - 286 of the previous summary, in connection with

the BELITSKIY case, made reference to Vladimir Lvovich ARTEMOV.

It was stated that ARTEVOV had been involved with a series of America.

tourist agents in the Soviet Union and although NOSENKO was allegedly

familiar with ARTEMOV, he was unaware of the involvement of ARTEMOV

with American tourist agents in 1958 - 1959. The summary noted this

-was during a period when NOSENKO claimed to have been Deputy Chief

of the American-British Commonwealth Section of the Seventh Depart-

ment. Although not specificaily stated, the above suggested ARTEMOV

was actually in the Seventh Department in 1958 - 1959 and that NOSENKO

was not even aware ARTEMOV was in the Seventh Department. NOSENKO

has consistently stated that ARTEMOV was assigned to the First Section,

First Department, from the time he entered into the KGB in approxi-

mately 1957.

A closer examination of the cases described in the previous

summary. as "CiA American tourist agents, " revcale there is no con-

flict in the invoivement of ARTEMOV in these cases and ine statement

by NOSENKO that ARTEMOV was with the First Section, First Depart-

ment.

As an example, ore of the cases is the case of Edward McGOWAN.

NOSENXO has furnishica irformation concerning this case, stating it was

originally a Seventh Department case and that after the mailing of a leiter

by the individual in Minsk, the case was immediately taken over by the

First Department. There is adequate reason to believe ARTEMOV only

became involved after the case was transferred to the First Department.

Another of the cases involved the contact of ARTEMOV with L

and visited the USSR on a tourist visa.

Such an individua: would under

no circumstances be considered a true tourist or the responsibility of

the Seventh Depariment, particularly since apparently the individual was

even traveling under a diplomatic passport. it is, assumed the individual

was oi interest to the First Chief Directoraie and if the First Chief

Directorate required or desired support from ine SCD, it would normally

request the First Department for such assistance and it is extremely ur-

likely that the FCD would request ine Seventh Department ior assistance

Pages 332 - 333 of the previous summary contain the basis

¡or the previous conclusion thai the claim of NOSENIO that he was a

Deputy Chiei oi the Sevents Departinent from July 1962 to January

1963 was not crecible. It is considered that a detailed rebuttal is

not necessity since this conclusion was apparently based on inadegudie

information. During current interviews, NOSENKO bas furnished

details concerning his duties and other aspects of his claimed position

which substantiate his claim, to having been a Deputy Chief of the

Seventà Depariment from July 1962 to January 1964.

1n example in support of the staiement that the previous conclu

sion was based on inadequate information is the matter of the written

soies which NOSENKO brought out and furnished to CIA in early 196s.

The description of these notes on page 319 of the previous summary is

inadeguate, inaccurate, and misleading. Prior to current interviews,

an effort had not been made to obiain from NOSENKO a detailed expian-

ation of his notes or of boiv he obtained the information in the notes.

During current interviews, NOSENKO has given detailed iniorma-

tion concerning all aspects of his notes. This information supports his

claimed position of Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department and includes

collateral support to bis claim of being Deputy Chief of the First Section,

First Department, in 1960 - 1961.

Primarily the notes di NOSENKO can be categorized as

follows:

• (a) Snori case sunmaries by the Chicfs of the

First Seciion, Second Section and Sixth Section, Seventa

Depärtment. NOSENKO has siied that he was in 1962 -

1963 responsidie for supervision over these Sections and

that Filip Denisovich BOBKOY, Depuiy Chiei, SCD, Who

supervised the Seventh Depariment, requested a list oi all

recruited agents of the Seventh Department. According to

NOSENKO, the order irom BOBIOV was to only retain the

files (cases) of agents in tourisi firme and that the files of

other recruited ageris should be sent to the FCD or Archives.

NOSENKO has stated that ne in turn levied on the Chieis of

the inree Sections the reguirement of BOBKOV, but aiso ex-

panded the request to include ail 1960 - 1962 cases, nos

excluding previous cases or cases which had already been

given to the FCD. The notes of NOSENKO included hand-

written reports from the Ciries or Acting Chief of caci Section

on recruited agents, with information varying from agent to

agent and even including some human errors.

Many of the above cases had previously been trans

ferred to the FCD, but the remarks of NOSENKO aboli thejf0U1232

15

## Page 235

inclusion support his statement that he had expanded

the original request irom BOBKOV so that he would have

some "pieces of information lo give ClA. "

(b) Notes by NOSENKO on other cases waich he learned

of during the 1962 - 1963 period. Certain of the notes were

made from a review of a notebook kept by the Chief, Severin

Department, to which NOSENKO had access on at least two

occasions. Most of his notes were not detailed but were

sufficient to refresh the memory of NOSENKO at a later

date and yet were somewhat innocuous to maintain before

his defection.

(c) Notes for lectures to oificers of the Seventh Directorate

prepared while with the First Department, 1960 - 1961, and

the Seventh Department, 1962 - 1763.

(d) Drait report for the briefing of the new Chief, First

Department, in the latter part of 1961.

(e) One of three copies of an unregistered report pre-

pared by the Chief, Seventh Department, and two Deputy Chiefs,

including NOSENKO. This was a briefing paper for use by the

Chief (CHELNOKOV) in an appearance beiore the Collegium

of the KGB which was reviewing the activitieu of the Seventh

Drpartment. According to NOSENKO, the prepared

report was never ¿yped as a jormal document.

The view has beca set forth that NOSENKO took undue risk in

carrying written notes with him out vi the Soviet Union. An examination

of this material suggests nat NOSEYKO was using extreme care in

collecting material and was not attempting to obtain documents, the

possession of which might be incriminating or which if he had brought

out would have been immediately missed. Instead, he collected a con-

siderable amount of valuable information which he could bring out with

little or no fear that a search of his effects in the KGB aiter his depart-

ure for Geneva would disclose that certain material was missing. None

of the material was registered and all could have previously been des-

troyed by NOSENKo.

The previous summary stated that NOSENKO brought three KGB

documents to Geneva. These were typed papers but none was registered

or actually accountable. The reference to three documents was to:

(a) The draft report for the bricfing of the Colegium

which has been mentioned previously.

(b) A typed two-page report on several cases. Actually

a Chief of Section had typed his notes on cases instead of

submitting in handwriting as the others did.

(c) A second copy of a summary on a KGB agent.

NOSENKO stated that there were two copies in the iile

kept by the Chef which he reviewed and that he kept one.

Of interest is the lact that the copy was not a registered

documeni and did not contain the usual iniormation as to

number oi copies typed.

G. NOSENiO: 25 no valici claim to certainty that the KGB

recruited no American Embassy personnel between 1953 and his

defection in 196%. (Previous conclusion)

The concision in this summary is that NOSENKO is oi the

orizion that there were no iG3 recruitmenis o linited States Embassy

personnel in Moscow beiween 1953 and December 1963 with the excoption

Of "ANDREY" (Dayle Wailis SMITH) and Herbert'FiOWARD, who actually

was a 29 employee bus did work part of the time in the Embassy.

The question here is whether or not the expressed opinion of

NOSENKO is sufficiently based on actual krowledge so that this opinion

can be accepied as absolute evilence that there were no other KGB

recruitments of Embassy personnel during this period of time. The

only logical conclusion is that tac opinion of NOSENKO cannot be

accepted as absolute fact and, therefore, there is a possibility that

a recruitment could have occurred and NOSENKO not be aware in any

way of the recruitment. This spould in no way be interpreted as a

suggestion that NOSENXO could be lying, but rather that an unbiased

observer without personal knowledge could and should be hesitant to

accept the expressed opinion of NOSENKO in this particular area.

The actual basis for the stated opinion of NOSENKO bould be

examined and can be cited as follows.

(a) During Marco 1953 -laie May 1955 NOSENKO

was a case oilicer in ine Firsi Secion, First Department,

SCD. NOSENZO does no: claim thai he would tave known

the details concerning any recruitments (otber than

"ANDREY") in this period, but staies if there nad been

he would have beard "something. "

(0) During late May 1955 to December 1959 NOSENKO

was in the Seventh Department, not the First Department,

but continued to have contact with certain officers in the

First Section, First Depariment. NOSENKO is of the

opinion that if there had been a recruitment in the United

States Embassy during this period he would have heard

"something" even thouga he would probably have learned

few details.

(c) During the January 1960-December 1961 period

NOSENÃO was Deputy Chiei of the Firet Section, First

Deparimen:, and he has made the categorical statement

thai there were no recruitments by the KGB of United

States Embassy personnel during this period of time.

He has also stated that if there bad been any recruitments

during the 1953-1959 period he is sure he would, during

1960-1961, have heard or learned some details of 404)01239

case or cases.

There is merit to this contention by

NOSENKO since the Chief oi Section was Vladislav

KOVSHUK wno had been an officer of the First Depart-

meni since 1953, actually working in the First Section

excepi ior tie periods of time that he was in the ünited

States to reactivaie "ANDREY" in 1957-1958 and a

period of time that he was Deputy Chief of the First

Department

(d) During 1962-1963 NOSENKO was again in the

Seventà Department. However, he continued to maintain

contact with certain officers of the First Section, First

Department: in particular, Gennadiy I. GRYAZNOV,

who succeeded NOSENKO as Deputy Chief of the First

Section, then became Chief of Section, and in the latter

part of 1963 became a Deputy Chief of the First Department.

According to NOSENKO his relationship with

GRYAZNOV was sufficienily close during 1962-1963 that

he is sure GRYAZNOV would have furnished NOSENKO

some iniormation in regard to any successful recruitments

of United States Embassy personnel. NOSENKO pointed

out that he learned of the existence of the Herbert HOWARD

case from GRYAZNOV in 1962, although it was not until

1963 that NOSENKO heard the name.

NOSENKO actually

FECRET

learned of tbe namo when the Firet Sectlos, First

Departnent, needed the services of the Seventh

Department (Third Section) ia obtaining a room r z

certata hotel for the Soviet girl friend of HOWARD.

In gonoral the above constitutes the basis for the stated opinion

Of NOSENKO that "ANDREY" and Herbert HOWARD were the only

successful KGB recrultmente during 1953 - December 1963.

It should

be noted chat there are no other Identified IGB recruitmente during

this pertod of time which would spectfically relute the opinlon of

NOSENKO. However, in vlew nê the citod actual baste for the opinion

of NOSENKO, acceptance of the opiulon of NOSENKO as being an

honest opiaton should no: be couverted into & statement that it le

absolute proof that another recruftment could not have occurred.

NOSENIO may be completely correct in hie opinion, but dince

NOSENKO was only in the Firat Department 1953 - 1955 and 1960 - 1961

his opinion that he would have heard "something" about a recruitinent

1m 1955 - 1959 or 1962 - 1963 Cannot be accepted as infallible.
