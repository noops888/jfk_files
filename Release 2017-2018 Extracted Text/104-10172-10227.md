NOY AS THOUGH THINGS WILL QUIST DOWN. THE PRESS SUNDAY DID

COYMEST STELEGRAPH, ESPECIALLY, OF ALL PAPERS) ON WHAT

CURIOUS ACTION THE GOVT TOOK IN SLAPPING ON THE D NOTICE.

THE EXPRESS TYPICALLY HAD A MAJOR ARTICLE STATING WHOLE

AFFAIR WAS FURTHER ATTEMPT BY CERTAIN (UNIDENTIFISD) HIGH

LEVEL U.S. OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON® TO PROMOTE RUMORS THAT

AELADLE DISCLOSURES WILL LEAD TO EVEN WORSE BRITISH SPY SCANDALS

AND ARTICLE THEN IN RETALIATION RECITES U.S. SECURITY FAILURES

FROM ROSENBERGS THROUGH MARTIN AND MITCHELL.

S. DAILY HERALD 15 JULY CARRIES STORY THAT "AMERICANS
