Again in furtherance of FBI investigation, T-2°,

in May,

1951, commented that the relationship between

GLASSER and U. S. Commissioner THEODOREXHOCKE is very CALIF

friendly, although this source had no information to

Indicate GLASSER asserts any influence over the Commissioner.

T-2l, a disgruntled former federal employee,

in May, 1901, spoke of frequent parties which he maintainec

are held in the Federal press room during the noon hour

and after 5:00 p.m. He said alcoholic beverages and

food are available, and that often poker games are played

on these occasions. Present almost every day, he said,

are GLASSER, U: S.

Commissioner HOCKE and the newsmen

assigned to the Federal beat, and an assortment of

practicing attorney$, including well known MORRIS/LAVINE.

GLASSER allegedly picks up

the tab for the cost of these

parties.

GLASSER has always operated through "connections,"

according to T-22, a Civic Center figure who has known

GLASSER for years.'

This source could not name any present

¡connections of GLASSER but recalls unverifiable rumors

in past years that GLASSER has had connections in the

office of the U.

S. Marshal, the Los Angeles County

Sheriff's Department,

the Los Angeles District Attorney's

office and the Los Angeles Police Department, all in a

position to supply him with the names of persons arrested

and booked.

This man believes GLASSER 1s. the only bail

bondsman with the capability of seeking out Commissioner

HOCKE at his residence at night to sign a release

or to set a bail.

He knows GLASSER to be extremely, close

and.'

friendly with Commissioner HOCKE, and he has observed

them together on numerous occasions in restaurants and

public places.

He knows if no gratuities furnished by

GLASSER to the Commissioner.

Still another source who commented on this

situation. 1s I-23, formerly in the bail bond business.

According to him,

GLASSER and U. S. Commissioner HOCKE

work closely together, and GLASSER has several times been

observed visiting at GLASSER's residence socially.

They

have been seen together at lunch on numerous occasions.

offered this information. as his biggest reason to think

that there is no "organization," "syndicate," "major
