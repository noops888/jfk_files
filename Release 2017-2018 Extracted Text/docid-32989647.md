A second confidential source of the Milwaukee Office,

who has furnished reliable information in the past, furnished

the following information on April 30, 1969:

On March 27, 1969, he determined that the Dominican

College, Racine,

Wisconsin, was sponsoring a program this

evening to be held at Breakers Building, and that the program

was to spotlight Negro culture. It was noted that at the

parking lot around Breakers Building were parked numerous

vehicles bearing Illinois and Wisconsin License plates.

The program was attended by an undetermined number

of students, most of whom were young whites, men and women.

Many appeared to be "hippies," and there were several who

appeared to be part of the staff at the College. An unidentified

Negro female took charge of the program, and she announced

that the program would entail a short skit to show the Negro

image as it had been in the past and then a talk and a discussion

would be presented by Chicago Black. Panther members to show the

present day Negro status.

The skit was a highly. emotional

two-part presentation depicting the slave factions on the

plantation and the beating of a colored girl. with a leather

strap by a white slave master.

Much reference was made to

"Niggers" and to "Dirty Niggers." Much hysterical praying

and crying was done by the sole Negro female participant in

the play.

movie depicted various riot situations, but the sounds being

made by participants were largely inaudible. Nevertheless,

various distinct statements were made by people in the film

in reference to what was being done to a Negro femade.

They

said she was beaten in the head by a policeman and then someone

said that a Negro male had been shot in the back by a policeman.

He stated Racine is Isolated from Chicago by

distance, but that the members of Chicago Black Panthers

had come to help them organize at Racine. He then introduced

the Secretary of the BPP, a Negro female, whose name source

could not recall, who discussed the meaning of the aforementioned

film.

She was then responsible for showing a second film

which depicted the ten point program of the Black Panthers.

She expressed to the crowd a displeasure with them because

she heard some snickering regarding some of the points depicted

in this film, particularly the points that all Negroes should

be freed from prisons at once, no matter the crime, and that

they should all be draft exempt.

The source indicated that during the sheach by

the Security Chief of the Black Panthers, he welcomed all

the students to the meeting us well as "all the FBI, CIA,

it is known today, came into being at a founding convention

held at Port Huron, Michigan, in June, 1962.

The SDS is an

association of young people on the left and has a current

program of protesting the draft, promoting a campaign for

youth to develop a conscientious objector status, denouncing

United States Intervention in the war im Vietnam and to

"radically transform" the university community and provide

for its complete control by students. GUS HALL, General

Secretary, Communist Party, USA, when imterviewed by a

representative of United Press International in San Francisco,

California, on May 14, 1965, described the SDS as a part of

the "responsible left", which the Partyihas "going

for us."

At Ene june, 1905, ODÓ Mational Coarantdon, an EntA

communist

• proviso was

removed from the sDs constluution. In the

October 7, 1966, 'issue of

"New Left Notes," the official

some

communists in SDS and they are welcome.

The following.

two articles by RUFUS WALLS,

who is the Minister of Information, Chicago Chapter

BPP, appeared in the first spring semester edition

of the "Phoenix"

underground-type newspaper

published by Negro militants at Crane Junior College,

2250 West Van Buren, Chicago, Illinois. The newspaper

was distributed on Crane campus on February 12, 1969.

"BLACK CAPITALISM

"First, we must understand the true term used for

Capitalism.

It denotes the economic system set up by.

Flanders in the 13th century and Florence in the 14th

century which

mainly was long distance trading. Their

histories shed light

the conditions as developed

by the total Western World. The English woolen in~

dustry really spearheaded Capitalism as a social and

economic system

for private profit until it became the

roots of all evils.

The selfish owners expanded

their means of production hy creating civil wars,

murdering. and raping

Asia, Africa, Latin America

and

even their own motherland while America assisted

in

the most barbaric acts ever perpetrated by man!

"Under Capitalism, all decisions concerning pro-

duction and who will get the profit is always made

by the rich (sic) In America, it is a handful of

White Anglo-Saxons (JOHNSONS,

KENNEDYS, ROCKEFELLERS,

and a few more) who are making decisions for all ethnic

groups. Under Capitalism,

the working class. (95%)

have no choice but to sell their energy or better yet

their backs for token economic gains.

In order to be

a Capitalist, one must have capital

and Black People

have no capital nor own any means of production.

He are a Capitalist people!

We are a landless people!

He are the poorest of the poor! Why are we in this

bag? Historically the Black colony was created for

the purpose of super-exploitation. Being a product

of the system--a system that enslaved our forefather-a

system

that burned Black people alive, lynched and

- 6 -

HH 55178 Do0Id:32989647 Page 52

## Page 53

crushed pregnant Black women. to death. A system that

keeps us on a reservation and the bureaucrats wha

uphold and perpetuate this system don't give a

damn if bread is on the reservation or not! What is

ironic when we try

to get off the reservation, they

think they are justified in killing us..

"If Black people or a handful in essence--one

in avery ten thousand should be given franchises to

set up a monstrous machine in the Black colony it

would

be a counterpart to the tyrannical white Anglo

Saxon's. Who would they exploit!

while the pig (sic) NIXON so readily endorsed Black

Capitalism.

Are we so blind until we cannot see that

this is just another smoke screen to deny us of

total equality?

"We believe and understand that the term Capitalism •

as well as so-called Black Capitalism is irrelevant

to us.

For the simple reason

there will only

be

a few

more material goods, a few more advantages, a few more

privileges; so those who run the show are going to do

a little bit better.. What will happen to the Black

have-nots in this country? We must tune our minds in

on promoting the interest of the Black have-nots who

are the majority in this country, The people must con-

trol the material goods, the means of production if

they are ever to abolish exploitation of money hungry

pirates.

"We know, slick NIXON knows, and we Black Panthers

must inform and educate the people through

activity.

Activity through any means possible to bring about

radical reforms

if we are to survive as a people!!"

"BLACK MAN, • LISTEN! •

"I think there are many profound, incisive, and

elusive things that Black men find hard to say to other

Black men; but I'm inclined to believe it's the small

things of life we find hard to say to. each other--small

but important things that will mode our destiny. I'm

going to say some of the small things that are very

important dealing with our future.

Brace yourself

brothers, I'm going to give you the lay of the land!

"Here-we-are trapped in a monstrous unprecedented

dilemma that's crushing the life out of us!

Stripped

of all manhood, no authority to make any laws concerning

our lives nor authority to say when our children are to

go to school or what kind of education they are to

receive. Horrifying! Yet I hear and read so much

negative lip protest and so much negative literary pro

Begging for political justice from the enemy,

I say it's futile to ask the oppressor for freedom

because he can't free us even if he wanted to in a

Capitalistic system.

As long as we continue to beg and

rage, they will only give us arguments and continue

to say we're uncool and not ready. This really hurts

when they say we are not ready because it's the--

notorious truth--Black men don't beg, they demand:

"We must redefine the term Black Man just as

MALCOLM X and HUEY P. NEWTON did and stand firm on

our beliefs

and if necessary let there be rivers of

blood in maintaining our beliefs. As a Black Man or "

those whom are conscious of self

and environment, it

is our responsible to re-educate the people in which

they will know what avenues to approach toward alter-

nating the Black Colony in which the masses will

benefit.

"First, we must heighten the contradictions around

the so-called law and that jive • constitution. We

~8-

HH 55178 DocId:32989647 Page 54

---

## Page 55

must politically stimulate the minds of our people

where as they will understand that what is really

happening to them and why? Our teachings must focus

on national as well as international issues so we

can equate and analyze our situation with other

oppressed nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

We must heighten the contradictions around the history

in which we were white washed by the pover structure's

monstrous--misleading communication system--dogmatic

papers and books, irrelevant television series, and

naive radio programs.

"Second, we must emphasize and highly stress

that all Black Teachers, Artists and Clergymen praise

and glorily Black Freedom fighters who have been

murdered or incarcerated by hands of the enemy.

HARRIET TUBMAN--MARCUS GARVEY--MALCOLM X--DR. KING to

HUEY P. NEWTON; this must be done for pride and dignity.

These methods of teaching must be profound and incisive

in order

to bear ripe fruit.

This is needed to stimulate

the mind.

Hence, the mind

will be transformed toward

self-emancipation.

"This package carries the seeds for transplanting

a new nation of Black People. • A package that will

fuse Black Solidarity, a package that will produce

undying love and courage where as it's people will not

compromise, nor give one iota to the enemy.. They will

understand and know what they will be giving--their

freedom!

"Look! Black Man, this is the only way to lift

the yoke of bondage that is oppressing as in this

decadent oligarchy society: I see and understand

we're dealing with inhuman

elements (pigs) who have long

dehumanized each other by their racist beaucratic

- Capitalistic system which has plagued a paranois

atmosphere throughout the entire world!

• "Phoenix" and

was

distributed on Crane Junior College campus on

April

• 1 and 2, 1969:

"PIG POLICE IN BLACK COMMUNITY

"We are living in a police state (Fascism); not

only do pigs forcibly subdue all Black Orientated

organizations, but they are allowed to freely walk

the streets of our black communities and use any means

at their disposal (clubs, mace, 357 Magnums, etc.) in

order to contain and brutalize Black people.

"We must take a stand! We must be prepared for

the consequences.

We must face these pigs just as

HUEY P. NEWTON • did in this present state of police

oppression. (Pig Barbarianism) Why are so many police

in the Black Community?

Why is the stop and frisk law

only applicable to Black People? Why are our Federal,

state, county and city jails only filled and splattered

with the blood of Black People?

Why must our Black

People unnecessarily face constant police harassment

and

agitation? Why are missiles bordering every Black

Community in the country?

"Why are so many so-called riot control weapons

being stockpiled? We must understand and deal with

the fact that our community is now facing the unmerciful

gestapo--the occupational army--namely the Pig Police.

In order to deal with the tail--we must first deal with

the head boar--Tricky Dick Daily whose only claim to fame is

the exploitation of Black People! We must support,

unite and call upon all people to destroy these pigs

swiftly and in whole without mercy.

Not only must we

move on the pigs but the money hungry pirates who own

stores--grocery, clothing; hardwares, restaurants,

currency

exchanges, business events, real estate, etc.,

whom are

not sensitive and loyal to the Black Community.

No longer can we sit back and accept humiliation and

exploitation of these racist money hungry pirates.

"We must know, understand, deal with the system

that has

created these horrible conditions

for Black

People.

Capitalism 1s the mother that nursed this

monster into being. Yes! Capitalism created this

Fascist Police State along with the dehumanization

processes that has murdered millions of Black People

and mentally crippled millions of Black People. This

system must be destroyed before it destroys all of us.

The beast is on her last leg and she is pulling us

down into a bottomless cesspool with her.

This beast

is falling because of the lies she has told and the

blood shed all over the world.

"Yes!: She is lalling and she knows it? She knows

the oppressed people are sick and tired of her barbaric,

oppressive policy.

We must, for survival sake, create

a new front

in the Black Community just like.the one

HAMPTON explained the BPP ten points and

described the BPP as a military group.

He stated the

purpose of BPP is to correct the abuses in this society:

visited upon the Blacks and to build a powerful Black

society, which can deal effectively with the white beast.

All Blacks should have guns so that when the

man comes to your door you could blow him away. Whites

have been committing genocide for 400 years and now

the Blackman is beginning to fight back.

White

education

is meant only to use, control and corrupt Black youth

and foil their minds:

After Black youths are under

control, then the whiteman will move on Black adults.

HAMPTON, noting several white adults in the

audience, asked them,

In obscene terms, what they were

doing at

a Black meeting. An elderly white wonan, in

tears, stated

she and her friends meant no harm and were

just trying to

be helpful. The crowd, practically all

of Negro race,

On October 16, 1969, the current issue of "The

Proviso Herald"

, & weekly newspaper, distributed in the

laywood, Illinois area, carried an article entitled,

"Hampton Graham, blast Poverty Bias", which reads as follows:

"Thirty-nine years ago, the Melrose Park village

board denied the request of

a group of black residents

to build a church within the village, claiming it would

attract "the colored element from Maywood and Chicago.*

Last Tuesday, Proviso area blacks met in the First

Bapstist church of Melrose Park, a Negro church, to

discuss other problems of black

people in the suburbs."

The small crowd (about 35 or 40) ranged from in

tense Black Panthers with high and wide Afro haircuts

to middle aged suburban couples.

Fred Hampton, chairman of the Illinois Black

Panthers, was scheduled to appear along with the

Rev. George Clements; Dr. Charles Hurst, dean of

Malcolm X college; and Bill Graham of Maywood's

Human Relations commission.

Hurst and Clements didn't show, so Graham led

off with a multi-pronged attack on what the federal

and local government is and is not doing.

*When genocide can be forced upon us, there

is some question as to the sanity of a system that

Graham,

He also cited poor housing for low and low middle

PEORIA, ILLINOIS

BLACK PANTHER PARTY (BPP)

Party (BPP) was started during December, 1966,

According to its official newspapes, in Oakland,

the Black Panther

California, to organize blaok people so

they can take control

of the life, politics, and the destiny of the black cormunity.

It was organized by Bobby George. Seale, BPP Chairman, and

Huey P. Newton, BPP Minister of Defense. Newton is presently

serving a sentence of 2 to 15 years on a conviction of man-.

slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police

officEr.

The official newspaper,

"The Black Panther", which

further describes itself as the "Black Community News

Service",

states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilia

cacties

in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the

black people.

Residents of the black community are urged to arm

therselves against the

police who are consistently referred to

in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains

an editorial by BPP Ninister of Education, George Mason Murray,

which ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere!

Arm yourselves.

The only culture worth

keeping is a revolutionary culture. Change.

Freedon everywhere.

Dynamite!

Black Power.

Use the gun. Kill

the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing

in the October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the

statement, "

...we will

not dissent from American Governnent.

We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain

quotations from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the

People's Republic of China and feature MAO's statement that

"political power grows

out of the barrel of a gun."

MILITARY TRAINING SCHEDULE

A lour week mandatory class for all members

(luesday,

Thursday and Sunday) with the exclusion of all non-members. Two

classes should be conducted by a small military staff, classes

conducted expressing party ideology, and stressing military

discipline at all times! Upon the entering of the classroom of

the military instructor

all talking should cease and all trainers

should take a firm attentative standing position and remain in

this manner until given the order to be seated. All classes

or class activities should begin with: All Power the People

and victory to the People's Revolution. The main purpose of the

class is to give every party member a basic practical knowledge

of the military phase of the

peoples' struggle.

There should ba

no absenteeism from the Political Education Classes (no excuses),

reason being a military mind without a people's ideology is a

hired killer and the people don't nead no more pigs.

Classas

should be conducted in an orderly manner at all times.

STRUCTURE OF THE CLASSES

1. Discipline

A.

Disciplina is the exact execution of orders resulting

from an intolligent, willing obedience rather than one

based solely upon habit or fear.

Discipline is

necessary

to secure orderly action which

alone can triunph over

the seemingly impossible conditions of battle.

The party

members mu't be able to recognize and

face fear because

fear is the

enemy of discipline.

Fear unchecked will

lead to panic and a unit that panics is no longer a

discipline unlt but a nob. There is no sane person who

is without fear,, but with

good discipline and high morale

all can face danger.

Punishment of individual members for

braacher of discipline is

sometimes necessary, but only

to reform or eliminate those who are unfit to

serve the

People's Revolution.

National Convention in New York City May 31 to June 2. 1968, it which

time the PL? reasserted its objective of the establishment of a militant

raising the consciousness of the people and helping to provide idedlogical

leadership in the working class struggle for state power.

APPENDIX

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY:

A source has advised that the Students for a Democratic

Society (SD3), as it is known today, came into being at a founding

convention held at fort furon, vichigan, in June, 1962. From an

initial ideological posture of "participatory democracy," the current

line of the national leadership reveals an adherence to Marxism-Leninism.

Michael Klonsky, National Secretary, In March, 1965, called for the

building of & revolutionary Marist-Leninist movement. The program

o1 SDS has moved from involvement in civil rights struggles to a7 anti-

Vietnam war position and finally to its present advocacy of an in i-

imperialist line, linking up the oppressed peoples of Asia, Afrie, and

Latin America with the black liberation movement in the United Fintes.

China,

Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as countries which are lading

the world-wide struggles against United States imperialism. On the

other hand, SDS regards the Soviet Union as an imperialist yove and

does not support the policies of that country.

SDS maintains a National Office in Room 206, 1608 West

Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois.

Its official paper "New Left: Notes"

reflects the line of the national leadership and program adopted at

meetings of the National Council and National Interim Committee

(NIC). Three national officers and a NIC of eleven membeis aro

elected each year during a June National Convention.

SDS Regional Offices and university and collega chapters

elect delegates to National Council meetings wherein program and

ideology are debated, but each Region and chapter is autoromous ir:

nature and is free to carry out independent policy and progrims

reflective of local conditions.

CLASS

We see that the hey to truly understanding and improving our situation

Is to truly understand the nature of class society. lie see that in

America and in the world that those who have money control those wro

do not. WEALTH-POWER! We feel that the wealth of the world should

Da shared equally among all people. The workers or the masses of

the people produce the wealth and they should control it. We see

that our allies are those who have nothing and our enemies are those

who have too much.

2.

WELFARE OF THE PEOPLE

We believe that all people are entitled to adequate food, clothings

shelter and medical care. We believe that businessmen should not make

a proilt on the things that we need to survive. We demand decent and

•adequate housing at a low cost for poor people. We demand safe,

clean day care centers for

who went to raise their children in their own home be paid for this

vital work.

PIGS & PIG POWER STRUCTURE

We demand the end to the pigs murdering and brutalizing our people.

The gigs are the tool of the rich man. The pigs are in our comminity

We understand that the main purpose of the educational system as it

Joy stands 18 to make people fit smoothly into the capitalistic class

society, We understand that the children of poor people are trained

to be poor people:-the children os factory workers are trained to

voris in factories--che children of rich people are trained to take

Iike prisons because this society is a prison. We demand that all

people know their true history. We demand that all people have the

opportunity to develop their abilities.

DRAFT

We oppose the draft because it means poor and working class men fighting

rich mens wars. We oppose imperialistic wars of agression such as the one.

in Viet Nam, We believe that all patriotic men and women should serve only

In the aruy of liberation. Rich people can buy their way out of the draît,

stay home and construct

6a UNION

Labor unions are a good thing. But we still know that the majority of

Americans work long hours under bad conditions for poor wages and never

I965,

The official replied,

actually that's not our direct responsibility. lou see,

The students were shocked, but the AlD man went on to

tell them why he thought this was a good thing tointing to a con

struction site, he said,

"See that housing projoet?

We got a U.i.

construction company to come down here and build low cost housing

units for local workers and their familias."

One of the students asked the man, "How much do you charge for one?"

AID man:

"$2,500 altogether, but

Student:

that's in small monthly payments."

"How much does it

cost to build one?"

All man:

"Well, the companies have to make a profit..."

Student:

"Come on, how much?"

AID man:

"about #800 a piece."

What has happened here?

"ABOUT FRED"

"As 'o result of an act of repression by America"s "Pig Power Structure;"

there now exists another "Political Prisonere""

As of, May 26, 19:89, America once again has kidnapped from the oppressed

masses, a man concerned solely with our liberation and freedom. Chairman of

the Illinois Chapter of the Black Panther Party, Chairman Fred Hampton is tem-

porarily (jailed) in a 'wéll known' Illinois Concentration Camp. We say, "tem-

porarily jailed" because we know and fully understand that once you, the masses,

realize just what fred Hampton stands for, fights, for, and what U.S. capitalism

and U.S. imperalism stands for, you too will sirive to FREE CHAIRMAN FRED;

AND ALL OTHER POLITICAL PRISONERS.

In regards to accomplishing 'our' mission, we ask for your support in attending

the planned rally in Honor of Chairman Fred Hampton. As well as a day of en-

joyment, this will also be a day of education for all. And it may even be a day

.-of bringing about more unity to oppressed people of America.

On June 4, 1969 SA RAMON W. STRATTON was present at

2350 West Madison, Chicago, Illinois, when arrests were made

for harboring a fugitive from justice, in building occunied by

an organization calling themselves the Black Panthers.

Special

Agent In Charge MArLIN". Johnson of the Cricago Federal Bureau

of Investigation office instructed sA STRAtION to conduct

a lawful

search of the building in which the arrests were made,

with assistance of other Special Agents, of the FBI.

Posters, pamphlets, printed material and machines

were observed on the walls, floors,

desks and chairs and it

appeared to SA STRATTON that these

items would be subject

to seizure under a search warrant issued im conformance with

Rule 4L (b) of the Federal Kules of Criminal Procedure in

conjunction with violations of Title 19, US. Code, Sections

2383, 2384 and 2385.

Section 2383 relates to rebellion or insurrection

against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof

or in giving aid and comfort thereto..

put down, or to destroy by force the Goverment of the United

Section 2385 relates to willfufly advocating, etc.

the overthrow of the Government of the United States and

the printing, etc. of material,

persons for such purposes.

and the orgnizing, etc. of

SA STRATION therefore directed titat certain

materials be seized and preserved as evidence of violations of

laws of the United States,

possibly being connitted in presence

of Agents, both as mere evidence and as material designed

or intended for use or wilich is or has beenused as means of

-n conducting this search, the following matters

were considered:

The arrests were completed between approximately

5:30 a.m. and 6:00 a.mo and it would not be possible to

prepare detailed affidavits for search warrant and appear

before the U.S. Commissioner or a District lourt judge

for several hours.

The building had been prepared with electrical

devices and with solid steel doors and iron doors and bars

placed over entrances, exits and windows, thusly preventing

any entrance without breaking and entering and with

firearms.

Several weapons were present and seized

and it is known to Agents that this organization calling

thenselves the Black Panthers has consistently stated that

attempt's to search or to effect arrests would be violently

resisted, even with firearmis.

=?.

That attempts to enter the builaing naù wet'

no copperation of any kind from persons in the building,

and any future'attempts to enter would. undoubtedly. be met

in the same way, necessstating an armed force sufficient

to effect the execution off a search warrant, thus making

it impractical, to obtain and effect a search by warrant

on the same day.

Likelihood of destruction of evidence and removal

of evidence while the paperwork necessary for a search

by search warrant was being accomplished and filed.

This same pig creates disorder in our schools, and vamps on us when

we stand up for what is ours, as Manuel did. We make demands for belter conditions

in our schools. Maruel made a demand for the people. He said, "Mon, I believe all

people should have power whether they're Black, Brown, or White." And for that he

was assassinated.

Manuel's murder is no exception. Everyday our brothers and sisters are murdered and

vamped on by the pigs.

1--Charles Cox, beaten to death by trio pigs in the pigsty last week.

--Lil' Bobby Hutton, shot i8 times in the back, because he demanded justice

for all people..

--Ron Nelson, whose pig murderer Nuccio was convicted by the people, but

put back on the streets by the racist pig power structure and their locky

kangaroo courts.

--And thousands of other brothers and sisters whose murderers remain armed and

loose and dangerous on the streets.

The people are now demanding some of the "low, and order and justice" that the pig power

structure talks about so much.

We have organized a march on

the 18th district piguty, where the head hog, State Attorney

Hanrahan will be and demand action against assassin Pig Lamb Now. • •

--We demand the indictment and conviction of Pig Lamb for murder

--We, demand the release of our brothers arrested to cover up murderer Lamb

The people have lot the pigs rule and terrorize us for too long. They have kept up divided

and confused thru rocism. We must stop fighting each other and take on our real enemy --

the racist power structure and their army of pigs. We must act together and demand that

their jive laws work for us -- the People.

We know that the courts have never worked for us. That they are controlled

by the some pig power structure that sends its army of pigs to murder and

horass us. We will demand that they give us justice... but when they do not

we will take it.

northside (1400 North Cleveland)

will continue to operate from

Soon, we will open up a free health clinic, another

thing which the people need.

And in the vord: of deputy Chairman Fred

"You can jail a revolutionary,

but you can't jail revolution.

You can kill a liberator»

-

but you can't kill liberation.

You can run a freedom fighter around the country:

but you can't run freedom.

Because, if you do, you come up with questions that

don't question,

answers that don't answer, conclusions that don't

conclude, explanations that don't explin and ending:

thạt don't end."

So, the pigs.con refuse. to let us use the centers büilt

bits of so-called "legalily" lo koen us from opening up a tree

ás basically: nou a rcauing community. There sure it is vory significant that inc

vanguard group first be activists. Without this knowige of the black community,

one could not gain the fundenental. knowadge of the black revolution in racist

•America.

The main fuction of the party is to awaken the people and to teach them the

strategic nethod of resisting the pover stricture, which is prepared not only to

combat the resistance of the people with massive brutality, but to totally ami~

hilate the black commugitas the black population

If it is learned by the power structure that black people have"y" amount of

guis in their possession, this will not stimulate the power structure lo prepare

itself vith guis, because

it is alrcady more than propared.

The end result of this education vill be positive. for Black people in their

reisitance and negative for the pover structure in its oppression, because the

party always exemplifies revolutionary dcfiance. If the party is not going to

make the people aware of the tools of liberatin and the strategic method that is

to be used, there will be no means by which the peoul will be mobilized properly.

The pelationship between the vanguard party and tit masses is a secondary

relationship.

The rclationship between the nenburs of the vanguard party is a

primary relationship.

It is important that the merbers of the vanguard group

mairitain a face-tofare- relationship wiih each other. This is important if ti.

party muchinory is to bo affective. It is impossible to put together functional

party machinery or programs without this direct relationship. The menbers of the

vanguaid group should be tested revolutionaries. This will minimize the danger

of Uncle Ton inforner's and opportunists.

The main purpose of vanguard group shoulc be to raise the consciousness of

the massos through educational prograns and certain physical activitics the farty

will participate in.

The slecping masses must be bombarded with the correct

approach to struggle through the activities of the vanguard party.

Therefore,

the masses must know that the party exists. The party mist use all ncans

availaule to get this information across to the masses. If the masses do not

have knowledge of the party, it will be impossible for the masses to follow

the program of the party.

The vanguard party is never underground in the beginning of its existence,

because this would limit its effectiveness and educational processes. How can you

teach people if the poople do not know the and respect jou? The party must exist

above ground as long as thodos power structure will allow, aid hopcrully when the

party is forcid to go underground the armiage of the party wiil alroady have been

put across lo the people.

The vanguard parly's activities on in surface vill

necessarily be shortlived. :

This is why it is so importint that the party make a trerendous impact

1. We want freedom. We want power to determine the destiny of our

Black Commumty.

We believe that black people will not be free until we are able to deler.

mine our destiny.

2. He want full employment for our people.

We beliove that the federal government is responsible and obligated lo

give every man employment or a guaranteed income. We beliere thiat if

the white Amorien businessmen will not give full employment, then the

means of production should be taken from the businessmen and placed in

the community so that the people of the community can organize andani

ploy all of its people and give a high standard of living.

3. He want an end to the robbery by the white man of our Black Com.

munity.

We bolieve that this racist gorernment has robbed us and now we are

demanding the overdue debt of forty acres and two mules. Forty acres

and two mules was promised 100 yours ago as restitution for are labor

and mass murder of black people. We will accopt the payment in Currency

which will be distributed to our many communities. The Germans are noir

aiding the Jew's in Israel for the genocide of the Jewish people. Tlie Ger-

six million Jews. The American racist has talich part in

the slaughter of over fifty million black people; therefore, we feel that this

is a modest demand that we make.

4. We sant decent housing, fit for sheltegof human beings.

We beliere that if the white landlords will pet give decent housing is

our black conmunity. then the housing and the land should be made into

sopperatives so that our community, with guvernment aid, can bulld and

make decent housing for its people.

5. We sant esucation for our people that exposes the true nature of this

decadent american society. De want education that teaches us out true

history and our role in the present day society.

'We believe in an educational system that will give to our people a knoss.

edge of self. If a man does not have knowledge of himself and his position

in society and the world, then he has little chance to relaie to anything

6. We want all black men to be exempt from military service.

We believe that Plack people should not be forced to fight in the mili-

tary service to defend a racist government that does noi protect us. We

will not fight and kill other people of color in the world who. like black

people, are being victimized by the white racist government of America.

• We will protect ourselves from the force and violence of the racist police

and the racist military, by whatever means necessary.

7. We sant an immediale cad to POLICE BRUTALITY and MURDER

or blach people.

We believe we can end police brutality in our black community by or

ganizing black self-defense groups that are dedicated to defending our

black community from racist police oppression and brutality. The Second

Amendment to the Constitution of the l'nited Stales gives a right to bear

arms: We therefore beliere that äil black peogle should arm themselves

for self-dcfense.

• 8. We want freedom for all black men held in federal, state, counts

and city prisons and jails.

We bolieve

that all black people should de released from the many

jails and prisons because they have not receivet a fair and impartial trial.

9. We want all black people when brought latrial to be tried in court by

a jury of their peer group or people from heir black communities, as

defined by the Constitution of the linited Stales.

We beliere that the courts should follow the United States Constitution

so that black people will receive fair trials. The 14th Amendment of the

U.S. Constitution gives a man a right to be tard by his peer group. A peer

defendant came. We have been, and are beng tried by all-white juries

that have no understanding of the "average reasoning man" of the black

community.

10. We want land, bread, housing, education clothing. justice and pence.

And as ou major political objective, a United Nations-supervised plebis-

ite to be hold througho the black colonym which only blach colonia

morts sill be allowed to participate, for the purgose of determining tho

will of black people as to their national destig.

When, in the course of numan erents. in bucomes necessary for one

people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with

anothor, and to assume, among the powers oftile earth. the separate and

equal staton to which the lass of nature andnutures God chutle them, a

decent respect to the opions of mankind regures that they should declare

the causes which impel them to the separation

We hold these truths to be self-evident, tut all men are created equal;

that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights:

that anong these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That, (o

secure these righis, governments are institutaliamong men, derising their

Just powers from the concent of the governed; that, honeser any form of

government becomes destructive of these encks, it is the right of the prople

to aller or to abolish il, and to institue a nes government, laying ils

foundation on such principles, and organizingits posters in such forms, as

1o them shall seem most likely to effect their safely and happiness. Pru-

dence, indeed, will dictate that governmentslong established should not

be-changed for light and transieut causes; aud.accordingly. all experience

hath shoss, that mankind are more disposai. to suffer, while evils are

sufferable, than to right themselves by abohsting the forms to which they

are accustomed. But, wen a long train of alus's and unsurpations, pur-

suing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under :b-

solute despotisfi, it is their right, it is their saty, to thros off such govern-

ancht, and to provide new guards for their fatre security.

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the Students for a Democratic

Society (SDS), as it is known today, came into being al a founding

tian do gic at posted ican demo, the man

" the current

line of the national leadership reveals an adherence to Marxism-Leninism.

Michael Klonsky, National Secretary, in March, 1969, called for the

Vietnam war position and finally to its present advocacy of an anti-

imperialist lie, linking up the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and

Latin America with the black liberation movement in the United States.

China, Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as countries which are leading

the world-wide struggles against United States imperialism. On the

other hand, SDS regards the Soviet Union as an imperialist power and"

does not support the policies of that country.

SDS maintains a National Office in Room 206, I608. West

Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois. Its official paper "New Left Notes"

reflects the line of the national leadership and program adopted at

meetings of the National Council and National Interim Committee

(NIC). Three national officers and a NIC of eleven members are

elected each year during a June National Convention.

SDS Regional Offices and university and college chapters

elect delegates to National Council meetings wherein program and •

ideology are debated, but each Region and chapter is autonomous in

nature and is free to carry out independent policy and programs

reflective of local conditions.

STUDENT NUNVIULENT CUURDINATING CUMMITTEE (SNCC)

The Student Monviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC),

headquartered at 360-362 Nelson Street, S. W., Atlanta, Georgia,

18 & nonombership organization, which yas born out of the

sit-in movement that erupted across the south beginning

in 1960.

Today SNCC identilies itsell as an organization in

the revolutionary verguard. It advocates that to be successiul

it is necessary to develop & revolutionary ideodogy and

revolutiongry program.

According to SNCC the year 1987 marked a historic

milestone in the struggle for the liberation of black people

the United states and the year that revolutionaries

throughout the world

baren to understand more lubly the lapact

of the

black movement.

SNCC declared that "liberation vili

come only when there 1s final dostruction of this mad octopus--

the capitallatic systen of the United States with all its

life-sucking tentacles of exploitation and racian that choke

the people of Africa, Asia, and Latia Anerica. The realities

of black life, together with the recoguition instilled in SNCC

workers forced its members to lurther popularize the legitinacy

of sell-dolense and rebellions when oppression became too great."

From kay, 1966, until Hay, 1967, Stokely Carmichael

was National Chairman of SNCC. As of July, 1968, Carmichael

resided in Washington, D. C., Where he was affiliated with

SNCC and active as temporary chairasa of a black coalition

group. In May, 1967, Carmichael was replaced by Hubert Geroid

BrOWD,

commonly KDOWD aS H. RAD PrOYD, who served until

JuDe,

1968.

In June, 1968, &t the Stall and Central Committee

meeting of SNCC held in

Atlanta, Georgia, 1t was decided to

restructure the organization by equalization of responsibility

by creating ten deputy or vice chairmanshipa.

The primary.

purpose for this change is to taie law enforcement pressure off

any single individual.

Two classes should be conducted by a small military staff, classes

conducted expressing party ideology, and stressing military

discipline at all times.

Example:

the enterity of the

class-

cease and a11

There

(no excuses), reason being a military mind without a people's

ideology

is a

hired killer and the people don't need nu more pigs.

Classes should be conducted in an orderly mamer at all times.

Structure of the Classes

I. Discipline:

A. Discipline is the exact execution of orders resulting from an

intelligent, willing obedience, rather than one. based solely

upon habit or fear. Discipline is necessary to secure orderly

action which alone

can triumph over the seemingly impossible

condition of battle.

The party members must be able to recognize

and face fear because fear is the enemy of discipline. Fear

unchecked will lead lo panic and a unit that panics is no longer

a disciplined unit, out a mob.

There is no saneperson who is

without fear, but

with good discipline and high monale all can

face danger.

Punishment of individual members for breaches of

discipline are somelimes necessary, but only to reform or

eliminate those whoare unfit to serve the peoplo's revolution.

I. To be learned verbatim and understood thoroughly:

the racist imperialist institutions of A-

merica from oppressing that particular

country. The country cannot implement

its racist program without the guns. And

the guns are the military and the police.

It the military were disarmed in Vietnam,

then the Vietnamese would be victorious.

We are in the same situation here in

America. Whenever we attack the system

the first thing the administrators do is to

send out their strongarm men. If it's a

rent strike, because pi the indecent housing

we have, they will send out the police to

throw the furniture out the window. 'They

point that the guerrilla man the go nfret

to fit in directly with the guerrilla as

a political man. Would you like to comirent

on this?

HUFY: Yes, The

unique man. This is in contrast to Marxist-

Leninist orthodox theories where the party

controls the military. The guerrilla is not

the miliary niginer;

gun is only an extension

of the body,

the extension of our fanged teeth that we

lost through evolution.

It's the weapon,

it's the claws that we lost, it's the body.

The guerrilla is the military cominander

and the political theoretician all in one.

In Bolivia Che said that he got very

little help from the Communist Party

there. The Communist Party wanted to

be the mind, the Communist Party wanted

to have full control

activity. But yet weren't taking part in

the practical work of the guerrillas. The

guerrilla on the other hand is not only

united within himself, but he also attempts

toispread this to the people by educating

the villagers,

giving them political per-

pointing out things, educating

them politically, and arming the people.

• Therefore the guerrilla is giving the

peasants and workers a mind. Because

they've already got the bodyiyou get a

unity of the mind and the body. Black

people here in America, who have long

been the

workers,

INTRODUCTION

"Essays From the Minister of Defense" is a collection

of truths, principles and beliefs practiced by the Black

Panther Party.

The writings come from. the pen of Huey

Newion, the Minister of Defense of the Black Panther Par-

ty but the spirit of the writings, the faith expressed and the

indying love for black people exhibited therein comes irom

he souls of colonized black people. The people are the

heroes.

The Black Panther Party is a vanguard! party for we

Africans in U.S. What we belleve in is armed revolution,

a Dermanent revolution, the creation of as many Viet Nams

as are necessary to defeat U.S. racism and imperialisn

throughout the world. As you read "Essays From the Mi-

ister of Defense" you will begin to understand the princi

ples for therarmed revolution that is beginning in the U.s.

If you carry outthe principles, you willl be a people's war-

„rior, and will be bringing black people and the oppresse:

people everywhere closer to freedom, justice, and equai-

ity throughout the world. The Minister of Defense is c.:-

rently held in Alameda County jail.

Our slogan is Huey will be set free by any means nt.

essary and if he is not set free the sky is the limit.

N DEFENSE OF SELF DEFENSE

By Huey P. Newton

Introduction:

Huey P. Newton's column in THE BLACK PANTHER

newspaper was entitled "In Defense of Self Defense." The

following articles by the Minister of Defense were taken

from those columns.

"In Defense of Self Defense."

June 20, 1967.

Laws and rules have always been made to serve peo-

ple. Rules of society are set up by people so that they will

be able to function in a harmonious way. In other words,

P- in order to promote the general welfare of society, rules

and laws are established by men. Rules should serve men,

and not men serve rules.

Much of the time. the laure tond!

rules which officials attempt to inflict upon poor people are

non-functional in relation iu ihe status, of the poór in socie-

These officials are blind to the fact that people should

not respect rules that are not serving them. It is the duty

of the poor to write and construct rules and laws that are

in their better interests. This is one of the basic human

rights of all men.

Before 1776, white people were colonized by the Eng-

lish. The English government had certain laws and rules

that the colonized Americans viewed as not in their best

interests but as

a colonized people.

At that time the Eng-

lish government felt that the colonized Americans had no

right to establish laws to promote the general welfare of

the people living here in America.

The colonized Ameri-

can felt he had no choice but to raise the gun in defense of o

the welfare of the colonized people.

At this time, he made

certain laws insuring his protection from external and in

ternal aggressions

from governinents and agencies. One

such form of protection was the Neclaration of Indepen-

dence, which states:

"... whenever any government be-

comes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the

people no altergito

people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new fir.

ernment, laying its foundations on such principles and or-

ganizing its powers in such forms as to them shall seen:

most likely to effect their safety and happiness.

Now these same colonized white people, inese ex-

slaves, robbers, and thieves, have denied the colonier

black

man the right to even speak of abolishine this rp-

pressive system which the white colonised Amerin ire-

ated. They have carried their madness to the tir cur-

ners of the earth, and now there is universal rebellin

against their continued rule and power.. The Black perpl

in America are the only people who can free the world,

loosen the yoke of colonialism and destroy the war ::ia-

chine. As long as the wheels of the imperialistic wir ma-

chine are turning there is no country that can defeat this

monster of the West. Bul Black people can make a mal-

function of this machine from within. Black people can

destroy the machinery that's enslaving the world. Ameri-

ca cannot stand to fight every Black country in the world

impossible to do both of these things at once.

The slavery of Blacks in this country provides the oil

for the machigery of war that America uses to enslave the

peoples of the world. Without this oil the machinery can-

not function. We are the driving shaft; we are in such a

strategic position in this machinery that, once we become

dislocated, the functioning of the remainder uf the machin-

ery breaks down.

Penned up in the ghettos of America, surrounded by

his factories and all the physical components of his eco-

nomic system, we have been made into "the wretched of

the earth, " who are relegated to the position of spectators

while the white racists run their international con game un

the suffering peoples.

We have been brainwashed to be-

lieve that we are powerless and that there is nothing we

can do for ourselves to bring about a speedy liberation for

our people. We have been taught that we must please our

oppressors, that we are only ten per cent of the population,

and therefore, we must confine our tactics to categories

calculated not to disturb the sleep of our tormentors.

It Black people go about their struggle for liber-

ation in the way that the oppressor dictates and sponsors,

then we will have degenerated to the level uf grovelling

primarily on the fact that they are organized and united

with each other. They are recognized by the powers of the

world.

We, with all our numbers, are recognized by no one.

¿ In fact, we do not even recognize vur own selves. We are

unaware of the potential power latent in our mumbers. In

. 1967, in the midst of a hostile racist nation whose hidden e

racism is rising to the surface at a phenonsenal speed, we

are still

so blind to our critical fight for our very survival

that we are continuing to function in petty, futile ways. Di-

vided, confused; fighting among ourselves, we are still

in the elementary stage of throwing rocks, sticks, empty

wine bottles and beer cans at racist cops who lie in wait

for a chance to murder unarmed Black people.

The racist

cops have worked out a system for suppressing these spon-

taneous rebellions that'flare up from the anger, frustra-

tion, and desperation of the masses of Black people. We

can no longer afford the dubious luxury of the terrible

casualties wantonly inflicted upon us by the cops during

these spontaneous rebellions.

Black people must now move, from the grassroots up

through the perfumed circles of the Black bourgeoisie, to

seize by any means necessary a proportionate share of the

power vested and collected in the structure of America.

We must organize and unite to combat by long resistance

the brutal force used against us daily.

The power struc-

ture depends upon the use of force within retaliation. This

is why they have made it a felony to teach guerilla wartare.

This is why they want the people unarmed.

The racist dog oppressor fears the armed people; they

fear most of all Black people armed with weapons and the

ideology of the Black Panther Party For Self Defense. An

unarmed people are slaves or are subject to slavery at any

given moment. If a government is not afraid of the people

it will arm the people from foreign aggression. Black

people are held captive in the midst of their oppressors.

There is a world of difference between thirty million un-

armed, submissive Black people and thirty million Black

people armed with freedom and defense guns and the stra-

tegic methods of liberation.

When a mechanic wants to fix a broken-down car en-

gine, he must have the necessary tools to do the job.

When the people move for liberation, they must have the

basic tool of liberation: the gun. Only with the power of

the gun can the Black masses halt the terror and brutality

perpetuated against them by the armed racist power atruc-

ture; and in one sense only by the power of the gun can the

whole world be transformed into the earthly paradise

dreamed of by the people from time immemorial. One

successful pra-titioner of the art and science of national

liberation and self defense, Brother Mao 'I'se-tung, put a

lake up the gun. "

The blood, sweat, tearsand suffering of Black people

are the foundations of the wealth and power of the United

States of America. We were forced to build America, and

if forced to, we will tear it down. The immediate result

of this destriction will be sufforing and bloodshed. But

the end result will be the perpetual peace for all mankind.

"In Defense of Self Defense"

July 3, 1967

Historically, the power structure has demanded thât

Black leaders cater to their desires and to the ends of the

imperialistic racism of the oppressor. The power struc-

Pture has endorsed those Black leaders who have reduced

themselves to nothing more than apologizing parrots.

- They have divided the so-called black leaders within the

political arena. The oppressors sponsor radio programs,

sire space in their racist newspapers; and have shown

them the luxury enjoyed only by the oppressor.

Black leaders serve the oppressor by purposely keeping

the people submissive and passive - non-violent.

moment that these so-called Black leaders respond to the

cries of the suffering and downtrodden, unemployed and

welfare recipients who hunger for liberation by any

means necessary.

Historically, there have been a few Black men who

have rejected the handouts of the oppressor and who have

refused to spread the oppressor's treacherous principles

of deceit, gradual indoctrination and brainwashing, and

who have refused

to indulge in the criminal activity oi

teaching submission, fear, and love for an enemy who

hates the very

culor black and is determined to cominit

genocide on an international scale.

There has always existed in the Black colony of Afro-

America a fundamental difference over which tactics

from the broad spectrum of alternatives Black peuple

should employ in their

struggle for national liberation.

One side of this difference contends that Black people

are in the peculiar position where, in order to gain ac-

ceptance into the "mainstream" of American life, they

must employ no tactic that will anger the oppressor

whites. "This view holds that Black people constitute"

hopeless minority and that salvation for Black people lies

in developing brotherly relations. There are certain

tactics that are taboo. Violence against the oppressor

must be avoided at all costs, because the oppressor will

retaliate with superior violence. So Black people may

protest, but not protect. They can complain, but not cut

and shoot. In short, Black people must at all costs re-

main non-violent.

On the other side of the difference, we find that the

point of departure is the principle that the oppressor has

no rights that the oppressed is bound to respect. Kill the

slavemaster, destroy him utterly, move against him

with implacable fortitude. Break his oppressive power

by any means necessary. Men who have stood leafe

- the Black masses and recornmended this response to the

oppression have been held in fear by the oppressor.

Blacks in the colony who were wed to the non-violent

alternative Yould not relate to the advocates of implacable

opposition to the oppressor. Because the oppressor al-

ways prefers to deal with the less fadical, i.e., less

dangerous, spokesmen for his subjects.

He would pre-

fer that his subjects had no spokesmen at all, or better

yet, he wishes to speak for them himself.

Unable to do

this pra-tically, he does the next best thing, and endorses

spokesmen who will allow him to speal: through

them to

the masses. Paramuunt amongst his imperatives is to

see to it that implacable spokesmen are never allowed

to communicate their message to the masses. They are

never allowed to communicate their message to the

masses:. Their oppressor will resort to any means

necessary to, silence the implacables.

The oppressor, the endorsed spokesmen, and the

implacables form the three points of a triangle of death.

The oppressor looks upon the endorsed spokesmen as a

tool to use against the implacables to keep the masses

passive within the acceptable limits of the tactics he is

capable of containing. The endorsed spokesmen look

15?

## Page 578

upon the oppressor as a guardian angel who can always be

depended upon to protect them from the wrath of the im-

placables, while he looks upon the implacables as dan-

gerous and irresponsible madmen who, by angering the

oppressor, will certainly provoke a blood bath in which

they themselves might get washed away. The implacables

view both the oppressors and the endorsed leaders as his

deadly enemies.

If anything, he has a more profound

hatred for the endorsed leaders

than he has fur the op-

pressor himself, because the implacables know that

they can deal with the oppressor only after they have

driven the endorsed spokesmen off the scene.

ilistorically, the endorsed spokesmen have always

held the upper hand on the implacables. In Afro-Ameri

can history, there are shining brief moments when the

&-implacables have outmaneuvered the oppressor and the

endorsed spokesmen and gained the attention of the

Black masços. The Black masses, recognizing the

implacables in the depths of their despair, respond

magnelically io the implacables and bestow à devotion

and loyalty to them that frightens the oppressor and en-

dorsed spokesmen into a panic-stricken frenzy, and

they leap into a rash at -- murder, imprisonment, or

exile -= to silence the implacables and to det their show

back on the ruad.

The masses of Black people have always been

deeply entrenched and involved in the basic necessities

of life. They have not had time to abstract their situ-

ation. Abstractions come only with leisure. The

people have nut had the luxury of leisure. Therefgre,

the people have been very aware of the true definition

of politics: pulities are merely the desire of individuals

and groups to satisfy first, their basic needs -- food,

shelter and clothing, and

socurity for then selves and

their loved ones. The Black loaders endorsed by the

power structure have attempted to sell the people the

The Black leaders have led the community to believe

that brutality and force could be ended by subjecting the

people to this very force of self-sacrificing demonstra-

•The Black peuple realize brutality and force can

only be inflicted if there is submission. The community

has not responded in the past of in the present to the ab-

surd and erroncuus, deceitful tactics of so-called legiti-"

mate Black leaders.

The community realizes that force

and brutality can only be eliminated by counter force

through self defense. Leaders who have recommended

these tactics have never had the support and following

of the downtrodden black masses who comprise the bulk

of the community. Grassroots -- the downtrudden of

the Black community, even though they rejected the hand-

picked handkerchief heads endursed by the power struc-

ture, the people have not had the academic or administra-

tive knowledge to form themselves in long resistance to

the brutality.

Marcus Garvey and Malcolm X were the two Black

men of the twentieth century who posed an implacable

• challenge to both the oppressor and the endorsed spokes-

men that could be dealt with in any other way than pre-

cisely the foulemanner recorded by history. Malcolm,

in our time, stood on the threshhold with the oppressor

and the endorsed spokesmen in a bag that they coulin't

get out of.

Malcolm, implacable to the ultimate degree,

held out to the Black masses the historical, stupendous

victory of Black collective salvation and liberation from

the chains of the oppressor and the treacherous embrace

of the endorsed spokesmen. Only with the gun were the

black masses denied this victory. But they learned from

Malcolm that with the gun, they can recapture their

dreams and bring them into reality.

The heirs of Malcolmn now stand millions strung on

their corner of the triungle, facing the racist dug op-

pressor and the soulless endorsed spokesmen: The

heirs of Malcolm have picked up the gun and, taking

first things first, are moving to expose the endorsed

spokesmen fur the Black masses to see thei for what

the heirs of Malcolm to the endorsed spokesmen is to

repudiate the oppressor and to crawl back to their people

But first, they must respect the party which is trans-

mitting this message. When the Vanguard group destroy's

the machinery of the oppressor by dealing with him an

small groups of threc and four, and then escapes the

minht of the oppressor, the masses will be uverjuyed

and well here to this correct strategy. When the masses

hear that a gestapo policeman has been exicuted while

sipping coffee at a counter, and the revolutionary execu-

tioners fled without being traced, the masses will see the

validity of this type of approach to resistance. It is not

necessary to organize thirty million Black peuple in pri-

mary groups of two's and three's but it is important for

the party to show the people how to go about revolution.

During slavery, in which no vanguard party existed and

forms of communication were severely restricted and in-

sufficient, many slave revolts uccurred.

There are basically three ways oge can learn:

throogh study, through observation.oand throunh aitual

experience. The black community is basically composed

ofactivists. The communit; learns through activity,

either through observation uf or participation in the acti-

rity. To study and learn is good but the actual experience

is the best means

of learning. The party must engage ir

activities that will teach the people. "The black community

is basically not a reading community. Therefore it is

very significant that the vanguard group first be activists.

Without this knowledge of the black community, one

could

not gain the fundamental knowledge of the black revolution

in racist America.

The main function of the party is tu awaken the people

and to teach them the strategic method of resisting the

power structure, which is prepared not only to combat the

resistance of. the people with massive brutality, but to

totally annihilate the black community, the black popula-

tion.

If it is learned by the power structure that black peo-

ple have "x" amount of guns in their possession, this will

not stimulate the power structure to prepare itself with

guns, because it is already more than prepared.

The end

result of this education will be positive for

Black people in their resistance and negative for the

power structure in its oppression, because the party al-

ways exemplifies revolutionary defiance. If the party

is not going to make the people aware of the toois of lib-

eration'

and-the strategic method that is to be used, there

will be no means by which the people will pe mobilized

properly.

The relationship between the vanguard party and the

masses is a secondary relationship. The relationship be-

tween the members of the vanguard party is a primary

relationship. It is important that the members of the van~

guard group maintain a face-to-face relationship with each

other. This is important if the party machinery is to Fe

effective. It is impossible to put together functional party

machinery or programs without this direct relationship.

§ The members of the vanguard group should be tested revo-

lutionaries. This will minimize the danger of Uncle Iom

- informers and opportunists.

The main purpose of vanguard group should be to

raise the consciousness of the masses through educational

programs and certain physical activities the party will

participate in.

The sleeping masses must be bombarded

with the correct approach to struggle through the activi-

ties of the vanguard party. Therefore, the masses must

know that the party exists. The party must use all means

available to get this information across to the masses. If

the masses do not have knowledge of the party, it will be

impossible for the masses to follow the program of the

party.

The vanguard party is never underground in the be-

ginning of its existence, because this would limit its ef-

fectiveness and educational processes. How can you

teach people if the people do not know and respect you?

The party must exist above ground as long as the dog

power structure will allow, and hopefully when the party

is forced to go underground the message of the party will

alrearly. have been put across to the people. The vanguard

party's activities on the surface will necessarily be short-

lived.

157

HH 55178. DocId:32989647 Page 581

## Page 582

This is why it is so important that the party make a

tremendous impact upon the people before it is driven into

secrecy.

At this time, the people know the party exists, and

they will seck out further information on the activities of

this underground party.

Many would-be revolutinaries work under the falla-

cious illusion that the vanguard party is to be a secret

organization that the power structure knows nothing about,

and the masses know nothing about, except for occasional

letters that come to their homes by night. Underground

parties cannot distribute leatlets announcing an under-

ground meeting.

These are contradictions and inconsis-

tencies of the so-called revolutionaries. The so-called

revolutionaries are in fact afraid of the very danger that

they are advocating for the people. These so-called revo-

lutionaries want the people to say what they themseless

are afraid to say, and the peuple to dó

what they them-

selves are afraid to do.

This makes the su-called revolu

tionary a coward and a hypocrite.

If these imposters would investigate the history of

revolution, they would see that the vanguard group always

starts out above ground and is later driven underground

by the aggressor. The Cuban Revolution exemplifies this

fact; when Fidel Castro started to resist the butcher

Batista and the American running dogs, he started by

speaking on the campus of the University of Havana in

public. He was later driven to the illls. His impact upon

the dispossessed people of Cuba was very greatyand re-

respect. When he went into secrecy,

Cuban people searched him out. People went to the hills

him and his band of twelve. Castro handled the

revolutionary struggle correctly. If the Chinese Revolu-

tion is investigated, it will be seen that the Communist &

Party was quite on the surface so that they would be able

to muster support from the masses.

There are many

areas one can read about to learn the correct approach,

such as the revolution in Kenya, the Algerian Revolution,

Fanon's THE WRETCHED OF THE EARTH, the Russian

Revolution, the works of Chairman Mao Ise-tung, and a

most of others.

A revolutionary must realize at if he is sincere.

"death is imminent due to the fart that the things he is

saying and doing are extremely dangerous. Without this

realization, it is impossible to proceed as a revolutionary.

The masses are constantly looking for a guide, a Messian,

to liberate them from the hands of the oppressor. The

vanguard party must exemplify the characteristics of

worthy leadership. Millions and millions of oppressed

people might not know members of the vanguard party

personally or directly, but they will gain through an in-

direct acquaintance the proper strategy for liberation via

the mass media and the physical activities of the party.

It is of prime importance that the vanguard party develop

a political organ, such as a newspaper produced birthe

party, as well as employ strategically revolutionary art

and destruction of the oppressor's machinery. For ex-

ample, Watts.

The economy and property of the oppres-

sor was destroyed to such an extent that no matter how the

oppressor tried to whitewash the activities of the black

brothers, the real nature and the real cause of tne actvity

was communicated to every black community.. For further

example, no matter how the oppressor tries to distort and

confuse the message of Brother Stokely Carmichael, Black

people all over the country understand it perfectly and

welcome it.

The Black Panther Party for Self Defense teaches

that in the final analysis, the amount of guns and defense

weapons, such as hand grenades, bazookas, and other

necessary equipment, will be supplied by taking these

weapons from the power structure, as exemplified by the

Viet Cong. Thercfore, the greater the military

ion on the part of the uppressor, the greater i purepara-.

the avail-

ability of weapons for the black community. It is believed •

by some hypocrites that when the people are taught by the

vanguard

group to prepare for. resistance, this only

brings the man down on them with increasing violence and

brutality; but the fact of the matter is that when the man

becomes more oppressive, this only heightens the revo-

lutionary fervor.

The people never make revolution. The

oppressors bu their brutal actions cause the resisiance by

the people. The vanguard party only teaches the correct

methods of resistance. Su, if things can get worse for

oppressed

people, then they will feel no need for revolu-

tion or resistance. The complaint of the hypocrites that

the Black Panther Part for Self Defense is exposing the

people to deeper suffering is an incorrect observation.

People have proved

that they will not tolerate any more

oppression by the racist dug police through their rebel-

the black communities across the country. The

people are looking now for guidance to extend and

strengthen

their resistance struggle.

FEAR AND DOUBT

By Huey P. Newton

May f5, 1967

The lower socio-economic Black male is a man uf

confusion. He faces a hostile environment and is not sure

that it is not his own sins that have attracted the hostili-

ties of societv. All his life he has been?

taught (explity

and implicitly) that he is an inferior approximation of hu-

munity.

As a man, he finds himself void of those things

that bring respect and a feeling of worthiness. He looks

around for something tu blame for his situation, but be-.

•cause he is not sophisticated regarding the sriio-cconom-

ic milieu

and be ause of negativistic patentalud institu-

tional teachings, he ultimately blames himsoli.

When he was a child, his parents told him that they

were not affluent because

"we didn't have the opportunity

to become educated," or "we did not take advantage uf the

educational upportunities that were offered to us." They

tell their children that things will be different fuf them if

they are educated and skilled, but that there is absolutely

nothing other than this occasional warning (and often not

even this) to stimulate education. Black people are great

worshippers of education, even the lower socio-economic

Black person, but at the same time, they are afraid of

exposing themselves to it. They are afraid because they

are vulnerable to having their fears verified; perhaps they

will find that they can't compete with white students. The

Black person tells himself that he could have done much

more if he had really wanted to. The fact is, of course,

that the assumed educational opportunities were never

160

₽.

evailable to the lower socio-economic Black person due

to the unique position assigned him in life.

It is a two-headed monster that haunts this man.

First, his attitude is that he lacks innate ability to cope

with the socio-economic problems confronting. him, and

second, he tells himself that he has the ability but he sim-

ply has not felt strongly enough to try to acquire the skills

needed to manipulate his environment. In a desperate

effort to assume self-respect, he rationalizes that he is

lethargic; in this way, he denies a possible lack of innate

ability. If he openly attempts to discover his abilities, he

and others may

see him for what he is - or is not, and

this is the real fear. He then withdraws into the world of

the invisible, but not without a struggle. He may agtempt

to make himself visible by processing his hair, acquiring

a "boss mop", or driving a long car, even though he can't

afford it. He may father

several illegitimate children by

several different women in order to display his mascu-

linity. But in the end, he realizes that be is ineffectual

in his efforts.

Society responds to him as a thing, a beast, a non-

entity, something to be ignored or stepped on. He is

asked to respect laws that do not respect him. He is

asked to digest a code of ethics that acts upon him but not

for him. He is confused and in a constalt state of rage,

of shame and doubt. This psychulogical set permeates

all his interpersonal relationships. It determines his

view of the social system.

His psychological develop-

ment has been prematurely arrested. This doubt begins

at a very early age and continues through his life. The

parents pass it on to the child and the social system rein-

forces the fear, the shame, and the doubt. In the third

or lourth grade, he may find that he shares the classroom

with white students, but when the class is engaged in

reading exercises, all the Black students find themselves

in a group at a table reserved for slow readers.

This

may be quite

an innocent effort on the part of the school

system.

The teacher may not realize that the Black stu-

dents feared (in fact, feel certain) that Black means dumb

and white means.

smart.

The children du not realize that

the head

start the children got at home is what accounts

for the

situation. It is generally accepted that the child

is the father of the man; this holds true for the lower

socio-economic Black peuple.

With whom, with what can he, a man, identify? As

a child he had no permancht male figure wäth hon tu

icontify; as a man, he sees nothing in society with which

he can identify as an extonsion of himself. His life is

buill on mistrust, shame, doubt, guilt, inferiority, rule

something less than a man, and it is evident in his con-

versation: "the white man is 'THE MAN', he got every-

thing, and he knows everything, and a nigger ain't noth-

ing."

In a society where a man is valued ascurding to

occupation and material possessions, he is without pos-

sessions. He is unskilled and more often than not, either

marginally employed or unemployed. Oftenhis wife (who

is able to secure a jub as a maid cleaning for white peo-

ple) is the breadwinner.

He is, therefore, viewed as.

quite worthless by his wife and children. Tie is ineffec-

tual both in and out of the home.

He cannot provide for

or protect his family. He is invisible, a non-entity. So-

?. ciety will not acknowledge him as a man. Heris a con-

sumer and not a producer. He is dependentupon the

white man ('THE MAN') to feed his family, to give hima

job, educate his children, serve as the maid'that he .

tries to emuiate. He is dependeni and he ines 'THE

MAN' and he hates himself.

Who is he? Ishe a very old

adolescent or is hesthe slave he used to be?

What did he do to be so BLACk and i›lu?

country are intensifying the terror, brutality, murder

* and repression of Black people.

At the same time that the American government is

waging a racist war of genocide in Vietnam, the concen-

tration camps* in which Japanese Americans were in-

terned during World War Il are being renovated and ex-

panded. Since America has historically reserved the

most barbaric treatment for non-white people, we are

forced to conclude that these concentration camps are

being prepared for Black people who are determined to

gain their freedom by any means necessary. The en-

slavement of Black people from the very beginning of this

country, the genocide practiced on the American Indians

and the confining of the survivors on reservations, the

savage lynching of thousands of Black men and women,

the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

and. now the cowardly massacre in Vietnam, all testify to

the fact that towards people of color the racist power

struciuse di americ: has but me policy: repression. e

genocide, terror, and the big stick.

'Black people nave begged, prayed, petitioned, dem-

onstrated and cerything else to get the racist power

structure of Amerita to right the wrongs which have his-

torically been perpetrated against Black people. All of

these efforts have been answered by more repression,

deceit, and hypocrisy. As the aggression of the racist

American government escalates in Vietnam, the police

agencies uf America escalate the repression of Black

people throughout the ghettos of America. Vicious police

dogs, cattle prods and increased patrols have become

familiar sights in black communities. City Half turns a

deaf ear to the pleas of Black people for relief from this

increasing terror.

The Black Panther Party for Self Defense believes

that the time has come for Black people to arm them-

selves against this terror before it is too late. The

pending Mulford Act brings the hour of doom one step

nearer.

A peaple who have suffered so much for so long

at the hands of a racist society, must draw the line soine-

where. We believe that the Black communities of Ameri-

ca must rise up as une man to halt the progression of i

trend that leads inevitably to their total destruction.

THE BIG INSURE

TITLE:

Major City Police Departments.

Command

Officer Conferences

SPONSOR: Criminal Justice Curriculum (under a

$79,000 grant from Office of Law Enforcement

Assistance (OLEA)

PROGRAM: 15 one-week conferences over a two-

year period--it is "the first project ever con-

ducted in the United States". The first conference

is to be held May 25-30 and is entitled "Recruitment

and Retention of Police Personnel". (This certainly

sounds innocent enough; take the example of the

Cakland Police Dept. They use the most modern,

computerized psychogical and sociological testing

methods to duplicate exactly the racist pigs they now

have. Oakland then retains them with the highest

wage scale and fringe benefits in the country (even

3 better than Chicago). That's real progress ask Cakland

Panthers Huey Newton, Bobby Hutton or Eldridge Cleaver.)

PARTICIPANTS: Command-level offirers from the nation's

32 largest cities.

LCCATION: University of Illinois at Chicago Circle: the

conferences

are

to be located in Chicago because this

location is "geographically centrally located an ideal base

for criminal justice training." Chicago also happens to be

the home of "Shoot to Kill" Daley and the most computerized

and motorized Pig Dept. and one of the most victimized

and brutalized black and Latin communities insthe country.

DIRECTOR: Richard A. Wild, a small-town police chief from

Michigan who concluded his Masters paper at Michigan

State University's Police School with the recommendation

that

wist shouiu start teaching required

Poubses in

(1) police pursuit driving

(2y riot and crowd control •

(3) firearms training in all police weapons

JUSTIFICATION: The director of the program states that

"UICC has acknowledged its role as

an urban center

university with a responsibility to assist in the solution

of urban problems". In reality, the University, does not

feel a responsibility to serve the people of the community,

but the racist power structure. The solution of urban

problems can mean anything from a radical restructuring

of our society to genocide against the black community.

Given that the racist power structure hasn't yet made

a serious effort to solve the most serious problems und

that in many ways the

maintenance of their power

depends on the continued existence of these pioblems.

the first alternative seems unlikely, Given the nature of

Gas Al The MaT

merted against the blard commandy, the screwd leslate

What Police Institutes Are About

cognisito

because large numbers of black, brown and white people are understanding what this country

and the pigs are all

about. The more we understand, the harder we fight. And the harder

we fight, the greater is the threat to the political, economic and social control of this country

by the racist

power structure. And when the people in power feel threatened they respond

in the only way they can— with forge and violence.

As the number of black rebellions, campus revolts, labor strikes, welfare marches and

sit-ins, rent strikes, etc., increase, the power structure alid its pigs become increasingly

incapable of stopping the people and are forced to develop newer, more sophisticated methods

to control them.

That is what police institutes like the one at the l'niversity of Illinois at

Chicago Circle and the one on police technology at IlT are all about.

"Just Doin' My Job"

We often hear about how the cop is "just doing his jub". That's certainly true enough;

but what exactly is his "job"? The actions of the police in the black and brown communities

make that clear. Try telling any ghetto dweller that the police are in his community to protect

the people. He knows that is a lie-they are there to protect private property, to function as

an "occuusing army" to protect the property of the outside —generally white-businessman.

When the

"showdown" between property and people's lives comes the pigs will always side

cost of human lives.

Pigs serve three

repressive functions in what we will call the black and brown internal

colonies. This is not to say that the pigs are not repressive in white neighborhoeds; the brutal

attachs on white youth-students, dropouts, gang kids, and us an increasing eltent while

workers-should

dispel that idea. The pigs function

a similar manner in

neighborhoods but it is obvious that the repression brought down on the black and brown

communities is not only mure Intense siven the nature of this racist society, but it is of

174

HH 55178 - DocId: 32989647

Page 598

## Page 599

5 a qualitatively different nature from the way whiles are treated.

The police function first to maintain "law and

order"; the law which

the capitalist class has developed to protect its wealth and property and

the order which it

needs to maintain its power. The pigs are the armed

force which is used to "Surve and Protect" the rulers of this country.

Police are assigned to patrol the neighborhords, schools, hangouts and

parks. Any deviation from their ideas as to what constitutes "sood behavior"

is met with brutal force. They occupy and surround the high schools (black,

brown

and white) to keep any opposition to the rutten educational system

from "getting out of hand". letually they act more like guards in a prison,

which is

what the high schools function as.

in the past year they have

increased the size of the gang intelligence unit (GIl) from 38 to over 200.

The GIl' watches, spies on, harasses and intimidates anyone they define

as being a member of a "gang".

Second, pollee act to destroy the dignity and spirit of resistance which

is so widespread in the black and brown commnitics. They vorbally and

physically abuse and intimidate people on the street-men, women, and

young people are forced to undergo constant harassment, intimidation and

coercion-stop and (risk, curfew violations, no standing on corners, women

just walking down the strect.at night humillated or arrested for prostitution.

The street becomes the cops' turf.

The people who run this country are elther unwilling or unable to meet

the needs of the people; they are more concerned with maintaining their

wealth and nower.

The people need and are demarkling:

*equality and an end to discrimination

*an end to the fighting and dying in wars which are fought to protect

the rulers' business interests

*jobs which provide a decent

living

with

program In

Eincoln Park which expels Latin families from their homes and apartments

to be replaced by upper-middle-income white professionals. The pigs have come dosin hard

on the Lords as a result of their involvement in these struggles. Cha Cha Jimenez, president

of the YIO, has been arrested at least 10 times In the past few months on charges ranging

from disorderly conduct to curfew violations to mob action. Lords are continually harassed

on the streets by the pigs.

We occasionally hear it said that the fault lles with the individual policeman, and that he

needs to be

"educated".

But the hatred for the police comes not as a resull of the actions

of the individual cop but as a response to the functions (outlined above) which the police play.

Those of us who were in the park during the Convention this summer or who live in black

or Spanish communities know that it doesn't matter if a cop is a PhD or a grade school

dropout because once he puts on the uniform, he begins to "do his job".

The police have not

acquired any new functions; they have historically been tools of the

ruling class. They helped the slaveowners to keep the slaves "in their place" and prevented

slave rebellions. They served the industrial busses and robber barons, men like Jay Gould

and Andrew Carnegie, In breaking strikes-stopping picket lines, protecting scabs and

brutally beating, sometimes killing, striking men and

women. They heiped the company

owners during the thirties when working men and somen lought for unions and a decen

standard of living. Even today they help to suppress wildcat strikes.

WHAT TO DO

It should be clear that the police institute will not in any

way benefit the biack. and: Latin communities, the working

people or the youth of this country; will not in any way help to

solve the serious problems we face-racial 'inequality,

imperialist wars, poverty. In fact, by emphasizing a policy of

overwhelming police power and continued repression it may

aggravate the problems.

We must expose and educate people to understand the role

of this institute and the pigs. We must demand thats this

institute be stopped.

While we demand that the police institute get off the Chicago

Circle campus, it is not because we see the University as

some sort of

"ivory tower" which must besprotected from

vuiside influences. The university--with its police institutes;

war research, military and corporate recruiting, ROTC-is

as much a part of the racist power structure as any other

institution. We want the pig institute off the campus as a first

step to stopping it permanently. If it is moved off the campus

and into the .community we will organize to stop it there.

Cur program should be based on the demand: STOP THE PIG

INSTITUTE.

ticim is that sore onades ignore the major i es und confire their altertin

to minor points wher they make criticin. ihey in not understand l'vit tie rai

task of criticim is to point aut prililical and orgaigitional nisites is to

personal shortamings, unless theis une related to poiitical in orgarijational

The mair method of contection is to stucate ianty mondon, a that i slitica

this end we must: (1) teach arty nonbers to apply the irxist erin ist retuxi

in analysing a polition situation and pursing the class fores, instead of

making a subjective unrysis ari apprrial; (2) direit the attendion of icre

menbers to social and econonic inventigation and ataly, so us to deterine the

that statements in the news media credited lo the victims

Although the Second Anendment to the U.S. Constitution

provides that the rule of the people lu keep and bear arms

shall not be infringed, gun control that does not impair line

efficiency of the stare's active, organised militia (Naleral

hough a person shess all the requirements of the latter he

vill not necessarily he protecied thereby from proscention

In addition to bullét holes In the front bedroom thas

were produced by bullets passing

through the front bedroor

from shots fired in the living.room, there were threa

shot patterns on the north wall of the front bedroom, six

bullet holes in the east wall of the front bedroom, three

bullet holes through the east wall of the closet in the

front bedroom and live bullet holes in a dresser in tho

front bedroom.

A. Two shot patterns in the north wall of the

front bedroom were produced by one or more shotgans

firing shotshells loaded with Number 7 1/2 of 9 siot.

These patterns were 47" and 56"' from the northias:

corner of the front bedroom and 42" and 31" fro= ta:

floor respectively. The trajectory of these shots

established that they ere fired from the halli

through the open door to the front bedroon.

Pieges

of lead

shot were Iccovered from both holes.

iB. The third shot pattern on the north wall of se

front bedroom was produced by a shotgun firing a siste

loaded with 00 Buck. It was established that sha

trajectory of the shot producing this pattern led Eros

the doorway between the kitchen and dining room

to a point in the east wall of the dining room zaa=

the northeast corner, 14 1/4" from the ceiling,

passing, through the wall into and through the

plasterboard portion of the closet above the

closet entrance opening, to the north wall of ste

front bedroom. The pattern on the north wall di she

front bedroom was 80 1/2' above the £100r levai.

Pieces of lead shot were recovered.

C. Six bullet holes In the east wall of the freas

bedroom were produced by shots fired from the

hallway through the open door to the front bedras=.

Five caliver 45 Auto bullets were recovered i==

38

behind those holes.

These were "identified as tar--

been fired irom the same weapon. The trajectories

of two of these shots led to two holes in the cize ci

the open door exposedito the hallway.

D.: Three bullet holes were in the east wall of

the closet in the front bedroom.

The shots

producing these holes were fired from the hallway

through the open door to the front bedioom.

They

penetrated the east-wall of. the closet, went through

the south wall of the front bedroom and

exited into the back bodroom.. The trajectory of one

of these bullets led to the right side o the windoi

frame of the left window in the back bedroom, the

trajectory of another of the bullets led to the

baseboard on the south wall of the back bedroon.

The trajectory of the third shot led to and may haie

exited through the left window of the back bedroom.

Ei: There were eight holes in a sis-draver black

dresser in the front bedroon.

Three 05

these holes

appeared to have been in the trajectory path of

bullets fixed through the south wall of the living

XOOm.

The position of the dresser in the back

bedroom appeared fixed on the basis oi these

trajectories.

The trajectories of four other holes

in the dresser led to shots fired into the front

bedroom from the hallway through the open door to tha

front bedroom.

111. four of the bullets producing

these holes Lodged in the dressei and were apparent:

recovered by previous search.

In the right end of the dresser is a depression

characteristic of one produced ly a bullet ricoche.

Its trajectory could not be established.

4.

In the back bedroon were two shot patterns on the east

wall 74" above floor level. The shots producing these holes

appeared to have been fired from a direction of the door leadin;

The shot patterns are typical of

those produced by buckshot. The area had been previously

explored.but. one-shot pellet romained at the time of the

Laboratory examination of the scene, and-it was removed

for examination.

All other holes appearing in the back bedroom have been

logically associated by trajectories from shot sources fire=

elsewhere.in the apartment.

5. A part of the building at 2335 West Monroe Street,

property next door to the apartment where the shooting

occurred, 'is an enclosure referred to as a shed. This

enclosure is over a porch leading to the back door of the

apartment at 2335 test Monroe Street. On the side of this

enclosure is a shot pattern typical of one produced by

buck shot. The shot producing this pattern appeared to

have been fired from the direction of the right window in i=

Ae. The bullets producing the. forty-two entrance

holes in the south wall of the living room all entered

the front bedroon.

Some penetrated the south wall

of the fron: bedroom traveling though the partitio

and entered the back bedroom:

It was possible, by

plotting bullet trajectories fron the living room

through both north and south wall partitions in the

front bedroom, to establish that ninetcen of the.

forty-two bullets fired into the south wall of

the living room entered the back bedroom.

One of the bullets fired through the south

wall of the living room entered the closet in

the front bedroom and exited through the closet

in the back bedroom.

The shot patterns are typical of

those produced by buckshot. The area had been previously

explored-but one shot pellet remained at the time of the

Laboratory examination of the scene, and-it was removed

for examination.

All other holes appearing, in the back bedroon have bees

Logically associated by trajectories from shot sources fires

5. A part of the building at 2335 West Monroe Street,

property next door to the apartment where the shooting

occurred, is an enclosure referred to as a shed. This

enclosure is over a porch lending to the back door of the

apartnent at 2335 West Monroe Street.

On the side of this

enclosure is a shot pattern typical of one produced hy

buck.shot. The shot producing this pattein appeared to

for harboring a fugitive from justice, in building occunied by

an organization calling themselves the Black Panthers.

Special

Agent in Charge MARlIN W. JOHNSÓN of the Chicago Federal Bureau

a lawful search of the building in which the arrests were made,

Rule 41 (b) of the Federal Mules of Criminal Procedure in

conjunction with violations of Title IS, U.S. Code, Sections

2383, 2384 and 2385.

Section 2383 relates to rebellion or insurrection

against the authority of the United States or the laws thereoi

or in giving aid and comfort thereto.

States,

the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or

delay the exccution of any law of the United States, etc.

Section 2385 relates to willfully advocating, etc.

the overthrow of the Government of the United States and

the printing, etc. of material, and the organizing, etc. of

persons for such purposes.

SA

therefore directed that certain

materials be seized

and preserved as evidence of violations.of

Laws of the United States, possibly being committed in presenca

of Agents,

both as mere evidence and as material designed

or intended for use of which is or has been used as means of

committing a criminal offense (Rule 41 (b)) and material that

conducting this search, the following matters

were considered:

The: arrests were completed between approximately

5:30 a.Mo and 6:00 a.m, and it would not be possible to

preparc detailed affidavits for search warrant and appear

before the U.S. Commissioner, or a District Court judge

for several hours.

The building had been prepared with electrical

devices and with solid steel doors and iron doors and bars

placed over entrances, exits and windows, thusly preventing

any entrance without breaking and entering and with

use of firearins.

Several weapons were present and seized

and it is known to Agents that this organization calling

themselves the Black Panthers has consistently stated that

attempts to search or to effect arrests would be violently

resisted, even with firearms.

That attempts to enter the building had met with

no co-operation of any kind from persons in the buildings

and any future attempts to enter would undrubtedly be met

in the same way, necessitating an armed force sufficient

to effect the execution of a search warrant, thus making

•It

impractical to obtain and effect a search by warrant

on the same day.

Liklihood of destruction of evidence

and removal

of evidence while the paperwork necessary for a search

by search warrant was being accomplished and filed.

Tenseness of the general neighborhood due to

prior racial disorders.

conducting this search, the following matters

were considered:

The: arrests were completed between approximately

5:30 a.mo

and 6:00 a.m, and it would not be possible to

preparc detailed affidavits for search warrant and appear

before the U,S. Commissioner. or a District Court judge

for several hours.

The building had been prepared with electrical

devices and with solid steel doors and iron doors and bars

i placed over entrances, exits and windows, thusly preventing

any entrance without breaking and entering and with

of firearns.

Several weapons were present and seized

and it is known to Agents that this organization calling

themselves the Rlack Panthers has consistently stated that

attempts to search or to effect arrests would be violently

resisted, even with firearms?

That attempts to enter the building had met with

no co-operation of any kind from persons in the buildings

and

any future attempts to enter would undsubtedly be met

in the same way, necessitating an armed force sufficient

to effect the execution of a search warrant, thus making

•it impractical to obtain and effect a search by warrant

on the same day.

Liklihood of destruction of evidence and removal

of evidence while the paperwork necessary for a search

by search warrant was being accomplished and filed.

Tenseness of the general neighborhood due to

priot racial disorders.

which ends wits the following:

"Black men.

Black people, colored persons of

America, revolt everywhere!

The only culture

worth keeping is a revolutionary culture.

Change. Freedom

everywhers. Dynamite! Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the

Digs everynhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing

in the October 5, 1958, edition of "The. Black Panther" is the

statement "

into

bedag at a lounding convention

held at Port Huron, Michigan;

In June, 1962. From an initial ideological posture of

"participatory democracy," the current line of the national

leadership reveals an adherence to Marxism-leninism.

• MICHASE BLONSKY, National Secretary, in March, 1969, called

fog the building of a revolutionary Marxist-leninigt movement.

The progran Of SDS has moved from involvement in civil rights

struggles to an anti-Vietnam war position and linally to

is present advocacy of an anti-imperialist line, linking

up the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America

with the black liberation movement in the United States.

China,

Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as countries which

are

leading the world-wide struggles against United States imperial-

1SH.

On the other hand, SDS

regards the Soviet Union as

an imperialist power

ad does not support the polices of

that country.

felt the coalition existed and would continue to exist only as

long as the BPP felt it could receive some benefit from such a

coalition.

The sources did advise the coalition had deteriorated

because of the refusal in the past of the BPP to engage in any

activity with these

groups unless the BPP received some benefit.

extraction and are principally locatet in an area,on

the near North side of Chicago.

Source further stated that Rush told repre-

sentatives of the Chicago news media an May 27, 1969,

that proof that Hampton is a political prisoner is

indicated by the fact that Judge Sidrey Jones, who pro-

nounced the

two to five year sentence on Hampton, re-

fused to grant an Appeal Bond to Hampion when requested

by Hampton's legal counsel. Rush stated that the same

Judge Sidney Jones

recently permitted an Appeal Bond

for four convicted racist murderers it Cicero, Illinois,

but refused to grant an Appeal Bond fox Hampton, who

was sentenced on an "alleged" conviction of theft of

$71.00 worth of ice cream, which he gave to poor Black

children.

Rush told representatives aí the Clicago news

media that Judge Jones was told by Chicago "racist pigs"

to send Hampton to jail or lose his judgeship.

Rush further advised representatives of the

Chicago news media that the Chicago BIP does not have

any current plans for rallies or demorstrations in connec-

tion with Hampton's sentence. Rush stated an investiga-

tion should be conducted as to why "acist pigs" are

repressing BPP, SDS, and other revolutionaries.

GRENADES, AND BOMBS, ANTI-PROPERTY AND ANTI-PERSONNEL

No. 1.

The very small, home-made grenade is exactly

theasame &

the snall explosive device used to set off

the firebomb.

It Is the CO2 cartridge as described in the

preceediag directions, only instead of using a cigarette

to time the fuse, you can light the fuse and throw it.

This little CO 2

cartridge just as 1t is doesn't do a

lot of damage, but it can be dressed up to become a very

lethal weapon. It can be made into a deadly anti-

personnel weapon or a very dangerous bomb.

The small CO2 cartridge can be drossed up by titling

with 3/4 black powder and 3/1 shot, or needles.

This is

obrioulsy anti-personnel and will ponetrate when the CO2

explodes, but still is not big enough to kill.

It has

certain advantages, however. It can be taped to a window,

even with your hands behind

your back, and leit burning

the trusty cigarezte. Ur it could de upeu

the cigarette in.the fuel tank of a car.

If throun into

a car, it is'guaranteed to bruise the occupants and

empty the car of all personnel in record time. Further,

the CO2 1s so small 1t can easily be concealed on pour

person.

Now, to make an actual grenade, a weapon that kills, the

following can be done:

Take a used, empty aerosol can, pull off the

little plastic spray device, and with a hammer and nail

pound the little plastic nipplo down into the can. Use

a punch or screwdriver with hammer to widen the hole and

make it large enough so that large shot can be inserted

through the hole.

Then fill with 3/1 black powder and

1/1 bullets or small-hoaded nails.

Insert fuse, and

light when ready to throw.

The fuse should be an inch and

a half in length and should leave your hand when it has

burned to an inch.

CAUTION: The explosive force of this weapon is great.

It is even more dungerous than a standard army grenade.

Needless to say, a too-short fuse will result in a

scattered grenade-holder. A too-long. fuse will result

in the person or persons at whom you have thrown it to

have a

chance to thros it back and blow you to fragments.

A guerilla with lousy aim in close quarters can kills

brothers. This thing is equivalent to about 12 shotgun

blasts at once. If thrown into ä car it will blow to

bits the car and everything in it, human or otherwise.

If thrown in the open, it will kill within a 25 ft.

radius and mim within

familiarize yoursell with this weapon by practicing with

a sand-filled facsimile.. Try this, and see how long the

fuse takes. You cannot aiford to misuse this in any

way, as Its a real notherfucker of a wexpon.

To make a bomb use the same principle us for the grenade,

only instead of lighting the fuse and thowing it, you

use the cigarette and set the thing down.

For a strictly

anti-property bomb, you don't need the stot or nails.

Just the black powder. A large amount of commercial

dynamite 1s made with

black powder and that's exactly

the kind of bomb you're building here. With this thing,

the sky's the limit. You can make 1t as big as you ilke,

depending only on the size of the contader, the can

that you use. A large tar-bucket full, for

instance,

would derolish sost any building.

This is a versatile

thing, can be scaled to the size you want.

Used in

_conjunction with gasoline. Or set near my fuel tape or

explosive container, the blast would take an entire

lant and lay it. corn.

Perhaps the greatest advantage

nene is that

all ingradients can be bough legally, at

gun shops, bobby shops even five and tens.

A number of different formulas for a molotov cocktail:

2. one third sugar, two thirds gasoline.

3. one third soap powder, two thirds gawline with a

dash of oil.

4. one third naptha (moth flakes), two thirds gasoline.

(This will result in a primitive napalm.))

wick shoula be soaked in gasoline prior do ignition:

APPENDIX

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther Party

(BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to

organize black people so they can take control of the life, politics, and the

destiny of the black communty. l wils oryanid by Bobby Gorge scale,

BPP Chairman, and Huey P. Newton, BID Minister of Defense. Newton

is presently serving a sentence vi 2 to 15 ycars on a conviction of man-

slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland polite officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further

describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states that the

BPP advocates the use of guns and purrilla tactics in its revolutionary

program to end oppression of the black people? Residents of the black

community are urged to arm memseives against the police who are con-

sistently referred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains an

editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray, which

ends with the following:

•"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping

is a revolutionary culture. Change.

Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!

Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing in the

• October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the statement, "

we will not dissent from American (ivernment. We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations

from the writings of Chairman MAO Tsc-tung of the People's Republic

of China and feature MAO's statement that "political power grows out of

the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck

Avenue, Berkeley, California.

Branches have bech established at

various locations throughout the Unite! States.

Captain Samuels further stated that

during the mock trial, the Maywood Police Department was

under instructions from Mayor Chabala to stayaway from

that trial and not to ve observed in the vicinity of the

village hall.

According to Captain Samuels, Mayor Chabala

indicated that he believed that if the participants of

the mock trial were left alone there would be no trouble

Hampton and the fact that Fred Hampton and his followers

would be orderly, that he (Chabala) would resten if there

In addition, Captain Samuels noted that Black

According to Captain Samuels, Reverend Streitor

the mock trial and Hampton's acquittal and indicated

that the nock trial was a more fair presentation of

American justice than the actual robbery tridl in Cook

County Court where Fied Hampton was previously convicted.

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther Party

BPY advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary

program to end oppression of the black people. Residents of the black

• community are urged to arm themselves against the police who are con-

sistently referred ic in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther"' issue of September 7, 1968, contains an

editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray, which

ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping

is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!

Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction lo an article appearing in the

October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther"' is the statement, "

we will not dissent from American Government. We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations

from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the People's Republic

of China and feature MAO's statement that "political power grows out of

the barrel of a gun."

• The national headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck

of the raiding officers. Johnson attributed the

pellets to non-police weapons "because any policeman

who used birdshot would be laughed out of the station."

The pellets were reportedly found in the north wall

of the front bedroom. A search failed to turn up the

MI. Hanrahan's statement had little effect on

the burgeoning controversy. On the same day the

above article appeared, another per was reparting

- that nine Democratic Congressmen had requested the

_National Conmission on the Causes and Prevention of

Violence to investigate the matter. They asted the

President to extend the Commission for this purpose

and in a letter to the Commission reportedly set out

the basis for their concern: "There were indications

handled by the States Attorney's Office.. States

Attorney Hanrahan was quoted as expressing surprise

over the exemption of his men. (Chicago Sun Times

12/10)

The following day, however. Police Superin-

tendent Conlisk announced that the Internal Investi-

•gations Division had begun an investigation. Director

Ervanian explained that all background information would

be reviewed including "arrest records from the raid,

physical evidence, statements from witnesses, and

photographs of the apartment." He reportedly said it

was too early to tell whether it would be necessary

to require the officers to take lie detector tests.

¿Chicago Today 12/11)

On December 10,

a major escalation of the

intensive news coverage began when the Chicago Daily

News püblished

an account provided by Black Panther

defense"attorneys headlined "panther Story of killings."

In'fertinent part the story set forth the following:

incetosithis arcount was matched in

N.:: the following day's issue of the Chicago Tribune in

apubliched an exclusive detailed account given by the of-

Ificers: "State's Attorney Edward V. Hanrahan made

the policemen available for interviews (tol refute

what he termed al orgy of sensationalism in the press

and on television." The exclusive Iribune story also

contained photographs supplied by Hanrahan and his top

assistants Jalovec and Boyle, "which they said con-

clusively proved the-Panthers opened the battle by

firing a shotgun blast thru the apartment door."

In this story, the leader of the raid, Sgt.

Daniel Groth, said that he and Assistant States At-

torney Jalovec had both received confidential

infor-

mation on December 2, that

a cache of weapons was in

• the apartment. "According to the informants, at least

three shotguns had been observed in

the flat.. Neither,

however, made any mention of Hampton's or Clark's fre-

quenting the martment, Sgt. Groth said."

At 4:45 p.M.; on December

3, according to the

story, "Jalovec obtained

a search warrant from Judge

Robert Collins of Criminal Court, citing the facts

obtained from the informants."

-.In the story, Sgt. Groth told of planning the

raid and

selecting the early morning hours to avoia

an incident and to provide safety for his men and

neighbors: Groth's account of the way the shooting

started was the most detailed one to date:

Then police spotted

a third Panther

member in the room, Ronald Satchel, 19,

of 2337 Monroe

st., who also surrendered.

He also had been wounded.

In both bedrooms, police found

large stores of arms and ammunition. In

itampton's back bedroom, four boxes of am-

munition. In Hampton's back bedroom,

four boxes of shotgun shells were found

as well as shotguns, a rifle, and hand

..guns. Similar caches were in the front

_bedroom, some of it in a flight bag."

soOn the evening of December i1, the exposure of

detailed accounts again increased.. Using a mock-up

Se thẻ

,? apartment built in the States Attorney's office,

a'28 minute televised reenactment was presented

on

WBBM-TV. In the reenactment each officer acted out

and described his part in the raid. The essentials

Were the same as had been presented in the Tribune

exclusive, except that in the reenactment officer

Gorman described how he and officer Davis, blocked from

proceeding down the hallway by Panther gunfire, fired

their weapons (45 caliber sub-machine gun and a 30

caliber carbine respectively) through the living.room

wall"and into the bedroom area.

According to

a Daily

News television columnist the following day, the reenact-

ment was given to WBBM with the provision that "nearly

the entire police version be broadcast without inter-

ruption." He also reported that "other local TV

stations reported they had

been offered the same story

possibility, but news directors there say they

had re-

fused to work under Hanrahan's restrictions."

The media controversy reached a new high on

December 12 when the Sun Times exposed the fact that

_ the picturea. that accompanied the Tribune "exclusive"

had been erroneously described. After visiting the

apartment the Sun Times reporter claimed that the

picture of bullet holes near the kitchen door were in

fact nail holes and-that-the photo purporting to show

-the bathroom door. (proving that the Panthers had fired

from the front bedroom) was in fact a picture of the

door to the front bedroom which had been struck by

police bullets fired through the living room wall. The

State's Attorneys office and the Iribune both acknowledged

the mistake, but no explanation of how it occurred was

provided.

There was also a further development with

respect to the use of polygraph tests.

A front page

headline in Chicago Today proclaimed "Hanrahan Lie Test

Challenge to Panthers."' The story quoted a press con-

ference statement by the States Attorney that he had:

refused

request by the officers to take lie detector

tests "for fear that granting it would suggest some

doubt-on our part."

Me. Hanrahan

was

quoted as

challenging the occupants to submit to such

tests

saying that if they did so permission would be granted

for the officers

to do likewise (Chicago Today 12/11) •

The next day the

same paper quoted Panther leader

Rush as rejecting

the challenge because "I wouldn't

-trust, the people who would be administering the lie

test...and once the police get you and lock you up

in a room, they can get you to say anything they want

you to say."' Rush also repeated his earlier alle-

gations of a planned police murder.

He described how

the police arrived in an unmarked truck full of machine

guns and cordoned off the block. "Like buzzards wait-

sing for the kill,.

Rush concluded that murder indictments should be issued

hagainst Hanrahan, Richard Jaloved and Judge Collins.

In this.capitali

spacially oppressed,

- both

as paticuts and as the lovast paid, hardwocking hospital workers.

Black sionen are used as "teaching material". for medical students to do

surgery on. They are used as "guinea pigs" for the escing of new drugs.

There is no consideration for tha personal dicnity of heclth of the woman.

Obstetrical and gynecological care are given far too little attention.

Routine, unnecessary sterilizations and widespread misinfognation are the

The afternoon session of the conference consisted

of speakers of the Chicago "Conspiracy 7" who had recently

been on trial in Chicago for violating Federal Anti-Riot

Laws and who were then free on appeal of their convictions.

One of the speakers was Ton Hayden of that group, who stated

that racists fears come through in reverse. By way of

example, he said that a person who is a racist and fears a

revolutionary will create illegal acts, what usually happens

is that illegal acts happen against the revolutionary. Hayden

also remarked that if the peace movement is unable to end

the

war within the United States it can never end the war in

Vietnam. He emphasized that a massive educational campaign

must be organized within the United States to bring the

Vietnam issue to a point of action.

Hayden's

talk was followed by comments on the

"Conspiracy 7" trial by the following defendants: David

Dellinger, Jerry Rubin and John Froines.

workshop called for organizing picket lines in front of

department stores in the various cities.

A source has advised that the students for a Demorratic

founding convention held June, 1962, at Port luron,

Michigan.

From an initial posture of "participatory democracy" the line

of the national leadership has covenled a growing Marxist-

Leninist adherence which currently calls for the building of

a revolutionary youth movement.

Concurrently, the program

of SDS has evolved from civil rights struggles to an anti-

Vietnam war stance to an advocacy of a militant anti-imperialist

position.

China, Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as the leaders

Each

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther Party

(BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to

organize black people so they can take control of the life, politics, and the

destiny of the black community. It was organized by Bobby George Seale,

BPP Chairman, and Huey P. Newton, BPP Minister of Defense. Newton:

is presently serving a sentence u1 2 to 15 years on a conviction of man-

slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further

describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states that the

BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary

program to end oppression of the black people. Residents of the black

community are urged to arm themselves against the police who are con-

sistently refcired to in the publication as "

pigs" who shouid be kiliea.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains an

editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray, which

ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping

is a revolutionary culture. Change.

Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!

Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing in the

October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the statement, "

we will not dissent from American Government. We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations

from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the People's Republic

of China and feature MAO's statement that "political power grows out of

the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck

Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been established at

various locations throughout the United States.

erganize black people so they can take control of the life, politics, and the

destiny of the black community. It was organized by Bobby George Seale,

BPP Chairman, and Huey P. Newton, BPP Minister of Defense. Newton

is presently serving a sentence vi 2 to 15 years on a conviction of man-

slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further

describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states that the

BPI advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary

program to end oppression of the black people. Residents of the black

community are urged to arm themselves against the police who are con-

sisiently referred is in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther Party

(BPP) was started during December, 1956, in Oaklana, California, to

organize black people so they can take control of the life, politics, and the

destiny of the black community. It was organized by Bobby George Seale,

BPP Chairman, and Huey P. Newton, BPP Minister of Defense.

Newton

is presently serving a sentence vi 2 to 15 years on a conviction of man-

slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further

describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states that the

BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary

program to end oppression of the black people. Residents of the black

community are urged to arm themselves against the police who are con-

sistently referred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains an

editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray, which

ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere! Arm yourseives. The only culture worth keeping

is a revolutionary culture. Change.

Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!

Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing in the

October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the statement, "...

we will not dissent from American Government. We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations

from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the People's Republic

of China and feature MAO's statement that "political power grows out of

the barrel of a gun."

• The national headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck

Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been established at

various locations throughout the United States.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther Party

(BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to

organize black people so they can take control of the life, politics, and the •

slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further

describes itself as the "Black Community News service," states that the

BPP advocates the use of guns and pucrrilla tactics in its revolutionary

program to end oppression of the black people.. Residents of the black

community are urged to arm themsciven against the police who are con-

sistently referred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther"' issue of September 7, 1968, contains an

editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray, which

ends with the following:

"Black men: Black people, colored persons uf America,

revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves.

The only culture worth keeping

is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!

Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction lu an article appearing in the

October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the statement, "

we will not dissent from American Government. We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations

from the writings of Chairman MAO Tsc-tung of the People's Republic

of China and feature MAQ's statement that "political power grows out of

the barrel of a gụn."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck

ORGANIZATION OF AFRO-AMERICAN UNITY,

INCORPORATED (OAAU)

On June 28,1964, MALCOLM X LITTLE, founder and leader

of the Muslim Mosque,

Incorporated (MMI), publicly announced the

formation of a new, all Negro, militant civil rights action group

to be known as the organization of Airo-american Unity (DAAU),

with himself as Chairman.

This announcement..was made at a public

rally held by the MMl in

the Audubon Ballroom, Broadway and 166th

: Street, New York City.

A printed and published statement of basic OAAU aims read

by MALCOLK X at this meeting indicates that it shall include "all"

people of African descent in the Western Hemisphere, as well as

"our" brothers and sisters on the African continent. Itis patterned

after the "letter and spirit" of the Organization of African Unity

established (by African heads of States) at Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,

in May, 1963.

A recording of the remarks of MALCOLM X at this meeting

indicates that the aim of the OAAU is to eliminate differences

between Negroes so they can work together for "human rights,"

while the initial objective 1s to "internationalize" the American

civil rights movement by taking it to the United

Nations. LITTLE

condemned the non-violent civil rights movement and claims that..

Negroes should be taught to protect themselves, when and if

necessary. The OAAU will sponsor a program for Negroes in

education, politics, culture, economics, and social reform.

MALCOLM X was assassinated on February 21, 1965, while

addressing an OAAU rally at the Audubon Ballroom, New York City.

On April 13, 1965, a confidential source advised that

on March 26, 1965, the OAAU

describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states that the

BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary

program to end oppression of the black people. Residents of the black

community are urged to arm themselves against the police who are con-

sistently referred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains an

editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray, which

ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves.

The only culture worth keeping

is a revolutionary culture. Change.

Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!

Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing in the

October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the statement, "

-=0.

we will not dissent from American Government. We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations

from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the People's Republic

of China and feature MAO's statement that "political power grows out of

the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck

Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been established at

various locations throughout the United States.

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the Students for a Democratic

Society (SDS), as presently regarded, came into being at a founding

conventionheld June, 1962, at Port Huron, Michigan.

From an initial

posture of "participatory democracy" the line of the national Icadership

has revealed a growing Marxist-Lcninist adherence which currently

calls for the building of a revolutionary youth movement. Concurrently,

the program of SDS'has evolved from civil rights struggles to an anti-

Vietnam war stance to an advocacy of a militant anti-imperialist position.

China, Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as the leaders of worldwide

struggles against United States imperialism whereas the Soviet Union

is held to be revisionist and also imperialist.

At the June, 1969, SDS National Convention, Progressive

Labor Party (PLP) forces in the organization were expellea, As a

result, the National Office (NO) group maintained its National Head-

quarters at 1608 West Madison Street, Chicago, and the PLP faction

set up headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This headquarters

subsequently moved to Boston,

Each group elected its own national.

officers, which include three national secretaries and a National

Interim Committee of eight, Both the NO forces and the PLP forces

claim to be the true SDS. Both groups also print their versions of

"New Left Notes" which sets forth the line and the program of the

particular faction. The NO version of "New Left Notes" was recently

printed under the title "The Fire Next Time" to achieve a broader mass

appeal.

Iwo major factions have developed internally within the

NO group, namely, the Weatherman or Revolutionary Youth Movement

(RYM) I faction, and the RYM II faction. Weatherman is action-oriented

upholding Castro's position that the duty of revolutionaries is to make

revolution. Weatherman is regarded by RYM Il as an adventuristic

elitist faction which denies the historical role of the working class as

the base for revolution. RYM IT maintains that revolution, although

desired, is not possible under present conditions, hence emphasizes

organizing and raising the political consciousness of the working class

upon whom they feel successíul revolution depends. Although disclaiming

control and domination by the Communist Party, USA, leaders in these two

factions have in the past proclaimed themselves to be communists and

to follow the precepts of a Marxist-Leninist philosophy, along pro-

Chinese communist lines.

A second source has advised that the PIP faction which

is more commonly known as the Worker Student Alliance is dominated

and controlled by members of the PLP, who are required to identify

themselves with the pro-Chinese Marxist-Leninist philosophy of the

PLP. They advocate that an alliance between workers and students

is vital to the bringing about of a revolution in the United States.

SDS regions and university and college chapters, although

operating under the outlines of the SDS National Constitution, are

autonomous in nature and free to carry out independent policy reflective

of local conditions. Because of this autonomy internal struggles

reflecting the major factional interests of SDS have occurred at the

chapter level since the beginning of the 1969-70 school year.

A characterization of PLP is attached.

answered the door.

This car proceeded around the corner, stopped and

WHITE had ANGRUM get out to watch the house while the rest

police car went in the direction of MACKEY's home. VALENTINE

suggested that the occupants'

weapons be left at Brooker T's

Tavern because the bartender there is a friend of Argo area

Panthers.

However,

the suggestion

It was later learned that WHITE's mother had gone

to the BPP ofiice relating to them

that WHITE was weakening
