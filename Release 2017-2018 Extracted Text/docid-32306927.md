MAURICE ELFRIENNAN, a part owner of the New

Frontier Hotel, Las

vegas. Nevada,

is a very close friend

Of ROSSELLI.

He has been associated in several business

ventures in Las Vegas with ROSSELLI; for example, the

Carver House Hotel and Marina, Inc.

In addition,

infor-

mation was

received

â€¢ from LV 39-C*

which indicated that

ROSSELLI might possibly have some interest in the New .

Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas. LA 4268-C, during the past

several months,

has reported that ROSSELLI and FRIEDMAN

are together at the Friar's Club in Beverly Hills on nearly

a daily basis when FRIEDMAN is In the Los Angeles area.

Information received from other informants indicate that

ROSSELLI and FRIEDMAN associate socially, and frequently

go to dinner and night clubs together.

FRIEDMAN resides in Las Vegas, but comes to Los

Angeles several times each month and on

some of these

occasions, stays as long as several weeks.

When he comes

to the Los Angeles area,

he stays at the Beverly Crest Hotel,

125 South Spalding , unless for some reason he is unable to

obtain a reservation. A review of information concerning his

visits to Los Angeles since about October,

1961, reflects

he frequently is assigned to Room 415, which is a corner room:

on the fourth floor.

If he is not assigned to this room,: he:

is usually assigned to some other room on the fourth floor.
