I renember only that, on the Tsentral'nyy Street (proyezd) side,

there was a very well-know, fanous bar, in a basement -- I remember

this.

But that kind of building there vas before this, I do nut remember;

but in 1953, there was no "Detskly Mir'.

A. ((In English.)) Well,

If you worked there, you rould know exactly what was there.

B. I do not renember.

A. And, probably, if you had worked there, you would have dropped in

there several times.

And that will be my next question.

B. But, please; I am telling you; please - I do not remember what

was there before the "Detskly Mir".

There was some kind of building, but I do not renember what was there.

But, on that side, where Dzershinskly Street goes dow to larx Street

(Prospekt Marksa), there was a bar.

A. That there was a bar there, every dog, all the KGB employees and

all of Moscow knew.

((XG; A and B speak at the same time.))

B. Yes, everyone knew - right.

But I do not remember what there was in this building.

A. Why did they llke to go to that bar?

B. Because there was always crayfish and beer there.

Well, It was an interesting bar.

There were several bars in Moscow.

w-,...

But this bar was called precisely "Bar".

It was in a basement and it had a low celling.

A. Waen did they chango the name, "Bar"?

B. I do not remember; the name, 'Bar", was changed to "Pivnoy Zal

(Beer Hall)"; "Pivnoy Zal" Number Such-and-such, "Pivnoy Lal"

Number Two.

A. Imagine - if you worked in the KGB In 1953, 1051, 1955, 1056,

1957, 1953, etc., then probably every day you walised on

Dzherzbinskly Square from sone side.

B. Certainly.

A. You went on Dzherzhinskly Street from one side or another sonewhere.

B. Yes.

A. You probably passed along Kuznetskly Host' every day.

B. Yes.

A. I can in so way believe that you have forgotten what there was

in the place "Detskly Mir" ((now stande)).

B. I do not remember, I do not remember.

A. Impossible.

B. I do not remember, I tell you I do not remember.

I myself can give you an examole.

Anyone can becone confused.

A. For what reason do you give this example?

This is another question.

We can return to this later.

Well, anyway, what about the Komsonol?

•B. I told you about it absolutely accurately, the vay I remember it.

So, so, so.

A. Nell, what dild you speak about with the Konsonol Comnittee Secretary

of the HYD the first time you saw him?

B. It was not only the Secretary of the Komsonol Committee who spoke

with me the first time -it was olther SOOLOY o KOZ'HIN, one of

A. "ell, what did he ask you:

B. It was about were I was on the rolls, when I entered the consool,

what kind of konsonol tasiss I have had, whether I held a responsible

Komsomol position.

A. One minute, he asked you where you were on the rolls.

What did you tell him:

((Pause)) He did not ask me like that; he asked when I entered;

I told him I entered the Konsomol in 1943.

So, I had had no punishmau:s.

Had I been elected to a responsible position:

I was once elected in the Var East, where I started to work in 1950;

I had been elected in 1951.

I was elected Secretary of the Party organization; this was my only

elective office, but I fulfilled other tasks as a rank-and-file

Komsomol member.

A. Again ... Party or Komsomol:

B. Konsonol.

• Where was I last on the rolls:

I told him I was at the Navy Intelligence Point cn the Baltic, in the

Fourth Navy Fleet.

I was on the rolls there for only a few months.

That else did he ask me:

I do not remember.

He might have asked about my family status, about education....

((XG; A and B speak at the same time.))

A. Well, I will ask a leading question - where was your personal

Konsonol file located when you were working in the Baltic:

B. What Komsonol file:

Here, there is only a personal Komsonol record card.

A.

There was it?

B. I do not know, I do not %now, I can not say.

A. If you were the Secretary of the Konsonol organization of the Second

Chief Directorate, even without knowing where the card had been in

the Baltic area, you would be able to answer this question.

• B. Very roll, I can tell you, of course, according to how it is supposed

to be.

I am telling you, not because I remember - I do not remember;

the

card, of course, should be in the Political Department.

In the Political Departrent there 1s a section, a Komsomol Committee,

which guides all of the Konsonol organizations, all of the primary

organizations in the Fourth Fleet.

But, I do not remember that, and I tell you I do not remember.

A. Hell, when the Secretary asked you where you were enrolled, he had

in nind where your card was; what did you answer him!

B. I told him that I was a Komsonol member of the konsonol organization

of the Navy Intelligence Point of the Fourth Navy Fleet.

That is all.

Do you think that they ask that the card be sent.

Nothing of the kind.

They issue a new one.

A. Nell, are you telling the way it was in fact or are you making this

up just to pass the time away:

B. I am not making anything up.

A. When you say ....

B. Nell, then they should have asked me, there in the MVD, "Tell us

the number of the military unit to which to send for inquiries'.

But no one asked me these things.

A. If they did not ask you these things, how could they request your

card?

B.

I as telling you that they certainly did not ask for the card.

A. How does this conform with the Regulations

B. I do not remenber.

A. We again are confronted with a question - whether, ((as)) you say,

they did not request your card, or you do not remenher.

B. I do not say that they ild not icquest it; I an saying, that they

did not asis me.

A. It means that you were not in the Konsomol.

B. ((In a lot voice.)) I can not say anything nore; think what you want.

A. He will not say this is "think what you want'.

B. I cannot tell you anything nore.

I tell you I am trying, explaining the way I know it; mat I know,

I know; what I do not know, I do not know.

A. To hear a Secretary of a Konsonol organization say that they did

not request the card but issued a new one - this is absurd.

B. Why did I make that conclusion.

Because no one asked me

- neither the girl in the registry group,

nor the nember of the bureau of the Komsomol asked ne anything

((such as)) "Listen ((B's surnane)), let us write down where and what."

A. Hell, it would be logical to ask this; let us assume ....

B. Logical, logical.

In case they had to request my card from the oid place where I was

on the rolls, it would be logical for them to ask ne; this is why I

made the conclusion that they did not request it.

A. Then how could it happen, for example, 1f you came to them

they

accepted you for work in the KGB - we will assume you came to the

Secretary of the MVD Konsonol with the Komsomol card.

The Konsonol card does not indicate tho punishment.

If there are, in the Konsonol card, ten punishnents, then what about

the questions of accepting you for work in the organs of the liVD?

B. The punishments will be indicated in the Personnel filc.

The Personnel file will indicate that you had a punishnent in the

Party or Konsonol.

Indeed it will be there.

A. It will be there, that Is true, but the basic document for konsonol

punishments is the Xonsono). card.

D. The card on the jossonol nember which is maintained on him at the

place where he is on the rolls.

A. 'My question - all of the time, to have been going over it the whole

day - hor could they put you on the rolls of the komsonol without

seeing your komsomol card.

3. I did not just come in off the street.

Look how you are making your judgement - as if it were the Komsomol

Committee accepting me for work.

I already was accepted for work -- this is the work of Personnel.

Now would the Konsomol Cormittee regulate the work of Personnel:

No.

A. Again - you know little about what goes on.

No one says that the Xonsomol Comittee controls the work.

For a man who was just about to leave the Komsonol, the Secretary of

the Konsonol Committee probably will speak to the Personnel Department

about what they think.

They have plenty of their ow over-age personnel ((Konsonol members)).

B. I do not know whether they talked or not = they would not inform me.

A. Had you not been a Secretary, perhaps it would not be worthwhile

asking these questions - because, as a Secretary of a Konsonol

organization, you must know this, because it is dally and routine work.

You do not have to learn the work, lt works itself in.

B. You are confusing se a little bit; you see how it was - I vas the

Secretary of a small jonsonol organization.

It 15 just additional work.

There are kossonol Secretaries mo make It leir profession.

A. I have already said that 1f you vere just a Secretary

....

B. This, I would have to know about party - Konsool wor!: Ilke God.

i. Then, perhaps, I would ask nore questions than I au asking.

Most of that you have said nales it difficult to believe that you

vere a Secretary.

There is no basis to belleve it.

((Long pause.)) Let us assume that you are the Secretary of a konsonol

organization; there are only 15 members; you simply execute the work

of a Secretary, but you have other, operational work.

Then did you find tie for a Konsomol meeting.

B. Once or twice every three months.

1. Nell, again - you are saying this dellberately; right?

But the Regulations state how many neetings there are to be.

Of course, it is not necessary that these regulations alvays be

observed, but someone checks, and the Secretary always is asked i1 a

meeting was held or not.

B. You are making a big issue of this; you are judging strictly

officially, according to how the Regulations are to be followed.

Approach this differently - what is the Komsomol organization:

It is a small organization, just so and so many are in 1t - what can

one do with this small organization.

It is a different thing if it is the Komsomol organization of

Surveillance - it is a huge one.

A. But, as far as I know

....

B. In a large organization, the pot has to keep boiling o indeed, they

u111 require a huge organization ((to operate)) strictly.

But a snail organization

The rost important is Countcrintellirence, then Surveillance.

B. I ais talking, about the konsonol organiration.

A. Hell, wo will say that you do not call the neetings as frequently as

the Regulations call for.

No one will deny this.

But, 1f you do not call nectings at all, soneone maies a check on then.

((XG; A and B speak at the sane time.))

... But not one time in three nonths -- this is absurd.

B. Not at all absurd.

I tell you nore than half - 80 percent - of the members are typists

and secrotaries fron other departnents.

How can I pose a question concerning work in a necting of the Komsomol

organization:

I cannot do that.

First of all, the people come from different dopartments.

These are support people, not opcrational.

It is a different thing if it is a Party organization or Konsomol

organization in a departuent, but there were none in the depurtments

of the Second Chief Directorate.

Here, questions closely connected with work are raised.

A. This is all understandable.

B. And here we discuss how a Konsonol member must behave, or, we will

say, a Plenus, a Plenum of the Konsomol of a Plenum of the CC of the

Party has just been held - and this is the talk of the Konsonol

organization.

Minety-nina (99) percent of our talk it about the Plenum and our

agreenent with it.

to could not talk about work, because such is the set-up of the

Somsonol organization.

you have filled in the anieta, you receive a folder for the personal

file.

A. I am not asking you about the folder;

we will come back to it.

B. Why am I telling you this?

On the folder, there is the number of the personal file (XG).

A. You said the anketa has four pages; tell me about this enketa;

the

personal file folder is something else - we will talk about it.

B. The anketa for an agent is completed after he has been registered, and

he is registered alter he nas been recruited, after the recruitment.

Include him in the active agent netrork of the Second Calet

You told me that there are four sides, that in the right corner there

is a place for a photo.

What is this anieta called?

Again, we return to this question.

You were not able to tell ne that the anketa ((for KGB employees)) 1s

called...

B. And I cannot nane this, elther...

((XG; A and B speak at the same tine.))

A. Niell, if a man has worked there for il years, he must have had no

less than 50 agents ....

B. If not more, if not more.

A. More.

B. More.

A. And if, as you said, they thenselves do not complete the anketa, then

you probably filled out no less than

50 anketas, and you must know

this Anketa.

B. Well, part of these I did not fill out, because some of the agents

I received already had been recruited.

A. Well, toll about these antictas.

You vere working, you filled then out, you had agents, you had their

porsonal files: what is the anicta

B. I cannot tell you, I cannot tell you by heart, I cannot.

((XG; A and B speal: at the same tine.))

-

Here is the inkota: in the right-hand corner, the -photo.

It is underlined -- mon the file ropresents: "resident", "agent";

at the same tine, you put in the number of the file, which you already

know.

Then you write in the pseudonym;

then, the surnane, first name and

patronymic; the date and place of birth: nationality; education ....

What else is there.

That is all for the first page...

Residence ... no, no, no, no ... I remember - the residence comes

later.

Now, on the opposite side ... ((Long pause.)) on the first page

... од

the oppositc side of the first sheet

.. •

on the second page... on the

opposite side ((Appears nervous.)) ... by whom recruited:

Then you wite in whether he was recruited on compromising materials

or on an ideological basis; then you add

wnen he ras recruited

Then ... second sheet, third page ... oh, yes, yes - on the first, the

very first page, the place of work

... I already told that ....

So ... well, here, I do not remember what was on top, but on the

bottom - about his relatives ... about the agent's relatives, briefly,

about them - surname, first name, patronymic, date of birth, place of

work, address, telephone; that is all - I do not remember more.

A. The only conclusion I can draw from your description of the anketa is

that a man who has worked there for ll years should not describe this

anketa only in general terms; even 11, as you say, you have a poor

memory, after working ll years there, you are supposed to know at

least ninety percent of this anketa as well as you know your ow

five lingers.

B. I told you about olghty - ninety percent.

A. You even cannot rive a superficial description of it -- that it is

called, etc.

B. I told you -- anictu for a resident or agent.

A. I think that this is not the talk of a man wto has worked there for

Il years and who had quite a number of agents, residents, informants.

and other emplojees - buttho knows the documents very poorly.

Let us go back again to the anticta of the Personnel file.

Can you still not tell me what it was called - the one you filled

out on yourself?

B. Simply anketa, simply anketa.

A. Are you sure you filled out such an anketa'

B. The anxeta, yes.

A. And did you fill it out

• B. Yes, yes.

A. How does it happen that ((you do not knor that)) it does not have

four or six pages, and that it is not called simply anketa".

B. I do not know how it happens.

I an telling you wat I remember.

You ask me, and I am answering you.

A. Consider - a counterintelligence man cannot just sinply say that he

does not remember.

He has worked for ll years - this is his bread and butter; it is

his daily work.

Every day he bumps up against these anketas;

avery day — he cannot

avoid then.

Even if you do not see the agent, you go through his personal file;

11 you do not go through his file, then you go to the Archive to take

a 100k.

You just cannot get around them.

This will be signed by the chief of the departzent - or, in his

Then, it goes to Personnel for the order.

A. You already have told about this in part.

B. Personnel fills out the first page themselves; for example, SAKHAROV

did this, but not the Personnel group headed by KUDREV docs it.

You write only the evaluation; the rest of it is done by Personnol.

All the necessary information is taken fron Personnel Illes, or the

Personnel officer takes it from the Personnel card (uchetnaya Kartochka).

A. Te will not talk about how it is written up, because you are not

There is still another anketa vilich the empluyce hinself completes.

The Personnel file is not complete without it.

Although the anteta is not needed very auch by the liGh, neverthcless

it is provided for by the Contral Comittee of the CPSU, and everyone

Some who are not konsonol or Conmunist Party members also fill it out;

for example, specialir's.

Of course, they do no: fill it out in factories, because there are

no Personnel files there.

checks throu,h the GB but no one cise.

B. Right.

A. There probably it also was ....

B. And there ras no discuss1o? with ne about this in GNU Personnel.

A. When you completed the anieta, you wrotr that your nother came from —

instead of the nobility -- the professional class, and you said nothing

about the arrest of your grandfather.

Probably you had to indicate or give sone esplanation about them; and

the same thing is true about your wife's father - not only about the

fact that he had been arrested, and that you were living with your

wife when he was in prison: if one 1s to believe your storels, you

were present during the arrest...

B. During the search; at the time of the arrest le was not in Moscow;

he vas on a hunting trip.

A. ... During the search of TELEGIN's apartent.

It is very hard for ne to believe that no one talied to you on this

subject and that this did not affect you in any way when you came on

duty with the organs; we must keep la nind that this was still in

1953.

B. Well, just a minute.

Inis might have had some effect, and maybe this is why in January and,

February, they vere dragging it out - they were checking on ne.

kaybe it did have sone effect - they had decided that there was

something in question.

But in March 1953, I do not know

STALIN had died, and IPBULOY, who recomnended me, was in - naybe this

played a part;

I do not know.

A. And mat did you anster to the question about that ind of relations

you maintained with her at the current tine, at the beginnin; of

1053.

B. That relations

I had absolutely no contact with her; I did not srite it, but I

said that I had seen her in 1052 then I case back, because I wanted

to see the girl; I bought sone rits, etc.

And then I say here in the rayon court and the city court; that was

all -- I never saw her after that.

I ansvered that "I have no contact with her."

Because the money, before that, mus sent to her -- I did not taie it

to her; it ins delivered to her by a driver.

After the divorce, the noney officially ins talion iron ay salary.

A. And when was the noney deducted fron your pay - then you began

working in VD:

B. Well, they began deducting the money fron the very beginning, because

the money was deducted fron my pay after the decision of the court in

1952.

A. Yes, but were was the executive order:

B. Nell, that was not given to me, but sas sent probably to the Xinistry

of the Navy or to the military unit where I served.

The money was deducted, and I did not even see the executive order.

A. When you began working in the IVD, what did they deduct for the first

A. Is it logical or not to make such a conclusion -- that a man steps into

a job of the nost inportant directorate of the security organs, in

counterintclligence, the Second Chici Directorate, wich works against

foreigners.

B. So.

A. He coues to the job and he has had no training whatsoever up to that

time with regard to counterintelligence work.

Earlier, he had not worked in the organs of the MiGB of the lVD.

In this year in which he enters, he will have passed his twenty sixth

birthday, and most ilkely he will be neither a Party or kousonol meaber.

His father holds a high position, but the MGD has sose lind of a dirty

file on him.

His nother is of noble origin; his grandfather died in prison as a

Trotskyite.

He was narried to the daughter of a general then in prison.

Well, tell me, as a counterintelligence officer - is it logical or not

to accept hin for wor: in counterintelligence'

Do you think SIUDNYAKOV or GRIBAVOY or the Deputy Minister or the

Chief uf Personnel Directorate - even if KOBULOV has recommended him

would raise a hand to sign papers accepting him for work.

B. I do not know wether this would raise a hand... or on what basis.

This man did not just come in off the street; he was already working

in the GRU.

On the basis that everything came from the top, that KOBULOV had made

a telephone call, that father occupled a certain position - that 1s

all.

B. It is not as though they were taking a man just out of the institute,

but a man who already had been cheered; and the GRU checks through the

MGB -- you just spoise about that - through the iGB.

In March, KOBULOV could have - if he were interested - had ((B's

And what could SHURVYAKOV, GRIBANOV and FEDOTOV say?

They would not stand there with open mouths.

A. If you worked there, you should know GRIBANOY, FEDOTOV and SHUBNYAKOY

you had marrled.

B.

((Pause)) I rcuember that I requested official leave for three days

to get married.

I do not remenber the details -- wether I spoke about intering to get

married.

I. think that I spoke with GORBATENKO, said that I intended to get

married to so-and-so.

There was one thing I did...

That did I do:

I checked her, unoffivially - because this is not allowed.

Across the roon there was a fellow, the Deputy Chief of the First

Section, named KUDREY, Georgly Yakovlevich.

I told him that i want to get married, that I wanted to check her, that

there may be sone incrininating naterial against her.

A. Here we are - completing this anketa for the third tiae.

In the beginning, you had conpleted two copies; then, still more.

Now you were getting married; now how many copies did you complete.

B. I do not reuember, I do not remember.

I know that I completed this anlicta; I did not write an autoblography.

And, in this ankota, I indicated that I had been married and gave the

name of the first wife.

I listed the wife, her mother, her father, her, brother, her sister;

that is all.

A. Then, in the new anketa, in answer to the questions about your family

status, you answered that you had been narried.

B. Married.
