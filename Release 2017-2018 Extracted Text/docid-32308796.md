Former BU 555-C-TE was indicted for Anti-Racketeering -

Hobbs Act on April 30, 1973.

He has since agreed to testify for

the Government and has furnished details of a multi-security

transaction in which stolen securities were obtained from

JOSEPH NAPOLITANO in Boston, Massachusetts, and sold to DANNY

BARCELONE (Phonetic) in New York City and eventually

"to""LEO, thought to be ARIE LEO FROM of Switzerland.

DE CICCO

is still being debriefed regarding this and other matters,

however, at the present time, attempts are being made to

corroborate statements made by him and to conduct other

ede by in and

investigation to develop a prosecutable case.

From a review of several cases in the Buffalo

Division (captioned,

, New York file 15-64331;

, New York file 91-11142; and

87-67310), 1t appears

there are a number of cases in the New

York Division and possibly other divisions which are inter-

related with captioned case.

Initially, De CICCo advised he

was informed that securities furnished to him were obtained

from an employee of a brokerage house in the Boston area, ana,

at the time of initial interview, he reported only one sale of

securities to DANNY BARCELONE in New York City.

DE CICCO noW

advises that between February, 1973, and July, 1973, there were

three unsuccessful attempts to negotiate the sale of stolen

securities and four successful completions of security sales.

Although he was originally led to believe that securities

obtained came from a brokerage house in Boston, he later

learned some or all of the stolen securities in later trans-

actions came from New York City.

All of the stolen securities

sold by dE CIcco and his partner in Buffalo, JOSEPH SANFRATELLO,

were sold to DANNY BARCELONE and "LEFTY" (Last Name Unknown) ,

and all of these stolen securities were reported to have been

taken to Switzerland, where they were to be used as collateral

to obtain loans. After these transactions were completed in

Switzerland, the money would be brought back to the United States

by

settle up with DE CICCO and SANFRATELLO. During June,

DE CICCO was informed "LEO" had been arrested in
