Dear Mr. Hoover:

Since that time I have tried to reconcile the severity of this

action with the delinquencies charged to me and I can only conclude

that because you did not have the full facts concerning my part in

this case, there has been a miscarriage of justice.

Not only is the

10% salary cut severe, but the blot on my career and the reputation

earned in almost 24 years of service as an agent is particularly hard

to accept. I feel compelled therefore, to bring to your personal

attention my side of the

story. I did

not have an adequate opportunity

to do so before my demotion.

I know you are busy but I appeal to you

to review this matter.

I have no other recourse. Outlined below is

a summary of the facts and attached is additional supporting material.

Although this case had been actively under investigation for

my responsibility began as the result of Oswald's. contaet

teletype dated October 10, 1963. Such contact cases were assigned

to my desk. I

have been charged with:

(1) Failure to take action

on the October 10, CIA teletype; (2) Delay in reviewing the file;

(3) Failure to instruct the field to intensify investigation and

1(4) Failure to include his name in a list of dangerous individuals.

I sincerely believe that none of these was either causative or

substantive.

They did not involve violation of any Bureau rules or

policy, there was no deliverate delay and they did not go to the

merits

of the case or affect the outcome.

The same information.contained in the CIA teletype was submitted

by the Legal Attache on October 18, 1963 and action was taken by

if I even saw the CIA teletype before the action was taken by the

other supervisor. In any event, the field was already actively trying

to locate Oswald and the delay did not affect the investigation in

any way. Therefore, It was not a substantive error.

tión of any policy or rule.

Likewise, my failure to fully review the file was not in viola-

I was already somewhat familiar with the

case and the fiéld had it under active Investigation. Furthermore,

such delay was not deliberate but was due to the volume of other work.

Inadequate Opportunity to Defend Myself

On the date of the assassination, although other supervisors

had en interest in Oswald, I was

instructed to prepare immediately

e summary for the Director.

This was done and

thereafter I was

assigned to head up or direct the group of men to review the

material found in the search of Oswald and his residences and the

results of investigation of Oswald and prepare a detailed report

to go to the Department and the White House.

Even in the first

3 or 4 days literally hundreds of communications were received

which required long hours of very intensive work. I continued in

this capacity until January 1964 when I returned to my desk.

On November 26, 1963 Mr. Gale called for interview and asked me

a number of questions about my handling of this case. I was under

considerable tension at the time due to the long hours of work

and the tremendous

job of getting out the report which was due in

a few days. I answered the questions as best I could from memory

and without reference to the file. He asked me to submit written

answers to 4 questions which I did by memorandum dated November 26,196

The file was not available for review but I utilized my ticklers

and prepared the answers as rapidly as possible so that I could

get back to the main job of

getting out the report to the Department

and the White House.

On December 13, 1963 I was

advised that I was being placed on

probation for

4 delinquencies noted in my handling of this case.

On December 19, 1963 I was cormended for my efforts in the preparation

1of

the brief and report which went to the President's Commission.

On March 19, 1964 I was advised that I was being removed from

probationary status.

On September 29, 1964 I was requested by Mr. Sullivan to prepare

for Mr. Gale a memorandum explaining why I had not placed a stop

with the State Department against the issuance of a passport to

Oswald. I submitted a memorandum dated September 29, 1964.

On October 5, 1964 I was

I was not interviewed in connection with the "further analysis"

of the case nor siven any opportunity to further review the case or to

expand on

the brief explanations given on November 26, 1963. 1 therefore

sincerely feel that I was not given an adequate opportunity to defend

myself or present my side of the story before my demotion.
