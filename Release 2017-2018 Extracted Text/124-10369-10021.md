She is currently said to be in havana, cuba,

near house arrest.

She now appears to have more freedom.

She is the sister of the wife of JORGE LUIS ROJAS MENDOZA,

a Merican employee of the Cuban Aviation Company in Mexico City.

Ber brother ALVARO ESTANISLAO PROENZA PROENZA resides in

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and is the subject of an IS - CUBA

TERESA PROENZA waS the secretary of the Mexican

communist muralist DIEGO RIVERA prior to the revolution.. She

became an

employee of the Cuban Enbassy in Mexico City follow

She was described by

her brother ALVARO

in 1965 as 3 "dedicated communist"

and a "slave of the Cuban

The following information is extracted from the letter

"CACHITA" PROENZA PROENZA DE ROJAS, complained that Cuba has

become a police state and that Cuban authorities have the

family "all tied up."

ROJAS and his wife told MEY 197 that

a Cuban communist named JUAN MARINE is a iriend of the family.

On one trip to Cuba, CACHITA ROJAS asked him to look Into the

situation of her sister TERESA PROENZA to see how it could

be straightened out.

MARINE recently visited Mexico "incognito"

and informed the ROJAS that the situation now is extraordinarily

good but that TERESA was once under a death sentence because

she had dealt with LEE HARVEY OSWALD while assigned to the

Cuban Embassy prior to the assassination of JOHN F. KENNEDY.

Her friends interceded for her and her life was spared. ROJAS

told MEX 197 that MARINE warned them not to tell the Cuban

Embassy in Mexico City that he had spoken to them about this

matter.

The source stated that JORGE ROJAS and his wife

do not know how to cope with the present situation.

They

fear going to Cuba and they are speaking out against the Cuban

revolution in a most forthright manner.

played by ROJAS! wife far exceeds any that the source

hoods any nat eng

The bitterness dis-

can recall in the past.

The source stated that some years ago, as best he

could recall, he hearo JUANA LUISA PRocLA, a sister of CACatTA

who died some years ago, telling a similar story of how TERESA

PROSNIZA was somehow involved with LEE HARVEY OSWALD at the

Cuban Embassy.

At the time TERESA was employed at the embassy,

she lived with JUANA LUISA and another sister.

Within the

family it has always been said that JUANA LUISA worried herself

to death after TERESA was ordered to Cuba.

The Mexico City Office has conducted a review of

references to TERESA PROENZA especially those dealing with

. the

OSWALD investigation and it is noted that as set forth in

Mexico City letter to the Bureau 1/24/54 in the OSWALD case

MEX 18 and MEX 19,

both of whom

have furnished reliable infor

mation in the past, reported on 1/13/64 that they had conversed

with ELIZABETH CATLETT MORA, Bufile 100-395934, who told them

of a conversation she held

with TERESA PROeNas, the Cultural

Attache of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. According to

MORA, TERESA PROENZA had told her that OSWALD walked in "cold"

to the Cuban Imbassy and the first person he talked to was

PROENZA. Since PROENZA did not speak English, she turned him

While it is not clear from available information,

it would appear that PROTNZA was able to return iron Cuba

for a visit to Mexico following her dismissal and departure

in 1/64.

By report dated 1/14/65 the CIA reported on the in-

vestipation by the suban government of old line communist

JOAQUIN ORCOQUI MESA.

In this report it was indicated that

TIGRESA PROCNEA had been arrested at her home and was being

held incommunicado.

A review of the foregoing material indicates that

TERESA PROENZA got into trouble with the Cuban government more

as a result of her criticism of the handline of the OSWALD

matter following the assassination of President KENNEDY than

because of anything she did when OSWALD visited the Cuban

Embassy.

zer harsh criticism of nigh Cuban officials (the

Ambassador and foreign Minister) was apparently well known

in the embassy and hardly helped her case.

It fails to

indicate that she did anything for CSNALy

that would substantiate

the remarks made by JORGE LOJAS and his wife to MaX 197 that

TERESA PROBizA had nearly been erecuted because of her activities

during CSWALD's visit to the Cuban Enbassy in 1963.

In the

absence of additional information regardine this activity, no

further investigation is contemplated at this time. it is

noted

that it is not feasible to directly interrogate JORGE

ROJAS

or his wife.

Concerning ALVARO

PROONZA,

MaX 107 reported on 7/2/73 that he had recently visited

the ROJAS family in Mexico City and CACHITA remarked that

ALVARO said he was surrounded by "gusanos" (referring

Cuban exiles in a derogatory manner) in Philadelphia.

(1). With regard to paragraph 3 in which he refers to

his neting with me and Mr. WINSTON SCOFT,

then head of CIA,

Mexico:

I Iirst net Mr. THOMAS, one of the officers amsigned

to the Politienl Bection of the Embasay on 13/17/65, the day

after I took over as legal Attache, when Mr. SCOTT told me he

had recoived a menorandm which he believed I whould see.

wns Mr. THOMAS' memorandun dated 12/10/65.

As originally prepared

that morandu was designated for the Ambrandor, the Deputy

Chief of Mission, the Politiel Soction, Politiel Research (CIA),

and the Central Blographle Department.

He subsequently furnished

this offlee & copy although that dissenination does not show on

the Babasay file copy of his memorandun.

In vlew of the nature

of the information, Mr. THOMS was asked to join Mr. SCOTT and

me in a conference. Since the investigation of the OBVALD case

had been handled by a previous logal Attache, I remained non-

committal about the allegations made by Mias GARRO, but pointed

out the Burenu's interest in that case.

It was aleo pointed out

to Mr. THOUS that the information in his nemorandun vas fr

complete ta mny respecta, including the fact that Mina CARRO did

not pinpoint the date of the alleged party but described it only as

"In September 1963, shortly after her return frow Europe". He

stated that Miss GARRO as extremely reluctant to diseuss the

matter and doubted that she would discuss it with anyone else.

He therefore volunteered to raise the subject again with her to

obtain more details. Ho was thanked at that time for his

cooperation.

Regarding paragraph 5 in which Mr. THOMAS stated

"ho got no reaction fron Mesars. SCOTT and FERRIS rogarding his

memorandum of 12/25/65*.

In view of the expressed interest of the Ambanandor and

the Deputy Chief of Minion who had received copies of ir. THOMAS'

memoranda of 12/10 and 12/25/65 in the factualness of Miss GARBO's

story,

they were advined by memoranda fron this office dated

12/27/65 and 2/33/66, coptes of which are enclosed, that in view

of the faet that Miss GARRO's allegationa had previously been

checked out without substantlation, no further action was being

taken concerning her recent repetition of those allegations.

(3) Regarding paragraph & concerning lir. THOMAB'

Interview with ne relative to Miss GARRO again having changed

the date of the alleged party to the end of Beptember:

The first time

I saw him was in' the presence of Mr. SCOTT.

When he visited

to come in and alt in on the interview. I did not tell him that

Mine CARRO had given the late September date "accurately" when

she had come to the Embassy and made her first report.

I did

tell hin that her nowly revised date was the same time that she

had given when whe came to the Embassy in Novenber 1964 to tell

her story. The investigation conducted at that time, as reflected

In Mexico City letterhead memorandum of 12/11/64, showed that

the late September date was not accurate. Neither did I tell

his that someone else who was at the party had stated that

there were no Americans there.

Frankly, although I had reviewed

the file after this matter first came up In December 1965, I

did not memorize all of the details and I did not recall this

fact which I did not become aware of until my current review

In connection with Nr. THOMAS' recent allertions.

Neither did

I tell hin that I considered the case "closed". I would not

have considered it to be of concern to him whether the case was

closed or not.

I did tell him in response to his inquiry, that

It would not be necessary for him to pursue this matter any

further with Miss GARRO since we had heard her story before and

it had been checked out without being substantlated

and I

therefore considered her story to be a closed issue.

(4) Regarding paragraph 9 in which Mr. THOMAS referred

to Mr.

ALLEN WHITE's alleged statement that the Federal Security

Police' interrogation of the DURANs vas unsatisfactory and

comment, "This transeript may be the source of Mr. FERRIS" bollet

that FLINA GARRO's story had been checkedrout and found to be

untrue":

IN 50953. Docid:32319387 Page 8

## Page 9

MEX 105-3702

This statement 1s uninforned speculation.

I know

nothing about Mr. WHITE's evaluation of the interrogation of

the DuRAN which so lạt

now, had nothing to de with the

story about the allered pirty mubsequently related by lie"

CARRO. My "belief" was based on the investigation conducted

by this office as reported in Mexico Clty letter and letterhead

menorindun of 18/11/64, and the Burenu's concurring evaluation

as set forth in Bureau airtel 12/22/65 and Bulot of 3/15/66.

With regard to paragraph 10 in which Mr. THOMAS

commented that "whereas the FBI has discounted ELENA GARRO's

allegations, the CIA is still considerably disturbed by them":

I an aware of no foundations for this observation that

CIA te "still considerably disturbed" by Man GARRO'a story.

MX. WINSTON SCOTT gave absolutely no indieation of such renetions

to ne

hat on the contrary indiented that he was well aware of

Mime GARBO's unreliability.

With regard to Mr. THOMAS' claim that CIA may not

have pressed further investigation for several reasons including

"considering the sensitive overlap and subtle competition between

two Intelligence collection agencies, it had to yield to the

FBI'& jurisdiction*:

This can only be described as a product of Mr. THCHAS®

Imagination. During the perlod in question, relations between

this office and CIA in Mexico vere maintained on a friendly,

mutually cooperative basts with respect for the authority and

responsibilities of the two parent agencies. The principal

function of CIA in Mezico in connection with the inventition

of the OSAID case was in checking out allegations concerning

possible Cuban aspects through their established sources and

confidential converage. The remaining pointe covered by Mr.

THOMAS under Itens 2, 3 and 4, paragraph 10, are extraneous

to Miss GARRO's story and appear to have been included

gratuitously in his menorandun to the Secretary of State.

(6) With regard to Mr. THOlAS' terminal comment in

paragraph 13 that the records should show that a representative

of a major Anerican publieation has at least some knowledge of

Miss GARRO's story:

This my possibly be & reaction to his separation

from Foreign Servie. According to Embassy sources, Mr.. THOMAS

officer is "retired" niter having been in one grade for the

mxim pertod of time and is not considered qualified for

promotion to a higher grade. This Involuntary separation fron

the Forelgn Service my account for his present attitude which

otheruise is difficult to comprehend.

During the tine siter I took over as Legal Attache on

12/16/85 unt1l his departure from Mexico In 1067, I and other

persomel of this office had very linited contact with Mr. THOMAS.

he was one of various officers assigned to the Politieal Bection

and although he was ontensibly Iriendly, his assignent had

littlo in common with the work of this office and therelore our

relations, both official and personal, vere closer with other

officers in the Politient Section.

The only official contaet

I had with hin was in connection with instant matter. Although

at that time he exhibited somembat of a "deteetive compler" in

desiring to probe into the story recounted by Miss GARRO, he at

no time demonstrated a desire to take over the OSVALD investiga

tion fron the authorised authorities.

Mr. THOMAS' current attitude as set out in his letter

decide how the story given by hiss tanko is to be evaluated.

The concept that every person who passes on to another govern

ment agency information relating to matters within the Jurisdiction

of that agency has the responsibility and authority to review

and evaluate the action taken by that agency is, of course,

untenable.

Further question concerning Mr. THOMAS' Judgment is

raised by item 3 of paragraph 10 of his nemorandum furnished to

the Secretary of State. Any reference to thell

relationship

Is a very highly classified matter and any

revelation to unauthorized individuals concerning such

an arrangement would,

be disastrous

The delicacy of the situation

has recently been greatly augmented by the published Cuban

allegation that one of the officers of the Mexican Embassy in

Havana was acting

Mr. THOMAS, however, included such a highly

classifled reference in

a menorandun which he classifled only

as "confidential"

, contrary to regulations relative to classification

of documents.

While this reference relates to the activitles and

operations of another Government agency and therefore is not of

primary concern to the Bureau, it is nevertheless called to the

Bureau's attention for consideration in evaluating lir. THOMAS'

current allegations.

An additional copy of this letter is being forwarded

for use in the event the Bureau desires to forward a copy to

Dallas which received a copy of referenced letter.
