ReBulet to New York, 1/28/63.

A review of Pittsburgh files, under captione

natter, as well as report supplied by the New York

office,

reflect the following information:

Membership in the Pittsburgh criminal

organization (family) is based primarily upon information

furnished by former PCI|

] (recently released from

the Federal Correctional Institution,

Jacksonville, Fla.,

and presently located Miami, Florida), also PG 640-CTE.

Although these sources have

been closely associated with

SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA and SAMUEL and GABRIEL MANNARINO,

alleged heads of the criminal organization in the

Pittsburgh area, they are not member-sources of "Causa

Nostra"

or even the Pittsburgh criminal organization;

therefore, they are not in a position to identify members

of this organization. Both, in fact, cannot positively

identify the head of the Pittsburgh

criminal organization,

but believe that leadership is vested in SEBASTIAN JOHN

IA ROCCA although they indicate that leadership could

possibly be vested in SEMUBTWANNARINO, GABRIEL MANNARINO

with FRANK-AMATO and MICHAEL GENOVESE

being given certain

considerations. These sources have stated that members

of the Pittsburgh criminal organization are believed to

include JOHN CHRISTOPHER FONTANA, ANTONIO RIPEPI, JO JO

PECORA, ANTHONY "TONY" GROSSO, LOUIS VOLPE, FRANK VALENTI,

JOSEPH SICA and THOMAS ANTHONY CIANCUTTI in addition

to the above-mentioned leadership including SEBASTIAN JOHN

and MICHAEL GENOLESE.

Additional Pittsburgh informants have

member-sources of the Pittsburgh criminal organization.

These sources, however, consider ANTHONY "TONY" GROSSO

as strictly a

large independent numbers man who has

been able to maintain independence from the LA ROCCA -

MANNARINO group.

NY. T-l (identified in New York report dated

12/19/62) states

there are approximately 10 "families"

in "Causa Nostra" outside the New York area. NY T-1

named specific cities which did not include Pittsburgh.

Pittsburgh has previously prepared Anti-

Racketeering reports on all individuals mentioned above

as possible members of the Pittsburgh criminal organization

except for JOHN CHRISTOPHER FONTANA, JO JO PECORA and

THOMAS ANTHONY CIANCUTTI..

In view of the fact that JOHN CHRISTOPHER

FONTANA, JO JO PECORA and THOMAS ANTHONY CIANCUTTI

have been identified as members only by former PCI

a non-member - source, reports are not

being submitted on the latter three individuals. It is

to be noted, however, that information has been developed

and reported in reference to FONTANA, PECORA and

CIANCUTTI in connection with Pittsburgh cases entitled,

"SAMUEL. MANNARINO, AR"; "GABRIEL MANNARINO, AR," with whom

they are associated. .

Investigation is continuing to develop a

member-source that can definitely identify members of

the Pittsburgh criminal organization.
