The following is a translation from German of a letter

which was postmarked at

Stade, N. Hannover, Germany, on an

illegible date in April, 1964.

The return address on the envelope

read "Friedrich Rudolf Buske, 2179 Ihlienworth, Gefluegelhof

Birkenheim (West Germany)."

"Stade, April 8, 1964

"To the Justice Department

of the United States of Ameriça

Washington, (D.C.)

"Gentlemen;

"I take the liberty of urging you to place yourselves

in contact with the Office for the Protection of the

Constitution of the German Federal Government, Office of

the Foreign Ministry in Hannover.

"On March 17, 1964, I submitted to the above office

certain data and information which should prove very

interesting also to you.

They might have a direct bearing

on the causes of the assassination of your President Kennedy.

"The indications I furnished are of great significance

inasmuch as I believe to have dependable information to the

effect that these 'guided actions' will become particularly.

Important in the near future and will undoubtedly occur.

"Friedrich Rudolf Buske"

With regard to the writer of the above letter, the

Bundesamt fuer Verfassungsschutz - (BfV - West German Federal

following comments:

BUSKE has been known to the BfV as well as to other

West German agencies for a long while.

He has been arrested

eleven times in connection with various fraudulent operations

and is presently serving a further sentence of four and one-half

years in the prison at Stade, West Germany.

The data which

Buske referred to in his letter to the Department of Justice

as having been submitted to German authorities was given first

to the Landesant fuer Verfassungsschutz - (LiV - State OffICe

for the Protection of the Constitution), for the state of

which would in any way bear on the problem of resolving the

circumstances of the murder of President JOHN E. KENNEDY Or

the background of that crime.

The Bfv added that BUSKE has,

in the past, frequently furnished information to various German

agencies and officials which information was regarded as un-

believable and the BfV expressed the opinion that there was a

strong probability that BUSKE was attempting through these

current reports to the BfV and the letter to the Department of

Justice to gain

some favorable treatment for himself. The (Bivs)

said that BUSKE's information pertained to alleged operations

and plans of the Fast German Intelligence Service which

information was regarded"as fantastic and had resulted in the

BIV listing BUSKE's name on a warning

Iist of persons regarded

as unreliable information peddlers.

Subsequently, the BfV furnished copies of the following

three documents written in the German language the second of

which is the material referred

to by BUSKE in his letter to

the Department of Justice.

(1) ' A. copy from the Federal Penal Register

(Strafregister) in Berlin - Charlottenburg

#9, Germany, reflecting previous convictions

Of FRIEDRICH AXEL RUDOLE JOHANNES BUSKE

November 3, 1918, in Nepzin, Pomerania.

(2)

A letter dated March 16, 1964, at Stade from BUSKE

to the "Office for the

Protection of the Constitu

tion, Field Office, Hannover" which was a brief

letter of transmittal of an attached "Statement

Written for the Federal Office for the Protection

of the Constitution in Bonn-Hannover Field Office.

"I am pointing it out in this connection because I

feel sure that further such actions are going to

follow.

I remember that, for instance, Treskow told

me who, incidentally, spoke a good German, that Hitler

had been a great teacher,

namely to create unrest as

In Czecho-Slovakla, ustria and Poland, to bring lue

dissatisfaction. And that is what we want.

"I am taking precautions so that, if events similar

to those that came about in America were to happen

again, I shall be able to say that i have already

uttered

a warning.

u)

"I have also informed my attorney-at-law.

I wrote

by the same mail to the Chancellery of the Federal

Chancellor, for I regard it as

irresponsible to wait

meekly and

inattentively."

The BIV subsequently advised that it had caused a

search to be made of the records of the west German Ministry

of Justice and could

locate only two letters written by BUSKE

to that Ministry these being dated September 10, 1963, and

December 12, 1963.

Both contained general' statements

to the

effect that

BUSKE had valuable information and requested an

opportunity to present it.

Neither of these letters made any

reference to the assassination of President KENNEDY in any context.

The Bundeskriminalamt - (BKA - West German Federal

Criminal Police) informed that it had arranged to have BUSKE

interviewed with regard to his alleged information possibly

bearing on the assassination of President KENNEDY.

The BKA

furnished a statement dated at Stade, Germany, July 31, 1964,

and signed by BUSKE and witnessed by

Kriminalkommissar

KOLLECKER.

The text of this statement in translation from the German is

as follows:

"Consequent upon pertinent instructions, there

appears, in the capacity of a prisoner,
