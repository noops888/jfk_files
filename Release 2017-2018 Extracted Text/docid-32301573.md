MOVIMIENTO INSURRECIONAL.

DE: RECUPERACION REVOLUCIONARIO

On December 12, 1963, our source in this matter who

has furnished reliable information in the past learned that

William Johnson, a Untted States citizen, pilot and businessman

who has been previously involved in anti-Castro activities,

rented a twin-engine Beecheraft which is scheduled to be used

in the bombing raid: This airplane is located at Broward

International Airport, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, rather than

at urlando, Florida, as previously indicated.

Some consideration

1s being given, however, to using an Areo Commander alxplane

located at Broward International Alsport instead of the Beechcraft.

Orlando Bosch AvIla, head of the Moviniento

Insurrecional de Recuperacion Revolucionaxto (MIRR), has

indicated that there may be some slight postponement of this

EXCEPT WHERE SHOWN

operation but he has not made any definite announcement of a

change of schedule.
