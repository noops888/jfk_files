whom he is reasonably confident was identified as Mr. WILLIAM

ERICKSON and whom he knows to be the attorney representing

ALDERISIO.

MARINO insisted that he had no knowledge as to the

discussion leading to STEIN's request that BISTERFELDT contact

ERICKSON and consequently would have no idea as to what such

a meeting would accomplish nor did he know whether or not

BISTERFELDT had ever made such a contact.

Mr. MARINO stated that he would make a search of his

personal records in an attempt to determine the exact dates

when STEIN

was in

march 02 his

Denver as well as the date that he was in

Chicago and signed the affidavit and the date when he tele

phonically contacted STEIN and on which occasion STEIN requested

that he contact EGAN and request him to get in touch with

Attorney ERICKSON and that when this information was located,

he would notify the Denver Office.
