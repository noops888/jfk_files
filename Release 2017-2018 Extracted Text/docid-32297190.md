CORNELIUS J. POONAN aka

(00: NEW YORK)

On 4/9/63, NY 3778-C* furnished the following

information:

EXTREME CARE AND CAUTION SHOULD BE USED CONCERNING

INFORMATION FURNISHED BY THIS INFORMANT AND IF THE INFORMATION

IS USED IN ANY MANNER, IT SHOULD BE PARAPHRASED SO AS NOT TO

COMPROMISE THIS VALUABLE INFORMANT.

Informant advised that there were two unknown

individuals in CONNIE NOONAN's office discussing old-time

prizefighters with NOONAN. NOONAN remarked that his brother,

TOMMY NOONAN, had been a good fighter. One of the unknown

individuals who is possibly BILL (LNU) was asked by NOONAN where

he was working and the individual answered "homicide under Frank

Murray (ph)". All three individuals left the office still

discussing prizefighters.

Later, AUSTIN FUREY and NOONAN had a heated discussion

regarding TEDDY GLEASON. FUREY remarked that he (GLEASON) will

probably say make it Wednesday or Thursday because he has not

got "the nerve". NOONAN advised FUREY not to worry about it, that

on how to fill out his "application". The informant was of the

opinion that this application was an application for registration

with the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor.

Both GLEASON

and NOONAN advised ENGLISH not to put down that he was arrested

or indicted and that he should take his chances that he can get

by the Waterfront Commission's "screening"

They pointed out

that if ENGLISH got caught, "that was that"

NOONAN explained to GLEASON that he intends to call

Yale Transportation Company and M & M Transportation Company to

try to get a job for ENGLISH. NOONAN stated "I will call Gene

(ph) and then Pat Everett (ph)". NOONAN made a telephone call and

asked for GENE SULLIVAN (ph). Apparently when he was advised

that SULLIVAN was-not in, he asked for RED BARNEY. It is noted

that RED BARNEY is employed by Yale Transportation Company:

and it is further noted that in March, 1963, NY 1716-C advised

that a (FNU) SULLIVAN, the son of FARMER SULLIVAN an ex-convict,

is a

shop steward at Yale Transportation and is one of JIMMY ALO's

men.

NOONAN was unable to get either SULLIVAN Or BARNEY

and then called PAT EVERETT and arranged to send ENGLISH over

on April 10 to get a job with M & M Trucking Company

From a review of the indices of the NYO, it was

determined that MATTHEW ROBERT ENGLISH is one of the subjects of

NY File 15-26106. Discussion with the case agent of this file

indicates that ENGLISH is due to appear in USDC, EDNY on May 20,

and that FRANKIE DOTO is involved in some manner in this case.

A recontact will be made with NY 3778-C* by the agent handling

this informant and the case agent handling NY File 15-26106.

Any additional information obtained through this recontact will

be furnished to the Bureau.
