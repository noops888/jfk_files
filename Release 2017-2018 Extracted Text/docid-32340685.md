Re Bureau airtel dated 4/25/67â€¢

NY 4498-C-TE advised on 4/26/67, that he does not

know the names of the police officials or

Assistant Mayor of

New Orleans who were reportedly on the payroll of CARLOS

MARCELLO, New Orleans underworld leader. Informant said

that these officials appeared at the Town and Country Motel

at different times while informant was in New Orleans. SAM

DOMINO pointed these individuals out to informant and

remarked as to their occupation and the fact they were on

the payroll.

Informant can not attest to the truth of this

information from DOMINO.

Informant advised he took the trip to New Orleans

on instructions from CARMINE TRAMUNTI When leaving New York,

the informant merely knew he was to see CARLOS MARCELLO

about a job to be done. Informant said that he learned from

MARCELLO

that the job was to rob a New Orleans bookmaker, not

further described.

Informant said

that MARCELLO was to

provide a man to work with informant. Informant never met

this other man.

Informant advised that after staying in New

Orleans a week he was told by SAM DOMINO to return to New

Lork City.

DOMINO told him the job was called off because

District Attorney GARRISON's investigation of the KENNEDY

assassination was causing too much heat.

The above information is not to be disseminated

outside the Bureau at this time.
