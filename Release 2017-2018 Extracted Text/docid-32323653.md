the occupants of the airplane were detained and flown to

and HERNANDEZ got drunk and furnished the Guatemalan pilots

with much untrue information.

HEMMING talked at great length

against U.S. Government officials, U.S. Goverment policy, and

the corruption and ineptness of the U.S. Central Intelligence

On 10/5/63, while the group was lodged at a motel

and visited by the American Military Mission, BUSH, COLLIER and

KAY were interviewed as a group by the mission. HEMMING and

associates were interviewed at a later time by the military;

mission.

During the interview HEMMING was abusive, belligerent and

disrespectful and told the military

mission that Senator THURMAN

had an interest in this matter. (*)U)

Infommant advised that HEMMING and his group were

dressed in an odd assortment of war surplus uniforms, fatigue

suits and boots.

HEMMING wore an orange colored flight suit.

HEMMING and his associates were a disgrace to the U.S. and

created a very bad impression. On the other hand, the basic dishonest

of the Guatemalan Government, coupled with its suspicions and ite

propensity

Imitate a Class B movie, caused a great amount of

Informant claims that the Guatemalan Government is as

dishonest, unscrupulous, and deceitful as is GERALD PATRICK

HEMMING and his associates, and the encounter between the Guatemalan

Government and HEMMING, et al, resulted in

the Guatemalan

Government being out-deceived by HEMMING's lies and insinuations

resulting in

the

‚Guatemalan Government's

deporting HEMMING and

his group.

Informant feels that any responsible government would

have immediately recognized HEMMING as nothing more than an

adventurer. Informant was highly complimentary concerning the

courtesy, dignity and restraint shown by the American Military

Mission during the interview of HEMMING and his group.

For the information of the Bureau, details of this

matter are set forth in a form suitable for dissemination in
