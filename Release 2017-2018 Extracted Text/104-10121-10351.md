1. Alter further consideration of the problems posed

by the investiration of Mr. Robert A. Maheu by Intertel and

s association with that company for

cover, I would like to recommend that a somewhat fuller

briefing be given to Mr. Mullin than originally envisioned

1n my memorandum of 17 March. It seems clear to us that an

Investigation of Mr. Robert A. Maheu's activities In Quito,

as contemplated by Mr. Mallis, will reveal that:

a. I. Jalme Duran, an Equadorian "ten

percenter-type" (who worked closely with

â€¢ 1s hostile to Robert A. Maheu Associates

because Duran belleves himself to have been badly

treated by Robert A. Maheu Associates on a cable TV

project in which he

shared an interest.

b.

The sun of $10,000 was deposited in the

Flrst National City Bank of Quito by Maheu as

kind of

"earnest" money (prior to

arrival. This money was to assure ir. duran of

the continuing interest of Robert A. Maheu Associ

ates in the cable TV project., On the day of his

departure frou Quito,

It 18 important to note Mr. Duran can be

expected to comment in some adverse way on this

subject.

Noreover, we have no positive knowl-

edge if this money was originally Mr. Maheu's,

Mr. Hughes', or some combination thereof.

3.

We believe that Mr. Mullin should be given a more

complete briefing on the relationship between ATA od

Robert A. Mahme onnointes as 1t pertains to

including

current status as an employee of

CIA.

We believe this will encourage Mr. Mullie to handle

a my

Information he develops about

with greater

discretion.

Moreover, should the results of ir. Mullin's

Investigation present him with a conflict between the

Interests of his employer and CIA, Mr. Mullin way be in a

better position to recognize that confliot and consult with

us before either disclosing the information or pursuing a

matter of potential embarrassment to CIA.

Officers in this organization who know and have

dealt with lir. Mullin vouch for the honesty of Mr. Mullin's

w1llingneas to do what he can to prevent unnecessary

by Agency staffers who know him as "not a mental giant,"

they belleve he will cooperate even to the extent of advising

us of the results of his investigations where our vital

Interests may be concerned. It should also be considered

that Mr. Maheu is currently under Investigation 1a Las Vegas

and we have no way of knowing what connection with CIA may

be disclosed by & search of Robert A. Maheu Associates' Illes.

It would be highly desirable to have someone in Intertel on

the alert for matters of concern to CIA which might be devel-

oped by the broad investigation of Robert A. Maheu Assoctates

currently under way.

5.

It 1s my proposal, after consultation with

Mr. James P. O'Connell, DD/PTOS, that Mr. Mullin be briefed

on the cover relationship between Robert A. Maheu Associates

role in the removal of

done by Mr. O'Connell and a member of my staff.

Naturally,

nothing of an operational nature wild be revealed to

Mr. Mullin.
