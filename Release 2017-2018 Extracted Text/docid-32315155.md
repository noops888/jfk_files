MACK indicated. that he thought he had been under surveillance

while on this trip and felt that on the plane coming back

someone had gone through his briefcase.

he has gone by the Magaddino Memorial Chapel at intervals

around 4:00 or 4:30 a.m., and has seen a car with two men

in it apparently watching the chapel. PETER A. MAGADDINO

agreed that the routine of the employees at the funeral

parlor is known. Subsequently they were joined by JOHN

A short time later the

would check on the matter and after

After some conversation, during which

it was indicated the JENSONs were attempting to sell their

home, the conversation turned to politics.

FELL indicated

that the nexi time he might be asked to run for congress

and if he runs he will be elected.
