in the "Minutemen" organization.

One copy of this report is being furnished

Jacksonville and Tampa for information to apprise these

offices re the "Minutemen" in the Miami Field Division.

This report is classified CONFIDENTIAL, since

the disclosure of the identities of the informants

contained therein could be detrimental to the security

of this country.

In an attempt to determine the activities of

"Minutemen" in the Miami Field Division, Miami has opened

psI investigations on two individuals in the West Palm

Beach area who have received this organization's

literature unsolicited and have so advised this office.

As the Bureau is aware, Miami received authority by Bulet

dated January 7, 1965,

to have MM 639-S correspond with

the national headquarters of "Minutemen."

The above

individuals have been instructed that our sole purpose

is to identify any possible local units of "Minutemen",

and no attempt will be made by them to regruit.or..

institute a unit of this organization.

As noted in relet, "Minutemen" literature

was also directed to ROBERT

He subsequently admitted receiving literature from the

organization's headquarters regularly.

Although he

was not hostile, he was not overly friendly, and

appeared to resent being questioned about the organization.

EDWARD JAMARILLO, Jr., during interview,

appeared to be a highly excitable and extremely talkative

individual.

He stated that the large majority of his time

was spent reading "conservative literature."

He appeared

to be extremely disturbed that the Communist element and

the United Nations were about to "take over the United

Stateg."

• KLESMER E. LOWRY, during interview, seemed to

resent being contacted regarding "Minutemen"'

and inquired

why the FBI would investigate such an organization.

He

remarked that Vice President HUMPHREY, during his recent

campaign speeches, made several unfavorable references to

LOWRY was told that the Agents were unaware of any such

in his assumption.

It is not felt at this time that any of the

individuals interviewed possess informant potential.
