Rebulet March 15, 1951, which transmitted a copy of Pittsburgh

letter to the Bureau dated March 10, 1951. This latter requested verifi

getron 02 certain Information sumished by a potential informant, I

It is desired to point out by way of background that theoretically

at least, gambling in Cuba is illegal except in the National Casino which

has been closed during the last two tourist seasons due to labor troubles

with the gastronomical workers union. Despite its alleged illegality,

gambling operates openly with the apparent consent of government authorities

in the following places:

Montmartre Night Club, located in downtown Havana.

Iropicana Night Club, located out in a residential section

of Havana.

Jockey Club, operated in conjunction with the Oriental Park

race track.

Sans Souc1 Night Club, situated on the outskirts of Havana.

Chief source of information of this office concerning gambling

operations during the current tourist season has been one BERNARD GORELICK, +

Rabi No. 477, between Zapotes and Santa Emilia, Santos Suarez, Havana.

GORETICK, is a singer and a master of ceremonies who is known professionally

For the past several months he has been employed as

master of ceremonies at the Rio Rita Night Club in downtown Havana. The

following is sumary of information furnished by ROBERTS over-a-period

of several months.

Gamboing in the first three of the above mentioned places, namely?"

Montmartre, Tropicana and Jockey Club, is operated entirely by Cuban

individuals and there is no "foreign"

capital invested in these enterprises.

The Sans Souci, which was forced to close during the 1949-50 season due to

lack of profits, was taken over by new management prior to the opening of

the 19505l season, was redecorated and opened with considerable fanfare

in December, 1950.

Informant advised that a good deal of money was invested

in this operation by a group of Americans working together with a group of .

Cubans. Informant was able to establish the identities of the following

individuals, both Cuban and American, who are interested in the Sans Souci.
