Committee released a letter publicizing the Dorfman and mob control

of the Teamster bond commissions, the Illinois Reserve Insurance

Company withdrew its subsidiary, sumit, from the program.

The Teamsters then searched for another vehicle for their

bonding program. Through Sol Scawartz and San Francisco criminal

lawyer Jake thrlich, Stewart Hopps, reinsurance expert and alleged

swindler,

(See Appendix A) was contacted. Hopps, a former associate

of Lowell Birrell, has been under indictment in Baltimore and New

"York and has a reputation of gaining control of companies to siphon

off good securities while replacing them with worthless ones. Hopps

contacted several companies but was unable himself to put the deal

together. He did introduce a young insurance man, Charles W. Bray,

to Schwartz, Weiner and Dorfman; Bray in the latter part of 1959

succeeded in establishing a program.

Bray, who inherited an insurance business from his father,

had a small company in Illinois called Central Casualty Company,

the former LaSalle Insurance Company. He also had an agency, Homer

Bray Services, Inc.. Central Casualty was unable to be the prime

underwriter because it lacked the Treasury list certification required

Bray arranged for United Benefit Fire Insurance Company

of Cmaha to be the underwriter. Bray's contact in United Benefit

was a man named Earl ECefry, a vice-president and a director of the

company.

Bray then arranged for reinsurance up to the first $100,000

with the following companies: ri-State Insurance of lulsa._ Oklahoma

(30%) \United Bonding of Indianapolis, Indiana

Fire and casualty

2 Fort Worth, Texas (15%). United Benefit was to

Keep 25% and Central Casualty, Bray's company, was to take 20%.

The excess over $100,000 up to $500,000 was to

be reinsured with

Lloyds of London.

Bray's agency, Homer Bray Services, Inc., was designated

the general agency for the bonding. Bray also set up a local agency,

Inc., incorporated in Illinois in December, 1959, and

Homer Bray Services (Canada), Ita. Schwartz and Weiner gave Bray

the applications that Summit had received before it pulled out.

These applications reportedly represented approximately 80% of

Teamster locals throughout the country and an estimated $1, 000,000

in commissions over a three year period.

Bray arranged a reinsurance treaty for Central with

There have been conflicting reports as to the percentage

shares of the participants but apparently Schwartz and Weiner were

to receive 20% of business they brought. Bray was to get 25% as

general agent out of which he would pay his sub agents, and United

Benefit was to get 37herom the other companies for the reinsurance.

Angelo J. Bianchi, former President of Summit Fidelity,

joined Central to supervise bail bond activities which Central was

also assuming along with the Teamster bonding business. It has been

alleged that this was done in order to give Weiner's agency, the

merican Beil Bond Company, nationwide coverage through Central

Casualty and United Benefit.

The business which should have been a highly profitable

one crashed in approximately two years. Various reasons have been

assigned for the failure - (1) that Bray, relying on Dorfman's

promises to send Central Teamster A & H & Health & Welfare

business, as well as various types of insurance related to loans

from the leamsters Pension Fund, overextended himself in

anticipation of the added business which never came; (2) that,

although the Teamster and bail bonds were highly profitable,

Central wrote high risk auto and taxicab insurance which resulted

in heavy losses; (3) that money was diverted from the company to

Schwartz, Weiner and Dorfman.

In November, 1960, Oxford which had been in Bray's name,

was taken over by Schwartz and Weiner and a special account opene

at the Exchange Bank in Chicago - with which bank Dorfman and the

racketeers have frequently dealt.

In 1961, United Benefit was denied a license in the

District of Columbia reportedly because of a false filing. United

Benefit was shaky and the decision was made to replace it as primary

carrier.

Bray contacted/Resolute Insurance Company of Providence,

Rhode Island, whose president Is Lewie vorganstern:

"to become the underwriter.

In September, 1961, Central Casualty and

United Bonding were canceled as reinsuring companies retroactive

to July 15 and, in November, Houston Fire and Casualty was canceled

and Resolute became the only carrier of the first $100,000.

The agency for the insurance was

,changed also from Oxford

to

Titan Management Corporation - an Iryn Weiner Company.

In December, the state insurance director, Joseph Gerber

(of whom there have been reports of collusion with Dorfman and

Hopps) investigated Bray's firm, Central Casualty. In January,

1962, Gerber announced that the firm was short one and one-half

million dollars and shortly thereafter the firm was liquidated.

According to an anonymous letter to the Department (See

Appendix B for copy), in early 1962, Bray was summoned to the offices

of Bieber and Brodkin, attorneys who frequently represent racketeers,

add was confronted by Phil Alderisio who told Bray that he, Alderisio,

was interested in seeing Bray pay his debts and that Alderisio dia

nöt go to court to enforce them. Alderjelo told Bray that he expected

Bray to pay off debts to the Weiner group, the R.. O. R. agency

(partners are Don Roth 'and Cozie Rothfield) and the Guaranty Bank

the old Southmoor bank) in that order.

Colorado, an associate of Bray's who is now in business with Sam.

Kaye of Miami, was also visited, three days later, in Miami by Santos

aficante who

Toll call studies have revealed that the Dorfmans played

a prominent role in the Bonding Program though nominally not officers

of the companies.

It is requested that Charles Bray and James Eagan be

interviewed and an investigation be instituted to trace the money

that went from the Teamster Locals for bonding premiums through the

various companies in order to determine whether or not the funds

may have been diverted to Chicago racketeers or Teamsters officials.

This investigation should include a determination of the amount of

commissions received by Weiner, Schwartz and Bray - and the identity

of the bonding agents.

The investigation should also determine the recipients

of the profits of the bail bond business since this is alleged to

be in the control, of the racketeers. In that connection, it should I ly

be noted that the Cosmopolitan Company-of. Chicago took over Central's

bail bond businéss

in early 1962 and has since acquired control of

United Benefit Fire of Omaha.

Cosmopolitan officers and directors

Include the names of Volin and Bergman. Determination should be

made if the Volin is the same person who was in the Weiner-Volin

agency and if the Bergman is related to the Bergman-Lefkow agency

frequently used by Dorfman.

Perhaps significant is the fact that Irving Be

Benjamine

the

Illinois state insurance investigator in charge of the Central

Casualty review, has since taken a position with Cosmopolitan.

Toll call records are available in many instances relevant

to the proposed examination.

A chronology of known events in the

bonding scheme is attached (Appendix C).

Potential violation include $ 13(c) of the Welfare and

Pension Plans Disclosure Act, violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001 in connection

with filings required by Treasury and Interstate Commerce Cormission,

and Fhrlich were officers and the assets of which were seized by

California.

It appears that several companies connected with Hopps

Tropical Holdings, Inc.: Hopps said he had no interest

in this company but had borrowed money from it to purchase a house.

The mortgage was held by Republic National Bank and Hopps paid the

company back through the U. S. Marine Company, 44 Wall Street.

(Although Charles Bray had admitted having a 75% interest in this

company, Hopps maintained that Bray did not have any interest in

the company and felt sure that he, Hopps, would know if Bray did

have.)

Hopps has listed his bank accounts as follows:

Copy of anonymous letter to this Department, postmarked

Chicago, Illinois, April 30, 1962, 2 P.M., with return address

Moore, Case, Lyman and Hubbard, 175 West Jackson Boulevard,

Chicago, Illinois.

The Irwin Weiner-American Bonding Agency-

Teamsters Bond-Guaranty Bank-Bray-Central

Casualty-Crime Syndicate tieups

In 1959 the Bond required of the Teamsters Union officials and

employees under the terms of the Magnum-Griffin act was written

by the Summitt Insurance Company•

The broker of record was the American Bonding Agency of Chicago

which is headed by Irwin Weiner.

The Chicago Tribune and other papers claimed that Weiner was a

well known partner and associate of gangsters and insinuated

that Allen Dorfman, Hoffa's favorite broker, and perhaps Hoffa

himself were sharing in commissions estimated at close to

$1,000,000.

The "heat" on the Summitt Insurance Company was too great for

that company's owners to stand. (The Allen Blank-Reserve

Insurance Company group). They cancelled the Teamsters bond

and cancelled the "General Agency" authority which Weiner-

American Bonding Agency held for the writing of bail bonds

nationwide.

Weiner and his associates were desperate for a market.

Charles W. Bray, President of Central Casualty Company of Illinois,

President of Homer Bray Service Inc. (a General Agency) and President

of Oxford Agency, Inc. (a local agency) developed a market via the

United Benefit Fire Insurance Company of Omaha, Nebraska.

Bray's company, the Central, took heavy reinsurance but it could

not "front" the Teamsters Bond because it was not on the U.S.

Treasury Approved List.

The deal that Weiner and his associates made with Bray was that

Bray's Oxford Agency would get the entire commission on the

Teamsters Bond but that Bray would secure for Weiner-American

Bonding Agency a nationwide Bail Bond General Agency for both

United Benefit and Central Casualty at extraordinarily high

commissions (60% on the published basic 2% rate and the right

to keep 100% of anything above the published rate that they

could gouge out of customers).

Bray to have no interest in the Bail Bond General Agency.

Things went as planned and Bray, quite truthfully, testified

before Examiners of the McClellan Committee that he and his

family were the sole owners of Oxford Agency and that Oxford

Agency was the sole

broker on the Teamsters Bond.

The loss record on the Teamsters Bond was excellent and the loss

record on the Bail Bond business was even better.

United Benefit, Central Casualty, Oxford Agency, American Bonding

Agency, Bray and Weiner were all

doing well and 1960 saw a great

intimacy growing up between the Bray and Weiner groups and insur-

ance activities between them expanded to Taxicabs, Financial Guar-

antee Bonds, Mortgage Guarantees, Contractors Completion Bonds, etc.

Central Casualty and the Bray interests needed more capital to

handle these lines and so did United Benefit, whose then President,

Parl Cefry, was an intimate friend of Bray.

Weiner arranged for a $200,000 loan to the Bray group from the

ixchange National Bank of Chicago secured by a Guaranty Bond o

nited Benefit and then later for a $150,000 loan from th

Southmoor Bank (now Guaranty Bank) of Chicago secured by the

pledge of Central Casualty stock..

Bray's Vice President Jim Egan also negotiated a $150,000 loan

from the Pan American Bank of Miami, which loan was also secured

by Guaranty Bond of United Benefit.

The capital of both Central Casualty and United Benefit was

increased, Central's largely by indirect subscriptions from

those who

did the borrowing and United's in part from this

In 1961 things began to go bad.

The Teamsters Bond and the Bail

Bond business remained very profitable from an underwriting stand-

point but the orthodox agents of both Central and United Benefit

began drawing away from these carriers because of the "gangster

types" with whom they were forced to deal.

The loss record on the taxicab business was horrible and the

claims under financial guarantee and contractors bonds, tremendous.

The Chicago Tribune and other papers started a campaign against

Irwin Weiner as being the front for Crime Syndicate ownership of

a Chicago Lard Processing firm "Twin Foods of Illinois".

Court action over the licensing of Twin Foods ensued and the courts

held that "unsavory ownership and affiliations" had been proved.

The Company's license was refused and the papers shrieked about

Weiner and his Crime Syndicate pals--Sam (Tootsie) Bataglia;

Milwaukee Phil Alderesio, Joey Acaro, etc. They tied in the

American Bonding Agency and rehashed

the leamsters Bond situation.

This was too much for the British controlling stockholders of

United Benefit.

In May 1961 they fired the company's President,

Karl Cefry, and cancelled all contracts with the Bray, Central

Casualty, Oxford Agency, American Bonding Agency group.

Bray was able to replace the Teamsters Bond with the Resolute

Insurance Company of Rhode Island, through that Company's

President (Morganstern of Hartford) and to once again get heavy

reinsurance back for Central Casualty Insurance Company.

The United Benefit gave an extension of six months for the Bray-

Weiner group to get a new market on Bail Bonds and meanwhile

Bray's Central Casualty Insurance Company granted 100% to United

Benefit.

All other classes were cancelled by United Benefit.

Without United Benefit's help the Bray group simply did not have

enough resources to weather the storm caused by loss of agency

plant, terrific losses on taxicab fleets, financial guarantee

bonds, contractors bonds, etc. and they rapidly approached

insolvency.

Weiner and his associates saw "the handwriting on the wall" and

began to make moves to protect themselves.

Charles Bray was ordered to appear at a meeting which was Chairmaned

by Milwaukee Phil Alderesio, flanked by several sinister "guards"

(sic!).

At this meeting Bray was instructed to sign his Oxford Agency

stock in blank and turn same over to Irwin Weiner.

There was a considerable display of 48's and a very blood curdling

discussion as to what would happen to Bray and his family if he did

not obey.

Bray signed and at a later meeting held in the offices of Harris &

Burnham, control of the Oxford Agency was turned over to Weiner and

his associates (i.e. control and ownership of the commissions on

the Teamsters Bonds) •

A little later Bray was instructed to appear at another meeting

and this time he was ordered to have the Central Casualty Company.

cancel its very profitable reinsurance of the Resolute on the

Teamsters Bond. (This so that Weiner-Oxford et al would get

more cormission by replacing the reinsurance elsewhere).

Bray, frightened to death, obeyed.

Thus, Weiner and his associates became the sole owners of the

Oxford Agency and the huge commissions on the Teamsters Bond.

Later, fearing an investigation of Oxford, Weiner arranged for

Morganstern of the Resolute to transfer the brokerage to a new

corporation owned by Weiner et al--The Titan Agency.

In December 1961 the Illinois Insurance Department took protective

custody of Central Casualty Insurance Company. In February 1962

Central Casualty Company was put into liquidation.

Bray and his various companies literally "owed everybody" and his

biggest source of income, the Teamsters Bond, had been taken away

at gun point.

Again Weiner called Bray to a conference. Again Milwaukee Phil

Alderisio was the spokesman.

(Bray states that at the meeting there were also present four

elder statesmen of the Crime Syndicate, but he will only divulge

the names to those from whom he feels he may get protection.)

At this meeting Bray was told that Weiner was "stuck" for the

return premiums and outstanding losses on the taxicab lines

placed with the defunct Central Casualty Company as well as for

the return premium on the Teamsters Bond reinsurance (which had

not been paid by the time the Illinois Department stepped in).

Bray protested that the Teamsters Bond commission he had assigned

to Weiner far exceeded the sums under discussion but Alderisio

remained adamant and Bray was told that they didn't dare where or

how he raised the money. The Weiner group must get theirs first-

and soon-or else!!!

They then added that the R.O.R. Agency of Chicago was also stuck

Bray was told that R.O.R. and Guaranty Bank must be number 2 and

number 3 on the payments list, any laws of receivership to the

contrary.

About a week later, former Vice President Jim Egan of Central

Casualty, who was

in Miami, (where he has a local agency) got

a call from Milwaukee Phil Alderesio.

Alderesio called on Egan and told him that he knew that Egan,

Bray and a man named Sam Kay owned a firm speculating in foreign

currency•

He repeated the instructions given to Bray by "the Mob" and told

Egan that if he wanted to live, all money must go first to Weiner

et al, then R.O.R. and the Guaranty Bank. To Hell with what was

due to the Pan American Bank or anyone else.

Later the reputed big time mobster, Santos Traficante called on

Egan and repeated the warning.

Both Bray and Egan are terrified but they will not rush in and

volunteer information as they are afraid of being tailed; in

fact Bray was very cautious and not at all helpful when the

F.B.I. interviewed him.

Now, however, he realizes that his only

safety lies with the U. S. Government

and if proper government

authorities call they will give all possible help.

Bray's home address is 820 North Glenayre Road, Glenview, Illinois.

Egan's home is in Denver but he is staying in Miami at the Wautilus

Hotel and works out of Sam Kay's office, Miami, Jefferson 1-0408.

As to the Teamsters Bond. Two different companies have offered

to write same at a saving of over $200,000 but it remains with

the Resolute because that company has agreed to pay 85% profit

commission to Weiner's Titan Agency and Titan has informed

Morganstern of the Resolute that they are in a position to see

that no losses will be reported to him company.

WETNER-AMERICAN BONDING-ET AL

With further reference to the American Bonding Agency-Irwin

Weiner United States-wide bail bond operations:

Pretty generally all state insurance department officials and

United

• States Governmental department officials with whom I

have talked are thoroughly aware of the fact that the control

of Bail Bond facilities is an absolute essential to the rackets

and to organized crime.

An idea of how important this is may be gained from the facts

which show that to get bail bond facilities Weiner, et al

originally gave up the huge commission on the Teamsters Magnum

From what Weiner and others have stated it seems that the

Treasury Department and the F.B.I. have both extensively inves-

tigated his organization without being able to discover the facts.

The reason for this probably lies in the very nature of the bail

bond business which is quite unlike any other form of insurance

activity.

On bail bonds the published tariff rate differs by state but is

on average $2.00 per $100 of bond granted.

Commissions paid to a bail bond agent vary from 25% to 60% of

this basic tariff premium (depending upon volume, past loss

record, etc.).

Generally speaking the books of both the insurance company and

the bail bond agent clearly reflect these figures, and taxes

are properly paid on same.

As different from any other form of insurance coverage, the bail

ond business is, however, allowed to charge a policy fee o1

service fee and this fee runs anywhere from $8.00 to as high ai

$20.00 per hundred of bail bond coverage.

In some states, such as California, it is mandatory that this

service fee show on the face of the policy but the majority of

states are pretty liberal in allowing the "fee" to be a personal

transaction between a bail bond agent and his client.

Since the insurance company gets no part of this fee, it isn't

very curious and is not interested in the bookkeeping. .

-7.-

In many instances the fee or a portion of same is paid in cash and

for a big agency, such as Weiner's, the cash transactions are in

very large figures indeed.

In addition to the premium and the policy fee most clients have

to put up collateral and here again is a field where the bail

bond agent has many possibilities of making money.

frequently, for a hard pressed client, the bail bond agent will

demand an interest in the man's business, a share in the ownership

of his real property, etc.; or else let him go to jail.

The biggest volume of bail bond business is, however, definitely

directed by those who control organized crime. When organized

crime guarantees one of its minions no collateral is taken by

the bail bond agent and on top of that he splits his policy fee

with the organization directing business to him.

Generally, speaking, each major segment of organized crime has its

own major

bail bond connection and these are usually rather loose

partnerships which are very difficult to trace because what is due

from one partner to another is often settled through some apparently

unrelated business transaction.

(For example, Weiner has boasted, and those who were in the know in

Cuba have confirmed, that for his services to Phil Alderisio--Santos

Iraticante, etc. he

was given a substantial interest in the Deauville

Gambling Casino and the Capri Gambling Casino in Havana. When Weiner

last talked about this he was crying about his loss of a vast fortune

occasioned by Castro.)

The lara business in Chicago, which had such unusual methods of

forcing sales on restaurants, was apparently & similar payoff.

There certainly seem to be tie-ins of importance to the Kefauver

Committee, the McClellan Committee, the Department of Justice and

the Treasury Department.

October, 1959

Bray advised ICC that he was abandoning old pool arrange-

ment in the West and entering new arrangement with Intercontinental

Insurance and Surety Company, which would reinsure 50%. Harold

Weingarden, accountant for HBS and associate of Charles Bray's

father, said Bray lost United States reinsuring arrangements

after

some heavy losses and so turned to Intercontinental of

Panama.

According to the report filed with the ICC, Inter-

continental retains 50% of a maximum individual loss of

$15,000 and does not cede any part of this. (But see Nov. 2,

1959; Underwriters Trust records in New York wherein it is

stated that Intercontinental cedes 50% of their part to

Mediterranean Insurance Company.) The information to the ICC

was that Intercontinental was the successor company to

La Estrella Steamship Navigation and Insurance Company of

Panama City; Bernardo Carames was president. A June 1959

financial statement of Intercontinental was attached showing

total assets of about $ 500, 000.

The ICC was also informed that CC would issue new stock

at three times par with 1/3 going to capital and 2/3 to paid in

surplus.

October 27, 1959

October, 1959

Linquist wrote Hoffa thru Stanley Green of the McClure

Agency in Pittsburgh expressing an interest in writing bonds

for Teamsters and quoting a 3 year premium of $16.87 per $1,000.

Allen Blank said that when publicity broke linking

Hoffa to bonding business of Summit and to Weiner, Blanchi

was called into Chicago and told Weiner should be fired.

Blanchi was reluctant and said that Weiner was a power in the

bonding business and, if fired, would take a large part of

Surmit's business with him.

October 1959

November 1959

with Munich had fallen down. Dorfman wanted Hopps' help

lining up reinsurance.

Hopps said he went to Chicago and met at 9 E. Huron

would help them they would see that it was made worth his

while.

November 1959

Hopps thought the best way to set up reinsurance for IBT

deal was to do it by going "joint account" with some broker or

agent. He called Godoy-Sayan in New York, the big shareholder

in American Security Co.; but the deal fell thru because Summit's

$6.25 per 1,000 rate was

too low. About this time, Schwartz called

him and told him to discontinue his efforts as Styvesant Insurance

Company and United Benefit Fire and Casualty of Omaha (öwned by

George Stewart of Stewart Snith Co.) would supply all the reinsurance

necessary.

November 2, 1959

Agreement between Intercontinental and Underwriters Trust

Company that Underwriters would be trustee of account in name of

Intercontinental; the account would be for the purpose of guaranteeing

payment to US or Canadian claimants for losses and would consist of

300,000;

100,000

in cahs, a check from either HBS or CC;

100,000 certificate of contribution by CC to HBS;

100,000 mortgage note on property in New Mexico owned by Pacific

Service, Inc.

Homer Bray Services (Can) Lta. would be agent per

the October 28th agreement between Intercontinental and HBS (Can)

Itã. HBS (Can Itd. was given power of attorney to issue insurance

on behalf of Intercontinental. Reportedly the $300,000 trust account

was set up in New York at the request of Gerber so that Intercontinental

would be authorized to do business in Illinois.

November 2, 1959

Commercial account opened at Underwriters in the name of

Intercontinental c/o Homer Bray Services (Can) Itd., c/o J. W. York,

56 Sparks, Ottawa, Canada. Initial deposit of $1,167.87. Signators

were James Warren York, Charles Bray, and David D. Whitesell.

Underwriters made cross reference to accounts of Intercontinental

Guaranty and Insurance Underwriters, Inc., 44 Wall Street (Corbett,

Lindhauer, Hopps)

and General Assurance Co., Ita., 44 Wall Street

(McCarthy, Guiness, A. English, et el.)

Armandy Lubaty, Vice President of Underwriters introduced

these accounts and Anglo Canadian Underwriters (May 7, 1957) and

Affiliated Brokers (August 20, 1959). Lubaty thought

it strange

that all companies had one address but never questioned it. Douglass

Winguist was another official who handled the accounts.

met Charles Bray, his attorney Gladstone, and David Whitesell. Bray

was introduced by Loretta Lindhauer, Hopps' secretary.

and Guarantee Company as a

"Pocket" company for a Cuban group, i. e

they do not do general business but function primarily to serve the

interests of Carlos Seguras. Luis Botifol is an attorney who

represents the principal stockholders, Carlos Seguara and Bernardo

Carames (of the Cuban Sugar Institute.)

(Hopps said Botifol had asked him to obtain figures

concerning a trust agreement which had been set up in New York City.)

(It is not known if the Intercontinental Insurance and

Guarantee Company and the Intercontinental Insurance and Surety Company

are one and the same.)

November 1959

Reserve, parent company of Sunmit, pulled Sunmit out of

IBI bonding, apparently because of the adverse publicity. Earl

Cefry, Vice

President of United Benefit Fire and Casualty of

Omaha said the reason was that Reserve had not been able to raise

sufficient capital through the FDC for insurance purposes.

Fraser Wilson of Stewart Smith in Chicago said that after

the Surmit deal folded, United Benefit was no longer using him nor

giving him any details.

Preston White, Manager New York branch Zurich Insurance

Company said that at this time Joseph Henning of Mitchell May Co.,

Inc. contacted him saying he could get Teamster bonding business.

Mr. Pilling, United States manager of Zurich in Chicago turned it down.

Hopps said Joseph Henning then with John C. Paige and Co.

had called Hopps about getting a pool together on labor-management

Hopps agreed to help and would split 50/50 the cormission,

Henning's firm would receive. Henning then called to say the

Summit deal for the IBI was off. (Hopps had heard that after the

publicity on the deal a banker, H. E. Becker, told Allen Blank,

President of Reserve, the parent of Summit, that he would not put

out certain stock desired by Blank if Summit wrote the IBT bonds.

Hopps also heard that Jake Gottlieb, owner of Western Transportation

Company and the Dunes Hotel in Las Vegas and allegedly a close

associate of Hoffa, was going to buy Summit and, if he did, it

would continue to write the Teamster bonds.)

Pursuant to Henning's call, Hopps went to Chicago where

he met with Weiner, Schwartz, Allen Dorfman, Henning: and Linquist

who represented Styvesant and Reliance.

The negotiations broke

down when

the IBT insisted on a $6.25 ceiling to the rate.

Henning and Hopps worked to arrange reinsurance for

Styvesant as direct carrier and contacted Bray and Central Casualty

(In January 1960 Hopps said he did not contact Central Casualty,

later he said he dia) and other companies including Cosmopolitan

Mutual of New York and Consolidated Mutual of New York, who soughi

to get Treasury listing. Thru the Gilbert Bartling and Sons Agenc

of Kansas City, the Pinkerton Agency of Omaha, and the Warner Agency

Of Des Moines, Hopps contacted Iri State Insurance of Tulsa and

Standard Insurance of Tulsa.

Then, Styvesant's home office raised

their commission demands to 422% and the other companies backed out.

November 1959

Then Hopps suggested United Benefit as prinary carrier and

contacted Bray who talked to United Benefit. Bray got UB in and got

his firm in as a broker.

(At one time Hopps also said that Schwartz

and Weiner were the ones who decided on Bray as broker after Hopps

had introduced Bray to them.

On another occasion in January 1960,

Hopps said he did not know who the broker was.) Bray agreed to

compensatesHopps and Henning. Bray then got reinsurance with Tri

State and Houston Fire and Casualty of Fort Worth. (Tri State,

said Hopps, was to give Hopps & of 5%.)

Linguist said about this time he asked Alvin Irenk of

Anka Agency in New Jersey, (Irenk is son-in-law of Abe Lew, deceased

former head of Retail Clerks local in New Jersey who embezzled several

hundred thousand dollars in union funds and was close associate of

Longie Zwillman), to see about reinsurance looking mainly to steel-

workers. Trenk contacted Henning who introduced him to Hopps

(Henning had been referring to Hopps as Mr. Stevens). Linguist met

with Henning and Bray and Hopps, who seemed to be interested only in

Teamster business.

Thru Hopps, Linquist had coffee with Weiner and

Schwartz who wanted to know the maximum commissions they could

receive as brokers. Linquist stated he told them that he wasn't

interested in the business; that, in accordance with underwriting

principles, the Surmit applications were worthless; that in any

event, the maximum brokerage commission would be 20%. He said that

Weiner and Schwartz would not have been satisfied with that figure.

Furthermore, Hopps and the others wanted the premiums paid in

advance and the companies Linquist represented were only willing to

pay commissions as earned.

November 1959

Joseph Henning of Mitchell May said that about this time

he was contacted by an Alvin Irenk about the bonding; there was one

meeting with Trenk, Bray, Linquist and himself. Henning felt Hopps

had brought Bray in and it was Hopps who suggested Henning meet with

Dorfman, Weiner and Schwartz which, because of the bad publicity:

involved, Henning refused to do.

After the Chicago meeting Henning contacted Consolidated

Mutual and Cosmopolitan Mutual of New York re reinsurance, but

neither was on the Treasury list as an authorized surety company.

He went to D. C. to get certification but another plan went thru

first. Henning was to get some part of the brokerage fee for his

efforts; he understood he and Bray would divide 5% and that a

reputable brokerage firm would handle it. Henning felt that a

coverage could be had for 2.50 per 1,000 according to the American

Surety Association bulletin.

November 24, 1959

Joseph Henning of Mitchell May, JI. Company of New York

was contacted by Bray and went to Chicago.

November 28, 1959

Associated Insurers Ita. check stub recording $1,000 to Mars

Earl E. Cefry, Vice President and Director of United Benefit,

Vice President of Stewart Smith and Company in New York called Cefry

to say he heard from Hopps who felt it would be good business.

Ehnes, Vice President of Tri State, Tulsa, Ollahoma, contacted

by Joseph Henning about writing IBT bonds.

Ehnes told him that Tri

State might be interested in reinsurance.

New York and talks to Hopps who had been in contact with Dorfman agency.

December 8, 1959

Hopps goes to Chicago, contacts Ehnes, Vice President of

Tri State Insurance and Earl Cefry of United Benefit Fire and Casualty.

(Cefry and Ehnes have denied any contact with Hopps in this operation

and have denied knowing' him except by reputation.)

December 11, 1959

December 1959

Hopps made calls from Dorfman agency.

Linquist understood that a Major Riddle of Las Vegas had been

interested in buying summit, but that the deal fell through because

Reserve had listed Summit as an asset in a filing they had made and

if they sold the filing would be fraudulent. (Another reasons was that

Riddle couldn't raise the money.)

December 1959

Meeting in Tulsa with Henning, Bray, thnes and agents of

Standard Insurance of Tulsa.

Standard did not go into the deal

allegedly because they were dissatisfied with underwriting procedures.

Irl State took 30% (later received $29,500 of the deposit) and was

going to offer percentages to others.

There werw assurances that

noone connected with the IBI was connected with the program and Hopps

name was never mentioned according to Ehnes. C? was to participate

to 10-15% in view of Bray's efforts in getting business and the

general agent, getting 25% out of the 35% paid to United Benefit, were

to be HBS and Mitchell May, Jr. Company. The companies would share

in losses up to $100,000 with $400,000 reinsurance with Lloyds to be

paid out of premium income.

Ehnes thought the rate was $6.58 per $1, 000 or $16.78 for

3 years.

December 1959

Ehnes told Cefry he wanted a copy and accounting of the

Lloyds arrangement which was being worked out through Stewart Smith

Company and that a 72% figure was mentioned.

The $100,000 would be split among the companies (Iri State

received $29,500) with interest belonging to the companies and after

3 years, the sum was to be credited toward premium payments.

There

would be quarterly statements from United Benefit.

United Benefit requested $100,000 from IBI with bonds

effective 12/15. The deposit was made and the money divided among

the participating companies according to their percentage of

participation the deposit was to be held at least until the end of

the 3 year bonding period.

December 1959

Cefry and Wright reach agreement. Wright received $9,750

as United Bonding's share of the deposit less 22% premium tax.

Wright had agreed to 25%, but only got 108 because Cefry said: United

Bonding was the smallest. United Benefit was to get 35% commission

as earned; expected about 3 million over 3 years, 2 million to insure

losses and I million to be split among companies; all money received

by United Benefit to be divided immediately. (Last stipulation in

copy of letter

and David Ross.)

with excess up to $500,000 reinsured with Lloyds at a cost of 2% of the

total premiums. Vassen said he insisted that (1) application be

to be investigated; (3) the IBI would poice the program and remove

non-bondable officials; and (4) there would be a quarterly meeting

of representatives of all the companies to review the program.

Hopps said he contacted Bray at the Castaways tyring to get

him to reinsure with La Metropolitana (a Cuban company with offices

on John Street, New York City, in a deal unrelated to the bonding.

Cefry of UB and Schwartz were also in Miami. Hopps said he met

Hoffa there, but didn't discuss bonding. (May 1960, Hopps said he

only met Hoffa once and that was in 1956 or 1957). Bray told Hopps

that Iri State took 30% reinsurance and that the syndicate of brokers

that got Iri State would get 5% on this 30%. Tri State agreed to

give 10% participation plus 5% cormission to Merchants Mutual Bonding

Company of Des Moines owned by the Warner Agency, but neither Hopps,

nor the Pinkerton Agency of Omaha, nor Bartling and Sons of Kansas City

Bray was making arrangements to get a $100,000 deposit from

the IBI which Hopps understood was a deposit on the premium for the

International and that the balance was to be paid within 30 days.

Re La Metropolitana, Hopps and Bray did go to Cuba and met

with Godoy's brother-in-law named Arnoldson.

Hopps said he believed Bray's companies have also had

reinsurance business with the Plymouth Insurance Company and

Muir-Bedell of Lloyds of London.

Hopps said that he, Hopps, was also in Florida trying to

get reinsurance from two Florida companies. Hopps said none of his

expenses re the IBI bonding were reinbusred but that usually his

trips were for other business on his own and not specifically in

connection with the IBI bonding.

December 1959

Bray said that Schwartz made Bray's proposal to the IBT

Executive Board in Miami; that the IBI insisted on December 15 date;

that it was Bray's idea to get the 100,000; that future deposits

would be coming from the IBI depending on the number of applications;

that he has not been asked to bond management and union officials undei

the health and welfare funds; that while in Miami, he stayed at the

Fontainebleau; that Hopps was there also and Bray talked to Hopps

about the Panamanian company.

December 16, 1959

1959

Joseph Henning, Mitchell May, Jr. and their staff ended

their connection with John C. Paige and Company and started direct

operations as Mitchell May, Jr. Company. They had Cosmopolitan

and Consolidated as reinsurers, but no leading carrier. Hopps

put them in contact with Bray who agreed as agent of UB to work

thru them on all labor bonds other than IBT.

Hopps was to share & of the May, Jr. Company's commission.

Hopps, trying to get business talked to Dave McDonald thru Phil

Regan, akbright of AlVA, Walsh of Theatrical, Miller of Bartenders,

Cross Of Bakers, and also with Regan's help Keenen of Electrical

and Kennedy of UMW.

Hopps met Gibbons visiting with McDonald at

Ryan's home; Gibbons said he'd try his best to get all Teamsters

under 1 master contract.

Hopps, US Life, UB, HBS were collaborating on bonds for

Bridges and ILWU thru Pinsky and Bercon's Union Insurance Consultants

Agency but UB had no California license so UB and Hopps were out with

no commissions.

About this time, said Allen Blank (KC, FBI report

approximately November 1960), Bianchi resigned and joined CC.

When Reserve failed to sell Summit, they decided to let

it die and only left a few employees to take care of previously

incurred obligations.

Reportedly, Reserve made a deal with Bray to take over

existing bonding without Bray paying Reserve any money for the

business.

Illinois State Insurance Department authorized CC to .

issue an additional 100,000 shares of stock to be solf for

$300,000; the understanding was that Bray would acquire this

stock in a closed sale.

Earl Cefry of United Benefit said that UB was writing

bonds through HBS Inc. of ivanston, Illinois: that UB followed

American Security Association rates: that 25% broker'e

commission would be paid to Bray as it was earned, (Cefry had

had advised it would be split by Bray and Henning as brokers

of record.) and that Bray would pay his brokers 15-20% out of

this; that UB was doing all the underwriting and ordering reports

on all Teamster officials who would be bonded 15,000 or more.

(Peter Zimmerman of the Surety Association of America, 60 John

Street, New York City, WH 3 - 0803 said that a company should

not write a bond totaling $500, 000 without first submitting it

tothe Association and that to do so would be a violation of the

insurance laws; Bray denied that this is so.)

Joseph Henning said he understood that 20% would be

paid to a broker who was not yet named and 5% would be split

three ways among Hopps, Bray and Henning.

At this time Hopps had received no commission for his

part in the IBI bonding (nor had he as of 5/60). He would think

that since he introduced Tri State, Iri State would pay him a fee

with permission to reduce the amount paid to UB. Hopps understood

that UB had done extensive investigating on the bonding and that

some underwriters had flown over from Lloyds. If UB backs out,

(Hopps thought the deal will still break down and he would handle

it.) he had a big New York mutual ready; Hopps had two big companies

applying for Treasury listing. Hopps had no insurance company of

his own, but was a shareholder not a Board member, in many small

companies; be was a reinsurance broker.

Bray in an interview, said that he had first been

contacted in October by Henning who wanted his help in getting

Cosmopolitan and Consolidated on Treasury list; that he read

about Allen Dorfman having the Surmit applications and went

down on his own; that he felt confident he'd get the business but

for no particular reason; that he had met Hopps some time ago

in San Francisco, but didn't know him; that he met Hopps in

Chicago with Henning; that he didn't know Dorfman's connection

and that Dorfman played practically no part in setting this up; that

he didn't know what part Hopps had played; that he thought he

could have gotten the lusiness without Schwartz, but Schwartz got

part of it. (Bray later, June 1960, admitted the above version is

not correct and that he was contacted by Hopps.)

Bray also said that Schwartz and Weiner wanted 20% of

all business they submitted and thatthey turned over several

hundred Summit applications to him.

Bray said that the reinsuring companies were paying

United Benefit 372% and that United Benefit was paying Bray

25%; payments to be made to HBS Inc., which would pay Oxford

Agency Inc. 20% and Oxford would pay

the brokers. Schwartz and

Weiner would probably receive 20% brokers fees for the business

they furnished.

Mitchell May, Jr. Company would receive

approximately 2'% out of the top 5% to HBS Inc. Nothing would go

to the Dorfmans or to the Illinois agency of Summit.

Other brokers were Stewart Smith Company, (this company

owns United Benefit and was counting on getting Joint Council 25

in Chicago), Bud Barnes of Omaha and perhaps Martin Seigal.

Bray stated that the $19,000, CO's share of the IBT

deposit, would not be disbursed.

(But see late December 1959.)

Bray interpreted the law to mean that the bonding

companies had to have a combined Ireasury rating up to $500,000,

but that no one company had to accept up to its maximum rating.

Bray gave the following figures:

Bray said that United Benefit would run credit

to apply for their criteria for bondability. Though

there is nothing in writing bonds, Bray said the

Teamsters had agreed that if a person is not bondable

he would be relieved of his duties.

Bray mentioned that he had one girl working in

office space provided by Teamsters for which he pay $123

rent per month.

Hopps said he met Gibbons on behalf of the bonding

company complaining because the premiums were not being

paid and all the Teamster locals were not participating.

Gibbons said they do not have control over the locals

that people think but they would do what they could.

Bray called Leonard Schloer, Chief of Section of

Insurance, ICC, trying to make arrangements for the

Cosmopolitan Insurance Company of New York to get

Treasury listing.

1959 statement of central Casualty filed with

the ICC showed that Central Casualty had assumed $214,831.93

reinsurance business and had ceded half.

Bray said that Homer Bray Service, Inc. held stock

in Oxford; that Underwriters Irust Co. of New York had

recently purchased stock in Homer Bray Service, Inc., for

$100,000. Homer Bray Service had been selling accounts

receivable to banks for the purpose of making loans. The

$100,000 was to repay loans which had been used to pay

premiums to Iloyds of London.

Central Casualty paid Homer Bray Service $55,000

for purchase of equipment; Central Casualty then sold it

to United States Leasing Corporation; 580 California

Street, San Francisco, California; United States Leasing

then leased it back to Homer Bray Service for $5,000 a

month.

Teamster locals received a letter announcing lowel

rates from Thomas J. Leahy, Leahy and Associates, 6 North

Hanlin Avenue, Chicago, Illinois. (Moil has been received

for Thomas J. Leaby in care of Plasticians Inc., 208 LaSalle

Street-same address as Central Casualty. Leahy said he

was a broker in getting bonds for Joint Council 25 and some

locals that he had dealt with Fraser Wilson of Stewart

Smith Co., and Linguist and Burnes of the Styvesant Co.

Leahy stated he heard about the bonding, contacted Sol

Schwartz and reached an agreement whereby leahy would be

Smith Co. and the bonding of trustees with Styvesant.

Reportedly, Stewart Smith is affiliated with an agent

of Lloyds of London.

Company) under investigation in New York, Baltimore

and San Francisco.

(From page 19 FBI report, Agent John Roberts,

Chicago, November 11, 1961)

United Public Insurance Company of Indiana was

subject of attempted takeover by Cleveland hoodlums,

among whom were Dominick Bartone, Lou Brady, Dom

Lonardo and Don Plitzer. Trans American Security,

their 'front' agency, defaulted in March 1960 and

went out of business.

United Public Insurance

Company assumed the obligations until arrangements

could be made. Allegedly, the Cleveland group was

told by San "Mooney" Giancana to stay out of Chicago

bail business, that it was his territory.

Chicago

bail bondsmen who do approximately 90% of the business

are Ed Morris, Tony Horton and Irv Weiner. Pat Cerone

is a well-known agent of Weiner.

Weiner allegedly is also a jewelry fence. Ed

Morris is tied in with Cosmopolitan Insurance Company

and Bill Rose (associate of Mickey Cohen).

There also appears to be a leak between these

bondsmen and the law firm of Bieber and Brodkins,

reputed ito becattorneys for the racketeers.

Individual bondsmen are forced to work with

them because if one tries to disassociate, defaults

of that bondsmen which had been taken care of "through

contacts" are reviewed.

Bray goes to ICC. New stock issued by Central

Casualty had been completed that week.

Bray told ICC

that it was to private individuals, one to man in oil

business named Ryan.

In order to keep United Benefits 'A' rating

with Best's, Cefry says he solicited 35 agents and

got $126,000 cash representing sale of 12,600 shares

of United Benefit at $10.

Hopps said he had no stock interest in

Affiliated Brokers (see August 20, 1959) but had

placed business with them.

Stockholders are

Edwin J. Ryan, Mexico City, John Kearney, Mexico

City and Luis

Botifol, Havana, Cuba. Hopps be-

lieved his secretary Loretto Lindhauser had put

Ryan and others in touch with attorneys to in

corporate the company in Delaware.

The company

was replacing Anglo-Canadian Underwriters, Lta.

Hopps said he was trying to work out a

deal with Affiliated Brokers whereby he would get

a monthly advisory fee of 51,000; he has receiver

between $2,000 and $3,000 from the company in th

past year.

Hopps acknowledged that he can sign checks

without restriction on the Affiliated Brokers

Account at Underwriters Trust, New York City,

(Most of the checks written by Hopps, amounting

to several thousand dollars, had either himself

or his wife as payee.) He said the principal

account for Affiliated Brokers was in Mexico

and that Messrs, Ryan, Kearney, and Botifol had

authority to sign checks.

Hopps said that the only money he had

received from Bray or Bray's companies, was a.

few hundred dollars to refund his expenses after

the trip to cuba. He said that this money was

not paid directly to him, but was paid by Bray

or one of his companies to Affiliated Brokers.

Hopps said that he had not received any other

Hopps also said he has not received any

money from Intercontinental Insurance and Surety

stock in the Mediterranean Insurance Company, but

did not. (See December 20, 1959) Hopps then stated

IBs Inc. note signed by Charles W. Bray, director

for $150,000 from Guaranty Bank and Irust, 6760 Stoney Island Ave.,

Chicago (formerly the Southmoor bank; this is the bank where

Orville Hodges cashed his state warrants). Secured by 206,000

shares CC stock. Due August 5, 1961.

February 1961 (?)

Best's shows CC sustained losses in 1958, 1959 and 1960

with the 1960 losses exceeding those in 1958 and 1959. Expenses

were 110.3% of premiums received. Report shows about $467,000 in

uncollected premiums from agents while CC reports about $350,000

in premiums due.

shows additional $300, 000 put into the business

in 1960; assets increased $90,000 with an office building in

Alburquerque, New Mexico. (Previous Labor investigation shows

only $15,000 value for building. (Wright had said co salaries

out of line.)

did not renew United Benefit's license. UB had an underwriting

Loss of $260,103 in 1960 and losses in each 5 previous years of

more than $150,000. D. C. Ielt

this made the company insecure.

Also the account "Surplus Notes" in UB's statement, according

to D. C. law should be listed as a liability and this would reduce

UB's surplus from $401,585 to $151,585. Other things noted by the

D. C. department were that UB was under reserve in one area, and

that the value of acquired stock was unable to be détermined by D. C.

Earl E. Cefry is fired from United Benefit. Cefry later

wrote BLMR explaining that he was hired by George Stewart for UB

in 1953 and at that time did not realize that Hopps dominated UB.

He stated he subsequently learned that 90% quota reinsurance was

written thru Leadenhall, Itd., owned by Hopps and that two of UB's

largest agencies, Heidelberg in San Francisco and Hooper in Los

Angeles were controlled by Hopps.

Bray said UB was happy until summer of 1961 when expressed

dissatisfaction with CC because of U. S. Government pressure.

Wright and James I. Burch of United Bonding say that Cefry

contacted them about taking over as primary surety on the Teamster

bonding, and that Cefry said he was acting for Bray. The proposal

was that 10% of premiums received would go to HBS as brokerage

fee and 25% to HBS as agent with Lloyds insuring losses between

$100,000 and $400,000.

Wright said Cefry was let go by United Benefit because

of large losses UB sustained on construction bonds written

One bond of $100,000 Cefry failed to

reinsure and UB suffered the whole loss. Wright often asked

for list of locals anadetails of premium processing, but never

got them. Bray told Wright Bray would get West Coast bonding.

would be Houston Fire and Central Casualty with

in agreement with United Benefit and gives just-

On petition by S.E.C., Federal Judge Miner

enjoined Central Casualty from taking control of

Professional Life and Casualty Company through

an exchange of stock.

Harold J. Craig, salesman

for Professional, Charles Bray, James Bray and

Homer Bray Service, Inc., planned to acquire Profes-

sional in an exchange of 3 shares of Central Casualty

for one Professional. Craig induced Professional

shareholders to put their shares in an escrow acoount

at Guaranty.

Homer Bray Service, Inc. would then

match each Professional share with 3 Central Casualty.

In this manner, Central Casualty got 50% of Professional

but Professional's management refused to transfer

the stock. Central Casualty did not register with

the S.E.C. and the S.a.C. said the transaction was

an "offering" and needed registration. Judge Miner

agreed. Professional's management complained

that the exchange was not a fair one and that manage-

ment had no knowledge of it. Bray filed statement

that his group was abandoning their attempt.

on a reinsurance deal. The Chicago Tribune of

company included: Bernardo Carames, President

(former Minister of Justice under Batista), Luis J.

Botifoll, a stockholder, (a lawyer and former editor of

and now publicity man for the anti-Castro Cuban

Revolutionary Council), Carlos Prio, a stockholder,

(former President of Cuba üntil ousted in 1952

by Batista) and Amadeo Barletta, (a wealthy Italian,.

owner of El Mundo whose extensive Cuban holdings

were seized by Castro).

According to Chicago newspapers, John M.

Kearney, Vice President of Intercontinental Insurance

and Surety Co., stated that his firm had severed

relations with Central Casualty on July 1960 and

that "full and complete settlement between the com-

panies had been effected in 1961". Kearney said that

some of Intercontinental's records were in Havana,

Mexico City and Panama.

Kearney denied that Botifol,

Prio and Barletta had any connection with his firm.

Gerber says Bray transferred to Homer Bray Service, Inc.

$700,000 of insurance funds that cannot be accounted

for.

Bray also posted unauthorized insurance company

stock for loans from bonds and ther have been some

defaults.

Bray told Chicago News that Central Casualty

wrote individual A & H policies worth $60,624 in

premiums from members of the Teamsters and other unions.

Also wrote group policies worth $129,703 mostly with

the Teamsters. Also handled bonds for officials of

the Teamsters and five other international unions that

would have amounted to $600,000 in business over

3 years; but this business was cancelled after 18

months and the big insurance companies took it over.

Bray said that Central Casualty in 1962 had anticipated

53,500,000 total sales as opposed to $2,500,000 in

1961.

Bray said Oxford has not paid commissions to

its agents including Weiner and Schwartz for IBI

health

and welfare insurance.

Further, he said the

proceeds from the Exchange Bank loan did not go to

Oxford nor to the Dorfmans nor to any official. No

longer on speaking terms with the Dorfmans.

Scribner of Resolute said that because

of the happenings at Central Casualty and

Oxford and because of the uncollected premiums

on IBT bonds (about 50,000); certain changes

were made. Resolute anticipated that Oxford

would not get a new license and transferre

to Titan in September 1961. In regard to the

unpaid premiums, Resolute credited Oxford's

earned commission to them. (what pappened to

the premiums?)

An article in the Chicago Tribune men-

tioned that several years ago Central and Oxford

were ordered by Gerber to stop soliciting

union business and return all premiums already

paid. It is believed that the companies

had proposed selling a bond which would in

indemnify union officers for costs of defending

criminal suits against them, which is illegal..

Central Casualty liquidated by court

order. Bail bond records were not seized

by the state but were taken prior to this date

by Cosmopolitan. (Is Gerber in league with

Cosmopolitan).

Unsigned undated letter to ICT from

oxford Agency, Inc. Board of Trade Building,

111 W. Jackson Blvd., Chicago, advising

renewal rates on the bond at the expiration

Department.

Gerber says that Central Casualty issued 11, 655

shares of unauthorized stock. Mentions two loans: one

for $102,000 from the Guaranty Bond (the bank where Orville

Hodges cashed his state warrants) to Bray; the other for

an undisclosed amount from the Pan American Bank in Miami

to Eagan. The 11,55 shares were given to Champaign,

Illinois bank as security for a loan to Craig.

This was

as part of the proposed merger with Professional Life and

the shares were to be given for 3,835 shares of Professional

Life.

However the S.E.C. stepped in and Bray withdrew

the deal. The shares were returned and never appeared on

the books.

Three certificates for 50,000 shares each were

given to Pan American Bank. (Burks said his signature was

forged.)

Gerber said Bray defaulted on a loan from another

Chicago Bank for which he put up 250,000 shares, and a

bonding Company was forced to make it good.

A spokesman for Central Casualty said Bray lost

$500,000 after Gerber

announced his investigation.

Gerber said he saved Central Casualty $150,000 to

$200,000 in losses by selling the lease to the building

that housed Central Casualty and Homer Bray Service, Inc,

disposing of litigation and with funds from the bail bond

escrow account.

Illinois Insurance Commissioner's Office examina-

tion Central Casualty and Homer Bray Services Inc. has

not shown any connection with Allen Dorfman.

The Chicago Tribume reported that Central Casualty

issued more than 300,000 unauthorized shares and that two

sets of books were used. One set showed three stock cer-

tificates were issued in 1960 for 50,000 shares each; the

other set showed stock certificates with the same numbers

were issued in 1961 for 350 shares each.

The 150,000 shares

put up by Egan in Miami as collateral were not owned by him.

Charles Bray and James Egan, former vice

president of Central Casualty, were in Miami with

Sam Kaye. Allegedly, Bray, Egan and Kaye are

associated in a business deal involving exchange

of foreign currency, possibly in Rio de Janiero.

It was reported that Egan sufferedaa heart attack

while in Miami and was hospitalized at a Jewish

Hospital in Miami; his condition is unknown.

(Bill Kenny in Miami reported that Kaye and

Santos. Traficante are on good terms, that Traficante

assisted Kaye in some South American deal.)

Sid Cox of Treasury reported that Bianchi

went with Cosmopolitan after Central folded. United

Benefit had been owed $90,000 by Central Casualty

which debt Cosmopolitan paid in order to get the

bail bond business. Recently Cosmopolitan bought

out United Benefit. FNU Volin is a director in
