RE:

FILE 62-11.7290 PERTAINING TO THE HOUSE

SELECT COMMITTEE

. ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

Pursuant to letters from Congressman Louis Stokes and

the Clerk of the House of Representatives, any material relating

to the work of the HSCA should not be released.

The FBI is currently in litigation with a requester for

all material provided to the HSCA concerning its investigation

into the assassination of President Kennedy. The House of Rep-

resentatives is joining the litigation in an attempt to claim

Congressional privilege for all of the material connected to

the HSCA investigation.

This includes all correspondence be-

tween the FBI and the HSCA, as well as internal FBI communica-

tions.

The HSCA's position is that these materials, as well as

materials concerning its investigation of the assassination

of

Martin Luther King,

are congressional documents and not agency

records and therefore,

are excludable from release pursuant

to Title 5, United States Code, Section 552 (1) (A) , 1976.

is noted that the HSCA investigation of the assassination of Martin

Luther King is not in litigation.)

Therefore, any material contained in Bufile 62-117290,

or duplicative documents which. may be unrecorded in other Bufiles

should be denied.

Should you have any questions concerning this,

please contact Willis Newton on extension 5767.

contacted the Springfield Division.

FREYVOGEL, who repre-

sented himself as a keporter for St Louis Post Dispatch,

St. Louis, Missouri, phone 314-621-1111, extension 696,

advised he was contacting FBI, Springfield, regarding an

article which he has allegedly been requested to write by

the Governor of the State of Missouri.

According to FREYVOGEL,

he is doing research concerning ERNEST TURLEY, convicted

of bank robbery in 1970, regarding an alleged

at Laddonia, Missouri.

to FREYVOGEL, TURLEY iS

to be pardoned soon, possibly by the Governor of the State distu

of Missouri.

FREYVOGEL advised that he obtained information

from JAMES ROGERS and CLARENCE HAYNES, who purport to be

associates of JOHN LARRY RAY, brother to JAMES

EARL RAY.

FREYVOGEL contends that information from ROGERS and HAYNES

indicates that TURLEY did not commit the Laddonia, Missouri

bank robbery.

FREYVOGEL further indicated that he had infor-

mation that ROGERS, HAYNES and RAY were involved in the

Meredosia and Liberty bank robberies in 1969 or 1970, but

that no prosecution was ever instituted.

For information of st. Louis, SI file 91-4774

(destroyed) regarding the Farmers and Traders State Bank

of Meredosia, Illinois, was closed as a solved case. Further,

Springfield matter 91-4653 (destroyed)., the Farmers State

Bank at Liberty, Illinois, was closed

as a solved matter.

Both bank robberies occurred in 1969.

FREYVOGEL wanted information as to whether or not

ERNEST TURLEY was or was not an associates of ROGERS, HAYNES

and RAY. Springfield indices indicate CLARENCE EDGAR HAYNES

The Role Of The FBI

It is not exactly & clean bill of health that the

House Assassinations Committee gives the Federal

•Bureau of Investigations in the murder of Dr.

..evidence otherwise.

idea of discrediting him as a civil rights leader.

T'his is beyond the role of any police organization

and should have been unworthy of contemplation

by the fBI. The many things that have been re-

vealed by the bureau that it did against Dr. King

have also been done against others in the civil

rights movement. Some St. Louisians were har-

rassed. The House Committse says now that it

has no evidence that an FBI assassinations squad

murdered the civil rights leader April 4, 1968.

But it says there is some evidence that the ha-

rassment of Dr. King may have been the under-.

lying reason he was in Memphis at all.

The committee did investigate the allegations.

made by Lawyer. Mark Lane, who turned up in

the middle of the tragedy in Guyana this week.

• According to Lane's story, Dr. King had spent a

night at white-owned Foliday Inn in Memphis.

The FBI, Lane said, tried to plant a false news

story that Dr. King was thus avoiding the black-

owned Lorraine Motel. It has not been substanti-

ated whether or not alleged FBI plant was ever

printed or if it existed in fact. Dr. King's follow-

ers say that he regularly stayed at the Lorraine

so that nis presence there was not out of the

ordinary.

• There were two other stories that the commit-

tee has investigated. One was that FBI agents

tried to engage a Louisville Ky., man to kill Di

King. The other story is that a Miami man over-

heard a conversation about an FBI plot to kill

Dr. King. Chief Counsel G. Robert Blakey said

be more comfortable with that statement if the

word "direct" were not there. We noticed the

Although the committee has not found any

evidence of the FBI's direct involvement in Dr.

King's death, the committee is going to pursue

the Bureau's indirect involvement. This includes

trying to determine whether or not the FBI's

admitted campaign to harass and discredit Dr.

King as a civil rights leader didn't result in his

presence at that time.

The biggest tragedy being revealed by this

and other investigative efforts is the lack of con-

government department or bureau out of his hip

the authority from Washington. This means that

responsible decisions can be made in the field.

Written reports will have to ba filed to substanti-

ST. LOUIS

POST-DISPATCH

•By WENDELL RAWLSJR.

€1978, New York Times News Service

VASHINGTON - After all the witnesses have beeg

heard and all the evidence analyzed and digested, the

House Select Committee on Assassinations is expected

to conclude that James Earl Ray killed the Rev. Dr.

Martin Luther King for money - $50,000 that he never

collected from a right-wing St. Louis businessman who

wanted the civil rights leader slain.

And the committee is expected to decide that the

Federal Bureau of Investigation botched the case,

apparently ignoring the possiblity of conspiracy in the

assassination and concentrating on the identification

and apprehension of a fugitive. In the process, valuable

time and evidence was lost, important figures never

were interviewed and information was disregarded, if

not hidden.

Even though the committee is conducting hearings

to build the public record, its investigation is virtually

completed allowing it to arrive at several conclusions.

That picture can be drawn on the basis of interviews

with committee members, witnesses and congressional

staff officials.

According to the committee's investigation and a

separate investigation by The New York Times, the

presence of a standing $50,000 offer was well known in

the St. Louis area in 1967 and 1968 and probably had

been reported to federal authorities prior to King's

murder.

The two investigations have produced the following

scenario as the most likely way the lives of two men

collided in the cross-hairs of political assassination.

On July 13, 1967, about three months after Ray es-

caped from the Missouri State Penitentary, he and

perhaps his two brothers robbed a bank in Alton, Ill.,

and took $27,000:

Ray's split of the proceeds, and the money he accu,

mulated through odd jobs and other robberies he has

publicly acknowledged, would have been sufficient to

finance his adventures and expenditures from the time

pe leit prison until he was captured at London's He.lth-

NOW Airport on June 8, 1968.

From the prison escape on April 23, 1967, until the

bink robbery on July 13, Ray adhered pretty much to

his familiar lifestyle of rooming-house beds and beane-

ry bowis. There were stints as a dishwasher and food

_server

But the day after the bank robbery,

turned up in Montreal, signed a six-month lease on al

"apartment, bought $250 worth of new clothes and vaca-

toned at a fashionable Canadian ski resort.

* He later traveled to Mexico and California, revertin®

ito his old pattern by spending an average of $3 a day for

food and ¾ a day for lodging.

While Ray was on the run, a prominent patent attor-

ney in St. Louis was looking for someone to assassinate

King.

A former St. Louis auto parts dealer named Russell

G. Byers has sajd that he was approached sometime in

late 1966 or early 1967 by a business associate, John R.

Kauffmann, who invited him to a meeting with the pa-

tent attorney, John H. Sutherland.

Sutherland, a member of the conservative Southern

States Industrial Council and a leader of the White Citi-

zen's Council of St. Louis, told Byers that a group of

businessmen would pay $50,000 for the murder of King,

according to Byers.

Byers said that he declined the offer. The other two

men are now dead.

Panel Rejects Claim

FBI Killed Dr. King

WASHINGTON (AP) The House Assassinations.

Committee reported today that it had found no evidence-

to support a charge that a squad of off-duty FBI agents

assassinated the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King

And. Walter Fauntroy, the delegate in the House

from the District of Columbia, and-a member of the

committee, denounced lawyer Mark Laneras:a spiteful

"consummate pitchman."

Fauntroy denied Lane's allegation, that Fauntroÿ

had said the panel had./evidence-that King had been

murdered by an FBI assassination squad, U:N. Ambas

sador Andrew Young was called before the committee

as a surprise witness: to, testily that fauntroy.had. not

told him'of an alleged FBL assassination squad as Lane

charges.

However; a former FBI agent testified today that the

bureau had conducted' "a 10 year, vendtta"

King and then botched is inves gation or his " asons-

tion by ignoring the possibility of conspiracy.

'Arthur Murtaugh, a former agent in Atlanta and now

a college professor, testified that before King was as-

sassinated: the Atlanta FBlhad 15 agents-assigned to:

Telectronic.surveillance.of. the civil.rights leader. After

the murder, Murtaugh said; the investigation was as-

signed: to the Intelligence Division, the same agency

thạt nao nad king under survellance, and not the Crim-

inal Division.

he also said, the investigation was made routine as

soon as. James. Earl.Ray.wasridentified as the assassin

and as a fugitive to be caught.

As the panel: today began a four-day public inquiry.

on allegations against the FBI, chief coursel;G. Robert:

Blakey said,

"The. committee found.no evidence.of di-

rect. FBI involvement in King's murder.

But Blakey.said the:hearings would deal with ques

tions of "possible indirect involvement." He,said these

included questions of whether the FBy's admitted

campaign to harass, and discredit King as a civilrights.

leader resulted in King's presence. in Memphis, where

he was assassinated on April 4,1968:

Fauntroy in his remarks, denounced Lane as a man

who thrives on publicity- good or bad."

"Mr. Lane's repeated attempts to Spitefully use the

death of Dr. King and to spitefully use those who were

associated with him in life for his own purposes require

that I remain silent no more;" Fauntroy said.

Lane has written books on the murders.of both Dr

King and President John F. Kennedy:

Fauntroy,said Lane had turned over to the commit-

tee an affidayit by Danjel Ellsberg, the man who made

the Pentagon Papers public, quoting an aide to Ambas

sador Young as saying Fauntroy had toldithe ambassi

dor ot the EBT assassination squad. The committee then

called Young, who denied the report.

The committée called also Brady Tyson, the aideto

Young, and Tyson testified that he had told Ellsberg

only that the FBI assassination squad was his own"pet

theory.'

Experts Unable To Link Bullet

To Ray's Rifle

By Karl Evanzz

ARGUS Staff Writer

After 10

'ycars,

of

examination and reexami-

nation by ballistics experts

and medical experts, no

one has been able to

establish with any degrce

of certainty whether the

rifle found across the

street from the Lorraine

Motel with James Early

Ray's fingerprints on it is

the same one which fired

the bullet that took the life,

of the Rey. Dr. Martin

Luther King, Jr. .

• Even more disturbing,

since a man believed to be

Ray was spotted as he

peeied through an open

curfain in the window on

the second .flcor.of the

rooming house adjacent

to the Lorraine, is the lact

that nọ

one is abie to

determine

from

the

medical evidence that the

shot was fired from the

second-floor

bathroom

window

of from

the

shrubbery

below

. the

window.

The most that the FBI

and now.

the House

Assassination's Com-

mittee which resumed

hearings on the deaths of

King and President John

F. Kennedy last week, is,

that the fatal shot was

probably fired from the

direction of the rooming

shouse.

These

startling

revelations came last Fri-

Iday as a panci of ballistics

experts testified before

the committee on their

findings.

Each of the specialists

conducted their own tests

with Ray's Remington

rifle, and each found that

they could neither match

the test bullets with one

another nor with the

shallered remains of the

slug that killed King on

April 4. 1968.

The pancl of experts

said they could not even

make scientific matches of

the bullets fired from

Ray's rifle in a series of

tests because their is

always a variation in the

markings on hard-jacketgd

bullets.

The committee in •coer.

tinuing

its

investiga-

tion into the truth of Ray's

denial of assassinating the

civil rights leader.

While Ray and his

attorney insist Ray is

innocent, most of the

witnesses

who

have

testified have said that the

convicted Missourian is

the actual killer.

Mark

Lane,

Ray's

attorney, refutes those

witnesses and recently re-

portedly gave the com-

mitted evidence which

established' that off-duty

and former FBI agents

were directly involved in

the assassination and that

Ray was nothing more

than a "dupe.'

Shortly before Dr. Kig

was murdered, it was

revealed that his every

seei ran,

movement was scrutinized

and recorued br the FBl

and that practically every

phone conversation he had

gwas monitored.

When King was at the

summit of his poser, the

diate FBI Director J. Edgar

Hoover denounced him as

the most "vicious liar il

the countrs.

Documents recently

all-

lassificd-by the FBI alsof

Percaled that the domestic

intelligence agencyl

director had organized

program "to prevent the

rise of a Black Messiah."

The controversial program

was known within the

agcncy

as

"COIN-

TELPRO," meaning,

counter-intelligence pro

Meredosia, Ill., on 1/28/70. Photos of the group of RAY

associates were brought to the bank by Agents from St. Louis

and witnesses from outside the bank the day before the robbery

and witnesses involved in the robbery identified photographs

of TURLEY and HAYNES:

Federal process was obtained.

HAYNES

was arrested in St. Louis a day or so after the cobbery

and marked money from the robbery was recovered on his

person.

TURLEY was arrested in St. Louis a week or so later

and no money was recovered.

A showup was held at st. Louis

PD. for witnesses from all three robberies.

There witnesses

picked HAYNES as being the person who ran the bank robbery

but were not as positive on fUrLey.

One witness from the

Meredosia bank robbery picked the photograph of TURLEY as

being the tall bank robber and HAYNES as being the short

bank robber.

Both subjects TURLEY and HAYNES were being tried

In USDC, St. Louis, during November, 1970. Düring. the trzal

HAYNES

changed his plea from not guilty to guilty and

testified for the government. He testified TURLEY was with

him but he would not name the other participants until the

Judge directed him to.

He named his associates as JOHN

LARRY RAY, JAMES RUSSELI, TURLEY, JAMES RUSSELL ROGERS, and

ERNEST TURLEY. At the end of the trial TURLEY was acquitted.

Audrain County Sheriff HAROLD SULGROVE, now deceased,

had state robbery warrants for

both subjects with him.

the

warrants had been issued shortly after the bank robbery.

After the acquittal of TURLEY he called Irosecuting Attorney

THOMAS: I. OSBORN at Mexico and asked him if he could bring

TURIEY back for trial:

OSBORN told him to bring him back

but he would discuss the prosecution later.

TURLEY's lawyer called OSBORN and he also talked

to AUSÀ KENNETH R. HEINEMAN who tried TUrLY in USDC and

OSBORiT decided that he would tell the defense attorney that

if TURLEY would take a polygraph examination and pass he

would not try TUrLEY, however, if TURLEY would refuse to

take the examination he would

have to try him. OSBORN

advised the defense attorney that with TURIEY's record and the

eye witnesses he thought that he owed it to the state to

try TURLEX.

TURLEY appealed the fact that he was being tried

after being acquitted in Federal court to the Missouri Court

of appeals, U. S. Court of Appeals, and the u. S. Supremo

Court. The Court of Apreals denied his appeal and the

Suprent Court would not hear the case. He was later ordered

for trial on a change of venue in Harren County Circuit

Court in Warrenton, Ho.

While out on bond and awaiting the court decisions

nudraIn County Sheriff SUlGROVE was in one of the St. Louis

City police precincts then TulLeY and his wife were brought

in for some violation. His wife said "I lied for you one

tine but I'm not going to lie for you again." During the

subsequent trial in Warren County Circuit Court SULGROVE

remembered this and got the detective to testify who had

this infornation.

TURLEY was tried, convicted and sentenced to 30

years in the state penitentiary.

While awaiting transportation

to the state penitentiary he escaped from the Warren County

Jail and was later apprehended on a UFAP warrant in Florida

by fBI Agents.

at Laddonia In 1910. He advised that the house select

Committee on Assassinations investigators had infornation

fIOn JAMES RUSSELL ROGERS and CLARENCE EDGAR HAYNES

warrant and that DUNCAN did not push TURLEY's investigation

and did not push for his trial in state court. OSBORN

said that he thought that the witnesses probably were not

too positive at the time of the banl robbery since the

the good showup photograph that was taken both with the

nylon stockings and without and the rcporter advised that he

had not.

about the House Select Cormittce on Assassinations petition

to the Governor of lissouri for a pardon for turder.

JAMES COOPER GREEN, JR.

For information of SAC, GREEN is a Caucasian male,

DOB 1/7/47, FBI $432 338 F., and

from 1/6/70, until ?/11/74,

was under parole supervision of the U.S. Probation and Parole

Office, Cape Girardeau, Mo.

GREEN had been convicted of

ITSAV violation in USDC, Memphis, Tennessee.

On 11/7/78, SA TOM TEYSSIER, BATF, Cape Girardeau,

advised. SA GORHAM that TEYSSIER had a conversation with

GREEN on this date.

GREEN related to TEYSSIER that he (GREEN) •

was to appear before a Congressional committee in the fall of

1979,

which committee was investigating Federal investigative

agencies.

GREEN also

stated that he would reveal that

GORHAM had requested him to break into a juage's house in

Pemiscot County, MO. TEYSSIER obtained no additional

information; however, related GREEN indicated that he would

receive a Presidential pardon.

BATE, Cape Girardeau, is familiar with GREEN aS

GREEN was utilized as an informant in Peniscot County in

ycars 1973 or 1974 to make gun buys.

GREEN subsequently

worked for BATE under undercover Sting operation in Memphis,

Tennessee.

•On 11/8/78, SA DICK HERBERT, BATF, Cape Girardeau,.

Mo., advised that GREEN on 11/8/78, displayed a subpoena to

testify in Washington, D.C., 11/10/78, at 2:00 p.M. before

assassinations and

other matters: GREEN stated that SA GORHAM asked GREEN to

break into Judge RAGLAND'S

house at Caruthersville and this

break-in concerned a piano.

GREEN alleged that he had a

witness regarding this matter.

WILLIAM L. RAGLAND is a

Circuit Judge for New Madrid. and Pemiscot Counties, Mo.

SA GORHAM can recollect only three contacts with

was in Cape Girardeau visiting with U.S. Probation ana Parole

officer CHARLES MATHEWS.

GREEN stated

that he was capable of

getting information regarding criminal activities in Pemiscot

County and appeared to be wanting to be an informant.

NO

attempt was made to develo! GREEN as an informant inasnuch as

he was on Federal parole.

It is possible, however SA GORMAM

has no recollection, that the matter of pianos was discussed

inasmuch as SA DOUGIAS ROSENBERGER (retired) had a 15 case in

1971 or 1972 in which three Caruthersville men, HAROLD HINCHEY,

CLYDE MANLEY, and ENNETT LEE, were convicted for the theft of

a shipment of pianos. All, the pianos in this matter were not.

recovered:

On one other occasion; possibly in 1974, GREEN

again appeared at the RA and all that can be recalled from

this contact was GREEN advising

that he was working for the

U.S. Attorner's Office in Memphis and was seeking a pardon.

=..

•SA GORHAM believes that he observed GREEN several

years ago outside or possibly inside the sheriff's office at

Caruthersville, Mo., and only greetings were exchanged.

• . .

BATF, Cape Girardeau, and U.S. Probation and Parole

Officer CHARLES MATHEWS consider GREEN as

• "unstable."

• Any accusations GREEN makes against SA GORHAM Or

the St. Louis Division of the FBI regarding any illegal

SUBJECT:

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

BUDED.: 11/9/78

Re Bureau teletype to St. Louis, 11/7/78.

Enclosed herewith is one copy each of Serials 14 -

150 inclusive and one copy of Serial IA-1, all from SI file

100-17801 captioned "MARTIN LUTHER RING, JR.; SM - C".

A review of the enclosed serials will reveal that

several permanent charge-outs are in this file revealing the

tact that certain serials have been previously furnished to

FBIHQ and are no longer available, nor are copies of those

serials available, to the St. Louis Office.

The following additional comments are offered for

the benefit of the Bureau:

Serial 33 is a newspaper clipping dated 3/21-22/64.

Serial. 35 is SI airtel to the Bureau dated 3/25/64 captioned

"COMMUNIST PARTY, USA, NEGRO QUESTION, COMMUNIST INFLUENCE

IN RACIAL MATTERS, INTERNAL SECURITY - C". Between these two

serials is a form captioned "Metropolitan Police Department,

City of st. Louis, Vehicular Accident Report".

This accident

report is Serial 34; however, the blockstamp and serializa-

tion information appears on the reverse of page 1 of this

report and is not reproduced in the enclosure.

Serial 52 is missing. St. Louis cannot determine

at this time whether Serial 52 was inadvertently skipped in

the serializing process or was permanently charged out and

sent to the Bureau without a permanent charge-out being

submitted to the file.

Between Serials 55 and 57 is a photograph over

AT COMMUNIST TRAINING SCHOOL". This is Serial 56 which was

blockstamped and serialized on the reverse side and is not

Between Serials 125 and 126 is an unserialized

memorandum dated 6/23/66

frOm SA RICHARD BOYD SMITH to the

SAC captioned "A Citizen's White Paper; Info Concerning".

This memorandum was apparently inadvertently skipped in

serializing.

Serial 131 is Chicago airtel to the Bureau dated

3/28/67 enclosing an LHM. That IHM is dated 3/28/67 at

Illinois and bears the following dual captions

CHARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., RACIAI MATTER; DEMONSTRATIONS,

CHICAGO FREEDOM MOVEMENT (CEM) - SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADER-

SHIP CONFERENCE (SCIC), CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, RACIAL MATTER"•

That LHM is Serial 130; however, is blockstamped and

serialized on the reverse of page l and is not reproduced

herewith.

Serial 134 is St. Louis airtel to the Bureau

dated 7/18/67 captioned "CP - USA, POLITICAL ACTIVITY, IS - C,

CINAL,". That airtel enclosed an LIM dated 7/18/67 at St.

Louis,

Missouri captioned "NEW POLITICS".

The LHM was not

serialized separately in this file as it should have been

and, therefore, bears no serial number.

SI. 62-5097

At the time EDMONDSON became an IO fugitive in

May, 1966, an "88" indices card was prepared indicating

that ALEXANDER GEORGE BEN EDMONDSON was an alias of

GEORGE BEN EDMONDSON whose date of birth was 8/3/37,

Springfield, Missouri, and who was assigned FBI $990

and who was the subject of IO #4011 and wanted flyer #398.

At the time of filing this indices card, a prior reference

to EDMONDSON (SL 137-4674) was consolidated thereon. It

is assumed that sometime during the period that EDMONDSON

was an informant for the Kansas City Division, the St.

Louis Division received a lead to check the National

Personnel Records Center concerning EDMONDSON and, this

being prior to the current method of not opening up full

cases for record checks, a "137" case was opened for the

purpose of checking those records.

At the time the "137"

reference was added to the "88" indices card, the date of

the "137" being opened should have been added also but this

was not done.

Following normal destruction procedures, when

EDMONDSON "'s

"g8" file was destroyed, that number was inked'

out on the indices card leaving only the reference to

137-4674.

Under the old file destruction program (approximately

five years ago), SL file 137-4674 was destroyed and the

Eila

indices card should have been purged; however, the indices

card was inadvertently not destroyed.

The above

described indices card has been purged

from the St. Iouis indices and is being maintained as an

exhibit in captioned file.

On August 2, 1978, along with Special Agent Dennis D. Mattes,

FBI, St. Louis Division, St. Louis, Missouri, I interviewed Oliver

Patterson, Jr. at his residence, 12350 Old Halls Ferry Road,

Black Jack, Missouri.

I have never had any contact with any media representatives

concerning the intervier with Oliver Patterson, Jr., nor did I

reveal to Patterson that the House Select Committee on Assassinations

(HSCA) may be the source of any information concerning the interview.

During the interview with Patterson; I did ask him if

he was familiar with, or have any knowledge of, a man by the name

of Clarence Haynes, This question was directed to Patterson in

order to ascertain Haynes! whereabouts in order to inform Haynes

and local law enforcement agency, as expeditiously as possible,

that retaliatory action may be taken against Haynes.

I did not inform Patterson directly that Haynes may be

the victim of a retaliatory act, however,

due to the line of

questioning, I believe Patterson came to this conclusion.
