GENERAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION

During the past year and a half AMLEO-3 has been placated,

and kept under control,

the continuous effort of KUBARK to assist

him in obtaining asylum for his wife and family in a third country

diplomatic installation in Cuba.

Since the failure of the last

asylum attempt for Mrs. AMLEO-3 in March 1964, as reported in refer-

ence I, and the refusal of Mrs. AMLEO-3 to even consider taking asylum

without advance guarantees of a salvo conducto; AMLEO-3 lost what

Iittle optimism he had remaining for a safe method of bringing his

wife and children out of Cuba.

After the failure of the asylum

attempt in March 1964, Mrs. AMLEO-3 again renewed her attackupon

AMLEO-3 by phone and letter, urging him to rescue her by any means

at his disposal,

and by her efforts she has successfully convinced him

that his family will escape only if she can arrange an exfiltration

mounted from inside the island, or if AMLEO-3 sends someone to get her

or comes himself to exfiltrate her and their children.

Up until

recently the C/O has been able to persuade AMLEO-3 that undertakings

of this nature were foolhardy unless carried out by trained maritime

assets skilled in clandestine infiltration and exfiltration,

equipped with the proper vessels and support to carry out the mission

successfully.

Now that the KUBARK asylum efforts have been discon-

tinued, and

AMLEO-3 is aware that KUBARK will not sponsor any maritime

exfiltration attempts to rescue his family, he has decided that he

would prefer to terminate his relationship

with KUBARK so that he can

out such exfiltration attempts on his own in a completely

independent manner.

Since November 1963, JMWAVE has noted in all AMLEO progress

reports that Mrs. AMLEO-3 was dabbling in exfiltration attempts in

side Cuba,

and has also successfully managed to pry funds out of

AMLEO-3 in attempts to buy her way into such efforts.

As a result

AMLEO-3 has borrowed money from AMSHED-1 and family

relatives in the \

attempting to support his wife in these attempts, and is now in

debt to these individuals to the tune of $4-$5,000.00.

On 5 May 1964,

AMLEO-3 Informed his C/O, that he had recently heard from his wife via

and in her letter she had

told him that she planned to participate in an exfiltration attempt li

from inside the Island the weekend of I0 May 1964

AMLEO-3 requested !

the C/O to alert QKMAGNET to this attempt

and said that he expected

to have confirmation of the attempt by 1900 hours on 10 May 1964.

Nothing was heard from AMLEO-3 the night of 10 May 1964, but the

lowing morning, at 0840 hours 11 May 1964, AMLEO-3 contacted the C/O

and gave him the following information:

"The exfiltration of my family will begin on the night

of l1 May 1964, and the group will consist of some li

adults and children.

They plan to depart from Playa

de Guanabo,

between Havana and Matanzas, during the

night of Il May 1964 and expect

to arrive in Key West,

Florida sometime on 12 May 1964. "

AMLEO-3 claimed he knew nothing about what type of boat the group

planned to use, nor the exact time oi departure, route

meeting, that he had sponsored and masterminded the aborted exfiltratio

operation, and that the operation had been mounted from the U.S.,

not from inside the island, as he had previously claimed to the C/O.

On 14 May 1964, the C/O contacted AMLEO-3 and requested an

explanation of his sponsorship of the

exfiltration operation. AMLEO-3

claimed he no longer felt bound to confide these activities on his

part to KUBARK,-since KUBARK had refused to-continue its effert to

rescue his wife and family from Cuba, and furthermore that he would

continue such unilateral exfiltration efforts with or without KUBARK

help until he either rescued his family from Cuba, or died in his

attempts to do so.

AMLEO-3 claims he organized the trip of the M/V

ADA by passing himself off as a PBPRIMER, and utilized the following

individuals in the operation.

There was no beach per se at this spot but reefs from 6 to 9 feet high

During

One other truck, containing about 15 negroes and 6 whites,

LOPEZ states that the traffic was unusually heavy

RODRIGUEZ told LOPEZ that he had been able to

BLANCO to Artemisa where their respective families are located.

down the coast from Guanabo,

and they attempted to land on the

Due to large rocks and heavy surf they decided not to

acquired as passengers.

These passengers were all relatives of BLANCO

and AMBIG-4, and BLANCO and AMBIG-4 told RODRIGUEZ they had been unable

to locate the homes of Jesus GOMEZ Calzadilla and AMLEO-3 and therefore

had not been able to contact these families.

They then returned the

bona fides photos and messages to RODRIGUEZ to take back to AMLEO-3

and GOMEZ.

(AMLEO-3 commented bitterly on this point stating that

AMBIG-4 and BLANCO probably went to their own homes first, and after

seeing the number of their relatives who wanted to

tried to find his home nor that of GOMEZ.)

RODRIGUEZ,

AMBIG-4,

BLANCO agreed upon another exfiltration point to the east of Guanabo,

arranged recognition signals.

RODRIGUEZ then returned to the boat;

leaving AyBIG-4 and BLANCO to convoy the passengers in three cars to

the exfiltration point.

RODRIGUEZ and LOPEZ arrived at the exfiltration point about

80 minutes after the appointedhour of 2300,

and halted the boat about

meters offshore.

They saw a light on top of the reef at which

point RODRIGUEZ told LOPEZ that the light was the proper signal.

When asked about the recognition signals,

LOPEZ stated that he

know what the exact signals were, but that they involved 2 or 3 lights

and an exchange of names.

He maintains that RODRIGUEZ handled all

these details).

They brought the boat right up to the reef at which

point they were fired upon from the top of the cliffs from the directi

of the highway.

(AMLABEL-1 asked LOPEZ how they had planned to get

women and children down these steep cliffs.

LOPEZ replied that the

difficulties-involved had not occurred to them.

By the same token,

they had no extra food on board the boat to feed the families.)

RODRIGUEZ shouted to LOPEZ to jump overboard to use the

LOPEZ started the motor and was proceeding

north when he

saw the signal lights of 6 or 7 small boats ringed in a semi-circle

GENERAL COMMENTS ON TRIP OF THE M/V ADA

As noted in paragraph 8 of refarence J,

various operational

inconsistencies still exist in the account submitted above re the

exfiltration trip of the M/V ADA to Cuba.

WAVE is of the opinion

that some of these inconsistencies can be attributed to genuine con-

fusion of facts by the principal source of information, Rogelio LOPEZ

Sosa, (who did not see the infiltration team of BLANCO

and AMBIG-4

again after their infiltration inland), and the withholding of facts

by AMLEO-3 who considers this activity.was his own personal büsiness:

and had nothing to do with KUBARK.

Daniel RODRIGUEZ Santos is

probably more knowledgeable of exactly what occurred during the inf1l-

tration, but due to his illness AMSWIRL-I was not able to interrogate

him in Key West, and reportedly RODRIGUEZ is still very 111 and

KUBARK does not

it worthwhile to

of him at this time.

It is also believed that RODRIGUEZ will withhold

information he considers privileged,

and it has been noted that
