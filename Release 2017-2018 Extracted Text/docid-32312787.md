Rebulet 8/24/61 and NY report dated 8/22/61. (u)

Regarding the possible defection of the subject,

this

desire is based upon the fact that TRUJILLO is alleged to have

had a fight over finances within the July 26th Movement, with

CESARIO/ NUNEZ.

This Information has been set out in the

referenced New York report of 8/22/61, under the Administrative

- section of the report.

This was done since, at the time the

575590-2

information was received, the identity of the original source

was not known, and concomitantly the reliability of the

information was subject to doubt. RAUL ANCHIA, the source who

apprised SA WARGER of the alleged altercation, could not comment

on how widely circulated was the information about the

alleged

fight.

cation Indefinite

Date of Deal

Since the time the information was received from ANCHIA,

he has advised that the original source of this information is

actually the wife of CESARIO NUNEZ,

the auditor who performed

the check on the finances that resulted in the discovery of the

shortage. Her identity must be protected since she is a

valuable

source of information to ANCHIA, and, therefore, to the

Bureau. (E)w

Furthermore, a new Informant has been developed by SA

WARGER, who is presently very active in the affairs of the July 26th

Movement in New York in Ramal WH, who advised on 8/24/61 that

he had heard of an "altercation"

between TRUJILLO and a person

who had checked the financial records of the July 26th Movement.

The source could not be probed at the time because of the newness

of the informant, who must, therefore, be warily regarded
