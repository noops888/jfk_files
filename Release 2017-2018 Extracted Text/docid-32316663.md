CG 105-8235

Regarding the alleged plans of JOHN SELTZ and JACK

NORDEEN Of Chicago to organize an attempt to overthrow the

government of Nicaragua, the following observations are

considered pertinent:

SELTZ,

age 21, the subject of Bufile 62-105585,

Chicago file 105-8235, Miami file 2-262, was last interviewed

September 26, 1960, by the Chicago Division.

SELTZ was

determined to be a

headstrong, immature individual of

considerable means who has expressed a desire to "free all

the backward nations of the world".

i...

NORDEEN, age 23, the subject of Bufile 62-105584,

Chicago file 2-71, Miami file 2-257, was last interviewed

August 4, 1960, by the Chicago Division.

A PSI investigation

reflected that NORDIEN (who had shot and killed his younger

brother in 1956) was considered to be an erratic, unstable

individual "full of fantastic ideas".

Upon interview June 4,

1959, NORDIEN told of working with the Castro forces in Cuba'

in 1958 and 1959 and then in June, 1959, travelling to

Oklahoma to search for gold.

In view of the above, it is felt that the informa-

tion furnished by SAUL SAGE does not provide sufficient

basis. for further investigation. of SELTZ and NORDEEN.

Accordingly, unless directed otherwise by the Bureau,

Springfield

may discontinue on the lead set out in relet and

Chicago will conduct no investigation of SELTZ and NORDEEN

at this time.

For the information of WFO, Chicago, with the

concurrence of

the Bureau, no longer

initiates contact with

CONSTANTINE W. KANGLES, former legal counsel for the Castro

Government in the U.S.

but accepts any information

volunteered by KANGLES.

Chicago will remain alert to any pertinent

information regarding SELTZ and NORDEEN and

their

participation in any activities of interest to this office.
