Rerep of SA JAMES J. FILES at Chicago dated 12/26/57 and report

Of SA H. R. MC CULLOUGH at Los Angeles dated 2/28/58.

The investigation reported below was conducted by SA ROBERT CLARK

STONE at Glendale, California, in an attempt to obtain the present where-

abouts and background Information concerning FRANK FERRARO, who, with

ANTHONY R. PINELLI (Top Hoodlum, Los Angeles Office), reportedly met this

subject at Los Angeles Airport on 1/15/53.

IA 3680-CS, who has in the past furnished considerable information

concerning hoodlums and petty racketeers in Glendale, California, and vicinity,

advised on 3/7/58 that he does not know FRANK FERRARO but that he recalls a

FRANK SORTINO, who may be identical, and who, with his wife, VICTORIA, ran

the Tom Tom Bar in Glendale, California, a few years ago. IA 3680-CS had no

current information about SORTINO.

On 3/7/58 Detective Sergeant JOHN BROOM and Detective WILLIAM

STENBERG, Glendale Police Department, furnished information that FRANK

SORTINO is no longer at the Tom Tom Bar but has a brother, THOMAS SORTINO,

who runs a bike shop on Glendale. Avenue just below Monterey in Glendale

together with his wife, MARGE SORTINO.

Detective STENBERG stated that he

has had frequent contact with THOMAS SORTINO and MARGE SORTINO and considers

them to be reliable persons who could be trusted to furnish truthful informa-

tion.

SA ROBERT CLARK STONE, on 3/14/50, checked all available Glendale

directories and was unable to find any reference to FRANK FERRARO. There

was no reference to FRANK SORTINO since 1953. The 1953 directory showed

that FRANK and VICTORIA SORTINO ran the Tom Tom Bar and lived in the City

of Los Angeles.

It did not show their residence address. A residence for

THOMAS G. SORTINO was reflected as 1311 Oak Circle Drive, Glendale, in 1957.

Detective Sergeant BROOM was recontacted on 3/14/58,/at which time

he said that he had obtained information that FRANK SORTINO has opened a

liquor store in a supermarket somewhere in Arcadia, California.

The following investigation was conducted at Los Angeles by

SA WILLIAM A. WATSON:

On 4/11/58 Mr. HOWARD WILLINBERG of the Sales Tax Division,

Board of Equalization, State of California, advised that FRANK and

VICTORIA SORTINO were continuing to do business at 253 Fast Gladstone,

Azusa, California, under the business name of "The Beverage Shop," which

is a liquor store.

On 4/18/58 Superintendent of Mails EDGAR T. MURPHY of the United

States Post Office, Glendora, California, (conceal) advised his recoras

contained a forwarding address for FRANK and VICTORIA SORLING, effective

12/5/57, showing they had moved as of that date from 1120 East LaFlora

Lane, Glendore, to 11543 Venice Boulevard, Los Angeles 66, California.

On 5/3/58 Superintendent of Mails CARL ADRIAN of the Mor Vista

Station, United States Post Office, Los Angeles (conceal), advised that

FRANK and VICTORIA SORTINO presently receive mail at 11543 Venice Boulevard.

It is noted that the last address shown above for SORTINO is

located at an extreme distance from his supposed place of employment,

and It is possible that SORTINO may have terminated his association

with the Beverage Shop or that the management may be in the hands of

some other party. This case is being maintained pending for the purpose

of further investigation to confirm or eliminate this possibility.

The files at Los Angeles contain no additional information

concerning FERRARO, wa. SORTINO, since the date of rerep.
