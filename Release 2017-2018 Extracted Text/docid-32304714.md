concurrent terms.

NAPLES' attorney, JOSEPH W. O'nEILl, Youngstown

City Council President, however, attempted to block the removal

that morning with an application for a writ of habeas corpus

before Common Pleas Judge ERSKINE MAIDEN, JR.,.

however, Judge

MAIDEN refused to hear the application because the sentences

for both recelving stolen property and promoting a numbers game

were pronounced by Common Pleas Judge JOHN W. FORD 1n 1962, and

suggested to Attorney O'NEILL that he see Judge SIDSY RIGELLAUPT,

Judge FORD's successor.

"and the

head of the

"Calabrese organization" in the Youngstown area, being

PAUL ROMEO of Campbell, Ohio. Informant advised he himself 1s of

Calabrese background,

but he is not a member of the "Calabrese organization."

Informant

stated the Sicillans in the area also have their own organization,

but they have never been close to the Calabrese, because one group

cannot trust the other.

He stated both groups act very much in

the same manner, like

"leeches", and once they get on a payroll,

they never let go.

VICTOR N. CALAUTTI, PCI,

advised the "Calabrese

organization" would no doubt be referred to as a criminal organization

and in his contacts has never heard the term

"Cosa Nostra."

he has heard, AIELLO will not be

a partner, however, that could

come later.

BATTISTI in Youngstown for sentencing:

Judge BATTISTI sentenced

WHITE to 4 years in the Federal penitentiary.

Prior to sentencing,

WHITE's attorney asked that his client be given a substantial

fine and probation rather than incarceration because his perjured

testimony was given

"with fear for his own protection," and that

he lacked knowledge and rather than consulting an attorney, took

the advice of strangers.

Judge BATTISTI replled, he was not

"convinced at all that the defendant testified before the GJ as

he did out of fear that he did not know the seriousness of

the matter. The crime was the most serious interference with the

orderly process or the administration of justice."

On 4/22/64, the FGJ, CV, Indicted the 3 DE NIRO brothers,

surviving brothers of bombing-murder Victim VINCENT J. DE NIRO,

who was killed on 7/17/61.

The 5 count indictment involved the

$391,627 estate of VINCENT J. DE NIRO and they are accused of

evading payment of $111,020 in estate taxes, in that they conspired

to defraud the U.s. by impeding lawful governmental functions of

the IRS, to commit

oftense by attempting to evade estate taxes, to

make false and ficitious statements and by aiding and abetting

in preparation of fraudulent statements and documents.
