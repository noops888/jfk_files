This informant 1s a white male, age 46, born in the

United States.

He is employed as a tool

and die

maker and has

been divorced since 1948. His former wife has custody of their

three children. The informant has a high school education.

This informant was active In the SWP In Chicago from

1944 to 1951, and from

late 1953 to the present time.

The services

of this informant have been of substantial value to the Chicago

Office In the investigation of SWP matters, inasmuch as he has

been able to furnish information regarding

leadership and policy

making matters in the Chicago SwP, as well as furnishing information

connected with the national activities of the SWP.

Chicago believes this

Informant would make a good witness

and there are no known factors which would reflect adversely on

his credibility as a witness.

It is noted that this informant

was

arrested in 1946 for picketing activities and was fined $1.00.

Chicago regards the long range value of this informant

as excellent and believes that disclosure of his identity would

substantially impair security coverage of the SWP on a local and

national basis.

This informant is not willing to testify

at this time because his son in presently

serving with an intelligence wint in the Us army

and he wishes to avoid embass assment to his son

and family members.

His background in the SWP covers a period of
