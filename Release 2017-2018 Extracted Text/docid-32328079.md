On October 11,/1957, HAV-4, who has furnished reliable

information in the past,

advised he had ascertained that individuals

associated with GEORGEÄLEVINE in the operation of the gambling

casino in the Mockey Club at the Oriental Park Rage Track near

Havana were BENNY\KRAKOWER, MIKEYLORIA and one JOE COSTELLO.

Both

KRAKOWER and LORIA are known to the Havana office as having had

previous affiliations with gambling operations in Havana; however,

Havana files contain no identifiable information concerning

COSTELLO.

HAV-4 indicated he had received information from one

source that LEVINE and the afore-mentioned individuals were not

paying any rent on the Jockey Club

since at the beginning of

the

racing season they had lent LOWELL BIRRELL, who has the concession

for the Oriental Park Race Track,

fifty

-thousand dollars and that

in lieu of paying interest on this money he had given them the

privilege of operating the casino at the

Jockey Club. 'While the

possibility exists that this is true, it should be, ngted that none

of these individuals is known to have

any substantia?

amount of

money in his own right. Therefore, the possipility exists that

this money may have been furnished

by MEYERS FANSIX
