INFORMANT PROGRAM

Informant was personally contacted on 3/25/64 by

SAS NEWTON E. YOST and J. G. WHITTINGTON, Jr.

Informant inmediately and positively identified

from a group of photographs the photograph of TAVeREDI 10RJ©Ra,

aka., Albert Bruno, ete., FBI # 799 369, as being identical

with the individual he had known as ALBERtO DANGEDO.

Informant advised that his acquaintance with

TANGREDI TORTORA was limited and that he had not seen him

in approximately 35 or more years.

As a Neapolitan, he would

pronounce a

"D" (DANGREDI rather than TANGREDI).

Informant noted that TAlCREDI JORTORA, during the period

knew him, used various names (apparently while in fugitive

status).

The name most commonly used, however, in informant's

experience, and the one he presumed to

be his true name, was

ALBERTO DANGREDO. Informant did recall, however, among the

names he had known TANGREDI TORTORA to

use at least on

occasion, were the following:

ALBERTO BRUNO

LUIGI MARINO

JOE CALCAGNIO

CLEMENTO ETTABELLO

LẬ 137-3483

It is noted that informant had previously advised

that TANGREDI TORTORA has a brother,

"PARTGI"

also presently

retaine in locaTfAtaly" No the Burtsu li earer upARts"

Informant stated this was Italian

Neapolitan for

records at Washington; D. C. List a brother named

for TANGREDI TORTORA.

In interview on 3/25/64, informant could add little

to the facts of this matter not already furnished by him. He did

recall the following:

JOHN ROSSELLI has never mentioned his first name to

informant.

Informant stated he first learned this from ROSSELLI's

mother.

ROSSELLI always thought a great deal of his mother's

welfare and always sent money, periodically, to her.

As well

as informant can recall, in about 1928, informant first went

back to Boston with money for the mother.

At that time, informant

contacted the mother directly and she would ask him,

"How is

It was

thus,

through ROSSELLI's family, not

through ROSSELLI, that he leamed his first name.

Informant continued to bring money from ROSSELLI

to his mother until about the late 1930s.

It was somewhere

around this time that the procedure was changed and THOMAS

LUCHESE handled the matter as previously described.

However,

the informant apparently, remained the emergency communication

link between ROSSELLI and his family.

About three

or so years ago, ALBERTO SACCO contacted

informant to advise him of the death of ANTONIO SANTANIELLO

and

the need to set up another procedure for the transfer of

Informant, in turn, contacted ROSSELLI.

ROSSELLI

sat one ironmant to handle the natter and the present

procedure was set up.

Informant recalled, on 3/25/64, that ROSSELLI's

mother was about 82 years old

and that her first name was

MARIA. He described her as short and stocky, born in Italy.

ROSSELLI's mother appears to be identical with MARIA

MADDALENA DiPASQUALE BUSCEMA on the basis of information

furnished by the Identification Division. Under number 2431535,

Alien Registration Card, executed 9/30/40, this individual listed

her birth as 12/22/80 at Buccheri, Italy.

LA 137-3483

Informant stated the name BUSCEMA was unknown to

him, but could be explained by a second marriage. DiPASQUALE

could refer to her maiden name.

Informant again advised on 3/25/64 that ROSSELLI's

mother resides in the Boston area with ROSSELLI's sister,

CONNIE.

CONNIE is married to a barber. Informant does not

recall CONNIE's husband's last name, but recalled his first

name to be "ANGELO".

Based on information furnished by the Identification

"CONNIE"

appears to be identical with CONCETTA JOSEPHINE

DAVIS ON CONGETTA SACCO, Fingerprinted 8/14/42 under the National

SACCO.

Defense Program, listed her birth as occurring on 10/7/18 in

Boston, Massachusetts.

Based on information furnished by the Identification

Division, ROSSELLI's brother,

ALBERTO SACCO appears to be

identical with ALBERT R. SACCO.

ALBERT R. SACCO was

fingerprinted on 6/11/42 under

the National Defense Program.

He listed his birth as occurring on 1/8/14 at Boston,

Massachusetts.

This matter is receiving preferred attention and

is being given maximum

security handling in the Los Angeles

office.

The Bureau will be immediately advised of all

pertinent developments.
