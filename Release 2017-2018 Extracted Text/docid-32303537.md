In the CAPOLINO apartment numerous hunting

rifles were displayed in racks.

The topic of hunting

was mentioned by the SAS and CAPOLINO voluntarily stated

that he was hunting in Canada during the Fall of 1965.

He did not, however, comment on who he was with and it

was felt that the SAS should not indicate any knowledge

of CAPOLINO's activities as reported by the RCMP.

CAPOLINO indicated a willingness to contact the

FBI should he be confronted with any illegal pressures in

his new location. He further advised that two of his

brothers would be remaining in the NYC area in the

construction field and before he left the area, he woul

talk to his brothers and advise them of the interest of the

FBI and assistance which can be obtained if the brothers

are confronted by illegal pressures by any labor unions

or other persons.

No fricher investigation being conducted.
