HARVEY:

, HARVEY confirmed the accuracy of the I.G. REPORT version of his

Initial discussion of Executive Action with BISSEII. (36-37; 6/25)

HARVEY testified that his "net impression" from the discussion with

BISSELL was that both Executive Action and the ongoing poison pill

assassination plot were "fully authorized and approved" (54; 6/25),

although no specific Individual in the "WHITE HOUSE" was mentioned.

(81; 6/25) HARVEY said that after his initial meeting with BISSELL,

he discussed the propriety and feasibility of assassination with se-

lected CIA officers, who generally expressed a "negative reaction."

(40; 6/25) After a subsequent meeting with BISSELL, HARVEY continued

to develop the assassination capability without mounting an operation

or communicating the objective to any potential asset who was being

assessed. (45; 6/25)

Chronology. HARVEY has notes (see attachment) of two meetings to

discuss Executive Action which he is "almost certain" took place in

1961. (51; 6/25) On January 25, he met with SIDNEY GOTTLIED, the new

Chief of CIA's Technical Services Division. On the following day, he

met with ARNOLD SILVER

who recruited agent QWIN - the only agent

HARVEY ever employed in Project ZRRIFLE (for the purpose of "spotting"

potential assets). (50-55; 6/25) HARVEY said that these meetings took

place after his Initial discussion of Executive Action with BISSElL,

thus placing that meeting in "early January.' (52; 6/25)
