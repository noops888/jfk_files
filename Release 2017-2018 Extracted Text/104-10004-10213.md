MEMORANDUS FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT. : Discussion with Warren Commission Stalf Member

REFERENCE: Letter from J. Lee Rankin, General Counsel of the

President's Commission, to Bas. Richard Helme

daed 3 July 1964

Wilh te A proval of C/SR and the DD?, I met with Mr. ".

David Slawson of lie staff of the President's Commission on the

Assassination of President Kennedy at 1400 hoars on sis date in

the Commission"s offices at 200 Maryland Aveque, N.E., Washington,

D.C. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss apparent inconsistencies

in material provided the Commission by ClA and i, te Departmert of

State which were called to our attention in a letteI from the General

Counsel of the Commission to Mr. Helms, dated 3 July 1964.

2. By way al introduction, Mr. Slawson said that in the portion of the

Commission's report that he was writing, he mould hare to deal with the

question of whetter or not the OSWALDs" departure from the USSR - and

the circumstances (i. e. timing) of that departure - sere unusual or

suspicious in any nay. He expressed his belief that ley probably sere

sot and cited Sorrist relaxation in such matters in tre post-Stalin era.

lowever, he saried to be sure in his own mird that our information sa

not in conflice sith that which the Commissior sad received from State

since all of that information would remain in lee records of the

Commission.

3. After stating my belief that there was to real disagreement or

inconsistency between the information from ClA and that from State, 1

expressed the vien that the matter resolved justil into three questions:

SEGRET

a. Do she Soviet authorities normally permit Soviet

citizens married lu forcign nationals lo emigrate from the

Soviet Union to the homelands of their spouses?

b.: Do they normally permit such Soviet cilizens to

ccompany (i.e. depart simullantously with) their spouse

from the Soviet Union 1

c. How long does it take such Soviet citizens to get

Soviet exit visas ior such a purpose (lime lapse from application

to granting of visas)?

1. Concerning the firet two questions (3a and 3b above) I [siuted out.

that we had addressed ourselves mainly to the question of Sovie: citizens

being allowed to accompany their spouses abroad while State dealt only

with the larger question of Sovicts married to foreigners being allowed

to emigrate without reference to whether or not they left simultar eously

with or at another time from their spouses.

Mr. Slawson commented

that this explanation was most helpful ard he reread what both ze and

State had said in that light.

5. By way of further explanation. I said that the statements is

paragraph & of our memorandum of 6 April 1964 concerning Soviets being

permitted to accompany their foreign spouses abroad were based on a

review of 26 cases, of which 10 involved Americans.. In only four of

these cases did a Soviet wife leave she USSR in the company of her foreign

husband; in 14 of the cases the foreign spouse departed alone; and in the

remaining seven cases insufficient details are known to permit 1s 19

categorize them. I added that although State's information began by

ciling the issuance of 724 quota and non-quota immigrant visas by the

American Embassy in Moscow during the period FY 1954 to December

1963, it did not indicate how many of these visas were for Soviet citizens

who had married U.S. nationals.

information for only sixteen cases and did not indicate in many of bese

whether or not the Soviet was permitted to accompany the foreige spouse.

16. In response lo

6.

In response to a question from Mr. Slauson I stated that most

of the 26 cases upon shich ve based our slatements involved foreign

students, exchange leachers and other relalively transient persons.

and while a number of cares have certain points is common, they bear

little similarity to the OSWALD case in that nome im olved a defector who

married prior to repatriating. I noted that paragraph 6 of our 6 April

1964 memorandum to tre Commission had pointed this out. Mr. Slawson

indicated that hg was now satisfied on this matter.

Concerning the length of time taken by Soviet authorities to

process exit visas for Soviet citizens married to foreign nationals

(question 3c above), I stated that, in my opinion, the information

provided by State (in the third enclosure to MI. Meeker"s letter)

substantially corresponded to the viess expressed in paragraphs 6 and 7

of our memorandum to the Commission dated 6 April 1964. Mr. Slawson

asked if it would be possible to elaborate paragraph 7 of our memorandum

of 6 April by providing & statistical breakdous of lhe cases on which our

statements were based. I indicated that this could be done.

8. At this point M5, Slawson stated that as a result of our discussion

he felt that the question of possible inconsistencies had been resolved.

However, he asked that de send a brief written reply to the Commission's

letter of 3 july 1964 embodying the substance of what I had said concerning

the baris for statements included in pur 6 April 196% memorandum. (This

would include the gist of the draft reply to the Commission which I showed

to C/SR on 8 July plus an elaboration of our statements concerning Soviet

visa applications. ]

9. Mr. Slawson indicated that he sould be sending parts of his report

dealing with the Soviet intelligence services to CIA for checking as to

their accuracy. He did not say when this would occar.

10. After concluding the meeting with Mr. Stamsor, I read Volume 52

of the transcript of testimony before the Commission.

Jas included the

reinterview of Marina OSWALD.

On his second trip to the USSR in Jamary 1959, Philip Robert

NELSON,

was glven an INTURIST Interpreter/guide named

Tamara Stepanovna KUNGUROVA, A romance developed tetween them and NIELSON

became deterined to marry her, uhich he finally did in the spring of 1962.

Ble famtly did everything in their pover to discourage this romancò and John.

Hones of the State Deptartment received letter Iron HIELSON's lather so

affair Not seeking help but advice on what to do.

NIELSON later received letter from his father in fall 1960 giving in

details the contents of a conversation father had had uith John Hanes of State.

Henes stated that:

a All American-Soviet marriages had turned out to be unsuccessful.

b. The Soviets never let one of their netionals out of the country under

such circumstances unless the person had been recruited as a spy.

c.The Soviets will probably not given NIELSON & visa (he tried unsuccess

fully all sunmer and fall 1960 and in 1961 to get Sor visa) •

With regard to the marriage of a Soviet to a foreigner, fore

ACRSENKO(who werried a Britiah diplount in the 191010) has this

to say:"Host of the sonen who bave married foreigners must have agreed

at one time of another to carry out some cort of spy work for the Sovlote.

Otherwise, they would not have been given permlanion to marry foreigners,

" for even the marriage certificato has to be losued by the secret polloa."

Nora, herself, was recruited by State Security through coercion and orly

alloved to leave the country by agreeing to work for Sumiat State Security.

This nha never diaberaul,

ince out of the country, she broke completely with

the Soviets ard it is presuned that she has furnished Information on

sel

that organtzatlos to the British Servises. (* Spled for Stalin, by

Nore Murray).

Petr DERYABIN, State Security officer who defected in 1954, has this

to say about the Soviet women who have contact with or who marry foreigners:

Sovlet woren associating with foreign men will be recrulted by State Security

when the association is first beguy, or after it has developed, or when plans

for marriage heve been made. " Even if only 5% of these varen are 100%

loyal State Security workers, and the otbers

work less loyally, It is still

considered a worthubile operation.No voran known to be anti-Sovlet would

ever be given a visa to leave the country, even 1f she were married to an

ambassador The Soviets Instruct all persons in this category to make remarks

againat the Soviet Union when abroad, but these remarks are not te be too strong,

nor are they made for publication"by press or radlo."

In the tarly 19609s, when ayoung American was thinking of carrying an

INTURIST guide, his father contacts a Inowledgeable official of the State

Department who made the following remarks:

1. All Averican-Soviet varrisges had turned out to be unguccesful
