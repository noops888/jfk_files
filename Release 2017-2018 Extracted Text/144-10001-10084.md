REPORT FROM WASHINGTON IN IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF PRESIDENT'S

DEATH

Msg Nr: -

Prince BERNHARD: left Washington on Monday evening, since

he had to be back in the Netherlands early Tuesday without fail.

Before leaving, he was able to see Mrs. KENNEDY, who received

all the distinguished guests in the White House after the funeral.

The Prince was treated with especial courtesy by the Chief of

Staff of the Air Force General LEMAY, who called in person at the

Embassy to take him to the airport, where he made a plane available

to fly him direct to Zolsterberg.

Princess BEATRIX, after visiting the White House, attended

the reception at the State Department, where she spoke atesome

length with Mrs. JOHNSON, who was seated between the Dutch

Princess and Queen FREDERIKA of Greece.

Mr. LUNS: left at about 1300 on Tuesday. We had a brief

talk with him that morning.

He believes that RUSK will now come

more to the fore, because of JOHNSON's previous preoccupation

with domestic politics. He considers it a favorable; omen that

the new President recently spent three days in Holland. LUNS

assuines that there will be no abrupt change in American policy,

but one must be prepared to note nuances. Officially, JOHNSON

has always conformed to KENNEDY's policies, but he has always

been a few degrees more conservative, and it remains to be seen

how much of his earlier outlook will carry over.

The White House atmosphere will undoubtedly change, for it is

hard to believe that personal collaborators of KENNEDY such as

BUNDY and SCHLESINGER will be on the JOHNSON team. The influence

of ROSTOW, the planning head in the State Department, could decline,

as will, of course, that of ROBERT KENNEDY.

At the Monday evening reception in the State Department,

JOHNSON had a cordially interested greeting for each guest.

He had a two-handed handshake for LUNS, who was a accompanied by

the Princess and VAN ROIJEN. The former received hearty applause

from the crowd when she left the building.

Americans are deeply appreciative of DE GAULLE's coming

to Washington, but LUNS has not got the impression that there

will be a change inithe American attitude toward France.

At the reception, LUNS had rather long conversations with

ERHARD and Indonesian Defense Minister NASUTION, with which he

was very satisfied.

ERHARD had just visited Paris, and it can

easily be guessed what he and LUNS talked about.

LUNS will remain Wednesday in New York. He will arrive in

Amsterdam on Thursday morning and go direct to Strassburg, where

the European Parliament seems quite anxious that he speak as

soon as possible.

On Tuesday, RUSK had talks with several important visitors,

including MIKOYAN, ERHARD, and HOME. He also received a group

of Latin American representatives. In all these talks the

President ((B)) assured his guests that American policy toward

their countries would not change.

On the same day, many people visited President KENNEDY's

grave across the river. Queen FREDERIKA laid an olive wreath

as a symbol of peace.

On Wednesday, President JOHNSON will deliver to the

Congress a speech which is awaited with interest. However, it

does not seem likely that he will hold a press conference this

week, since Thursday is Thanksgiving Day. This was xiginally

a festival of thanks for the harvest, and later became a day of

general thanksgiving. This year it will be an unprecedentedly

somber day for America. What one can be thankful for at this

moment is that political institutions provide for a quick and

peaceful take-over in the event of the sudden death of the

President.
