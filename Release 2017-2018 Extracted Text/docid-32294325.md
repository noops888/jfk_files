AR, " 12/4/61.

ReBuairtel captioned "SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR., aka.,

Enclosed is a cable print and a print of a connector

circuit.

The cable print entitled "PL 6x-1033 MDW wire to

serve area adjacent to 50th St. & Puritan Rd. " covers the

area in the vicinity of the home of JOE DIEZ. This cable

from the intersection of 50th St. and Puritan Road was!

installed when service was requested by DIEZ for his new

home, which is located at the end of this cable. The cable

was installed in order to provide spare pairs to the subject's

home for possible use of the FBI.

The installation is a com-

pletely normal installation inasmuch as this area is an open

field and it would seem logical that more construction would

occur in the area.

Old wiring to the EARLIEZ residence and

the residence of

FRANK A.XGONZALES was replaced by this new

construction and they are served from this same cable.

DIEZ is a brother of JOE DIEZ, and FRANK A. GONZALES is married

to their sister CONCHITA.

The entire open field is owned by

members of this family.

A plant site has not been selected.

A residential

area exists

in the general area of 50th Street and Puritan

Road. Some houses have been available in this area and it is

contemplated that any plant site would be located in this general

area provided the installation could not be covered from the

office of the FBI.

A measurement of the resistance needed to bring up

dial tone on the party line which was to be assigned to the

subscriber was made at the intersection of 50th Street and

Puritan Road, shown on the cable diagram.

The outlet box was

located on a

telephone pole at this location.

The print of the connector circuit entitled "CONNECTOR

CIRCUIT local & toll - 2 digit - terminal per station -

controlled ring" is the print of connections in the company

which would be associated with the subscriber's telephone.

Regarding tests previously made to determine

resistance which would bring up dial tone, these tests

were made on a party line.

The telephone company was able

to upgrade the subscriber's service and he was placed on a

private line as a result of the new cable installation.

Instead of the USC type 80 telephone, a white Starlite

telephone with extension bell was installed for the subscriber.

The bell rings on a frequency of 30 cycles at 130 volts.

An emergency power failure generator would furnish 120 volts

at 30 cycles to this telephone.

This change to private line service would make

necessary a recheck of the resistance needed to bring up

dial tone. It is noted, however, that the new@pily device l

which can

be installed in the subscriber's home, recently

developed by the FBI Laboratory, would make further resistance *

measurements unnecessary.

It is believed that installation of

this device in the subscriber's home other than in the telephone

will be more practical in view of the limited space available

in the Starlite telephone and because the subscriber has several

telephone outlets in his home where connecting wire would be

available.

Tests to determine the effect of connecting a 3, 000-ohm

resistor across the subscriber's line were made on both party

lines using the HSC type 80 telephone and the Starlite telephone

with extension bell.

The test on the HSC type 80 telephone

revealed that the 3,000-ohm resistor made a very noticeable

change in the ringing sound of the telephone.

The ring sounded

muffled. It made no noticeable change in the level of the talk

or listen current at the subscriber telephone or at the calling

party telephone.

The same test on an installation where the

Starlite telephone and extension bell were used made no notice-

able difference in the ringing or in talk or listen conditions.

It is felt that the new SPMT device would be ideal for use with

the HSC type 80, or the Starlite telephone as compared to the

SPNT previously available.

SEPARET

With regard to information requested in referenced

communication,

information has been obtained as follows:

The normally closed

i as vide

ringing relay that will respond

to the ringing frequencies of the lines involved is the

Relay" available through the Automatic Electric Company.

The ringing voltage is 130 volts, as stated above,

with 120 volts available under emergency conditions. Ringing

frequency is 30 cycles.

The talk voltage is 48 volts with the operating

current dependent upon resistance in the circuit.

It was

calculated that the current at the subscriber's line would

be about 54 ma depending upon the position of the carbon

granules in the microphone.

the subscriber's line was not available, but measurements

made on a similar line under actual conditions revealed a

40 ma current when the handset was removed from the hangup

position.

The two HSC type 80 telephones previously submitted

to the Bureau should not be altered and should be returned to

the Tampa Division for return to the telephone company after

the FBl Laboratory has examined the telephones and made tests

for possible RFMT/use as was previously requested.

The telephone number assigned to the subscriber is

WE 8-1209, working out of a substation in Temple Terrace, Florida.

SPMT electronic switching technique employs the same

unit. From a review of the cable plan submitted with your letter of

1/10/62 it is assumed that the cable described in cable plan PL6X-1933 is

a 6-pair, 19 gauge, Multi-pair Distribution Wire which connects to the

feeder cable at 50th Street and Puritan Road.

I this is the case, it will

¿bel to the Bureau's advantage to locate a plant in close proximity to tis

point so as to reduce to a minimum the wire which will be added to the

subscriber's transmission loop as a result of the insertion of the SPMT

switching unit.

implier, you should turnisn the baboratory wit

the instrument to your ortice:

The Laboratory will furnish you with/two electronic switches;

each complete with an amplifier and a microphone and in addition, two

SPMT switchinglunits and special relays to open the audio path when the

line is used for telephone conversations.

The telephone instruments previously submitted to the Laboratory

are being returned via registered mail.

In the event your survey indicates that a MISUR can be securely

Installed, you should submit a request for installation authority.

NOTE: Tampa has authority to conduct MISUR survey on subjects in

captioned case. They proposed the use of RFMT type of coverage, but

Laboratory tests indicate that tephone sets used for subjects cannot

be activated by/RFMT Junit. Tampa next considered(SPMTtype O80 CU

installation. Laboratory questioned effect of such a low value of jurper

resistor, required for this type of installation, should have on

ringing of telephones in the area. Tests in Tampa substantiated

Laboratory theory re effect on ringing.

Tampa advised of electronic

switch circuit and now desires to explore this technique.
