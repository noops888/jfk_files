Entry in "Historic Diary".

[DDP: 4-0864]

"1.

In a document entitled Historic Diary' there appears an

entry

which refers to

"an

elderly American'. The entry is under the date 26

October 1959 when OSWALD was allegedly confined in an unidentified Moscow

hospital.

It is apparent that every effort should be made to iden-

tify the elderly American, if he existed.'

We assume the lead is

still outstanding. It is our recommendation that the Department of State

urgently request through its channels a careful search of Embassy and Con-

sular records in Moscow which might reveal the Identity of an elderly

American hospitalized at the end of October 1959 and possibly registered

with the Embassy as a tourist. An independent confirmation of this de-

tail could be of freat significance in validating the entries of OSWALD's

'Historic Diary' and would possibly lead to the development of additional

information on OSWALD's stay in the USSR."

formation supplied by this Agency on the activities of lee Harvey OSWALD

"3. We surmise that the reference in OSWALD's letter of 9 November to a

man who had

since been replaced must refer to Cuban Consul Busebio AZCUE,

who left Mexico for Cuba on

permanent transfer on 18 November 1963,

days before the assassination.:

AZCUE had been in Mexico for eighteen

years and it was known (to us) as early as September 1963 that he was

His replacement did arrive in September. : AZCUE was schedu

led to leave in October but did not leave until 18 Novemberl

"4. We do not know who might have told OSWALD that AZCUE or any other

Cuban had been or was to be replaced, but we speculate that Silvia DURAN

or some Soviet official might have mentioned it if OSWALD complained about

AZCUF's altercation with him."

Documents on Lee Harvey: OSWALD Furnished by the Sovlet Govern-

\[DDP 4-1764]

"I.

The Soviet documents forwarded to this Agency under your letter of 20

May 1964 provide some additional detail on OSWALD.

The information in

these documents parallels that already available from other sources,

does not contradict our previous information. The documents do clarify

somewhat OSWALD's alleged occupation at the Minsk radio plant giving the

original Russian terms used in decsribing his job.

"2. The following points relating to the documents are worth noting:

A significant omission from the materials provided is the letter

OSWALD allegedly wrote to the Supreme Soviet requesting Soviet citi-

zenship..

"'B.

OSWALD signed a receipt in 1960 for his Identity Document for

Stateless Persons,

and a second receipt in 1962 for his Identity

Document for Foreigners.

The similarity of wording of the receipts

regarding his understanding of Soviet residence and travel regula-

tions further supports our belief that such regulations are identical

or nearly identical for bearers of either type of identity document.

This means that OSWALD should have obtained permission in July 1961

to travel to Moscow, but, as we know from other cases, failure to ob

tain travel permission is not uncommon and not a serioustoffense.

"C. The includsion of Marina's exit visa

'application' Is singular

in view of the fact that the Commission had not requested information

on Marina.

"d.

The Soviet translators for OSWALD's early documents are believed

to be identical with persons already referred to in OSWALD's 'diary"

The format and wording of subject documents appear to be consistent

with Soviet practice."

that the only direct flight from London to Helsinki on 10 October 1959 was

Finn Air flight 852 which arrived in Helsinki at 2333 (11:33 p.m.). If!

OSWALD had taken this flight, he could not normally have cleared customs

and landing formalities and reached the Terni Hotel downtown by 2400 (mid-

night) on the same day This is based on the judgement of officers in

this Agency familiar with the Helsinki airport.

"2. We are presently attempting to determine if OSWALD could have taken a

more circuitous flight from

with a stop

at Stockholm, Copenhagen,

or some other city.

Any additional infornation received will be forwarded

to you promptly."

He told me that he had lived in the USSR.

I would have to check before I could recommend him..

Statements Reportedly Made by George and Jeanne de MOHRENSCHILDT

Concerning Lee Harvey OSWALD and the Assassination of President Kennedy. 7

[DDP 4-3479]

"1.

Kennedy:

"ai

Shortly after the assassination of President

Kennedy, George and Jeanne de MOHRENSCHILDT were

among the guests attending a cocktail party in Haiti.

The de MOHRENSCHILDTs were asked if there was

any substance to the view expressed in certain foreign

periodicals such as L'Express, a left-wing Parisian

veekly newspaper,

that the Kennedy assassination was

a plot organized by Dallas millionaires. George de

MOHRENSCIILDT said that President Kennedy was hated

by the Dallas elite, and he felt that it was very

likely that certain

reactionary elements in Dallas had

organized a plot to get rid of Kennedy and used a dis-

turbed person such

as OSWALD to achieve their ends.

Mrs. de MOHRENSCHILDT agreed fully with this thesis.

"3. A copy of this memorandum is being forwarded to the FBI."

CSCI-316/00856-64 Subject: Lee Harvey OSWALD - Internal Secu

rity, Russia - Cuba. Reference:

Your Memorandum dated 28 July 1964.

A review of the results of monitoring Soviet foreign broadcasts at

the time when

an interview with lee Harvey OSWALD had apparently been

taped was conducted with negative results.

Therefore, it is assumed

that such a tape, if broadcast at all, was aired over a local USSR facili-

ty for internal consumption..

"2.

With respect to the same question, Yuriy NOSENKO was asked if any

attempt had been made hy the Soviets to exploit OSWALD for propaganda

purposes, such as Radio Moscow broadcasts, telecasts, or lectures.

NOSENKO replied that this had not been done either in Moscow or in Minsk.

Memorandum for Mr.

Lee RANKIN, General Counsel etc.

Subject: Konstantin Petrovich SERGIEVSKY

[DDP 4-4479]

The files of this Agency

contain no identifiable traces on Konstantin

Petrovich SERGIEVSKY or on his sister.

112.

We have no information which would either confirm or refute allega-

tions that Lee Harvey

OSWALD made one or more visits to the city of Gorky

in April and May 1960 or at any other time.

The term 'mokrym delam' which appears in the notes which SERGIEVSKY

brought with him to the British Embassy may be translated 'wet affairs' or

'liquid affairs'.

It is an expression or jargon used by the KGB. to refer

to activities involving kidnapping or assassination.

RANKIN asked for Agency comments concerning allegations of a Soviet

citizen Konstantin Petrovich SERGIEVSKY, who walked into the British

Embassy in Moscow on 29 July 1964.)

Subject: Joachim JOESTEN

[DDP 4- 5110]

Attached are reppoduced copies of a set of German documents seized by

the U.s.

authorities

at the end of World War II.

The documents concern

1964. The captured documents in this set range in

dates from July 1936 to November 1937 and contain the statement that

JOESTEN had been a member of the Communist Party of Germany since 1932.

You will note that the attention of the German security organs was direc-

ted at JOESTEN as early as 1936.. At thatstime the Communist Party had been

been outlawed in Germany and the German authorities apparently had begun

collecting information about JOESTEN and his activities.

Their investiga

tipp seems to have culminated in the proposal for revocation of his Ger-
