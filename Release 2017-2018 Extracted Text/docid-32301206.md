SUBJECT:

Remyairtel 2/5/62, and reBuairtel 2/7/62.

On 2/19/62, Special Agent JOHN SHWARTZ, Intelligence Division,

IRS, Pittsburgh, Pa., advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH III as

follows:

SCHWARTZ was in Chicago, Illinois 2/14-16/62, awaiting his

turn to testify as a Government witness in the case "BERNARD

J. EZHAYA, et al; ITSP-MT."

AUSA MANION, Chicago, told

SCHWARTZ that he expects to use JOSEPH MEROLA, Former Miami

ILL.

C1, as a witness for the Government,

and" it is fully believed

AOTHER 4

that defendant WILLIAM RABIN will take the stand and impli-

cate his co-defendants, Including SAMUEL MANNARINO. 14 .

It is noted that both MEROLA and RABIN have been associates

and friends of the MANNARINOS for many years.

The above

information from Schwartz was furnished the same day by SA

FORSYTH to Departmental Attorney JOHN MULLANEY.

MULLANEY stated that he believed that it would be better to

postpone the interview of

Jat Federal Penitentiary,

Lewisburg, Pa., until after MEROLA and"RABIN testify. He

said he felt that the

a selling point with

testimony of these two men might be

to demonstrate that others were

"turning on the MANNARINOS

to save themselves."
