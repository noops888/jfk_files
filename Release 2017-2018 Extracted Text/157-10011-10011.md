OCCURRENCE: In a memo of June 24, 1966, Director of Security for the CIA, Howard J.

Osborn set forth the facts involving the Maheu-Rosell affair.

The facts are as follows:

In August, 1960, Richard M. Bissell approached Sheffield Edwards to determine if the

Office of

Security had assets that may assist in a sensitive mission requiring gangster-

type action. The mission target was the liquidation of Fidel Castro. Because of its

extreme sensitivity, only a small group was made privy to the project. The DCI was

briefed and gave his approval.

Col. J. C. King, Chief, WH Division was briefed but all

details were deliberately concealed from any of the JMAVE officials. Certain ISD and

COMMO personnel participated in the initial planning stages, but were not witting of the

purpose of the mission.

Cuba on 30 Oct and again on 31 Oct so that I could give a firm report to Dept. Sect.

OCCURRENCE: Lansdale states, "at 16:50 tonight, Lt. Col. Patchel informed me that

Bob Hurwitch of State had just telephoned to report that Radio Havanna reported the

capture of a CIA sabotage team at the Matahambre mines.

Lansdale was in a staff meeting at the time and he asked Patchel to check the truth

of the information with CIA. Patchel informed Lansdale at 1705 that he had talked

to Bill Harvey who reported that sabotage teams (of 4 and 2 men each) had departed

the Us on 17 Oct and gone in on 19 Oct, made an attempt, gone into hiding when the

exfiltration point was cut off; they had remained in hiding until 2 Nov, when they

were picked up.

OCCURRENCE:

With regard to paragraph 2 of Lansdale's memorandum to SGA dated 14 Nov.

1962 Harvey states: "The statement that Operation Mongoose had had no information on

this operation since early October was patently false.

Specific references made to the

pen ultimate paragraph and Lansdale's memorandum concerning a report for the CIA which he

used as a basis for memorandum dated 31 Oct.

a telephonic conversation on the evening of 30 Oct. 1962 between Lansdale and Cheeves

which is referred specifically in paragraph 2 on pages 7 and 8 of my reference memorandu.

I have discussed this matter in detail with Cheever and clearly recollects that his

conversation with Lansdale on that date took place as reflected in my reference memorandum.

Miscus tons to the sonion

During this conversation there was no discussion of previous operations except a brief

discussion of the COBRA and ANton teams and Lansdale did not ask, according to Cheeves

recollection, any specific questions concerning assets inside or prior operations which

Operation MONGOOSE."

Hard intelligence coverage of Cuba has been developed. Fifty-nine

controlled agents inside of Cuba exist.

Not so successful on infiltrating intelligence

reporting in resistence cadre teams. Failure to meet the original schedule of team in

filtrations primarily was due to two factors:

"(a) Lack of policy approval by higher

authority to make any extensive utilization of Department of Defense personnel and support."

"Had we ben permitted to mount a more intensive and agressive, the original infiltration

schedule probably would have been met, possibly exceeded."

The speed and extent of future

infiltration teams for resisitence purposes into Cuba "will of course depend upon policy

approvals by higher authority and the amount of support we can count on thereunder."
