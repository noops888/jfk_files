DAILY SUMMARY

CG SIX FOUR NINE EIGHT DASH PC ADVISED THIS DATE THAT

IN RECENT CONTACTS WITH PERSONS CLOSE TO SAM GIANCANA HE

HAS LEARNED THAT A GENERAL FEELING OF APPREHENSIVENESS

PERVADES THE GIANCANA ORGANIZATION. FEW REMARKS ARE BEING

MADE BY ANY OF THESE PERSONS AS TO THEIR OPINIONS REGARDING

WHAT GIANCANA PLANS TO DO IN THE FUTURE IN REGARD TO THE

RUNNING OF THE CHICAGO CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION. THIS INFORMANT

ADVISES THAT GIANCANA IS GIVING NO DIRECTIONS TO HIS

UNDERLINGS AND AS A RESULT THE GENERAL SITUATION IS IN A

STATE OF CHAOS. IT IS POINTED OUT THAT ADDING TO THIS

GENERAL STATE OF CONFUSION GIANCANA HAS ABSENTED HIMSELF

FROM THE CHICAGO AREA FOR THE PAST

TEX

HAS GIVEN NO INDICATION AS

REC- 60

MANY OF CHICAGO-S HOODLUMS, THAT GIANCANA-S DEPARTURE

WAS CAUSED BY A FEAR THAT THE FBI WOULD REINSTITUTE THE

SURVEILLANCE UPON HIS DAILY ACTIVITIES AND WOULD AGAIN

steer v..

LEAVE HIM IN A POSITION WHERE HE WOULD BE UNABLE TO GO

77475-7997 + 153444909745299509992959945-2229752 MeTe 1,1

BOUT HIS DAILY ACTIVITIES IN AN UNHAMPERED MANNER

ACCORDING TO

GIANCANA, IN CONVERSATION WITH

OTHER HOODLUMS, HAS INDICATED THAT HE IS CONSIDERING

LEAVING THE COUNTRY VITH A POSSIBLE DESTINATION BEING

BRAZIL. THE CHICAGO DIVISION FEELS THAT THIS INFORMATION

crimes -

HAS SOME MERIT BASED ON THE COMMENTS OF MURRAY HUMPHREYS

MADE IN THE PAST THAT GIANCANA SHOULD ATTEMPT TO DO

EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO GET AWAY FROM THE FBI SURVEILLANCE

AND TO REMAIN IN SOME LOCATION WHERE SUCH SURVEILLANCE

COULD NOT BE REINSTITUTED. IT IS- FELT THAT A STRONG

POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT A RECENT MEETING HELD AT STALEYS

RESTAURANT BY NINE OF CHICAGO-S LEADING HOODLUMS WAS

PROBABLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DECIDING HOW GIANCANA SHOULD

GOVERN HIMSELF BASED ON CURRENT HAPPENINGS. IT IS FURTHER

FELT HIGHLY LIKELY THAT A DECISION WAS MADE IN WHICH IT

WAS RECOMMENDED TO GIANCAN THAT HE LEAVE CHICAGO. 4

CONTINUED THAT BECAUSE OF RECENT PUBLICITY

ATTENDENT UPON THE HOODLUM SITUATION IN CHICAGO MARSHALL

CAIFANO IS ALSO MAKING PLANS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY.

ADVISED THAT ASIDE FROM THE GENERAL CONSTERNATION CAUSED BY

THE GIANCANA SITUATION IT HAS BEEN LEARNED BY THE HOODLUMS

THAT INTERNAL REVENUE IS REPORTEDLY GOING TO INDICT THREE

CHICAGO HOODLUMS SOMETIME PRIOR TO THE END OF THIS YEAR. •

THE NAMES OF THESE HOODLUMS ARE UNKNOWN THEREBY CAUSING

A GREAT DEAL OF ANXIETY AMONG AT LEAST A HALF A DOZEN OF

I THE LEADING HOODLUMS. U

THAT ALDERISIO STATED THAT RECENT NEWSPAPER PUBLICITY

HAS VISIBLY SHAKEN ALDERISIO WHO IS CONVINCED THAT FEDERAL

ACTIVITY IN CHICAGO AREA AND RESULTING PUBLICITY IS PRELUDE

TO NUMEROUS FEDERAL INDICTMENTS. HOODLUMS BELIEVE PURPOSE

OF PUBLICITY TO SWAY PUBLIC OPINION AND FAVOR FUTURE FEDERAL

PROSECUTIONS. 4

SAME SOURCE ADVISED JIMMY ALLEGRETTI TOLD SOURCE THAT

ALL BRANCHES OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE WORKING TOGETHER

AGAINST SYNDICATE AND POINTED OUT RECENT FAST ACTION OF
