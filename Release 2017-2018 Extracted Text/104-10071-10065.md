Forwarded herewith is a pamphlet prepared by the Japan

"Peace for Vietnam" Committee (BEHEIREN) for distribution to U.S:

servicemen stationed in Japan or visiting Japan. BEHEIREN activists

are distributing these pamphlets outside major U.S. bases throughout

Japan.

BEHEIREN had planned to drop copies of this pamphlet over

the USS ENTERPRISE and the U.S. Navy Base at Sasebo during the

ENTERPRISE's visit there this month. However, this planned action

fell through due to BEHEIREN's inability to obtain the cooperation

oI a Japanese newspaper, NAMI rUSH See catining a

helicopter for the exercise.

POFRAGRANCE1 obtained this pamphlet

from BEHEIREN beadquarters in Tokyo on 16 January.

propaganda poster, was not designated MHPASHA but might appropriately

have been so designated.

AKAHATS, Sunday edition, 21 January (identical article also appeared

in AKAHATA daily, 13 January) .

placed in the Chicago Daily News, May 1967.

advertisement was sent to GENSUIKYO by Fred Bachiyuruta (phonetic),
