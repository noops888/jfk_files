(1)

Agents have no jurisdiction in foreign countries.

limitations border office Agents may, through liaison with

cooperative foreign agencies in adjacent countries, arrange

for investigations

This should be done in

a circumspect manner to avoid any allegation of a violation

of the sovereignty of the foreign country.

Where interviews

are conducted in a foreign country in the

presence of and/or

at the request of a Bureau Agent, the Bureau Agent should

insure that the person interviewed understands that the interview

is being conducted by authority of the officer of

the host

country and not the agent.

This should not preclude the Agent,

where proper, from discreetly assisting the foreign officer in

extracting all information of Bureau interest during

the

interview.

Bureau Agents bave no

jurisdiction in foreign countries, no

power of arrest, search, or seizure and must be most circumspect.

They are not to be present at the scene of

an arrest by foreign

authorities, participate in or be

present during searches

Incidental to such arrests, accompany foreign officials trans-

porting prisoners, or

participate in interviews of prisoners

[Offices along

the Canadian border through liaison with coopera-

tive Canadian law enforcement agencies handle Canadian leads

in

criminal matters where time is of the essence and in criminal

matters of local interest. Leads on security matters where time

is of the essence or where previously approved by the Bureau

are

handled with RCMP by border offices on a divisional headquarters

While the RCMP is exclusively charged with investigation

of security matters in Canada, not all personnel are indoctrinated

in the handling of these matters and personnel at detachment

levels nay not be is a position to redder adequate assistance. (5)
