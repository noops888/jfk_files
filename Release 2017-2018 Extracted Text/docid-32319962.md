FBI documents.

The FBI has a limited mandated time frame in

which to appeal these decisions.

On:

10/01/2017

Enclosures: (U) 1. Evidence provided by the JFK Task Force in

support of maintaining the postponement, and the documents with

the FBI postponements highlighted. That information bracketed in

red is what the ARRB sustained.

(U) 2. A copy of the, operating procedures voted on

by the ARRB.

Details: (U) On 6/18/96, the ARRB formally advised, by letter

to the Director, the determinations voted by them on FBI

The ARRB letter

will list 101 documents 'for which the ARRB made determinations.

The

all of the information requested by the FBI or to open the

documents in full.

The release of the information in these 61

documents will reveal the identities of 158 individuals who were

described as potential criminal informants (PCI), potential

security informants (PSI),

security informants (SI), Cuban

sources, sources of information (SOI), confidential

sources (CS)

panel sources and established sources; release foreign

counterintelligence information.

(U) The ARRB held a public meeting 6/5/96, and voted on

new operating procedures.

The rules will decrease the number of

members needed to make a quorum to three. This may impact the

forthcoming decisions for the FBI, since a vote only takes

majority.

Two of the ARRB members normally present at meeting

are very pro-disclosure oriented.

(U) The 61 documents pertaining to the decisions from

the current meeting, which the FBI may wish to appeal, are listed

below by document number with the information to be released.

The current status of informants and sources, if found through

research, is noted after the name with living (L), deceased (D),

no record (NR) or date of birth (DOB).
