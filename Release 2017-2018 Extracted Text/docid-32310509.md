Mexico from Chicago usually communicates with him and that none

of. those having done so, whouwould be in a position to know if

SHETSKY were in Mexico, have stated that he is presently in this

country.

With reference to LEO

FRIEDMAN, he/explained that LEO

FRIEDMAN visited him in the latter part of July and remained at

his home for approximately five days. According to JONES, during

the time FRIEDMAN was in Mexico, he did not mention SHETSKY. |

Continuing,

JONES related that FRIEDMAN is presently in Chicago

again and although he does not know his present address, he can

be reached through his brother who is known as "BIG SNEEZE"

FRIEDMAN and is well known in Chicago.

•It will be recalled that in the report of SIS #7206

dated 7/18/46 at Mexico City, it was indicated that subject was

alleged to have stopped at the resort hotel in Ensenada, B. C.,

during May of 1946, although investigation during the month of July

failed to reveal any information indicating the presence of SHEISKÝ

in that area.

Continued investigation at both Tijuana and Ensenada,

Baja California

presently director of the magazine "Detective Internacional"

has failed to reveal any Information of value in instant casé.

FRANCISCO, ORBE ALEANA who is presently incarcerated

in the Tijuana CIty Jait and who was, interviewed in connection with

he investigation of BENJAMIN "BUGS!

*SIEGEL and reactivation of the

CAPONE Gang from September I to September 6, 1946, when questioned

nor did he ever recall MAX COSSMAN, for whom he worked and who

'acted as SIEGEL's front man' for illegal activities in Tijuana,

ever mentioning that SHETSKY was in that area.

According to

GALEANA, he is certain that if SHETSKY had been in that area, he

would have contacted COSSMAN, as

nearly all the Chicago racketeers

or west coast mobsters would

visit COSSMAN whenever in Tijuana.
