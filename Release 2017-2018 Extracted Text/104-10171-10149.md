reached this state only at the very last stages of its existence. In

this sense the world of the concentration camp develops like a

cancer within society, corrupting the executioner along with the

victim.

A CALL TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

We are laced with an international crime and we must

say so as clearly as possibile.

Our allies in the struggle for

Out of the cacophony of the thousands of documented reports

the: "concentration camp man"

emerges.

He is nightmarishly

typical.

He is hungry, sick and afraid. He lives in wooden bar

racks, or under a tent, or in carth caves. His fate is locked be

tween barbed wire barricades, beneath observation towers.

Unde

constant threat of dogs and rilles, he works far beyord the powe

of his muscles. Given. neither the means nor time to wash, he wear

foul lags.

He is awakened before down; at night, having returnec

exhausted from work, he stands in an interminable line, near a hos

pital lacking medicaments. " In the middle of the night, in every

kind of weather, he is aroused by blows to unload freight cars. Thi

is a faithful condensation of hundieds of reports-and thousand

of such reports exist.

The world of the concentration comp keeps growing. Yester

day the Soviet Union had only political detention camps.

cruel civil wer of the collectivization period started her on this en

terprise of forced labor which plays its part in every economic see

very outskirts of Leningrad and Moscow to Baku.

During nearly their entire existence, the Nazi camps were bu

Onl

during the last years did they become an integral part of a siciet

THESE ARE THE FACTS:

Within the Soviet sphere, a system of concentration

camps exists, rivaling in extent and horror these of Nasi

Germany. President Truman has stated, on the best au-

thority arailable to him, that the Russians hold 16 million

hopeless human beings in these camps.

On the basis of thousands of documented reports.from

escapees from behind the len Curtain, the distinguished

Frsnich writer, David Rousset, issued his appeal to human-

ity, reprinted in abridged form above, for an investigation:

into the Soviet concentration camp system.

Mr. Rousset's demand deserves the fullest attention

of the American people. We of the Iron Curtain Refugee

Campaige hare therefore undertaken to make there facte

known as a publie serice. We will not keep silent before

¿this monstrous international erime, now driving thousands

of humar beings, destitute, through the Iron Curtain. Nor

shall me abandon those who flee the Soviet terror.

Therefore we call on the American people:

! (1) To join with Mr. Rousset in demanding an impartial

investigation of the Soriet concentration camp system.

(2) To support the Iron Curtain Refugee Campsign so Phat

cach vietim of this inhuman system fleeing to the West

can be assured of heip by those mho are dedicated to

the cause of human freedom and decency.

been a sourco of great spiritual encouragoment for the refugees in

PROBABLY SECRET

"Torge!

The US Government's Interest In tho rogrettable situstion In Iran

appears to do about 998 lumnitarian and only 2% intelligence.

since the problem 15 primurily lumnitarian, It rould seen to fall

under a now State Dept unit which got USy. 3 milion of lutual Security

funds to be spent in velfaro activitios among reluçees.

Although State is the aguncy of primary interest, I don't think we

need pass

this to State because this 1o un official united Netions matter,.

and presumably State already has accoss to thie sart of thin, through the US

dologation to the UN and through laison with the ON Secrotariat. I assuno

that the ner rofugee unit in Stato will survey the plight of rajugeos on tha

Soriot perinator, and in the course of this survey will obtain this info.

Ayray, it 1s not our

Job to colloct fion the uii and deliver to state.

I would suggest that those papers be given by memo to 0S0, which

might not otherwise got them.

1lso, you might as' OSo to call to the attention of the Chief,

Defector Coordination Branch, EE Division (tlat's Gale V. Allen) the paragruph

marked with a paperolio which says that Iran my have handed lack to the uSsR

35 Soviet avlators during 1951. If 35 Soviet fliers did shor up in Iran last

yesr, they were prime intelligence targots anil Gale ought to find out why

they were turned brek when the US would have taken them of Iran's hands.

Gale may be in this afternoon, and I'll tell hin you here this report.

Christocher Binet

Mender of the Board of the I.R.C.

Two years ugo the International Rescue Comnittee started Its

Iron Curtain Refugee Cunpuign under Adntral Byra, which has con-

tiaues under the Chairmanship of General Spantz.

response to an increasing need, the Committee launched an extended

program to raise funds to set up reception centers for refugees along

the Iron Curtain, to be krown as Frontler Freeson Stations.

head or the free burose comittee, as hailed this aro

vital and neglected phase of the fight aguinst Communist aggression.

Mr. Jackson pointed

out that one of the most successful subjects of

Soviet propaganda Was the neglect of the anti-Commist refugees in

the west, a neglect which mases a mockery of our professed sympathy

for the englaved peoples.

The Iron Curtain Campaign is not only necessary to encourage and

best use of the anti-Conmunist refugees,

it is also the most

dranstic and persuasive kind of anti-Communist propaganda in America

of those who risked their lives to choose freedon.

the greater for that reason.

Elinor Lioner,

whose book "Eleven Years In Soviet Prison Camps"

1s the most authentic document on Soviet slave labor,

has come to this

country to help raise funds for these Frontier Stations.

However, ber

fore her arrival, evidence of & whispering campaign against the Inter

national Rescue

Committee became clearly apparent.

Before the dinner

for Niss Lipper on October 3lst, which was addressed by General Wede-

Governor John Lodge of Connecticut and Mrs. Hiram Cole Houghton,

mere fa enter the General Federation of Women's Cluos, all the speakers

were confidentially approached in efforts to dissuade them from co-

operating with the Committee.

Most of the rumors and criticisms were based on the alleged nar

ror socialist nature

of the INC policy and personnel.

that the Frontier Stations would

It was also alleged that David Martin, Executive Director of the

InC, had once been an active member of the American Communist Party

under the name of David Levine, and that he had secretly changed his

nare to Martin in order to cover his Communist past.

The facts are that David Martin, Who was born and educated in

Canada; never had any connection with either the Canadian or the Amer

ican Cormunist parties.

He was a Socialist and was active in the

Canadian labor movement in his youth, but he was sever a Communist

and he is a Socialist no longer.

Dear Sir,

I sisb to acknowledge your litter of 21 A-guat 1951, in which you

set forth the interest

of the Harvard Univercity Library in eecuring cer-

tals docusests or microfiins tbereo! of individual displaced persons o.

refigees. who have been oi concern to the Interratioral Refugee O-ganiza-

I understand fully your interest in recuring these dociments. and

while I vould 11k; lu comply with your request I do not think it will be

possible to do so for reasors which I will set forth celow.

The quertion of docusentation of individual refugces and of ac-

cesc to such documente has veen a matter of concideraole controversy ever

since 1945, first in UNRRA and later in the IRO.

As à result of basic dif

ferences in political views concerning the hardling of displaced persons

and refugees it bag been recessary to asfeguard ali indi:idual dossiers

with the createst of care.

These dossiers contain not only facts about the

Individusl refugee and bie timediate fanily, vut also about his reistives,

many of who are not displaced persons and are chill in their countries of

As a natter of fact, the Organization bad a great denl of diff1

culty in securing the cooperation of individual dirplaced persons 1n cos-

pleting ou: Registration Forus, because of the fear thet there refugees bad

that such data night fall into

the hands of individuals, institutions or

goverments which might take sunitive action agairst relatives of displaced

persons refusing to return to their country of orizin. The IRO assured all

displaced persons that their perconal records and docuncuts vould he sale-

gunrded to as grent an extent as posaible and void be made availutle to

goverments only for the purpose of directly

assleting in securing the re

settlement acroed of the i:dividual concerned. We have attempted in every

wey to foller this policy consistently.

As ve approach the end o? IRO opcratione, ve are makiag plaus for

the

disposal of tbe Individual case records either by giving them to goverr

ments la the couatrles of reception, or y dectriction of the recoris. or

where the refugees are still in fernazy or Austrla, by turcing the documenta

over to the United Kations high Connissioner for Refugees. I regret tbere-

fore thas lu view of the security factors Involved, 1t will not to possible

to agree to jour proposal that certain oi these indliidual records be made

available to you for purpores of aistoricai researcia.

I might add, 1f you s1ll permit an expression of opision on the

aunject, that unless you were to secure a complete set of records, it is

Unfortunately, these Iron curtaln

They land

the International Refugee Onganiza-

tion equipped to handle their problems.

And unless some answer to their

needs is found soon, they will be com-

pelled to believe Russian propaganda

that western freedom is "Inerdom to

starve."

It is to be hoped that some oficial

program will eventually be evolved to

ald them in finding a permanent new

piace.

Their talents, like those of the

other D.P.'s, can certainly be used in

the mobilization mrlod ahead.

Pending such arrangements, how.

USSR "now' reported to do the sites of secret

charitable undertaking, but it serves to increase

the security of the United States and the remain-

der of the free world.

Editorial

'Freedom to Starve?.

Large numbers of Russian natural

scientists,

technicians.

and intelec

tuals, according lo

American Intelli

gence oficers,

would quit the Soviet

empire for the freer air of western

democracies if they could be sure of

jobs' to support themselves.

-The potential value of these people

with their knowledge and skille in the

struggle to protect the world against

Communist

tyranny is

•inestimable.

Some of them who recently have come:

through the Iron Curtain and to the

United States include a leading Rus

sian nuclear physicist and a promi-

nent oil gcologist. Many more, due to

the strictness of American immigra

tion laws, can get only as far as France

or West Germany.

Still others, with Information which

could be of immense value to the free

powers, would

like to leave Soviet

Russia or its satellites, but dare not

do so because they do not know

whether, being destitute, they can

find the means of survival. To them,

and to thousands who lately have

fied from Soviet-dominated countries,

Communist propaganda shouts that

"political freedom in the West means

"freedom to starve.'"

If that is all that awsits them, many

will accept terror and misery under

Communist rule rather than risk pov-

X Red home tien auton, howe

si the nicrnational Ressue Commi:

lee, lnc.; of dew

York: This voluntary

agency, headed by Gen. Carl Spaatz,

former chief of staff of the United

States Air Force, and supported by

privale contributions, is helping re

this organization, through its offices in

eight European

in new surroundings. Il enables them to

avoid the bitter fate or being compelled

by destitution to go back to their homes

behind the Iron Curtain. from which

they have endured much danger and

hardship to escape.

A humanitarian enterprise. the work

of the ICHC,

as it: becomes known to

people held in tyranny, has a definite

value in countering Soviet anti-American

propaganda. Among fugitives who have

been helped are men of scientific attain-

ments who have furnished important in-

formation about developments and con•

The campaign is financed by voluntary

contributions.

We would be a wretched nation indeed

Il we voiced our conviction that our

than those behind the Iron Curtain but

fulled to help the stream of refugees who

are constantly ficeing their Cammunist

Thal's why the Interna-

and that is why in is in the middle of

its fron Curtain Refusee Campaign.

This group is set up to help those who

manage to escape with their lives in

their desperate flight to freertom.

We must all help this good work. Gen.

Carl Spaalz, who is chairman of the can-

paign, put the situation in a lighe thit

"The wore which the canarion as da

Judging from the valuable informa-

and at least one Russian nuclear physi-

has a good point.

BERLIN (Western Sector):

In response to the Communist thraat to take over Berlin

by means of a Soriet Whitsuntide youth invasion last May, the

Iron Curtain Refugee Campaign launched "Project Berlin."

Replying to a special appeal, indiridual Americans and American

business enterprises contributed enough fo permit the shipment

of almost 4,000;000 Ibs. of butter, cheese, milk and egs ponder.

This aid and the continuing

sarrices of all kinds are administered by our Berlin office in the

tance berween themselves ond the Communist pollce apparatus.

Since there are no camps of any kind in the Paris area, Phe 60,000

refugies there are among the most destitute in Europe.

Hum-

dreds of these escapeeo come to the IRC' Iron Curtain Refugee

Compaign office every reception morning to ask for food parcels

or clothing or advice. On the buniest morning this yoar, 500 food

pnrcels were given out. Very frequently escapres are sided in

establishing themselves in amell businesses or in thair own pro

fession in France, or in arronging for their migration do other

countries where they can make a fresh start in life.

To assist in the work of the Paris offico, a Committes of

American ladios has been sot up under the patronage of Mrs.

David Bruce, wite of the American Ambassador to France.

The Committoe is nt present endenvoring to establist a hostel

that will provide emergoncy shelfer for new escapees arriving in

the Paris area.

The International Rescue Committee also maintains offices

in STOCKHOLM, BRUSSELS, ROME AND LONDON, "here the

samo humanitarion services are made available to Iron Curtain

retugees.

THIS VITAL WORK OF AID MUST CO ON. So long ae Sortet

Covernment and Individual Amerieans lo counteroet the big lie of

But truth la more

than worde. Undersourinhment, lack of decent clothing and shelter,

the lack of concrete evidence of Western support and approval,

could make there human beinge vulnerable to the continuous

streams of Soviet propaganda that political freedom in the Wert

TURKEY: Office in Istanbul.

For refugees coming from the Balkan countries and southern

Russia, Turkey is the nearest and in many cases the only country

which affords immediate asylum. To escape to Turkey phey must

cross some of the most perilous frontiers in the world. On the

Bulgarian frontier it. is estimated that 80% of those attempting

to escape are shot down. The hundreds that do succeed in escap-

•ing are completely dependent on the IRC's Iron Curtain Refugee

Campaign because this is the only American relief organization

which maintains an office in Turkey.

FRANCE: Office in Paris.

The Paris office has become one of the chief centers for Iron

Curtain refugees, because many of those who escape travel as

against Soviet Byranny will strengthen our country's prestige
