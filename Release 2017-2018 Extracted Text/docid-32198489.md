" Jan. 6

1964

"On Dec. 7, 1963 NOEL TOTTEN visited the

CLUDE MC DONALD at 1621 5th St.

North

Minneapolis,

Minnesota.

NOEL arrived about 11:00 A.M. and left his house

about 12:30 P.M.

They discuss

the assassination of President

KENNEY

and some of the questions on peace.

"MC DONALD

said that the reason the president was

killed was because of the hate campaign which hase been build

up

in this country over the past years. MC DONALD did not think

that there would be any change in the relation between the

united states and the u.s.s.R. as the present state of aIladIs

was not only President KENNEY'S

foelings, but also other

officers of the Government as well.

"MC DONALD ask

NOEL TOTTEN if he would take the

"Horker" and NoEL said that he would and would come back around

the

first of the year and give him money for a worker subscrip

tion.

"MC DONALD talked about the indictment of RALPH

TAYLOR and BETTY SMITH, saying that the judge desided to wait

until the HALL & DAVES case was settled before they would have

trial, if any.

"This 1s all I have to report."
