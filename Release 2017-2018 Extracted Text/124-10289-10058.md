Reference is made to your letter dated March 10,

1965,

your file 146-12-3212, and to our letter dated

15, 1965, both concerning the captioned case.

The matter, as outlined in your letter, was

discussed with Harry Zerbell, Bcononic Officer, United States

Embasay, mexico City, Mexico, on March 16, 1965, by our

Legal Attache there.

Zerbell advised that approximately three weeks

ago he was informed that a representative of the United States

Attorney for the Bastern District of Texas would come to

Mexico and contact him for the purpose of discussing this

case and the possibility of obtaining the documents referred

to in your letter.

Zerbell stated that as of March 16, 1965,

the United States

Attorney's representative had not come to

Mexico.

5223

Zerbell was of the opinion that it would be

premature at this time for our Legal Attache to contact

the Attorney General of lexico and he requested that we

take no action in this regard,until he receives additional

instructions from the United States Department of. Commerce

and from the aforementioned United States Attorney's office.

In view of the foregoing and in the absence of a

specific request from you, we plan to take no

further action

in-this natter at this time.

Mr. Herbert

J. Miller, Jr.

Assistant Attorney General

NOTE:

Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division; by

letter 3/10/65, requested our assistance in securing information

from Mexican Government in connection with a case being handled

by Department.

Subjects in violation of embargo shipped American-

made automotive parts from Texas to Mexico and

subsequently to

Cuba®

Cortez, who is President of Transcontinental S. A., was

granted prosecutive immunity and is scheduled to be a key

Governnent

He told USA for Bastern District of Texas

that art i documents this far real serve as corroboratare

evidence.

Cortez's tirig

however, has been liquidated and

liquidator has declined to show records to U. S. Government

representatives

AAG, in referenced letter,

indicated that

he

was aware our Legat was in contact with AG of Mexico on almost

daily basis and requested that we have our Legat reguest AG of

Mexico to persuade liquidator to make his records available.

AAG suggested we have our Legat contact Harry Zerbell, referred

to above.

In addition to information in this letter, Zerbell

confidentially told Legat that someone in Washington sometime

age approached CIA about obtaining Instant documents as cla

in Mexico City Bas

if necessary.

Legar auysseu at of nexico personally known te

him and would probably be cooperative in attempting tobbtain

documents providing framework of Mexican law would permit him to

do so.:
