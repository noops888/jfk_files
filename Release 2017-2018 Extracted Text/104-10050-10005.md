Background on Mexico Station Support Assets

coverege. From the time the Mexico Station was opened in

April 1947 (by Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1956, Charles

Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus

exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy. This umbrella type project

(LIFEAT)

consisted of multi line phone taps, three photo sites,

a nobile surveillance

team and a mail intercept operation.

a. Thone taps were placed by an employee of the telephone company

retireet the

who was handled by David WILSTED (pseudo). The number of lines •

tapped was inited by

noy availability of a listening post nearby

(since the taps were not made in the maincentra

and English/

Spanish (Soviet, Polish, Czech, etc) transcribers.

these agents (nostl le

pr Mexican American) were related

(which th

at that time felt was

good security in that

if they tallied about shop, they would talk to each other.)

b. Three photo sites were handled by Arderson with the help

of Harry Kahoney (retired, living in Chicago) and IDY ISD

people checking the best type of camera, film, and concealment

devices. These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LINITED, LILYRIC,

and LICALIA). LIMITED was a fixed site bang opposite across

the street fron the front gate of the Soviet Enbassy which had

both a vehicle and foot entrance. The Soviet gate was on the

Northl'est corner.of their compound and LIMITED was diagonally

across a double barrelled street on

the Southaas

one storey

this property. (a/Spanish Colorial stone house) through LINOUSIE (check to

be sure). Later this house began to fall apart.

This base was closed when

the Station got word that the photo of "uniden man" was being releasea to the

public by the Warren Connission. The photo operators vere noved to another apt

nearby. The property was sold (under an operational agreement with LIMOUSINE

for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment blding to be built

on this site).

LILYRIC was planned es an alternate photo base to LINITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the sare side of the street

as LEITED but in the middle of the block South. It had a slanted view of

the front gate of the Soviet Enbassy. The agents in LIATED and LILYRIC (both

lexican failies) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.

LILYRIC was a rented apartment. LICALIA, the third photo site, was located
