Mr. Helms' 3 June 1964 memorandum for the liarren Commission on

the de Mohrenschildts is attached at C.

It describes the Agency's

interest in obtaining reports from Mr. de lohrenschildt in 1957 as a

result of his sojourn in Yugoslavia that year.

Contact Division now

Domestic Coliection Division - DCD) had its resident agent in Dallas,

Mr. J. Walton Moore, contact Mr. de Mohrenschildt at that time.

(An OS summary on Mir. de Mohrenschildt

prepared in response to the current request is also attached at D.)

Our files show that a mail cover was placed on letters addressed

de Mohrenschildt c/o the U.S. Embassy in Haiti from about 1964 to

(This was probably not uncovered at the time of the external in-

vestigations.)This included opening and photographing the contents of

some letters by the CIA Station there.

The results of this operation

were shared with the FBI.

Mr. de Mohrenschildt came to the attention of this office during

the Rockefeller Commission investigations.

We were asked to respond to a

memorandum submitted to the Commission by Mr. Paul Hoch entitled "CIA

Activities and the Warren Commission Investigation."

Mr. Hoch called for

an identification of Mr. J. Walton Moore's employment affiliation and

asked what Mr. Moore knew about Oswald and what he may have told Mr. de

Mohrenschildt about him. Our reply to the Rockefeller Commission

attached at E.

The most recent information we have on Mr. de Mohrenschildt comes

from Mr. J. Walton Moore who was contacted in May and July 1976 by writers

connected with the Reader's Digest, and with the Dial Press and the Dell

Publishing Company.

Both writers questioned Mr. Moore about Oswald and

Mr. de Mohrenschildt. Mir. Moore's reports on these contacts are attached

at F.

Conclusions:

Mr. de Mohrenschildt appears to have lead an adventurous and

colorful life as a petroleum engineer and businessman.

He is both well

and poorly

connected, and some of his associations in the past have

raised serious questions.

Certainly his relationship with the

Oswalds has caused him considerable trouble and may have caused this

Agency and the FBI to spend more time and energy

on him in the past

than was necessary.

10..

Both the FBl and this Agency, however, had dropped their

interests in Mr. de Mohrenschildt's activities by the mid-to-late

1960's.. We speculate that any attention he is now receiving could

either be from local authorities in Dallas or from media representa-

tives on the trail of a warmed over story concerning the assassination

of President Kennedy. We offer no proof of this conjecture beyond

Mr. Moore's reports attached at F. What we can say is that we have

found no indication that either CIA or the FBI has taken any active

interest in Mr. de Mohrenschildt in recent years.

Dear George:

Please forgive the delay in my reply to your September 5th letter.

It took time to explore thoroughly the matters you raised.

Let me say first that I know it must have been difficult for you

to seek my help in the situation outlined in your letter.

• I believe I

can appreciate your state of mind in view of your daughter's tragic

death a few years ago and the current poor state of your wife's health.

I was extremely sorry to hear of these circumstances.

In your situation, I can well imagine how the attentions you

described in your letter affect both you and your wife..

However, my

staff has been unable to find any indication of interest in your

activities on the part of Federal authorities in recent years.

flurry of interest that attended your testimony before the Warren

Cormission has long since subsided.: I can only speculate that you

may have becone "newsworthy" again in view of the renewed interest

in the Kennedy assassination and, thus, may be attracting the atten-

tion of people in the media..

I hope this letter has been of some comfort to you, George,

although I realize I am unable to answer your question completely.

Thank you for your good wishes on my new job.

As you can imagine,

I'm finding it interesting and

challenging.

Very truly yours,

George Bush

George DE MOHRENSCHILDT

From the Office of Security

CIA CONNECTION:

DE MOHRENSCHILDT was security disapproved for OSS employ-

ment on 18 July 1942 because he was suspected of being a Nazi

agent. On 13 August 1958 derogatory information was furnished

the Contact Office who was interested in interrogating him as

an alien contact.. His second wife, Phyllis whom he married or

11 July 1948. and divorced 29 December 1949, was employed as a

receptionist by a covert project (NCFE) From 1950 to 12 January

1951 when her employment was terminated..

(Reason not given.)

Subject's brother, Dimitri S. VON MOHRENSCHILDT,

approved on 11 April 1950 for exploitation as a contact for

foreign intelligence purposes on a limited basis; not to receive

classified information above confidential.

OS INDICES RESULTS:

subject was

investigated by the FBI in 1941, 1942,

1945, 1947 and 1957.

Between 1940 and 1942 Subject was considered to be pro-German

A New York Times item for 12 December 1966 mentioned that

George DE MOHRENSCHILDT has been acquainted with Jacqueline

KENNEDY's father, John BOUVIER, and mother, Mrs. Hugh AUCHIN-

CLOSS, since Mrs. KENNEDY was a girl.

The DE MOHRENSCHILDT'S

with the Oswald case?

Answer:

Mr. J. Walton Moore was employed by CIA in the Contact Division

office in Dallas during the early 1960's.

His only contact

with the Oswald case

priox to the assassination is recorded in

his 1 May 1964 memorandum to the Acting Chief, Contact

Division, attached at Tab 8 la typed version of the document

is also attached because of the poor legibility of the

original).

He may have been involved in the Agency's effort to

support the Warren Commission during the Commission's investi-

gations.

Mr. Moore has stated that he was never asked by Mr.

de Mohrenschildt for advice.concerning Oswald.

We find no

indication that there was ever any contact between Oswald and

Mr. Moore.

Russell of Dial Press, Concerning Dallas Field

Office Association with Lee Harvey Oswald and George delohrenschildt

16-08-93

6-82-71

On the evening of 13 July 1976, at about 2100, Mr. Richard

Russell of the Dial Press and the Dell Publishing Company, came by

my house. He advised that he was working on a book on the Kennedy

assassination and that he understood I was a friend of George

defiohrenschild.

He wanted to know if I had ever met Lee Harvey Oswald

or if dellohrenschildt had ever suggested that I should see Oswald.

I told him no on both counts and advised that I have not seen or

talked with George deliohrenschildt since the fall of 1961.

Mr. Russell attempted to draw me into discussion of the

Kennedy assassination which I avoided and wanted to know if I could

give him the name of the chief of the CIA office in Mexico City in

1963.I told him I could not, and he said he could probably get the

name from bir. David Phillips.

I do not foresee any advarse publicity

as a result of Hir. Russell's visit but felt that it should be made a

matter of record.

if I had talked to George deliohrenschildt about Ice Harvey Oswald. After

I told her that I would not discuss the matter, she said that she under-

stood fxom deMolirenschilde that I had talked to him after he had returned

Subject: .W.L. OLTMANS (10 June 1925)

On 28 December 1971 OLTHING invited the Cultural Attache of

Russian Embassy KUZNETSOV for an

evening in his house. The invit-

ation vas also for some other members of the Russian Representation.

At the same time OLTMANS was to invite some six important journalists

KUZNETSOV should ask OPALEV and IZWEKOV to come along with

The date agreed' on originally was 11 January 1972. It then was

changed twice.. Then 14 January also wasn't suitable, it was agreed

on 7 January to make the date for 18. January 1972 at 20.00 hrs.

From the invitation it could only be infered that OLTMANS wanted

to offer his guests an opportunity for an informal discussion.

About the background of the present good relations of OLTMANS with

the Soviet Representation

The Netherlands, section B is able to

report the following:

(This information comes from vulnerable source - OPPERBAAS.)

1. In September 1970 OLTMANS says with some surprise that he sudden-

ly received an invitation to

a party at the Russian Embassy.

He thinks it crazy; he

doesn't belong to that club at all. But

his thinking is along the lines of those people.

2. In October 1970 OLTHANS appears to be interested in an interview

with KOSYGIN's son-in-law GVISHIANI who allegedly

was connected

with American-Russian discussions about forming a mutual "think-

ing factory":

Presumably this had some connection with the so called Club of

Rome in which GVISHIANI plays a role.

Remark: GVISHIANI is chairman of the

state committee for science

and technology

and is suspected to be a highly placed

Intelligence Officer.

3. Begining March 1970 OLTMANS contacted the Press Attache OPALEV

the Russian Embassy; OLTMANS would

still like to have an

interview with GVISHIANI.

It would be a filmed interview in which OLTMANS would

with the NOS. (TV).

In this period OPALEV's cooperation does not yet seem

extensive.

4. Thanks to the cooperation of Aurelio PECCLI,

chairman of the

Club of Rome, OLTMANS at the end of April 1971 succeeded in get-

ting in contact with GVISHIANI in Paris.

Also present at this discussion was the

former member of the Russi

Embassy FEDEROVSKY, now chief of protocol of the state committee

for science and technology.

2.

At this opportunity GVISHIANI immediately invited OLTNANS fOr a

visit to Moscow.

FEDEROVSKY was instructed to inform the Russian Embassy in The

Hague about it.

GVISHIANI

who at the same time is chairman of the commission for

environment administration in the Soviet Union, asked OLTMANS

make a film

at the same

time

the Soviet Union to support the international environment

conference

to be held this year.

5.

Begining May it becomes clear that since OLTMANS discussion with

GVISHIANI, OPALEV'S

attitude towards OLTMANS has greatly changed.

OPALEV is now all willingness.

In May OLTMANS makes his film with GVISHIANI and receives an inv

itation to come to the Soviet Union for the second half of August

and the whole of September, where he could film ten scientific

institutes.

GVISHIANI told OLTMANS that he had complete trust in him.

6. In June 1971 OLIMANS again contacted GVISHIANI,

this time in

Vienna, where there was a meeting of the Club of Rome.

7. Begining October 1971 OLTMANS again saw

GVISHIANI in Paris, where,

among other things he spoke to him about his visit to The

Netherlan

in the second week of October.

OLTMANS did his best to oblige GVISHIANI while visiting The Neth-

erlands by trying to establish business relations for him (for

instance with Philips).

This offer was made to OLTMANS during his visit to the Soviet

Union. It is concretization of the earlier offer by GVISHIANI to

film a number of scientific institutes in the Soviet Union.

9. On 23 January 1972 OLTMANS will make another visit to Moscow to

discuss making the above mentioned filns without the participation

about LUNS

Secretary-General of NATO.

OLTMANS wants to prevent LUNS getting any future opportunity to

visit Moscow.

3.

In the morning on 18 January OLIMANS also

stated that KUZNETSOV

said that OLIMANS' action against LUNS will not succeed because

the "bosses" stand

behind LUNS.

It is not clear when KUZNDTSOV

said this to OLTANS, but it is

known

that OLTHANS rocently attended a mecting whero a number

of Russians were present.

(Possibly the meeting of the Association "Nederland-USSR" with

the delegation from

"USSR-Nederland" on 14 January 1972.)

On 19 January 1972 it was reported that HOFLAND (one of the guest

invited

to. the evening in

OLTMANS' house) called before his

arrival and asked whether he could bring a friend.

Afterwards this friend appeared to be Petor ZONNIVELD from De

Telegraaf.

OLTMANS

said that at the press conference which he (OLTMANS)

will give on 20 January 1972 several guests, Ni10 ANSTADT,

Rob:!

KOPUIT

and Jaap JANSEN will defend OLTMANS against the attack on

him in "De Telegraal" of this morning.
