Provision of the JFK Act allowed for

certain information to be postponed from public release until the

year 2017; therefore, the pages have NOT necessarily been released

for public review in their entirety.

Under the JFK Act, originals to all material deemed

assassination records must be accessioned to NARA regardless of

whether the material is open in full or released with information

postponed.

Therefore, any documents or pages from FBI files

accessioned to NARA pursuant to the JFK Act are no longer considered

the possession of the FBI. The duplicate pages have been inserted

strictly for research purposes.

The copies contained within the previously mentioned

file(s) do not necessarily show the most up-to-date classification.
