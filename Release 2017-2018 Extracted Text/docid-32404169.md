Declassification of JFK

Assassination Documents

Memorandum from Executive Director, dated

13 April 1993, Same Subject (ER 93-2248)

D0/093-1085

1. Your referenced memorandum has asked that the

Directorate of Operations take steps to speed up the process of

reviewing JEK records.

2.

I had earlier been made aware of the slow pace of the Do

review

(the ratio of HRG to DO officers was 10 to 1) and

I have taken action to alleviate the resulting backlog.

On

12 April, the DO work force reviewing these materials was

increased to the full time equivalent of four persons.

Barring

any unforseen difficulties, we anticipate that our increased

effort will eliminate the

57,000 page backlog before the end of

The DO officers currently involved in this review can then

turn their collective attention to the additional 135,000 pages

to be completed by 22 August 1993.

3.

I am hopeful that the extra resources will turn the

tide.

With this in mind, this Directorate will reexamine the

progress of the workforce by mid-May and decide on the

feasibility of additional help. Because I have detailed these

officers to this project from the FOlA effort, you also need to

be aware that my FOIA response capability has

been severely

strained. A decrease in FOIA case output is inevitable,

resulting in one Congressionally mandated effort being

in

competition with another.

4. I believe that the efforts to protect DO sources and

methods have been entirely justified thus far, particularly our

determination to protect liaison involvement, covert employees'

names, sources' identities and locations of stations worldwide.

I understand considerable concessions have been made already

which depart from the DO's normal withholding criteria, such as

the release of many officers' names and the contents of

intelligence and operational reporting.

5. While the JEK procedures do not set a precedent for

current and future FOIA

cases, I expect the treatment given to

JFK documents will inevitably affect the criteria used in other

release projects/investigations in the future.

We cannot afford

to be imprudent about protecting DO sources and methods in this

or any future circumstance.

6. The DO coordination officers have been reminded of their

responsiblity to be responsive to the letter and the spirit of

the JEK Act.

demonstrating damage to the national security should any

withholding

be challenged.
