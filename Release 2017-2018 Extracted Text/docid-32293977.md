Re New York letter 11/1/71 captioned "SUSAN HEILIGMAN -

FRANK."

Referenced letter indicates that New York has several

sources who logically could be targeted against FRANK.

Chicago

believes they should be utilized to establish a rapport with

the subject which must be done on a continuing personal basis.

Chicago informants based a thousand miles from subject could

not likely obtain information from her of more value to the

Bureau than New York's sources notwithstanding the financial

consideration involved. Clu)

the one ney send ne, tea to travel to

Other business, the prospect of

their cantacting subject will be considered at that time.

CG 1726298 full debriefing is imminent ana any

information

regarding SUE FRANK will be promptly forwarded.
