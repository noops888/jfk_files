GENERAL REMARKS

This man shows complete lack of any

leadership qualifications

and it is extremely

doubtful whether he would develoy any aring

training.

His experience in the French Army

and in France after the fall, as tell as his

French backgrond, should be used in some

capacity and it is suggested, therefore, that he

would be more suited as a suborâinate member of

a coup-de-main party.

On 30 August we went to Besier to contact the local resistance

London to presare to disarm

Inasauch as I had no power

All of these orders I brought Dace to Ioulouse and

turned over to Ravanel.

Several days leter General De Gaulle arrived.

His orders were

that all allied missions would quit Toulouse and return to the UK.

As It Thevenet had gone to Paris on a mission and had never

returned, I left Toulouse with Sgt Carperter.

All Intelligence was passed on to the Britteny Base Section in

We also made cortect with the j4th

Division Headquarters at Chateaubrient here I leerned they had an

escadrille of French planes at Vannes.

I l mediately left for Vannes

and made contact with the lesder of the escadrille whose rission was

to harrass the enemy positions in our sector.

I gave him necessary.

Intelligence on the targets and arranged a means of communications

by panels.

When the plane would arrive over the panels and buzz

twice that neart he would lend at Cognec where he would pick up

the latest intelligence and ask the pilots to bomb.

Twelve of these

missions ted been carried out and were very successful.

As messages to London vere not answered I went to Paris and

contacted SHARF who ordered me to return to the field and bring baok

all the latest intelliience.

In the reentime General Delarinat

took charge of operations on the Westen Front and after sxing

contact with him and otner members of his staff we were told to

leave for Peris as the Jed missione were no longer wanted. I com

pletely understand this because the French Army has not won an 1m-

portant battle In France and it Is necessary for the morale of the

French Arny that the French should lay on an operation completely

French that will be suocessful.

I arrived in Paris on 13 November.
