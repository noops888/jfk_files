mail openings, which it branded as

Cover-Up

The committee is not asking embar-

rassing questions even when answers

are readily available. A couple of

weeks ago, at an open hearing, an

By William Safire

WASHINGON, Nov. 19-On Oct. 10,

1963, the then-Attorney General of the

United States put his personal signa-

ture on a document that launched and

legitimatized one of the most horren-

dous abuses of Federal police power in

this century.

In Senator Frank Church's subcom-

mittee hearing room this week,

the

authorized

wiretapping and

subse-

quent unauthorized bugging and at-

tempted blackmailing of Martin Luther

King Jr. is being gingerly examined,

with the "investigation" conducted in

such a way

as not to unduly

ein-

barrass officials of the Kennedy or

Johnson Administrations.

With great care, the committee has

focused on the F.B.I. Yesterday, when?

the committee counsel first set forth

the result of shuffling through press

clips, it seerned as if no Justice De-d

partment had existed in 1962; today,

an F.B.I. witness pointed out that it

was Robert Kennedy who authorized

the wiretap of Dr. King, and that "the

President of the United States and the

Altorney General specifically discussed

their concern of Communist influence

with Dr. King."

But the Church committee showed

no zest for getting further to the Ken-

nedy root of this precedent to Water-

gate eavesdropping. If Senator Church

were willing to let the chips fall where

they may, he would call some knowl-

edgeable witnesses into the glare of

the camera lights and ask them some

questions that have gone unasked for

• thirteen years.

For example, he could call Nicholas

Katzenbach, Attorney General Ken-

nedy's deputy and successor, and ask

what he knows of the Kennedy de-

cision to wiretap Dr. King. Who at

Justice concurred in the recommenda-

tion? How does the F.B.I. know the 1

President was consulted or informed?

After Mr. Katzenbach assumed of-

fice, and the wiretapping continued,

he was told by angry newsmen that

the F.B.I. was leaking scurrilous in-

formation about Dr. King. Why did he

wait for four months, and for a thou-

sand telephonic intercaptions, to dise

continue the officially approved tap?

Of course, this sort of testimony

would erode Senator Church's political

base, That is why we do not see foi-

iner Assistant F.B.I. director Cartha

(Ocke)

Deloach,

Lyndon

Johnson's

personal contact with the F.B.I. in the

witners chair. What did President

Johnson know about the character-

assascination plot and when did he

know it? What

conversations took

place betwaen Mr. Deioach and Presi-

dent Johnson on the lapping

of Dr.

King, or about the use of the F.B.I. in

miy other intrusions into the lives of

the replacement of

PERTAINING TO THE KU KLUX KLAN,

GARY ROWE, FORMER FBI INFORMANT, AND

PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS OF THE FBI

TO PREVENT VIOLENCE

QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

....You do use informants and do instruct them to

spread dissention among certain groups that they are

informing on, do you not?

We did when we had the COINTEL programs which were

discontinued in 1971, and I think the Klan is probably one

of the best examples of a situation where the law was

ineffective at the time. We heard the term, State's Rights

used much more than we hear today. We saw with the

Little Rock situation the President of the United States

sending in the troops pointing out the necessity to use

local law enforcement. We must have local law enforcement

use the troops only as a last resort. When you have a

situation like this where you do try to preserve the

respective roles in law enforcement, you have historical

problems.

With the Klan coming along, we had situations where

the FBI and the Federal Government was almost powerless

to act. We had local law enforcement officers in some

areas participating in Klan violence. The incidents

mentioned by Mr. Rowe--everyone of those he saw them from the

lowest level--the informant. He didn't see what action

was taken with that information as he pointed out during

his testimony. Our files

show that this information was

reported to the police departments in every instance.

We also know that in certain instances the infor-

mation upon being received was not being acted upon. We

also disseminated simultaneously through letterhead

QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

memorandum to the Department of Justice the problem.

And here we were--the FBI--in a position where we had no

authority in the absence of an instruction from the

Department of Justice to make an arrest. Section 241

and 242 don't cover it because you don't have evidence

of a conspiracy. It ultimately resulted in a situation

where the Department called in U. S. Marshals who do have

authority similar to local law enforcement officials.

So historically, in those days, we were just as

frustrated as anyone else was, that when we got information

from someone like Mr. Rowe--good information, reliable

information--and it was passed on to those who had the

responsibility to do something about it, it was not always

acted upon as he indicated.

In none of these cases, then, there was adequate

evidence of conspiracy to give you jurisdiction to act.

The Departmental rules at that time, and still do,

require Departmental approval where you have a conspiracy.

Under 241, it takes two or more persons acting together.

You can have a mob scene and you can have blacks and whites

belting each other, but unless you can show that those that

initiated the action acted in concert, in a conspiracy, you

have no violation.

Congress recognized this and it wasn't until 1968

that they came along and added Section 245 to the Civil

Rights Statute which added punitive measures against an

QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

individual. There didn't have to be a conspiracy. This

was a problem that the whole country was grappling with--

the President of the United States, Attorneys General--we

were in a situation where we had rank lawlessness taking

place. As you know from the memorandum we sent you that

we sent to the Attorney General the accomplishments we were

able to obtain in preventing violence and in neutralizing

the Klan and that was one of the reasons.

....A local town meeting on a controversial social

issue might result in disruption. It might be by hecklers

rather than by those holding the meeting. Does this

mean that the Bureau should investigate all groups

organizing or participating in such meetings because

they may result in violent government disruption?

No sir, and we don't....

Isn't that how you justify spying on almost every

aspect of the peace movement?

No sir. When we monitor demonstrations, we monitor

demonstrations where we have an indication that the

demonstration itself is sponsored by a group that we have

an investigative interest in, a valid investigative

interest in, or where members of one of these groups are

participating where there is a potential that they might

change the peaceful nature of the demonstration.

This is our closest question of trying to draw

guidelines to avoid getting into an area of infringing

on the lst Amendment right, yet at the same time, being

-3 -

NW 54965 DocId: 32989503 Page 44

---

## Page 45

aware of groups such as we have had in greater numbers

in the past than we do at the present time. We have had

periods where the demonstrations have been rather severe

and the courts have said that the FBI has the right,

and indeed the duty, to keep itself informed with respect

to the possible commission of crime. It is not obliged

to wear blinders until it may be too late for prevention.

Now that's a good statement if applied in a clear-cut

case.

QUESTION:

MR. WANNALI:

MR. ADAMS:

Our problem is where we have a demonstration and

we have to make a judgment call as to whether it is one

that clearly fits the criteria of enabling us to monitor

the activities. That's where I think most of our disagree-

ments fall.

In the Rowe Case, in the Rowe testimony that we just

heard, what was the rationale again for not intervening when

violence was known about. I know we have asked this several

times--I'm still having trouble understanding what the

rationale, Mr. Wannall, was in not intervening in the Rowe

situation when violence was known.

Senator Schweiker, Mr. Adams did address himself to

that and if you have no objections, I'll ask that he be

the one to answer the question.

The problem we had at the time, and it is the problem

today, we are an investigative agency; we do not have

police powers even like the U. S. Marshals do. The Marshals

- 4 -

NW 54965 DocId: 32989503 Page 45

---

## Page 46

since about 1795 I guess, or some period like that, had

authorities that almost border on what a sheriff has. We

are the investigative agency of the Department of Justice,

and during these times the Department of Justice had us

maintain the role of an investigative agency.

We were to report on activities. We furnished the

information to the local police who had an obligation to

act. We furnished it to the Department of Justice in those

areas where the local police did not act. It resulted

finally in the Attorney General sending 500 U. S. Marshals

down to guarantee the safety of people who were trying to

march in protest of their civil rights.

This was an extraordinary measure because it came at

a time of Civil Rights versus Federal Rights and yet there

was a breakdown in law enforcement in certain areas of the

country. This doesn't mean to indict all law enforcement

agencies in the South at the time either, because many of

them did act upon the information that was furnished to

them. But we have no authority to make an arrest on the

spot because we would not have had evidence that was a

conspiracy available. We could do absolutely nothing in

that regard. In Little Rock the decision was made, for

instance, that if any arrests need to be made, the Army

should make them. And next to the Army, the U. S. Marshals

should make them--not the FBI, even though we developed

the violations. We have over the years as you know at the

QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

QUESTION:

MR ADAMS:

Time there were many questions raised. Why doesn't the

FBI stop this? Why don't you do something about it? Well,

we took the other route and effectively destroyed the Klan

as far as committing acts of violence and, of course, we

exceeded statutory guidelines in that area.

What would be wrong, just following up on your point

there, Mr. Adams, with setting up a program since it is

obvious to me that a lot of our informers are going to

have preknowledge of violence of using U. S. Marshals on

some kind of long-range basis to prevent violence?

We do. We have them in Boston in connection with

the busing incident. We are investigating the violations

under the Civil Rights Act, but the Marshals are in

Boston. They are in Louisville, I believe, at the same

time and this is the approach that the Federal Government

finally recognized.

On an immediate and fairly contemporary basis that

kind of help can be sought instantly as opposed to waiting

till it gets to a Boston state. I realize a departure from

the past and not saying it isn't, but it seems to me we need

a better remedy than we have.

Well, fortunately we are at a time where conditions have

subsided in the country even from the 60's and the 70's, or

50's and 60's.

We report to the Department of Justice on

potential trouble spots around the country as we learn of them

so that the Department will be aware of them. The planning

## Page 48

QUESTION:

for Boston, for instance, took place a year in advance, with

state officials, city officials, the Department of Justice

and the FBI sitting down together saying "How are we going to

protect the situation in Boston"? I think we have learned a

lot from the days back in the early 60's. But, the Government

had no mechanics which protected people at that time.

Next I would like to ask, back in 1965, I guess during

the height of the effort to destroy the Klans as you put it

a few moments ago, I believe the FBI has released figures that

we had something like 2,000 informers of some kind or another

infiltrating the Klan out of roughly 10,000 estimated member-

ship.

MR. ADAMS:

QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

That's right.

I believe these are FBI figures or estimates. That would

mean that 1 out of every 5 members of the Klan at that point

was an informant paid by the Government and I believe the

figure goes on to indicate that 70 percent of the new members

in the Klan that year were FBI informants. Isn't that an

awful overwhelming quantity of people to put in an effort such

as that? I'm not criticizing that we shouldn't have informants

in the Klan and know what is going on to revert violence but it

just seems to me that the tail is sort of wagging the dog. For

example today we supposedly have only 1594 total informants,

both domestic informants and potential informants. Yet, here

we have 2,000 in just the Klan alone.

Well, this number of 2,000 did include all racial matters

and informants at that particular time and I think the figures

## Page 49

QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

we tried to reconstruct as to the actual number of Klan

informants in relaton to Klan members was around 6 percent, I

think after we had read some of the testimony on it. Isn't that

right, Bill? Now the problem we had on the Klan is the Klan

had a group called the Action Group. This was the group if you

remember from Mr. Rowe's testimony that he was left out of in

the beginning. He attended the open meetings and heard all the

hoorahs and this type of information but he never knew what was

going on because each one had an Action Group that went out and

considered themselves in the missionary field. Theirs was the

violence. In order to penetrate those you have to direct as

many informants as you possibly can against it. Bear in mind

that I think the newspapers, the President, Congress, everyone,

was concerned about the murder of the three civil rights

workers, the Lemul Penn case, the Violet Liuzzo case, the

bombings of the church in Birmingham. We were faced with one

tremendous problem at that time.

I acknowledge that.

Our only approach was through informants. Through the

use of informants we solved these cases. The ones that were

solved. There were some of the bombing cases we never solved.

They're extremely difficult, but, these informants as we told

the Attorney General and as we told the President, we moved

informants like Mr. Rowe up to the top leadership. He was the

bodyguard to the head man. He was in a position where he

could see that this could continue forever unless we could

## Page 50

QUESTION:

MR ADAMS:

QUESTION:

create enough disruption that these members will realize that

if I go out and murder three civil rights, even though the

Sheriff and other law enforcement officers are in on it, if

that were the case, and in some of that was the case, that I

will be caught, and that's what we did, and that's why violence

stopped because the Klan was insecure and just like you say

20 percent, they thought 50 percent of their members ultimately

were Klan members, and they didn't dare engage in these acts of

violence because they knew they couldn't control the conspiracy

any longer.

I just have one quick question. Is it correct that in

1971 we were using around 6500 informers for a black ghetto

situation?

I'm not sure if that's the year. We did have a year

where we had a number like that of around 6000 and that was

the time when the cities were being burned. Detroit, Washington,

areas like this, we were given a mandate to know what the

situation is, where is violence going to break out next. They

weren't informants like an individual that is penetrating an

organization. They were listening posts in the community that

would help tell us that we have another group here that is

getting ready to start another fire fight or something.

... Without going into that subject further of course we

have had considerable evidence this morning where no attempt

was made to prevent crime when you had information that it

was going to occur. I am sure there were instances where

you have.

MR. ADAMS:

QUESTION:

We disseminated every single item which he reported to us.

To a police department which you knew was an accomplice to

the crime.

Not necessarily knew.

Your informant told you that, hadn't he?

The informant is on one level. We have other informants

and we have other information.

You were aware that he had worked with certain members

of

the Birmingham Police in order...

That's right. He furnished many other instances also.

So you really weren't doing a whole lot to prevent that

incident by telling the people who were already a part of it.

We were doing everything we could lawfully do at the

time and finally the situation was corrected when the Department

agreeing that we had no further jurisdiction, sent the U.s.

Marshals down to perform certain law enforcement functions.

.. This brings up the point as to what kind of control

you can exercise over this kind of informant and to this

kind of organization and to what extent an effort is made to

prevent these informants from engaging in the kind of thing

that you were supposedly trying to prevent.

A good example of this was Mr. Rowe who became active in

an Action Group and we told him to get out or we were no longer

using him as an informant in spite of the information he had

furnished in the past. We have cases, Senator where we have had

QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

QUESTION:

We did not tell him to participate in violent activities.

That's what he said.

I know that's what he says, but that's what lawsuits

are all about is that there are two sides to issues and our

Agent handlers have advised us, and I believe have advised your

staff members, that at no time did they advise him to engage

in violence.

Just to do what was necessary to get the information.

I do not think they made any such statement to him

along that line either and we have informants who have gotten

involved in the violation of a law and we have immediately

converted their status from an informant to the subject and

have prosecuted I would say off hand, I can think of around

20 informants that we have prosecuted for violating the laws

once it came to our attention and even to show you our policy

of disseminating information on violence in this case during

the review of the matter the Agents have told me that they

found one case where an Agent had been working 24 hours a

day and he was a little late in disseminating the information

to the police department. No violence occurred but it showed

up in a file review and he was censured for his delay in

properly notifying local authorities. So we not only

have a policy, I feel that we do follow reasonable safeguards

in order to carry it out, including periodic review of all

informant files.

Mr. Rowe's statement is substantiated to some extent with

an acknowledgment by the Agent in Charge that if he were going

MR. ADAMS:

to be a Klansman and he happened to be with someone and they

decided to do something, he couldn't be an angel. These are

words of the Agent. And be a good informant. He wouldn't

take the lead but the implication is that he would have

to go along or would have to be involved if he was going

to maintain his liability as a ---

There is no question that an informant at times will

have to be present during demonstrations, riots, fistfights

that take place but I believe his statement was to the

effect that, and I was sitting in the back of the room and I do

not recall it exactly, but that some of them were beat with

chains and I did not hear whether he said he beat someone with

a chain or not but I rather doubt that he did, because it is

one thing being present, it is another thing taking an

active part in a criminal action.

It's true. He was close enought to get his throat cut

apparently.

How does the collection of information about an

individual's personal life, social, sex life and becoming

involved in that sex life or social life is a requirement for

law enforcement or crime prevention.

Our Agent handlers have advised us on Mr. Rowe that

they gave him no such instruction, they had no such knowledge

concerning it and I can't see where it would be of any

value whatsoever.

Senator Tower.

What criteria do you use in the selection

of informants?

Mr. Wannall. Well, the criteria vary with the needs. In

our cases relating to extremist matters, surely in, order to get

an informant who can meld into a group which is engaged in a

criminal type activity, you're going to have a different set

of criteria. If you're talking about our internal security

matters, I think we set rather high standards. We do require

that a preliminary inquiry be conducted which would consist

principally of checks of our headquarters indices, our field

office indices, checks with other informants who are operating

in the same area, and in various established sources such as

local police departments.

Following this, if it appears that the person is the type

who has credibility, can be depended upon to be reliable, we

would interview the individual in order to make a determination

as to whether of not he will be willing to assist the FBI

in discharging its responsibilities in that. field.

Following that, assuming that the. answer is positive, we

would conduct a rather in depth investigation for the purpose

of. further attempting to establish credibility and reliability.

Senator. Tower. How. does the. Bureau. distinguish between

the use of informants for law enforcement as opposed to

intelligence. collection?

Is the guidance different, or is it the same, or what?

Mr. Wannall. Well, Mr. Adams can probably best address

the use of informants on criminal matters since he is over

the operational division on that.

MI. Adams. You do have somewhat of a difference in the fact

that a criminal informant in a law enforcement function, you

are trying to develop evidence which will be admissible in

court for prosecution, whereas with intelligence, the informant

alone, your purpose could either be prosecution or it could be

just for purposes of pure intelligence.

The difficulty in both is retaining the confidentiality

of the individual and protecting the individual, and trying to,

through use of the informant, obtain evidence which could be

used independently of the testimony of the informant so that

he can continue operating as a criminal informant.

Senator Tower. Are these informants ever authorized to

function as provocateurs?

Mr. Adams. No, sir, they're not. We have strict regula-

tions against using informants as provocateurs. This gets

into that delicate area

of entrapment which has been addressed

by the courts on many occasions and has been concluded by the

courts that providing an individual has a willingness to engage

in an activity, the government has the right to provide him the

opportunity. This does not mean, of course, that mistakes don't

occur in this area, but we take whatever steps we can to

avoid this. Even the law has recognized that informants can

engage in criminal activity, and the courts have held that,

especially the Supreme Court in the Newark County Case, that•

the very difficulty of penetrating an ongoing operation, that

an informant himself can engage in criminal activity, but

because there is lacking this criminal intent to violate a

law, we stay away from that. Our regulations fall short of that.

If we have a situation where we felt that an informant

has to become involved in some activity in order to protect

or conceal his use as an informant, we go right to the United

States Attorney or to the Attorney General to try to make sure

we are not stepping out of bounds insofar as the use of our

informants.

Senator Tower. But you do use these informants and do

instruct them to spread dissension among certain groups that

they are informing on, do you not?

Mr. Adams. We did when we had the COINTELPRO program$,

which were discontinued in 1971, and I think the Klan is probably

one of the best examples of a situation where the law was

in effect at the time. We heard the term States Rights used

much more then than we hear it today. We saw in the Little

Rock situation the President of the United States, in sending

in the troops, pointing out the necessity to use local law

enforcement. We must have local law enforcement, to use the

troops only as a last resort.

And then you have a situation like this where you do try

to preserve the respective roles in law enforcement. You have

historical problems with the Klan coming along. We had

situations where the FBI and the Federal Government was almost

powerless to act.

We had local law enforcement officers in

some areas participating in Klan violence.

The instances mentioned by Mr. Rowe, every one of those,

he saw them from the lowest level of the informant. He didn't

see what action was taken with that information, as he pointed

out in his testimony. Our files show that this information was

reported to the police departments in every instance. We

also knew that in certain instances the information, upon being

received, was not being acted upon. We also disseminated

simultaneously through letterhead memoranda to the Department

of Justice the problem, and here, here we were, the FBI, in a

position where we had no authority in the absence of instruction

from the Department of Justice, to make an arrest.

Sections 241 and 242 don't cover it because you don't have

evidence of a conspiracy, and it ultimately resulted in

a situation where the Department called in United States

Marshals who do have authority similar to local law enforcement

officials.

23

So, historically, in those days, we were just as frus-

trated as anyone else was, and when we got information from

24

25

someone like Mr. Rowe, good information, reliable information,

and it was passed on to those who had the responsibility to

Mi: Adams. The Departmental rules at that time, and still

require Departmental approval where you have a conspiracy.

Under 241, it takes two or more persons acting together. You

can have a mob scene, and you can have blacks and whites

belting each other, but unless you can show that those that

initiated the action acted in concert in a conspiracy, you have.

no violation.

Congress recognized this, and it wasn't until 1968

that they came along and added Section 245 to the civil rights

statute, which added punitive

measures against an individual

that didn't have to be a conspiracy. But this was a problem

that the whole country was grappling with: the President of

the United States, Attorney General. We were in a situation

where we had rank lawlessness taking place, as you know from

a memorandum we sent you that we sent to the Attorney General.

The accomplishments we were able to obtain in preventing

violence, and in neutralizing the Klan - and that was one

of the reasons.

Veterans Against the War?

Was there a legitimate law enforcement purpose, or was the

intent to halter political expression?

Mr. Adams. We had information on the Vietnam Veterans

Against the War that indicated that there were subversive

groups involved. They were going to North Vietnam and meeting

with the Communist forces.

They were going to Paris, attending

meetings paid for and sponsored by the Communist Party, the

International Comnunist Party. We feel that we had a very valid

basis to direct our attention to the VAW.

It started out, of course, with Gus Hall in 1967, who was

head of the Communist Party, USA, and the comments he made,

and what it finally boiled down to was a situation where it

split off into the Revolutionary Union, which was a Maost

group, and the hard-line Communist group, and at that point

factionalism developed in many of the chapters, and they closed

those chapters because there was no longer any intent to follow

the national organization.

But we had a valid basis for investigating it, and we

investigated chapters to determine if there was affiliation

and subservience to the national office.

Senator Tower. Mr. Mart?

Senator Hart of Michigan. But in the process of chasing

after the Veterans Against the War, you got a lot of information

that clearly has no rclationship to any Federal criminal

statute.

Mr. Adams. I agree, Senator.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Why don't you try to shut that

stuff off by simply telling the agent, or your informant?

Mr. Adams. Here is the problem that you have with that.

When you're looking at an organization, do you report only the

violent statements made by the group or do you also show that

you may have one or two violent individuals, but you have

some of these church groups that were mentioned, and others,

that the whole intent of the group is not in violation of the

statutes. You have to report the good, the favorable along

with the unfavorable, and this is a problem. We wind up with

information in our files. We are accused of being vacuum

cleaners, and you are a vacuum cleaner. If you want to know the

real purpose of an organization, do you only report the

violent statements made and the fact that it is by. a small

minority, or do you also show the broad base of the organization

and what it really is?

And within that is where we have to have the guidelines

we have talked about before. We have to narrow down, because

we recognize that we do wind up with too much information in

our files.

• Senator Hart of Michigan. But in that vacuuming process:

you are feeding into Departmental files the names of people

who are, who have been engaged in basic First Amendment

Mr. Adams. It hangs me up. But in the same files I

imagine every one of you has been interviewed by the FBI, eithex

asking you about the qualifications of some other Senator

being considered for a Presidential appointment, being inter-

viewed concerning some friend who is applying for a job.

Now, someone can say, as reported at our last session, that

this is an indication, the mere fact that we have a name in our

files has an onerous impression, a chilling effect. I agree.

It can have, if someone wants to distort what we have in our

States, and that isn't distorted ox improperly used, I don't

• Senator Hart of Michigan. This is what should require

us to rethink this whole business.

Mr. Adams. Absolutely.

And this is what I hope the guidelines committees as well

as the Congressional input are going to address themselves to.

Senator Hart of Michigan. We've talked about a wide range

of groups which the Bureau can and has had informant penetration

and report on. Your manual, the Bureau manual's definition

of when an extremist or security investigation may be under-

taken refers to groups whose activity either involves violation

of certain specified laws, or which may result in the violation

of such law, and when such an investigation is opened, then

informants may be used.

Another guideline says that domestic intelligence

investigations now must be predicated on criminal violations.

The agent need only cite a statute suggesting an investigation

relevant to a potential violation. Even now, with an improved,

upgraded effort to avoid some of these problems, we are back

again in a world of possible violations or activities which

may result in illegal acts.

Now, any constitutionally protected exercise of the

right to demonstrate, to assemble, to protest, to petition,

conceivably may result in violonce or disruption of a local

town meeting, when a controversial social issue might result

in disruption. It might be by hecklers rather than those holding

the meeting.

Does this mean that the Bureau should investigate all

groups organizing or participating in such a meeting because

they may result in violence, disruption?

MI. Adams. No, sir.

Senator llart of Michigan.

Isn't that how you justify

spying on almost every aspect of the peace movement?

Mr. Adams. No, sir. When we monitor demonstrations, we •

monitor demonstrations where we have an indication that the

demonstration itself is sponsored by a group that we have an

investigative interest in, a valid investigative interest in,

or where members of one of these groups are participating where

there is a potential that they might change the peaceful

nature of the demonstration.

But this is our closest question of trying to draw

guidelines to avoid getting into an area of infringing on the

First Amendment rights of people, yet at the same time being

aware of groups such as we have had in greater numbers in the

past than we do at the present time. But we have had periods

where the demonstrations have been rather severe, and the

courts have said that the FBI has a right, and indeed a duty,

to keep itself informed with respect to the possible commission

of crime. It is not obliged to wear blinders until it may be

too late for prevention.

And that's a good statement if applied in a clearcut

case. Our problem is where we have a demonstration and we have

to make a judgment call as to whether it is one that clearly

fits the criteria

of enabling us to monitor the activities, and

that's where I think most of our disagreements fall:

Sonator lart of lichigan. Let's assume that the rule

for opening an investigation on a group is narrowly drawn. The

Bureau manual states that informants investigating a subversive

organization should not only report on what that group is

doing but should look at and report on activities in which

the group is participating.

There is a Section 87B3 dealing with reporting on

connections with other groups. That section says that the

field office shall "determine and report on any significant

connection or cooperation with non-subversive groups." Any

significant connection or cooperation with non-subversive

groups.

Now let's look at this in practice. In the spring of

1969 there was a rather heated national debate over the

installation of the anti-ballistic missile system. Some of us

remember that. An FBI informant and two FBI confidential

sources reported on the plan's participants and activities

of the Washington Area Citizens Coalition Against the ABM,

particularly in open public debate in a high school auditorium,

which included speakers from the Defense Department for the

ABM and a scientist and defense analyst against the ABM.

The informants reportou on the planning for the meeting,

the distribution of materials to churches and schools, ..

participation by local clergy, plans to seek resolution on i.

ABM from nearby town councils. There was also informat:.

plans for a subsequent town meeting in Washington with the

names of local political leaders who would attend.

Now the information, the informant information came

as

part of an investigation of an allegedly subversive group

participating in that coalition. Yet the infornation dealt

with all aspects and all participants. The reports on the

plans for the meeting and on the meeting itself were disseminated

to the State Department, to military intelligence, and to the

White House.

How do we get into all of that?

Mr. Adams.

Well -

Senator Mart of Michigan.

Or if you were to rerun it,

would you do it again?

Mr. Adans.

Well, not in 1975, compared to what 1969

was.

The problem we had at the time was where we had an

informant who had reported that this group, this meeting was

going to take place and it was going to be the Daily world,

which was the east coast communist newspaper that made conments

about it. They formed an organizational meeting. We took

a quick look at it. The case apparently was opened in May 28,

1969 and closed June 5 saying there was no problem with this

organization.

Now the problem we get into is if we take a quick look

and get .out, fine. We've had cases, though, where we have

stayed in too long. When you're dealing with security : i

Soviet espionage where they can put one person in this country

and they supported him with total resources of the Soviet

Union, false identification, all the money he needs, comnuni-

cations networks, satellite assistance, and everything, and

you're working with a paucity of information.

The same problem exists to a certain extent in domestic

security. You don't have a lot of black and white situations.

So someone reports something to you which you feel, you take

a quick look at and there's nothing to it, and I think that's

what they did.

Senator Hart of Michigan. You said that was '69. Let

me bring you up to date, closer to current, a current place

on the calendar.

This one is the fall of last year, 1975. President

Ford announced his new program with respect to amnesty, as

he described it, for draft resistors. Following that there .

were several national conferences involving all the groups

and individuals interested in unconditional amnesty.

Now parenthetically, while unconditional amnesty is

not against - while unconditional amnesty is not yet the law,

we afreed that advocating it is not against the law either.

plans for the meeting and apparently attended and reported on

the conference.

The Bureau's own reports described the

participants as having represented diverse perspectives on

the issue of amnesty, including civil liberties and human

rights groups, G.I. rights spokesmen, parents of men killed

in Vietnam, wives of ex-patriates in Canada, experts on draft

counselling, religious groups interested in peace issues,

delegates from student organizations, and aides of llouse and

Senate members, drafting legislation on amnesty.

The informant apparently was attending in his role as

a member of a

group under investigation as allegedly subversive

and it described the topics of the workshop.

Ironically, the Bureau office report before them noted

that in view of the location of the conference at a theological

seminary, the FBI would use restraint and limit its coverage..

to informant reports.

Now this isn't five or ten years ago. This is last

fall. And this is a conference of people who have the point

of view that I share, that the sooner we have unconditional

amnesty, the better for the soul of the country.

22

Now what reason is it for a vacuum cleaner approach on

a thing like that? Don't these instances illustrate how broad

Is this what we want?

Mr. Adams. I'll let Mr. Wannall address himself to this.

He is particular knowledgeable as to this operation.

Mr. Wannall. Senator llart, that was a case that was

opened on November 14 and closed November 20, and the information

which caused us to be interested in it vere really two particular

items.

One was that a member of the steering committee there,

was a three man steering committee, and oné of those members

of the national conference was in fact a national officer

of the VVAN in whom we had suggested before we did. have a

legitimate investigative interest.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Well, I would almost say so whit

at that point.

Mi. Mannall. The

second report we had was that the

VAW would actively participate in an attempt to pack the

conference to take it over. And the third report we had -

Senator. Hart of Michigan. And incidentally, all of the

information that your Buffalo informant had given you with

respect to the goals and aims of the VAW gave you a list of

goals which were completely within Constitutionally protected

objectives. There wasn't a single item out of that VAl that

jeopardizes the security of this country at all.

Mr. Wannall. Well, of course, ve did not rely entirely

on the Buffalo informant, but even there we did

The Buffalo chapter of the VVAW was the regional office

five nost active VAY chapters in the country and at a

national conference, or at the regional conference, this

informant reported information back to us that an attendee

at the conference announced that he had run guns into Cuba

prior to the Castro take-over. He himself said that he during

the Cuban crisis had been under 24 hour suveillance. There

was also discussion at the conference of subjugating the

VVAW to the revolutionary union. There were some individuals

in the chapter or the regional conference who were not in

agreenent with us, but Mr. Adams has addressed himself to the

interest of the revolutionary union.

So all of the information that we had on the VAW dia

not come from that source but even that particular source did

give us information which we considered to be of some

significance in our appraisal of the need for continuing the

investigation of that particular chapter of the VAw.

Senator Mart of Michigan.

But does it give you the

right or does it create the need to go to a conference, even

if it is a conference that night be taken over by the VAW

when the subject matter is how and by what means shall we

seek to achieve unconditional amnesty? What threat?

Mr. Hannall. Our interest, of course, was the VAW

influence on a particular meeting, if you ever happened to be

holding a meeting, or whatever subject it was.

Senator llart of Michigan. What if it was a meeting to

• seek to make more

effective the food stamp system in this

country?

Mr. Wannall. Well, of course there had been some

organizations.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Would the same logic follow?

Mr. Wannail. I think that if we found that if the

Communist Party USA was going to take over the meeting and

use it as

a front for its own purposes, there would. be a logic

in doing that. You have a whole scope hore and it's a matter

of where you do and where you don't, and hopefully, as wo've

said before, we will have some

guidance, not only from this

committee but from the quidelines that are being developed.

But within the rationale of what we're doing today, I was

explaining to you our interest not in going to this thing and

not gathering everything there was about it.

In fact, only one individual attended and Icported to us,

and that was the person who had, who was not developed for

this reason; an informant who had been reporting on other

matters for some period of time.

And as soon as we got the report of the outroie s

meeting and the fact that in the period of some . ?::

discontinued any further interest.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Heli, my time has expired

but even this brief exchange, I think, indicates that if we

really want to control the dangers to our society of using

informants to gather domestic political intelligence, we have

restrict sharply domestic intelligence investigations. And:

that gets us into what I would like to raise with you when

my turn comes around again, and that's the use of warrants,

obliging the Bureau to obtain a warrant before a full-fledged

informant can be directed by the Bureau against a group of

individuals.

I know you have objections to that and I would like to

review that with you.

Senator Mondale, Pursue that question.

Senator Hart of Michigan. I am talking now about an

obligation so obtain a warrant before you turn floose a full-

fledged informant. I'm not talking about tipsters that run

into you or you run into, or who walk in as information sources

The Bureau has raised some objections in this memorandum to the

Committee. The Bureau argues that such a warrant requirement

might be unconstitutional because it would violate the First

Amendment rights of FBI informants to communicate with their

government.

Now that's a concern for First Amendment rights that

ought to

• hearten all the civil libertarians.

But why would that vary, why would a warrant requirement

2

raise a serious constitutional question?

4

Mr. Adams: Well,

for one thing it's the practicability

of it or the impacticability of'getting a warrant which:

5

ordinarily involves probable cause to show that a crime has

6

7

8

been or is about to be committed.

In the intelligence field ie are not dealing necessarily

with an imminent criminal action. We're dealing with activities

9

such as with the Socialist Workers Party, which we have

10

discussed before, where they say publicly we're not to engage

I] in any violent activity today, but we guarantee you we still

12

subscribe to the tenets of communism and that when the time

13

is ripe, we're going to rise up and help overthrow the United

14

States.

15

16

17

Well, now, you can't show probable cause if they're about

to do it because they're telling you they're not going to do it

and you know they're not going to do it at this particular

18

moment.

19

It's just the mixture somewhat of trying to mix in a

20

criminal procedure with an intelligence gathering function, and

21

we can't find any practical way of doing it. We have a particular

22

organization. We may have an informant that not only belongs

23

24

to the Communist Party, but belongs to several other organization:

and as part of his function he may be sent out by the Communist

25

Party to try to infiltrate one of these clean organizations.

We don't have probable cause for him to target against

that organization, but yet we should be able to receive informa-

tion from him that he as a Communist Party member, even

though in an informant status, is going to that organization

and don't worry about it. We're making no headway on it.

It's just from our standpoint the possibility of informants,

the Supreme Court has held that informants per se do not

violate the First, Fourth, or Fifth Amendments. They have

recognized the necessity that the government has to have

individuals who will assist them in carrying out their

governmental duties.

Senator llart of

Michigan. I'm not sure I've heard anything

yet in response to the constitutional question, the very

practical question that you addressed.

Quickly, you are right that the court has said that the

use of the informant per se is not a violation of constitutional

rights of the subject under investigation. But Congress

can prescribe some safeguards,

some rules and some standards,

just as we have with respect to your use of electronic

surveillance, and could do it with respect to informants.

That's quite different from saying that the warrant

procedure itself would be unconstitutional.

But with respect to the fact that you couldn't show

probable cause, and therefore; you couldn't get a warrant,

therefore you oppose the proposal to require you to get a

warrant. It seems to beg the question.

Assuming that you say that since we use informants and

investigate groups which may only engage in lawful activities

but which might engage in activities that can result in

violence or illegal acts, and you can't use the warrant, but

Congress could say that the use of informants is subject to

such abuse and poses such a threat to legitimate activity,

including the willingness of people to assemble and discuss

the anti-ballistic missilé system, and we don't want you to

use them unless you have indication of criminal activity or

unless you present your request to a magistrate. in the same.

fashion as you are required to do with respect to, in most

cases, to wiretap.

This is an option available to Congress:

Senator Tower. Senator Schweiker.

Senator Schweiker. Thank you very much.

Mr. Wannall, what's the difference between a potential

security informant and a security informant?

Mx. Wannall. I mentioned earlier, Senator Schweiker,

that in developing an informant we do a preliminary check on

him before talking with him and then we do a further in-depth

background check.

A potential security informant is someone who is under

consideration before he is approved by headquarters for use as

an informant. He is someone who is under current consideration.

On some occasions that person will have been developed to a

point where he is in fact furnishing information and we are

engaged in checking upon his reliability.

In some instances he may be paid for information furnished,

but it has not gotten to the point yet where we have satisfied

ourselves that he meets all of our criteria. When he does,.

the field must submit its recommendations to headguarters, and

headquarters will pass upon whether that individual is an

approved FBI informant.

Senator Schweiker.

So it's really the first step of

being an informant, I guess.

Mr. Wannall.. It is a preliminary step, one of the

preliminary steps.

Senator Schweiker. In the Rowe case, in the Rowe

testimony that we just heard, what was the rationale again

for not intervening when violence was known?

I know we asked you several times but I'm still having

trouble understanding what the rationale, Mc. Wannall, was

in not intervening in the Rove situation when violence was

known.

Mr. Wannall. Senator Schiveiker, Mr. Adams did address

himself to that. If you have no objection, I'll ask him to

answer that.

Senator Schweiker. All. right.

Mr. Adams. The problem we had at the time, and it's the

problem today, we are an investigative agency. We do not

have police powers like the United States marshalls do.

About 1795, I guess, or some period like that, marshalls have

had the authority that almost borders on what a sheriff. has.

We are the investigative agency of the Department of Justice

and during these times the Department of Justice had us maintain

the role of an investigative agency. We were to report on

activities to furnish the information to the local police,

who had an obligation to act. We furnished it to the Department

of Justice.

In those areas where the local police did not act, it

resulted finally in the Attorney General sending 500 United

States marshalls down to guarantee the safety of people who

were trying to march in protest

of their civil rights.

This was an extraordinary measure because it came at a

time of civil righs versus

federal rights, and yet there was

a breakdown in law enforcement in certain areas of the country.

This doesn't mean to indict all law enforcement agencies

in itself at the time either because many of them did act

upon the information that was furnished to them. But we

have no authority to make an arrest on the spot because we

would not have had evidence that there was

a.conspiracy

available. We can do absolutely nothing in that regard.

In Little Rock, the decision was made, fox instance, that

if any arrests need to be made, the Army should make them and

next to the Army, the United States marshalls should make them,

not the FBI,

even though we developed the violations.

And over the years, as you know, at the time there were many

questions raised. Why doesn't the FBI stop this? Why don't

you do something about it?

Well, we took the other route and effectively destroyed

the Klan as far as committing acts of violence, and of course

we exceeded statutory guidelines in that area.

Senator Schweiker. What would be wrong, just following

up your point there, Mir. Adams, with setting up a program

sincé it's obvious to me that a lot of informers are going to

have pre-knowledge of violence of using U.S. marshalls on some

kind of a long-range basis to prevent violence?

Mr. Adams. We do. We have them in Boston in connection

with the busing incident. We are investigating the violations

under the Civil Rights Act. But the marshalls are in Boston,

they are in Louisville, I believe at the same time, and this

is the approach, that the federal government finally recognized,

was the solution to the problem where you had to have added

Federal import.

confrontation, shouldn't we have som

help can be sought instantly as opposed to waiting until it

I realize it's a departture from the past. I'm not

saying it isn't. But it seems. to me we need a better remedy

than we have.

MI. Adams.

well, fortunately, we're at a time where

conditions have subsided in the country, even from the '60s

and the '70s and periods -- or '50s and '60s. We report to the

Departient of Justice on potential troublespots around the

country as we learn of them

so that the Department will be

aware of them. The planning for Boston, for instance, took

place a year in advance with state officials, city officials,

the Department of Justice and the FBI sitting down together

saying, how are we going to protect the situation in Boston?

I think we've learned a lot from the days back in the

early '60s. But the government had no mechanics which protected

people at that time.

Senator Schweiker. I'd like to go, if I may, to the

Robert Hardy case. I know he is not a witness but he

was a witness before the llouse. But since this affects my

state, I'd like to ask Mr. Wannall. Mr. Hardy, of course, was

the FBI informer who ultimately led and planned and organized

a raid on the Camden draft board. An' according to Mr. Hardy's

testimony before our Committee, he s..: that in advance of the

raid someone in the Department had even acknowledyed the fact

that they had all the information they needed to clamp down

on the conspiracy and could arrest people at that point in time,

and yet no arrests were made.

Why, Mr. Wannall, was this true?

Mr. Wannall. Well, I can answer that based only on the

material that I have reviewed, Senator Schweiker. It was not

a case handled in my division but I think I can answer your

question.

There was, in fact, a representative of the Department

of Justice on the spot counselling and advising continuously

as that case progressed as to what point the arrest should be

made and we were being guided by those to our mentors, the

ones who are responsible for making decisions of that sort..

So I think that Mr. Hardy's statement to the effect that

there was someone in the Department there is perfectly true.

Senator Schweiker. That responsibility rests with who

under your procedures?

Mr. Wannall. We investigate decisions on making arrests,

when they should be made, and decisions with regard to

prosecutions are made either by the United States attorneys

or by Federals in the Department.

MI. Adams. At this time that particular case did have

someone in the commission of the crime as further proof,

rather than relying on one informant and some circumstantial

evidence to prove the violation.

Senator Schweiker. Well, in this case, though, they

even had a dry run. They could have arrested them on the

dry run.

That's getting pretty close to conspiracy, it seems to

me. They had a dry run and they could have arrested them on

the dry run.

I'd like to know why they didn't arrest them on the dry

run. Who was this Department of Justice official who made

that decision?

Mx. Adams. Guy Goodwin was the Department official.

Senator Schweiker. Next I'd like to ask back in 1965,

during the height of the effort to destroy the klan, as you

put it a few moments ago, I believe the FBI has released

figures that we had something like 2,000 informers of some

kind or another infiltrating the Klan out of roughly 10, 000

estimated membership.

I believe these are either FBI figures or estimates.

That would mean that one out of every five members of the klan

at that point was an informant paid by the government.

And I believe the figure goes or

mo indicate that 70

percent of the new members of the Kla:. that year were FBI

informants.

Isn't this an awfully overwhelming quantity of people.

'to put in an effort such as that? I'm not criticizing that

you shouldn't have informants in

the klan and know what's

going on for violence, but it seems to me that this is the

tail wagging the dog.

For example, today we supposedly have only 1594 total:

informants for both donestic informants and potential informants

and that here we had 2,000 just in the klan alone.

Mr. Adams. Well, this number 2,000 did include all

racial matters, informants at that particular time, and I

think the figures we tried to reconstruct as to the actual

number of Klan informants in relation to Klan members was around

6 percent, I think, after we had read

some of the testimony.

Now the problem we had on the Klan is the Klan had a

group called the Action Group. This was the group that you

remember from Mr. Rowe's testimony, that he was left af-

ter the meeting.

He attended the open meetings

and heard

all of the hurrahs and this type of thing from information,

but he never knew what was going on because each one had an

action group that went out and considered themselves in the

missionary field.

Theirs was the violence.

In order to penetrate those, it takes, you have to direct

as many informants as you possibly can against it. Bear in

mind that I think the newspapers, the President and Congress and

everyone is concerned about the murder of the civil rights

workers, the Linio Kent ease, the Viola Liuzzo case, the

bombings of the church in Birmingham. We were faced with one

tremendous problem at that time.

Senator Schweiker.

I acknowledge that.

Mr. Adams.

Our only approach was through informants

and through the use of informants we solved these cases, the

ones that were solved. Some of the bombing cases we have

never solved. They are extremely difficult.

These informants, as we told the Attorney General, and

as we told the President, that we had moved informants like

Mr. Rowe up to the top leadership. He was the bodyguard to the

head man. He was in a position where he could forewarn us

of violence, could help us on cases that had transpired, and

yet we knew and conceived that this could continue forever

unless we can create enough disruption that these members will

realize that if I go out and murder three civil rights workers,

even though the sheriff and other law enforcement officers are

in on it, if that were

the case and with some of them it was

the case, that I would be caught. And that's what we did and

that's why violence stopped, was because the Klan was insecure

and just like you say, 20

percent, they thought 50 percent of

their members ultimately were Klan members and they didn't

dare engage in these acts of violence because they knew they

25

couldn't control the conspiracy any longer.

Senator Schweiker.

My time is expired. I just have

one quick question..

Is it correct that in 1971 we're using around 6500

informers for black ghetto situations?

Mr. Adams. I'm not sure if that's the year.

We did

have one year where we had a number like that which probably

had been around 6000, and that was the time when the cities

were being burned, Detroit,

Washington, areas like this. We

were given a mandate to know what the situation is, where is

violence going to break out, what next?

They weren't informants like an individual penctrating

an organization. They were listening posts in the community

that would help tell us that we have a group here that's getting

ready to start another fire-fight or something.

Senator Tower. At this point, there are three more

Senators remaining for questioning. If we can try to get

everything in in the first round, we will not have a second

round and I think we can finish around 1:00, and we can. go

on and terminate the proceedings. '

However, If anyone feels that they have another question

that they want to return to, we can come back here by 2:00.

Senator Mondale?

Senator Mondale. MI. Adams, it seems to me that the

record is now fairly clear that when the FBI operates in the

organization of its kind in the world. And when the FBI acts

in the field of political ideas, it has bungled its job, it

has interfered with the civil liberties, and finally, in the

last month or two, through its public disclosures, heaped

shame upon itself and really led toward an undermining of

the crucial public confidence in an essential law enforcement

agency of this country.

In a real sense, history has repeated itself because it

was precisely that problem that led to the creation of the FBI

in 1921.

In world War I, the Bureau of Investigation strayed from

its law enforcement functions and became an arbiter and

protector of political ideas.

And through the interference

of civil liberties and Palmer Raids and

the rest, the public

became so offended that later through Mr. Justice Stone and •

Mr. Hoover, the FBI was created. And the first statement

by MI. Stone was that never again will this Justice Department

get involved in political ideas.

And yet here we are again looking at a record where with

Martin Luther King, with anti-war resistors, with -- we even

had testimony this morning of meetings with the Council of

Churches. Secretly we are investigating this vague, ill-defined,

impossible to define idea of investigating dangerous ideas.

It seems to be the basis of the strategy that people

at odds with the philosophy of American government.

of the union. He did a very fine job. As far as I know, and

I'm beginning to wonder, but as far as I know, we had no help

from the FBI or the CIA. We just ramned them out of the meetings

on the grounds that they weren't Democrats and they weren't

good union leaders when we didn't want anything to do with them.

And yet, we see time and time again that we're going to

protect the blacks from Martin Luther King because he's

dangerous, that we've going to protect veterans from whatever

it is, and we're going to protect the Council of Churches

from the veterans, and so on, and it just gets so gummy and

confused and ill-defined and dangerous, that don't you agree

with me that we have to control this, to restrain it, so that

precisely what is expected of the FBI is known by you, by the

public, and that you can justify your actions when we ask

you?

Mr. Adams. I agree with that, Senator, and I would like

to point out that when the Attorney General made his statement

Mr. Hoover subscribes to it, we follied that policy for about

ten years until the President of the ..ited States said that

we should investigate the nazi Party.

I for one feel that we should investigate the Nazi Party.

I feel that our investigation of the Nazi Party resulteû in

the fact that in World War II, as contrasted with World War I,

there wasn't one single incident of foreign directed sabotage

which took place in the United States.

Senator Mondale. And under the criminal law you could

have investigated these issues of sabotage.

Isn't sabotage a crime?.

Mr. Adams. Sabotage is a crime.

Senator Mondale. Could you have investigated that?

Mr. Adams.

After it happened.

Senator Mondale. You see, every time we get involved

in political ideas, you defend yourself on the basis of

crimes that could have been comnitted. It's very interesting.

In my opinion, you have to stand here if you're going to

continue what you're now doing and as. I understand it, you

still insist that you did the right thing with the Vietnam

Veterans Against the War, and investigating the Council of

Churches, and this can still go on: This can still-go on under

your

interpretation of your present powers, what you try to

justify on the grounds of your law enforcement activitics

in terms of criminal matters.

Mr. Adams. The law does not say we have to vait. until

we have been murdered before we can --

Senator Mondale. Absolutely, but that's the field of

law again. You're trying to defend apples with oranges.

That.'s

the law. You can do that.

Mr. Adams.

That's right, but how do you find out which

of the 20,000 Bund members might have been a saboteur. You

don't have probable cause to investigate anyone, but you can

direct an intelligence operation against the German-American

Bund, the same thing we did after Congress said --

Senator Mondale: Couldn't you get a warrant for that?

Why did you object to going to court for authority for that?:

Mr. Adams.

Because we don't have probable cause to

go against an individual and the law doesn't provide for

probable cause to investigate an organization.

There were activities which did take place, like one time

they outlined the Communist Party --

Senator Mondale. What I don't understand is why it

wouldn't be better for the FBI for us to define authority

that you could use in the kind of Bonn situation where under

court authority you can investigate where there is probable

cause or reasonable cause to suspect sabotage and the rest.

Wouldn't that make a lot more sense than just making these

decisions on your own?

Mr. Adams. We have expressed complete concurrence in

that. We feel that we're going to gistreat to death in the

next 100 years, you're damned if you i, and damned if you

don't

in this area.

But I won't agree with you, Senator, that we

have bungled the intelligence operations in the United States.

I agree with you that we have made some mistakes. Mr. Kelley

has

set a pattern of being as forthright as any Director of the

FBI in acknowledging mistakes that. had been made, but I think

that as you said, and I believe Senator Tower said, and

Senator Church, that we have to watch these hearings because

of the necessity that we

must concentrate on these areas of

abuse. We must not lose sight of the

overall law enforcement and intelligence community, and I

still feel that this is the freest country in the world.

I've travelled much, as I'm sure you have, and I know we have

made some mistakes, but I feel that the people in the United

States are less chilled by the mistakes we have made than they

are by the fact that there are 20,000 murders a year in the

united States and they can't walk out of their houses at night

and feel safe.

Senator Mondale. That's correct, and isn't that an

argument then, Mr. Adams, for strengthening our powers to go

after those who commit crimes rather than strengthening of

continuing a policy which we now see undermines the public

confidence you need to do your job.

Mr. Adams. Absolutely.

The mistakes we have made are

what have brought on this embarrassment to

us.

I'm not blaming the Committee.

I'm saying we made some

mistakes and in doing so this is what has hurt the FBI. But

at the same ¿ime I don't feel that a balanced picture comes

out, as you have said yourselves, because of the necessity

of zercing in on abuses.

I think that we have done one tremendous job. I think

the accomplishments in the Klan was the finest hour of the

FBI and yet, I'm sure in dealing with the klan that we made

some mistakes. But I just don't agree with bungling.

Senator Mondale. I don't want to argue over terms, but

I think I sense an agreement that the FBI has gotten into trouble

over it in the political idea trouble, and that that's where we

need to have new legal

standards.

Mr. Adams.

Yes, I agree with that.

Senator Tower. Senator Huddleston.

Senator Huddleston.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Adams, these two instances we have studied at some

length seems to have been an inclination on the part of

the Bureau to establish. a notion about an individual or a group

which seems to be very hard to ever change or dislodge. In

the case of Dr. King, where the supposition was that he was'

being influenced by Communist individuals, extensive investi-

gation was made, surveillance, reports came back indicating that

this in fact was untrue, and directions continued to go out

to intensify the investigation. There never seemed to be a

willingness on the part of the Bureau to accept its own facts.

Ms. Cook testified this morning that something similar

to that happened with the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, that

every piece of information that she supplied to the Bureau

seemed to indicate that the Bureau was. not correct in its

assumption that this organization planned to commit violence,

or that it was being manipulated, and yet you seemed to insist

that this investigation go on, and ti-s information was used

against the individuals.

Now, are there instances where the Bureau has admitted that

its first assumptions were wrong and they have changed their

course?

Mr. Adams. We have admitted that. We have also shown

from one of the cases that Senator Hart brought up, that after

five days we closed the case.

We were told something by an

individual that there was a concern of an adverse influence

in it, and we looked into it. On the Martin Luther King

situation there was no testimony to the effect that we just

dragged on and on, or admitted that we dragged on and on and

on, ad infinitum. The wiretaps on Martin Luther King were

all approved by the Attorney General. Microphones on Martin

Luther King were approved by another Attorney General. This

wasn't the FBI, and the reason they were approved was that

there was a basis to continue the investigation up to a point.

What I testified to was that we were improper in discreditir

DI. King, but it's just like -

Senator Huddleston. The Committee has before it memoranda

written by high officials of the Bureau indicating that the

information they were receiving from the field, from these

surveillance methods, did not confirm what their supposition

was.

Mr. Adams. That memorandum was rot on Di. King. That

was on another individual that I thi. somehow got mixed up

in the discussion, one where the issus was can we make people

prove they aren't a Communist before we will agree not to

investigate them.

But the young lady appearing this morning making the

comment that she never knew of anything she told us that

she considers herself a true member of the VAW-WSO inasmuch

as she feels in general agreement of the principles of it, and

agreed to cooperate with the FBI in providing information regard-

ing the organization to aid in preventing violent individuals

from associating themselves with the VAW-WSO. She is most

concerned about efforts.by the Revolutionary Union to take over

the VVAW-WSo, and she is working actively to prevent this..

I think that we have a basis for investigating the VAW-

WSO in certain areas today. In other areas we have stopped

the investigation. They don't agree with these principles

laid down by the --

:

Senator Huddleston. That report was the basis of your

continuing to pay informants and continuing to utilize that

information against members who certainly had not been involved

in violence, and apparently to get them fired from their job

or whatever?

Mr. Adams. It all gets back to the fact that even in the

criminal law field, you have to detect crime, and you have to

prevent crime, and you can't wait until something happens.. The

Attorney General has clearly spoken : that area, and even our

statutory jurisdiction provides that we don't -

Senator Huddleston.. Well, of course we've had considerable

evidence this morning where no attempt was made to prevent

crime, when you had information that it was going to occur.

But I'm sure there are instances where you have.

Mr. Adams.

We disseminated every single item which he

reported to us.

Senator Huddleston.

To a police department which you

knew was an accomplice to the crime.

Mr. Adams. Not necessarily.

Senator Huddleston. Your informant had told you that,

hadn't he?

Mr. Adams. Well, the informant is on one level. We have

other informants, and we have other information.

Senator Huddleston. Yes, but you were aware that he

had worked with certain members of the Birmingham police in

order to --

Mr. Adams. Yes. He furnished many other instances also.

Senator Huddleston. So you weren't really doing a whole

lot to prevent that incident by telling the people who were

already part of it.

Mr. Adams. We were doing everything we could lawfully

do at the time, and finally the situation was corrected, so that

when the Department, agreeing that we had no further. juris-

diction, could sent the United Statcs Marshal down to perform

certain law enforcement functions.

Senator Huddleston. Now, the Committee has received

documents which indicated that in one situation the FBI assisted

an informant who had been established in a white hate group

to establish a rival white hate group, and that the Bureau paid

his expenses in setting up this rival organization.

Now, does this not put the Bureau in a position of being

responsible for what actions the rival white hate group might

have undertaken?

MI. Adams. I'd like to see if one of the other gentlemen

knows that specific case!

because I don't think we set up a

specific group.

This is Joe Deegan.

MI. Deegan. Senator, it's my understanding that the

informant we're talking about decided to break off from the

group he was with. He was with the

Macon Klan group of :

the United Klans of America,

and he decided. to break off.

This

was in compliance with our regulations:

His breaking off,

we did not pay him to set up the organization. He did it

on his own.. We paid him for the information he furnished

us concerning the operation. We did not sponsor the organiza-

tion.

Senator Huddleston. Concerning the new organization that

he set up, he continued to advise you of the activities of that

organization?

Mr. Deegan.. He continued to advi:: us of that organization

and other organizations. He would advise us of planned

activities.

Senator Huddleston, The new organization that he formed,

did it operate in a very similar manner to the previous one?

Mr. Deegan. No, it did not, and it did not last that

long..

Senator Huddleston. There's also evidence of an FBI

informant in the Black Panther. Party who had a position of

responsibility within the Party with the knowledge of his

FBI contact of supplying members with weapons

and instructing

them in how to use those weapons. Presumably this was in the

knowledge of the Bureau, and he later became - came in contact

with the group that was contracting for murder, and he partici-

pated in this group with the knowledge of the FBI agent, and

this group did in fact stalk a victim who was later killed with

the weapon supplied by this individual, presumably all in the

knowledge of the FBI.

How does this square with your enforcement and crime

prevention responsibilities.

Mr. Deegan.. Senator, I'm not familiar with that particular

case. It does not square with our policy in all respects, and

I would have to look at that particular case you're talking

about to give you an answer.

Senator Huddleston. I don't have the documentation on that

particular case, but it brings up the point as to what kind of

control you exercised over this kind of informant in this kind

of an organization and to what extent an effort is made to

prevent these informants from engaging in the kind of thing

that you are supposedly trying to prevent.

Mr. Adams.

A good example of this was Mr. Rowe, who became

active in an action group, and we told him to get out or

we would no longer use him as an informant, in spite of the

information he had furnished in the past.

We have had cases, Senator, where we have had --

Senator Huddleston. But you also told him to participaté

in violent activities.

Mr. Adams. We did not tell him to participate in violent

activities.

Senator Huddleston.

That's what he said.

Mr. Adams. I know that's what he said. But. that's what

lawsuits are. all about, is that there. are. two sides to the

issue, and our agents. handling. this have. advised. us, and I

believe have advised. your staff, that at no time did they

advise him to engage. in violence..

Senator. Huddleston. Just to do what was. necessary to

get the information, I believe maybe might have been his

instructions.

Mr. Adams. I don't think they made any such statement

to him along that line, and we have informants, we have

informants who have gotten involved in the violation of the law,

and we have immediately converted their status from an informant

to the subject, and have prosecuted I would say, offhand, I

can think of around 20 informants that we have prosecuted for

violating the laws, once it came to our attention, and even

to show you our policy of disseminating information on violence

in this case, during the review of the matter, the agents told

me that they found one case where their agent had been working

24 hours a day, and he was"

a little late in disseminating the

information to the police department. No violence occurred,. .

but it showed up in a file review, and he was censured for

his delay in properly notifying local authorities.

So we not only have a policy, I feel that we do follow

reasonable safeguards. in order to carry it out, including periodic

review of all informant. files. .

Senator Huddleston. Well, Mr. Rowe's statement is

substantiated to some extent with the acknowledgement by the

agent in charge that if you're going to be a Klansman and you

happen to be with someone and they decide to.do something, that

he couldn't be an angel. These were the words of the agent,.

and be a good informant. He wouldn't take the lead; but the

implication is that he would have to go along and would have

to be involved if he was going to maintain his credibility.

Mr. Adams.. There's no question but that an informant at

times. will have to be present. during demonstrations, riots,

fistfights that take place, but I believe his statement was

to the effect that

room and I don't recall it exactly, but some of them were

someone with a chain or not, but I rather doubt that he did

because it's one thing being present, and it's

another thing

taking an active part in criminal actions.

Senator Huddleston.. He was close enough to get his

throat cut.

How does the gathering of information -

Senator Tower. Senator Mathias is here, and I think that

we probably should recess a few minutes.

Could we have Senator Mathias' questions and then should

we convene this afternoon?

Senator Huddleston. I'm finished. I just had one more

question.

Senator Tower. Go ahead.

Senator Huddleston. I wanted to ask how the selection of

information about an individual's personal life, social, sex

life and becoming involved in that sex life or social life

is a requirement for law enforcement or crime prevention.

Mr. Adams. Our agent handlers have advised us on Mi.

Rowe, that they gave him no such instruction, they had no

such knowledge concerning it, and I can't see where it would

be.of any value whatsoever.

Mr. Adams.

To get involved in sexual activity? No, sir..

Senator Huddleston. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Senator Tower.

Senator Mathias.

Senator Mathias. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I would like to come back very briefly to the Fourth

Amendment considerations in connection with the use of informants

and in posing these questions we're not thinking of the one

time volunteer who walks in to an FBI office and says I have

a story I want to tell you and that's the only time that you

may see him. I'm thinking of the kind of situations in which

there is a more extended relationship which could be of varying

degrees. It might be in one case that the same individual

will have some usefulness in a number of situations. But when

the FBI orders a regular agent to engage in a search, the first

test is a judicial warrant, and what I would like

to explore

with you is the difference between a one time search which

requires a warrant, and which you get when you make that

search, and a continuous search which uses an informant, or

the case of a continuous search which uses a regular undercover

agent, someone who is totally under your control, and is in a

slightly different category than an informant.

Mr. Adams. Well, we get there into the fact that the

Supreme Court has still held that the use of informants does

not invade any of these constitutionally protected areas, and

if a person wants to tell an informant something that isn't

protected by the Supreme Court.

An actual search for legal evidence, that is a protected

item, but information and the use of informants have been

consistently held as not posing any constitutional problems.

Senator Mathias. I would agree, if you're talking about

the fellow who walks in off the street, as I said earlier,

but is it true that under existing procedures informants are

given background checks?

Mr. Adams. Yes, sir.

Senator Mathias. And they are subject to a testing period.

Mr. Adams. That's right, to verify and make sure they

are providing to us reliable information.

Senator Mathias. And during the period that the relation-

ship continues, they are rather closely controlled by the

handling agents.

•Mr. Adams. That's true.

Senator Mathias. So in effect they can come in a very

practical way agents themselves to the FBI.

Mr. Adams.. They can do nothing --

Senator Mathias. Certainly agents in the common law use

of the word.

MI. Adams. That's right, they can do nothing, and we

instruct our agents that an informant can do nothing that the

agent himself cannot do, and if the agent can work himself into

an organization in an undercover capacity, he can sit there and

glean all the information that he wants, and that is not in the

Constitution as a protected area. But we do have this problem.

Senator Mathias. But if a regular agent who is a inember

of the FBI attempted to enter these premises, he would require

a warrant?

Mr. Adams. No, sir, if a regular -- it depends on the

purpose for which he is entering. If a regular agent by

concealing his identity, by - was admitted as a member of the

Communist Party, he can attend Communist Party meetings, and he

can enter the premises,

he can enter the building, and there's

no constitutionally invaded area there.

Senator Mathias. And so you feel that anyone who has

a less formal relationship with the Bureau than.a. regular

agent, who can undertake a continuous surveillance operation

as an undercover.agent.or as an informant.-

Mr. Adams. As long as he commits no illegal acts.

Senator Mathias. Let me ask you.why you feel that it is

impractical to require a warrant since,.as I understand it,

headquarters must approve the use of an informant. Is that

degree of formal action required?

Mr. Adams. The main difficulty is the particularity

which has to be shown in obtaining a search warrant. You

have to go after particular evidence. You have to specify

what you're going after, and an informant operates in an

area that you just cannot specify. He doesn't know what's

going. to be discussed at that meeting. It may be a plot to

blow up the Capitol again or it may be a plot to blow up the

State Department building.

Senator Mathias. If it were a crininal investigation,

you would have little difficulty with probable cause, wouldn't

you?

Mx. Adams.

We would have difficulty in a warrant to

use someone as an informant in that area because the same

difficulty of particularity

exists. We can't specify.

Senator Mathias.

I understand the problem because it's

very similar to one that we discussed earlier in connection

say wiretaps on a national security problem.

Mr. Adams. That's it, and there we face the problem of

where the Soviet, an individual identified as a Soviet spy

in a friendly country and they tell us he's been a Soviet spy

there and now he's coming to the United States, and if we can't

show under a probable cause warrant, if we couldn't show that

he was actually engaging in espionage in the United States,

we couldn't get a wiretap under the probable cause requirements

which have been discussed, If the good fairy didn't arop the

evidence in our hands that this individual is here conducting

espionage, we again would fall short of this, and that's

why we're

still groping with it:

Senator Mathias. When you say fall short, you really,

you would be falling short of the requirements of the Fourth

Amendment.

Mr. Adams. That's right, except for the fact that the

• President, under this Constitutional powers, to protect this

nation and make sure that it survives first, first of all

national survival, and these are the areas that not only the

President but the Attorney General are concerned in and we're

all hoping that somehow we can reach a legislative middle

ground in here.

Senator Mathias. Which we discussed in the other national

security area as to curtailling a warrant to that particular

need.

Mr. Adams. And if you could get away from probable

cause and get some degree of reasonable cause and get some

method of sealing indefinitely your interest, say, in an

ongoing espionage case and can work out those difficulties,

we may get their yet.

Senator Mathias. And you don't despair of finding that

middle ground?

Mr. Adams. I don't because I think that today there's

more of an open mind between Congress and the Executive Branch

and the FBI and everyone concerning the need to get these

areas resolved.

Senator Mathias. And you believe that the Department,

if we could come together, would support, would agree to that

kind of a warrant requirement if we could agree on the language?

Mr. Adams.

If we can work out problems and the Attorney

General is personally interested in that also.

Senator Mathias. Do you think that this agreement night

extend to some of those other areas. that we talked about?

Mr. Adams. I think that that would be a nuch greater

difficulty in an area of domestic intelligence informant who

reports on many different operations and different types of

activities that might cone up rather than say in a Soviet

espionage or a foreign espionage case where you do have a little

more degree of specificity to deal with.

Senator Mathias. I suggest that we arrange to get

together and try out some drafts with each other, but in the

meantime, of course,

there's another alternative and that

would be the use of wiretap procedure by which the Attorney

General must approve a wiretap before it is placed, 'and the

same general process could be used for informants, since

you come to headquarters any way.

Mr. Adams.

That could be an alte sitive. I think it

would be a very burdensome alternative it I think at some

25

point after we attack the major abuses, of what are considered

major abuses of Congress and get over this hurdle, I think

we're still going to have to recognize that heads of agencies

have to accept the responsibility for managing that agency

and we can't just keep pushing every operational problem up

to the top because there just aren't enough hours in the day.

Senator Mathias. But the reason that parallel suggests

itself is of course the fact that the wiretap deals generally

with one level of information in one sense of gathering

information. You hear what you hear from the tap.

Mr. Adams. But you're dealing in a much smaller number

also.

Senator Mathias. Smaller nunber, but that's all the

more reason.

When an informant goes in, he has all of his

senses. He's gathering all of the information a human being

can acquire from a situation and has access to more information

than the average wiretap.

And it would seem to me that for that reason a parallel

process might be useful and in order.

Mr. Adams.

and neither of the two parties talking had agreed that their

conversation could be monitored.

Senator Mathias. I find that one difficult to accept.

If I'm the third party overhearing a conversation that is taking

place in a room where I am, and my true character isn't perceived

by the two people who are talking, in effect they haven't

consented to my overhearing my conversation. Then they consent

if they believe that I am their friend or their, a partisan

of theirs.

But if they knew in fact that I was an informant for

someone else, they wouldn't be consenting.

Mr. Adams. Well, that's like I believe Senator. llart

raised earlier, that the courts thus far have made this

distinction with no difficulty. but that doesn't mean that

there may not be some legislative compromise which might be

addressed.

Senator Mathias. Well, I particularly appreciate your

attitude in being willing to work on these problems because

I think that's the most important thing that can evolve from

these hearings, so that we can actually look at the Fourth

Amendment as the standard that we.have to achieve. But the

way we get there is obviously going to i

^ lot easier if we

can work toward them together.

deals with whether we shouldn't impose a standard of probable

cause that a crime has been committed as a means of controlling

the use of informants and the kind of information that they

collect.

Do you feel that this would be too restrictive?

Mr. Adams. Yes, sir, I do.

When I look at informants and I see that each year

informants provide us, locate 5000 dangerous fugitives, they

provide subjects in 2000 more cases, they recover $86 million

in stolen property and contraband, and that's irrespective

of what we give the local law enforcement and other Federal

agencies, which is almost a comparable figure, we have almost

reached a point in the criminal law where we don't have much

left. And in the intelligence field we still, I think when

we carve all of the problems away, we still have to make sure

that we have the means to gather information which will permit

us to be aware of the identity of individuals and organizations

that are acting io overthrow the government of the United

States. And I think we still have some areas to look hard

at as we have discussed, but I think informants are here to.

I welcome the interest which this Committee

has shown in the FBI and most particularly in our

operations in the intelligence and internal security

fields.

I share your high regard for the rights

guaranteed by the Constitution and laws of the United

States.

Throughout my 35-year career in law enforcement

you will find the same insistence, as has been expressed

by this Committee, upon programs of law enforcement that.

are themselves fully consistent with law.

I also have strongly supported the concept of

legislative oversight. In fact, at the time my appointment

as Director of the FBI was being considered by the Senate

Judiciary Committee two and one-half years ago, I told

the members of that Committee of my firm belief in

Congressional oversight.

This Committee has completed the most

exhaustive study of our intelligence and security

operations that has ever been undertaken by anyone

NW 54965 DocId: 32989503 Page 122

---

## Page 123

outside the FBI other than the present Attorney General.

At the outset, we pledged our fullest cooperation and

promised to be

as candid and forthright as possible in

responding to your questions and complying with your

requests.

I believe we have lived up to those promises.

The members and staff of this Committee have

had unprecedented access to FBI information.

You have talked to the personnel who conduct

security-type investigations and who are personally involved

in every facet of our day-to-day intelligence operations.

You have attended numerous briefings by FBI

officials who have sought to familiarize the Committee

and its staff with all major areas of our activities

and operations in the national security and intelligence

fields.

In brief, you have had a firsthand examination of

these matters that is unmatched at any time in the history

of the Congress.

As this Committee has stated, these hearings

have, of necessity, focused largely on certain errors

and abuses. I credit this Committee for its forthright

recognition that the hearings do not give a full or

balanced account of the FBI's record of performance.

- 2-

NW 54965 DocId: 32989503 Page 123

---

## Page 124

It is, perhaps, in the nature of such hearings

to focus on abuses to the exclusion of positive accomplishments

of the organization.

The Counterintelligence Programs which have

received the lion's share of public attention and critical

comment constituted an infinitesimal portion of our over-

all work.

A Justice Department Committee which was formed

last year to conduct a thorough study of the FBI's

Counterintelligence Programs has reported that in the

five basic ones it found 3,247 Counterintelligence proposals

were submitted to FBI Headquarters from 1956 to 1971. Of this

total, 2,370 - less than three-fourths -- were approved.

I repeat, the vast majority of those 3,247

proposals were being devised, considered, and many were

rejected, in an era when the FBI was handling an average

of

700,000 investigative matters per year.

Nonetheless, the criticism which has been

expressed regarding the Counterintelligence Programs

is most legitimate and understandable.

The question might well be asked what I had

in mind when I stated last year that for the FBI to have

done less than it did under the circumstances then existing

would have been an abdication of its responsibilities

to the American people.

NW 54965

DocId: 32989503 Page 124

## Page 125

What I said then -- in 1974 - and what I believe

today, is that the FBI employees involved in these programs

did what they felt was expected of them by the President,

the Attorney General, the Congress, and the people of

the United States.

Bomb explosions rocked public and private

offices and buildings; rioters led by revolutionary

extremists laid siege to military, industrial, and

educational facilities; and killings, maimings, and

other atrocities accompanied such acts of violence

from New England to California.

The victims of these acts were human beings -

men, women, and children. As is the case in time of peril --

whether real or perceived - they looked to their Government,

their elected and appointed leadership, and to the FBI and

other law enforcement agencies to protect their lives, their

property, and their rights.

There were many calls for action from Members

of Congress and others, but few guidelines were furnished.

The FBI and other law enforcement agencies were besieged

by demands... impatient demands...for immediate action.

FBI employees recognized the danger; felt

they had a responsibility to respond; and, in good faith,

NW 54965 Docid: 32989503 Page 125

-4-

---

## Page 126

initiated actions designed to counter conspiratorial

efforts of self-proclaimed revolutionary groups, and

to neutralize violent activities.

In the development and execution of these programs,

mistakes of judgment admittedly were made.

Our concern over whatever abuses occurred

in the Counterintelligence Programs - and there were

some substantial ones -- should not obscure the underlying

purpose of those programs.

We must recognize that situations have occurred

in the past and will arise in the future where the

Government may well be expected to depart from its

traditional role -- in the FBI's case, as an investi-

gative and intelligence-gathering agency -- and take

affirmative steps which are needed to meet an imminent

threat to human life or property.

In short, if we learn a murder or bombing is to

be carried out NOW, can we truly meet our responsibilities

by investigating only after the crime has occurred, or

should we have the ability to prevent? I refer to those

instances where there is a strong sense of urgency because

of an imminent threat to human life.

Where there exists the potential to penetrate

and disrupt, the Congress must consider the question of

- 5 -

NW 54965 DocId: 32989503 Page 126

---

## Page 127

whether or not such preventive action should be available

to the FBI.

These matters are currently being addressed

by a task force in the Justice Department, including the

FBI, and I am confident that Departmental guidelines and

controls can be developed in cooperation with pertinent

Committees of Congress to insure that such measures are

used in an entirely responsible manner.

Probably the most important question here

today is what assurances can I give that the errors

and abuses which arose under the Counterintelligence

Programs will not occur again?

First, let me assure the Committee that some

very substantial changes have been made in key areas of the

FBI's methods of operations since I took the oath of

office as Director on July 9, 1973.

Today we place a high premium on openness --

openness both within and without the service.

I have instituted a program of open,

frank

discussion in the decision-making process which

insures that no future program or major policy decision

will ever be adopted without a full and critical review

of its propriety.

WW 54965

DocId: 32989503 Page 127

## Page 128

Participatory management has become a fact

in the FBI.

I have made it known

• throughout our Headquarters

and Field Divisions that I welcome all employees, regardless

of position or degree of experience, to contribute their

thoughts and suggestions, and to voice whatever criticisms

or reservations they may have concerning any area of our

operations.

The ultimate decisions in the Bureau are mine,

and I take full responsibility for them. My goal is to

achieve maximum critical analysis among our personnel without

in any manner weakening or undermining our basic command

structure.

The results of this program have been most

beneficial...to me personally...to the FBI's disciplined

performance... and to the morale of our employees.

In addition, since some of the mistakes of the

past were occasioned by direct orders from higher authorities

outside the FBI, we have welcomed Attorney General Edward

Levi's guidance, counsel, and his continuous availability --

in his own words -- "as a 'lightning rod' to deflect improper

requests."

Within days after taking office, Attorney General

Levi instructed that I immediately report to him any

-7-

NW 54965 DocId: 32989503 Page 128

---

## Page 129

requests or practices which, in my judgment, were improper

or which, considering the context of the request, I believed

presented the appearance of impropriety.

I am pleased to report to this Committee

as I

have to the Attorney General that during my nearly two

and one-half years as Director under two Presidents and

three Attorneys General, no one has approached me or

made overtures -- directly or otherwise - to use the

FBI for partisan political or other improper purposes.

I can assure you that I would not for a moment

consider honoring any such request.

I can assure you, too, in my administration of

the FBI I routinely bring to the attention of the Attorney

General and the Deputy Attorney General major policy questions,

including those which arise in my continuing review of our

operations and practices. These are discussed openly and

candidly in order that the Attorney General can exercise

his responsibilities over the FBI.

I am convinced that the basic structure of the

FBI today is sound. But it would be a mistake to think

that integrity can be assured only through institutional

means.

Integrity is a human quality. It depends upon

the character of the person who occupies the office of

Director and every member of the FBI under him.

I am proud of the 19,000 men and women with

whom it is my honor to serve today. Their dedication,

their professionalism, their standards, and the self-

discipline which they personally demand of themselves

and expect of their associates

are the Nation's ultimate

assurance of proper and responsible conduct at all times

by the FBI.

The Congress and the members of this Committee

in particular have gained a great insight into the problems

confronting the FBI in the security and intelligence fields --

problems which all too often we have been left to resolve

without sufficient guidance from the Executive Branch or

the Congress itself.

As in all human endeavors, errors of judgment

have been made. But no one who is looking for the cause

of our

failures should confine his search solely to the

FBI, or even to the Executive Branch.

The Congress itself has long possessed the

mechanism for FBI oversight; yet, seldom has it been

exercised.

An initial step was taken in the Senate in

1973 when the Committee on the Judiciary established

a Subcommittee on FBI Oversight. Hearings had been

commenced, and we were fully committed to maximum

participation with the members of that Subcommittee.

I laud their efforts.

However, those efforts

are of very recent origin in terms of the FBI's history.

One of the greatest benefits of the study

this Committee has made is the expert knowledge you have

gained of the complex problems confronting the FBI. But

I respectfully submit that those benefits are wasted if

they do not lead to the next step - a step that I believe

is absolutely essential - a legislative charter, expressing

Congressional determination of intelligence jurisdiction for

the FBI.

Action to resolve the problems confronting us

in the security and intelligence fields is urgently needed;

• and it must be undertaken in a forthright manner. Neither

the Congress nor the public can afford to look the other

way, leaving it to the FBI to do what must be done, as

too often has occurred in the past.

This means too that Congress must assume a

continuing role, not in the initial decision-making

process but in the review of our performance.

I would caution against a too-ready reliance

upon the Courts to do our tough thinking for us.

Some

proposals that have been advanced during these hearings

would extend the role of the Courts into the early stages

of the investigative process and, thereby, would take

over what historically have been Executive Branch decisions.

I frankly feel that such a trend, if unchecked,

would seriously undermine the independence of the Judiciary

and cast them in a role not contemplated by the authors

of our Constitution. Judicial review cannot be a

substitute for Congressional oversight or Executive

decision.

The FBI urgently needs a clear and workable

determination of our jurisdiction in the intelligence

field, a jurisdictional statement that the Congress finds

to be responsive to both the will and the needs of the

American people.

Senators, first and foremost, I am a police

officer -- a career police officer.

In my police experience,

the most frustrating of all problems that I have discovered

facing law enforcement in this country - Federal, state, or

local - is when demands are made of them to perform

their traditional role as protector of life and property

without clear and understandable legal bases to do so.

I recognize that the formulation of such a

legislative charter will be a most precise and demanding

task.

- 11 -

NW 54965

DocId: 32989503 Page 132

## Page 133

It must be sufficiently flexible that it

does not stifle FBI effectiveness in combating the

growing incidence of crime and violence across the

United States.

That charter must clearly address the

demonstrated problems of the past; yet, it must amply

recognize the fact that times change

and so also do

the nature and thrust of our criminal and subversive

challenges.

The fact that the Department of Justice has

commenced the formulation of operational guidelines

governing our intelligence activities does not in any

manner diminish the need for legislation. The responsibility

for conferring jurisdiction resides with the Congress.

In this regard, I am troubled by some proposals

which question the need for intelligence gathering, suggesting

that information needed for the prevention of violence can

be acquired in the normal course of criminal investigations.

As a practical matter, the line between intelligence

work and regular criminal investigations is often difficult

to describe. What begins as an intelligence investigation

may well end in arrest and prosecution of the

subject.

But

there are some fundamental differences between these

- 12 -

NW 54965 DocId: 32989503 Page 133

---

## Page 134

investigations that should be recognized - differences

in scope, in objective and

I in the time of initiation. In

the usual criminal case,

a crime has occurred and it

remains only for the Government to identify the perpetrator

and to collect sufficient evidence for prosecution.

Since

the investigation normally follows

• the elements of the

crime, the scope of the inquiry is limited and fairly

well defined.

By contrast, intelligence work involves

the gathering of information, not necessarily evidence.

The

purpose may well be not to prosecute, but rather

to thwart crime or to insure that the Government has

enough information to meet any future crisis or emergency.

The inquiry is necessarily broad because it must tell

us not only the nature of the threat, but also whether

the threat is imminent, the persons involved, and the

means by which the threat will be carried out.

The ability

of the Government to prevent criminal acts is dependent

on our anticipation of those unlawful acts. Anticipation,

in turn, is dependent on advance information -- that

is intelligence.

Certainly, reasonable people can differ on

these issues.

Given the opportunity, I am confident

that the continuing need for intelligence work can be

documented to the full satisfaction of the Congress.

We

- 13 -

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 134

---

## Page 135

recognize that what is at stake here is not the interests

of the FBI, but rather the interests of every citizen

of this country. We recognize also that the resolution

of these matters will demand extensive and thoughtful

deliberation by the Congress.

Io this end, I pledge the

complete cooperation of the Bureau with this Committee

or its successor in this important task.

In any event, you have my unqualified assurance

as Director that we will carry out both the letter and

the spirit of such legislation as the Congress may enact.

I welcome the opportunity to talk again with this

Subcommittee. During the months since I last testified

here there has been much discussion about various incidents

which I described to you last February 27 involving the

Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The FBI's domestic security investigations have

received the most attention. And much of it has centered on

COINTELPRO, which was revealed to this Subcommittee before I

arrived at the Department of Justice and about which I

provided further details by letter on May 17, 1975, when they

came to my attention.

From the beginning, this Subcommittee has been interested

in the FBI's domestic security investigations. But it has

also been concerned with the whole range of FBI practices.

During my last appearance before this Subcommittee I promised

to start work preparing guidelines to govern FBI practices in

the future. The preparation of those guidelines has been slow

and difficult--much slower and more difficult than I had

realized. The problems are complex and important--as important

as any now facing the Department of Justice. I had hoped when

I first appeared before this Subcommittee that I would be

able to present to you at my next appearance a complete set

NW 54965

DocId: 32989503 Page 163

---

## Page 164

- 2 -

of guidelines. This has proven impossible. But progress

has been made in drafting guidelines in several areas. You

have been provided with the most recent drafts of proposed

guidelines covering White House inquiries, investigations for

congressional staff and judicial staff appointments, the handling

of unsolicited mail, and domestic security investigations.

These draft guidelines cover many of the areas that have been

of greatest concern to this Subcommittee.

Because the statutory base for the operation of the

FBI is not satisfactory, I know the members of this Subcommittee

have been considering what changes it should enact. The

guidelines may be helpful in these deliberations.

Before

discussing briefly each of the draft guidelines you have seen,

I would like to make a few points

about the question of

statutory changes.

The basic statutory provision concerning the FBI is

28 U.S.C. 533 which provides that the Attorney General may

appoint officials "(1) to detect and prosecute crimes against

the United States; (2) to assist in the protection of the

President; and (3) to conduct such investigations regarding

official matters under the control of the Department of Justice

and the Department of State as may be directed by the Attorney

General." In addition, 28 U.S.C. 531 declares that the Federal

Bureau of Investigation is in the Department of Justice. There

NW 54965 DocId: 32989503 Page 164

---

## Page 165

- 3 -

are other statutes, such as the Congressional Assassination,

Kidnapping and Assault Act, which vest in the Bureau certain

special responsibilities to investigate particular criminal

violations.

There are also Executive Orders and Presidential

statements and directives placing investigatory responsibility

upon the Bureau.

In some areas--such as domestic security--the simple

statutory base I have just described is overlaid with a

series of executive orders (for example, Executive Order 10450

concerning the federal loyalty program) and directives dating

back decades. The simplicity of the statute vanishes when

placed in this setting. Moreover, the authorized work of the

Bureau in terms of crime detection must be seen in the context

of statutes passed by Congress such as the Smith Act, 18 U.S.C.

2385, the seditious conspiracy law, 18 U.S.C. 2384, and the

rebellion and insurrection statute, 18 U.S.G. 2383. I would

like to begin the discussion today by suggesting a few

considerations that should be taken into account in deciding

what statutory changes should be made to define more clearly

the areas of the Bureau's jurisdiction and the means and

methods which the Bureau is permitted to use in carrying out

its assigned tasks.

First, there is a temptation to resort to having the

courts make many difficult day-to-day decisions about investigations.

When a Fourth Amendment search or seizure is involved, of

NW 54965 DocId: 32989503 Page 165

course,

recourse to a court for a judicial warrant is in most

circumstances required. But the temptation is to extend the use

of warrants into areas where warrants are not constitutionally

required.

For example, as you know it has been suggested

that the FBI ought to obtain a warrant before using an informant.

Extending the warrant requirement in this way would be a major

step toward an alteration in the basic nature of the criminal

justice system in America. It would be a step toward the

inquisitorial system in which judges, and not members of the

executive, actually control the investigation of crimes. This

is the system used in some European countries and elsewhere,

but our system of justice keeps the investigation and

prosecution of crime separate from the adjudication of criminal

charges. The separation is important to the neutrality of the

judiciary, a neutrality which our system takes pains to protect.

There is another, related consideration. To require

judges to decide whether particular informants may be used in

particular cases would bring the judiciary into the most

important and least definable part of the investigative process.

Even disregarding the problem of delay to investigations and

the burden that would be placed upon courts, we must ask our-

selves whether the control of human sources of information--

which involves subtle, day-to-day judgments about credibility

and personality--is something judges ought to be asked to

undertake. It would place an enormous responsibility upon courts

which either would be handled perfunctorily or, if handled with

care, would place a tremendous burden of work on federal judges.

In drafting statutory changes, it must be remembered

that rigid directions governing every step in the investigative

process could sacrifice the flexibility that is necessary if

an investigative agency is to adapt to the diverse factual

situations it must face.

Rigid statutory provisions would

invite litigation at every step in the investigative process.

Such litigation could very well be used by clever individuals

to frustrate legitimate law enforcement efforts without

achieving the measure of control for which the statutes were

enacted. As Lord Devlin has said, "As soon as anything has

been codified, there is a lawyer-like--but sometimes unfortunate--

tendency to treat the written word as if it were the last

word on the subject and to deal with each case according to

whether it falls on one side or the other of what may be a

finely drawn boundary."

These considerations do not in any way mean that Congress

ought not act to clarify the FBI's statutory base. I want

to emphasize my belief that Congress should do so. The

problems I have mentioned are surmountable. The Department of

Justice is ready to work with Congress in drafting statutes

that will meet the issues that have been raised about the

responsibilities of the FBI.

The proposed guidelines are part of our effort to

cooperate with Congress in meeting its legislative responsibility.

Some of what has been proposed in the guidelines may be useful

NW 54965

DocId: 32989503 Page 167

## Page 168

- 6 -

in drafting statutes. Other parts of the guidelines may

best be left to regulations or Executive Orders. As I said

in my earlier testimony before this Subcommittee, consultation

with you and with other Congressional committees is an

important part of the process by which these guidelines can

be perfected. There will not be complete agreement about what

has been proposed--indeed, within the Department of Justice

there is some disagreement about some provisions--but this is

inevitable and is a necessary part of the road we must travel.

We welcome discussion, which is also essential. Let me then

briefly describe the four proposed guidelines that have been

substantially completed and have been provided to you. Others--

which will cover criminal investigations, use of informants,

counter-intelligence investigations and other areas--are

currently being drafted by a committee within the Department

chaired by Mary Lawton, Deputy Assistant Attorney General in

the Office of Legal Counsel, and composed of representatives

of the Civil Rights and Criminal Divisions, the Office of

Policy and Planning, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and

the Attorney General's Office. As new guidelines are drafted

in these areas they, too, will be made available to you:

When I testified before this Subcommittee last

February I described a number of incidents which occurred

in a period dating back more than a decade in which the

FBI was misused for political purposes. I

noted that in

most cases we discovered where the White House was

• involved

NW 54965

DocId: 32989503 Page 168

---

## Page 169

-7-

the initiation of an improper request was made by a White

House staff member--acting in the President's name--to a

counterpart in the FBI. These requests were often made

orally.

White House

staff members in a number of different

positions were involved.

As you know, the FBI conducts background investigations

of persons being considered for appointment by the President

either to positions in government departments or agencies of

to the White House staff. The FBI also checks it files and

sometimes conducts further investigations of persons who will

be in contact with the President or who will be given access

to classified information. The guideline concerning White

House inquiries sets up a procedure--which is already

substantially being followed--which requires that requests

for all such investigations be made in writing by the President

or the Counsel or Associate Counsel to the President. Under

the proposed guidelines the request for an investigation would

have to certify that the person to be investigated has

consented to the investigation with the knowledge that information

gathered in the investigation would be retained by the FBI.

The consent provision is important as a mechanism for preventing

investigations in fact sought for political or other purposes

from being initiated in the use of background investigations.

It is also important as a protection of the privacy interests

of persons to be investigated.

There are provisions requiring

MW 54965

DocId: 32989503 Page 169

---

## Page 170

- 8-

that access to information provided to the White House be

strictly limited to those directly involved in the matter

for which the investigation was initiated. Custodians of

the files in the White House would be required to keep a

list of all persons who were given access. The proposed

guidelines concerning congressional staff and judicial staff

appointments take the same basic approach as the guidelines

concerning White House inquiries.

In addition the White House has been following the

practice, which perhaps should be embodied in the guidelines,

of directing through the

: Attorney General's Office all requests

for investigation or for material from Bureau files except

routine background checks. This was not the policy in the

past.

It reflects the Attorney General's role, which I

described to you last year,

as a lightning rod to deflect

improper requests.

The proposed guidelines on the White House inquiries

and on other matters accept the proposition that FBI files

should be destroyed after a reasonable period of time. The

deadlines for destruction of files have not yet been specified,

however, because for administrative reasons these deadlines

must be coordinated throughout the FBI file system.

The last time I appeared before this Subcommittee many

members were concerned about the handling of unsolicited

derogatory information received by the FBI. Unsolicited

NW 54965

DocId: 32989503 Page 170

---

## Page 171

- 9 -

information can be very valuable in law enforcement, as you

know, but the concern has been that allegations about the

private lives and habits of individuals have found their way

into FBI files where they may remain for great lengths of

time as a silent but troublesome invasion of individual

privacy. In my testimony of last February 27, I suggested

that on balance it would be desirable to devise some procedure

under which some information in Bureau files would be destroyed.

The guidelines concerning unsolicited information set up a

procedure for the early destruction of such information when

it does not relate to matters within the jurisdiction of the

federal government or does not make an allegation of a serious

crime within the jurisdiction of state or local police agencies.

The draft guidelines provide for destruction of such unsolicited

information within 90 days. The period after which other files

would be required to be destroyed may vary. Information collected

in background investigations might be retained long enough

to avoid the need to repeat investigative steps as an individual

moves from job to job within government or out of government

and later back in.

On the other hand, destruction of files

developed in preliminary domestic security investigations may

be required quite quickly if information indicating criminal

conduct is not developed.

Finally I come to the proposed guidelines concerning

the controversial area of domestic security investigations.

I have already testified about these guidelines before the

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Since that testimony,

several changes have been made in the draft. You have been

provided with the latest draft of these guidelines. There

are several important features I would like to describe.

First, the proposed domestic security guidelines

proceed from the proposition that government monitoring of

individuals or groups because they hold unpopular or controversial

political views is intolerable in our society. This is the

meaning of the warning issued by former Attorney General

• Harlan Fiske Stone, as I read it. Stone said, "There is always

the possibility that a secret police may become a menace to

free government and free institutions, because it carries with

it the possibility of abuses of power which are not always

quickly apprehended or understood. ..It is important that

its activities be strictly limited to the performance of those

functions for whichit was created and that its agents themselves

be not above the law or beyond its reach. ..The Bureau of

Investigation is not concerned with political or other opinions

of individuals. It is concerned only with their conduct and

then only with such conduct as is forbidden by the laws of

the United States. When a police system passes beyond these

limits, it is dangerous to the proper administration of justice

and to human liberty, which it should be our first concern to

cherish."

NW 54965 DocId: 32989503 Page 172

---

## Page 173

- 11 -

The proposed guidelines tie domestic security

investigations closely to the violation of federal law.

I realize there is an argument as to whether the guidelines

tie domestic security investigations closely enough or too

closely to the detection of criminal misconduct. But the

main thing in my opinion is that the purpose of the investigation

must be the detection of unlawful conduct and not merely the

monitoring of disfavored or troublesome activities and surely

not of unpopular views. This is accomplished in the guidelines

by requiring some showing that the activities under investigation

involve or will involve the use of force or violence and the

violation of federal law. I must admit there is a problem--

in part a drafting problem but perhaps more than that--of how

to describe or set forth a standard which further specifies what

is meant by "some showing."

Because investigations into criminal conduct in the

domestic security area may raise significant First Amendment

issues, the proposed guidelines provide for compendious reporting

on such investigations to the Department of Justice. In general

the guidelines provide for a much greater involvement by the

rest of the Department of Justice and the Attorney General in

reviewing FBI domestic security investigations. The emphasis

upon departmental and congressional review is important, but

it must be recognized that the Bureau must have primary

responsibility for controlling itself. The guidelines attempt

to strike an appropriate balance. Periodic reports by the

Bureau of preliminary investigations would be required. All

NW 54965 DocId: 32989503 Page 173

---

## Page 174

-12 -

full investigations would have to be reported to the Attorney

General or his designee within one week of their opening. The

Attorney General or his designee could close any investigation.

FBI Headquarters would be required to review the results of

full investigations periodically and to close any when it

appears

that the standard for opening a full investigation is

not satisfied and all logical leads have been exhausted or are

not likely to be productive. Each open case would be reviewed

annually in the Department of Justice and would be closed if

no longer justified under the standards. The personal approval

of the Attorney General would be required when such sensitive

techniques

as Title III electronic surveillance or preventive

action are to be used, and the Attorney General would be

required to report to Congress periodically on the instances,

if any, in which preventive action was taken.

Preliminary investigations--which would not involve

the infiltration of informants into organizations or groups

or such techniques as electronic surveillance or mail covers--

would be authorized only on the basis of information or

allegations that an individual, or individuals acting in

concert, may be engaged in activities which involve of will

involve the use of force or violence and the violation of federal

law for one of five designated purposes. Those criminal

purposes are:

(1) overthrowing the government of

the United States or the government

of a State;

NW 54965

DocId: 32989503 Page 174

---

## Page 175

- 13 -

(2) interfering, in the United States,

with the activities of a foreign

government or its authorized represen-

tatives;

(3) impairing for the purpose of

influencing U.S. government policies

or decisions:

(a) the functioning of the

government of the United States;

(b) the functioning of the

government of a State; or

(c) interstate commerce.

(4) depriving persons of their civil

rights under the Constitution, laws,

or treaties of the United States; Or

(5) engaging in domestic violence or

rioting when such violence or rioting

is likely to require the use of the

federal militia or other armed forces.

Preliminary

investigations would be limited to inquiries of

public record and other public sources; FBI files and indices;

federal, state and local records; and existing informants

and sources. Interviews and physical surveillance undertaken

for the limited purpose of identifying the subject of the

investigation would be allowed, but interviews or surveillance

for any other purpose would require the written authorization

of the Special Agent in Charge of the appropriate Bureau field

office:

NW 54965 DocId: 32989503 Page 175

---

## Page 176

- 14 -

The draft guidelines provide that such intrusive

investigative techniques as infiltration of informants into

organizations and use of electronic surveillance and mail

covers may only be initiated as a part of full investigations.

The guidelines set out the following standard for the opening

of a full investigation:

"Full investigations must be

authorized by the FBI Headquarters.

They may only be authorized on the

basis of specific and articulable

facts giving reason to believe that

an individual or individuals acting

in concert are or may be engaged in

activities which involve or will

involve the use of force or violence

and the violation of federal law for

one or more" of the five purposes I

mentioned earlier.

A provision is also included to allow the FBI to

investigate for limited periods of time in situations in which

domestic violence or rioting not violating federal law is

likely to result in a request by a governor or legislature of

a state under 10 U.S.C. 331 for the use of federal troops.

You will recognize that the standard for opening a

full investigation proposed in the guidelines is the equivalent

of the standard for a street stop and frisk enunciated by

NW 54965

DocId: 32989503 Page 176

---

## Page 177

- 15 -

the Supreme Court in Terry v. Ohio. There the Supreme Court

wrote that in justifying a street search a police officer "must

be able to point to specific and articulable facts which,

when taken together with rational inferences from those facts,

reasonably warrant the intrusion." In his summation of the

holding of the Court, Chief Justice Warren wrote:

We.. hold today that where a police

officer observes unusual conduct which leads

him reasonably to conclude in light of his

experience that criminal activity may be

afoot and that persons with whom he is

dealing may be armed and presently dangerous,

where in the course of investigating this

behavior he identifies himself as a police-

man and makes reasonable inquiries, and

where nothing in the initial stages of the

encounter serves to dispel his reasonable

fear for his own or others' safety, he is

entitled for the protection of himself

and others in the area to conduct a

carefully limited search of the outer

clothing of such persons in an attempt to

discover weapons which might be used to

assault him. (emphasis added) (392 U.S. 1, 30)

AW 54965

DocId: 32989503 Page 177

---

## Page 178

-16 -

This standard was adopted because it requires a

strong showing of criminal conduct before a full investigation

is authorized. I should point out that a change was made

in this part of the guidelines since my testimony before

the Senate Select Committee. Originally the standard had

required a showing of specific and articulable facts giving

reason to believe that the subjects of the investigation are

engaged in activities that involve or will involve force and

violence and the violation of federal law. The change to the

phrase "are or may be" brings the formulation of the

standard more closely in line with the Terry standard. The

previous language of the guidelines proved to be too close

to the arrest standard--that is, too restrictive as a

standard for the opening of an investigation. The close

correspondence of the revised draft's standard with the Terry

language gives the guidelines' formulation a foundation in the

Supreme Court's analysis of an analagous constitutional problem

which, while it involves a different area of law enforcement,

does provide a definition for the standard which is to control

Bureau activities.

The proposed guidelines go on to require an additional

consideration before a full investigation is opened. The

guidelines state:

[Tihe following factors must be

considered in determining whether a

full investigation should be undertaken:

(1) the magnitude of the threatened

harm;

NW 54965

DocId: 32989503 Page 178

---

## Page 179

- 17 -

(2) the likelihood it will occur;

(3) the immediacy of the threat;

and

(4) the danger to privacy and free

expression posed by a full investi-

gation.

This listing of factors, which has been added in the latest

draft, gives the standard a dimension and explicitness it

did not have in earlier drafts. For example, the balancing

of the factors would require officials of the FBI and the

Department of Justice to close any full investigation even

if there is clear threat of a violation of federal law if

the threatened harm is de minimus or unlikely or remote in

time.

Finally, the draft guidelines provide a procedure to

be followed in emergency situations when action by the FBI to

intervene to prevent the use of illegal force and violence

may be required. This section of the proposed guidelines

has proven to be controversial, in part for fear that it

seeks to allow the FBI to engage in activities of the sort

that were involved in COINTELPRO. As I have said many times

before, the activities that went under the name COINTELPRO

were either foolish or outrageous, and the preventive action

section of the guidelines was not intended to legitimize

such activities, nor would it do so. It was included in the

draft guidelines in the recognition that emergency situations

may arise in which human life or the essential functioning

NW 54965 DocId: 32989503 Page 179

---

## Page 180

- 18 -

of government may be threatened, In such situations law

enforcement officials would be expected to act to save life

or protect the functioning of government. Indeed, law

enforcement officials would be condemned if they did not act.

The preventive action section of the guidelines was designed

to provide a procedure for the Attorney General to authorize

and report to Congress such activities. It was designed to

set up an orderly and careful procedure to be followed in

the case of emergency. It could be supplemented by further

rules developed by the Attorney General. Under the proposed

guidelines the Attorney General could authorize a preventive

action only when there is probable cause to believe that

illegal force or violence will be used and that it threatens

life or the essential functioning of government. The Attorney

General could authorize preventive action only when it is

necessary to minimize the danger, that is, when other techniques

will not work. In the latest draft of the guidelines several

specific prohibitions were included. to make clear that new

COINTELPRO are not to be sanctioned. Prohibited are the

commission or instigation by the FBI of criminal acts; the

dissemination of information for the purpose of holding an

individual or group up to scorn, ridicule, or disgrace; the

dissemination of information anonymously or under false

identity; and the incitement of violence.

It may be that Congress will choose to prohibit any

FBI efforts to intervene to prevent force or violence. But

to do so carries with it a risk and a responsibility.

WW 54965 DooId: 32909503 Page 180

The proposed guidelines are still in the process of

revision. They are tentative. As the guidelines have

been developed they have been shown to the Chairman of this

Subcommittee.

We must enunciate the differences among us

about the best words to use and then seek to resolve those

differences.

But the main thrust of the guidelines is surely

the most important thing, their recognition of the need for a

program for destruction of files in the interest of privacy,

their requirement of consent from the subject of background

investigations, their requirement of progressively higher

standards and higher levels of review for more intrusive

investigative techniques, their requirement that domestic

security investigations be tied closely with the detection

of crime, and their safeguards against investigations of

activities that are merely troublesome or unpopular. Upon

these main themes I hope we all agree.

The Department of Justice has undertaken other steps

to meet some of the issues of concern to this Subcommittee.

We have created an Office of Professional Responsibility to

investigate allegations of improper conduct by Department

personnel and to review the investigations done by internal

inspection units of agencies within the Department. We have

been trying to work out a legislative proposal to bring

national security wiretapping and microphone surveillance

under a judicial warrant procedure. On June 24, 1975, I

NW 54965 DocId: 32989503

Page 181

---

## Page 182

- 20 -

provided the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee with

statistics concerning

, the use of national security electronic

surveillance instituted without prior judicial approval.

Before the Church Committee I recounted the history of

national security electronic surveillance since 1940, revealing

a year-by-year count of the number of telephone and microphone

surveillances. The latest figures in this area show that in

1975 a total of 122 telephone wiretaps and 24 microphone

devices were used to overhear conversations.

We have tried to be cooperative with this and other

committees of Congress about other aspects of the past history

of the FBI and other agencies within the Department. We have

tried to reveal as much as possible about the past out of a

sense of comity and a feeling that the past problems must be

discussed in the process of creating new policy. But we have

tried also to recognize that the past is not always the best

guide to the future. As we review recent history we may be so

overwhelmed by it--and by our failure of memory about the social

and political forces that shaped recent history--that we will

read. its lessons more broadly than we ought to. If there was

a lack of humility in the past about the perfection of our

vision of what was proper, I hope we cannot fail to recognize

the flaws in our vision about the past and the future today.

TW 54965 DocId: 32989503 Page 182

## Page 183

- 21 -

It is a challenging and interesting time, and I hope

together we can prepare ourselves wisely for the future. We

cannot escape from the responsibility of looking at the problems

we face today and are likely to face in the future.

When I testified almost one year ago I stated to this

committee--and I want to emphasize most strongly again today--

that I have both a personal and official concern for the issues

which face us in this area. Those issues are close to the basic

duties of the Attorney General to protect the society--its

values,

and the safety of its members. I am sure that

Director Kelley will agree with me that we must clarify for

the present and for the future the kind of course to be

followed, meticulously and candidly. I believe we have already

made considerable progress in this regard. Together with

Congress legislation can be worked out and wise policy achieved.

As the Supreme Court has observed:

...unless

Government safeguards its own capacity to function and to

preserve the security of its people, society itself could

become so disordered that all rights and liberties would

be endangered. "

As a practical matter, the line between domestic

security work and investigations of ordinary crime is often

difficult to describe. What begins as an intelligence

investigation may well end in arrest and prosecution of

the subject.

I want to emphasize that these investigations are

not undertaken for the purpose of collecting information on

those who hold unpopular or controversial political views.

Their focus is on conduct, not ideas -- conduct that involves

of is likely to involve a violation of Federal law.

But the important distinguishing characteristic of

a successful domestic security case is prevention - they are

undertaken primarily to thwart illegal activities, not to

prosecute. As a consequence, intelligence work involves the

gathering of information, not necessarily evidence.

The purpose

is to insure that the government has enough information at its

disposal to either frustrate or minimize the consequences of

I wish to thank the Committee for the opportunity

to contribute my views for your consideration on legislative

policies and guidelines for the FBI.

My understanding is that your primary concern at

this time is the FBI's investigative responsibilities in the

domestic security area.

We must consider first that these investigations

deal with activities posing a threat to orderly and legally

constituted government - interests which the government has

a special obligation to protect.

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 186

---

## Page 187

the intended harm. As the Supreme Court put it, "the emphasis

of domestic intelligence gathering is on the prevention of

unlawful activity or the enhancement of the Government's

preparedness for some possible future crisis or emergency."

If we are to accomplish these objectives, the FBI

must initiate the investigation in advance of the crime. The

ability of government to prevent criminal acts threatening

domestic security is dependent on our anticipation of their

occurrence.

Anticipation, in turn, is dependent on advance

information -- that is intelligence. Moreover, the interests

involved are too important for the government to wait until

the crime is imminent or an attempt is made before it begins

its

investigative activity.

Let's consider, for the moment, the problem of

terrorism.

Terrorist acts are increasing globally; but more

to the point, terrorist activity is growing in the United

States.

There were 89 bombings attributable to terrorist

activity in 1975 - an average of seven a month. That was

almost double the number in 1974 (45) and more than three

times the number in 1973 (24).

- 3-

NW 54965 DocId: 32989503 Page 187

## Page 188

Eleven people were killed in terrorist acts in •

1975 -- six of them in bombings. Seventy-six persons were

injured in these bombings. Property damage amounted to more

than $2.7 million.

Who is responsible for these brutal and destructive

acts?

--The New World Liberation Front, a revolutionary

group operating primarily in California, boasted of committing

19 bombings. A public utility company was its primary victim.

--The Armed Forces of Puerto Rican Liberation, or

FALN, claimed 18 bombings and one unsuccessful attempt. The

group's favorite targets were government and corporate

facilities -- especially banks -- in New York City, Chicago,

änd Washington, D. C.

The FALN took credit for the bloodiest terrorist

bombing last year, the explosion that killed four people and

injured 53 others on January 24, 1975, at Fraunces Tavern in

New York City. Fraunces Tavern was where George Washington

said farewell to his troops in 1783, and it is the former

home of the New York Stock Exchange.

The FALN's destructive capabilities were amply

demonstrated on October 27, 1975, by its claimed responsibility

for its coordinated, simultaneous attacks on government and

- 4 -

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 188

---

## Page 189

• business buildings in New

York, Chicago and Washington, D. C.

The explosions marked the observance of the first anniversary

of the FALN's existence.

-Other destructive bombings were claimed by the

Continental Revolutionary Army, Red Guerrilla Family, George

Jackson Brigade, Emiliano Zapata Unit and the Chicano Liberation

Front.

The Weather Underground claimed three bombings and

one attempt in 1975. One of the blasts was at the State

Department in Washington; an attempt fizzled at a Department

of Defense facility in Oakland, California.

Four recently published issues of the Weather

Underground's newsletter, "Osawatomie," contained this threat

regarding our Nation's Bicentennial, July 4, 1976: "The rulers

have set the time for the party; let us bring the fireworks."

It should be obvious from this appalling list of violence

that we are not as successful as we would hope to be in dealing

with such matters.

But there have been numerous cases where

information gathered in domestic security investigations made it

possible to thwart or minimize violence or to make prompt arrests,

preventing further incidents of violence.

Let me give you a

graphic example.

In August of 1974, a bomb was discovered at the

United Nations.

FBI Office received information that an attempt had been made

to recruit a resident of Kentucky to participate in a crime to

be committed at the United Nations.

investigation made possible the identification of the individual

making the attempted recruitment. As a result of continued

investigation, this same individual was convicted and sentenced

to serve 25 years.

In addition to terrorist groups, we are also faced with

individuals or organizations who are dedicated to the eventual

violent overthrow of this government. I know there are those

who feel that the government ought not to concern itself or

expend its investigative resources on the prevention of what

might be a remote or highly unlikely occurrence. Reasonable

people can differ on the proper governmental response to these

situations.

Suppose an organization openly espouses revolutionary

doctrine, that is to say, the use of force and violence to

overthrow the government. But it is clear that they will not

take immediate action, or if they did, that they would not be

successful. In the meantime, they actively recruit new members,

- 6 -

and attempt to strengthen their financial resources -- and

wait for the proper moment. I recognize that advocacy alone is

not a violation of Federal law, nor am I suggesting that we make

it one. I am aware also of the special constitutional problems

that are presented by these cases. As Justice Powell put it,

the investigative duty of the executive may be stronger in such

matters, but "so also is there greater jeopardy to constitutionally

protected speech."

It has always been my philosophy as a law enforcement

officer that the government should strive at all times to meet

its obligations for the maintenance of security with the least

possible intrusion on the affairs of its citizens.

But what would you have us do about the presence of

revolutionary organizations in our society? Should they be

totally ignored on the premise that somehow government will

receive an adequate warning that violence is imminent and will be

able to take the necessary measures to prevent the crime or

at least to minimize its consequences. Where is the warning

to come from, if not even the most preliminary and minimal

kind of inquiry is permitted?

As the head of the principal Federal law enforcement

agency in the country, I feel that I would be remiss in my

duties if I were to ignore any group that advocates violence to

accomplish its objectives. Indeed, the Congress has passed a

number of Federal statutes over which the Bureau has investigative

responsibilities, all of which are designed to secure the internal

security of this Nation.

It may well be that the government's investigative

response in such matters should be carefully measured and need

not be as exhaustive or intrusive as our investigations into

completed crimes, particularly those of terrorist groups. But

I submit it would be unrealistic to prevent the government from

obtaining information needed by the executive for sound judgments

about the nature and extent of the threat posed at any given time

by such organizations.

However secure we

may feel today about the strength

and durability of this Nation -- and we have every reason to

feel that way - no one among us can claim any special knowledge

about what tomorrow will bring. Legislation adopted in today's

climate which severely limits the ability of government to

respond effectively to such matters may well prove too

restrictive to meet the needs of the future.

I recognize that Congressional concern in the area

of domestic security investigations has been prompted by past

mistakes or errors in judgment. My own view is that there is

-8-

NW 54965

DocId: 32989503 Page 192

---

## Page 193

no institutional mechanism that can guarantee integrity in

government. In the final analysis, we must place our trust

in individuals. But I realize that more must be done -- it

is not enough to rely on self-restraint.

We have made a commitment to review past FBI

procedures and practices. Investigations in the domestic

security area have been reduced

significantly since July 1973.

As you are aware, the FBI is participating with other

representatives of the Department of Justice in the drafting of

guidelines to govern various areas of FBI operations including

domestic security investigations. These guidelines represent

a positive response to the need for a delineation of the FBI's

proper role and will provide for control and review of the

FBI's performance.

Those portions of the guidelines dealing with the

jurisdictional basis of domestic security investigations are

an appropriate subject for legislation. Other sections might

be put into effect by regulation or Executive Order. Views

may differ on the precise form or content of the guidelines.

Whatever the outcome, they represent a conscientious effort

to deal with one of the most difficult and complex areas of

our investigative responsibilities.

- 9 -

NW 54965

DocId: 32989503 Page 193

## Page 194

The resolution of these matters will demand extensive

and thoughtful deliberation by the Congress. In that regard, I

pledge the complete cooperation of the Bureau and assure you

that we will carry out both the letter and spirit of such

legislation as the Congress may enact.

I want to thank you for giving me the

opportunity to appear before this Committee concerning

a most important issue -- that of oversight.

For some months now, the FBI has undergone a most

exhaustive review of its intelligence operations, as have

other members of the intelligence community. This review

has covered both domestic and foreign intelligence

operations of che FBI.

And I am hopeful that the results of these

extensive reviews will be helpful to the Congress as it considers

practical recommendations for legislative oversight.

NW 54965 DocId: 32989503 Page 198

---

## Page 199

The FBI has in the past recognized and, indeed,

requested a clear delineation of its intelligence responsi-

bilities and authority to conduct investigations in this

extremely sensitive area.

We realize that Congress faces a difficult task

if it decides to draft oversight legislation that will be

of lasting benefit to the American people. Many issues are

involved, and most of them are not easily resolved.

The primary responsibility for correctness

of FBI activities rests in its Director - a responsibility

I readily assume.

I would like to offer for your consideration sone

of the basic questions. I believe must be answere:

(1)

Should Congressional responsibilities

(2)

for oversight of the FBI be consolidated?

Should Congress become actively involved

in the decision-making process of the

administration of the FBI?

(3)

(4)

What is the proper degree - and mode -

of Congressional access to FBI information?

What clearance procedures and controls should

be established for staff members of a

Congressional oversight committee?

## Page 200

As I have previously testified before a

Congressional .Committee and mentioned here today, the

decisions in the FBI are mine and I assume full

responsibility for them. I think the point merits

reiteration.. Some of the mistakes in the past were

occasioned by direct orders from higher authorities outside

the FBI.

We have welcomed Attorney General Levi's guidance,

counsel, and his continuous availability, in his own words,

"as a 'lightning rod' to deflect improper requests."

Within days after taking office, Attorney General

Levi

instructed that I immediately report to him any requests

or practices which, in my judgment, were improper or which,

considering the context of the request, I believed presented

the appearance of impropriety.

I can assure you, also, that in my administration

of the FBI I bring to the attention of the Attorney Genera!

and the Deputy

Attorney General major policy questions,

including those that arise in my continuing review of

our operations and practices. These are discussed openly and

candidly so that the Attorney General can dischorge his

responsibilities with regard to the FBI. •

There is no question in my mind that the basic

structure of the FBI is sound; but it would be a mistake to

- 3 =

NW 54965

DocId: 32989503 Page 200

---

## Page 201

think that integrity can be assured only through institutional

means.

Integrity is a human quality. And the integrity

of the FBI therefore is dependent upon the character of the

Director of the FBI. and every member of the FBI under him.

It will always be so.

I am sure you are aware the Attorney General

created a committee of Department and FBI representatives

to draft guidelines governing

FBI investigations. These

quidelines

have been discussed with various comnittees of

Congress and although not finalized at this time, they

could prove beneficial in the administration of the FBI.

I would like to comment briefly on the matter

of determining the degree and method of access to FBI files

granted to a conmittee having oversight responsibility.

I believe such determination must carefully

consider the questions raised as to the protection of the

integrity of such matter aside from privacy considerations.

Much of the information received by the Bureau is furnished

voluntarily, not only by individuals but by cooperative

foreign governments. They do so in return for an express of

implied promise of confidentiality. The FBI regards such

promises

as binding.

NW 54965 DocId: 32989503 Page 201

---

## Page 202

The establishment of unlimited access could

seriously jeopardize the flow of volunteered information

which is the lifeblood of our investigative organization.

As the number of persons having access to highly

sensitive materials is increased, the chance of an intentional

or inadvertent disclosure also increases.

A perfectly well-intentioned person who legitimately

comes into possession of sensitive information may well

forget, at a later time and in another position, the

circumstances under which he acquired the information.

Law enforcement in this Nation is largely dependent

upon citizen cooperation. Should citizens no longer have

any assurance their identities will be protected, the very

foundation of cooperation upon which the Bureau is so reliant

will be shaken.

Our legitimate concern in this area is borne out

by the fact coucts continue to recognize the special legal

status accorded informants in the law enforcement community,

in that their true identities are protected.

Should the identities of informants be jeopardized

by the unnecessary proliferation of information, there will

be a severe impact on the ability of the FBI to discharge

its mandated responsibilities.

-5.

NW 54965 DocId: 32989503 Page 202

---

## Page 203

We are also concerned about the countless

public-spirited citizens who come forward voluntarily with

information essential for the FBI to function effectively.

Other extremely valuable sources of such information

are cooperative agencies in this country and abroad. Should

the FBI be required to relinguish, over our objections,

information of this nature, it is quite likely we would be

denied such information in the future.

The Select Committees have received unprecedented

access to information from the FBI, within agreed limits; bụt

we

must ask whether the same degree of access should be

allowed, or is essential to, an ongoing oversight committee.

The Select Committees came into being in the Watergate

atmosphere.

Issues were raised that needed to be resolved.

Most of them have been resolved with regard to the FBI.

I must point out that our diligent cooperation in

the endeavors of the Committees stems, in part, from our

own commitment to review the actions of the FBI in the past

in order to better judge the proper role of the FBI in the

future.

An excellent example of this commitment is the

fact we have reduced the number of our domestic intelligence

investigations by 64 percent since July, 1973.

-6-

WW 54965

DocId: 32989503 Page 203

---

## Page 204

As of July 31, 1973, we were handling 21,414

such investigations. By October 30, 1975, we had reduced

that total to 7,686 pending domestic intelligence cases --

a decline of 13,728 cases.

I think this is solid evidence of our responsiveness

even prior to the drafting of proposed guidelines for such

investigations. It isn't necessary for a house to fall on us --

much less two houses.

So I feel compelled to raise this question:

Will the good of the country be better served by

continuing an extraordinary degree of direct Congressional

access to FBI information, or will it be better served by placing

emphasis on requiring the FBI Director to be fully accountable

to an oversight committee through sworn testimony?

I think the Congress and the FBI can perform their

respective tasks with the most advantageous results by the

latter means.

Now, also, I would strongly suggest that consideration

be given to the employment of a permanent, professional staff -

to the extent necessary - for any proposed oversight comnittee,

with stringent clearance procedures.

This would allow the staff members to become

thoroughly knowledgeable concerning the FBI's procedures and

practices and, thereby, facilitate the work of the committee

with proper security.

= 7 =

NW 54965 DocId: 32989503 Page 204

---

## Page 205

As we seek to define the proper degree of

oversight, or review, of FBI operations, we must consider

the administrative burdens such oversight involves.

I should point out that in responding to requests

of the two Select Committees, the FBI at its headquarters

alone expended 3,976 days of Agent personnel and 1,964 days

of clerical personnel from April through December, 1975 --

manpower diverted from investigative duties. In dollars

and cents that represents a cost of approximately $640,500.

Additionally, the cost of conducting background investigations

of committee staff members had reached about $393,699 through

last month.

Now these figures do not take into account personnel

utilized in responding to requests of other committees of

Congress, which have substantially increased during the

past year.

Many of the requests we receive from Congress are

duplicative in nature. Though we diligently try to respond

fully and accurately in each and every instance, it is a

time-consuming and costiy chore. And I feel strongly that

the interests of the American people would be best served

by Congress consolidating its oversight functions.

The manpower of the FBI is limited. With the

increased burden placed on the Bureau by Congressional Committee

requests, and Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act

requests, we have reached the point where the Bureau's

ability to perform its normal investigative functions has

been impaired.

So I would urge you to consider these matters in

your deliberations concerning oversight legislation. I

assure you we will continue to cooperate to the best of

our ability. And I can further assure you that under a

Director held fully accountable and reporting at intervals

to an oversight committee, the FBI can perform efrectively .

and honorably.

Thank you.

cons; 1-26-76

QUESTIONS FROM SENATOR RIBICOFF

QUESTION:

Mr. Kelley, Do you believe that there should be a

Congressional Oversight Committee handling

intelligence matters?

MR. KELLEY: I believe in oversight, Senator. I do not know

whether you mean one which is separated from

the criminal activities performed by the FBI

or not.

If it be fragmentea, I do not

believe that such should be done.

I subscrive

an oversight of both the intelligence activ-

ities in the domestic and foreign security and

the criminal.

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

QUESTION:

I do not think it is anyone's intention in the

oversight committee to take care of the day-

to-day problems that the criminal oversight

has domestically, but in the counterintell

gence fiela, do

you believe that there should

be such an oversight committee?

I do believe that it is necessary that we do

have oversight.

Mr. Colby testified last week that, in his

opinion, after reporting to eight committees,

he feels that the sooner such an oversight

committee is created, the better off the

intelligence community would be. Do you believe

with Mr. Colby?

MR. KELLEY: I do.

QUESTION:

In your statement on page 3--I quote you--you

state that "Some of the mistakes in the

past were occasioned by direct orders from highes

authorities outside the EBI."

Could you please

tell us what mistakes and which higher authorities

you are referring to?

MR. KELLEY: I am referring to the requests, the orders that

have come to us from members of the Department

of Justice, the Attorney General, and these stem

from the installation of some of our electionic

surveillances and from programs that we have

followed which have been with the authority of,

and approval of, those in this area.

not--I do not have a complete outline of then,

but we do have instances where the FBI did not

initiate these.

The orders came from outside

our organization and from, of course, The White

fiouse on some occasions.

NW 54965

Docid: 32989503 Page 207

---

## Page 208

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

QUESTION:

Do you believe that such requests have been

improper under the authority of the FBI?

I do not think by any means that they come

under the

purview of the FBI.

What should a director of the FBI do if he

receives an order from the President, or the

Attorney General or someone in the white House

staff that you believe contrary to what your

responsibilities and authorities are?

should a Director do under those circumstances?

MR. KELLEY:

First, I think that he should deliberate and

talk with the Attorney General, if it be one not

coming from the Attorney General and get his

determination.

If it be one where there is

some doubt, he should get it in writing. If it

be one that he does not under any consideration

nor as a result of deliberation wherein an

effort is made to convince him, but he himself

does not feel that it is advisable then he should

withdraw, he should resign.

And as I was once told

by Senator Burd during confirmation, it is noped

that in such an instance that he would come to the

oversight committee of the Congress and consult

with them about what should be done under these

circumstances.

Of course, that is a matter which

the Director himself has

to arrive at,

and I am

already committed to, and still subscribe to, the

proposition that I am not going to give way just

because it comes

from higher authority.

QUESTION:

If the President of the United States makes

a request of you that you believe to be

improper, and of course, he is your boss,

you would feel honor-bound under those circum-

stances to resign as Director oi the FBI?

MR. KELLEY:

If it came to the final crunch, yes.

QUESTION:

Do you believe that an FBI Director should

have a definite term in office?

MR. KELLEY:

I have been asked this before. I am not uncom-

fortable under the present system where my term

of office is from day to day. I do not believe

that there should be any greater tenure than that.

Insofar as a limitation on ho.. long he can be

Director, I feel that nine or ten years is

sufficient. I do subscribe to that.

-2-

NW 54965 DocId: 32989503 Page 208

## Page 209

QUESTION:

You say also on page 3 that when Mr. Levi

became Attorney General, he instructed you to

report to him any requests or practices which,

in your judgment, were improper or presented

the appearance of impropriety. Have you made

such reports to Mr. Levi?

MR. KELLEY:

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

Yes, sir.

Are they confidential, or could you describe

generally the nature

and frequency of such

improper requests?

Most of them have been in the area of Cointel

Programs which we have discovered ourselves in

some of our flla reviews.

I can remember

another where we determined that there were

certain mail openings which we aid not know

about until we accidentally discovered them.

It was not a failure to inform us, but

they thought that this was an ongoing program

that had been given official approval.

There was no thought that it was something thât

should be hidden. •We did discover them in the

thought that

top echelon of the FBI and, therefore, the thought

is they were new to us they were also new to

Levi and we informed him about them.

QUESTION: In your testimony you stated that the Bureau has

reducad a number of pending domestic intelli

gence investigations

from 21,414 in 1973 to

7,686 by October 30, 1975.

How do you explain

this? Were there too many investigations being

conducted two years prior?

MR. KELLEY:

Senator, when I first came in, I talked with the mar

in charge oi our Intelligence Division. That is

the one where we handle the security matters, and

it was our opinion, together, that there were too

many investigations being conducted in the

security field.

I asked him to review the

bases on which we conduct our investigations.

Obviously it became apparent that some of our

fields of attention could be under close

scruciny.

I felt some undue extensions of our

investigatory capabilities and this was a contin-

uing process,

and the reduction was not something

that was immediate, but extended from, I would say,

the latter part of

173 when we got ourselves

lined up,

right through to october, as it says

in my statement, of '75. We looked over why

it might

well

De, as is many times true in

investigative

circles,

that you might get a little too

concerned about something that on close scrutiny

may not have been quite as alarming as it first

seems.

This is not at all unusual.. It is,

however, unusual that it comes from within

and yes, as a result of the realignment of our

goals--realignment of our procedures--our

basis for investigating matters, we did bring

about this reduction.

MR. CHAIRMAN: Thank you. Senator Percy?

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I would

like to thank Mr. Kelley for his demonstrated

desire and willingness to work with members of

Congress and to help us fulfill our responsibilities.

Former Attorney General Katzenbach testified

last week that he often did not know what the

FBI was doing. What is your own working

relationship with the present Attorney General?

Do you keep him informed of all the major

activities that the FBI is undertaking?

DoEs he

participate in deciding whether or not you

undertake major undertakings?

MR. KELLEY:

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

Senator, we certainly keep him informed of

any major program.

I would say that perhaps

We

may, on occasion, over-inform him.

We may

tell him about things that are antici-

patory

as far

as problems are concerned.

We try to

keep him fully informed. For example, if there

happens to be something we learn about that

may cause press inquiries of him, we inform

him of that.

Many times they are made.

I just point this out inasmuch as we are trying

valiantly to keep him informed.

When do you anticipate new guidelines for the

FBI being finalized?

I cannot give you this response.

It has been

several months in preparation.

I know that it

has now been thrown back into the hopper for

re-evaluation.

I cannot tell you -perhaps

Mr. Levi can give you better information in

that regara.

QUESTION:

As

collow-up on that first question, to

be certain that I complete the record

on it,

can you think now in retrospect in anything

in

your term of office as Director of the FBI

that you really should have advised the Attorney

General of that you maybe subsequently dia,

but did

not at the time?

MR. KELLEY: I cannot think of anything, Senator.

QUESTION:

I asked that, because Dean Rusk said that he

subsequently has now learned of certain

things undertaken in foreign countries by, say,

the CIn that he thought at the time he knew

know, and I wanted to complete that record.

You talk about unlimited access to your files

being dangerous, and I do not think anyone contem-

plates that whatsoever, but I do not think

either that you should be left in the position

where

just your word is the only thing that an

Oversight Committee has.

What do you think is

proper in this respect with respect to reference

to files?

MR. KELLEY: I think that there should be a working arrange

ment between our people and whatever group

might have oversight, and there is a strong

requirement

: that there not be presentation oi

material which would first compromise a source

of information, whether that be a citizen,

a government, or an informant.

The confiden-

tiality of the work done by the FBI is an

extremely important thing. Names are not just

all that reveal the identity.

It may

be that certain

circumstances, when revealed, may

pinpoint what might be the source oi

information.

There might be also too great

a proliferation of information about some activity

of the FBI.

For example, we have, of course, warrantless

wiretaps.

We feel that there should be

confidentiality of that. These have been

authorized through the approval of the President

through the Attorney General's delegated

authority in this regard.

it on measures,

and if they want a review that we extend

ourselves to let them make such review.

You have been able to reduce your domestic

intelligence investigations by 64 percent

since July, 1973. Can you tell us how you have

done that?

By a review that we started in mid-1973 looking

over

the bases fos our investigatory needs and

our intelligence operations, and generally to

take an inventory and say which should we

continue, which should we now perhaps give

additional emphasis, and we culled out, in

other words, those which we did not feel were strictly

productive insofar as meeting our commitments.

Did you fine that you eliminated some of those,

Mr. Kelley, because they were illegal, in

retrospect, as you look back and decided

that the FBI should not, as a law enforcement agency!

should not engage in illegal practices in investigations?

You know, when you speak of illegality, ve have

great difficulty. Sometimes, in the context of

the time, you may open matters which later are

determined to be perhaps possible civil rights

invèstigations, invasions of privacy, or other

background objections. I do not know of any

which, I would say, were actually iilegal.

any that would

meet that

were some eliminated

because they may have

been borderline, and in retrospect in numerality:

you decided

not to go ahead?

MR. KELLEY: I would say that that is a possibility.

In

a strict classification or interpretation

they may be termed an invasion of prIvacy

or rights or somathing of that type.

QUESTION:

Were most of them eliminated because

you felt they were not productive, and to

use a phrase,

they were not really cost-effective,

for the amsant of

energy and effort put into

them? They would

not have paid off?

MR. KELLEY:

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

QUESTION:

say that those would be

iwo great and

major reasons.

With the workload declining 64 percent, has

there been any decline at all in manpower?

Have you shifted manpower to other Division--

... person power., excuse me; man or womanpower--

have you

shifted it to other divisions?

There has been some shifting; much of our

so-called overload of manpower or investigative

attention by this Division has been pickea up

by the terroristic activities investigations.

Of

course, we have had a great rise in that: doubled

each year.

And, strangely enough, during 1975, it

even increased more than that.

We had more

terrorist-type of bombings in 1975 than we

had in 1974.

You mentioned the burden that has been placed

on the FBI by the Congress.

I presume that

there is not any question that the CIA could

rightfully maintain that a tremendous burden

has placed on it by the Congress now.

I think, in retrospect and in fairness, a part

of the burden is unfair, unwarranted, and not

cost-effective.

But a large part of

the burden is

placed simply because we have recognized that we failed

the American people in the past, and no one has

more clearly admitted this than the Majority

leader of the Senate, Senator Mansfield, in his

opening statements before the committee.

SO

that we have to rectify that.

We may overkill,

in a sense.

I hope we will not.

I hope that we will

go a prudent, moderate path and not overreact

to the situation.

burden

But a laige part of that

is because

we simply did not perform the

function in the past and the American peope

know it, they are holding us accountable for

that. I wonder if you could for the record,

lowever, just give us a sense of your owr

ersonal burden, which worries me, both abou

the Director of

the CIA and the Director of the FBI.

How much of your personal time, since you have

assumed office, do you think you have devoted

to preparing for, giving testinony before

Congressional Cormittees, and then following up

on the testimony that has been given, or looking

at the testimony being given by others?

MR. KELLEY: I WOU

say that about 25 percenc of my time

is consumed in going over testimony, reviewing

material, acquainting myself with the progress

of the various committee activities, in pre-

paring myself for testimony, and in testifying;

and I think that the others in the top echelon

of the Bureau who are involved in this type of

thing may have even more than this devoted in

their time. It has increased my work day

considerably, and I find myself many times

reading until the wee hours of the morning.

I am not complaining about it.

I assumed this.

Much more time is devoted to doing my job

now than ever before, again, about 25 percent

of that time is in this area.

, SENATOR:

Mr. Chairman, my time is up. Are we going for

one more round of questions?

MR. CHAIRMAN: If there are more questions.

SENATOR:

I have just a few left. I would like an

answer to how much time you think is appro-

priate for you to spend on this activity,

I will wait until we come back.

QUESTIONS NOW FROM SENATOR BROCK

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Would you clarify for

me something you said earlier. With regard to the

oversight function, I

thought that you said that the

oversight should include all FBI activities.

If that

is the case, you might be in some disagreement, with

those that say we should separate the oversight

of the domestic operations, primarily FBI, from

the international oversight function which

would more relate to CIA.

MR. KELLEY: 75 percent to 80 percent of our time is on criminal

There is, on the other hand, a

great interrelationship between our security

people and our criminal investigations. We may

have a case where we need additional

people in a security matter. We will call on

some people in the criminal activity section.

It is true,

on the other hand, we will have

a big bank robbery or some big fugitive case.

We may call on security people and have them

do it. We have difficulty in setting aside

## Page 215

tha

portion of our budget whi

goes solely

to the so-called intelligence activities. In

the area of intelligence, we have quite a bit

of work in the intelligence field in the

criminal work. We would suggest that it not

be fragmented, and

I would hope that we could

present all of our difficulties to one committee.

I realize that there is the thought that this

thrust should be just toward security matters

foreign and domestic. We have probiems other

than this.

I can see where it would be very

helpful to us to have an overall oversight

which would take care of both of our branches

QUESTION:

The reason I asked the question, there has

been at least some indication among members

of the Senate, that they would like-mat least some

members would like--to

separate the intelligence

from the criminal aspect,

and give the oversight

committee which this committee might create,

jurisdiction over all intelligence, counterintelligence,

domestically and international intelligence but to

leave to the Judicial Comnittee, the principal

oversight responsibility for the FBI.

I gather

that you would not find that a very happy end product?

MR. KELLEY: We report to the Appropriations Committee, and

they outline our programs.

Under this possibility

we would be reporting to an Intelligence

Committee, we would be reporting to the senate

Judiciary Committee on general oversight.

Right away we have three within the Senate.

QUESTION:

If we did give this committee full and complate

jurisdiction, would you also suggest that they

have jurisdiction in terms of appropriations

as well?

In other words, you would limit the

oversight to one committee. It would have

both authorization oversight and appropriation

authority.

MR. KELLEY:

senator, I am not really prepared to give you

an opinion on that. I would say that probably

this should be reserved to the Attorney General.

Personally, of course, it woula probably give

us a closer definition of oversight and night

be that such a committee certainly coula

become best acquainted with our work in ongoing

programs, but I do not know that I can answer

well that pasticular question.

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 215

## Page 216

QUESTION:

not sure that we can eith

As a matter of

fact, there are some of us that feel that rather

than trying to define this thing too precisely,

we should create an oversight committee and

assign to them the responsibility of a study

of the extent of the jurisdictional question.

That may be the best thing that we can

achieve at the moment if we are going to get

any response.

Let me ask you one or

two more questions, again in this same area,

I am reluctant to limit the right of an Over-

sight Committee in terms of access. I think

that is almost something that we can do by

experience, as we have with the Joint Committee

on Atomic Energy.

There the experience has

proven to be good, and I think, healthy for both

sides, Executive and Legislative. I am

distressed

by the leak of information that is ongoing now.

I think it is extremely dangerous yet I

find it difficult to find a way in which we

would limit an oversight committee which may

need some access in order to reach this

definition of responsibility. I do not

know how we would do what you are suggesting,

essentially depends upon the Director and

his testimony before the Committee.

MR. KELLEY:

under our recommendations, we conclude that there

should be investigations and clearances granted to

members of staff, that their numbers, as well as

others for the Committee, should be as limited

as possible. We feel that matters that might

compromise our sources of information are those

that are most important. I think, Senator,

that probably we could start off in such a rela-

tionship being a little extended insofar as

our own desires, we can be a little more

open, and see how it works. I would hope that

it would be sort of an open-end type of thing so that

we can get some history of experiences.

do not want to foreclose the right of review in this

regard. I think, as a citizen, I

an compelled to

say that there should be a better flow of infor-

mation than has been true in the past.

T am

willing to at least explore such a possibility.

It is not.

I am reluctant to eliminate it now because

I think

we may

create an adversary relationship which I do

not think is helpful, where, as an alternative, if

we kept it fairly open, I think a development of that

experience would lead

to a good relationship, as we

have done with the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy

earlier.

MR. KELLEY:

There are misunderstandings about why we

think things are confidential.

Take for

example, a small thing, a release of our telephone

directory.

It is not generally understood that,

by virtue of the release of the telephone directory,

you thererore list the identity of our Agents.

They are listed in the telephone book. There-

after, they get a lot of crank calls.

never did release my address, and as soon as

it was listed--and it was listed of course in

the Congressional Record--I am not complaining

about this--I started receiving crank mail

at my home and some of it was on post cards,

some of it my wife read, it was not the

best thing.

People ão not realize that we

try to protect it foi reasons that we could

possibly explain in an atmosphere of cooperation

with such a committee, and I would look forward to

that opportunity.

We have not communicated

properly, possibly. It it is determined this is

too far fetched, all right, we will drop it. We are

willing to discuss it.

QUESTION:

Thank you. My time has expired. I think what I am

saying is that there is a clear distinction between

a one-shot investigatosy committee which is trying

to get short-term information and a continuing over-

sight committee with a developed relationship on a

maturing basis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. CHAIRMAN: Senator Weicker, while it is your turn, since

Senator Percy has used up his time, he has

requested a few more minutes, if you would yield

to him.

QUESTIONS NOW FROM SENATOR PERCY

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

QUESTION:

Regretfully, I have a witness upstairs in the

Foreign Relations Committee. I was

anxious to

follow up, Mr. Kelley, what proportion of your

time do you think is

appropriate and proper that

you should devote to Congressional oversight? In

other words, we have the same objective to reduce

the burden

on your Department because of the

duplicative activities of the proliferated committees.

What proportion do you think is appropriate for you

to spend?

I have never really considered it, but I would

say that during my ordinary, everyday operations.

I should keep this in mind

each program

with the thought prepared to

discuss it with an oversight committee, maybe

5 percent, just a ballpark figure.

That is a goal I am not sure we will ever

achieve but certainly if we can cut if in half,

it will help, because your principal duty

obviously is

to administer a very able department

and agency.

The thought has been orbited--I threw

it out originally--to just try to cut in half

in area of intelligence because of the tremen-

dous amount of knowledge a person has to gain to

properly authorize in authorizing legislation, and

yet the law--and we are not specialists in this fiela;

we are dealing with specialists in the law enforcement

field--to cut it in half to see if possibly we can

consider in this one oversight committee, giving that

committee both authorization and appropriations

authority so the service would only have to go before

one committee in the Senate and one in the House and

have his job done with and thoroughly inform, say,

a group of nine Senators that would rotate in that

position. Would that, in your juägement, be of

material assistance and help if we could work it out

internally?

If we could, Senator, in one comnittee, I feel this

would be advantageous.

I have long proposed that the Attorney General be

taken out of politics and not be permitted by

procedure or precedent, just as the secretary of

Defense, Secretary of State, has not participated

in politics as such. The Attosney General. has

been.

politically oriented off

se, many times

being the campaign manager. Do you feel that

the Director of the FBI is not a political

position and it should never be permitted--do you

think it would be a good idea for the Attorney

General not to engage in party politics while he

is holding

that office?

MR. KELLEY: I have never had experience with it

since I have come here, in any dealings with

me or with the Bureau by the three Attorneys

General under whom I have worked. There has been

no indication of political influence.

QUESTION:

Do you suggest consolidation of Congressional

oversight of the FBI.

Should that be done by

the same committee overseeing agencies dealing

with foreign intelligence in your judgment?

MR. KELLEY:

QUESTION:

In my judgment, all of the operations of the FBI

would

advantageously be joined in one committee.

One committee?

MR. KELLEY: Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Coula you explain in layman's

term the difference

between foreign and domestic intelligence in

criminal cases as managed administratively by

the FBI? And I ask that with the understanding

that criminal activities involving foreign powers

are not necessarily handled in the FBI's foreign

intelligence division. For example, if

another

country were to finance terrorist acts within

country were to El

the United States, the entire case might be

handled in the Criminal Division. Therefore, it

would help us in our understanding if you could

differentiate between what activities are handled

by each of those bureaus. If you would like to

do that for the record, to make it more complete.

I would certainly accept that.

MR. KELLEY: I would prefer to prepare this in a response to you

and will do so.

QUESTION:

Mr. Kelley, finally, FBI activities seem to be at

the heart

of one of the gray areas of oversight,

I think we are in general agreement that Congress

should create a committee that would oversee the

CIA and NSA.

What aspects of the FBI that should

be looked at by this committee is another matter.

What are your views on this?

MR. KELLEY: Could I also give you that response-may I respond

to thât in writing also?

SENATOR:

up.

I would simply like to say having known

Attorney General Levi

as a trustee at the University of Chicago, I

think the tone and attitude that he is establishing,

the relationship that he has established with you

and which has been a cause of great concern between

the FBI Directors of the past have not been fully

satisfactory and fully cooperative.

I think that relationship that has been estab-

lished has

been an outstanding accomplishment,

and I think your testimony to that effect here

is very important indeed, and I certainly

commend both you and Attorney General Levi, because

a great deal has

been accomplished already.

MR. CHAIRMAN: Senator Weicker?

SENATOR:

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

QUESTIONS NOW FROM SENATOR WEICKER

QUESTION:

I notice in your statement you make mention

of the fact that since 1975, or April through

that state

December, 1975, a great amount of time, effort,

and money wes

expended on responding to

Congressional inquiries, et cetera. I think we

both might also allude to the fact that that

is directly attributable to the fact that there

was no Congressional inquiry for many years before

that,

and what in effect you have seen is an extreme

reaction to an extreme situation. As a maiter of

fact,

as I understand it, and prior to the impeach-

ment

inguiry neither the

House nor the Senate judiciary

Committees held any hearings on FBI oversight. Is

that correct, to your knowledge?

MR. KELLEY: I do not recall this, Senator.

QUESTION:

I believe that was before your time, but that is

the record.

MR. KELLEY: I am thinking only during the time that I have

been here. I do not recall just when we first

Ieported to the Oversight Committee. It was

during the time that Mr. Saxbe was Attorney General.

We appeared three times. Prior to that I do not

know.

QUESTION:

I th

k it is important to poin

out that I am

sure

the American people are just as appalled

about your being overburdened with Congressional

inquiries as they are with no Congressional

inquirias. But that is the record.

There is nothing

in between. I think that is important to point

out as we try to devise some system, some apparatus,

to bring balance to all this. We need the FBI. As

I said the other day, we need a CIA.

There is no

reason why a choice has to be made between o and 100

percent insofar as it is using up your time,

the CIA or any of our law enforcement agencies.

My concern, believe me, Director, is not that

you are going to be overburdened with oversight.

As I have indicated, unless this Congress acts

very shortly, the whole thing is going to be

forgotten and we are going to go back to zero

again.

That is a far greater danger in my

book than your being overburdened. I would

suggest to you, it is very strange to say, that

I would hope that you, along with Mr. Colby and

others in the law enforcement community, would

fight very hard to see this oversight legislation

implemented, because on that depends the survival

of your agency, on that depends a restoration of

confidence as

far as the American people are

concerned in the law enforcement and intelligence

agencies. I fear the bureaucratic footaragging

is going to go on around here two years, five

years from now.

We will be right back at square

A, except the next time that any other abuses

get uncovered, that is going to be the end of

your agency.

There is going to be no way of coming

bäck in tha

room to construct something that

makes sense. That is my concern.

MR. KELLEY:

I went on record during my confirmation sponsoring

oversight, and I still feel that it is a very viable

and proper precedure. I have no objection to it

whatsoever, and

I welcome it.

QUESTION:

I notice you say you favor a new oversight

committee.

Is it your feeling that the present

oversight mechanisms are not adequate?

MR. KELLEY: I hope I have not indicated that I

am critical of

the present oversignt.

I hope that we can have

a centralized oversight whereby our intelligence

and our criminal investigatory responsibilities

are best included in this one.

Under the projected

possibilities, the Bureau would be fragmented,

me would have an oversight of the security

of the national counterintelligence field and

MR. KELLEY:

the

iminal field maintained

the present

oversight system. I would hope that it would

be together.

We do report to the Appropriations

Committee and we do report to the Judiciary

Committee

on Oversight.

If it were fragmented

further, we would have three oversight committees.

Do you feel that the present system of oversight

as embodied in the House and Senate Judiciary

Committees should be supplanted by a new Oversight

Committee, or are you satisfied with the present

system?

I would reserve the final determination to

consultation

as I would want to do, of course,

with Mr. Levi to get together and do this. I

would say, primarily, our goal is to have

it centered not in any particular committee.

I think that is the responsibility of Congress, actually.

What we want to do is not fragment it, not

proliferate it, but to have it so that we can

have one group to which we can go for considera-

tion of our problems and outline our procedures.

I can appreciate, Mr. Director, that

you still have to work with the Senate and House

Judiciary Committees and obviously we don't

want to ruffle any feathers.

We want to

plot à future course.

We are not trying to

find out how we can live with the past.

difficulty is, as I perceive it, not that the

mechanism was not there for oversight--it was

there.

The problem was that it was a secondary

function of the particular committee, in this

case the Judiciary Committee, something

down

the line. Do you feel that your agency and its

activities are of sufficient importance that

that should be a full-time job, rather than a

secondary job, for a Congressional

• committee?

I responded to a question

asked by Senator

Percy about how much time I thought I might be

devoting to the oversight requirement.

thought about 5 percent.

That is just a

ballpark figure. I do not think that that would

necessarily mean that one committee would

be set aside for just that type of deliberation.

I think that if it were to include all of our

activities, criminal as well as security, that it

might

take

a little more, but still, 1 do not

think

that

things come up that frequently

where

it would be a real heavy task for any

QUESTION:

MR. KEILEY:

QUESTION:

YOu

derstand what we are cont

plating here

would be a committee whose intention would

be directed toward the FBI, the CIA, the law

enforcement intelligence community? It

would not just be the FBI; it would also be the CIA.

What I am saying, I think what others are trying

to get across is, is this sufficiently important

to this Nation, to its life and to its Constitution,

that that is a full-time job and not a secondary

job for some other Cormittee, be it the FBI which

is a secondary function of Judiciary, or the CIA,

which is a secondary function of Armed Services.

This is a primary function.

At least, I do not

find it a primary function of law enforcement

intelligence.

That is why my question to you, whether

you are satisfied with the present system, which

obviously has not worked in the past, with a warning

could work, or whether we are best just having one

committee that would work with these law enforcement

intelligence agencies and start from scratch and once

again try to rebuild confidence.

It really does not make any difference what you think

or what I think or what Senator Ribicoff thinks or

our colleagues here think.

The fact is that the

American people have lost their confidence.

That is

the group we have to reach. Whether I ain

satisfied

that you are a fine man with great integrity

and a fine Director, it does not nean anything,

me, that is not important.

What the American people think is what is very

important.

That is what is jeopardizing your

Agency now and, indeed, the Congress.

I would construe anything which is developed

by Congress as something which we would certainly

try to work under.

We will not complain,

You will not have any beefs from us.

I tola

Senator Brock that I would certainly work as best

we can with the system that is devised. I repeat

that to you, too.

I am not going to argue

about

it.

I would like to work with you just as closely

as we

can.

Intelligence Reports

It is essential to its national interest

that the United States maintain an in-

:telligence and counterintelligence capa-

bility, including a corert one.

:: The requirements of democracy tend

to conflict with the need for secrecy

Thus the Senate Select Committee on

Intelligence Activities, which recently

issued voluminous reports on foreign,

military and domestic intelligence. has

properly recommended that secret'ac

• tions should be consistent with publicly

defined foreign-policy goals and "should

be reserved for extraordinary circum-

istances when ne other means will suf-

fice."

We agree, too, with the committee's

recognition that oversight of the coun-

try's intelligence functions by the execu-.

tive hranch and by Congress has been

historically weak, and with the recom-

mendation for tighter supervision.

"aurever, neither the Senate cor

the real problem: The violation of laws

and the subsequent coverums. Despite

all the intelligence agency abuses docu-

rights via break-ins, illegal surveillance

and harassment of individuals and

groups, and drug tests on unsuspectin

persons, the Justice Department has no

made a single move to prosecute the

violators. There is no place within our

legal structure for the kind of crimes

that have been committed and which

have gone unpunished.

Law Day thoughts

The Niagara Falls Bar Association celebrates Law

Day today with an observance on the thome "200 Years

of Liberty and Law.

We don't know, as this is written, what the lawyers

and their guests are going to.say.on this theme, but our

own thoughts are gium.

It is true that the nation has survived for 200 years and

so have many of the liberties of its citizens. But the

liberties promised to alf citizens by the Constitution and

the Bill of Rights are by no means secure for all citizens

at present, and we can't heip thinking the Constitution

itself is in jeopardy.

JUST THE OTHER DAY, for instance, the Senate

Intelligence Committee released

its. report on the

Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Once the Committee

had agreed to censor out such controversial data as the

CIA budget, the report was greeted with what amounted

to a yawn. Observers beliove Congress will do nothing

this year (il ever) about reform or U. S. intelligence

operations, and of

course President Ford, like his

predecessors, is quite content to keep full authority over

the CIA in his own hands.

We find this troubling. The Senate and. House Con-

mittees, and other investigations as weil, have rovealed

many instances ir which the CIA has abused the rights

of American citizens and has acted abroad in ways that

we believe are deeply inimical to American traditions.

A few days from now. the Senate Committes will

publish its report on domestic intelligence operationa. It

is already pretty well documented that the FET

ihe liberties

supposedly

guaranteed to Americans by the Constitution and the

Bill of Rights. Yer obscrvers expect there will be no

stronger impeius for reform of domestic intelligenes

• than there is for reform of the CIA.

We are frightened by this lethargy. It is true that

many of the worst abuses of the CiA and the FBi have

been discontinued. But if the institutions themsolves are

not reformed. how long will ithe before a whole new.set

of abuses

arises? if Presidents and

WHAT SEEMS TO BE at the bottom of this

congressional and presidential lethargy is an unex-

pressed contempt for the Constitution and the law.

because it is sometimes inconvenient to observe them.

One would have thought, for instance, that "executive

privilege" would have been thoroughly discredited after

ex-President Nixon's abuse of it. Yet President Ford has

been invoking it again and this pernicious doctrine -

which has neither constitutional nor legal foundation -

seems to be accepted by Congress, the President, and

even (with qualifications) by the courts. There seems to

be a consensus in Washington that the convenience of

"executive privilege" is more important than law or

Constitution.

Crminals in FBI

The FBI was originally supposed to catch criminals.

Instead, the agency spent a lot of its time in the 1960s

performing criminal acts.

The revelations that are coming from

the Senate

Intelligence Committee's investigation of the FBI's

activities in behalf of "national security" are disturbing

for two reasons: first, because they make explicit the

FBI's criminal activities which had previously been

only generally known; and second, because there is no

evidence that any agents or superior officers in the FBI

have been or will be prosecuted for these criminal acts.

er. We believe those responsible for such FBI projects as

the attempt to defame the late Rev. Martin Luther King

should be prosecuted. The attempt apparently went

beyond harrassment and snooping to active defamation

of character. Similarly, those responsible for other

criminal acts (inciting to violence in the FBI's cam-

paign against the Black Panther Party; apparently

illegal methods used in the campaign against the U.S.

Labor Party) should be prosecuted. It's bad enough that

criminal acts were apparently ordered or permitted;

what makes it even more reprehensible is that most of

them seem to have been directed against citizens who

were guilty of nothing except the "crime" of offending

the patriotic sensibilities of then FBI Director J. Edgar

Hoover and his chief assistants.

(sanatadama

diminis

• PUNISHING THE GUILTY isn't enough. Something

must be done to prevent such illegal and un-

constitutional invasion of citizens' rights in the future.

*This means, primarily, that the President and

Congress must accept more responsibility for the

conduct of the FBI and other police and intelligence

agencies. Neither party wants to do this now. It has been

convénient for Presidents and Congresses to remain

ignorant of what the FBi, the CIA, and others were up

to. Now that we all know what they were up to, we also

know that Presidents

and Congresses behaved

irresponsibly by remaining willfully ignorant.

Congress has got to set up a committee to oversee the

behavior of the FBI and the others. That will mean the

President will have to take care to keep himself better

informed and to see to it that intelligence activities are

legal and constitutional, or else face censure by

Congress,

If they don't take on this responsibility, there will

surely be more illegelity and unconstitutionality in the

inture.

Bill to Limit Federal Prying

been deluged with startling disclosures

various federal agencies have

pried into confidential records, tapped

telephones, traced mail and otherwise

rudely brushed aside personal liberties.

While the disclosures themselves have

been legion, however, new laws to pre-

vent their recurrence have not.

That absence of corrective legislation

is a major reason why the so-called Bill

of Rights Procedures Act (H.R. 214),

now working its way slowly through the

committee system of the House of Repre-

sentatives, looks so beneficial.

Another reason is that it confronts the

problem-the acknowledged need to in-

vestigate possible criminal activities

while still protecting individual liberties

-in a sensible way.

The proposal, sponsored by Rep.

Charles Mosher (R., Ohio) and co-spor-

officials and

authorization would

have to be renewed every 30 days.

We are not legislators, of course, and

H.R. 214 may not be perfect. Aiso, it does

not cover investigations for national se-

curity reasons. This is an area of grave

abuse, too, but one in which another bill,

proposed by the Ford administration and

supported by séveral Democratic leaders

in Congress, would produce reforms.

But the Mosher bill is impressive in

its concept and its objectives. It has

undergone hearings and won approval

from a key House subcommittee. We

Today marks my first áppearance before the Senate

Select Committee on Intelligence. I want to assure you that

I sincerely welcome the opportunity to work with you.

I believe that we can and must develop a clear

base of understanding between the Executive and Legislative

Branches on the proper role of the FBI in the discharge of

its complex national security responsibilities.

As the Supreme Court so aptly observed in its

Keith Decision in 1972, "Unless Government safeguards its

own capacity to function and to preserve the security of its

people, society itself could become so disordered that all

rights and liberties would be endangered. "

Yet the maintenance of national security is a

hollow victory unless it can be achieved with the least

possible intrusion into the rights and privacy of our citizens.

Balancing these imperatives will require the greatest study

and serious thought.

Together, I feel we can reach a meaningful understanding.

which will best serve our country.

Since I became Director in 1973, there has been

continuous examination of all major aspects of the FBI's

operations. One such study, initiated in 1974, established

that a quality, rather than a caseload quantity, approach in

the assignment of our manpower and other resources would

produce better results.

NW 54965 DocId: 32989503 Page 278

## Page 279

Originally, this quality approach was tried on an

experimental basis in four of our 59 field divisions. It

proved so successful that we implemented it field-wide in 1975.

Today, the quality approach is being applied to all

areas of jurisdiction, including those in the foreign

intelligence and domestic security fields that are of prime

interest to this Committee.

In July, 1973, we had 21,414 domestic security cases.

By March 31, 1976, before the Attorney General's guidelines

took effect, we had--through application of the quality

approach--reduced this caseload to 4,868 investigative matters,

a 78 percent reduction. As of September 20, 1976, this figure

has been further reduced to 626. This includes investigations

of 78 organizations and 548 individuals.

This reduction has been made possible largely because

we have discontinued investigations of rank and file members.

We are confident that the FBI can meet its responsibilities

by focusing our investigations on the activities of organ-

izations and on individuals who are in a policy-making position

in those organizations or who have engaged in activities which

indicate they are likely to use force or violence in violation

of Federal law.

In effecting this reduction, we have kept these

vital principles in mind:

- 2 -

NW 54965

DocId: 32989503 Page 279

## Page 280

First, there must be no sacrifice or compromise

of the essential security needs of the United States.

Second, there must be the least possible intrusion

on the rights and privacy of our citizens, including

their sacred right of legitimate dissent.

Third, although domestic security cases differ in

some respects from ordinary criminal investigations,

these cases should be tied as closely as possible to

actual or potential violations of Federal law. In

furtherance of this objective, last month I transferred

the supervision of all domestic security cases from our

Intelligence Division to our General Investigative

Division, which has responsibility over criminal matters.

In an effort to insure uniform adherence to the

guidelines and laws applicable to these and all other areas

of our jurisdiction, I have combined the Office of Planning

and Evaluation and the Inspection Division. In this new

Division I have created a Professional Responsibility Section.

It will report directly to me.

I have also expanded the role of the Legal Counsel

Division in reviewing all areas of FBI policies and operations.

Legal Counsel will report directly to me and to the Associate

Director.

The investigations transferred include those

involving domestic organizations oriented toward violence

and individuals affiliated with such groups, as well as civil

unrest and demonstration matters and basic revolutionary

groups dedicated to the overthrow of the Government. The

General Investigative Division will also be responsible for

several categories of criminal investigations formerly

administered by the Intelligence Division. These are

bombing matters, sabotage, passport and visa violations,

and protection of foreign officials and official guests

of the United States.

The guidelines which the Attorney General issued

last March set forth standards and procedures for domestic

security investigations. But, the FBI regards these to be

minimum standards. FBI Headquarters has imposed stringent

criteria to insure we use our manpower resources in the most

productive manner.

There are a number of reasons why we have been able

to bring about a major reduction in our domestic security

caseload.

The decade of the 1960's was marked by protests,

often violent, on our Nation's streets and campuses.

We entered the 1970s still engaged in an undeclared

conflict in Vietnam which was unpopular with some segments

of our population.

Not in recent history had this country been

so divided over an issue, and this division was not limited

to rhetoric but included demonstrations that often erupted

into violence.

There were deliberate criminal acts, including

bombings and sabotage, by persons

opposed to our involvement

in Vietnam. The role of the FBI in this confrontation was

clearly to thwart the efforts of those who resorted to

violence as an expression of their opposition.

With the cessation of the Vietnam War in early 1973,

a major cause for divisiveness in this country was eliminated, and

the potential for violence was lessened, but not eliminated.

The FBI began closing thousands of investigations

at that time as determinations

were made that certain groups

and individuals no longer were engaged in activities that

were likely to involve violations of Federal law.

The FBI met the unusual challenges of the 1960s and

early 1970s. The Senate Select Committee has examined these

and other problems in the intelligence field which led

- 5 -

## Page 283

to the creation of this Oversight Committee; and as the

Committee is aware, the FBI fully cooperated in that review.

You have my absolute assurance that your Committee

will receive the same full cooperation in carrying out its

responsibilities under Senate Resolution 400.

One of the tasks confronting this Committee is the

formulation of a legislative charter defining the FBI's

jurisdiction in the domestic security and intelligence fields.

This will be a most precise and demanding undertaking.

As I remarked to Senator Church's Committee, the

legislative charter must be sufficiently flexible that it does

not stifle the FBI's effectiveness in combating the high

incidence of crime and violence across the United States.

The charter must clearly address the demonstrated problems

of the past; yet, it must amply recognize the fact that times

change and so also do the nature and thrust of our criminal

and subversive challenges.

The fact that the Department of Justice has

undertaken the formulation of operational guidelines governing

this area of our activities does not in any manner diminish

the need for legislation. The responsibility for conferring

jurisdiction resides with the Congress.
