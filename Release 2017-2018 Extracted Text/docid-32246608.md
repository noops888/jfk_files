In regard to the allegation that Lee Harvey Oswald was

federal agents from the Customs House Building." (pp. 11, 12)

De Bruyes was among this group. (pp. 12, 17) Pena refused

to say whether he ever observed Oswald and de Brueys speaking

together. (pp. 12, 13) He believes the two knew each other

Summary of Deposition of Orest Pena

Page 2

Pena contends that there is a connection between the

Kennedy assassination and Cuban training camps in New Orleans.

(pp. 14, 15, 28, 33)

Pena did not testify on all relevant issues before

the Warren Commission, because de Brueys had threatened

Pena told a number of people, including Mark Lane

and Harold Weisberg, that Oswald was an FBI informant. (pp. 20, 21)

i had includea tene

a State Department list (Warren Commission
