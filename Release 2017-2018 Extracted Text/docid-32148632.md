State Department advises that Commission

Request to declassily

Legal Attache Mexico City's 5-18

"Secret" summary memorandum is not

likely to cause harmful repercussions between Mexico and U. S. and

it has no objection to declassification. This recommends that we

prepare a sanitized unclassified version of the summary for delivery

to the Commission,

meet its needs-*Ju rocedure which the Commission now states will

The Commission on 9-22 asked us to declassify the "Secret"

181-page 5-18-64 summary prepared by Legal Attache Mexico City.

The principal reason for classification of the summary was to avoid

o;

disclosure of active investigation in Mexico by Bureau personnel, a

factor the Mexicans strongly opposed and to protect highly sensitive

security informants Mex 18 and 19/who provided some of- thendata 2l

•in the document.

Because of possible international regercusSions

¿ between Mexico and U. S. if the summary was made public,

we ön 9-23

sought the views of the State Department.

State's 9-22, written repLy

expresses view that declassification is not likely to cause

• harmful

repercussions between Mexico and

S. and, accordingly, Wit interposes

no objection to declassification

(4)

Legal Attache, Mexico City, is opposed to declassification

of 'the document in its present form and suggests that, if possible,

a sanitized version be prepared by deleting

three nonsubstantive items?

which are not referred to in the Commission's report and by deleting

references to sources of information through

Memorandum to Mr. Sullivan.

Re:

'105-82555

CONFSENTIAD

The summary can readily be amended to suit the Commission's

needs and at the same time to protectlex l8 and i9kand to avoid

disclosure of the extent of our investigation in Mexico. This can

be accomplished by deleting reference to three items which are not.

touched upon in the Commission's report and by rewriting an introduction

paragraph on page one deleting a specific reference to a confidential

source abroad (Legat). The Commission's report on page 304 records

that". . . the Government of Mexico initiated a thorough investigation

to uncover as much information as possible on Oswald's trip.

Representatives of U. S. agencies worked in close liaison with

Mexican law enforcement authorities." A slight revision of

Introductory paragraph on page

one will accurately fit the above

statement of the commission (4)

RECOMMENDATION

It is recommended that to properly protect our operations

in Mexico, the 5-18 summary be written in unclassified form as

aforesaid. To do this will not require complete retyping.

propose to amend principally by deleting five to six pages

We

and to

reproduce the document by Xerox and to renumber the pages!
