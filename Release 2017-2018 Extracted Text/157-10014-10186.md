Personal Files

From: Paul Wallach

Date: September 5, 1975

Re: CIA Mail Watch List

INVENTORIED

iN 3/21/77

BY BC

On Friday, August 29, 1975, Messrs. Wallach, Dick

and Bushong travelled to Langley to review the Watch List

and letters purloined during the New York mail intercapt operation.

At Langley, we met with

and

- who is now singularly assigned to the vault to handle

FOIA requests - stayed with us for the three hours we were there.

He also - with color -- briefed us as to the nature of the docu-

ments, the retrieval processes and history of the project.

We reviewed the personal files of an "analyst" that

Jim Dick uncovered.

We also reviewed the current Watch List,

randomly sampled the persons whose mail was opened (approximately

80% of mail opened was to or from persons not on Watch List),

and

selectively reviewed certain months take. In this regard,

Jim looked at the months immediately preceding the December

1971 memorandum covering elected or appointed official's mail.

Jim and Tom Dawson

had previously reviewed the Watch

Lists and taken down selected names. I copied down the list

of names, etc., attached hereto.
