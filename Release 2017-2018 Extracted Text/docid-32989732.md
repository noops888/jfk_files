Attention: Mr. Robert I. Keuch

Deputy Assistant Attorney General

Criminal Division, Room 2113

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

that staff be provided access to the "informant files of all

• By a letter dated April 12, 1974331435

, the Committee requested

informants within the Invaders during 1968 .

•".

It is now requested that the Memphis Field Office files

for these same informants be prepared for access by the staff.

While the Connittee feels that the procedure by which

was permitted access to the first set of files was unacceptable'/

and contrary to the Memorandum of Understanding, pending future

discussions to arrange to broaden access, this procedure may

again be utilized.

It is my understanding that these files will be sanitized

only to the extent necessary to protect the identity of the

informants.

Again, the Committee reservesthe right to request the

production of the identity of the informants involved if such

is deemed necessary to complete our.

As time is extremely crue tEl avestigation.

62-17210-7768

I in this matter, your

attention in seeing that these files are prepared

on a priority

is greatly appreciated.

This teletype confirms telephonic contact with Jackson

Referenced teletype concerns information provided by these

informants regarding the whereabouts of White Hate subjects

Deavours Nix and Samuel Bowers at the approximate time of King's

assassination.

If informants are located and refuse HSCA interview, the

Committee will be advised.

It intormants agree to interview,

having them initiate contact with the HSCA is the best method of

handling this situation because we can avoid furnishing the HSCA

Illinois, at RAY's request since he left his employment

prior to receipt of the check, stating that he was going to

Both of the KLINGEMANs characterized JAMES EARL

RAY as an excellent employee, quiet, attentive, prompt,

friends or visitors

during the time of his

employment.

They did recall that during the subject's

believe that they would recognize this person's voice if they

heard it again.

In conversation with Mr. HUIE, the KLINGEMANS

received the following information on a

confidential basis and

advised that they were rather reluctant to divulge it,

but felt that it was their duty as citizens.

that this information bemintained on a confidential basis within

don beat nuat ned

They requasted

the FBI.

They advised that they contacted Chief DERNING

because of his reputation and are now following his advice in

furnishing this information to the FBI:

Mr. HUIE towed the KLINGEMANs letters from RAY in

which RAY listed

employment at the Indian Trail Restaurant.

(It should be noted that this restaurant is an old, large,

upper class restaurant, of excellent reputation. Chief

DARNING advised that the KLINGEMANs themselves have an

excellent reputation within the community and that he holds

them in very high regard). HUlE told them that RAY had

served seven years of a twenty-year sentence at Jefferson,

Missouri, prison, during which time he had eight visitors,

one of whom was his brother, however, HUIE did not identify

which one. Prior to his escape, RAY had stashed away

a razor, green prison trousers which had been dyed black, and

12 hersey bars in anticipation that he would have to go

without food for some time.

RAY

also had $300 in his shoe.

He escaped in abed truck and walked to Chicago, Illinois,

crom Jefferson City, Missouri, which took him about eight

days.

(The KLINGEMÁNs do recall that when the subject first

appered at the restaurant, his feet were swollen and that

their sister-in-law gave him two Ace bandages to use which he

mentioned in the letter in HUIt'

returned three or four days lates possessionposedly was

Thereafter, RAY read the advertisement in the

Tribune wherein the KLINGEMANs had advertised for help in the

restaurant.

HUIE said that the subject in the letter

. CE

mentioned that the employment at the Indian Trail Restaurant

was the "high point of his life".

HUTE mentioned that RAY had had only three jobs

in his life, one of which was in a shoe factory outside of

East St. Louis, Illincis, which is prior to his going to

prison the last time.

He also said that during the time RAY

was employed at the restaurant, he was "tapped on the shoulder!'

by an individual who recognized him and who threatened to

reveal his identity to the police and cause RAY's return to

Prison if he, RAY, did not work for this person. HUlE said

that RAY was

given $1,200 during the initial contacts, by: the

alieged conspirators, and was ultimately paid $15,000, but

was due to receive more.

Again, according to HUIE, RAY was told to go to

Canada to investigate the difficulty of crossing the border.

Supposedly RAY made two trips through the Detroit Tunnel into

Janada. He also made a third trip to Canada, date and

sed newspaper, vet, and "was instructed to obtain a 40-year-

and search the current phone directory for similar names.

He was then to surveil the individuals with similar names to

determine whether or not. his physical description was

similar to theirs.

Thereafter, he telephoned persons of his

like description,

utilizing a pretext, and thereby found a man

who had never applied for a passport. RAY then applied for a

passport in this name.

The KLINGEMANs advised that they were not sure that

they were furnishing this information in its proper

sequence, but that to the best of their recollection, the

drove through Mexico to the West Coast and hid out there to

receive further instructions from the other individuals in

the alleged conspiracy. HUIE stated that RAY was flown to

Atlanta from the West Coast, but the time was not right, there

was no action andle was sent back to California.

He was also

told to be in Mississippi at a certain time and place.

Supposedly Reverend MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. was at a Holiday

Inn Motel in Atlanta, Georgia, when RAY was flown there.

Subsequently, RAY was given money to obtain binoculars

and a shotgun and was to go to Memphis to be somewhere at

3 p.m. in room 312 or 313.

Supposedly there were other

individuals who also came to this room and there was a

Negro male who purportedly called KING out to the balcony.

According to HUIE, the actual murderer of KING was not RAY,

although RAY was present and at a later time (probably the trial)

RAY will identify the murderer. RAY did pick up the rifle, ran

to his car, and sped to a rendezvous in Atlanta, Georgia.

He was supposed to pick up a "bundle of money"

however,

conspirators did not appear.

RAY allegedly spent several days

or hours at this apartment in Atlanta, Georgia, awaiting the

arrival of his "fellow conspirators"

According to HUIE, the plan was for RAY to go to

Mexico, but immediately fly north to throw off pursuit and

to steer all investigation to Mexico. However,

since

the conspirators did not appear in Atlanta, RAY fled to Calada

thereafter utilizing his knowledge to obtain a passport and

fled to England.

The KLINGEMANs advised that the rest of HUIE's story

substantially follows the newspaper accounts which appeared

after subject RAY's arrest in England. They did note that

HUle stated that RAY did rob a bank in London because he

"got real low on money"

HUrE at no time identified the

alleged fellow conspirators of RAY. He did swear the KLINGEMANS

to secrecy and told

them that he would mail the "Look"

a do that he no mate the e rot available to

Both Mr. and Mrs.

te interviewing Agents for review.

The KLINGMANs advised that RAY began working for

them as a dishwasher and because of his excellent attitude

was advanced to cook's helper. During the time he was in

their employ, they did not observe him in a car, nor did they

know him to own an automobile. He had no visitors, he did

not wear glasses, he had no women friends, nor did he make

any advances toward the female personnel employed at the

restaurang and they noted that his hair was "less bushy" during

the time he was at the restaurant than shown in the

photographs.

They are not, sure how he came to work from his

apartment, but believe hemight have beenimet at the Eden's

Expressway by WILLIE PERRY and FRED BURNS, who wera also

employees at the restaurant.

His conduct was excellent and they cannot recall

him making any comments one way or another about members of

the Negro race and specifically no comments whatsoever con-

cerning MARLIN LUTHER KING, JR, RAY made no reference to his

previous employent, but did mention that he was in

Brimerhaven, Germany, during World War II. They advised that

when RAY received the phone calls during his last week of

employment he seened to be disturbed and that his

concentration on his work was not as good as it usually was..

They then recalled that according to HUIE, that when

JAMES EARE. RAY left England, he was going to Lisbon

to get to

They again stated that the information furnished to them by

HUIE came from letters which RAY had written to his attorney, who

in turn turned them over to the author.

Also Mr. KLINGEMAN

stated that in one of the letters which he believed was to

the attorney from RAx, while he was in London, Ingland, there

was a drawing identifying a location which appeared to

Diversey Street and Sheffield Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.

At the conclusion of the interview, the Klingemans

again requested that this information be maintained in

confidence and expressed a willingness to co-operate with

the FBI in ay way possible.
