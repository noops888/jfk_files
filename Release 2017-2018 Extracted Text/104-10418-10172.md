SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

This responds in full to a December 18,

1978, letter to the Attorney General signed by G. Robert

Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director, HSCA, which asked

that the FBI declassify,

in toto,

a Secret, September 14,

1978, response made to 16

interrogatories

pertaining to

Ivanovich Nosenko which were propounded by the

Committee in its letter of September 5, 1978.

Declassification of the September 14, 1978,

response required coordination with the Office

of Legis-

lative Counsel, CIA, which

interposed no objection to

declassifying certain portions of that response.

The Committee's attention is invited to the

fact that CIA did suggest, with regard to the response

to interrogatory number

"g", that the FBI "... may wish

to correct the dates on which the FBI did not have direct

to MI. Nosenko, to read 3 April 1961 until 8 December

For the convenience of the Committee,

This responds in full to the following enumerated

interrogatories submitted for consideration in a letter,

dated Soptember 5, 1978

to the Attorney General and signod

by: G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director, ESCA.

"I. On what dates and for how long was Nosenko

questioned or the FBI about Lee Harvey Oswald-

from 1964 to present?"

The files of the FBI indicate that Yuri Ivanovich

Nosenko was interviewed regarding Oswald and/oï the assassi-

nation of President John F. Kennedy on February 26 and 27,

1904, and on Maich 3, 4 and 6, 1264.

The FBI files do not

record the specific duration in whole or in part as to

topical discussions, of those five interviews; hovever,

summary communications indicate the February 27, 1964 inter

view was conducted on the afternoon of that date

and the

MarCh 4,

1964 discussion of Oswald occurred at the outset

of an aftornoon interview on that date.

#2. When Nosenko was questioned by the FBI about

Lee Harvey Oswald; who did the questioning?"

The FBI interviews of Nosenko, during which he was

questioned about Oswald and/or the assassination of President

Kennedy, were conducted by Special Agents (SAs) Alekso

Poptanich, Maurice A. Taylor and Donald E. Walter on

February 20 and 27, 1964; by

Poptanich and W. Marvin

Gheesling on March 3 and 4, 1964; and by SAs Poptanich,

Taylor and Walter on March 6, 1964.

"3. What background, if any, did the interro

gator have in interrogations? What knowledge

did the interrogator have with respect to Oswald's

background?"

There are no retrievable FBI statistics upon which

to base a quantification of the interrogatory experiences of

the SA personnel who interviewed Nosenko on the five pertinent

occasions.

Suffice it to say, the techniques of cooperative

and hostile interrogations are integral aspects of the

and almost daily

duties of SA personnel.

training

In that regard,

is noted that during the February and March, 1964

SA Poptanich had almost 13 years of SA experience; SA Taylor

had over 31 years of SA experience; SA Walter had completed

almost 17 years of SA experience; and SA Gheesling had over

13 years of SA experience.

Further, their respective personnel

files disclose the following:

SA Poptanich was then fluent in the Russian language

(Nosenko's native tongue).

The Annual Report of Performance

Rating,

dated March 31, 1962, noted that SA Poptanich, during

the previous twelve months, had

participated in the interro-

gation of a Soviet defector and his knowledge of the Russian

language and mores of the Russian people proved most helpful

rolative thereto.

Special Agent in Chaige (SAC) of the Washington Fieli Office,

in submitting a recommendation for the incentive award,

commented that SA Taylor had demonstrated exceptional ability

in the interrogation and debriefing of three Soviet defectors,

all

of whom were intelligence officers.

SA Haltor was the recipient of a personal letter of

commendation, dated October 3, 1963, from

the Director,

for his superior work in the handling of a very sensitive,

espionage

case, successful interrogation being the key aspect of that

investigation.

SA Gheesling, at the time of the pertinent Nosenko

interviews, served

a Supervisor at FBI Headquarters and

had considerable experience in espionage, intell: gence and

counterintelligence investigations.

SA

Gheesling supervised

the field investigation of Oswald (from the latter's return to

the United States on June 13, 1962 until September, 1962,

and

from November 22, 1963 through mid-1964).

He was assigned

exclusively to supervisory

responsibilities iclative to the

assassination of President Konnedy.

While the specific knowledge of Oswald's background,

possessed by thesa SAs at the time of the Nosenko interviews,

can be answered only by the SAs themselves,

Gheesling's

prior assignment to supervision of the Oswald investigation

would tend to indicate that he,

at least, was quite knowlerge-

able of data contained in FBI files concerning Oswald.

"4. On the dates that Nosenko was questioned about

Oswald, does there now exist or did there ever exist:

a. a tape of the questions asked and Noserko's

answers,

bo a transcript of the questions asked and

Nosenko's answers;

c. a summary of the questions asked arid.

Nosenko's enswers?".

ol verbatim transcripts of FBl interviews

with Nosenko that

concerned Oswald and or the assassination

of President Kennedy.

A docent has been located which indicates

that FBI personncl

did record the February 26 and 27, 1964, interviews

of Nosenko,

among others.

Since no recordings or transcripts have been

located, it can be assumed that the recordings were used by

the interviewing SAs to check the accuracy of their notes

prior to dictating the results of the intorviews. It is

further assumed that, upon verifying the accuracy of

reportings of the interviews, the recordings were disposed of

since they had served the purpose for which they were made,

although no record of such disposition can be found.

Summaty

reportings of the five portinent interviews are extant, and

were delivered to the HSCA on March 21, 1973.

"5. What criteria, if any, was used to determine:

3. What subjects to question Nosenko about;

b. how much time to devote to each subject!"

FBI files do not contain a specific

enumeration of

criteria used to determine the particular subjects Nosenko

was to be questioned about nor the amount of time to be devoted

to each subject in the questioning.

"6. What significance - with respect to possible

foreign involvement in the assassination as well

as to the issue of Nosenko's bonafides (sic) did

the FBI attach during the years 1964-1968 to Nosenko's

statements about Oswald?"

The FBI, during the years 1964-1968, considered

Nosenko's

statements about Oswald to be very significant elements

of his initial reportings, the veracity of which nad to be

assessed in relation to the totality of infoimation furnished

by him.

The FBI perceived Nosenko's statements

about Oswald;

depending upon à subsequent, definitive resolution of Nosenko's

bona fides, to be the most authoritative information available

indicative

of a lack of Soviet governmental involvement in the

assassination of President Kennedy.

(HISCA)

"7. What signiticance - with respect to possible

foreign involvement in the essassination as well as

to the issue of Nosenko's bonafides (sic) - does

the FBI attach today to Nosenko's statements about

Oswald?"

The FBI does not perceive any significant evidence of

foreign involvement in

the assassination of President Kennedy,

nor does the FBI perceive any credible evidence that Nosenko's

defection was a Soviet ploy to mask Soviet goverrmental

involvement in the assassination.

Therefore, the FBI is

satisfied that Nosenko reported the facts about Oswald as he

knew then.

"8. If the answer to question 6 is äifferent from

the response to question 7, when did the change

occur and why?"

The FBI had no direct accoss to Nosenko from

April 3, 1964 until April 3,

1959, and therefore was not in

a position to make an objective assessment of his bona fides

nor of the veracity of information furnished by him.

information provided by him, in early 1904, was accepted st

face value and qualified in terms of

the source and the

conditions under which it was reccived.

On October 1, 1968,

the FBI advised the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)

that,

based upon a review of material provided by CIA, the FBI

found no substantial basis to conclude that Nosenko was not

a bona fide defector; however, the FBI did not reach

any

overall, definitive conclusions regarding his bona fides

because of a lack of access to Nosenko and all collateral

information pertinent to such an assessment.

Effective

May 11, 1977, the CIA and FBI concurred that Nosenko was a

bona fide defector, based upon an assessment of the

totality of information furnished

by him.

he made to the FBI about Oswald.

The statenents were accopted

As indicated in the responses to questions

7 and 8,

the FBI, as of October 1, 1968,

found no substantial basis to

conclude Nosenko was not

a bona fide defector; as of May l1,

1977, accepted a CIA assessment that Nosenko was a bona fide

"15. Did either the FBI or the CIA have primary

responsibility for investigating Nosenko's state

ments about Oswald? If neither had primary

responsibility, was there any division of

responsibility?"

The FBI had primary responsibility for investigating

Nosenko's statements about Oswald that pertained to his

(Oswald's) activities in the United States,

including the

assassination of President Kennedy.

The CIA had primary

responsibility.for investigating Nosenko's statements about

Oswald's activities abroad.

"16. What communication, if any, existed between

the FBI and CIA with respect to evaluating and/or

investigating Nosenko's statements about Oswald?"

The FBI forwarded a letter, dated March ó, 1964,

from

the Director, FBI, to the Director, CIA, enclosing

memoranda dated February 28, 1964, and

March 4, 1964, cap-

tioned "Lee Harvey Oswald,"

which

summarized the results of

FBI interviews of. Nosenko regarding Oswald on February 26

and 27, 1964, and March 3 and 4, 1964.

The results of a CIA

interview of Nosenko on January 23, 1964, regarding Oswald

were furnished to the FBI in a letter from

the CIA dated

April 28, 1954.

These particular pieces of correspondence,

while not setting forth any specific requests or investiga-

tive leads, were furnished for purposes of evaluation.
