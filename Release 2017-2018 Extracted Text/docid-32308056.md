ascertain

: to

NONE:

This matter relates to recent charges by Hoffa, which

appeared in news media to the effect that the Teamsters are having

difficulty in complying with the law as it relates to bonding

of union officials.

According to these articles, the surety

company handling the master bond of the Teamsters has cancelled

it, effective 2/8/63, and numerous bonding companies contacted

by the Teamsters have refused to handle the bonding.

Hoffa

claims this is due to pressures exerted on these firms by the

Justice Department and Department of Labor.

According to information received from the Criminal

Division on 1/31/63,

the House Committee on Labor and Education

(Representative Adam Clayton Powell, D-N.V., Chairman) intends

to hold a hearing today in executive

session,

Deputy Attorney

General Katzenbach intends to appear at this hearing and categori-

cally deny Hoffa's charges. It was previously reported that Hoffa

would appear in person; however, it has now been learned that he

will be represented by counsel.

It is noted that the Bureau, at the

request of the

Criminal Division, has been conducting extensive inquiries into

allegations that Hoffa, through Allen M. Dorfman (a close friend

of Hoffa's) has received kickbacks in connection with various

insurance programs of the Teamsters Union.

We have now dis-

continued these investigations on

advice received from the

Criminal Division.

The confidential source mentioned herein is NY 2305-C

a New York Teamster official and associate of

Hoffa's).
