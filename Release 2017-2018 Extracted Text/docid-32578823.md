Finances

New. York sources report that BATISTA contributes

very little money to the MDC and most of the contributions

come from Cubans, Americans and from Venezuela and New York.

Miami sources claim that the MDC has little or no money.

BATISTA is an extremely rich individual and spends his own

money on military operations.

Miami sources state that

BATISTA is unopposed as the military leader of the organi-

zation- because he buys all the military equipment needed.

On interview BATISTA has advised in the past

that the equipment used when he goes on a mission is his

own personal equipment and does not belong to the organization.

"Sigma 10"

Coast Guard and British authorities. However, BATISTA

eluded the U. S. Coast Guard and the British frigate

"Londonderry"

BATISTA even flew on a commercial airplane

from an out island in the Bahamas to Nassau, bought motor

parts,

returned to the out island, made repairs on the

"Sigma 10"

"Sigma l0.' and then returned to the United States.

The

on this trip traveled over 1000 miles in the

Bahamas through waters

patrolled daily by the U. S. Coast

Guard air and surface craft.

It is noted that the CIA recently advised that the

MDC met with the DIRECTORIO REVOLUCIONARIO ESTUDIANTIL (DRE)

and made an oral pact concerning unity in infiltration and

guerrilla activity in Cubal

*on 3-18-64, MM 635-9fadVised that the DRE operates

from Samana Key, Bahamas...

The U.S. Coast Guard was immediately

notified and sent a plane over this

island and noted that the

island contained numerous caves and cliffs that could hide

small boats. The Coast Guard said there were about a dozen
