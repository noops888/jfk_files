The Bureau's attention was called to New York letter,

10/29/62, where the NYO advised that a letter was anonymously

mailed by the NYO to MARVIN MARKMAN on 10/25/62, which pointed

out to MARKMAN substantially what MARKMAN is now complaining

about. The NYO believes that its letter set the seeds of thought

in MARKMAN's mind and these thoughts have now come out into

open dissatisfaction on the part of MARKMAN.

wy Elza's advised that there is to bad dinner in April

or May, 1964, to raise funds for L'Unita. NY 2124 will play a

key role in the planning and administering of the dinner which

is the main fund-raising affair of the year.

(5)

Among other duties, NY 2124-S prepares and sends out

part of the hndreds a invitations to this affair. Nyl? houst

said that invitations are sent to people out of town, even

it is known that they will not attend, but they do send in a

contribution.

From the NYO's knowledge of past events, the NYO believes

that NY 2124S would be in the position to discreetly frustrate

of town were never mailed, that source or income would be cut off

If they do not receive the invitation, the persons would never

know that they had been invited. He will also fail to mail

invitations to persons who are not very active throughout the year,

again cutting down the contributions and attendance at the affair.

The Bureau by letter, 3/11/64, has approved this

plan of the NYO.

At recent meetings of the Nat Richman Club of the

Bronx CP, attempts were made by club leaders to discuss Viet Nam,

Cyprus, Africa and the Soviet-Chinese dispute.

At that last club meeting, the informant made a strong

protest that such discussions were a waste of time since the

club could do little about such problems.

He pointed out that

there are many local problems right in Bronx County which the

club members could help solve, problems such as discrimination,

housing, education, etc., which deserve immediate attention.

The informant's remarks caused considerable argument

and confusion, resulting in complete disruption of the meeting.
