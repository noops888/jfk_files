1 ELIORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Conversation with Manuel Artime and

Manolin Hernandez • 1 April 1963

The evening of 1 April 1963 I received a telephone

call from Artine saying that he was in town and desired to

felicitate my wife on the occasion of her birthday.

course, invited him to come to my home and he arrived in due

course with Manolin Hermandez, his one-time sepusy in the MR.

Artime said that he had just returned from a long trip

Chrough the countries of Central America, that he was bringing

a message from Luis Somoza for Attorney General. Robert Kennedy,

an appointment to see the latter on 2 April. Artime

said also that he was scheduled to appear on a nation wide

Television Program on the moming of

4 April from New York City

the "Today" show, I believe - and after he had seen the Attomew

General he was leaving for New York to prepare for the program.

He remarked appreciatively that he had been gratified

to find his barracks bay intact and said that he was wearing

the shoes that he had put into the barracks bag when he last

packed it in my operational quarters in Coconut Grove. The fact:

that he had been able to regain his possessions fron us after

his long imprisonment impressed Artime with the thoughtfulness

and Irtegrity of the bags' custodians.

Referring to the just-announced capture of 17 raiders

at Norman Cay, Artime indicated that he was not particularly

exercised over them as individuals,

but hoped the U.S. would

not be tricked into the posicion of being inat Castro

dasdelsed as he teles restricted to the dade county area,

our only mutual acquaintance was Pedro Diaz Lanz whom we

agreed had for some time been so uncontrollable as to raise

serious doubt's as to his mental stability.

for his part,

Artime said, he hoped that he would not be served with a

restriction notice since, if he was, he would depart the

U.S. permanently with an

atcendant blast of publicity®

I asked about Jose Perez San Roman and learned from

Artime that Pepe had suffered a mental breakdown,

that the

Robert Kennedus had rented a home for Pene:

his

wife and two

children in the McLean area and that Artime had been with

them during the day when Mrs. Kennedy had coge to the San Roman

home and seen Artime.

that the San Roman

children were driven to and from school by the Kennedys. (It

ums out that the Kennedy children, my three children.

and

Pepe's two all attend the sace parochial school on MacArthur

Blvdo, so it is not unlikely that ?epe's children will seek

mine

out as the only sther Spanish-speaking children in the

school.)

When I asked Artime what had brought about San Roman's

breakdown w he indicated that it was the result of conflicts

arising from marital unhappiness and pressures on him by the U.S.

Govt. to persuade the Brigace to enlist in the U.S. Arny. San

Roman apparently feels in recrospect that he should have

evacuated the Brigade from the beachhead rather than sacrificing

Artime said that San Roman was somewhat resentful over

the fact that his psychiatric hill was being paid by Miro Cardona,

regarding _it a way of making him indebted to Miro.

(In the

context, I judged that Pepe viewed Miro as a symbol of the CRC.)

Artime also said that he had seen Ydigoras Fuentes and

Roberto Alejos in Guatemala and he suggested that Peralta's

coup had been amicably arranged with digoras.

I inferred

that Artime had also seen Peralta on his just-completed trip.

•Manolin Hernandez asked me about a certain "Col. Earl

(Brernan" who, he said, was living or had lived at the Sheraton-

"Park Hocel and who was noving through the Cuban exile community

looking for dark-skinned Cubans to be used in Haiti against

ccording to Hernandez,

Brennan asserts that his

activity is backed by the White House, his link being via

Ambassador david Bruce.

Brennan's cone-on apparently, is

to tell former Brigade members that if they held overthrow

Haiti will be at their disposal for whatever

action they care to take against castro.

In answer to their question, I said that I had not

known Brennan in OSS in his self-described role, although

Hernandez commented that since the first of the year

he had been queried by both Jose Miro Cardona and Jose Ignacio

Rasco (MUC) ás to whether I ("Eduardo") was still in the U.S.

and had denied any knowledge of my whereabouts.

By this time it was 2 o'clock in the moming, the

three of us had downed a fifth of Scotch and we regrouned in

the kitchen where I prepared breakfast for all.
