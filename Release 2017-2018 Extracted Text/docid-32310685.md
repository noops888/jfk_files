made overtures to VINCENT JAMES PALMISANO over the past weekend

he (GRAY) had been approached by an individual in Miami who

inquired whether he (GRAY) would have the necessary connection

to handle 24 million dollars in street name securities which

had been stölen in NYC about 3 or 4 months ago. GRAY stated

that he felt that through this individual in Miami, they would

be able to set up a situation in which arrest could be had, and

the recovery of these securities could be made.

GRAY was advised

by Supervisor NEHRBASS that the FBI could not enter into an

informant relation.n1p with GRAY because of his past activitles.
