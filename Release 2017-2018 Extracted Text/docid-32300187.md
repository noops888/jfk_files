of the French Foreign Legion, CIA, the Canadian Army, and

the U. S. Army, and described as being of light complexion,

thin, muscular, with blond hair. (SU)

sibly be GERALD PATRICK

adventurer, mercenary, and soldier of fortune. He has re-

ceived considerable press publicity, and has been described

by the press as a combination of one of the Three Muskateers

and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.

town Miami wearing an Australian campaign cap and

a Van

HEMMING was a control tower operator in the U.S.

Marine Corps, and was honorably discharged. In 1959, he

went to Cuba and

was in the Cuban Revolutionary Air Force

for a short period of time.

He came to Miami from Califor-

nia in about May, 1961, and formed the Anti-Communist

Legionnaires, later known as Intercontinental Penetration

Forces, an anti-CASTRO organization.

During 1961-62, HEMMING operated military training

camps in Florida

for Cubans; staged parachute demonstra-,

tions and hunger strikes.

His

group of adventurers. and

mercenaries have been arrested by the local police for

vagrancy, armed robbery, 'and other criminal acts.

HEMMING

was arrested by U. S. Customs on several occasions for con-

spiracy to illegally export arms.

HEMMING's grOup is now

inactive; he has no followers; and, he presently works in a

bar as a

bouncer.

HEMMING maintains contact with Cuban revolutionaries

and tries to make money by selling arms and automatic weapons.

HEMMING was never associated with CIA or the Canadian Army,

and has never been accepted by responsible Cuban exile poli-

tical and military leaders.

HEMMING has wide contact among

American adventurers and mercenaries, arms dealers and

smugglers, and it would be logical when such types come to

Miami, they make contact with HEMMING.

The above information is

for the benefit of the

Savannah and San Francisco Offices:

MM 639-S advised he has never heard of captioned

subject and can furnish no information concerning him.
