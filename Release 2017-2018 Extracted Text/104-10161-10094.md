1, NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE OF 1 MARCH HAS BLOWN THE LID OFF

THE SITUAT 10N HERE ONCE AGAIN. SPANISH TRANSLATION OF WHAT

APPEARS TO BE FULL ARTICLE HAS TWO QUOTES BY DAVID PHILLIPS TIED

TO "SOURCES OF INTELLIGENGE" AND "AN OLD OFFICIAL OF THE CIA" IN

SUCH A MANNER THAT ON QUICK REING IT APPEARS ALL IS ATTRIBUTABLE

TO DAVID PHILLIPS, THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE GOVERNMENT OF

•VENEZUELA DID. NET BURDEN OF THIS SECTION IS THAT WHILE DAVID

• PHILLIPS WOULD SWEAR CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ AND LUIS ECHEVERRIA

ALVAREZ NEVER RECEIVED ANY PERSONAL BRIBES, THE USG GAVE THE

TESTIMONY OF AN EX-AGENT OF THE CIA WHO SAYS HE SERVED IN VENEZUELA

WHEN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ WAS MINISTER OF INTERIOR". "FINALLY,

WE REJECT THE POSSIBLITY THAT THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS ( PLURALS

POINT SPEAKING ONLY FOR HIMSELF AND NOT THE PRESIDENT, SUGGESTED

THAT THE CIA DISAVOW PHILLIPS' STATEMENT.. DOM TOLD FORMIN -THAT

CIA HAS NO CAPABILITY FOR THIS SORT OF THING AND FOR

SOME TIME HAS BEEN UNDER STRICT INJUNCTION NOT TO TALK TO PRESS.

ESCOVAR THEN SUGGESTED THAT USG AT SOME OTHER

LEVEL REFUTE LATEST

NYT" DEFAMATION", PERHAPS THROUGH THE CARACAS EMBASSY, DOM REPLIED

THAT OF COURSE HE HAD NO AUTHORITY TO ACT ON ANYTHING LIKE THI'S

BUT WOULD REFER IDEA TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT FOR CONSIDERATION.

ESCOVAR SAID WHOLE SUBJECT WAS

PAINFUL TO PRESIDENT • THAT IT WOULD

BE USED AGAINST THE AD PARTY BY THE OPPOSITION IN THE FORTHCOMING

ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN, AND THE GOV WANTED TO LET IT DIE: WAS THERE

• NOT SOME WAY THAT THE USG COULD RESTRAIN EX-INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS

AND THE NEW YORK: TIMES FROM REOPENING THE WOUND. THE

AGAINST THE CIA AND THE PRESS ATTACKS ON PRESIDENT PEREZ.

DEMONSTRATION WILL BE FROM CATIA SUBURB OF CARACAS TO PLAZA

O'LEARY IN EL SILENCIO SECTION AND OTHER POLITICAL PARTIES_WILL

BE INVITED TO JOIN IN. GUERVARA, WHO IS MEMBER OF JAIME LUSINCHIIS

PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE (LUSINCHI IS GENERALLY BELIEVED TO

BE CAP'S CHOICE FOR HIS SUCCESSORS, SAID THAT •

PEOPLE FROM THE INTERIOR OF VENEZUELA HAVE ALSO EXPRESSED THEIR

• DESIRE TO JOIN IN THIS DEMONSTRATION. NOTE THAT AREA CHOSEN

FOR DEMONSTRATION IS • PROBABLY BY DESIGN, FAR REMOVED FROM EMBASSY

AND OTHER U.S, INSTALLATIONS IN CARACAS AND SHOULD NOT INVOLVE

THEM UNLESS HOTHEADS TAKE OVER AND TRY SOMETHING ON THEIR OWN.I

5. ALL OF FOREGOING TENDS TO REACTIVATE DANGEROUS SITUATION

OF 22 FEBRUARY, ALTHUUGH SO FAR THIS PHASE DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE

AS MUCH STEAM •IN IT AS WHEN CRISIS FIRST DEVELOPED. AS IS NOW

WELL-ESTABLISHED, CAP IS: MOST SENSITIVE BORDERING ON PARANOIC

IF THERE IS FURTHER PROVOCATION, WE CAN PRETTY WELL GUARANTEE THAT

HE WILL REACT STRONGLY, QUITE POSSIBLY STRIKING BACK AT
