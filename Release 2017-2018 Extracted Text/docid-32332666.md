SEBASTI

JOFIN LA ROCCA, aka

AR

(00: PITTSBURGH)

The following is technical information for review by

the sound trained agents assigned your Division.

In a letter dated 2/10/65 in captioned matter, you

furnished line information of the telephone service for captioned

individual's hone, and inquired whether or not the (Radio-Irequency

Microphone-Telephone (RFUT) or the Zener Activated Microphone (ZAI))

techniques could be used to effect MISUR coverage:

It is necessary to alter a Western Electric 500 type

telephone instrument to nake it respond to the RFWT unit.

It

follows,

therefore, that entry nust be made into the target area

to complete installation.

Il entry is necessary, there are other

techniques such as the SPWT and 4-wire devices which should be

considered before resorting to the use of a classified technigue

requiring extrenely tight protective custody.

In general,

the ZAM unit follows the same installation

procedures and uses the same line switching principles as the

SPMT device set forth in Chapter 26, Part I, Page 181 of the

handbook of Technical Equipment. A

special

nicrophone unit, known

as a IAM, must be installed at a point in the target area where it

can be connected directly across the telephone line. The ZAM may

be disguised in a number of different configurations, for example,

In a 12A connecting block, in an auxiliary ringer, in the netvork

01 a telephone instrument, in a block measuring 1 9/1G inches long,

COMM-FBI

9/16 inch wide and 2/8 inch thick, ete.

The target telephone

line nust be looped through a local plant between the telephone

central office and the target area.

While it is desirable to

loop the target line through a plant by adding a minimun length

of vire, there are installations of record where spare pairs of

wires are used to develop the loop circuit.

The Bureau has a limited number of especially designed

remote control SPMT switching units for special applications.

secure place with 110 volt AC must be provided for looping the

target telephone line

through the remote control switching equipment.

The remote control switching equipment is housed in three cases,

two measuring 7 1/4 inches wide, 7 3/4 inches long and 4 1/4 inches

high, and one measuzing 11 1/2 inches wide, 15 inches long and 5 3/4

inches high.

The space should be as dust free as possible and

accessible for periodic maintenance checks.

If, after receiving authorization to make

a survey of

the target ares, you desire specific details concerning the

possible use of

the ZAM or other techniques in this case, subnit

cable prints, cable records showing multiple appearances, blocks

diagrams showing drop

wire and cable distribution points

for the

target area and all multiple apporances of the target line as

well as multiple appearances of spare pairs at target woring

appearance, to the Electronics Section of the Laboratory•

Too,

it will be helpful to know those points where apspare pair is

available for a leased line to the central monitoring plant:

This information is for technical assistance of the

sound trained Agents In your Division and does not constitute

authority to male a MISUE survey in captioned case.
