STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT AND DISMISSAL

Plaintiff, James H. Lesar, and defendant, the Central

Intelligence Agency ("CIA") hereby stipulate and agree, subject to

Court approval, as follows:

1.

Defendant enters into this Settlement Agreement

voluntarily, submitting that its actions have complied with the

requirements of all applicable laws, rules and regulations. The

parties agree that nothing in this Settlement Agreement is evidence

the defendant, nor upon any violation of any applicable law, rule

or regulation.

2. The records deemed to be at

issue in this case are defined

as those portions of the minutes of Director of Central

Intelligence ("DCI") Morning Meetings, for meetings held on or

between November 22, 1963 and December 31, 1979, that pertain to

the

thereof.

3.

Defendant agrees to process the records as defined in

paragraph 2 of this stipulation pursuant to the President John f.

Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (the "ARCA"),

Pub. L. No. 102-526, 106 Stat. 3443 (Oct. 26, 1992) (to be codified

at 44 U.S.C. § 2107 note).

4.

Defendant agrees to provide to plaintiff, at no cost,

copies of the documents, after processing by defendants under the

following conditions:

a. Where, after processing under the ARCA, records as

defined in paragraph 2 are to be released in full (without

redaction) to the public and are transferred by CIA to the National

Archives and Records Administration ("NARA"), the CIA agrees to

provide plaintiff with copies of such documents and the

identification aids prepared by the CIA for such documents, within

five (5) business days after their transfer to NARA;

b. Where, after processing under the ARCA, the CIA

determines to postpone the public disclosure of portions of agency

documents, under the standards contained in the ARCA, and notifies

the Assassination Records Review Board (the "Review Board") of that

decision, the CIA agrees to provide plaintiff with copies of such

documents, redacted by the CIA to eliminate the information for

which postponement of disclosure is sought, and the identification

aids prepared for those documents within five (5) business days

after the CIA transmits those documents to the Review Board; if

appropriate, the identification aids prepared for such documents

shall

also

be redacted

to eliminate information for which

postponement of disclosure is sought.

their entirety, under the standards contained in the ARCA, and

notifies the Review Board of that decision, the CIA agrees to

provide plaintiff with either copies of the identification aids

prepared for such documents (if the identification aids can be

disclosed without revealing information for which postponement is

sought) or a list identifying those documents, to the extent such

a list can be constructed without disclosing information sought to

be postponed.

d. Should the Review Board overrule the CIA's decision

to postpone the release

of information in the documents at issue

and determine that information contained in agency documents

Previously withheld by cIA should be publicly disclosed, and the

President of the United States does not overrule the Review Board's

determination as provided in section 9(d) of the ARCA, the CIA

agrees to provide plaintiff, at no cost, with copies of documents

containing

the additional information ordered released by the

Review Board within five (5) business days after the CIA transfers

those documents to NARA.

5.

Defendant's obligation

to provide plaintiff with

additional copies of documents ordered released by the Review Board

shall terminate one (1) year after the termination of the Review

Board.

6.
