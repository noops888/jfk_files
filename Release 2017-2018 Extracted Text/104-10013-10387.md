Sergio Vicente ARCACHA Smith (Enclosure 2 of reference memorandum)

DPOB: 22 January 1923, Cuba

1. Traces on ARCACHA do not reflect the date he first

arrived in the U.S. However,

he became the FriNTE REvOlU-

CIONARIO DEMOCRATICO (FRD) delegate in New Orleans prior

to the Bay of Pigs invasion and continued in that position

until the FID ceased to function. The IRD was the predecessor

of the CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, and was organized and

The organization was used as a

front for recrultment of Brigade 2506 for the Invaslon.

During this period ARCACHA reported to the IRD headqufters

in Miant through a post office box in Coral Gables, and

roportedly mintained extensive relations with the New

Two of his regular

FBI contacts were a Mr. De Bruce and the deceased Guy

Banister.

3.

ARCACHA was also one of the promoters of the

FRIKIDS OF DENOCRATIC CUBA, INC (FDC) which wis Incorporated

In Now Orlene on 6 amary 1961. This organieation was

ostensibly created by several New Orleans business and

political figures, including the deceased former FBI agent,

Guy Banister, to collect money to aid Cubans In thel

Iight against Communtom. According to the articles of

Incorporation, these donations vould also be used to support

the IRD and the funds were to be channeled through ARCACHA,

leas a percentage to be retained by the FDC. An lavest1-

sation conducted by a reliable Miami Station asset concluded

that the IDc ms organized strictly for the personal gain

of the promoters with the approval and collaboration of

ARCACHA •

The Investigation produced no evidence that any

Individual donations were ever solicited or received and

recommended that the funds of the Stevedores Union and the

booke of the New Orleans Exporters Company be investigated

for evidence of personal gain and possible evidence of

federal tax evasion, since both the president of the New

Orleans Exporters Company, Gerart I. Tunague, and the Chief

of New Orleans Stevedores

Unlon, Alfred Chittenden, were

officlals of the FDC.

Approximately one nonth after the

ide was created, strong criticin fron some prominent Cubans

put the orgnization out of business.

3. Information in an immigration card reflects that

ARCACHA travelled to Caracas, Venezuela at an unspecified

date.

His address In Venezuela was HOTEL TUNA, Caracas,

and his U8 addren was listed as 4523 Dupplenses Street,

New Orleans. Presport No. 00433.

Emilio SANTANA (paragraph Y C of reference: memorandon)

1. Subject is probably identifiable with Emilio SANTANA

Galindo, who was recruited by JIHAVE in December 1960 as a

guide for an infiltration tean.

SANTANA was paid a monthly

salary under provisions of his IC until he was terminated

on 15 October 1963 when the ratline developed by the team

becano inoperable due to occupation of the target area by

Soviet technicians. Another compelling reson for SANTANA/s

termination stenned fron his untruthful reporting concerning

certain aspects of the team operations.

2. In an attempt to establish positive identification,

JNHAVE obtained a report from the Dade County. (Hiam) I&

Sheriff's office: that an Emilio SANTANA (u0 matronynie)

born 6 July 1936 in Cuba, was declared a rugitive from

Louisiam on a federal warrant 22 December 1965, FBI Sheet

1322871, based on two counts of burglery in Louisiana.

He was arrested and booked by the Dade County Sheriff's

office on ? February 1966 and was presumably sent back to

Loulslana •:

living in Mlamt.

Headquarters files Indicate SANTANA 16

separated fron his wife who apparently still resides at

the old Miami address. Since SANTANA'S date of birth varies

on varfous documents in his 201 file, the variation in birth

date on his arrest sheet

not conelusive.

The fact he

did give his former address to the arresting offleers i

indicates he 1s Enilio SANTANA Galindo. A 1962 innigration

form includes a photograph which could be obtained from

JWAVE: for identification purposes 1f this becones necessary

Aithough JWAVE has had no contact uith SANTANA

since his termination, there is a note in Station (1les

dated 23 June 1964 that SANTANA used the Agency as his:

employer on an auto credit application.

and foreign language propaganda tapes and films on a world-

wide basts, conducts public forum of an extremint

political nture, etc. The organization. impetus and funde

Involved with INCA officials in planning the New Orleans

visit where Miss CASTRO was given an award at a dinner

sponsored by INCA. The dinner, which was attended by civic

leaders and representatives of all news media, took place

shortly after Miss CASTRO's defection and there was

considerable interest in her appearance. INCA was particularly

interested since it had distributed hundreds of English

and Spanish language tapes containing her statements when

she was surfaced in Mexico. In October 1966 INCA again

requested that MIss CASTRO

appear as a guest speaker In

major American cities in connection with the release of

DIRECTORIO REVOLUCIONARIO ESTUDIANTIL (DRE)

(STUDENT REVOLUTIONARY DIRECTORATE)

1. The DRE was conceived, created and funded by the

Agency in September 1960 and terminated in December 1966.

It was an outgrowth of the activist student group in Cuba

which fought against BATISTA and later against CASTRO.

Many Of the lenders came into exile around September 1960

and were subsequently tralned and infiltrated into Cuba

by the Agency in late 1960 where they operated by obtali

ing Intelligence setting up action teams, etc., up through

the Bay of Pigs invasion.

While the DRE

was initially set

up as a psych warfare outfit, the organization was given a

large amount of paramilitary aid in funds and material.

After the Bay of pigs, the DRE engaged in independent

military actions which declined at Agency direction and

because of a reduction in funds from late 1962 until ter

mination of the group.

Members were used through 1966 as

political action agents, for publishing propaganda which

was sent throughout the

Hemisphere, attending international

student meetings at Agency direction, and producing radio

programs and special propaganda campaigns.

2.

After the cutback in military operations, my

of the

best DRE members relocated in other areas. At

present there are delegations in most latin American coun-

tries which have mintained some contact "ith varlous

Agency stations over the years although the DRE 1s no

longer very active.

During the organization's 6 year

period of active existence DRE personnel were in contact

wIth several JWAVE staffers and outside contract agents.

However, from January 1965 through December 1966, contact

with DRE personnel was limited to two agents, Juan Manuel

SAlVat, the current Dis secretary Generad who e now

operating a bookstore in miami, florida, and fernando

GARCIA Chacon who was relocated in El Salvador.

FRENTE REVOLUCIONARIO DEMOCRATICO (FRD)

(CUBAN DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONARY FRONT)

I. The FRD was created with Agency assistance,

guidance and financial support in May 1960 and consisted

of several antI- CASTRO grOupS.

The FRD was formed as &

political action, propaganda and military unit.

Initial

actions consisted of extensive radio and printed propaganda,

denonstrations, and trips throughout the Herisphere to gain

support for the fight against CASTrO.

The IRD also functioned

as the front organization for recruiting the members of

the Bay of Pigs invasion force and carried out a massive

program of social assistance to Brigade 2506 menbers in

tralning camps and their families.

Although the FRD head-

quarters were based in Miami, delegates were assigned to

other areas which included New Orleans, Louisiana, Tampa,.

Florida, and Mexico City, to gather Intelligence and

coordinate Cuban refugee activities.

In late 1960 or early 1961 the CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY

COUNCIL (CRC) was formed to coordinate and direct FRD

activitles and this group was headed by Agency and White

House sponsored Dr. Jose hike cardona, assisted by anuel

ARTIME and Dr. Antonio VARONA. Both the IRD and the CRC

continued to function until October 1961 when theIRD was

completely absorbed by the CRC in order to avold the confusion

resulting from duplication of personnel, actlvities und

funding.

The CRC also had direct access to President

Kennedy and top White House sides. Bacause of the magnitude

of the IRD and CRC operations and the Agency participation

In the activities and funding of the groups, a large number

of JWAVE and Headquarters were directly Involved with both

FRD and CRC personnel.
