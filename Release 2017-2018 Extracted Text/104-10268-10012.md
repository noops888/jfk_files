Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

1. Unilateral Coverage:

From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947 until

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in

Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK

isted of multiline

phone taps, three photographic sites, a mobi

veillance team and a

mail intercept operation.

Telephone taps (LIFE

telephone company who

of lines tapped wa

mited only by the availability of a listening post

nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,

Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-

• American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer

assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station

on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These

operations had

sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC

and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-

bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned

street on the southeast corner of' that block. (See attached diagram).

LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental

basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

tion received word that the photograph of the "unidentified man" was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site

bu

he middle of

the block south. It had a planted view of the

Embassy. LICALLA, the third photograph

negate of the Soviet

was located in one of a

@the Soviet Embassy compound.

This site overlooked the

arden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The

purpose of this operat

was to get good identification photographs of

Soviet personnel.

The three photographic sites were managed by a re-

cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother

and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the

LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-

veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was

originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-

nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.

These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents

which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team

could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of

interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of

the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for

identification purposes.

The Station also conducted a unilateral mai

the nature of the Mexican services at that time. The Mexican Direction

was principally occupied with political investigations and control of

foreigners. Their agents were wish Tell, and corrupt. A Station

officer trained a number of them in name tracing and travel control.. In

1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a joint telephone tap

operation came into existence.

connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican

Army officers. In 1961, because of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-

cipals, the Station chief, himself, becane the project case officer. A

Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening

post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes. There was also

an American technician inside the listening post.

3. Oswald Coverage:

In mid-1962, the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (the

joint tap operation) asked the American officer at the LLENVOY listening

post for the telephone numbers of the soviet, cute are lite En-

taps. The Mexicans se

ifter connected five Cuban lines, five

Soviet Tines, three Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav

line. At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of

conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume

for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,

full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-

tions but because of the volume of Russian conversations, the translations

usually ran about a week behind the date of the conversation.

As soon as the Station learned that an American identifying him-

self as Lee Oswald phoned the Soviet Embassy, Miss Ann Goodpasture of the

Station started screening all photographs. However, here agado,

was a backlog because the photographs were picked

The instructions were to cover the entire work day (office hours) and to

foreign license plates. Human error did occur but generally the agents

• were conscientious. The Cuban Embassy coverage had more sophisticated

equipment using a pulse camera which frequently developed mechanical dif-

ficulties.

be sure. Later this house began to fall apart. This base vas closed

when

the Station got word that the photo of "uniden man" was being releasea

to the

public by

the Warren Commission. The photo operators were moved to another apt

nearby. The property vas sold (under an operational agreement with LINOUSINE

for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment biding to be built

on this site). LILYRIC was planned as an alternate photo base to LIMITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor-check) on the sare side of the street

as LIMITED but in the middle of the block South. It had a slanted view of

the front gate of the Soviet Erbassy. The agents in LIATED and LILYRIC (both

Vexican families) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.

LILYRIC was a rented apartment. LICALIA, the third paoto pite,) was located

it to Herbert Manell to take to Boris. Herbert Manall and his wife Berbera

I am certain that the Oswald call came to our attention from the

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy

Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that

the Consul is not there.

The unidentified man asked what is needed

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the

Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial

America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the

ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to

Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest....

LIENVOY

10 AFTER ANALYZING ALL THE TRAFFIC AND READING THE STATEMEN

SILVIA DURAN, ONE IMPORTANT QUESTION STILL PUZZLES US:

WHEN LEE

OSWALD WAS IN MEXICO CITY IN LATE SEPTEMBER ANDEARLY OCTOBER TO

GET A SOVIET VISA AND A CUBANI

SET VISA, DID HE WANT TO TRAVEL

TO CUBA RIGHT AWAY, ALONE, OR HAVE HIS WIFE JOIN HIM THERE AND

THEN LEAVE FOR CUBA, OR DID HE PLAN TO RETURN TO THE STATES FIRST

AND THEN LEAVE LATER• ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS THAT HE WAS THEN THINKING

ONLY ABOUT A PEACEFUL CHANGE OF RESIDENCE TO THE SOVIET UNION,

IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT HE WAS GETTING DOCUMENTED TO MAKE A QUICK

ESCAPE AFTER ASSASSINATING THE PRESIDENT-

20 PLEASE RESTUDY POUR LIENVOY MATERIAL AND GIVE US YOUR OPINION,

AND ALSO HAVE MEXICANS QUESTION SILVIA DURAN VERY CAREFULLY Oi

THIS POINT•

ADVISE.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE

THE DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE AND RESEARCH

WASHINGTON

SECRET

OCT 25 1960

Dear Dick:

Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including some

from the White House Staff, have revealed that,

though CIA and the

FET have detailed records concerning Americans who have been recruited

as Intelligence agents by Bloc countries,

there does not appear to be

a complete listing of those Americans now living in Bloc countries

who might be called "defectors".

Using the definitions of DID 4/2,

these persons might be described as those who have either been

capable of providing ussiul intelligence to the Bloc or those whose

desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited

for communist propaganda purposes.

This would mean that no attention

need be paid to Americans shose resettlement within the Bloc had no

counter-intelligence implications or had attracted no particular

attention; for instance,

this definition rould not cover individual

US citizens of East European or Chinese origin who returned to the

"homeland because they had never been completely assimilated into

the American society.

There is attached a list of such persons, covering the last 18

months, and It would be appreciated if the Agency could verify and

possibly expand thia list for the use of interested Bureaus of, the

Department.

Sincerely yours,

Hase

Hugh S. Cumming, Jr.

showed that OSWAID could not possibly have been in Vesica

The wife is being interrogated. I don't know if that took place jesterds

or is still going on. You are getting a teletype answer on that. I am

just giving you a preview.

With regard to that, Nicaraguan's, allegations that the man was in the

Cuban Eubassy on 18 September, I understand we do have information that

he applied for a tourist card about the 15th of Segtember. There is a

record showing entry into Mexico on Septenber 26. On about the 15th be

applied in New Orleans for a tourist card.
