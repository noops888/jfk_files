GABRIEL MANNARINO, aka

SAMUEL MANNARINO, aka

Remyairtel, 3/29/61.

By airtel 3/28/61 Miami advised that the Gold Coast Restaurant,

Hollywood, Fla.,

is owned by one JOE SONKEN, originally from

Chicago, Ill., and that this restaurant is a notorious hoodlum

handout.

It was set out that KELLY MANNARINO is known to

be acquainted with SONKEN and the possibility exists that

SONKEN received the aluminum ware delivered to MANNARINO

by RALPH THOMAS.

on 3/30/61 PG 615-C advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III as follows:

The "tightening up" policy put in effect in the New Kensington

Arnold, Pa., gambling circles by the MANNARINOs during the past

year is pointed up by the situation involving JIMMY BURGART

who operates a cigar-confectionery store at 956 5th Ave.;

New Kensington. For about thirty years BURGART has had a

lucrative numbers-lottery-horse book business at that location,

grossing in recent years as much as $100,000. In the summer

of 1960 the MANNARINOs issued instructions that BURGART was

not to take horse bets any longer but was to refer players to

go directly to the MANNARINO horse-room a block away at 937

Barnes St., New Kensington. If BURGARI had done this he would

have lost the commissions he, received on bets made so he refused

to comply with the instructions and continued to accept bets

and then telephone them

in to the horse-room. This localized
