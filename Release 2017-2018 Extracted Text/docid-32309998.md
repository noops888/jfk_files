ADMINISTRATIVE:

On 8/4/70, SA ROGER A. BOMBARDIER conducted a

discreet inquiry at Fornof Cadillac-Oldsmobile Dealer,

West Main St.,

Houma, La., and determined that a white over

gold 1970 Cadillac bearing 1970 Louisiana license 51 M 04]

is owned by BOB COURNOYER; Sales Manager, Fornof Company.

COURNOYER is the subject of New Orleans 165-1527.

• During SA BOMBARDIER's conversation with COURNOYER

on 8/4/70, COURNOYER stated that he recently purchased four

race horses in claim races in Chicago and that these horses,

along with 12 others, owned by Mr. BRADY of the Brady Machine

Company in Houma, La., were being trained by SANDY BROUILLETTE

of Abbeville, Louisiana.

COURNOYER asked SA BOMBARDIER that if he received

a telephone call from his trainer in Chicago advising that

one of his horses looked good in an upcoming race, whether or

not he could bet this horse with his trainer and not be in

violation of any Federal law.

COURNOYER was advised to con-

tact his attorney or the USA's Office in New Orleans for

legal advice regarding this matter.

New Orleans indices contain no references for E. W.

STEFFENHAGEN or :. Avla, Inc. Indices did contain an old 33

celerence from a Jackson Division file on EDWIN M. ANDERSON

However, this file has apparently been destroyed.
