Dallas letter to Chicago, 9/16/69.

information and current activities regarding DOLAN while

in Chicago.

Information was furnished byl

(protect) presently at 2311 Commonwealth, Chicago, whom

DOLAN had lived with at 423 Wrightwood since coming to

Chicago in November, 1968.

According tol

DOLAN has since moved from

Chicago.

received a letter from DOLAN postmarked

August 2,

1969,

from Denver, Colorado, with a Reno, Nevada

return address of 1275 Fairfield Avenue.. It ds to be noted

that this address

is that of DOLAN's mother.

Enclosed in

this letter were two keys to the

apartment at

423 Wrightwood.

It is apparent that DOLAN is not establishing a

permanent residence in Chicago. Chicago feels that it

would be premature to transfer office of origin at this time

in view of information which would indicate DOLAN is no

longer in Chicago and in view of information furnished by

that DOLAN travels extensively.

DOLAN SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS

AS HE HAS

BEEN IDENTIFIED

PARTICIPANT IN A ROBBERY

WITH FIREARMS AND HAS BEEN KNOWN TO BE IN POSSESION OF
