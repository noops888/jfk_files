Hudsoh and the undersigned.

The contract and payroll.

files of MI. Hunt were reviewed for possibla indications

of the nature of the operational activity undertaken in

Madrid.

A review of traval vouchers indicated that Mr.

Hunt and his fanily made accountings indicating departure

from Washington, D. C.,

on 5 August 1965 with an arrival

in Madrid, Spain,: On 16 August 1965. The costs of this

travel were charged to the budget of the Western Hami

sphere Division, Deputy Directorate for Plans, L

marized PCS travel expenses and included a payment for

apartment rental for 16, 17 and 18 August 1965 with a

payment in the amount of $125 to Mr.

this purpose.

It was detormined that an allottee bank account

in Mr. Hunt's name had been establlshed at the Riggs

National Bank of Washington. All salary and other non-

operational reimbursements were made to Mr. Hunt through

sterile check to this account.

An operational account

was established for Mr. Hunt with the Chase Manhattan

Bank of New York City.

A review of all payments made to

Mr. Hunt through the Chase bank account through Mr. Hunt's

operational advance subsidiary account, or 1442 account,

had been made.

There was no record of any operational

accounts or advances being processed through this channel.

Mr. Yale stated that this fact defined his concern. He

felt that it was inconceivable that Mr. Hunt could have

uncertaken operationa, activity without sone transter of

or accounting for funds.

A review made of

These two accounts would normally be the source

of operational funding not charged against a specific pro-

ject activity.

for Mr- Hunt during this period also failed to identify

a project.

In addition to the PCS and return vouchers,

two other accountings are on record.

the renewal of visas." A second voucher covered a TDY

trip fron Madrid to Hashingion with return to Madrid

nada by MI. Hunt from 5 January to 8 January 1966. Tho

voucher states in the space providad for the citation of

the travel order number - "no travel order."

The account

ing was approved and signed by Mr. Thomas Karamessines,

then Baputy Director for Plans. No justification or

statement of purpose for this TDY was given on the account-

Ing.

sources or identification of operational funding was in

order.

XI. Yale gave instructions that the entire 1442

adrance account of Mr. Hunt be reviewed for other possiblo

Channels of funding outside of the New York Chase account.

After discussion, it was agreed that particular attention.

be taken to any stens connected with publishing or book

royalties. Mi. Yale noted that the royalty offset waiver

provision anmended to M5. Hunt's contract was, in his ex-

perience, somewhat unsual.

Division D, who was at the time of Mr. Hunt's Madrid assign

ment, Deputy Chiaf of the Western Henisphere Division.
