SUBJECT:

Doug Bowman

Legislative Officer, OCA

John Carver

Historical Review Group/CSI

Documents Discovered in CIA's JFK

Assassination Records For Which We

Need the Approval of Congress Before

Releasing Them to NARA

1.

In accordance with the John F. Kennedy

Assassination Records Act of 1992, the Historical Review

Group of the Central Intelligence Agency has the task of

declassifying CIA's documents sequestered during the

King GATE d cone

investigations by the House Select Committee on

Assassinations in 1976-78.

2.

In the course of our processing, we have identified

nine copies of documents which originated in or are the

property of the U.S. Senate or the U.S. House of

Representatives, and which

are separate from the documents

originated by the House Select Committee on Assassinations.

Our normal procedure for handling documents under the third

agency rule is to make copies of another agency's documents

available to that agency for its own review, after which we

reintegrate those documents in our files at

the point where

they were discovered and then release, sanitize, or deny as

prescribed by the third agency.

3. Documents belonging to Congress fall into a special

case, as the third agency rule cannot properly apply.

ask,

therefore, that you show these nine documents to the

appropriate people on the Hill--in essence, coordinate them

with Congress on our behalf--and ask them to indicate in

some fashion,

on the documents themselves or in a separate

message, their agreement (or objection) to our release of

these documents to National Archives, as required by the

Act.

4. You will note that the letters from Senator Inouye

and from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence are the

only two of these documents whose originators remain on the

scene in today's Congress.

Documents Discovered in CIA'S JFK Assassination

Records for Which We Need the Approval of Congress

Before Releasing Them to NARA

We judge that the letter from a private citizen to

the Bictish Ambassador, which later found its way to senator

Hayakawa's office, does not require the normal protection on

foreign policy grounds.

6. Thanks for your help.
