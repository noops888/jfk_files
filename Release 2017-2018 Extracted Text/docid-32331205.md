According to information received from Miss

ESTELLE KASS, Manager, Hampshire Towers Apts., 5415 Collins

Ave., Miami Beach, TOURINE! has not been seen around his

apartment for approximately 3 months.

This would indicate

TOURINE has not been in the Miami area

since February, or

March, 1963, and has probably been residing in Washington,

D. C. area.

New York Office reported TOURINE was at his New

York apartment on 4/28-29/63.
