KC 358-C-TE on 1/22/69 advised SA ROY L. TUSSEY

as follows:

FRANK TOUSA, a member of the Kansas City "Outfit"

which is synonynous with the LN, told this source on

1/22/69 that the two biggest bookmakers in Las Vegas,

Nevada,

have stopped disseminating the "daily basketball line"

because of statements recently attributed to the new Attorney

General of the United

relating to the use of wire

tapping against organized crime.

TOUSA said that he

telephonically contacted his

sources in Las Vegas for a

"line" on 1/21/69 and was told that his sources have dis-

continued for the time being.

As of 1/21/69, TOUSA, who

directs bookmaking activities of the Kansas City "Outfit"

does not have an available basketball line which has curtailed

bookmaking activities in Kansas City.

Above source advised that MIKE LASCUOLA, another

Kansas City bookmaker, has complained to this source that the

s statements relating to

the use of wire tapping by FBI against organized crime.
