MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Field Station Records

28 August 1998

CIA SPECH COLLECTIONS

B IN FULL

1. (U) The DO record schedule has been reviewed and approved

by the National Archives and Records Administration.

It

states that that all information that meets retention

criteria is stored in the DO Records System at

Headquarters. Information retained in the field is

strictly for

convenience and may be destroyed when no

longer needed. All unique information must be sent to

Headquarters

for retention purposes.

2. (S)

This records' maintenance practice serves two

primary purposes.

First, in the event of a hostile

situation the field office can destroy their files and

latter reconstitute them from information contained

within the DO Records System.

Secondly, we can

satisfy

DO search requirements by searching the records at

Headquarters.

This minimizes delays in responding to the

request and minimizes impacts on field station personnel.

3. (S)

The question specifically focused on Mexico City for

the

years 1963-1964 and Moscow for the years 1959-1962.

we checked

"the record system to verify the fact and we

do

not hold any separate file collections from Moscow or

Mexico City field stations.
