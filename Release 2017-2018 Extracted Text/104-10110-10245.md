1. On 24 June 1963, Mr. Charles Matt, SAS/MOB/PM, extension

6488, was referred to me by the SAS Security Officer, Mr. George

Ladner, and visited me in Room 4 E 21 to request some operational

support beginning 1 July 1963. Mr. Matt advised that two leaders

ing the "new program" for the exiles.

Q2. Mr. Matt explained that & covert site (#302 922) located

at

Maryland, had recently been

procured to billet these exiles and to serve as the meeting place

for these sensitive discussions to take place. Mr. Matt said that

SAS is vitally Interested in what these two exiles say to each other

when the U. S. Government officials have departed after a day's

discussions.

He, therefore, requested that microphones be concealed

in the house to monitor their comments.

3. Mr. Matt said that the two men would arrive on 1 July and

would be in Washington at the house for about a week or ten days.

The audio coverage was requested for this entire time. Mr. Matt

also said that the house would be retained for several more months

and that the two exiles would return to Washington several more

times In that period and that an audio surveillance would probably

be requested for these latter visits also.

(b.) With the use of directories, search the

environs of the safehouse for the purpose

of locating a potential listening post where

radio transmissions could be monitored.

Field Office and directed some agents to case the house and the

District Field Office, and after a quick survey, he reported that

8. About Noon on 25 June

I received a telephone call from

thing had been laid on by SAS for

me to obtain from TSD any

equipment necessary for this operation. Mr. McBee directed that

I fill out & Form #88 and have the technicians hand carry it to

the Franconia Depot in order to obtain the equipment.

the For $88 disturbed me in this matter because I had aasumed of

from Mr. Halpern that he would arrange it so that ISD would turn

over the equipment to us without charge to anyone. The use of

the Form #88 implies that a division is allocating funds for the

purchase of equipment. However, I filled out the Form $88,

listing the above eguipment, and walked it down to SAS, where 1

gave It to Charles Matt to have signed. The form, bearing the

SAS Cost Center #3132-5455-3400, was completed and returned to

me within an hour, whereupon I gave 1t to DFO Agent Stan Lach,

who drove with it Immediately to the Franconia Depot. I called

ahead to Bob Woods and Charlie Beall of the T & I Shop at Franconia

and requested that they give a little briefing concerning the

operation of this equipment to Mr. Lach and Mr. Cryer, who was to

meet Mr. Lach there.

Neither Cryer nor Lach had ever had any

experience with any of the pieces of equipment on the list. Mr.

Woods and Mr. Beall were quite cooperative in this request.

9.

Several problems kept appearing and disappearing while

the DFO technicians were transporting, installing, and testing

the equipment. One problem was the payment of the equipment.

I;

received a telephone call from Mr. Dayton S. ("Doc") Barrows of

TSD, Informing me that SAS had reneged on paying the $2,802.95 for

equipment, but that If I would tell him what equirment we

wanted, he might be able to arrange to lend 1t to us.

I told Mr.

Barrows that as far as I knew, we had indeed obtained the equipment

with the Form #88, but that if we needed anything else, I would

contsct him. Another problem which appeared was the rumor that

It was not two Cuban exiles who would be residing in the safehouse,

but only the captioned Subject and & Spanish speaking Staff employee.

If the rumor were actually true, it would seem that an audio

surveillance of the safehouse would not be necessary.

I called

Charles Matt for an explanation, and he informed me that Senor

Artime was going to be the only person living in the house after

each day's discussions were completed - no Staff employee would

be living with him. I asked Mr. Matt to whom Senor Artime would be

holding the conversations which we were to record. He replied

that he was interested in any visitors which the subject might

receive and any telephone calls which he might make. I suggested

hat possibly & telephone tap might be sufficient under thes

ircumstances. Mr. Matt disagreed and still requested a micro

phone installation to cover the whole house if possible.

10. In addition to the equipment obtained from ISD, the DEO

agents took their own SRR-4 tuneable receiver and the SRR-4 charged

to the WFO. These receivers would be used in the listening post to

pick up the radiations from the two SRT-OH transmitters.

It was

suggested to the DrO agents to borrow the two WFO transceivers to

be used to commnicate during the installation between the listening

post and the safehouse; however, the agents chose not to use them

and relied solely on telephonic comminications.

The "A" and "y"

batteries picked up at Franconia were to be used in the SRR-4

receiver so that checks could be made from an automobile to see

just how far the radiations extended around the transmitters. A

report on the area covered by the transmitters was requested of

the DrO agents.

Il. The first test of the SPI-H from the safehouse to the

Ilstening post was a failure.

Its 50 milliwatt output, ordinarily

good for & quarter mile, wasn't sufficient to reach the receiver,

2/10th's of a mile away.

Its fallure was blamed partly on the

distance, partly on the brick construction of the listening post,

and partly on the hilly contours of the housing development, which

deflected the 135 megacycle, line-of-sight radiations.

12.

When this disheartening news arrived, I Immediately

telephoned Mr. Barrows of ISD and requested a pair of the more

powerful 150 milliwatt SRI-T transmitters. I telephoned Mr.

Barrows rather than filling out another Form 788 to avoid a

Mr. Barrows consented to loan two of

these transmitters with their proper receivers on a hand receipt

to us, and Stan Lach was dispatched to Franconia to pick them up.

An opportunity to test it on 28 June 1963 was thwarted because

Twas baving foreign visitors in for cocktails tin

that afternoon.

But the equipment was installed and tested the

next day, Saturday, 29 June, and appeared to work satisfactorily.
