' ADMINISTRATIVE (Cont'a)

"possible violation of the entry provisions of Section

1185 (b), it 1s extremely doubtful whether a jury could be

persuaded to convict Lee of a felony calling for upwards of

five years imprisonment for simply having overstayed his

validated leave in Cuba by some three weeks.

Therefore,

It is our opinion that the facts are such as to give no

reasonable assurance of a successful prosecution under the

entry provisions of 8 U.S.C. 1185 (b).

"With regard to a possible violation of the

Foreign Agents Registration Act (22 U.S.C. 611 et seq.),

the only evidence to establish that the subject was

requested by an official of a foreign government to perform

a certain activity within the United States is hearsay in

nature.

There is no witness available who can testify that

he was present when such a request was made of the subject.

There is likewise no available witness who can testify that

he was present when the subject accepted money from an

official or agent of a foreign government. In the absence

of either of these elements, prosecution under the Foreign

Agents Registration Act would fail and therefore 1t 1s our

opinion that the evidence is insufficient to establish a

violation of the Act."
