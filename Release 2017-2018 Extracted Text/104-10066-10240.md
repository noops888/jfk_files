NITRUST HAS RESPONDED ORALLY TO OUR NOTE CONCERNING

PASSAGE

OF GIGALE INFORMATION ON THE VLAAMSE MILITANTENORDE

(VMO) TO THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS.

GIST OF HIS

COMMENT:

HE WILL NOT PASS US INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE UMO

ANCIT CONTACIS,

BECAUSE THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT WILL

PLACE SUCH INFORMATION AT RISK; AND IN GENERAL HE WILL NOT

APPROVE PASSAGE OF INTGALE INFORMATION ON THE UMO TO CONGRESS

BECAUSE HE HAS INSUFFICIENT ASSURÄNCE THAT THE MATERIAL WILL

NOT LEAK, DESPITE OUR ASSURANCES THAT THE SUBJECT WOULD BE

HANDLED AS CLASSIFIED AND SENSITIVE.

2.

WE ARE ANAITING WRITTEN REPLY TO LEARN WHETHER THERE

ANY GIVE IN NITRUST ATTITUDE:

RE AMCIT ASPECT, WE SUSPECT

THERE IS MEASURE OF POSTURING ON NITRUST'S SIDE. IN REF B

ACOS/NIGALE -75 DISCUSSION, LATTER REMARKED THAT

TO BEST HIS

KNOWLEDGE THE ONLY KNOVN UMO CONNECTION WITH AMERICAN WAS

INCIDENT IN ABOUT EARLY 1977 WHEN ORGANIZATION MET BRIEFLY

WITH AiN AMERICAN NAZI PARTY MEMBER WHO HAD BEEN EXPELLED FROM

UK AND PASSED THROUGH BELGIUM.

HE DISCUSSED THE CASE WITH US

AT THE TIME (NAME OF TRAVELLER NOT RECALLED BY (N-75)OR ACOS).

THERE IS NO WAY HE CAN DISLODGE LITRUST'S OBVIOUS

SET ON THE CONGRESSIONAL SITUATION.

QUESTION OF CONGRESS

ASIDE, IF HEADQUARTERS CAN PROVIDE SPECIFICS ON FOIA MECHANICS

WHICH ME CAN USE TO COUNTER INTRUST'S ASSERTION THAT RTACTION.

CANNOT PROTECT

SOURCES PROVIDING INFORMATION ON

AMERICANS, NE WOULD BE HAPPY TO MAKE SUCH POINTS WITH NITRUST.
