Re Newark airtel to Bureau dated 7/26/62.

Referenced Newark airtel expresses Newark's

inability to understand the meaning of a sentence described

by NEWARK as being on page 4 of Philadelphia airtel to

Bureau dated 7/13/62.

It is believed that Newark is

questioning the last sentence of paragraph 3 on page 5.

For the information of Newark, PH 614-C-TE Is

not "absolutely certain" that TONY (LNU) is from Trenton,

N. J.; however,

"believed" TONY INU is from the

Trenton area as stated in Philadelphia airtel dated 7/13/62.

Informant stated that his beliefe is based

on two observations:

(1) TONY's obvious friendship with CHARLES

COSTELLO, a resident of Trenton, N.J.

COSTELLO's statement to informant that TONY

had seen him (COSTELLO) driving in Trenton and that TONY

had told him

him (on

(COSTELLO the names of streets on which he

(COSTELLO) was driving when observed by TONy.

Informant was again contacted 7/27/62 concerning

the above and was unable to furnish additional formation.

гьEсIvRH 623-C* has to date been unable to furnish additional

"information concerning TONY's identity.
