MEMORANDUM FOR THE SPECIAL GROUP (AUGMENTED)

Subject:

Consequences of US Military Intervention

1n Cuba (TS)

1. On 2 August 1962 the Chief of Operations, Operation

MONGOOSE, requested the DOD/JCS Representative, Operation

MONGOOSE, to prepare a paper for distribution to the Special

Group (Augmented) on 8 August 1962. The specific requirement

is to set forth "Consequences of (US) Military Intervention

(in Cuba) to include cost (personnel, units and equipment),

effect on world-wide ability to react, possibility of a require-

ment for sustained occupation, the level of national mob1l1-

zation required, and Cuban counteraction." Pursuant to

this request, the requirement has been divided into its

separate parts.

2. Requirements (personnel, units and equipment)

261,000 US military personnel would participate

3. Level of National Mobilization Required.

a. Army - None. In lieu of mobilizing Civil Affairs

units from the active reserve, tactical forces, though not

trained for this mission, will be employed to conduct Civil

Affairs/Military Government operations.

b. Navy - For troop and cargo sealift, no rise in

mobilization level would be required beyond the present

authority held by the Maritime Administration to charter

shipping.

c. Air Force - In order to land the maximum number of

airborne troops in the minimun time

19 teen 412 Dare

Reserve troop, carrier squadrons (C-119) were originally

included in the airlift plan

however, CINCLANT and USAF

have been requested to prepare alternate plans not involving

any mobilization prior to D-day.

d. Marines - None.

e. Further mobilization would be required if a concurrent

political or military situation exists which would make such

a precaution desirable in order to assure US military

responsiveness to additional demands.

4. Effect on World-Wide Ability to React - The present basic

contingency plan anticipates achieving control of key strategic

areas in Cuba within

lays. Subsequent to gaining such

control of the island there will be a progressive withdrawal

of forces as the situation permits.

CONAD air defense capabilities in southeast United

States will be augmented by the additional Naval and Air

Force forces brought into the area for this operation. There-

fore, no redeployment of CONAD forces from other areas is

anticipated.

5. Castro-Cuban Counteraction.

a. The military reaction will be determined in large

measure by the will of the Cuban armed forces to resist, as

well as by the weapons available to them and their proficiency

in their use, at the time of US military intervention.

b. The military capabilities of Cuba are oriented

primarily toward defensive activities. Cuban plans are

belleved to contemplate a strong initial resistance, followed

by a determined defense of preselected keypoints, and finally

by protracted guerrilla warfare.

c. Cuba has about 50 MIG fighters, some of which may be

configured for carrying light bombs. Any of these that

survive the US air strikes could be used offensively against

targets in Florida. Also they have 11 B-26 aircraft some of

which, if they survive the air strikes by US forces, could

attempt to attack targets in the southeastern United States.

All forces engaged in the operation, as well as the

Continental Air Defense forces, however, would be alert to

guard against any such attempts at retaliation.

d. In the future the Castro-Cuban

capability for counter-

action will improve if Soviet's continue to provide the

Cubans with additional military equipment and training.

thus, the urgency of the requirement to remove the Communist

government from Cuba is made apparent by Castro's constantly

increasing capabilities.

6. Possibility of a Requirement for a Sustained Occupation.

a. The duration of a US military presence in Cuba is

contingent upon such factors as the will of Castro-Cuban

forces to resist invasion, the degree of popular support

a defeated Castro might recelve for the conduct of residual

guerrilla operations, and time required to reconstitute an

effective friendly Cuban government.

b. Following the establishment of essential military

control of the island, a substantial US military commitment

may be required in Cuba for a significant period of time.

Post assault tasks will include restoration of law and

order and the conduct of counterguerrilla operations.

c. To achieve the objectives of subparagraph b above,

it is planned that the post assault military presence

initially will consist of substantial Army follow-on

forces with such other sea and air support as may be required.

This will be reduced gradually in size as the effectiveness of

the new Cuban government increases. Thereafter, a lengthy

period of providing military assistance is anticipated.
