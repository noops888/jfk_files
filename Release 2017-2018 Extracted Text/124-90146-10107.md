Moore (and his friend Sandy Bethune) and the late Malcolm X, which

SUGAR obtained this transcript

on 4 June from the editor of the West Indian Gazette, (fnu) Manchanda.

SUGAR believes that Manchanda got the photostat from the Ghana High

Commission office in London.

He further believes that the Afro-

American unity group in Paris (among whom there is only one member

citizenship: the American Negro photographer,

probably supplied the transcript to the Ghana officials as a means of

building their credentials as a bona fide revolutionary organization,

WHERE SHOWM OTHERWISE.

BACKGROUND:

y* Subject, a United States citizen, is included in the

Security. Index based on past pro-Castro-Cuban sympathies

activities and his participation in Communist China propaganda

publications.

He was one of the founders of Fair Play for Cuba

Committee; was President of the New York Chapter and became

Acting National Executive Secretary in 1961.

In 1960 he was

forced to resign as Columbia Broadcasting System newsman for

publicly expressing himself as sympathetic to the Castro regime.

In 1961 he was accredited to the United Nations as correspondent

for a Cuban publication, "Revolucion."

• In September, 1962, he

went to Algeria where he remained until April, 1963.

He then went

-to Switzerland and Paris representing "Africa, Latin-America;

Asia Revolution," a publication reportedly financed by Communist

China and he remained with that organization until 1964 when he

became suspect as a Central Intelligence Agent by others affiliated

with that publication,

* He is now in London and is having financial

difficulties.

At his request, Gibson was interviewed by Bureau Agents

on August 16, 1962, during which he indicated he would assist the

Bureau;or Central Intelligence Agency in return. for money but not

because of allegiance to the United States.

He stated he did not

particularly 'like the Bureau,and interviewing Agents described him

they did not plan to contact him.

That Agency on May 7, 1965,

advised that they are now operating the subject as a source.

He is now in Europe and may travel to Africa and Southeast

Asia on behalf of that Agency S

OBSERVATIONS:

In view of subject's questionable character and

past activities, it is not belleved that we should

• exonerate

him solely because he is

operating as a Central Intelligence

Agency source: Rather than be lulled into a false sense of

security, we will continue to be most circumspect with him

and continue to follow his activities until he proves beyond

issued to Gibson on January 25, 1961, and stated that

"from the article it appears that this individual is now

using this passport to enable him to carry activities

against the United States through a Chinese Communist

network which reaches to various parts of the World.

I

would appreciate your comments as to whether such activities

contribute to. United States foreign policy objectives and,

if not, what can be done to prevent such action by United

States citizens."

By undated letter, Mr. Dutton wrote Senator Keating

and stated, in part,

that "The present activities of Mr.

Gibson to which you

refer in your letter will be carefully

examined to determine if they are prejudicial to the

orderly conduct of United States relations within the meaning

of Section 51, 136 (b) of the Department's Passport

Regulations.

In order to take any passport action

regulations,

the activities must be of such a nature as to seri-

ously interferewith relations between the United States and

foreign governments and, under existing regulations,

fact must be established by evidence or witnesses at a

hearing in the Passport Office."

By letter of April 28, 1964, Mr. Dutton advised

Senator Keating that "The Department's passport regulations

provide,

in 22 C.F.R. 51. 136, for refusal of passport

tacilities,

except for direct

United States,

to aperson whose activities would be

prejudicial to the orderly conduct of foreign relations

or otherwise prejudicial to the interests of the United

States.

If the newspaper clipping which you enclosed with

your letter accurately describes Mr. Gibson's present

activities in Paris,

those activitles obviously are not

helpful to United States foreign policy objectives.

It is

another question, however, whether they are so prejudicial

to the orderly conduct of

United States foreign relations

or the interests of the United States to justify the limitation

of passport facilities under Section 51. 136 of

the

Department's regulations.

On the basis of available

information, the Department has concluded they are not.

However, we are asking our Embassy at Paris for information

regarding Mr. Gibson's activities.

we receive will,

of course, be carefully considered in the

light of the existing passport laws and regulations."

Robert E. Lee, Acting Assistant Secretary For

Congressional Relations, sent a letter

to Senator Keating on

September 30,

1964, which stated, in part,

that "the

Supreme Court in the Flynn and Aptheker decisions rendered

moot the question of withdrawing Mr. GIbson's passport

because of alleged Communist activities®

the Flynn

and Aptheker cases concerned Section 6 of the

the Internal

Security act of 1950 which (1) made it unlawful for any

member of a Communist organization to apply for a passport

or to use a passport, and (2) made it unlawful for any

officer or employee of the United States to issue a passport

to or to renew the passport of any individual

knowing or

having reason to believe that such

individual is a member

of such organization. The Supreme Court held that Section 6

was unconstitutional because

it swept too widely and too

indiscriminately

across

the freedom to travel guaranteed

in the Fifth Amendment."

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times"

newspaper contained a fullopage advertisement captioned

"what Is Really Happening In Cuba," placed by the fair Play

for Cuba Committee (FPCC. This advertisement announced

the formation of the FPCC in New York City

and declared the

FPCC intended to promulgate

othe truth about revolutionary

Cuba"' to neutralize the distorted American press.

"The New York Times" edition of January 11,

reported

that at a hearleg condueted before the united states

Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10,1961,

DI. Charles A. Santos Buch identified himsell and Robert

Taber as organizers of the FPCC. He also testified he and

Taber obtained funds fron the Cuban Goverment which were

applied toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.

between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP)

elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby.

influence IPCC policy.

This source added that during the

past year there had been a successful effort by FPCC leadership

to minimize

the role

of these and other organizations in

the

FPCC so that their influence as of May, 1963, was negligible.

The SWP has been designated pursuant to Executive

Order 10450•

On May 20,

1963,

a second source advised that

Vincent

"Ted" Lee,

FPCC National Office Director,

was then

formulating FPCC policy and had indicated that he

had no

intention of permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any

other organization.

This source

stated that Lee believed

that the FPCC should advocate resumption of diplomatic

relations between Cuba and the United States and should

support the right of Cubans to manage their revolution

without interference from other nations. lee did

not

advocate supporting the Cuban revolution per se.

APPENDIX

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEL

The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York

Times" reported that senator

Thomas I, Dodd of Connecticut

had called FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of

the Castro network in the United States."

It is to be noted

thatSenator Dodd was a member of the senate Internal

Security Subcommittee which twice conducted hearings on

the FPCC®

The December

27, 1963, edition of "The New York

World Telegram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro Castro

FPCC was seeking to go out of business and that sis prime

activity during its lifetime had been sponsorship of

Castro street rallies and mass picket lines,

and the

direction of an active propaganda mill highlighting illegal

travel-to Cuba campaigns. Its comparatively brief span of

life was attributed to mounting anti Castro American public

opinion,

the 1962 Congressional hearings which disclosed

FPCC financing by Castro's United Nations Delegation, and

ultimately, the bad publicity which the FPCC received from

disclosure of activities on its behalf by suspected

presidential

assassin Lee H. Oswald,

On February

6, 1964, the previously mentioned

second source advised that V.

I, lee had recently remarked that t

the FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to organize

another similar organization.

On April 13, 1964,

& third source advised that

there had not been any FPCClactivity in many months and

that the FPCC had been dissolved.

Attention: Mr. S. J. Papich

FROM

Deputy Director for Plans

see: sir, Rider 101-5077

1. A usually reliable source had reported the

following

summary of his conversation in London in late December 1964 with

Richara GIBSON, a free-lance writer, former Chairman of the Fair

Play for Cuba Committee and former editor of the English 'edition

of Révolution. GIBSON, a very light-skinned American negro

married to an Englishwoman, was working in the Columbia Broadcast

ing System (CBS) newsroom when along with another colleague, Robert.

Yoder, he established the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in the early

1960's. GIBSON was in Cuba several times in 1961 and had met Fidel

Castro Ruz and Ernesto Guevara Serna, and various other Cuban

officials.

2. Richard GIBSON

stated that he knew quite well Robert

Williams the American Negro from Monroe, North Carolina, who ha

emigrated to Cuba and now seems to commute between there and Peiping,

China.

According to GIBSON, he felt that the situation among Amer

ican

negroes (from

what he could tell in Europe) was becoming. very

dangerous.: He said that he had met in both London and Paris quite

few

young American negroes in their late teens passing through en

route to Prague, Czechoslovakia or Habana, Cuba for guerrilla anal

sabotage training. He further said he had the feeling that within

six months to a year these trainees would begin infiltrating back y

into the United States in pursuance of Williams' idea of an urban

guerrilla movement.
