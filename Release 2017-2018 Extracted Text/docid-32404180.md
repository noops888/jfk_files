Chief, Latin America Division

Release of Information on Mexico City Teltaps

Latin America Division is concerned that release of

information on Mexico City Station teltaps in conjunction with

the JFK Assassination Record Collection Act of 1992 could have

significant adverse impact on current Mexico City Station

operations. The specifics of that concern are outlined in the

attached document.

SUBJECT: Release of Information on Mexico City Teltaps

1. Protection of sources and

methods and liaison equities

require that references to the Mexico City Station teltap

activity be excised from any documents released under the

auspices of the JFK Assassination Record Collection Act of 1992.

While the teltap activity mentioned in the documents under review

occurred some thirty plus years ago, the joint teltap operation

with Mexican liaison has never been terminated; it continues to

this day in a slightly different form.

2. Release of any information that would constitute

official USG acknowledgment of the existence of the joint teltap

operation would have a

serious adverse impact on current

operations.

Relations between the Station and the liaison

service would be affected, with the likely outcome of

discouraging liaison from cooperating in similar ventures in the

future with Mexico City Station.

Official acknowledgment of the

existence of the joint teltap in the 1960's would embarrass the

liaison service given Mexico's strong brand of nationalism and

sensitivity towards the issue of sovereignty vis a vis the United

The service probably would terminate its cooperation

with the Station on the current joint teltap operation in order

to be able to defend itself against domestic critics.
