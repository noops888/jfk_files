10. With respect to the attempt on President Kennedy, when she

heard the news she became depressed and thought that the author was

some maniac and when she know that it was an element of "The Fair

Play for Cuba', she did not bdleve it at first. During Preaident Kennedy's

visit to Mexico, she did not attend any of the functions that were held in

his honor and did not otherwise participate. In talklag with her husband

when they learned of the assassination she sald it could have been done by

radicals and when Lee Harvey OSWALD entered into the discuasion, she

recognlied him as the same person that had come to the Cuban Consulate

about two months previous to requent a tranalt visa to Rusala.

and the circumstances of his visit le.. he was married to a Ruslan and

sald he belonged to the "Fal. Play for Cuba", that she checked his data in

the Consulate's archives and she was then sure that it was the same person.

That he is blond, short, poorly dressed. that his face gets red when he

talks; that he was denied a visa because the Consul told him that in order

to obtaln one he would first need a visa from the Russlan Consulate and this

procedure would take about four months and urged OSWALD to leave

Mexico. OSWALD became angry and for this reason she had to call the

Consul with whom he had an argument.

That OSWALD was told that the

ald which could be glven to him was to advise hira to go to the Russian Con-

sulate. The Consul then spoke by telephone to the person in charge of that

office, and was informed that the case would have to be referred to Moscow

and that there would be a four month delay. That In the afternoon of the

same day Lee Harvey OSWALD returned to the Cuban Consulate and that

she conflimed that he would only be given a visa when he had one from the

Russian Consulate giving hins, on a plece of paper, her name Silvia DURAN

with the office telephone numbet but that OSWALD was not given her address

since he had no reason to have It. That It was not her place to telephone

the Russian Consulate and ll she did it was in an official form and to help

Lee OSWALD In the Interent of performing her duties. That lf she gave

him her telephone number lt was no that he could later ask ll the visa had

been obtained, but he never called again.
