PERSHINGGERVAIS, PCI and

former investigator for the

Parish of Orleans, advised that GARRISON is obsessed with the

investigation into the assassination of President KENNEDY.

GERVAIS stated he told GARRISON to forget the matter and he

would not assist GARRISON in the investigation and was not

interested in anything GARRISON was doing in connection with

this investigation. He stated he has no knowledge of what

GARRISON is attempting to prove and the only contact he has

had with the investigation has been a call he received from

DAVID FERRIE. He stated that FERRIE has been trying to get

him, GERVAIS, to arrang

an interview with GARRISON, which

he has declined to do.

informant that JACK SMARTIN. and JOSEPH NEWBROUGH, both former

associates of BANISTEE,

been interviewed.

apparent that IVON was attempting to develop facts which would

tend to indicate that a conspiracy orginated in New Orleans

involving Cuban Nationals and OSWALD for the purpose of

assassinating President KENNEDY.
