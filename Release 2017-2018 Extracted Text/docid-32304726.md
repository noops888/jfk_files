DATE: 71-14-2017

It was determined that MICHELE MIRANDA

had not been in S. Giuseppe Vesuviano for many years

and did not maintain correspondence with his rela-

tives there.

The records of the Police Department, Naples,

reflect that MICHELE MIRANDA, SOn Of GIUSEPPE

AMBROSIO,

daughter of FRANCESCO and GIUSEPPA AMMIRATI,

born August 10, 1898, in S. Giuseppe Vesuviano, both

U.S. citizens,.

lodged at the Hotel Oriente in Naples

in August, 1963.

They departed on August 21, 1963,

enroute to Rome.

It was determined, however, that the MICHELE

MIRANDA mentioned in the records of the Naples Police

Department

, is not identical with the captioned

MICHELE MIRANDA.
