He said that

this wos so obvious from abrnad thät he just wondered why he

over had worried about incidents and didn't realize that it

was the "system" that mattered.l

He told about some of the discussions he had had with

leftist Mexican intellectuals en these points

had gotten the better of him at that point) with the statement

"My philosophy on this point

Reference: DIR 67851

Action

Required: rYI

Forwerded berewith is the referenced amendment

Ectard G. TICHORN's contract which provides for a one year

extension effective 19 November 1964 and a compensation

increase from $0,000 to $12,000.

During Subject's recent TDY. 1u Hashington it was

ande clear

to him that

this substantial pay raise and extension

of his contract. waa.on

the basis that TICHORN continue to

devote 85 to 90% of his time to KUBARK activity,

In view of

the fact that Bubject iu currently handling only one

project for

the Station, please explein to him that in the event

that his work

load reverts to the 50 to 65% level, he cannot

expect to continue

to receive the present anoubt of 'compensation.

During Subject's

talks at Headquarters, it appeared tint

TICHBORN uoderstanda this most clearly.

As a contract agent,

he is refinerated ou the basis of services rendered,

In return

for this arrangement, the government makes no claim on incono

he might racetve iron bis private bustness activities.

Obviously

it is our hope that coupled with the occasional full-time

assignments in other Wil countries levied on TICHBORN, that the

Station will bo able to continue to utilize Subject's services

at the high level of activity which will Justify his current

compensation.

Dear Fr.. Thomes:

Due to increeeed demands non my time fron other clients;

I find it necessery to relinquish my duties

and I do so with preet reluctence..

One of ny tieretofore-lesser

clients has recently expended his

activities in certain real estete developrents

thereby necessitating" frequent absence

Thẹn, too, I had underestinated

the grount

of time and effort required to satisfactorily attend the various

legel and easinistrative mattere

should you

so desire, I could recommend other legal counsel;

but I on

inclined to feel thet the

principal problens would be

of an geministrative nature rather then a legal one

Rey I thank you again for your confidonce and good will in

heving choser me es legal counsel for your ore nization's activities

I shall be happy to give you a personal report of my.

.J.. Taking all the foregoing

into consideration and to avoid complications wich

ho present projects or TICHBORN, the Station asked him what understanding ho.

had op the proportiou of his rue

to be dovoted to KUBARK activicles.

Ho anid

chae hie presens. contract was predicated on approximacely 60 co 66-2/38 of

his time being utilized by XUBARK. Hia present estimate to that he la devoting

85 to 90% of bie cine to KUBARK acidulties; and, if he la to do che kind of job

chạt la desfred on che l

projects recently acquired, he vill

sustain chat percentago.

Of couroe, he continues to be available for appropriate

assignmente

(such as FÜASPEN) in other councrios from elma

to cine; but, it has to be recognised that when be is abseat

chlo representa 1007 of bie time.

1. The Station agreco with his analysis on currert commitments againat his

tima on behalf of KUBARK.

should b pare us To a ter had eaten to Cleo the he

nakes his late October trip to PBPRIME l

and that the Station would request Headquartors to be

prepared to discusa the matter de chat time. It is the Stacion's understanding

that his present contract extension espires 19 November 1964.

5.

The Station would like to emphasize that this matter was brought up at ito

Initiative in

order to

try. (n) to assure that demands being placed on TICHBORN

recently could be reasonably expected to be fulfilled and (b) co get a complete

understanding on all aspects of TICHBORN's contractual status fritien and

unwritter) so that neither the Scation nor TICHBORN get commicted to these

continuing activities and suddenly find themselves in contention about the

tIre/salary involved. It should also be emphastsed chac TICHBORN D99 ROC

complained about recent requiremonts, but has devoted whatever time required

to handle them and do the job expected.

Tichborns ortginal contract provided for travel on an actual.

expense basts. This was when he was working on a dally or Job

rate basis.

This contract was terminated and a new contract was written

no 1961 as vet 8,000 per easy a the pen de lat

lleú of subsistence."

None of Tichkorn's travel claims have been processed since the

new contract has been effective.

All travel clains submitted by

hia, starting in June 1961 have been sübmitted on an actual expense

basis.

Finance

takes the view that the "This may include per diem---"

restricting Tichborn to per diem only plus of course operational

expenses.

Processing Tichborns old accounts on this basis would.

require him to refund several hundred dollars.

An amendment to the contract would take care of these old

accounts as subnitted:

Options:

-1.

3:

Get refund from Tichborn

Ammend contract to cover actual expenses to present

date.

Ammend contract to cover actual expenses past and

future.
