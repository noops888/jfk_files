THE CUBANS AN EXCUSE FOR NOT EVACUATING THE MEXICANS IMPLICATED

SANCTUARY IN CUBA TO AVOID ARREST. CURDELO INDICATED THAT THE

CUBANS WERE VERY FEARFUL FOR CUBAN-MEXICAN RELATIONS IN VIEW OF

THE RICO GALAN CASE AND DID NOT WANT TO BE ACCUSED BY THE MEXICANS

OF GRANTING ASYLUM TO GUILTY PARTIES.

: ASKED WHY HE DID NOT DO MORE IN CULTURAL PRESS WORK FOR CUBA, LOPEZ

ASSISTING THE REVOLUTIONARY FORCES IN MEXICO, (SOURCE COMMENT:

LOPEZ IS PROBABLY A SECURITY OR INTELLIGENCE REPRESENTATIVE AT

THE CUBAN EMBASSY, SINCE HE IS VERY CLOSE TO RICO GALAN AND AP

PEARED TO FEEL THAT THE MEXICANS CONNECTED WITH THE CASE WHO HAD

NOT YET BEEN ARRESTED SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN PASSAGE TO CUBA.)

1. PRELIMINGRY RESULIS OF AN INVESTIGATION BY MEXICAN

SECURITY OFFICIALS OF THE 14 AUGUST EXPLOSION AND FIRE IN THE

PEMEX REFINERY AT POZA RICA, VERACRUZ, HAVE REVEALED NO EVIDENCE

TO INDICATE DHO MIGNI BE RESPONSIDLE FOR THE EXPLOSION.

INVESTIGATION IS HAMPERED BY THE FACT THAT SECURITY PRE-

CAUTIONS AT THE REFLUERY ARE ALMOST NONEXISTENT. AT THE :

TIME OF THE EXPLOSION OULY ONE GATE GUARD AND TWO SOLDIERS

WERE ON DUTY IN THE ENTIRE PLANT.

Zo THE CONDITION OF THE SECIION OF THE GAS TRANSMISSION

LINE WHERE THE FIRST EXPLOSION OCCURED INDICATES THAT THE

LINE WAS RUPTURED BY AN OUTSIDE EXPLOSION SINCE THE EDGES OF

THE PIPE AT THE POINT OF RUPTURE WERE TURNED INWARD.

3. THE EXPLOSION OCCURED AT A TIME WHEN MAXIMUM PROPERTY

DAMAGE AND MINIMUM LOSS OF LIFE WERE ASSURED. (SOURCE COMMENT:

HAD THE BLAST AND FIRE OCCURED DURING THE WORK WEEK IT IS PROBABLE

THAT AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED PERSONS WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.)

4. (SOURCE COMMENT: THE CONDITION OF THE PIPE LINE AND

THE TINING OF THE EXPLOSION STRONGLY SUGGEST SABOTAGE. ALSO,

THE DAMAGE IS MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE THAN THE PRESS HAS INDICATED

AVD IT WILL PROBABLY TAXE MUCH LONGER TO GET THE REFINERY BACK •

IN OPERATION THAN HAS BEEN ESTIMATED. RESERVES ARE BEING USED

NOW TO PREVENT A GASOLINE SHORTAGE.)

apparent that these contacte are primarily for the purpose of channeling VRG'a

reports and intructions to and from Cuba. In the course of his work as an

agant for Castro and the DGI, VRG le known to have actod as a courier, carrying

material and largo sume of money to pro-Cuban groupe in Central and Latin

American countries.

In October 1964 VRG raceived another important abaignment from hle

Cuban mastera. VRG was sequestod to travel to Guatomala to make a personal

survey of the atrength and weaknessos of Marco Antorio Yon Suba's guerrilla

forcea and to lay the basis for a more energetic Implemontation in Guatemala

of the tactical principles for guerrilla warfare laid down by "Che" Guevars.

This was, In effect, a follow-up to his varliar vioit to Yon Soon during his

swing through Contral American countries in late 1963. At that timo, VRG

attemptod lo parouado Yon Sosa to allen himself more closaly with Castro's

objactivos in intin America. The rosulto of this viole to Guatemala vero

written up by VRG in a spoctal report to Castro, VRG's concludions at that

tirno more not complately favorable lo cartro,

Yon Sosa is knoun to bo a forcoful and Indopendant guerrilla loader who

prides himsell on hia ability to maintain nlineeli and his followera independantly

of ideological pedance from sither Havana, Pakiug or Moacow, although he la

quito willing to accept arms ani financial support from any of these Communiat

capitals. In tha gist Castro's elforto to bring Yon Sona to hoel hava boas

thwarted malaly by cha incluonce the Chinosa Communists have bean able to

exert over the Guaterialan guerrlila leadar. In addition to the direct aid

provided by Paking to Yon Soda and his guerrillas in Northodstora Cuazumala,

thore da the faci of Yon Soon'a Chinose background (Yon Sosa'a father as

Chinese) which has sorved to tie him emotlonally to the Red Chinese.

It was the continuing recalcitrant abiitude di Xon Sora which appareutly

prompled VRG'a second intaoion to Guatemala in October of 1964. VAG wa

Included in these tapes was ono made by VRG for delivery to the

guerrillas during his oarly October viole with them. A copy of thia tapo la

attached. The tape constate mainly of an oxhortation by VRG for unity (between

tho Perildo Guatemaltoco del Trabale (PGT) and the 13 November Group)

and a plas not to permit ideological argumants to replaco action. In this speech

VRG reveala himsell to be a hard-headed rovolutionary activiot, not merely an

Intellectual loitiot, His approach to revolation is completely prnctical, not the -

oretical.
