At 7:05 p.m., an unknown female entered the room and

the name RUTH BROWN was

mentioned. While the television wAs

on, BUFALINO and the unsub talked about record productions and he

nentioned that IRVING was going to California in two weeks.

Je and the unsub also talked about the union and the AGPA (ph).

The female formerly entertained at the Town Hill Club (ph)

and she had a record which was currently on the market. However,

the name was not mentioned.

was working at the Baly Grand Club (ph) in Brooklyn.

During their conversation, the subject received a

phone call at 7:16 p.M. and he said that he was busy and leaving

SOOn.

He told the caller that IRVING manages name groups such as the

Hurricanes, DELL SHANON (ph), etc.

After the caller hung up, BUFALINO identified him as

MARK ALLEN (ph) and he described him as a fag.

The name of BUFALINO's female companion sounded like

"Birdie Green" (NYO indices negative).

After the subject and GREEN apparently engaged in

sexual activities, they left the room at 8:55 pom. and there was

no further activity.

The only activity reported by the source on 5/8/62 was

a call made at 9 p.m. to an unsub female and the room occupant

asked her to come over.

She indicated she could not and the occupant

apparently spent the rest of the time in the room listening to

television. At 1l pam., he left the room and there was no further

activity.

in 7/26/62, PCI TOM LANNIGAN advised SA JOHN B. MEADE

that the subect or his

associates have not stopped at the hotel

recently and he has received no reservation request from the

subject.

to the effect that BUFALINO was in the hotel or planning

to come to the hotel, he would notify the NYo.
