exists coneiderable opportunity for activity in

Follyrood. Our payments per month, aside fron

overhoad, anount to over $650.00 and the help of

Hollywood is decidedly needed in raining this quota.

I indioated that discussion was still going on con-

corning baale pointe of the Hollywood report end I

think I oar prophosy that basie points of the holly-

mood report will be adoptod as our polioy.

coinoides with much that vas already said here that

was not refloctod in any offiotal communication. One

misgiving about the report is that somo of the mombers

are not entirely convinced that Hollywood intende to

continue aotivity in a serious vay. The basis for.

this bellot is that so far we have seen no dues fron

lollywood.

What is Hollywood doing about that problen?

In your letter of Decembor 22nd you askod what our

polloy was of collaboration with othor refugoe com-

mittoes. No are not st present engagod in any joint

project.

No were considering taking part in a joint

projoot at the outbreak of the war but withdrew on the

following ground, (1) that the collaboration tendod

to inoreasa our obligatione to a great extent and

without any certalaty that income would koep pace

with our obligations. (2) that collaboration in the

past had had the offoot of outting down the amount

of money wo might have had had we run them alone.

(3) that the possibility of using funde for the

transportation of refugco vritero f'ron France has

practically coused to exist."

It would appoar that this lotter was in the neture of a

direstive and statement ofthe continuing polloy of the Loague of

Anerivan Writers, since it tu noted that FRED RINALDO, member of

the Hollywood Chapter, appeared at the Communiat Farty Sponsor

World Forum, 2200 West 7th Street, Los Angoles on Sunday, January

18, 19h2 and lestured on the subjoot "Hollywood and the World."

This is the first soreen writer to appear on this forum since 1t

started some monthe ago.

Furthor cooperation of the local chapter

and the rolation of subjoot iASON to the I.L.D., the I.W,0, und

the Refugee Writer Groups will be followed in this investigation

The attention of the Bureau 1e furthor invitod to the

roport of CNDI LA #20-1 dated January 3, 1942, which advines that

this Infoment has recoliod Information fron a confidential rollable

source to the offoot that there is a steady flow of subrorsive date
