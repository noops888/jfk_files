(92-27124)

(92-444)

ReBuartel 3/27/62 requesting developments re BRUNO's

contact with Phila. Municipal Judge ADRIAN BONNELLY.

Information originally developed re BRUNO's contact

with BONNELLY was through PH 623-6*.

From PH 269-C it was as-

certained that BRUNO's associate MITCHELL COHEN did not go to

Florida where BONNELLY is known to be vacationing: COHEN, ac-

cording to this informant, is closely associated with BONNELLY.

It was apparent COHEN was being used to contact Judge BONNELLY.

Inasmuch as COHEN did not travel to Miami for possible

rendezvous with BRUNO and ultimate meeting with Judge BONNELLY,

no open inquiries were made Phila. re BONNELLY's address in

Florida.

PH 623-C* indicates BRUNO returned Phila. 3/23 or 24/62

and since return has not' mentioned any meetings in Miami.

Phila. will be alert for any further developments re

BRUNO's activities while in Florida and will keep the Bureau ad-

vised.

BRUNO CONSIDERED DANGEROUS.
