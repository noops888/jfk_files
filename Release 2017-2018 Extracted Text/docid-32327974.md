Re: Itko Shipping Corporation

a Japanese yacht butlding company named Itko Shipping Corporation.

On the basis of the purchase agreement, Intercontinental SOldJAPAN

these yachts before they physically had possession. Subsequently,

on this deal. GRANELLO and COOPER are suing Itko and FRED

BALIN, a reputable New York attorney, is representing Teko.

PEARLMAN and set up a meeting between BALIN and Judge SCHWEITZER,

a New York County Criminal Court Justice, who is handling this

NY

matter.

Source learned from PEARLMAN that BALIN and SCHWEITZER -

have met and have agreed on a settlement between Intercontinental

and Itko. As a result of the settlement, part of the payment

received. by Intercontinental will be returned to BALIN and Judge

SCHWEITZER in the form of a kickback. (It should be noted that

information concerning this matter was furnished by airtel

dated 4/24/63 and information obtained in this matter on

4/30/63 is at some variance with information previously obtained.

The source was questioned concerning this variance and advised

that he received the information from SAL GRANELLO in a rather

disjointed manner on the first occasion but now believed that

the information presently being furnished is acourate in every

detail.)
