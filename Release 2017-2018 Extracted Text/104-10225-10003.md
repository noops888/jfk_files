MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, Clandestine Services Career

Service Panel

SUBJECT

: Reconimendation for Promotion of Mr.

Joseph S. Plccolo .

It Is recommended that Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo be promoted

from GS-7 to G6-8. He has been in grade GS-7 since 19 July 1960

and was assigned to what is now the Special Alfairs Stall (formerly

Task Force T) on 27 August 1962.

%. As long ago as 16 June 1960 when he was a GS-6 Mr. Plecolo

was considered to have merited promotion to GS-9, but an Agency

policy precluding multiple grade promotions prevented his being con-

sidered for G8-9 at that time. He was promoted to GS-7 on 19 July

1960. On 4 May 1961 Mr. Piccolo was recommended for promotion

to GS-8 at a time when he was expected to leave the Agency in order

to comply with his obligation for military service.

The rocommendation

was not approved on the grounds that promotion spaces were limited.

Mr. Piccolo served in the Air Force between 4 October 1901 and

27 August 1992 when he returned to the Agency and began working in

the Cl Branch of the Special Affairs Staff.

3.

Mr. Piccolo has demonstrated an aptitude for CI and FI

operations and is one of the most promising younger men in the CI

Branch. His performance since returning from military service has

been supertor in all respects.

11.

I am happy to recommend Mr. Piccolo for promotion.

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY...

WASHINGTON 25, D. G.

Applicant Information

Sheet No. 1

To all persons applying for employment.

with the Central Intelligence Agency:

This paper is the first step in applying for employment or consultant

Blatus with the Central Intelligence Agency.

No applicition may proceed

beyond this first step if the applicant is not in agreement with the

conditions stated below:

General Considerations:

1. The National Security Act of 26 July 1947 (Public Law 253, 80th

Congress) which created the Central Intelligence Agency places upon the

Agency the responsibility:

á, "40 advise the National Security Council in matters concerning

such intelligence activities of the Guvernment departments and agencies

as relate to the national security;

b. "to make recommendations to the National Security Council

for the coordination of such intelligence activities of the depart-

ments and agencies of the Government as relate to the national

security;

c. "to correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to the

national security, and provide for the appropriate dissemination

of such intelligence within the Government. . . ;

d. "90 perform, for the benefit of the existing intelligence

agencies, such additional services of common concern as the National

Security Council determines can be more efficiently accomplished

centrally;

e. "to perform such other functions and duties related to

intelligence affecting the national security as the National Security

Council may from time to time direct."

---

## Page 91

14-00000

The special character

of this national responsibility requires the Agency

to maintain correspondingly speci.. employment criteric which may be

different from the routine or normal employment standards of other Govern-

ment departments and agencies which do noe hire the highly sensitive res-

ponsilmlity borne by the Control Intelligence Agency. le follows that the

Investigation of applicanes, prerequisite lo their acceplance do i time-

consuning process which, in addition to loyalty and security checks,

includes evaluation of competence, physical and emotional fitners, nd

avallability of a suitable position at such pime as employment may be offered.

This la called "clearance" of an applicant.

2. Investigation of an applicant may reveal something which prevents

his clearance - perhaps something of which the applicant is genuinely unaware,

perhape something which only the special employment criteria of the Agency

make unacceptable. In ony event, adverse findings by the Agency are con-

clusive and final so far as the Agency is concerned, und no statement of

specific reasons is made 8o the applicant.

3. Employment by the Central Intelligence Agency is nut i right upon

which an applicant can insise. Offer of employment which is subject to full

clearance does not constitute a commitment on the Agency's part giving an

unsuccessful ipplicant grounds for any claim against the Agency, Acceptance

of employment upon the condition of clearance is at the applicant's risk,

taken with the knowledge that i very substantial percentage of applicants

are not cleared.

Stitsinent of Understanding

and Agreement

I have read, understand, and agree to the foregoing General Consid

erations. If not accepted for employment by the Central Intelligence

Agency, I will make no claim or demand in conflict with those consid-

erations.

I have also seen and read Ayplicant Information Sheet No. 2.

Subject really shone in his performance.

He was obliged to

deal with the most difficult

ever encountered by

rater, and represented and protected Station interests

and dignity.

Subject requires little supervision, by virtue of his

thorough

knowledge and extensive experience in practically

every aspect of the mechanics of clandestine operations in

Latin Anerica.

His avocation is "Administration"

sense of the word, and he administers his work load impeccably.

The assignment just completed nas his first command job.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS (Continued)

If forced to scarch for a deficiency in his performane

over the past fourteen months under my supervicion,

it would

be necessary to point to a weak showing in operational and

particularly he could have spons more

and other

purposes.

In his regular work hours, however,

which included some nights and weekends, he wis more than

gainfully employed in the accomplishment of his assigned

duties. He is not a clock-watcher, but stays with the

Jas well as with the paperwork until they

are completed.

This Officer is the victim of personnel requirements,

which has resulted in an Organizational follure to challenge

his talents and ingenuity.

His re-assignment to the Cuban

Operations Section next, for example, will be his fifth

assignment in that arca

In 15 years.

It is recommended that

he obtain rotational experience in another geogriphical or

furictional area, to broaden him.

Although employee expressed a desire to work in operations at that time, he

agreed to periorm the duties outlined in Section B. He was called upon to

perform these dutles because of the dire need within TFW/CI for someone

with his talents to establish and manage Branch systems for mall routing-

control and Miles.

Employee was promised an operational assignment ag

Employee has performed his dutiee exceptionally well

and has established systoms for mall routing-control, and files for the

Branch which are functioning well. It is strongly recommended that this

eniployee be assigned to duttes of an operational nature and relieved from

his present dutles as soon as possible. Employee has the capability of assuming

the following:

1.

Mr. Piccolo attended the Sentor Operations Course from 3 November

to 12 December 1975 (SOC 02/76).

Individual student grader and class rankings.

have not been

used to evaluate arudent performance.

The diverse background of

che students and the nature of the course materint used in the Soc preclude

formal testing.

This memorandum atteats to Mr. Plecolo's satisfactory comple

tion of the course.

2. During che six weeks of the course, 59% of che time was devoted to

aublects and activitles directly related to operations, Including 30% devoted

officers

in the class ranged in grade from CS-12 to CS-14

(averige grade 12.9), nverage age was

43,6 (Mr. Plecolo's ago la 40).

SUBJECT: Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo - Completion

of

Senior Operations Course 82/76

4. Mr. Piccolo, as a 40-year-uld 65-13/4, was at about the average age

for this class ond slightly above nverage in grade.

Although formal grades

are not siren to graduates of the SoC, It was the consensus of DTS state

Instructors Involved in SOC 12/76 that Mr. Piccolo would almost certainly

rank number one in this particular group.

Bringing to the class broad opera-

Elonal expertence and understanding, Mr. Piccolo was an active pareicipans in

One of the Course Coordinators commented that Mr. Piccolo, "exhibited, more

than any of the others, the ability to lead the group." Mr. Piccolo's term

paper on the subject l

was eareful and thorough and was deseribed by the panel as "an excellent overall

plan " To a man of Mr. Piccolo"s experience, at least some of the course may

have seemed a litcle basic or redundant, but he never let it show, and always

took pare with the sane enthustaem as the more junior members of the class.

A copy of this memorandum la being placed in Mr. Piccolo'a official

personnel file.
