NOTE FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

FROM:

SUBJECT:

Jeffrey H. Smith

General Counsel

Response to Senator Specter's Request Concerning

Information to be Released Under the JFK Act

1.

You asked me to obtain information to assist you in

responding to the questions from Senator Specter.

Senator

Spector asked whether there was any information or documents to

be released by CIA under the President John F. Kennedy

Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (JFK Act) :

a.

concerning Oswald's connection(s) to foreign powers

not previously disclosed; and

concerning Oswald's connection(s) to foreign powers

that CIA did not give to the Warren Commission.

2. My staff has checked with the Historical Review Group

(HRG), which is the component of the Center for the Study of

Intelligence that is processing the JFK collection under the JFK

Act, regarding these

two questions. Here is their response.

a .

Response to Question 1:

There is no information

to be

disclosed that links Oswald to any foreign powers

other than those previously released (Cuba, USSR). However,

there will be additional details made public about these

contacts.

For instance, the Russian intelligence officer

who met with Oswald in Mexico City has written a book that

has information not previously known to CIA.

Also, under

the progressive declassification standards of the JEK Act,

many details on Oswald's activities have been declassified

and released (and the JFK Board may release more) .

b. Response to Question 2: The HRG is unaware that

any of this information was not previously shared with the

Warren Commission.

However, it is possible that there may

be some additional details or some specific documents that

the Warren Commission did not have.

(FYI, The House Select

Committee on Assassinations' report indicated that the

information CIA had not shared with the Warren Commission

related to assassination plots against Castro, not to

Oswald's activities.

3.

In order to identify with precision any new details or

documents that may be released as a result of the JEK Act, the

HRG would have to

review the Warren Commission Report, then

compare the specific documents provided to the Warren Commission

with the documents in the collection to see if there is any

difference.

Such a review and comparison would require the HRG

to dedicate a couple of reviewers to the task for a significant

period of time and inhibits its ability to complete the

processing required by the JFK Act.
