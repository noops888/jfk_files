that you had in mind.was not that Maurice Bishop?

He might very well have been involved in this thin!

Mr. Goldsmich. Getting back to Mr. Bishop, when was the

first time you saw him to the best of your memory?

I would think about the early Sixties.

Mr. Goldsmith. Were you ever formally introduced to him?

Mr. Eiderigo No.

Mx. Goldsmith. And from the time that you first saw him

in the early Sixties until the last time that you saw him,:

which I believe you said would have been about 1969 or 1970,

approximately how many tines did you actually see this man?

Mr. Hidalgo? It would not have been that lace because ir

late 1964 or early 1965 I left the Cuban operations and went t

another country of interest, so in those times, say 1950 to

1964, it might have been two or three times.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it fair to say in light of your last

comment that once you stopped working in Cuban operations, you

left that particular area, you no longer saw Mt. Bishop?

Mr. Elidaigo It I did, it would be just in the hallway

Mr. Hidalgo! I don't know that. He may hava known him

but I don't know that.

Mr. Goldsmich. Is it possible that the name Maurice

Biship may have been an alias?

Mr. [lidalgo] Very possible.

Mx. Goldsmith. Why do you say that?

Mr. Hidalgo] Because others in the agency thought chat

they knew me by X name and they called me by that name when in

fact it was not.

Mr. Goldsmith. So the use of aliases even at agency

headquarters was not at all uncommon, is that true, to your

Knowledge?

Mr. Goldsmith. Did Mr. Bishop have any involvement in ti

affairs of the brigade? By brigade I am not referring to the

Bay of Pigs operation.

MI®

I don't know it he did. I was not aware

everyone. He might very vell have been involved in this thin:

Mr. Goldsmith. Getting back to Mt. Bishop, when was the

first time you saw him to the best of your memory?

I would think about the early Sixties.

Mr. Goldsmith. Were you ever formally introduced to him:

Mr.

NO.

Mx. Goldsmith. And from the time that you firsc saw him

in the early Sixties until the last time that you saw him,

which I believe you said would have baen about 1969 ox 1970,

approximately how many times did you actually see this man?

MI.

.. It would not have been that late because ir

late 1964 or early 1965 I left the Cuban operations and went t

another country of interest, so in those times, say 1950 to

1964, it might have been two or three times.

Mx. Goldsmith. Is it fair to say in light of your last

comnent that once you stopped working in Cuban operations, you

left that particular area, you no longer saw Mi. Bishop? .

MI.

• If I did, it would be just in the hallway

and I don't think so. I was now in another pait of the agency

to seck them out and say, "How are you, dave? How are you

It sounds peculiar.

I

I was assigned

there shortly after I went there and met my own cover and did

my own operations,

So when I did go to the

station,

it was just a matter of just quickly in and gat it ovet with.

Mr. Goldsmith, Did you ever see Mt. Bishop's picture in

the newspaper?

Whom someone told me, "That is Maurice

at this time. I may have a few. follow-up guestions., If the

cormittee has questions, I will yield at this time.

MI. Preyer. All right.

Mt. Fithian.

Mr. Fithian. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Do you get any feel for whether other people that you get

to see just casually at the CIA are - I don't know how to put

this - higher or lower on the pecking order?

Mr.

Pardon?

Mr. Fithian. Do you have a feel for an individual that

you see casually over at the agency as to whether or not they

are higher up in the structure?

Mr. Fithian. Yes.

You mean when I was working at the agency

Yes, I think i know what you are trying to

I would say he was a higher grade than I wa

Of course I was not a very high grade.

Mr. rithian. That is the only question I had, Mt. Chair-

inars.

Mr. Preyer. Was your office in tangley in the CIA head-

quarters?

MI.

• Yes. At the time I was in headquarters.

That is where I went.

MI. Preyer. And Dave Phillips' office was also there?

Mr. Preyer.

And :: Maurice Bishop's office was not on

the same floor as yours in langley?

• MI:

I don't know.

It was a very large floor

and there were many people on the floor that had nothing to

do with what I had to do.

Mr. Pteyer. Did Bishop have some relationship in his

appearance and age to Phillips?

MI.

Again I cannot recall Bishop's appearance

at all.

Mr. Preyer. Do you recall more on the name when people

said, "That is Maurice Bishop"?

I have a few more questions for you, Me.

Do you know whether David Phillips Knew Maurica Bisho

I don' know that. He may have known h

Mx.-

but I don't know that.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it possible that the name Maurice

Biship may have been an alias?

MI.

Very possible.

Mr. Goldsmith. Why do you say that?

MX.

• Because others in the agency thought th

they knew me by X name and they called me by that name whe

fact it was not.

Mr. Goldsmith.

So the use of aliases even at agency

headquarters was not at all unconmon, is that true, to you

knowledge?

Mx.

That is true.
