Thomas Parrott/background.

Parrott joined the CIA in 1949 and was first assigned to the

Office of Policy Coordination (OPC). His entire service in the

Agency has been in the Clandestine Services. During the period

1950 through 1951, he was the CIA staff officer responsible to the

"designated representatives," the group that had been set up under

NCS-10/2 to review covert operations. He was Chief of Base in

Frankfurt, Germany unt11 late summer of 1957. At that time, he

was brought back to Washington to serve as a CIA staff officer on

duty to the Operations Coordinating Board. In this assignment, he

dealt primarily with covert operations. When the Special Group be-

gan its weekly meetings in January, 1959, Parrott was assigned to

be the full-time staff member for the Special Group. He was, how-

ever, still primarily an assistant to Allen Dulles. He remained in

this position until 1963, when he left to join the intelligence

community staff where he stayed until 1972. He is now retired and

living in Washington.
