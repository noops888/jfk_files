SECRET

Any information obtained by the Miami Division

through interview of ANGEL SOLANO should be reported under

the UPUC caption in accordance with instructions contained

in referenced Bureau airtel dated November 16, 1961.

Rane Service, a Chicago detective agency and watchman

service, 510 North Dearborn Street, apparently has no connection

with this matter.

For the information of the Offices receiving copies

of this report, reference is being made to Miani letter to

the Director dated 11/14/61 entitled "JAMES WILLIAM BECK; ET AL,

CENTRAL AMERICAN DEMOCRATIC FRONT, IS - NICARAGUA; RA - NICARAGUA"

(00: Chicago) which contained therein a characterization of

SAUL SAGE who furnished the original information concerning this

matter.

IMM 639-S who has been involved in Cuban revolutionary

activities during the past four years and has furnished reliable

information in the past, advised on 9/5/61 that SAUL SAGE, an

American, had been frequenting the hang outs of Cuban

revolutionists in Miami, Florida.

MM 639-S stated that SAUL

SAGE is highly unreliable and psychotic and together with other

individuals thinks up irresponsible plans and dreams from day.

to day that have no chance of success and which they never

really intend to put into practice. SAGE and his associates

have no organizational ability, no money, are unemployed and

enjoy playing

the part of being considered "soldiers of fortune"

Careful consideration has been given to each source

concealed and T symbols were utilized only in thoseeinstances

where the identities of the sources must be ocealed.
