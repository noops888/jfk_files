ANGELO BRUNO, aka

AR

00: Phila.

Re New York teletype to Bureau 1/24/61 captioned

"MICHELINO CLEMENTE, AR,

Bufile 92-2866 and Phila. letters

to. Bureau, co New. York, 1/13/61 and 1/18/61, enclosing

con-

versation

re BRUNO and

ANTONIO POLLINA, aka, at Phila.

Noted Phila. letter of 1/13/61, page 25, BRUNC

mentions CARLO GABBINO (ph) and TOMMY BARREN (ph)

and it now

appears

in view of New York tel that BRUNO probably made

reference to CARLO GAMBINO and THOMAS LUCHESE, aka, TOMMY

courier for the Commission.

This is substantiated to a degree

by BRUNO's reference indicating he travels alone.

PH 269-C In November 1957 traveled to Miami, Fla,

with BRUNO and was present when

approximately 25 individuals,"

unknown to informant, visited BRUNO separately in Golden Nugget

Motel, Miami Beach,

and gave BRUNO money which filled a suitcase

and BRUNO thereafter returned with money to Phila. BRUNO told

informant "runners" weekly bring money to Phila. from Miami.
