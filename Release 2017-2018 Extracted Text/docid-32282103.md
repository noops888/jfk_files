SELECT COMMITTEE TO

STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH

RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

(PURSUANT TO S. RES. 21, PATH CONGRESS)

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20510

February 25, 1976

Mr. Walter Elder

Review Staff

Central Intelligence Agency

Langley, Virginia

Dear Mr. Elder:

This

is to confirm our discussion of February 20

regarding the deposition of certain requests of the Select

Committee:

(1) With regard to the Committee's letter of February 6,

and CIA's letter response 76-0200/1 of February 11, I asked

that a

further attempt be made to identify the initials

"G.N.N."

Those initials follow handwritten comments on

March 1965 document in the AMLASH file which proposed giving

the Cuban government information which might compromise

AMLASH.

(2) With regard to the Committee's letter of January

12 and CIA's letter response 76-0062/1 of February 11, I

asked that CIA review its files on Osvaldo Dorticos, Presi-

dent of Cuba, to determine if the message received by Dr.

Portell-Villa was placed in those files.

(3) Dan Dwyer and I reviewed the list of CIA person-

nel at the Mexico City, station referenced in CIA's letter 76-

0083/3 of February Il and agreed the list should remain at

the Agency.

(4) I requested the Select Committee be provided, the

current address and telephone number of Mr. Jolm Whiteny, the

Desk Chief for Mexico in 1963.

(5) With regard to the Committee's letter of January

29, requesting that two current Agency employees be made

available for interviews, we agreed the Agency should provide

the Committee a letter stating whether or not these employees

were readily available for interviews.

E's

Hit it.

CIA HAS NO OBJECTION TO

DECLASSIICATION AND/OR

RELEASE OF THIS DOCUMENT

AS SANITIZED

(6) Dan Dwyer and I reviewed Agency originated

documents in CIA'

s 201 File on Gilberto Policarpo Lopez

It is our understanding you would reconsider CIA's decision to

deny the Committee's

request for a copy of these documents:.

(7) With regard to the Committee's letter of January 30,

we agreed:

(a) We would for the time being narrow the request

in Daragraph 1 to include only contacts of Director McCone;

(b) We would not alter the requests in paragraphs

2 and 3.

I trust this summary accords with your understanding of

our discussion, but please let me know if there is any

misunderstanding.

Sincerely,

James phnston
