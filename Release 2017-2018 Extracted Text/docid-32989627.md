Interview of Donald E. Moore by

Mr. Loch Johnson, Senate Select Committee

July 28, 1975

;

Mr. Johnson stated at the outset that this was an informal

interview and he did not place me under oath. He asked about my

background which was provided him and included the fact that I

served in the FBI from March 10, 1941, until my retirement at

the end of June 1973.

The interview concerned the so-called Huston Committee

and he asked if I knew Tom Charles Huston before the Committee

was established. I said I recalled meeting Huston once, in Bill

Sullivan's office, but I didn't recall when this was, but it was before

the Committee was formed. In response to questions, Mr. Johnson

sas informed as follows:

I was aware of the meeting at the White House attended by

Director Hoover, Mr. Helms, Admiral Gayler and Gen. Bennett.

I was probably aware the meeting was to take place before the

meeting date but I can't recall this. (He said the meeting was

held June 5, 1970.) I was not at a meeting held in Mr. Hoover's

office June 8 but I recall hearing about the meeting, probably

from Bill Sullivan. I don't recall a meeting held in the Domestic

Intelligence Division after this at which Sullivan, Bill Cregar,

George Moore, Fred Cassidy and I were present. I did attend the

initial meeting of the Working Group headed by Sullivan and was

present because Sullivan asked me to be there. I remember Sullivan

and Cregar were at the meeting and I thought one or more other FBI

representatives were present.

He mentioned George Moore and

Fred Cassidy were at the meeting.

I recall Mr. Helms and Mr. Angleton from, CIA were present

but did not recall the names of others including the representatives

from NSA, DIA and the military services. I recall Sullivan chaired

the meeting and that Huston sat at the opposite end of the table.

Either Helms or Sullivan announced that Helms probably couldn't

stay for the entire meeting but I don't recall Helms leaving, although

he did not sit directly at the conference table.

## Page 18

I can't recall the conversation at the meeting but think that

Sullivan outlined the request of the President to study means of

getting better intelligence information on new left activities and

violent protest movements in the US, especially with regard to

possible foreign support. I think Sullivan probably outlined areas

of concern and asked representatives present to document where they

felt intelligence was lacking, how it could be obtained, who should

obtain it and what was needed to obtain it. I said I couldn't at this

date recall specific observations or proposals and rather believed

the purpose of the meeting was to outline the general problem and

ask the representatives to document these and come in with specific

recommendations at a subsequent meeting. I am certain Mr. Huston

spoke about the purpose of the meeting but I can't recall his comments.

This was the only meeting of the Working Group I attended.

I told Mi. Suilivan that if agreeable with him I would not attend

subsequent meetings and I thought the FBI had several representatives

present and that the

thrust was on new left and related activities. As

I recall he said "suit yourself." Johnson pressed me on this and I

told him this was what I expressed to Sullivan but I also was somewhat

uneasy after the first meeting as I did not believe Mr. Hoover was

aware of collection efforts that were likely to be recommended. I

could not state what FBI members attended subsequent meetings but

I believe Charles Brennan and Bill Cregar, and of course, Bill

Sullivan, attended as well as some other representatives.

I can't say who drafted the report but was sure it was under

Sullivan's direction. During the period of the meetings Deke DeLoach

had retired and Sullivan had been appointed Assistant to the Director

and moved from the 9th & D Building to the Justice Building. I

don't recall when Mr. Hoover's objections to certain of the

recommendations were added.. I can't say whether I saw the report

prior to the objections being in it but may have; I do recall seeing

the report after the objections were in it. I don't know whether

Mr. Hoover told Sullivan to put the objections in it but presume

Sullivan knew Mr. Hoover's views and put the objections in on this

basis. I could not answer the question as to whether Mr. Tolson

was the person responsible for having the objections made but felt

he would have objected to the initial recommendations.

I did see the letter from the White House saying the report

had been approved. I believe it was signed by Huston and stated

the President had approved the recommendations. I was aware

Mr. Hoover had either written or seen Attorney General Mitchell

expressing his reluctance and was aware the White House letter was

withdrawn. I din't know why it was withdrawn other than this

occurred after Mr. Hoover went to the Attorney General.

Mr. Johnson asked certain specific questions during or

after the above discussion. He asked what covert mail coverage

was involved since CIA in 1970 was engaged in covert mail inter-

ception. After checking with Mr. Leon F. Schwartz of the FBI,

Mr. Johnson was advised that while I had been released from my

pledge of confidentiality by the FBI in general with regard to the

Huston Committee this matter was under review by the Department

of Justice and I had not been released from my pledge on this

aspect. A similar answer was given to the question about what

was meant by the removal of restrictions on the use of surreptitious

entry of embassies io obiain crypiographic maierials.

Mr. Johnson asked if I thought the Huston Committee had

been instigated by Bill Sullivan to more or less force Mr. Hoover

to take a more aggressive stance in intelligence collection. I

answered that I would not like to speculate on this and I could not

make a definite statement yes or no.

He asked why the Working Group met at CIA as opposed to

the FBI and whether this had special meaning. I answered that I

did not think so, that the US Intelligence Board was headed by the

Director of CIA, was concerned with intelligence collection and

met at CIA and also meeting arrangements could probably be better

arranged at CIA in view of parking, conference rooms, etc.

He said Admiral Gayler had stated that he and his predecessor,

Gen. Carter, had tried to get Mr. Hoover to provide more support to

NSA with regard to Communications Intelligence and asked if I was

aware of any such efforts, and if they were in person or in writing.

I said I was aware that Gen. Carter and Adm. Gayler had asked for

support and I believe they might have seen Mr. Hoover personally

and perhaps had written him.

Mr. Callahan requested that a research be conducted to

determine whether the FBI or the Department of Justice would be

authorized to pay for private counsel for employees called to testify

before the Senate Select Committee and who desired private counsel.

I advised Mr. Callahan that the position of the FBI and the

Department is that we could not provide counseldirectly to the individuals

because of the potential conflict of interest between the rights of the

individual and the duties of our officers. However, I told him that to my

knowledge the question concerning whether the Government could pay for

private counsel selected by the employee has not been researched.

Mr. Callahan therefore requested that the research be conducted.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Administrative Division and Legal Counsel confer

and prepare an appropriate response to Mr. Callahans request.

Legal Counsel memorandum to you dated 1-8-1

aptioned "senate Select Committee on Intelligenc

Activities," recommended that the Administrative Division

and Legal Counsel Division confer and prepare an appropriate

response to Mr. Callahan's request that research be con-

ducted to determine whether the FBI or the Department of

Justice would be authorized to pay for private counsel for

employees who are called to testify before the Senate

Select Committee and who desire private counsel.

We have

also undertaken to present the statutory considerations

governing the provision of such representation in a legal

proceeding as distinguished from a legislative hearing.

Title 5, United States Code, Section 3106, States:

"Except as otherwise authorized

by law, the head of an Executive

department or military department

tion in which the United States,

•an agency, or an employee theree AUG 1 1915

is a party, or is interested, or

for the securing of evidence there:

for, but shall refer the matter to

the

Department of Justice. . .

This statutory prohibition makes it clear that

only the Attorney General has the authority to make

contract for special employment of an attorney.

This

Bureau, as an agency of the Department of Justice, 0b-

viously does not have authority to do that which is

denied to Executive departments which are otherwise of

coequal stature to the Department of Justice.

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams

Authority of FBI and Department of Justice

to Retain Private Counsel to Represent Employees

An examination of our budgetary language by

representatives of the Administrative Division and this

Division does not disclose any explicit or implicit

authority which would qualify as

"otherwise authorized by

.". under the above statute.

the statutory

authority for provision of private counsel is contained in

attorneys. However, this authority is circumscribed by the

statement that these attorneys

"may, when specitically

directed by the Attorney General, conduct any kind of legal

proceeding, civil or criminal, including grand jury pro-

ceedings and proceedings before committing magistrates,

which United States Attorneys are authorized by law to

conduct. . . ."

It is evident then that this authority

pertains only to proceedings held within the judicial

system, not to hearings held before a legislative body.

Such a

• hearing is not a "legal proceeding" and is not

"which United States Attorneys are authorized by

law to conduct. . . ."

In the event that employees need representation

in a legal proceeding and the Department believes that a

potential conflict of interest would prevent it from

providing counsel, outside counsel could be appointed

paid under the statute up to the monetary limits fixed.

Whether the Department would allow the individual employee

to designate or select the outside counsel would be a

matter of Departmental policy but we see no reason why

such an individual selection would not ordinarily be

approved.

We are aware that the Central Intelligence

Agency (CIA) has recently engaged the law firm of Arnol

and Porter and that Mr. Mitchell Rogovin of that firm

has been designated as the individual attorney to represent

Inquiry with CIA has determined that the

authority relied on for this action is Title 50, United

This memorandum records Bureau walver from segrecy

agreement for interview of Atlanta Field Office (FO) SA Edward A.

Shea by Senate Select Committee (SSC) Staff Members at Atlanta,

7/22-23/75.

Supervisor S. F. Phillips of the Senstudy 75 Project

was in Atlanta 7/22/75 in connection with the interviews there

of six SAs (five from Atlanta FO; one who traveled to Atlanta

from Knoxville FO) by SSC Staff Members Michael Epstein and

Mary DeOreo.

Interviews concerned the former FBI investigation

7/22/75, Epstein telephonically contacted Phillips and

advised

that one of the interviews developed information resulting in

his desire to interview a seventh SA, Edward A. Shea of the

Atlanta FO. In order to avoid another trip to Atlanta,

Epstein asked if Phillips could obtain FBI clearance for the

interview which would concern: (1) any possible COINTELPRO

operations in Atlanta with respect to King or the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC); (2) Shea's assignment

to a "file review or file retrieval" project during past year

concerning COINTELPRO; and (3) concerning COINTELPRO "generally."

(It should be noted that earlier this year, Shea handled a

project relating to classifying documents in Atlanta files

regarding COINTELPRO. Shea advised Phillips of this and also

said that he does not recall seeing any documents regarding

COINTELPRO/SCLC - KING.) Epstein desired to interview Shea

the morning of 7/23/75.

On basis of foregoing request, Phillips

telephonically contacted Assistant Director (AD) Mintz

who granted clearance for (1) and (2) above and suggested

withholding clearance on (3) pending further request from

Epstein after interview on items (1) and (2). Mintz asked

that Phillips

touch base with AD Wannall for his concurrence.

In the absence of Wannall who was out of the building,

Deputy AD I. Leavitt concurred with Mintz. At about 5:30 p.m.,

7/22/75, Epstein was telephonically advised by Phillips as

indicated above--clearance for (1) and (2); not for (3) at

this time. Arrangements were then made for interview of

Shea morning of 7/23/75.

Subsequent interview of Shea (being reported

separately) apparently satisfied Epstein and it does not

appear there will be any further request as to item (3).

This memorandum records that no effort is being

made to respond to a request of the Senate Select Committee C

(SSC) dated 6/27/75, pursuant to instructions of the

Deputy Attorney General, until such time as the Department

can obtain clarification from the SSC regarding the meaning

of paragraph 2 in the SSC's letter of 6/27/75.

Memorandum Wannall to Adams, dated 6/30/75, reviewed

a draft copy of the SSC's letter to the Department.

This

draft copy is dated 6/25/75.

It is identical in content with

the final version dated 6/27/75.

Memorandum Cregar to Wannall, dated 7/2/75, reported

the results of a meeting in the office of the Deputy Attorney

General on the morning of 7/2/75. In this memorandum it was

pointed out that the Deputy Attorney General found considerable

difficulty in understanding paragraph 2 of the SSC's draft of

a letter dated 6/25/75. He noted that in view of the

ambiguities found in the letter, as well as the lack of any

specific agreement entered into with the SSC by the Department.

and/or the FBI, the Department should prepare a letter over

the Attorney General's signature asking for clarification.

In the meantime, the Deputy Attorney General advised that we

should take no action responsive to the requests levied on

the FBI in this letter.

To date, we have received no infor-

mation from the Department that a letter asking for clarification

of the SSC has been sent.

Within the Committee mandate, contained in

S. Res. 21, there are four broad subjects relating to the

intelligence community which we are required to investi-

gate and study in order to determine the facts and ulti-

mately to decide whether to make recommendations for

legislative or other changes.

They are:

1.. The structure, performance, and utility of

government operations with

respect to intel-'.

ligence activities.

2.

Whether certain policies or practices are

or are not illegal, unethical, or otherwise

improper.

3. Whether there has or has not been excessive

auplication or inadequate coordination be-

tween and among intelligence agencies and,

more generally, the efficiency of intelli-

gence activities.

4.

Whether there has or has not been adequate

internal and external control and oversight

over the policies and practices of intelli-

gence agencies.

In attempting to find the answers to these funda-

mental questions, the Committee is proceeding in two ways.

First, we are examining intelligence functions broadly as

instruments of government policy, giving attention to the

authority for particular functions, the problems which

intelligence activities are designed to solve, the proce-

dures by which intelligence activities are and have beer

proposed, approved, executed, evaluated, and terminated,

the range and scope of the activities utilized to achieve

intelligence objectives, and the propriety and utility of

Second, we will examine in

depth certain subjects within the broad topics of inves-

tigation. We would, of course, welcome your suggestion

cases that would give added insight into intelli-

gence matters under your jurisdiction.) These specific

subjects for investigation are not intended to limit the

scope contained in the more general questions.

The annexed notifications spell these matters

out in greater detail. In addition, they ask certain

specific questions, set forth certain previously requested

documents not yet received, request additional documents, *

and, in some cases, ask for the names and present addresses

of persons who have held certain positions.

Where appro-

priate, the subject's description indicates that, pursuant

to the

agreed Outline for Inquiry Procedures, the matter

primarily concerns allegations of abuse or other contro-

versial specific matters where there is reason to believe

Improprieties may have occurred.

Finally,

the notifications

indicate the name(s) of the staff member(s) who, in addition

to the Committee's senior staff, will be responsible for the

particular matters.

" The Committee, in the course of the next few

months, will undertake other subjects for investigation

as its

work proceeds and will notify you as appropriate.

We look forward to your cooperation in these

matters.

(INCLUDING DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE)

I.

Issues

The Committee's inquiry into the intelligence and

counterintelligence activities of the Federal Bureau

of Investigation is examining fundamental issues which

bear directly on the adequacy of current legislation

and adninistrative organization and procedure.

Comnittee seeks to determine whether FBI intelligence

counterintelligence activities achieve legitimate

objectives in conformity with the rule of law.

the basic issues to be addressed are the following:

"A.

What is the legal authority for FBI intelligence

and counterintelligence activities? Should the

FBI's authority be clarified or revised or

incorporated in a comprehensive statutory

charter?

B. What limitations are placed on FBI Intelligence

and counterintelligence activities by the

Constitution and laws of the United States?

limitations be clarified or

C. What have been the purposes and aims of FBI

intelligence and counterintelligence activities?

Should these objéctives be modified?:

D.

How have the intelligence and counterintelligence

activities of the FBI been organized and coordinated

with other agencies of government?

Should these

procedures and practices be revised?

E. What have been the procedures for and techniques

of intelligence gathering and dissemination and

counterintelligence operations used by the FBI?

Under what conditions and through what procedures

should these methods and techniques be used in

the future?

F.

What have been and should-be the mechanisms for

internal and external policy-making, contro.

and supervision of FBI intelligence and counter-

Intelligence activitles?

As a means of examining the above issues in the

context of actual FBi intelligence operations,

the committee intends to study certain specific

topics, some of which are general in nature, and

others

of which involve specific cases, programs

or techniques. Part II, below, contains descriptions

of the general areas into which the Committee: intends

to inquire.

Part III contains descriptions of the

specific cases mentioned above. The descriptions

specifically indicate whether the investigation may

concentrate on specific allegations of possible

abuses or other controversial matters where there

Is. reason to believe improprieties may have occurred.

In addition to the topics described below, additional

areas of inquiry may develop during the course of the

Committee's work.

II. Areas of General Inquiry

A. Legal Authority. for FBI Intelligence and Counter-

intelligence Activities

The Committee is examining the legal basis for FBI

intelligence and counterintelligence activities.

There may be serious question as to the adequacy

of the present legislative framework for the FBI's

functions in these fields. Current statutes

authorize the FBI to perform investigative and law

enforcement functions, but they do not specifically

authorize intelligence or counterintelligence

•activities. Therefore; the Committee seeks to

determine

whether the

FBI's authority should be

clarified, revised, or incorporated in a compre-

hensive statutory charter.

Responsible staff: Senior staff

Task Force

leader

Mark Gitenstein

B. Organization and Operation of the FBI Intelli-

gence Division

The Committee is investigating the structure and

operating practices of the FBI Intelligence Divi-

Proposals have been made that the national

security intelligence and counterintelligence

functions of the FBI should be lodged in a

a count on at i son Soarate

agency or otherwise separated from the FBI's

criminal investigative activities.

Further recom-

mendations have been advanced for improved coordina-

tion between the FBI and other intelligence agencies,

for strengthened

supervision of FBI intelligence and

counterintelligence activities by the Attorney

General or an independent board, and for clearer

standards and procedures for FBI activities in this

area.

Thererore, the committee desires complete

information on the operating practices and proce-

dures of the FBI Intelligence Division and of the

field

office activities supervised by the Intelli-

gence

Division.

"..

The Committee's inquiry focuses on the following

specific areas:

1. FBI Internal Security Intelligence Operations

The committee seeks to determine the nature

and purpose of FBI intelligence operations

directed at foreign intelligence activities

and subversive or extremist activities within

the United States. 'It has been alleged that

the scope of FBI intelligence investigations

is too broad and has extended to legitimate

political activities. Consequently, the Com-

mittee must examine how the FBI's responsibili-

ties have been defined.

Responsible staff: Senior staff

Task Force leader

Mark Gitenstein

2.

The FBI and the U. S. Intelligence Community

The Committee seeks to determine what have

been the policies and procedures for coordina-

tion between the FBI and other agencies in the

-U: S.

intelligence community.

There have been

occasions in the past where friction between

FBI and other agencies has produced

serious

dissatisfaction. within the U. S. intelligence

The purpose of this inquiry is to

evaluate the adequacy of past and present co-

ordinating mechanisms.

FBI Foreign Counterintelligence Operations

The Committée seeks to determine the nature of

FBI counterintelligence operations directed at

foreign intelligence activities within the

United States or at any other hostile foreign-

related activities within the United States.

Since FBI operations to "counter" these activi-

ties go beyond intelligence collection, the

Committee must consider whether such practices

require statutory authorization.

The impact

of counterintelligence operations on United

States foreign relations will also be considered..

Inspection Division Investigations

The Committee is examining the relationship

of the FBI Inspection Division to FBI intelli-

gence and counterintelligence activities. This

includes both regular Inspection Division

reviews of Intelligence Division and field

office functions

and specific investigations

of allegations of improper conduct in connec-

tion. with FBI intelligence activities.

FBI Intelligence Activities and State or Local

Law Enforcement Agencies

The Committee seeks to determine the nature of

the relationships between FBI intelligence

activities and

state and local law enforcement

agencies.

subject involves the delicate

balance between the necessary centralization

of certain law

enforcement activities and the

Constitutionally-mandated decentralization of

general law enforcement responsibility. It is

necessary for the Committee to evaluate the

centralizing influence of the FBl, as well as

the FBI's role as a check on local law enforce-

ment abuses.

interception of communications including wiretap-

ping, electronic eavesdropping, consensual elec-

tronic surveillance interception of video and data

communications, local monitoring devices, and all

other forms of electronic or technical monitoring.

The Committee's general questions apply to each of

* the

techniques listed above,

as well as to the

matters

set forth in the following specific cases.

1.

Warrantless Electronic Surveillance

The Committee seeks to determine whether the

Attorney General should have the authority

to authorize electronic

tain purposes without a surveillance for cer-

prior judicial warrant.

This power has been exercised by succeeding

Attorneys General since 1940, upon the explicit

directive of the President.

The Supreme Court

has ruled that this power does not extend to

but the remaining scope

of the Attorney teneral's authority remains un-

definedby the supreme court.

...

Questions

The Committee requests that the FBI and the

Justice Department address the following specific

• questions:

a. What is the scope and basis of the claim

of Executive authority to conduct warrant-

less electronic surveillance?

b.

What have been the procedures for considera-

tion and approval of requests for warrantless

electronic surveillance authorized by the

Attorney General?

c.

What are the specific disadvantages of the

judicial warrant requirement for those

electronic surveillances which have been

authorized by the Attorney General?

d.

Does the Fourth Amendment permit the

issuance of judicial warrants for elec-

tronic surveillance on grounds other than

ordinary probable cause where national

security intelligence purposes are advanced

to justify the surveillance?

e.

documents bearing on the questions stated above:

a. All written justifications for the specific

authorizations by the Attorney General for

warrantless electronic surveillance from

Clandestine Informant Activities

The Comnittee Is examining all aspects of the

FBI's use of informants, sources, and undercover

personnel and the techniques employed by such per-

sons.

Although informants are the single most

productive source of intelligence information, the

difficulties of controlling their activities may

increase the possibility of improper conduct. The

use of informants to infiltrate organizations also

may pose dangers to the right of associational pri-

Consequently, proposals have been made for

the imposition of a jualcial warrant requirement

or other safeguards for the use of informants.

The Committee seeks to evaluate such proposals as

well as the contributions of informants to the

accomplishment of legitimate objectives.

In addition, the Committee is examining informant

activities with respect to several particular situa-

tions and cases.

This investigation may involve

specific allegations of abuse or controversial

matters where there is reason to believe improprie-

ties may have occurred. The Committee's inquiry

covers the general circumstances surrounding the

following incidents or cases:

a. Wounded Knee;

b. Kent State;

c. • New York v. Stroble (Attica);

d. United States v. Buckalew (Gainesville);

e. United States v. Briggs (Camden) ;

f. New York v. Dillon (Hobart College);

g. United States v. Marshall (Seattle).

Additional cases may also be examined.

In addition to the above cases, the Committee is

examining the role of FBI informants in providing

information to the FBI concerning members of the

following organizations:

Additional studies of informant activities with

respect to members of other organizations may be

formulated.

Questions

the committee requests

that the FBI and the Justice

• Department address the following specific questions:

above, what allegations, whether unfounded of

not, of improper, illegal, unethical, or provoca-

tive conduct by FBI informants have been made in

connection with these situations or groups?

2.

What measures has the FBI taken to investigate

such allegations of misconduct and to prevent

such alleged misconduct from taking place in the

future?

3. What instructions has the FBI given to its in-

formants with respect to possible improper,

In accord with our telephone conversation of August 12th,

I am forwarding to you a letter from the Senate Select

Committee requesting answers to questions relating to

electronic surveillance conducted by the Federal govern-

ment in the interests of national security. The Committee

has been told that we would try to respond to their

request by August 20th.

That date is fast approaching

and may not be a reasonable period of time in which to

compile the information requested and respond to their

questions. That date is useful target, however. since

any issues to be presented to the Attorney General with

ispact to complying to this request must be considered

prior to August 19th, the date the Attorney General is

scheduled to leave Washington.

Would your office please prepare responses to the following

questions that involve areas with which, I believe, you

are familiar: questions 2-10, 11(b)-(d), 12, 14, 15, 17,

21 and 24.

Your letters, and the

recent testinony of Kevin

I. Maroney and Clarence i. iclley before the House Suo-

conmittee on Courts, Civil Liberties,

the Committee wishes to pursue.

Further questions are •

raised by the July 1,. 1975, khite House news briefing by

the Press Secretary relating to the effect of the recent

¡Zucibon accision.

Some of these questions

relate to general

policy considerations

in the electronic surveillance area;

others address our need for a more complobe factual base

from which we can draw our concisions.

a list of inese

questions is attached to this lotter:

these questions, of

course, do not supersede price requests for material

relating to electronic surver lance, which are Itemized in

the document rechests of May T4, June Is, and June 2T.

Räther, they should be considered as supplementary to

the prior requests.

I believe that the answers to these questions

are e sential to a complete understanding of the policies

and 1:ocedures followcủ by the Justico Department in elec-

tIon c surveillance cases. Full information on these mat

ters is necessary for the Committee to fulfill its mandate

"to ecommend the enactment of any new legislation

nect isary or desirable to strengthen or clarify the national

security, intelligence, or surveillance activities of the

United States and to protect the rights of United States

With the con-

that the Committee. will be able to discharge

this respon-

Through arrangements made by Mr. John Hotis, Legal,

Counsel Division, Unit Chief Homer A. Newman, IS-1 Section, bl

Intelligence Division, was interviewed for the purpose of

developing general information regarding the handling of

intormant files within the FBl by Mr. John I. Elliff and

Mr. Mark Gitenstein of the Domestic Intelligence Task Force!!

U. S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities.

The interview was conducted on 8/4/75 in FBI space and

lasted from approximately 2:00 p.m. until 2:30 p.m.

The interview was extremely general in nature and

dealt exclusively with general information regarding the

handling of informant files both in the field and at FBIHQ.

The questions asked dealt with such matters as what type of

files were maintained in the field and at FBIHQ regarding

informants and generally the types of information contained

therein. They were particularly interested as to whether or

not an individual informant file either at FBIHQ or in the

field would contain information which would specifically

identify informants other than the informant on which the

file was maintained. They also inquired whether or not there￾

was a sub A section of each informant file maintained at FBIHQ

Tạch

as was the case in the field. Questions were also asked as to

whether or not the individual file maintained at FBIHQ on

informants would run into several volumes.

This inquiry was

answered to the effect that the size of the file would depend

on the activity of the informant, how long,

he had been,

operated, etc.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re:

Senstudy

It was readily apparent that they were asking these

questions with the thought in mind of requesting access to

certain informant files, the identity of which they already

had but did not divulge.

They did state specifically that

the informant files in which they would have an interest

amounted to approximately ten and were all on informants

that had publicly been exposed for one reason or another

and were no longer being operated as current informants.

The indication was that the request would be for access

only to such files for review in FBI space.

PROPOSED PROCEDURES FOR ACCESS

TO FBI MATERIALS BY THE SENATE

SELECT COMMITTEE

On the afternoon of July 24, 1975, K. William O'Connor, Special

Counsel in the Department, met with Deputy Associate Director Adams

and me to present us with a copy of the proposed procedures and to discuss

any amendments the Bureau might request. I asked Mr. O'Connor who had

approved this latest draft of the proposed procedures and he said that they

had been tentatively approved by the Attorney General and the White House.

I specifically asked him who in the White House had approved them and

he said that they had been approved by Mi. Buchen (Counsel to the

President).

8

Mr. Adams and I discussed the procedures with Mic. O'Connor

and suggested to him as indicated by my inked notation on the bottom of

page 2A that the word 'use" used in subparagraph (d) should be further

defined by a footnote that would specify the limitations on information to be

provided the Committee and its staff concerning the identities of persons

to whom the FBI has undertaken an obligation of confidentiality. Mr. O'Connor

agreed to the proposed change and in our presence telephonically communicated

with John Elliff and obtained his concurrence in the amendment to sub-

paragraph (d).

REC- 102

1d111605

Mr. Adams told Mr. O'Connor that the FBI was not agreeing

to the procedures in substance but that we recognized the authority of the

Attorney General in these matters and would abide by his decision that the

proposed procedures would be implemented on agreement by the Committee.

Mr. O'Connor said he understood that and he advised John Elliff that the

Bureau had acquiesced in the proposed procedures with the one amendment

described above. Mr. O'Connor departed indicating that he was going to

proceed to meet with the Committee and obtain final agreement as to the text

of the proposed procedures. The drait of the procedures is attached for the

Directorisanfor mation.

INFORMATIVE NOTE

Date -

8/4/75

In connection with our responses to

the Senate Select Committee (SSC), the

White House has instructed that the Intel-

ligence Community prepare a briefing for

Senators Church and Tower of the SSC

regarding warrantless electronic surveil

lances and surreptitious entries. During

meetings of the Intelligence Community, it

was agreed that NSA, FBI and CIA would

give

the briefings. No date has been scheduled

for the briefings, although it is antici-

pated representatives of the White House

will monitor a preview of the actual brief+

ing to be given Senators Church and Tower.

During meetings of the Intelligence

Community representatives, to discuss the

contents of such a briefing, it was agreed

among representatives of NSA, CIA and FBI

chat erforts would be made to avoid 1dent1-

rying specific foreign targets of surrepti-

tious entries or warrantless electronic

surveillances.

Attached is a memorandum from CIA

advising that CIA has already disseminated

to the SSC information concerning sensitive

technical operations against certain

Embassies and diplomatic establishments in

the U.s.(5)

On 8/6/75, Daniel M. (Mac) Armstrong, I, who was

on the personal staff of former Acting Director Gray, called to advise

DARA

that he had been contacted by John Elliff. He had known Elliff casually

during the confirmation hearings regarding Mr. Gray. Elliff told him

that he was personally interested in determining background on two matters

which were: (1) the decision to abolish the Crime Records Division; and

(2) the Legal Attache program.

Armstrong told him that he had no knowledge concerning the

Crime Records Division and had not even learned of its abolishment until

after the fact. Armstrong referred Elliff to Dave Kinley regarding that

topic. Armstrong said that Elliff did not want to talk to him concerning the

Legal Attache program over the phone and said he would contact him in the

near future for an appointment to see him personally.

Armstrong said he was passing this information along to us in

order to keep us advised of his contacts with the Senate Select Committee

concerning his Bureau information which came to him as a result of his

Bureau employment.

In our discussions preparatory to the briefing to

be given

to Senators Church

and Tower, we have agreed to try

to avoid identitying specific toreign targets of the various

types of operations which

will be discussed, although it was

generally recognized that it would be impossible to avoid

discussing the Soviet target specifically. I have recently

learned that the SSC Staff is aware of the fact (from material

turned over to them by CIA) that CIA "participated in a series

of electronic surveillance operations in the U.S."

The infor-

mation is contained in a single paragraph, which goes on io,

say:

JEK'

•Act

JFK Act

2. This being so, it can be expected that the Staff will

have brought this information to the senators' attention, and

I will be prepared to respond factually to questions with re

spect to these operations, which of course were carried out in

pursuit of NSA requirements, and

support.

on July 31, 1975, Mr. Dan Dwyer, Research Assistant,

senate select Committee, advised SA Seymor F. Phillips that he

nad some specific questions to ask concerning his review of the

Classifying Guide, Files and Communications Division.

Supervisor Paul F- Shea and Classifying Unit Supervisor Odell

Wheeler answered the following questions raised by Mr. Dwyer:

(1) Explain the difference in applicant mail categories, i.e.

main files, general files and setup files? These definitions were

given to him in accordance with the manual; in addition, our pro-

"00" files

and subfiles

Telephone Rm. -

Director Sec'y

FENZIN IS UN2: 45613X8

to him that the 62 classification is interchangeable with other

designated classifications, for example, that incoming 62 material

could be placed in an existing file on the subject rather than

opening a separate 62 file. (4) Describe what you mean by the

standard sublist.

It was explained that a subnumber is assigned

to each one of our field offices and to each foreign country; that

ready reference to a particular area or locality. (5) What is

the meaning of the character of a case?

It was explained that we

have utilized 185 classification numbers to date and that each of

these classifications has a corresponding character.

The example

given was the 26 classification and corresponding ITSMV character.

(6) What is meant by the 134 classification being interchangeable

with the

subversive list?

It was explained to him that from the

185 classifications approximately 60 of these are termed subversive

from an administrative standpoint.

The 134J classification which

designates a security informant is interchangeable with certair

subversive classifications on the subversive list.

I feel it incorporates the matters agreed upon at the

meeting.

Please note the memo to Mr. Levi from

O'Connor indicates these procedures are designed

"to permit broad access for SSC staff to FBI

materials," and the proposed procedures do not rule

out the possibility that the Committee can request

complete files for review. Accordingly, if you have

no objection, we will advise the Attorney General

that you have reviewed the proposed procedures and

will abide by his judgment, however, we continue to

object to granting of access to raw files of the FBI

to representatives of the SSC. Attached is a letter

to the AG so stating.

This draft of "Proposed Procedures" has not been discussed

with SSC staff.

It is intended to reflect the substance of the

discussion had on 7/21, in your office; and incorporates (as

underscored) additional language for the purposes suggested by

that discussion. Also reflected are the slight editorial changes

requested by the SSC in the draft attached to Senator Church's

letter of July 18, 1975.

These piucedures are designeù to pornat divaù access idi

SSC staff to FBI materials at the FBI, or delivery of such materialss

if appropriate, to the SSC. The present scope of the access is

defined by the requests as received; those extant are the subject

of superseding redraft under paragraph 1. The prospective scope of

requested information is not restricted, but is subject to negotiation

as indicated in the amendment to paragraph I.

The proposed modification of paragraph 3 will be the focus of

most connoversy. Tne sol will probably object to che withholding

of sournes under paragraph 3íd, (proposed) saying that accass to

inforation at the FBI offices is all that is required; that no

note on such documents can be removed from the premises of the FBI

under procedure 6; and that if they wish to pursue any sources,

the appeal provision of existing paregraph 6 should cover it.

Since that was the purpose of paragraph 6, and since paragraph 6(a)

was designed to focus on any real problem which might arise, the

scope of the stated problem under paragraph 3(d) may be seen by the

SSC as an artempt to withhold information from the SSC staff, and

delay the inquiry (since the Bureau would have to do considerable pre

delivery work under 3(d) to make properly defined and reviewed

deletions). Accordingly, I would expect SSC to assert (a) DOJ

does not trust SSC probity or security, and (b) DJ is following

a dilatory and unnecessary tactic.

In anticipation of these problems, I have re-writter

paragraph 9 to permit unilateral abrogation if the procedures

do not work. If actual information withheld is capriciously

defined, or if any lapse of good judgment occurs, I would expect

prompt abrogation by SSC and a very severe criticism of the

Director, the Attorney General, and the Department.

I think that is a high risk, and assumption of it places

a very heavy burden upon the Bureau, initially, and upon the

Department, ultimately.

My recommendation is that the proposed procedures be

attempted as redrafted, subject to Attorney General and White

Jouse approval; but a vigorous caveat is indicated as to the

need for real restraint in the

exercise of initial FBI discretion

under paragraph 3(d) .

of specific materials, relevant to the inquiry being conducted under

S.R. 2L, to which the Conmittee staff wishes access or of which the

Cormittee desires delivery. Any questions as to the scope or meaning

of any portion of such list shall be identified by the Special Counsel

and discussed at the time of acceptance of the list, between the DIFL

and the Special. Counsel.

The first such list will be delivered to the Department of

Justice within 48 hours of the adoption of this procedure, and will

surmarize and supersede all the presently outstanding requests; this

list will be in priority order, as fixed by the Committee, with fixed

delivery /access dates specified. Those materials for which the com

mittee requests delivery or access shall be delivered to the Cormittee

or made accessible in Room 4171 of the Hoover Building not later than

within 18 96 hours of the date specified. The Cormittee Chairman and

Vice Chairman shall be informed by the Attorney General, within 24 hours

of receipt of the request, of any delay beyond 48 96 hours, the expected

length of the delay, and the specific reasons for the delay. Partial

access or delivery shall be proffered, by the Bureau of/to any materials

requested, while the balance of such materials are being prepared. A

partial proffer shall not extend the time of full response set forth

herein.

The Attorney General may exempt specific topical areas of

inquiry from the scope of these procedures. Such topical areas

shall be identified by the Attorney General to the Chairman and

Vice Chairman by letter upon consideration of the lists submitted

pursuant to this provision. As to any such exemption, the proce-

dure to be followed shall be proposed, defined, adopted, and

followed after consideration by the SSC of the specific exemption,

and pertinent inquiry and discussion at the staff level.

(2) The following procedures shall apply (a) where delivery of

materials requested might jeopardize FBI sensitive sources or

ongoing operations, on (b) where the Domestic Task Force Leader

requests access to materials, father than delivery to the SSC.

(3) The Departmant will furnish access at the Hoover Building in

Room 4171 to those materials requested:

(a) only to the members of the Committee, where it is deter-

mined by the Attorney General that the materials involve peculiarly

sensitive foreign intelligence sources or sensitive ongoing operations.

(b) In all other cases, to the appropriately cleared staff who

will have access to all of the materials.

(c) An exception to (a) and (b) above is made for the identities

unless the identity of the individual as an informant or potential.

informant has already been made known to the Committee, or unless the

Attorney General, the Chairman and Vice Chairman, jointly agree on the

limited disclosure of such identities to the Chairman and Vice Chairman.

(d) An exception to (a) and (b) above is made for information which

would identify persons, as sources, who have provided or continue to

provide information to the FBI, and as to whose identity the FBI has

undertaken an obligation of confidentiality. In order to preserve

that obligation of confidentiality, the FBI will withhold access to

this class of information, unless the identity of the individual as

a source has already been made known to the Connittee, or unless the

Attorney General, the Chairman and Vice Chairman, jointly agree on

the limited disclosure of such identities to the Chairman and Vice

Chairman.

(4) Those materials to which the staff has access may be reviewed and

studied in Room 4171 of the Hooves Building and such notes may be

taken as deemed appropriate by the Staff.

(5) The Conmittee staff shall select from these materials to which

access is herein provided, those materials which it deems pertinent

to the Committee's inquiries and necessary for delivery to the

Comnittee's offices.

(6) The Bureau shall make copies of such materials as are specified

by the staff under the provisions of (5) above for transfer to the

Committee's offices

• (a) before the copies of such materials are taken to the

Committee's offices, the Bureau shall, within 24 hours of the

selection, make appropriate excisions and paraphrases of infon

mation which might, if inadvertently disclosed, endanger sensitive

or sensitive

FBI sources

ase/ongoing operations.

(b) If the Task Force Leader has any objections to the excisions

or paraphrases, the materials in issue will be forthwith conveyed by

the Bureau, with a written statement of its grounds for its position,

to the Special Counsel who shall resolve the matter by negotiation

within 24 hours.

(c) In the event the matter is not resolved within 24 hours, the

Special Counsel shall submit the matter forthwith to the Attorney

General who shall notify the Chairman forthwith and arrange for an

appropriate disposition.

(7) The Committee staff may remove to the office of SSC for appropriate

use, any notes which they may make upon review of material screened by

the FBI, as provided in (6) above, without such notes being reviewed

by the Bureau. The Cormittee staff may remove notes on unscreened

materials only if such notes are reviewed and cleared by the Bureau

under the provisions of (6) (a) thru (c) above.

(8) The staff and the members of the Cormittee may examine the

original materials to which the staff has been given access as

extensively as necessary, in the Hoover Building at Room 4171,

during normal FBI business hours; upon reasonable notice, special

arrangements may be made for access at other times.

(9) These procedures are adopted subject to satisfactory experience

in implementation. If after a fair trial the procedures herein do

not operate suitably in the view of either the SSC or the Attorney

General, the procedures may be unilaterally set aside by either the

SSC or the Attorney General and other appropriate and suitable

methods of procedure undertaken.

Mr. Adams with Mr. O'Connor

Washington, D. C. 20530

in the DAG's office. 7/21/15

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

AAm O.LA.

Thank you for your letter replying to our letter concerning

access by certain members of the Select Committee to files and

documents concerning them held by the Department, including the

FBI.

The Committee has resolved to adopt a slightly different

procedure than that proposed in your letter.

As you know, the

purpose of this particular request is to enable the members,

through analysis of materials relating to them, to obtain general

insights into how the Department of Justice, including the

Federal Bureau of Investigation, collects, maintains and retrieves

for itself material on Americans generally. Accordingly, we

suggest that at a mutually convenient time, the designated members

come to the Department or the Bureau and physically go through

the retrieval process with the persons who would be responsible

for performing that function in a real life situation.

Committee members do not wish to have their individual files

either removed from the filing system or "sanitized" prior to

their reviewing them.

LX-101

This proposed method of on site review may help, moreover,

to alleviate the possible problems of disclosure to the particular

members which your letter adverted to.

We are sure that you

could discuss any remaining actual problems with the members

themselves at your premises, including whatever retrieval problems

may exist with respect to the letters from the members themselves

which you referred to.

In the first instance, what the members seek is insight

SEBJECT: YLEGAL AUTHORITY OF THE FBI

TO USE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS

AS AN INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUE

#mDE 16

ATE TORNA CINT COTTONI

The legal authority of the FBI to use confidential

informants as an investigative technique rests upon three factors:

1) Legislative authority embodied in the approval

of the annual appropriation.

2) Case law that the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth

Amendments do not protect a wrongdoer from

the use of informants.

3) Case law reflecting that courts recognize the

necessity and utility of informants in providing

provavie cause fui inaning arrests without a

warrant, and for obtaining warrants, provided

that certain conditions are met.

Regarding the first of the above-cited factors,

reference is made to the "Hearings Before a Subcommittee of the

Committee on Appropriations, House of Representatives, Departments

of State, Justice and Commerce, the Judiciary and Related Agencies

Appropriations for 1974."

Part I, page 783 of those hearings, sets forth the

justification language for the 1974 budget estimate for FBI salaries

and expenses. It is noted that this language is the same as used'in'

previous years except for underlined and bracketed changes which

do not affect this subject. There is specific provision under the

PGD :11

nation outside your Committee.

Re: LEGAL AUTHORITY OF THE FBI TO USE CONFIDENTIAL

INFORMANTS AS AN INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUE

heading of "Salaries and Expenses" for "expénses necessary for the.

detection and prosecution of crimes against the United States" and

more specifically for the "payment of rewards."

At page 879 of these hearings, there is sei forth

as part of the testimony on "Investigative Accomplishments," a

paragraph detailing the statistics achieved by the use of confidential

informants. Since Congress has approved FBI appropriations without

objection to the use of money for "payment of rewards" or for the

informant achievements listed in the testimony, the approval of the

appropriations serves as one form of legislative approval for the

use of informants.

• The use of informants does not violate the defendant's

rights under the Fourth Amendment. Hoffa v. United States, 385

U.S. 293 (1966).

"Neither this Court, nor any member of it has

ever expressed the view that the Fowth Amend-

ment protects a wrongdoer's misplaced belief

that a person to whom he voluntarily confides

his wrongdoing will not reveal it. Indeed, the

Court unanimously rejected that very contention

---in Lopez v. United States, 373 U.S. 427---"

Id. at 302

The Court also held that the use of an informer did

not violate Hoffa's rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments,

citing United States V. Dennis, 183 F. 2d 201, 224, (1950), which

said,

"Courts have countenanced the use of informers

from time immemorial; in cases of conspiracy,

or in other cases when the crime consists of

preparing for another crime it is usually necessary

to rely upon them or upon accomplices because

the criminals will almost certainly proceed

covertly."

Memorandum. Donahue to Mr. Mintz

Rẹ: LEGAL AUTHORITY OF THE FBI TO USE CONFIDENTIAL

INFORMANTS AS AN INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUE

Besides the explicit recognition reflected above of

the right of investigative bodies to avail themselves of informants,

there are other Supreme Court cases which implicitly recognize

this right by regulating the conditions under which an informant's

identity need be revealed at trial. (Roviaro v. United States,

353 U.S. 53 (1957)), or the conditions to be met in using an

informant's information as the basis of probable cause for an

arrest without a warrant. (Drapery. United States, 358 U.S. 307

(1959); McCray v. Ilinois. 38ộ U.S. 300 (1967)). Similarly,

the Supreme Court has recognized that informant information may

form the basis for a warrant application, provided the affidavit

shows the underlying circumstances which would give reason to

believe the informant is credible, and circumstances showing

the basis for conclusions reached by the informant. (Aguilary.

Texas.

378 U.S. 108 (1964)).

The above-cited cases show that while couris have

circumscribed in several ways the uses to be made of informant

information, there has always been a recognition of the fact that

the informant is a basic and necessary weapon in law enforcement's

defense of society against crime.

RECOMMENDATION:

None; for information.

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE:

(A) INFORMANT MATTERS - DEFENSE PLANS AND STRATEGY -

Recently there have been several instances where attorneys in connection

with law suits have publicly and erroneously alleged that the FBI utilized

intormants to uncover detense plans and strategy. Also, recently a former

informant falsely alleged that informant's services were utilized by the

Bureau to infiltrate a defense camp.

These accusations reemphasize the

need for the careful and professional handling of informants at all times.

As you are aware under current policy, informants are advised

to avoid becoming involved in defense plans or strategy in subversive-type

cases or with anyone under criminal indictment. It is the responsibility

of all Special Agents handling intormants to insure that their informants

are continually alert so that they will avoid becoming invoived in defense

matters and in the event an informant is requested to assist or partake in

such matters, that the contacting Agent is immediately advised so that the

matter will be recorded. It ine informant cannot avoid being involved,

informant is not to report any information pertaining to defense plans or

strategy and such incident must be promptly reported to the Bureau under

the substantive case caption.

In view of the above, the statement of cooperation normally

signed by security and extremist informants is being amended to incorporate

current policy regarding defense plans and strategy. Where it is not required

as in criminal informant cases or it has not been practical to obtain a state-.

ment of cooperation, each handling Agent must orally advise the informant

of the above, reduce it to writing, and record it in the informant's file. Insure

that all pending informant files reflect the above as a matter of recora.

Manual changes follow.

in 1965 is rather ambiguous and nonspecific and efforts to

and probably the communists wouid end up in charge; we can go in there and

try to get them to agree and go on the constitution and let thera vete on it in

69 or SD days, angervice the election and have a cabinet wa mutually agreed

upon which I can check upon; then cace we got it, holy the President with

some inteliigence people to point up uno are communists.

te said they ought

to be Lacina or ones who speak the language and he wented me to take charga

of that and to start right now saying it i were Fresident, what I wouid do down

there to get rid of the communists.. The President stated it can't be done in

one day, but that is what he wants for the Dominican lepurlic.

I told the President I had quite a number of Agents, a hundred or so,

who are expert in the Spanish ianguage so we have the lacilitics that we can do

that.

The Fresident assed that I looks at the best ones and see who it is; that

it has to be a fellow who can get along with the new President whore he can

trust, to figure out what I need, how I would set it us, and what I woulu do

to get set up to go to work on the communists.

I stated I thought it can be

SUBJECT:

LEGAL ATTACHE'S OFFICE,

DOMINICAN REPUBLIO..

The Director advised that the President will want the FBI to

set up a group in the Dominican Republic to advise the President of

the Dominican Republic concerning Communists, how to deal with them,

and how to get rid of them.

It is contemplated that we will set up

a Legal Attache's Office,

with a group of 20 to 25 men, for the purpose

ot taking charge of cleaning out communists in the Dominican 'Govern-

ment and advising the government of those who may try to infiltrate.

into the government.

This activity would take place first in the

city of Santo Domingo, and then extend throughout the country until

all communists have been spotted and the Dominican Government has been

advised.

All of the agents to be sent down should be fluent in Spanish

and we should select any who have Dominican or Spanish blood,; which

will assist them in working inconspicuously with the populace.

Relative to the 'Legal Attache, he should be a top man, fully

experienced, as he

will be dealing with the President of the Dominican

Republic and with our Ambassador there.

ACTION:

In anticipation of the above, the Director desires that we

draw up suggestions for a Legal Attache and for a group of twenty to

twenty-five men who can proceed, when so ordered,

to the Dominican

Republic for this purpose.

A copy of this memorandum is being designated for the

Administrative Division so that the Domestic Intelligence Division

and the Administrative Division can work together on this.

Time

Is of the essence.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

In Reply, Please Rejer io

June 2, 1965

• WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

File No.

(A) • DOMINICAN SITUATION (NATIONALITY GROUP COVERAGE - LATIN

AMERICA-- For your information, Bureau has established a Legal Attache.

in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, who has already begun to make a

valuable contribution to the over-all efforts of the United States in making

certain that the Dominican Republic does not become another Cuba. If the

United States succeeds in its efforts to keep communists out of the new

Dominican coalition government which is in the process of being formed,

current United States policy in the Dominican Republic could very well

become the established course of action for all other countries in Latin

• America threatened with communism.

The responsibilities which have been placed upon the Bureau

in developing intelligence data in the Dominican Republic, as well as in

other Latin-American countries, are not only tremendous but may be the

heaviest and most far-reaching burden the FBI has ever been asked to

assume in the intelligence field. To guarantee our complete success,

teamwork is a must.

Accordingly, first we must do everything possible to assist

Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, in his immediate task of developing

quality sources of sufficient quantity to effect maximum coverage in the

Dominican Republic.

In this regard, each office and Legal Attache must furnish

to the Bureau within five days of the receipt of this letter under the caption

of "DOMSIT" (code word for "Dominican Situation") the following:

(1) Identities of any established sources (former or current)

who are now in the Dominican Republic.

(2) Persons in Dominican Republic known to personnel of

your office who appear to have good source potential.

(3) Identities of any current security sources (regardless of

nationality) who may be available for assignment (temporary or permanent)

in the Dominican Republic if such is considered feasible by Legal Attache,

Santo Domingo.

This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for dissemi-

nation outside your Committee.

Its use is limited to offrcial proceedings o1

your Committee and the content may not be disclosed to unauthorized verson

nel without the express approval of the FBI.

Any leads for purpose of checking background of potential sources

for Santo Domingo must receive priority attention and results submitted by

teletype.

In addition to the Dominican requirements placed upon the Bureau,

your attention is directed to over-all need for additional informants and

sources in the Latin-American field. The reputation the Bureau has gained

during recent Dominican crisis is due in large part to the results achieved

in developing Dominican sources through a concentrated informant develop-

ment program over the past several years.

In view of critical state of unrest in Latin America today, each

office should survey its informant coverage in this field. If substantial

numbers of nationals of any Latin-American country reside within the

territory covered by your office, Bureau expects that you will have coverage

sufficient to alert you to exile organizational activities of political nature,

plots to overthrow existing governments, and general intelligence data

concerning the countries of interest. Informant development in this field

Is considered most important and any weaknesses which now exist must be

overcome promptly by instituting an aggressive informant development

program.

TO

HI. W. C. Sullivan

DATE: August 22, 1966

FROM : HI. W. R. Wannall

SUBJECT: OPERATIONS

LEGAL ATTACHE,

USANTO DOMINGO OFFICE

This is to recommend that the Central Intelligènce

Agency (CIA) be advised that we have set up a regular Legal

Attache Office in Santo Domingo in view of the Fresident's

desire that the FBI remain in the Dominican Republic and

that

Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, be authorized to turn

informants over to the Agency.

In accordance with the desire of the President and

recommendation of the Honorable Marvin Watson, Special

Assistant to the President, that the FBI remain in the Domirican

Republic, the Director, on 8/2/66, advised the Yhite House

that our staff in Santo Domingo would be reduced to three ren

and that henceforth this office will be manned in a nanner

¿similar to that of our other Legal Attache Offices. It will not

¿ be an operational öffice but rather will serve as a strategic

listening post for intelligence data and as liaison with

agencies of the Dominican Republic, as well as other agencies

If foreign goverments in that country.

==.

In light of this redirection of effort, we instructed

Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, to review his informant covéraze-

to determine if any of our informants should be made availaile

to the Agency for operation. Legal Attache has recommended

that Me informants, Cau

so, be turned over to CIA.

Babesia has been used principally to develop subversive data

on individuals in Santiago, Dominican Republic.

heres is

a penetrative-type informant who has gained membership in

•Dominican subversive groups. Both of these sources are

operational and are not the type we would contact in a normal

laison capacity. Continuation of their services under our

current criteria would be a questionable procedure.

This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for dissemi-

nation outside your Committee..

Its use is limited to official proceedings by

your Committee and the content may not be disclosed to unauthorized person

nel without the express approval of the FBI .

RE:

LEGAL ATTACHE, SANTO DOMINGO OFFICE

8.

In the case of

this informant was originally

developed by the New York Office.

Legal Attache suggested

the New York Office might have use of informant's services.

This information furnished to New York Office which replied

that in the absense of organized activity informant would be

of no use unless he came to New York with instructions from

Dominican communist groups to reorganize activity.. This,

of course, is not a desirable situation.

OBSERVATIONS:

We believe Legal Attache, Santo Domingo's recommendation

to turn

over to CIA is sound, even though

both of these sources are in a position to furnish valuable

Intelligence information to us.

By making these informants

available to the Agency we will avoid any possible duplication

or conflict. This matter should be discussed with appropriate

officials by our Liaison Agent in order to insure the igency

is fully aware of our current status in the Dominican Republic.

ACTION:

If you approve:

officials as follows:

All of the agents to be sent down snouid ve fluent in Spanish

WASHINGION, D.C. 20535

File No.

(A) DOMINICAN SITUATION (NATIONALITY GROUP COVERAGE - LATIN

AMERICA) -- For your information, Bureau has established a Legal Attache

it Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, who has already begun to make a

valuable contribution to the over-all efforts of the United States in making

certain that the Dominican Republic does not become another Cuba. If the

United States succeeds in its efforts to keep communists out of the new

Dominican coalition government which is in the process of being formed,

current United States policy in the Dominican Republic could very well

become the established course of action for all other countries in Latin

America threatened with communism.

The responsibilities which have been placed upon the Bureau

in developing intelligence data in the Dominican Republic, as well as in

other Latin-American countries, are not only tremendous but may be the

heaviest and most far-reaching burden the FBI has ever been asked to

assumo in the intolligence field. To guarantee pur complete succesa:

teamwork is a must.

Accordingly, first we must do everything possible to assist

Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, in his immediate task of developing

quality sources of sufficient quantity to effect maximum coverage in the

Dominican Republic.

In this regard, each office and Legal Attache must furnish

"to the Bureau within five days of the receipt of this letter under the caption

• of "DOMSIT" (code word for "Dominican Situation") the following:

(1) Identities of any established sources (former or current)

who are now in the Dominican Republic.

...

(2) Persons in Dominican Republic known to personnel of

your office who appear to have good source potential.

.÷..

(3) Identities of any current security sources (regardless of

nationality) who may be available for assignment (temporary or permanent)

in the Dominican Republic if such is considered feasible by Legal Attache,

Santo Domingo.:

Any leads for purpose of checking background of potential sources

for Santo Domingo must receive priority attention and results submitted by

teletype.

In addition to the Dominican requirements placed upon the Bureau,

your attention is directed to over-all need for additional informants and

sources in the Latin-American field. The reputation the Bureau has gained

during recent Dominican crisis is due in large part to the results achieved

in developing Dominican sources through a concentrated informant develop-

ment program over the past several years.

In view of critical state of unrest in Latin America today, each

office should survey its informant coverage in this field. If substantial

numbers of nationals of any Latin-American country reside within the

territory covered by your office, Bureau expects that you will have coverage

sutticient to alert you to exile organizaional activities i political liâture,

..plots to overthrow existing governments, and general intelligence data

concerning the countries of interest. Intormant development in this field

is considered most important and any weaknesses which now exist must be

• overcome promptly by instituting an aggressive informant development

program.

John Edgar Hoover

Re:

OPERATIONS

LEGAL ATTACHE, SANTO DOMINGO OFFICE

In the case of DOM-12, this informant was originally

developed by the New York Office. Legal Attache suggested

the New York Office might have use of informant's services.

This information furnished to New York Office which replied

that in the absense of organized activity informant would be

of no use unless he came to New York with instructions from

Dominican communist groups to reorganize activity. This,

of course, is not a desirable situation.

OBSERVATIONS:

We believe Legal Attache, Santo Domingo's recommendation

to turn

even though Fk Act 6 (1) (B)

both of these sources are in a position to furnish valuable

intelligence information to us. By making these informants

available

we will avoid any possible duplicationt 6 (1)(B)

or conflict.

This matter should be discussed with appropriate

officials by our Liaison Agent in order to insure

Memorandum for Mr. McDermott

Re: REQUEST BY U. S. SENATOR WALTER F.

MONDALE, SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

MEMBER, TO REVIEW HIS FBI FILES

The Senator raised a question concerning a folder on the

Consumer's Advisory Council, of which he was a member (62-108230-1)

and inquired how we came into possession of this particular report. I

determined that this report had been sent to Mr. Hoover in September,

1962, by Richard Berlin, President of the Hearst Corporation, as he

felt Mr. Hoover would be interested in reading the report. I advised

Mr. Aaron that the report had been sent to Mr. Hoover by a friend of

his in the newspaper field.

authorizos the Attorney General to appoint officials "to

conduct.. investigations regarding official matters...as may

be directed by the Attorney General," A listing of any

directives issued by the Department or the Attorney General

with respect to organized crime should be available in the

offico of the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division,

With respect to the FBI,

the organized crime field are aimed at one ultimate objoctive:

Senate Select Committee, advised that he desires to interview the

following Agents: Donald P. Burgess, Robert W. Thomson, O. Richard

Hamilton, Charles T. Haynes and Alden F. Miller, all of the Atlanta Office.

Additionally, he requested that SA W. John Benton of the Knoxville Office

be made available in Atlanta. All interviews will be conducted on Tuesday,

7-22-75. The scope of the interviews will be the Bureau investigation of

Martin Luther King. K. William O'Connor, Special Counsel for Intelligence

Coordination in the Department, advised Assistant Director John A. Mintz

on 7-18-75 that staff interviews would no longer be considered a demand

and thus no longer necessitate a waiver of the Code of Federal Regulations

provisions concerning interviews.

After securing the approval of Robert H. Cahill of the

Administrative Division for the travel of Benton to Atlanta, SAC Harold C.

Swanson, Knoxville Office, was telephonically advised on 7-18-75 to

arrange that Benton be available in Atlanta, 7-22-75.

Attached is a copy of a Departmental memorandum which

interprets "demand" under 28 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 16.21

et seg. for the purpose of dealing with the Senate Select Committee. The

provisions of 16 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 16. 21 et seq. requires

Departmental approval in those instances where a current or former

employee in response to a demand of a court or authority is required

to furnish material contained in Departmental files or disclose information

contained therein.

The Department decision as set forth in the attachment.

characterizes all requests by Senate Select Committee staff members

as a demand which requires a waiver from the Department prior to the

lemployee's submission to the Committee request.

RECI. 02-114345-506

According to the Departmental position concerning demand,

the Director or "the FBI General Counsel" in coordination with the Special

Counsel for Intelligence Coordination of the Department may waive the

provision of 28 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 16.21 et sed. This

is in accordance with the provision of Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations.

Section 16.23.

14 AUG IX 1975

Upon receipt of the attached documents, SA Paul V. Daly

and Inspector John B. Hotis of this Division sought clarification concerning

the Departmental interpretation of "demand" as set forth in attachment,

including whether this interpretation applied to the General Accounting

Office (GAO) inquiry into the Bureau. K. William O'Connor, Special

Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, stated he believed this might also

apply to GAO, however, he had not really thought out this point. He was

also asked what was meant by the phrase, "in coordination with this office."

Mr. O'Connor indicated that he wanted to be notified of requests for interviews

and that was what he meant by the phrase, "in coordination with this office."

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams Memo

RE: SENSTUDY 75

He was advised by SA Daly that we had previously received requests

for the interview of a number of employees in Atlanta, Georgia, by the

Committee and that upon receipt of the attached communication, alter

consultation with Deputy Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination

Michael Shaheen, SA Daly had telephonically informed John Elliff, head

of the domestic intelligence task force for the Committee, of the

Department's interpretation as set forth in the attached document and

the fact that Mr. Elliff should contact Mr. O'Connor concerning these

proposed interviews. Mr. O'Connor said that he had been contacted by

Mr. Ellif and had, in fact, told Mr. Ellifi there would be no interviews.

In this regard, O'Connor stated the Department had prepared a proposed

draft letter to the Committee expressing concern for the Fifth Amendment

rights for Bureau employees and raising other legal issues. Mr. O'Connor

indicated that the finalized form of this letter should be sent to the

Committee in the near future.

The results of the conversation with John Elliff by O'Connor

have caused the Office of Legal Analysis to receive complaints concerning

this decision from various Committee staff members, including Mark

Gitenstein and Michael Epstein. We can anticipate, unless this particular

problem is resolved, receiving protests from their superiors on the

Committee.

RECOMMENDATION:

You will be kept advised of developments concerning this

matter. Legal Analysis Office will continue efforts to determine what

effect this will have on the GAO inquiry.

Interpretation of "Demand"

28 C.F.R., $ 16.21, et. seq. - Action Memorandum

The meaning of "demand" is not indicated, beyond subpoena, in

the C.F.R. sections indicated. This omission creates a need for an

interpretation, for purposes of uniform Department of Justice reaction.

Outlines for inquiry proceedings were agreed upon between the

White House and the Senate Select Committee on June 13, 1975, and a

copy of those procedures was furnished to the Department on June 16,

1975. Under those guidelines, there is a general undertaking by the

Cormittee to identify witnesses to the Agency a reasonable time belore

the interviews occur. This general rule includes current and former

employees; certain exceptions (not clearly defined) are indicated in

the guidelines. The Committee is required to provide the witness with

Since these structured procedures, taken with the rules of the

Subcommittee, may create a requirement of testimony upon witnesses, it

seems to me clear that the paragraphs of 28 C.F.R., 8 16.21, et. seg.

which refer to "demand" should be interpreted to include any request

by any Committee staff member to interview any employee, former employee

or other person connected with the Department of Justice.

This interpretation requires certain action: (1) that the wit-

ness be authorized to speak under § 16.23 by an appropriate Department

Official; and, (2) that an appropriate Department Official be designated.

I would think that the appropriate Department Official for the FBI should

be the Director of the FBI or the FBI General Counsel, in coordination

with this office.

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

On July 23, 1975, Mike Gitenstein, staff

requested that he

be given a briefing concerning

fidential" files.

By way of background, we furnished

a summary of the inspection inquiry to the Committee

by letterhead memorandum dated 7-16-75, and also

made available for review in Bureau space a list of

people contacted during the course of this inquiry.

With regard to Gitenstein's request it would

appear beneficial for

us to brief the Senate Select

Committee representative concerning the scope and

details of this inquiry.

In this regard it appears

Gitenstein is interested in those individuals who

were contacted by the Inspection Division during their

inspection into the "Official and Confidential"

files.

If approved the briefing will be tentatively

scheduled for Friday, July 25, 1975.

RECOMMENDATION:

That a briefing be arranged for Gitenstein

By memorandum dated June 24, 1975, you were

advised of the Department's intention to make a closed

Departmental file-available to captioned Committee.

The file contained the results of a criminal investigation

conducted by the Bureau.

The Intelligence, General

Investigative and Special Investigative Divisions were

requested to furnish their views concerning this matter

and the Legal Counsel Division was to prepare a letter

to the Department setting forth the Bureau's position

with regard to this matter.

We have since had discussions with the Attorney

General and other representatives of the Department concerning

Senate Select Committee access to Bureau files and

submitted correspondence to the Department concerning

this matter.

It would appear additional communications

to the Department are unnecessary. The Department is

well aware of our position in this matter.

RECOMMENDATION:

We do not prepare a communication to the

Department concerning this matter.

551186

On August 7, 1975, Assistant Director Robert E.

Gebhardt, Los Angeles Division, was interviewed in the Los

Angeles

FBI Office by Mr. Lester Seidel, Staff Member of

the Senate Select Committee, United States Senate.

Gebhardt's rights were not explained to him by

Seidel although Seidel did explain the purpose of the

interview, that is, the Gaintel Progran of the FBI as it.

we demon set on in ca Black Pthe Sa Party.

The interview lasted from 9:05 AM until 10:30 AM,

and it was not necessary for Gebhardt to consult with any

Bureau representative.

Gebhardt had previously been advised by a Bureau

of interview.

Seidel inquired at the outset as to whether Gebhardt

was aware of the Cointel Program relative to the Black Panther

Party investigation on a day-to day basis being specifically

advised details of the investigation as it relates to the

, Cointel Program.

It was explained to Seidel that as Special

Agent in Charge of

:the San Francisco FBI Office wherein

over 500 employees were located at the time, Gebhardt had

many responsibilities in the operation of that division and

therefore,

relied upon the experience, expertise, and judgment

of the various supervisors assigned to the office for the

day-to-day direction of the various matters under investigation,

including the investigation of the Black Panther Party.

It was further explained that if a problem was

encountered or a particularly unusual situation developed,

Gebhardt was, of course, consulted and was available for

such consultation to resolve any particular problem areas.

Gebhardt was next asked if he recalled being SAC

when the electronic coverage of the Black Panther Party and

the various officials at BBP was instituted and eventually

terminated.

Seidel was advised that the electronic coverage

vas handed down instructing that all electronic coverage of

the BPP and the

• various members of the BPP be discontinued.

The call was received from Bureau Headquarters and the

discontinuance was effected immediately.

Seidel inquired as to whether Gebhardt felt the

intelligence type investigations should be completely

"removed

from the criminal investigations which investigations would be

looking toward eventual prosecution.

Seidel was informed by Gebhardt that even in criminal

investigations looking toward prosecutions, much intelligence

Insofar as the FBI is concerned, however, every effort is

made to make certain there is some Federal law which would be

a basis for an investigation which procedures would include

matters commonly referred to as security investigations.

a great deal of intelligence information would be obtained

gence type investigations should not be removed from or

toward enrosecutions since intelligence information is a

outgrowth of the basic investigation.

HH 55116 Do0Id:32989627 Page 270

Gebhardt was asked if he felt the Cointelpro was a

separate entity distinguished from the basic investigation

and it was explained that the Cointelpro was a phase of the

overall investigation in any particular organization or

individual.

Gebhardt was asked if he felt Congress should enact

legislation which would set torth specific investigative

techniques that could or could not be utilized by the FBI or

other Federal investigative agencies. He was advised in

Gebhardt's opinion, such legislation should not be enacted,

and in reply to the question as to why such legislation shoul

not be enacted, it was pointed out that as an investigative

bility, there must of necessity be allowed a certain flexi.

• because no two investigations are exactly alike and the

circumstances of such investigations could possibly not be

related to such Federal law.

In answer to the question as to how Congress should

assure the American public that questionable activity such

as the Cointelpro, was not being engaged in by an investigative

agency such as the FBI, Seidel was informed that the Congress

and the American people must rely upon the integrity and

honesty of the Director of the FBI and the Attorney General.

It was pointed out that both the Director of the

FBI and the Attorney General are nominated by the President,

hearings are held before the various Congressional Committees

and tinally approved by the senate.

It was further pointed

out that Director Kelley has recently stated in connection with

the publicity relative to Cointelpro, that he has no intention

of permitting this program to be reinstituted in the FBI and

II circumstances ever arose which circumstances he could not

this time, wherein it was thought such

activities shöuld be embarked upon, he would obtain the personal

approval of the Attorney General prior to such instituting.

Seidel was informed that Gebhardt was in total agreement with

this statement of Mr. Kelley.

Gebhardt was asked as to what his feelings were

relative to what the relationship should be between the FBI

and Congress.

He was informed that a Senate Oversight

Committee was recently established and it was felt that this

was a good start and that this Committee should formalize and

- 3 -

НН 55116 DooId:32989627 Page 271

---

## Page 272

.,**

standardize their oversight responsibilities and make regular

inquiries of the Director and other officials of the FBI as

to our activities. He was informed that there should be

either a joint oversight committee between the House and

Senate or if the Congress decided on two oversight Committees

In both the House and Senate, these committees should be the

entities through which all information relative to the

activities of the FBI should flow.

It was emphasized however, that there should be

regular consultation between these representatives and the

FBI.

Inquiry was made as to Gebhardt's opinion relative

to the relationship between the Department of Justice and

the FBI and Seidel was informed the relationship, in Gebhardt's

opinion, is excellent, should continue, and there should be

a free flow ôf information between the FBI and the Department

of Justice.

At the conclusion of the interview, Gebhardt summed

up his comments by stating that Congress should definitely

set up

a structured oversight procedure of the activities

of the FBI with due regard to the confidentiality of many

of the FBI operations and investigations and must assure

itself that the members of the Committee and its staff will

maintain the confidentiality where necessary.

Secondly, in the areas of investigative matters

usually referred

to as national defense, national security

or intelligence operations, all of the FBI investigations

must be based on the application of the facts toward a

statute, consultation with the Department of Justice shoul

be had in all instances.

expressed her disapproval of O'Flaherty's action. He concluded

by saying that upon determination of his niece's decision in

this regard he would immediately advise the Philadelphia Office.

The above information, if accurate, represents a

serious violation of the

agreerent regarding confidentiality

existing between the SSC and members of the intelligence commu-

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re:

Senstudy 75

62-116395

upon this Bureau to make the above information available at

the earliest logical time and in the most complete form

possible to the Department, CIA, and Senators Frank Church

and John G. Tower of the SSC. Accordingly, an interview by

Bureau Agents of Thweat's niece, if she agrees to cooperate,

would appear desirable before initiating any action on the

basis of information received to date.

Additionally, it is not known at this time whether

or not the document reportedly Xeroxed by O'Flaherty is

classified. In our continuing inquiry into this matter,

attempts will be made to identify document, determine whether

it contains classified information and ascertain whether or

not a violation of Federal statutes exists.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. That contact be maintained with the Philadelphia

Office to insure that the desired information concerning

Thweat's niece be expeditiously obtained. If she agrees to

cooperate, she will be immediately interviewed and pertinent

information obtained

furnished, via established liaison

channels, to the Department, CIA, and Senators Church and Tower.

Appropriate field offices

will be instructed to conduct

necessary investigation to corroborate the information and

to determine if a possible violation of Federal statutes has

been committed.

8/5/75

The Intelligence Division advised Philadelphia Office

telephonically informed FBIHQ on 8/5/75 that Thweat had returned to

Philadelphia from seeing his niece and indicated she would talk to the

FBI on the condition that she would go to Philadelphia about 8/22/75

to talk to the Agent who is a personal friend of Thweat and to whom

he initially confided the information regarding this matter. Philadelphia

was advised in view of the time lag a more preferable alternative

would be for WEO Agents to contact the niece or as another alternative the

Philadelphia Agent would travel.to Washington, D. C., to conduct

the interview. Philadelphia was requested to expeditiously recontact

Thweat concerning the above possibilities.
