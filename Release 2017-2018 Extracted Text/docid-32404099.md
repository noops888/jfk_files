Further Clarification

172-233, 169-137, and 118<125

Clarification:

($) 1. The CIA is continuing to postpone the release of the

aliases officially.registered for Anatoliy Golitsyn and his family.

The Agency does not. want to officially acknowledge and link the name

Golitsyn to this alias. To do so could jeopardize Golitsyn's current

relocation program, which in turn could cause harm to Golitsyn and

his family. Further, the Agency does not want to endanger the

current method of registering aliases. The agreements with various

federal agencies and the methods of operations used in issuing

aliases are current ones which are used on routine basis by the

Agency.

15) 2. Regarding Mangold's Cold Warrior, this book was not

it does not constitute an "official" release of information.

It

important to note that only Golitsyn's first and last name in alias

were exposed in this book; not the full (first, middle, and last)

names of all three members of his

family.

(p)

3. Golitsyn has continued to adhere to the stipulations of

his Memorandum of Agreement not to divulge his relationship with this

Agency.

Given Golitsyn's performance regarding secrecy to date, the

Agency has an obligation to honor in kind by protecting the current

identity of Golitsyn and his family. The recruitment of sources of

high intelligence value has always been one of this Agency's top

priorities.

For individuals such as Golitsyn, who have placed their

trust in the Agency by entering our relocation program, and are now

Us citizens, living in the US, the indiscriminate release of

information seriously erodes this Agency's credibility and undermines

our programs.
