Re New York airtel, 10/12/67.

MM 676-C advised on 10/31/67 that JIMMY PALACINA,

a shylock, advised that PALACINA has a nephew in New York

who is a lieutenant of JOE BONNANOS and that this nephew

had control of BONNANOS' organization during the period

that BONNANOS was in hiding.

Informant stated that

PALACINA refers to this nephew as "SMITHY" and the informant

has no further identifying data other than the fact that

"SMITHY" is preparing for a large wedding for his daughter

to take place in New York in a couple of weeks.

Informant advised that PALACINA told him that

when BONNANOS returned to New York, there was a split in

the BONNANOS "family" and that the

group that was in power

during BONNANOS' absence, which group included "SMITHY", was

not going to allow BONNANOS to regain his' former power.

PALACINA advised informant that a gang war was expected

because of this fight for power and that PALACINA was en-

deavoring to obtain weapons for "SMITHY" in this regard.
