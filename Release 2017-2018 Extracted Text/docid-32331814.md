discuss the theft of weapons at the ONG Armory at Canton.

PCI could not recall MARTINEZ calling the Varsity Restaurant

in 9-58, from NY, however, a couple days before MARTINEZ

was arrested in NY for kidnapping, MARTINEZ telephoned

the Varsity Restaurant and asked to talk to ALEX KARRAS,

the bartender, who takes messages for FLOREA and MESSARIS

when they are not there.

KARRAS is a loyal member of the

gang and cannot be trusted according to PCI.

KARRAS

later mentioned that MARTINEZ wanted money when he

called and it was his opinion that the money was requested

of FLOREA.

PCI stated that FLOREA has not been around

for several weeks and was working with PHIL MAINER at Calumet

City, Ill. FLOREA gave a telephone number of TO 2-9628 where

he could be rached, which isprobably the "Riptide" bar in

that city. MAINER is from the Youngstown, 0. area, and a

known hoodlum.

FLOREA is a suspect in the case entitled,
