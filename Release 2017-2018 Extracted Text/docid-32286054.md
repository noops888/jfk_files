Re Bonn cable 12/9/63.

The Bundeskriminalamt - (BKA - West German Federal

Criminal Police) has advised of receipt of the following

from the Munich Police:

FUEGER and her mother left the Bayerischer Hof Hotel

in Munich about noon on December 8, 1963, en route to Riederau.

At the hotel she reported the loss of a platinum neck chain

with a heart-shaped locket containing diamonds of approximately

three

carats.

FUEGER did not make a formal complaint or

report of theft to the police.

It appears she advised hotel

employees she would first check in America to see if she may

have left the jewelry there.

ALEX has not been seen. No

significant contact of FUEGER observed.
