objection for Mr. Belin to do whatever is desired with

these photographs at this time. It should be noted that

Mr. Fensterwald in 1971 - 1972 was actually shown, by

Mr. Houston during a visit to the Agency, two of the

twelve photographs, other than the one already published

in the Warren Commission report..

he has published in The New York Review of Books article

It seems to me that whoever makes a decision on

whether the entire matter can be fully disclosed at this

also be made, i.e., whether to crop or otherwise

the background of the photographs or, alternatively, to

publish the entire run of the photographs for the first

time without taking out the background..

stands. Perhaps after that, the question of what could

My personal

recommendation is that the more we can say about this

matter in a fully open and final manner, the better off

we will be as an Agency.

But it is my understanding

that there are still

sensitive aspects deriving from

fact that the operation which produced the photographs

at that level in Mexico.

Also, it should be noted that

the Ambassador, according to Win Scott's memorandum to

J.C. King on 22 November 1963 (see Item 8 in the backup

documentation), allegedly played a direct role in the

decision to put the photographs into the hands of the FBI

in Dallas laterally from

the Field. As far as I know,

there has not been anything published about this aspect

at any time

in the past nor have we had any discussions
