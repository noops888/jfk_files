something Constructive. This G111 recently, a few yeare

or 1ass ago Made a trip to the Soviet Union ete on the

Youth Conference Know as the world Youth Conference.

He will probably emerge from the New York thing as a

full time organiser in sone special fleld suchas youth.

At the start of the Meeting Genne brought out

her brief case full of clippligs (Newspaper) ete she

also had a lot of penciled notes which she was

undoubtedly going to use to show what she was doing

and to give others hell for not co-operating with her.

But the first discussion by A. Johnson centered around

the late Pres. Kennedy.

Arnold explained that since Oswald was Considered a

Communist then a wave of hysteria was about to explode

that it had been disclosed that it seemed like the

right had been active.

This was bore out

by the declaration of hussia that it was not the

C. party that had done 1t because Kennedy was a

friend of the Working class but the work of the extreme

right or almost a fascist act. This seemed to sober

the masses that it was the same caliber of people who

had insulted Stevenson only Weeks before in Dallas,

Texas.

Arnold stated he was asked by C.B.S. News about this

Oswald as to a letter he had written to the party, he

told them he gets loss of letters of enquiry about the

C. party and he probably answered it as he does hundreds

of others and even sent him literature if he requested

It. They (C.B.S.) wanted him to go on the air with a

statement but he stated to them he would have to dig th

letter out andibe sure before he Made any statement.

Randal Corby asked: Arnold Johnson 1f when be got back to

New York to look in the files if he had a letter from &

Wn Pokas, formerly from Bellaire, Ohio, and also an

inmate of Cambridge Asylum for a period of time, Gorby

asked Johnson to compare the letter of pokey's with

Oswald's to see if they didn't have a lot in Conmon.

Palmer stated that he thought

the statement by the

Methodist Minister Covered the situation very good

when he stated that the fact that the Murder of Bil1

Moore, M Edgar Evers and others in the south going

by without punishment had set the stage for the

Assassination of Pres. Remedy.

Everyone readily

agreed.

Arnold Johnson further stated that no real Marxist

Could do such & thing There 1s not Much doubt that

since the soviet Union had expelled him by not

giving him a Citizenship in the Soviet Union because

they thought him to be an Agent of Fascist.. Gene

Meanwhile was Chomping at the bit trying to get her

story told about the N.A.A.C.P. and CORE.

she finally got her Chance

to unload.

She stated that about the time of the Civil Rights

March on Washington a few days before she had been

working with CORE and NAACP the reporter from the

Wheeling paper Intelligencer had Called and

wanted

to talk about her.

She gave him answers on

the

phone and finally hung up on him.

from the time

this phone conversation was completed She had been

quoted in the newspaper and exposed as a Commumist

party Member, which brought about her expolsion fron

the N.A.A.C.P., but since has been restored to

Membership.

Then lately a Man (Negro) by name of Johnson

head of the local core group was indicted for robbing a

bus

driver In steubenville, Onio

Genne had got In

touch with R. Gorby as she

thought Johnson was being

framed.

Gorby found out and told her at this Meeting

that he had did the robbing and was

Not being framed.

The best thing to do stated Gorby was to give him

help but do not put core and the NAACP out on a limb

by doing it..
