There are attached hereto six copies of a

letterhead memorandum containing additional information

concerning TANCREDI and PARIGI TORTORA, which may be of

assistance to Legat. Rome in the interviews of these men.

TANCREDI TORTORA should be interviewed concerning

the shooting of ANTONIO CHARLANDO in Chicago, Illinois in

1922 and the identities of the five men arrested immediately

after the shooting should be ascertained. It is probable

that one of these men was TANCREDI TORTORA and it is possible

that one of them was JOHN ROSSELLI. If, in fact, one of the

was ROSSELLI, this could be the reason he has so carefully

guarded his identity.

TANCREDI TORTORA should also be

specifically interviewed concerning his arrest in Chicago

in April, 1922 on a narcotics charge and the identities of

the two other men arrested at the same time should be

established.nuts.co

Both TANCREDI and PARIGI TORTORA should be requested

to furnish the names of as many persons as they can who are

aware of ROSSELLI's dual identity.
