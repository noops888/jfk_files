SUBJECT:

PURPOSE

To recommend that Pittsburgh be authorized to install

a microphone surveillance on Top Hoodlum Sebastian John

La Rocca.

BACKGROUND'

"La Rocca is a national top hoodlum. He and the notorious

Mannarino Brothers have dominated racket activities in the Pittsburgh

and Western Pennsylvania area since the 1930's. La Rocca attended

the meeting of hoodlums at Apalachin, New York, in 1957 and was

from our highly

confidential source in Chicago concerning an underworld "commission."

He operates the North Star Cement Block Co. at Ingomar, a

suburb of Pittsburgh, and daily conducts his operations at this

company. Informants

and reliable sources have advised this company

is the scene of many decisions affecting Western Pennsylvania

racketeers.

RESULTS OF SURVEY

Pursuant to Bureau authority, Pittsburgh conducted

survey to determine the feasibility of

establishing microphone

coverage at the cement company to obtain information as to La Rocca's

daily racketeering activities, his associates, financial status

and his connection with top hoodlums in order parts of the country.

Pittsburgh advises such coverage is feasible through the use of a

radio-microphone technique.

The installation will be monitored

at the Pittsburgh Office central plant by personnel already assigned

to the central plant.

The leased line to be used will cost

approximately $17.50 per month.

Trespass will be involved but

Pittsburgh Has advised no unusual risks will ensue.
