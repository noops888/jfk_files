BOSCHI is depending upon ALPIZAR to assist him in

carrying out these new plans.

He again desires ALPIZAR tO

serve as che plane pilot,

Cuba, LAREDO RODRIGUEZ, in transporting arms and explosives

to Andros Island in the Bahamas for concealment. BOSCH

plans to set up a base on Andros Island for his boat and the

plane,

neither of which has yet been acquired.

He desires

ALPIZAR to handle the problem of obtaining an Aero-Commander

plane.

BOSCH has told ALPIZAR he plans to use the boat in

and the

BOSCH told ALPIZAR he las decided not to deal with

any Americans, such as WILLIAM JOHNSON and CHARLES BUSCH,

both of whom were involved in preparations for the 12/28/53

raid. BOSCH has indicated complete confidence

ALPIZAR, Whe

has been very adroit in avoiding suspicion.

ALPIZAR also has learned frow BOSCH that che

Comandos I group is planning an independent raid against

Cuba by boat in the imnediate futuce.: ALPIZAR stands a good

chance of obtaining more

info about this by continuing his

association with BOSCH.

ALPIZAR doubts the value of any such raid as planned

by BOSCH.

He also has confidence

the FBl and believes

it is his duty to cooperace. & (S)(u)

In order for ALPIZAR to acquire this information

he has to associate with BOSCH at the expense of neglecting

his personal affairs.

He is in the business of repairing

air conditioners and other eleccrical equipment. We also

gives private flying lessons.

He has

gotten behind in some

of his expenses, and faces loss of his telephone service.

He will be unable to continue close association with BOSCH

at this

critical time

Leos he can be compensated for his

loss of time.

This office, to date, has paid him a total of

$350,00 out of a total $400.00

authorized by the Bureau.

An additional $50.00 will be paid to him 3/27/64, which will

exhaust the current authorization. de (DU)

Alpizas alceady has proved his productivity and

reliability.

His position with BOSCH is unique because of

his qualifications as a pilot and a vececan of previous raide.

It is because of his background as a man of action and ac-

venturer that he is able to cultivate the confidence of

BOSCH.

Miami feels these characteristics should be regarded

as an aövantage in assessing him as a PSI.

With regard to ALPIZAR's treatment in the psychi-

atric section of Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami, In 1959

and again. in 1960, it is noted his doctor, MIGUEL

A. MORA,

was also nis doctor at the time of his confinement, advised

on 2/11/64 that ALPIZAR has recovered from his previous

state of depression, and is leading a normai life, unlike.
