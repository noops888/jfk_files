In August, 1963, CARMINE/LOMBARDOZZI and ARTHUR TORTORELLO MY

were returned to U.S. District Court in New Haven for a

Laniel

hearing to determine if they had violated the terms of their

federal probation.

During the hearing, which lasted for a few days, a PCI O

the New Haven Division, who has turnished very reliable

information in the past, advised he was contacted on two

occasions by RALPH TROPIANO and an ARTHUR J. LADINOLAI. a CAME

New Haven hoodlum, who indicated to the PCI that they were

interested in LOMBARDOZZI from the standpoint of his making

bond and if bond were possible, TROPIANO stated to the PCI

that he would be responsible for LOMBARDOZZI's bond.

It developed that bond in this matter was not allowable to

LOMBARDOZZI and be remained in custody of the Government

until 8/23/63, at which time he and TORTORELLO admitted in

U,S. District Court, before U.S. District Court Judge ROBERT P.
