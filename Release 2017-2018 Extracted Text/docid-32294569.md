6. 'I EXPRESSED DISMAY TO WILLS OVER THE DEVELOPMENT

I REMINDED HIM OF OUR COOPERATION. HE SUGGESTED THAT

I FIND A WAY TO TALK TO BURNHAM. WILLS ASKED,

HOWEVER, THAT I NOT LET BURNHAM KNOW I HAD LEARNED

OF THE PNC DEMONSTRATION FROM THE FONMIN'S OFFICE.

7. COMMENT: A BRITISH OFFICIAL SOURCE TOLD ME

THIS MORNING THAT A GUYANESE OFFICIAL AHD REPORTED

THAT WILLS, FOLLOWING HIS INVESTIGATION TRIP, HAD

PALYED UPON BURNHAMÂ®S SUSPICIONS OF "IMPERIALIST"

INVOLVEMENT IN THE CUBANA CRASH. BUT IF WILLS IS

PALY ING A DOUBLE GAME, HE IS DOING SO EXTREMELY

CONVINCINGLY. HIS ANGER AT BEING INFORMED OF THE

DEMONSTRATION APPEARED GENUINE. I LEARNED DURING

A MEETING AT MID-DAY WITH BURNHAM THAT THE

DECISIONTO PICKET THE EMBASSY HAD BEEN TAKEN

DURING A PNC PARTY MEETING DURING THE NIGHT.

CONFIDENTIAL
