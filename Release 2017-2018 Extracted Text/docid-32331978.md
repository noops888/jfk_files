Pittsburgh newspapers on June 25, 1959, carried articles

concerning the arrest of JOE MEROLA by

the U. S. Border

one ROBERT ELLIOTT SPINING, age 34, of Hialeah, when they

landed in a rented airplane

shortly after dropping off

General ROBERTO FERNANDEZ MIRANDA at Bronara Airport,

Fort Lauderdale.

Previous investigation indicates that MIRANDA, son-in-law

of former Cuban President, FULGENCIO BATISTA,

close to ALBERT ARDURA MOYA, former operator of the

Tropicana Night Club, and NORMAN ROTHMAN.

For background information concerning this phase of the
