v 1994) (the Act) (copy enclosed) wassenacted by the United States Congress and signed into law. by

President George Bush on October 26, 1992. The purpose of the Act is to preserve and maintain all'

United States governmental documents in one area, the National Archives-and Records

Administration (Archives, for access to those individuals interested in the history surrounding the

assassination of President John F Kennedy. The Act states that, "la]li' government records

concerning the assassination of President John F. Kennedy should carry a presumption of immediate,

disclosure,? and requires all United States gövernment agencies to find all documents related to the

Director Santiago Y. Toledo.

(S)

Ifyour agency has no objection to the release of its information in the enclosed records, please.

notify the FBI so that we may take steps to release the records to the Archives. If your agency

determines. that the information cannot be released, please provide an explanation so that the FBI may

present the evidence to the Board for their approval The Act requires the FBI to present "clear and

convincing evidence." of a harm that would outweigh the need for public disclosure to the Board for

any information that we request to protect from disclosure. Such evidence to protect information is

explained in the Act as

"the public disclosure of the assassination record would compromise the

existence of an understanding of confidentiality currently requiring protection between a Góvérnment

agent and a cooperating individual or a foreign government, and public disclosure would be so

harmful that it outweighs the public interest." Upon receipt of your instructions and'explanation for

the protection from disclosure,

, the FBI will provide the information to the Board and request that

they sustain the request for, withholding the information from disclosure:

Please be aware that the Act requires that all information in the assassination collection at

Archives (even in the closed section) be released to the public in the year 2017, including information

thạt the Board agrees to protect. The Act has provisions to extend postponements (protection of

information from disclosure) past 2017 with the certification of the President of the United States that

the information continues to meet the requirements for postponement. The FBI will periodically

review the postponed material for the need of this certification

As you know, the FBI normally protects information from your agency pursuant to applicable

Executive Orders and the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts exemptions: However, the Act is

a unique Federal law that applies only to JFK assassination records. Please note, it is our opinion that

release of information in the JFK assassination records should not in the future affect the FBI's

standard policy of protecting your agency's information in other investigations or in other contexts.

The FBI is committed to the opening of all information related to the assassination to the

United States public,,but appreciates that certain information is sensitive and not proper for release

Thereföre, the FBI requests.your,consideration and understanding of this matter and the continuance:

of your outstanding association with our agency

Thank you, in advance, for your cooperation. Please direct any questions to our Legat Office

representative of to Carol L. Keeley, Acting Unit Chief of the Historical and Executive Review Unit"

of the FBI, 935 Pennsylvania Avenue, N. W, Washington, D.C. 20535, (202) 324÷0671
