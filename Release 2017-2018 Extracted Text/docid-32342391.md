MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Frank Anthony STURGIS (201-242256)

This morning I received a phone call

from

the COS, Miami who advised me that yesterday

Frank Sturgis called the DCD, Miami Office DiD

expressed

a desire to meet with one of the

officers.

Sturgis claimed to have new information

on the

movement of narcotics through Mexico and

other information which he did not specify.

The DCD Miami Office thanked Sturgis for

calling and referred him to the FBI. and DEA,

who would be the most interested recipients of

the information he has.

Sturgis was very pleasant

on the telephone and the DCD people obviously

responded correctly.
