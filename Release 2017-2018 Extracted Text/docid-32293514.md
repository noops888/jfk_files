ReBulet,, 1/28/63, to New York and numerous other offices. :

Concerned with the investigation of "Causa Nostra," San Francisco

has noted the use of this term in numerous communications by

Eastern offices where the information obviously came from

misur coverage.

Since SF-2550-C-TE states that the correct

wording and spelling is

"Cossa Nostra"_--meaning "our thing,"

rather than "our

cause," could it be possible that we have

taken the phonetic word as heard over misurs and given it the

wrong spelling and the wrong meaning?

It is the understanding of the San Francisco Office that the

word, "coe."

"Causa," in Italian would be

pronounced "cow" rather

If the offices receiving copies of this com-

munication have nun into this situation where the connect

word is "cossa"

rather than "causa," it would be appreciated

if they would promptly notify both

the Bureau and San Francisco.

These offices could very easily obtain this information from

the employees who monitor the misurs.
