On June 29, 1962, NH T-4 reported that the name FRANK

PICCOLO, 220 East 23rd Street, with telephone number

MU 9-0160, was found among the personal effects of CARLO:

GAMBINO in that his name was found on a business card for

the Consolidated Reserach and manufacturing corporation,

1181 Chapel street, New Haven, Connecticut, MARViN BOlwiCK,

President.

It is known and it has been reported to the Bureau and

New York that PICCOLO has admitted to two agents of the

New Haven Division that he was associated in business with

the Consolidated Research and Manufacturing Corporation,

which at one time had offices both in New York and in New

Haven, as a salesnan. PICCOLO further advised that his

office in New York. City with the Consolidated Research

Corporation was located at 220 East 23rd Street.

It is known through interviews with MARVIN BOTWICK, former

President of Consolidated Research, now deceased, that

BOTWICK had personal relations with PICCOLO and strongly

indicated that PICCOLO had offered the Consolidated Research

Corporation financial assistance.

On December 21, 1962, Special Agent WINTHROP A. YOUNG of

New Haven contacted NH Tos In Bridgeport, connecticut, who

furnished the following information:

Recently ANGELO CULMO, allegedly the "head man" of the

rackets in Ansonia, Connecticut, died and there was con-

sternation as to who would replace him.

On December 22,

the son of ANGELO CULMO and NICHOLAS PATTI, also

1962' the Ansonia, Connecticut, area, came to the informantis

place of business along with FRANK PICCOLO.

Several tele-

phone calls were made from informant's teephone by PICCOLO

who remarked to the informant that he was straightening out

the Ansonia situation,

as to who should have control. In

formant believed the

calls were to New York.

It was determined that only two toll calls to New York

City were made on December 20, 1962, from informant's

phone and both were to New York, Number 212 - RE 7-1588.

The New York Office determined that RE 7-1588 is listed to

and the owner of this store is JOSEPH ARCURI, 311
