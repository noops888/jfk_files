Interpen is headed by Gerald Patrick Hemming and

we are well aware

of his recent activities. This group was formerly known as the

Anticommunist Legionnaires. The members have reportedly been living

in the Everglades on snakes and swamp cabbage and have no housing.

Miami has an informant in the organization who is an aide to Hemming

and who has reported that the group consists of mercenaries, vagrants,

adventurers and unreliable delinquents with an average age of about

22 years. Informant stated the group seeks publicity; has no arms,

equipment or transportation; is not accepted in the Cuban revolutionary

movement; and informant does not anticipate any expedition by the

group.

Recently this group engaged in parachute jumping in the Miami

area

for publicity purposes.

A number of members of Interpen have been arrested by local

authorities on charges of vagrancy. Local authorities have stated

these individuals have made a nuisance of themselves. One of those

arrested in July was an individual named George Williams. Finegan

advised the Subcommittee that he has used several names while

associated with Interpen, one of which is George Williams.

The

George Williams who,was arrested by local authorities was described

as a salesman.

United States statutes.

Information concerning Interpen and Hanard received in the

past has been furnished to the Department and interested agencies.
