opening of a luncheonette at 900 South Sth Street, Philadelphia,

and install mieur coverage under this pretext has been reviewed

at the Bureau.

It is believed that such a procedure could possibly

raise serious security problens which nay jeopardize our

sensitive sources.

The Bureau does not desire that anyone

outside of the Buzenu be made aware of our confidential

techniques.

•By placing two men in the informant's Zuncheonette,

the possibility of misur coverage at this location could be

brought to the informant's attention, particularly in view

of your recent discussions with hin regarding the wearing of

a concealed tape recorder.

It is also noted that it has not as yet been

established that Philadelphia La Cosa Nostra nonbers will

congregece as the Lunchooncece and, cheretore, the pocontia.

ox e misur at this locatzon has not boch deteruined.

The Bureau appreciates your desire to obtain

significant crininal

intelligence information by establishing

misur at 900 and 902 South Sch Street, Philadolphia,

However,

in view of the above tactors, auchority not franted to do so

at the present time.

In tho event you develop additional

information which would justify misur coverage at these

locations, you may resubuit your recommendations.

NOTE:

A top level informant of the PHO is opening a luncheonette

with the approval of Angelo Bruno, leader of La Cosa Nostra in

Pi, in an area frequented by many La Cosa Nostra members. The

luncheonette is adjacent to the barbershop which serves as a hangout

for many PH hoodlums.

PHO proposes that 2 SAs assist CI in preparing

Luncheonette for opening, at which time misur could be established.

It is felt that PH's request should be denied at this time for two

reasons (1) serious security problems which could jeopardize confider-

tial technigues and possibility informant would lean of our

Phila. airtel 5/25/64 entitled "PH 672-С-TЕ, To

Echelon Criminal Informant Program,"

furnished resume of

recent information furnished from

this source.

Included

this communique was informant's efforts to open luncheonette

in the vicinity of 8th and Christian Sts., Phila., and a

request for lump sum payment of $300.00 to assist informant

in this regard.

Bureau by letter 5/27/64 entitled "pH 672-C-TE,

Top Echelon Criminal Informant Program,"

authorized payment

of $300.00 as requested, plus authority to continue payments

to informant on C.O.D. basis up to $325.00 per month.

On 5/27/64 informant advised he had made initial

payment of rent in the amount of $65.00 and thereby secured

control of the first floor of the vacant property at 900

S. 8th St., Phila.

He will obtain equipment for operation

of this luncheonette from his brother.

He and his brother,

SAM SCAFIDI, member of La Cosa Nostra, formerly operated

a luncheonette near this address.

PHILADELPHIA fA

The $300.00 payment to the Informant will give hi

an opportunity to fraternize with La Cosa Nostra membership

in the immediate area.

AlSo, it is believed this affords

Phila. a unique opportunity to obtain technical coverage at

to make installation at both 900 and 902S. 8th Street for

reasons included therein. Phila. can undertake this endeavor

during the week of June

renting the addrear at soo & ith smant was successful 17

It is proposed that 902 S. 8th St. be covered by

use of a mite or similar unit used for penetrating a wall.

There will be no trespass of 902 S. 8th St.; however, during

the crucial period of time when wall will be drilled, phila.

Agents can be in MAIORIELLO's barber shop to furnish direction

to sound personnel who would be actually performing the task.

Informant has been told that two individuals,

identities unknown to the informant, will help him paint

and make necessary preparation for opening the luncheonette.

The informant will tell his associates these men are indi-

viduals he met when living in the Willow Grove, Pa. area.

The two individuals will, of course, be sound trained Agents.

Phila. is at a disadvantage in that two of the sound

trained Agents are known by sight in the vicinity of 8th and

Christian Sts. It is, therefore, requested that the Bureau

authorize a sound trained Agent from a nearby office to assisti

SA JAMES FINLEY in this regard. SA FINLEY is a resident agentl

at Doylestown and could answer

any questions asked of him by

any associates of informant.

It is proposed that the coverage of 900 s. 8th St.

will be undertaken with the use of a "ZAM" unit or with a

"mate" unit being placed in the actual telephone network.

These two types of coverage can furnish the best security

available.

It is believed that sound Agents will not be

jeopardized in any way.

Phila. Agent personnel can be in

the area without compromising the sound Agents' position.

It is believed that under these conditions complete security

can be afforded. The actual installation would be over a

two or three day period while painting and other chores are

being performed.

these Agents will be alone in the store,

which is

at present vacant.

The potential of these sources, if authorized and

successfully installed, cannot-be over-emphasized.

DATE: 11-14-2017

Type of case involved: Anti-Racketeering re La Cosa Nostra.

?. Connection or status of subject in the case: SCAFIDI is a member

of La Cosa Nostra.

He has approval of ANGELO BRUNO to open

luncheonette at 900 S. 8th St., Phila. with stipulation that

SCAFIDI's wife

operate same so

that SCAFIDI will have steady

legitimate employment, enabling him to satisfy probationary

requirements.

It is contemplated La Cosa Nostra associates

Of SCAFIDI will use this establishment as a hang-out, particu-

larly during the evening and weekend hours when informant will

be present.

• 8. Specific information being sought: Identify members of La Cosa

Nostra and their illegal activities. Informant will associate

with the lower echelon members of La Cosa Nostra at irs tant

address. Considering possibility of incarceration of BRUNO

in the

near future, some of this lower echelon could be under-

taking policy making positions in La Cosa Nostra.

9. Reasons for believing the specific information will be obtained by the

technical

surveillance:

FRANK MONTE and FRANK NARDUCCI, both

known members of La Cosa Nostra have promised informant they

will hang out at his luncheonette if he is successful in opening

same for business.

There are other luncheonettes in the area

but this will be

the only luncheonette operated by a La Cosa

Nostra member in the neighborhood most frequented by La Cosa

Nostra

members and their associates.

10. Importance of case and subject:

Subject is a low ranking member

of La Cosa Nostra; however,

technical coverage will verify in-

formation he furnishes.

Will also furnish coverage during day

hours and while he is not present. Individuals who will frequent

this place are those who are actively engaged in illegal activities

of La Cosa Nostra group, such as gambling, loan sharking, etc.

11. Possibilities of obtaining desired information by other means

(Explain in detail): Considering that ANGELO BRUNO has

i in

structed informant to obtain legitimate employment, thereby

necessitating the informant be away from his criminal associates

during the day hours, there is no other means of obtaining this

information in as complete detail as would be available by

technical coverage. It will be a check on the informant,

realizing he will not know that installation is going to be

made. His membership in La Cosa Nostra will be a drawing card

to other members of La Cosa Nostra to frequent this location.

He has indicated that among the members they frequently discuss

previous illegal activities, including murders they have committed.

12. Risks of detection involved:

It is contemplated that coverage

of 900 s. 8th st., Phila., will be a ZAM unit which afforas more

security than any other type installation available.

This unit

is not even recognized by trained telephone personnel.

Probable length of technical surveillance:

90 day trial period.
