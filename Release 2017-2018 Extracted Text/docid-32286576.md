States

On 11/14/57 subject attended the meeting of hoodlums

at Apalachin, New York, and prior thereto had been in

New York City allegedly in contact with ALBERT ANASTASIA,

purportedly handling arrangements between prominent

Cubans and ANASTASIA concerning Havana casinos.

Subject

returned to Havana, Cuba, after the meeting and only

returned to the United States for his income tax wagering

matters, which resulted in his acquittal in United States

District Court at Jacksonville, Florida, December 11,

1959. He thereafter again returned to Cuba and allegedly

lost out with the change from the BATISTA to the CASTRO

regime, as tourist trade fell off.

He then returned to

Tampa for his public appearance about 5/10/60.

In view

of the above no Federal violations under the Bureau's

jurisdiction have developed.

3. A confidential source very close to the subject, who has

known him all his life, was formerly the accountant for

the TRAFFICANTE family.

swore to him he had never been engaged in illegal activities

except gambling. In view of such,

and in view of the

information set out above that subject has more or less

any gambling ventures for income tax returns, wagering tax

stamp and possible violations of general Internal Revenue
