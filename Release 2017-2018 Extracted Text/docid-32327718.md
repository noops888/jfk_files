MM 105-2856

MM 3142-PSI has known for many years.

CASANUEVA explained

that he felt that his house might be searched by the FBI

and he requested MM 3142-PSI who is employed in the con-

struction industry, to hold

these detonators for him until

BOSCH needed them.

These detonators were turned over by

SA DAVIS to MI. TOM BRODY, bomb expert, Crime Laboratory,

Dade County Public Safety Department, on 4/9/73, with the

request that they be deactivated and

marked with secret

identification so that BRODY can later testify concerning

them if necessary. BRODY agreed to do so and on 4/11/73,

returned them to SA DAVIS, stating that each had been de-

activated so that no explosion could occur by anyone using

BRODY made photographs of each. On 4/12/73, Special

Employee JOHN BIRMINGHAM, in the presence of SA DAVIS, made

color photographs of these detonators.

SA DAVIS also marked

each secretly. for possible subsequent identification.

the same date, 4/12/73, they were returned to MM 3142-PSI

who agreed to

immediately notify this office in the event

CASANUEVA requests the detonators be returned to him. MM

• 3142-PSI agreed to delay the return of the detonators a

sufficient length of time to enable Agents to discreetly

surveil the pick up and destination of CASANUEVA. (S) U)

There appears to be little doubt but that BOSCH,

who is

probably the most notorious bomber in the State of

Florida, is

planning to become again active in the field

of bombings.

It also appears very unlikely that his targets

will be in Europe since his principal hate is the Federal

Government of the United states (S)

*И)

All Miami informants have

een instructed to

• attempt to obtain further details concerning his plans

and operations.

SA DAVIS has warned RICARDO MORALES NAVARETTE

concerning the alleged threats made against him by BOSCH

and has also advised Officer RALPH AGUIRRE of the Miami

Police Department concerning the possibility of an attempt

being made against the life of MORALES.

MORALES has

expressed

confidence in his ability to take care of hingele C2)
