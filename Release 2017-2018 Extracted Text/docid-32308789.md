bookmaking on a limited basis in Miomi Beach during past

years.

HARRIS LEVINSON died in May, 1951.

This Syndicate

which

formerly had its headquarters

at 1131 5th Street,

Miami Beach, is now dissolved. It last operated on

small

basis during the 1950-1951 Winter seadon from their head-

quarters in the Blue Horizon Hotel, Surfside, Florida,

No

information indicative of activity on the part of CLARK or .

NOLAN in the recent hast has been obtained.

THE MANNERINO GANG

One of the better known Italian gangs in the Last

. Pennsylvania.

MANNER INO

MILLIA-SAMS, FBI #1743374, and

and rackets in the New Kensington, Pennsylvania, area for

the past fifteen years.

According to information furnished

*by the Pittsburgh Office by letter dated May 7, 1951, the

gang's operations included pinball and slot machines, horses

and the numbers racket.

The MANNERINO gang came to the attention of the

Miami Office during the 1950-1951 Winter Season when

confidentail Informant MF-334 (DAV& SHIFHON)

3AME MANVER INO had an interest in gambling at thessans Sousl

Hotel near

Havana, Cuba.

No known illegal activity on the

part of the men.bers of

the MANNihiNo Gang in the Miami area

was leanred.

However, MF-334 stated that the MANNERINOS

formerly operated the cocktail lounge in the Albion Hotel,

Miami. Beach, which was a notorious hoodlum hangout. This

was apparently fronted for this combination by one

NORMIE ROTHMAN. Unsubstantiated rumor in underworld circles

was to the effect that the MANNERINOs sold their interest

to one JIMiY GARDEN, an Italian racketeer from the Pittsburgh,-

Pennsylvania, area.

In conversation with the writer, CARDEN

claimed he was the owner of the Albion Cocktail Lounge, and

while admitting that the MANNERINOs had been formerly associ-

HAVE INOS had

ated with it, claimed they were no longer active and had no

financial interest in this establishment.

IRVING "Niggy"

ROTHMAN has claimed to the

writer that he has a financial interest in gambling at the

san souch motel, havana, Cuba, and is known to have travelled

Irequently between Miami Beach

and Havana, Cuba, during the

past winter season.

However, unsubstantiated rumor in

gamlbing circles is tha ROTHMAN is merely a front man and

employee of the MANNERINOs.

No further information concern-

ing interest of members of the MANNERINO Gang in the area is

known.

gambling in south Florida is at least a $50, 000, 000.00

a year business and that the established racketeers are

not

going to give it up even though some of their underlings

may have to go to the penitentiary. Most everyone agrees

that the day of the plush gambling casino is over though

all expect that there will be floating crap games and a num-

ber of roulette wheels, etc., operating on a sneak basis.

ARTHUR NEWMAN, a gambler originally from New York

City, who has been associated with "Lefty" CLARK and other

nationally prominent gamblers in the past, recently advised

that he and his partners have opened three cigar stores in

which they hoped to operate handbooks if given an "OK."
