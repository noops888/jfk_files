DETAILS:

C. ASSOCIATES

On December 6, 1972, PG I-1 advised:

With regard to the story that some guy named

on December 5, 1972, informant asked KELLY MANNARINO what

his feelings were about the situation.

MANNARINO said the guy who was supposed to be

the victim is SID

SCORATOW. He said he considered SID

SCORATOW to be a "creep," and he could not care less what

happened. He said that

his brother, MARCO SCORATOW,

was a friend of his, and if the contract had been put out

a 1s

on MARCO, he would have ordered that somebody take MARIO's

money and then reverse the contract on him.

However, he said

under the current situation he did not care which way the

thing was handled, so long as it did not bring any heat or

nim or his town, New Kensington, Pa.

On December 10, 1972, PG T-1 advised:

EDDIE KLEIN told him that he knew that the young guy,

TONY MURGlE, had set him up for the recent armed robbery at

KLEIN's residence in Pittsburgh. KLEIN admitted that the

figures concerning the cash and

jewelry were inflated, but

claimed he did not give out the figures that high.

He says

he is now worried that the Internal Revenue Service will cause

him trouble.

He had no insurance on the stolen property.

KLEIN said he was worried as he wondered if "the

TONY MURGIE,

Ohio, area.

He pointed out that most of the

which had been taken was given to him for disposal by PAUl

HANKISH of Wheeling, W. Va., and he felt HANkISh mignt be

angered.

HANKISH, when told of the situation, agreed that they

would have to go through "mob" connections to get the stuff
