ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES

We would like to take time out in our Investigation of the Fresident's

assassination to appraise the role of the Mexico City Station in the whole affair.

Since the early afternoon of 22 November 1963, Mexico City has been the only

maJor overseas reporter in the case.

While this 1s partly dictated by the

facts of Lee OSWALD's life, we have not overlooked the really outstanding per-

formance of Mexico City's major assets and the speed, precision, and perception

With which the data was forwarded. Here it was relayed within minutes to the

White House, ODACID, and ODENYY.

2. Your LIENYOY data,

the statements of Silvia DURAN, and your analyses

were major factors In the quick clarification of the case, blanking out the really

ominous spectre of foreign backing:

return, but we have not been given much yet.

he had ever been to Mexico except for & jump to Tle Juana. We have quickly

screened the FBI report on the whole case but we do not yet have a copy for

retention. It does not compromise your sources. Basically, what the New York

Times has printed about the report 1s all true.

3.

We have meanwhile been flooded with fabrications, of which the ALYARADO

story was the most troublesone. They are still coming in.

You have had good support fron your liaison, but as usual the really

outstanding features were Mexico Station's famous generalship and the skill and

devotion of 1ts personnel. Please convey our admiration to all who participated,

down to the last technician, translator, and monitor. We know that the work

your Station did during the President's 1962 visit made you feel this tragedy

with particular keenness, as did we.
