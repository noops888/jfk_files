Dear ME. BIseOn!

I have seen the correspondence exchanged between

A draft for the sun in

I do not know in the name of whom or what Mios Snedley

spoake of the China Forum.

Since she was not in China at

the time the Forun Suspended, not has she corresponded

with me on the subjeot, I consider i necessary to place

before you and the other contributors an account of the

carcumstances in which the Forun consed publication.

Binoe you apparently gathered the contributors together

In a meeting to bear what Mias Bedley had to say, I

would appreciate it deeply 18 you would gather then once

-nore to hear my nocount.

It has been publisbed in China In a Chinese translation

but has not been pub

to the Forum

to which you have been put in thie matter. I do hope,

however, that my letter will enlighten you and your

and enable you to apprectate the diffioulties

which have arisen.

I know of'no projeot to revive the

Should such occur

the

I think people

LOLALOT HI R. LEIAGE 10 TAR C.C.P. SONORITE

1OR84e ChIRA F9F4

To the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party:

The two year period of my extra-organizational 00l

laboration with the Chinese Commniat Party bas come to

an end and the China Forun which I founded and edited dum

ing that time hes been forced to suspend publication. In

the interest of our whole movement as well as in my per-

sonal interest, I coneider it necessary to record here

and publiah the hletory of the Obina Forum and the olr

cumstances of ite suspenedon.

You refuded me the oppoi

tunity to lay the matter before the memberablp of the

party even when I offered to do so in your own organs and

not through

the columns of the forum.

Khen, wrongly, I

permitted

the forum

to go down in allence, you turned

around and in your organs and near organs

in China and

abroad you proceeded fish the usual slanders of "betrayer"

and "counter- revolutionary".

In so doing you didn't have

the courare or the

flaple honesty to state that you pre

sented the China Forun with an ultlmatim and forded 188

suspendion because in reply its editor raised questione

which are being placed before the whole movement today

by the International

Left Opposition.

Nor did you state

that you deliverately smashed the forum for this reason

despite my repeated

and extended offers to continue publi

cation as before on a agraight anti- Kuomintang,

Here, as in the

broader lisues which led to our differences, your blind

adherence to false policles was once more demonatrative

of your readiness to place your factional intereeta above

she interesta of the Chinese Revolution.

In golng baok over the history of the Forum, I think

the violous cbaracter of your aotion becomes even more

evident when I start wish the fact that from beginning to

end I functioned not as a member of the party but as a

wiliing sympatbiser who was prepared to throw all hla

energlés into a job he sar he could do - edit and publiah

I ask you to recall the whole perfor of the organisas

and aotivities of the China-Longue for 01vil Righta,

from December,

in which I took an

notive pert.

I gave full blay to thia nybrid league an

Its work without once publishing the vasio oritiolen

which I often voiced to you and which in the end were

wholly confirmed by what hainened after the Kuomintang

murdered Yang Chlen in June that year.

I ask you to recall the views 1 set forth in August

and Sentember, 1933, on the subjeot of the "anti-lar Con-

gress which at your speolfio request & did not publieh.

Instead, to my regret, I vublished the foul rot of lar

ley & Co., lthout Iroely giving play to the true faote

about that farolonl junket which had convinoed me that

the pollates which give it birth do not. one

I was not to

deal with

the lesues which had brought Chen Tu halu from

being the leader of the C.P. in 1937 to being leader of

she Chinese Oposition in 1933.

I was only

to string to

gother a vile serien of labela in an effort to ezplain

why the Kuomintang even Imprisoned the leader of the

Left Opposition.

Ae you know, that attack was never

written or published.

Again in December, 1933, upon my return from

you

specifioally denanded that I net aaide the resultien

my own personal investigations in Foochow In order to

write on your behalf (but over my aignature!) an utterly

baseless

and alanderous attack on the Left Opnosition.

You will recall that you oharged at that time that the

"Trotskyists" were prominently identified with the neu

governient set us in Jükien by Chen Hing-shu and Taal'

Ting-tel.

You lumped the Left Opposition with

Party and the 80-called Sooial Democrats among the petty

bourgeois satellites of the Fuklen militariets.

so much to satlery myself on this very point as to per

form a mission for you that I went down to Fooohon and

spent two weeks there and learned through diroot contaot

with dosens of people prominently concerned that the Left

Opposition were stoutly and olenrly onsosed to the foochow

regime.

I haven't place bare to diecues

the relatione of

the c.P. to the short lived Fuklen Government or the char

noter of the "negotlattons" which were going on down there...

Yet I somehow did so and sought in whatever way possible

You deganded more.

You demanded

revolutionary way:

You demonded that the China foru

to.

In reply to my questions on China you simply quoted

back to me the lies and half-llen I've been so used to

reading in Inpregory.

You even declared:

"For propa.

ganda burposes a certain amount of exaggeration 1a neces

oary..." and went on amasingly to say:

"but we know the

true. lacts and we base our polioles on them

not on these

Anericans and India's intouchables.

Subject plans to publish is August

I9'7 a book on the Anerican Jews In Icrael and is working on anotber on

the Philippines.

WUSPARRON/1 first not Subject in Igl6 alter he had just completed

a long and friendly Intervier with lo Chi Minh as Far Bast correspondent

5. Subject first went to the Par East about 1930 when be was a crew

after a flare up with Holliagton TONG, part-oner of the paper...

then joined the Nerveek foreign staff. Subject was in and out of

Bungkok after Woald war II and HUSPAriONl becane friendly with hir.

According to WUSPAHRON/1, many people regard Subject's Tragedy of 3be

Chinese Revolution as a significant sork and a recent writer in china,

Dennis BLOODORTH, holds a good vier of Subject's Scratchen on the Mind.

subjost now-seens permanently settled with MIT, having bought

Subject hosts there at pool-side

"seminars" on Saturday afternoons, with MIT faculty friends and jourallat

friends such as Bob SHAPLEN coming by. Subject Imvited WUSPARRON/1 to

participate as vell.

8. Hovever, as SUSPARROW/l ascertained, Subject has little contact

with foreign students save for an occasional adult foreign graduate

• student. We bope, considering Subjact's background, that he will grove

From: John I. Coddington

• Subject: HAROLD ROBERT ISAACS

Mr. GORGE N. KATES of 033, Fleh, has just retured to the United Stateo

from Chungking. He reached lashington yesterday. He claims to have known

HAROLD ROBERT ISAACS quite woll in Chungking, and has the following observations

to make concerning Mir. ISAACS:

HAROLD ROBERT ISAACS 18 about 35 jeara of age. Ho attended Columbia

University, and received the dezros of A.B. there in 1930. He 1s tho son of

an orthodox jowish norchant, who is very wealthy, and who has almaye supported

HAROLD, even though he did not approve of the radical views that HAROLD expressed

In the 19309g.

HAROLD went to China imadiatoly after graduation from Columbla, partly,

atleast, out of a desire to see strange parts of the world and to experienco

"adventure." He went out by way of Herall, and stowed away for part of the

voyage - elther between San Franciaco and Honolulu, or between Honolulu and

Shangha1 - Mr. KATES does not resenber which. Anyway, this was part of the

"adventure." -

In China, HAROLD not a South African named PRANK CLASS, who was an "Intolloctual"

and a very interesting person. C1A33 mas a Leftlat, but not at all a Communist.

HAROLD took a trip up the Yangtse with GLASS in 1930 or 1931. At about this timo,

HAROLD became a convert to protokylan, partly, at least, under GlASSis Influenco.

He felt that "suffering humanity" required a "revolution" to set things stráight.

Corzunism was too organized, and FOLD was a complete individualist, and renctod

strongly against the organizationei set-up of Communist, and ao espoused Trotskylan.

He raturned to Shanghal from the western part of China, and went to work for

This hiYAs lens Agency: shortly aüer this, in Shagghal, he carried VIOLA ROBINSON,

who.w9s, like HhACLD, a widowed i-iailectual. This aarriago probably took place

In 1932. VIOLA was a great friend di AGES StADIEY, the author of the Esttle Hymn

of China and of other books dealing with the Chinese Reroiution.

in organisation called the Gina league for üivil Rights was formed about

1932. YANG CH' IN was the head of this for Central Chins, and Dr. HU SHIN (later

Chirese imbassador to rashington) was the head of it for North China. YANG was at

that tino Secretary-General of the deademia Sinica. YaNt was soon assassinated

by the Blue Shirts (at that time GIUG KNI-SEK's bodyguard). HAROLD ISHACS had

been an enthusiastic nember of the wins League for Civil Rights, and in the

atrosphere of turmoil, niter the killing of YANG, shen all leftists were under

attack by the Kuonintans, HAPOLD becasa the editor and publisher of the China Forun,

a magasine that published a number of controversial articles. The magazine was

protected by the fact that the editor was an American, and therufore had extra-

torritorial rights. Yet the magazine was regarded as a "thorn in the flesh" by tr.

CUNNIH, who was at that time durican Consul-General in Shanghal. There were

various controversies - the printing shop as broken up by kuanintans strong-arm

men; the mils were refused to the ragazine; but he continued publication for

some

tine, and smuggled the coples out to the subseribers.

In 1933 or 1934, ISLACS bad & fight with AGNES SIALSY. It was an ideological

right, and therefore especially bitter. IslAGS and his wife left Slanghas aster

this, and soved to Paking. There he acquired a Chinose translator named LIU,, and

thero he settled down to wrlte his back, The Tragddy of the Chinese Fevolution.

This book "nails the Stalinists to the maste and shows that they were messing.

around with a situation in China which they did not understand. Very many people

who have read the book consider it erellent.

## Page 116

HAROLD ROPEST ISLICS, contlined

The book was completed, and ISAACS and his wife roturned to the United States

about Aprill or say 1935. Inmediately after this, ISAACS made a rapid trip to

Oslo, Norway, to see his hero, LioN TOTSKY, who was living there at that time.

It was on this occasion that ho mist have undertaken to translate TROTSKY'a book,

Whither France? ISIACS than returned to New York, and went to work for the

HAVAS News Agency once more.

At some timo in the lato 1930's, he became interedted in New York pollties,

and he worked hard for NORWAY THOMAS.

By 1940, however; ho became disgusted with New York politics, and became

interested in the war, and In'bourgeois life." He and his wife had a baby at

about this time (their firat), and ISAACS found he could write radio scripts and

ket good money for them. Up to 1940, he had been living chiefly off his father,

but from 1940 on, ho begar to mike money. In 1942, he did a "Report to the Nation"

for CBS.

Soon after this, he joined the Staff of News-lieck, and in 19k was sent to chungking

by that magazine. There must have been a certain amount of trouble in convincing

the Chirese Central Goverriment that ISLACS had really changed since the old days

1n Shanghal; but this convication was evidently accomplished, or ISAACS would not

have received permission from the Chirinse Covernment to go to China.

IShACS 10a very amart ran indeed. He knows a lot: about China, and he knows a

lot about people in general. loreover, he is a great deal snoother and more

diplamtle now than he was ten years ago.

HAROLD ROBERT ISANGS 10 no the correspondent of Nowswook magesine In

China. His beadquartere

meiyang, and other places in the course of hia dutlos. He seems to have arrived

in China In his present capacity during the sumer of 194l, probably in July.

Subjecò was born In 1910, and 1s a member of a realthy family. He became

a firmly convinced Trotskyist in his youth, and ramined one till the time of

PearlHarbor. He is now regarded as a renegade by his former Trotskyist callengues,

because he has disavowed the principles of world revolution, tured away from

Trotsky's teschings, and since 1939 has been writing patriotic propaganda for the

United States Government.

He merit to China about 1930, and wrote two books dealing with Chinese

politics, Pire Years of Kuomintans Reaction (1932), and Ihe Iragedy of the Chinese

Revolution (1938). Both of these volumes axpressed the author'a trotskylat

point of view. The first was publlahed in Shanghat, and the second in London:

Neither was ever published in the United States, and ISAACS sald that the

Stalinist Communist, were so powerful in this country that they mere able to

provent the pablication of the Tragedy of the Chinose Revolution here. This

book received high praise from many serious students of Far Eastern affairs,

Including G.P. Fudson, Pollow of All Souls College at Oxford, and author of

The Far East in Forld Politica, who said that ISAACS' book was the test one ever

mrltten on the Chinese Revolution. Hudson is now an official of the British

Ministry of Information.

was always open and above-board, and never ongaged in any conspiracies to overthrow

established government. He was attracted to the movement, they say, by sheer

For a time in China, ISAACS lived with Tillman DURDIN, the China correspondent

of the New York Ilmes, who was then the managing editor of the China Pross. ISAACS

In contimation of a merlous report on the subject of the New York "Nation", I hat

to state that further efforts to purchase this piblication have proved successrul;

and I attach hermith three copies, respectively dated July 6, Aug. 10 and Aug 24, 1932.

From a cusory perusual of these editions, the "Nation"s political polley appears

to bd a socialistic nature, openly professing oppositon to the Republican and Democratic

loctrines persiling throughout the United stow States, and advocating support for the

acialist Party's irid candidate Norman Thomas at the forth coming Presidotia

Further articles appearirg in these editions are nothing more nor less that sourilous

attacks on the fepublican President of The USA.-Hertert' Hoover.

Harold i Tsaacs nailing list has been carefully persudd, but no mention is made

of the nation" or any of the Poople connected with it.
