following

representatives of captioned Committee: Chief Counsel F.A.O.

Schwartz; Assistant Counsel Paul Michel; Staff Member Mark

Gitenstein; Staff Director of the Domestic Task Force John I.

Elliff; and Staff Member John Bayley•

Representing the Bureau

at this meeting were Deputy. Associate Director James. B. Adams,

Assistant Director John A. Mintz, Inspector John B. Hotis, and

SA Paul V. Daly.

The meeting discussed the forthcoming testimony on

12/9/75 of the Director before that Committee and Elliff

fur-1

nished the Bureau two draft papers discussing the Bureau's

investigative jurisdiction and issues the Committee Staff feels

the Senate. Select Committee must address from a legislative

standpoint. Copies of these papers are attached.

The first paper which consists of six pages discusses

in Part 1 what the Committee sees as problems arising out of

the FBI's domestic intelligence investigations. This portion

highlights the fact that these investigations may be overbroad

in scope, collect irrelevant information, and continue the in-

vestigations beyond what the Committee sees as their normal

investigative conclusion.

This portion also addresses the

investigative techniques used during these investigations and

the resultant dissemination of information collected.

Under Part 2, the document discusses options available

to the Committee.

These options run the gamut from abolition

of the Bureau's domestic intelligence functions to administrative

oversight by the Attorney General or Congressional oversight or

enacting legislation providing for domestic intelligence investi-

gations with legislative limits imposed on such investigations.

Included is the consideration of creating

Inspector General.

RE:

SENSTUDY, 75

The second position paper which was prepared by

John T. Elliff begins by a six-page statement and analysis

of the Bureau's current authority to conduct domestic in-

telligence investigations. He then lists four options for

the Committee.

Option 1 is for Congress: to pass legislation ratifying

the existing FBI authority as set forth by Presidential directives

and Executive Orders.

Option 2 suggests. Congress might give serious con-

sideration to creating a separate. Security Intelligence Agency

within the Department of Justice.

In this Option, Elliff sug-

gests: that the FBI itself has considered this Option as part of

the larger question of separating all FBI intelligence functions

from law enforcement functions of the Bureau.

Option 3 considers the elimination of FBI domestic

intelligence. In his analysis of this position, it might be

possible for

• the Bureau to develop the necessary intelligence

information through its normal criminal investigations and

thus remove the necessity for domestic intelligence investi-

gations as presently conducted.

Option: 4 considers. setting standards for domestic

intelligence investigations.

In this. Option, Elliff states

that the FBI should be authorized by statute

to conduct domestic

intelligence investigations only as Congress finds that regular

criminal investigations would not provide information to an-

ticipate or prevent the use of violence in violations of Federal

law and that incidents of the use of violence in such violations

are

of a serious nature and threaten the

security of the country.

For purposes of the Director's appearance on 12/9/75

before the Senate Select Committee, it is believed his response

to questions concerning the aforementioned position papers should

be that the Bureau has received copies and is reviewing. the various

proposals and that it would not be appropriate at this time for

Ithe Director to. comment regarding the substance of the proposals.

Elliff indicated during this meeting that the Director

during his appearance may anticipate being asked a question by

one of the Senators relating to his statement before the American

Bar Association in Montreal concerning the necessity for the

sacrifice of certain individual rights at the expense of investi-

gations. He also anticipated the Director might be asked a

question concerning his position on COINTELPRO.

Regarding

the question concerning the Director's statement before the

American Bar Association in Montreal, the Legal Counsel Divi-

sion will draft a proposed resonse.

Concerning COINTELPRO, a

response has been prepared and will be put together with the

briefing material for the Director.

This memorandum in general highlights the Options

presented in the attached papers.

A more detailed analysis

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

HEREIN IS UNGLASSIFIED

DATE /0/31/00 BY SP2ALMK8

I. Background

In the past few weeks the staff has presented the Committee

with evidence suggesting the following about the FBI's

internal security intelligence program:

A.

The program is massive, involving the collection of

information on the activities of thousands of innocent,

law-abiding American citizens.

B. These individuals were not alleged espionage agents, but

citizens who fall within the FBI's vague definitions of

"subversion" and "extremism" -- purely homegrown "threats

to the national security".

C. That FBI policy on "subversive" and "extremist" inves-

tigations was vague and subject to the following abuses:

1. overbreadth in scope in that groups were investigated

whose threats to the national security were tenuous,

it not non-existent.

2. collection of information on the personal life and

political views of subjects unrelated to the national

security.

3.

the continuance of investigations well after it

should have become obvious that there was no legiti-

mate predicate.

D. Particularly invasive collection technigues were used,

including electronic surveillance, mail opening, and

Sur-

reptitious entries. Although these have been terminated,

the predominant and perhaps most insidious continues

today through the FBI's huge informant/confidential source

network.

E. Information collected in the course of these investiga-

tions is disseminated

regularly throughout the federal

government and to local law enforcement.

F.

Until 1971, information collected through these investi-

gations was disseminated as part of the COINTELPRO PIO-

gram to the subjects' friends, relatives, employers, and

others in an effort to aiscredit or "neutralize" alleged

"subversives" Or "extremists"

G.

The FBI's internal security intelligence program was

used by Presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to Richard

Nixon to serve their political interests, usually by

collecting information on

a critics or political

opponents.

н.

I:

The program was conceived and implemented in secrecy,

and although parts of the program were shared with out-

side authorities from time to time, until now no

President, Attorney General, or Congressional committee

has been exposed to the entire program in detail.

The program is not authorized by statute but is founded

on a series of secret or ambiguous Presidential orders,

which in turn are based upon a questionable assertion

of "inherent constitutional authority".

.J.

The program continues today, albeit on a much more

limited basis than in the late 1960's and early 1970's,

and the basic machinery for the program -- the huge

informant/confidential source network - is still

operating::

K.

There is no statute or internal Bureau or Justice Depart-

ment policy prohibiting a new Director, Attorney General,

or President from ordering the Bureau to expand the pro-

gram to its earlier dimensions.

II.

Issues and Options

Among the issues and options which might be discussed with

tormer Attorneys General in response to what the committee

has learned are the following:

A.

Abolition. Elimination of the FBI internal security

intelligence program as Attorney General Harlan Stone

ordered in 1924 when confronted with abuses growing out

of the FBI's first internal security intelligence pro-

gran, such

as the infamous

Palmer raids.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider

the following issues:

1.

Whether there are not some functions le.g., protecting

the President, preventing or at least preäicting

violence by terrorist organizations, or predicting

civil disorders) which require intelligence collec

tion.

HH 55013 DocId 32989602 Page 6

---

## Page 7

3

B.

2.

Whether FBI intelligence reports are valuable in

that respect, especially in light of a recent GAO

report suggesting that such reports are rarely use-

ful in predicting violent activity.

3. Whether such information, assuming it is valuable,

could not be obtained through more traditional criminal

investigations.

4.

Whether the value of the information; marginäl of

otherwise, justifies the risk to civil liberties

inherent in such intelligence collection.

5. Whether, given the way in which limited and ambiguous

grants of authority have been expanded into major

authorizations,.any statute short of a total prohibi-

tion of all non-law enforcement intelligence activi

ties in the domestic sector will be adequate to pre-

vent the recurrences of the kinds of abuses uncovered

•by this Committee.

(Ox, conversely, whether it is

possible to draft a law

authorizing a limited civil

: disturbance and counter-terrorist intelligence mission

that will not eventually evolve, like the National

Security Act of 1947, into a charter for unanticipated

and unwanted covert activities.)

6. Whether it would be sufficient to restrict the FBI

to criminal investigations

without also

(a) placing

limits upon the length of investigations, (bi the

kinäs of information which can be collected and dis-

seminated on the subject irrelevant to the alleged

criminal act, (c). the utilization of warrantless

electronic surveillance and other particularly inva-

sive collection techniques, and (d) the utilization

of a huge informant/confidential source network with-

out judicial or Justice Department supervision.

Authorizing Statute. Recognition of the value of

internal security intelligence, but placing limits upon

the program designed to minimize the infringement upon

civil liberties, an option being actively considered by

the present Attorney General.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider

many of the issues

set out under the first option and,

in addition:

- HH 55013 DocId:32989602 Page 7

---

## Page 8

-4 -

C.

1.

Whether meaningful and stringent guidelines can be

written which do not so hamper the administration

of an internal security intelligence program as to

make the product not just marginal, as GÃo suggests,.

but worthless.*

2. In light of the possibility that the present Attorney

General may address this matter via internal Justice

Department guidelines, whether this approach does

not ignore the legal authority question which can.

only be resolved by statute.

3.

Whether or not Congress could draft a statutory ver-

To not anot

sion of the guidelines which could be flexible enough

to meet an evolving threat and at the same time

place meaningful restrictions upon the program.

4 .

Even assuming there is no absence of legal authority,

is it safe to leave these guidelines

in the form of

a

departmental order which can be rescinded by the next

Attorney General?

Delegation of Authority to Attorney General. Simply

ratifying the present program via enactment of a statutory

charter which grants the FBI authority to conduct

• an

internal security intelligence program

subject to its own

internal guidelines or departmental guidelines as proposea

by the Attorney General.

In weighing this option, the Conmittee should consider

many of the issues set out above and:

• 1...

Whether such a statute would not be an unconstitu-

tional delegation of powers to the Executive Branch.

2.

Whether enactment of such a statute would nos repree.

sent a

failure by the Congress to confront the issues

raised above.

*A preliminary staff analysis of the Attorney General's draft

guidelines suggests that, despite months of conscientious and

painstaking work by a departmental task force, the guidelines

are not adequate.

This analysis, which will be presented when

Attorney General Levi testifies on December 10, indicates that

several of the more questionable FBI investigations

(e.g., of

DI. King and the women's liberation movement) would still be

permissible under these proposed guidelines.

D. Legislative Inaction.

Enact no new statute affecting

the FBI's legal authority or the internal security intel-

ligence program.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider

many of the issues set out above and, in addition:

1.

Whether this failure to act might not leave the

status of the program in doubt and subject to court

challenge.

2.

Whether this failure to act after full disclosure

by the Bureau might not be

taken by the FBI and the

courts as a ratification of the program.

E.

Administrative Oversight by the Attorney General. The

Justice Department should be required

to exercise greater

administrative oversight over the FBI's internal security

intelligence program by Attorney General Levi, regardless

of whatever other options Congress accepts.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider

the following issues:

1.

Whether it is practical for the Attorney General or

his staff to review thousands of such investigations

each year.

2.

Whether the Attorney General or his staff should

review all or just the so-called "full" investiga-

tions.

Whether it is possible to develop a staff of career

attorneys within the Department with both the access.

and independence essential to the conduct of search-

ing reviews.

Whether the Attorney General or his staff should not

also be

required to review various informant and so-

called

' "intensification" programs, and the establish-

ment of specialized indices (which have a significant

impact upon which cases are opened) instead of just

reviewing individual investigations in a vacuum

F. An. Inspector General. . In addition to the above options,

an independent Inspector General should be created to

investigate improprieties by the FBI.

This option is

advanced by those concerned about the inadequacy of the

FBI's investigation of the disappearance of former

Director Hoover's personal files, its limited inquiry

into the so-called Atlantic City convention case, and

the absence of any internal investigation of the abuses

in the King case.

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider

the following issues:

I. Whether it is possible to maintain the independence

of an Inspector General within the Department of

Justice when both the Inspector General and the

Director of the FBI will be responsible to the same

official, the Attorney General.

2.

Whether the Inspector General should have "complete"

access to Bureau files, including information per-

taining to the identity and reliability of informants

and confidential sources.

• 3.

Whether an Inspector General with access to extremely

sensitive information might not become a

serious

threat to the independence of the Bureau from politi-

cal influence and to the civil liberties of American

citizens.

G. Congressional Oversight. In addition to the above

options, the creation of an oversight committee (s) in the

Congress; to which the Bureau would be required to report

and which would have the power to investigate abuses.

In weighing this option, the Committee

should consider

the kinds of problems posed by the Justice Department

oversight and Inspector General options discussed above

to the independence of the FBI and the confidentiality

of its files.

н.

Public Reporting and Disclosure to Subjects.

In addition

to the above options, the requirement that the FBI make

frequent public reports on the details of its internal.

security intelligence programs

the details of improper intelligence investigations to

the subjects of those investigations.

HH 55013 DocId:72989602 Page 10

In weighing this option, the Committee should consider

the following issues:

I. Whether it is possible to reveal the essence of some

programs and policies and

the details of some inves-

cigations without jeopardizing the effectiveness of

legitimate programs.

2. Whether such disclosure might not increase the num-

ber of law suits filed against the FBI alleging

• illegal activities.

MEMOPANDUM

December 4, 1975.

'FBI LEGISLATION - PROPOSED OPTIONS

In preparation for the testimony. of FBI Director

Kelley and Attorney General Levi on Decemöer 9 and 10, the

Domestic Intelligence Task Force is pulling together various

proposals pr legislation dealing with FBI intelligence.

This paper sets forth some of the basic options.

A:

Current Statutes and Executive Orders

The basic statute governing the FBI is 18 U.S.C. 533,

which

reads

as follows:

The Attorney General may appoint officials:

• (1) to detect and prosecute crimes against

the United States, (2) to assist in the

protection of the person of the President,

and (3) to conduct such other investigations

regarding official matters under the control

of the Department of Justice and the Depart-

ment of State as may be directed by the

Attorney General.

Clauses (2) and (3) are a possible statutory basis

for intelligence investigations going beyond the investigation

of specific federal crimes. Under (2), the FBI may "assist" the

Secret Service in the protection of the President by providing

intelligence on persons or groups who may endanger the Presi-

dent's safety.: A formal agreement between the FBI and the

Secret Service sets forth the, types of intelligence information

provided by the Bureau. However, this agreement states that:

The FBI will not conduct investigation

of individuals or groups solely for the pur-

pose of establishing whether they constitute

a threat to the safety of the President and

certain other persons unless there is an

indication of a violation of Title 18, U.S.

code, Section 1751, or other statute over

which the FBI has

jurisdiction.

(Tab A)

'Clause (3)

recognizes that the Attorney General may

direct the FBI to conduct investigations, other than criminal

investigations, regarding certain undefined "official matters

under the control of the Department of Justice." This is a

possible statutory basis for at least two broad areas of FBI

intelligence investigations - civil disturbance intelligence

and intelligence for the Federal Employee Security Program.

The most recent legal advice to the FBI from the Justice

Department on the gathering and reporting of data regarding

civil disturbances notes that on April 1, 1969, the President

designated the Attorney General as chief civilian officer to

coordinate the government's response to civil disturbances.

The FBI is instructed to gather and report on "all significant

incidents of civil unrest" and on "all disturbances where there

are indications that extremist organizations . . . are believed

to be invoived in efforts to instigate or exploit them." The

HH

55013 DocId/32989602 Page 13

## Page 14

• ou

3

FBI is specifically advised to make reports "even when no

specific violation of federal law is indicated." On the other

hand, the FBI is instructed not to report "every relatively in-

significant incident of a strictly local nature coming to its

attention." (Tab B)

The Justice Department has given the following recent

instructions to the FBI regarding intelligence for the federal

Employee Security Program. Executive Order 10450, as amended

• by Executive Order 11785, is interpreted as requiring an FBI

investigation of organizations "with a potential" of violating

federal or state statutes prohibiting unlawful advocacy of vio-

lence or the commission of any unlawful act of violence. The

FBI is advised that "it is not possible to set definite para-

meters covering the initiation of investigations of potential

organizations falling within the Order." The FBI is instructed

to apply "the same yardstick" to investigations of individuals

who are affiliated with such organizations. The FBI is specifi-

cally advised that "it is not necessary that a crime occur

before the investigation is initiated." (Tab C)

Clause (3) also recognizes that the Attorney General

may direct the FBI to conduct investigations, other than criminal

investigations, regarding certain undefined "official matters

under the control of the Department of State." This

is a pos-

sible statutory basis for FBI intelligence investigation of

• foreign intelligence activities within the United States or to

HH 55013 DocId:Q2989602 Page 14

---

## Page 15

- 4

collect positive foreign intelligence. The best example is

the Attorney General's authorization of

warrantless FBI elec-

tronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes.

However,

there is apparently no instruction from the Justice Department

to the FBI directing the Bureau to initiate investigations of

individuals or organizations which have a marked potential for

use by a foreign intelligence service, but about which there is

no information indicating intelligence activity. (See Staff

Report, "Counterintelligence/Counterespionage: The Law and

the Philosophy", October 14, 1975.)

•. In his testimony before the Committee, Deputy Associate

FBI Director

JEK Act 6 (4)

made no reference to clauses (2) and

(3) as a possible legal basis for FBI intelligence investiga-

tions going beyond the investigation of specific federal crimes.

Instead, he placed sole reliance on a series of Presidential

directives extending from 1936 until the 1960's which the FBI

interprets as authorizing it to engage in "domestic security

intelligence investigations". The Attorney General has codified

these directives in a Justice Department regulation instructing

the FBI to:

Carry out the Presidential directive

of September 6, 1939, as reaffirmed by Presi-

dential directives of January 8, 1943, July

24, 1950, and December 15, 1953, designating

the [FBI]

to take charge of investigative

work in matters relating to espionage, sabotage,

subversive activities,

and related matters.

28 C.F.R., Section 0.85 (d) .

NW 55013 DocIa532989602 Page 15

## Page 16

The FBI also cites directives.of President Kennedy on June 9,

1962, and Attorney General Kennedy on March 5, 1964, which

are the latest charter for the Interdepartmental.

• Intelligence

conference, composed of the FBI Director and the chiefs of the

military intelligence agencies. This group is authorized to

coordinate "all investigation of domestic espionage, counter-

espionage, sabotage, subversion, and other related intelligence

matters affeching internal security." (Tab d)

The theory behind the FBI's position is that the Prési-

dent. has inherent constitutional: powers, at least in the

absence of contrary legislation, to authorize FBI intelligence

activities.. The only judicial support for this theory is

language in the Supreme Court's opinion in the Keith case,

which declared warrantless wiretapping of domestic groups un-

constitutional.

The Court acknowledged the importance of "national secu-

rity in its domestic implications.... especially at a time

of worldwide ferment and when civil disorders in this country

are more prevalent than in the less turbulent periods of our

history." Under such circumstances, the

court stated, the

President has a "fundamental duty" under the Constitution to

"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United

States." The Court added, "Implicit in

that duty is the power

to protect our Government against those who would subvert or

overthrow it by unlawful means." Hence, the Court appeared to

KH 55013 DocIdj32989602 Paye 16

---

## Page 17

-.6

recognize that the President's "domestic security role" has a

"constitutional basis"; that the President through the Attorney

General may need "to obtain intelligence information about those

who plot unlawful acts against the Government"; and that "threats

and acts of sabotage against the Government exist in sufficient

number to justify investigative powers with respect to them."

The Court applied the general principle, that "unless the Govern-

ment safeguards its own capacity to function and to preserve

the

security of its people, society itself could become so dis-.

ordered that all rights and liberties would be endangered."

Nevertheless, the central holding of the Keith decision was that

this pover may not be exercised in such a way as to infringe

constitutional rights. 407 U.S. 297 (1972).

Even though the President may have the authority under

the Constitution to direct the FBI to conduct intelligence

investigations in the absence of legislation, Congress has the

ultimate authority to substitute statutory authorization in

place of the Presidential directives. As Jüstice Robert Jackson

declared in the Steel Seizure Case, "When the President takes

measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of

Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb.

343 U.S. 579,

637.

Option One -- Patifying Existing Powers

The first option for Congress is legislation ratifying

the existing. authority granted to the FBI by current Presiden

tial directives and orders. Such legislation would be cast in

extremely general terms. Its main advantage is that it would

provide a basis for Congressional oversight. It could also

reinforce the Attorney General's role as the immediate super-.

VISOI Of FBI intelligence activities. The statute would

authorize the Attorney General to direct the FBI:

..1. to conduct investigations of domestic espionage;

counterespionage, sabotage, and subversive activities;.

2.

to gather and report information on civil distur-

bances;

..

3. to conduct investigations of other related intelli-

gence matters affecting internal

security; and

4. to conduct investigations of official matters relat-

ing to the Department of State.

In addition, the statute would require the Attorney General

to repoit annually to the appropriate Congressional

committees

on the volume and type of investigations and reports, the

investigative techniques used, and the policies and procedures

adopted by the Justice Department and the FBI.

The weaknesses of this approach are obvious. Congress

would have legislated a wholesale delegation of power without

IN 55013 DocId:92989602 Page 18

---

## Page 19

-•8

standards or limitations other than the supervision of the

Attorney General and. oversight by Congress.. In view of the

select Committee's findings as to the vast overbreadth of FBI

domestic intelligence investigations and the abuses committed

in the name of "counterintelligence", Congress would in effect

be permitting future expansion of FBI operations to match past

policies.

C. Option Two -- A Separate Security Intelligence Agency

Congress might give serious consideration to legislation

creating a separate Security Intelligence Agency within the

Justice Department. It would perform the functions of the

present Counterintelligence Branch of the FBI Intelligence

Division; dealing with foreign intelligence and counterintelli-

"gence/counterespionage. The FBI itself has considered this

option as part of the larger question of separating all FBI

• intelligence functions from the

law enforcement functions of

the Bureau. (Tab 'E)

A separate agency would be justified only if it was

authorizea to conduct investigations of a wider scope

and using

different techniques than would otherwise be permitted. In

other words, Congress could decide that foreign counterintelli-

gence investigations should go beyond investigation of specific

crimes, that techniques such as electronic surveillance should

be used without a warrant or with a special type of warrant,

WH 55013 DocId:32989602

Page 19

---

## Page 20

and that operations should be conducted to "counter" foreign

intelligence activities by means other than arrest or "persona

non grata". proceedings. On the other hand, if congress treats

the investigation of foreign intelligence activities the same

as a criminal investigation, then the FBi should keep the job.

Any statute in this area must use general language for

diplomatic reasons. For example, Congress should not explicitly

authorize deception operations or efforts to compromise hostile

intelligence officers,

even though such techniques may be

envisioned. Such techniques are dealt with best by establish-

ing adequate procedures for authorization and oversight to

ensure accountability.

The legislation should be more specific where it deals

with investigations and other operations directed at American

citizens rather than non-resident aliens in the service of a

foreign power.. If Congress believes Americans should be inves-

tigated if they have a marked potential

L. for use

by a foreign

intelligence service, but no information indicating intelligence

activity yet exists, the legislation should say so.

The statute

should also set out standards for determin-

ing whether a foreign-dominated domestic organization falls

within the jurisdiction of the separate agency. There should

at the very least be substantial information indicating that

the organization is directed by, subsidized by, or in active

collaboration with a foreign government or organization. (The

term "foreign organization" refers, for instance, to

a group

like the Palestine Liberation Organization.) If the group fits

the criteria for foreign

domination, there should be an addi-

tional finding that it may engage in intelligence activities or

in activities involving the use of violence in violations of

federal law.

.:If the group meets all these standards, Congress may

authorize the investigation of its activities going beyond

regular criminal investigations. Such investigations. could

extend to all individuals who are members of, or express sup-

port for, the organization, as well as to the efforts of the

organization to influence and control other groups: However,

it may be sufficient to authorize only the investigation. of

active members and supporters. This would prevent a revival

of the "Cominfil" policy of looking into all forms of lawful

political and social activity where Communists might be involv-

ed.

The Petersen Committee report on COINTELPRO considered

the need for special supervision of foreign counterintelligence

operations in the United States. It recommended the creation

of a Foreign Intelligence Advisosy Commission

to make decisions

with regard to the necessity or acceptability of particular

• foreign counterintelligence techniques. (Tab F) This proposal

cono

has merit in view of the limited amount of time the Attorney

General can give to personal supervision

and the after-the-fact

role of legislative oversight regarding the separate

agency:

Finally, legislation to create a separate foreign.

counterintelligence agency must deal with relationships to the

Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department, and other

foxeign intelligence agencies. The current FBI-CIA agreement

on their respective jurisdictions is only a "memorandum of under-

standing". It allows the CIA to undertake certain clandestine -

activities within the United States, in coordination with the

FBI. (Tab G) Proposals are currently circulating in the

Execu-

tive Branch for a new National Security Council Intelligence

Directive to clarify this matter, as well as to regulate CIA

electronic surveillance of American citizens abroad. (lab H)

A full draft of a statutory charter for a separate

foreign counterintelligence agency is not included here, since

the focus is on domestic intelligence issues. However, one

implication of such a statute would be that the remaining FBI

functions should relate only to law enforcement and criminal

investigations.

D. Option Three -- Elimination of FBI Domestic Intelligence

The basic assumption behind Attorney General Levi's

effort to develop "guidelines"

for FBI domestic intelligence

is that regular criminal investiyations are not adequate to

HH 55013 DocId/92989602 Page 22

---

## Page 23

12

.

supply the information needed to anticipate or prevent the use

of violence in violations of federal. law. That assumption.

should be questioned. Regular criminal investigations are

likely to produce a substantial amount of information which

can be used to anticipate or prevent future crimes. For example,

intensive criminal investigations of Ku Klux KIan violence in

the South during the 1960's would have required the FBI to 100k

into a wide variety of Klan activities. Another example is the

search for weatherman fugitives, a regular criminal investiga-

tion which involves broad inquiries

across the country. The

FBI has not yet demonstrated that the preventive information

it has obtained came from intelligence investigations which

would not have been conducted as regular criminal investigations.

The fact that an FBI investigation was supervised by

its Intelligence Division does not necessarily mean that the

investigation was, automatically, outside

the regular criminal

law enforcement jurisdiction of the Bureau. Any FBI investiga-

tion of activities involving the use of violence in violations

of federal law falls within that jurisdiction. Moreover,

regular criminal investigations can also extend to plans,

attempts, or conspiracies to engage in such activities.

One suggested difference between intelligence-type and

regular criminal investigations is that the latter are

•terminated after a reasonable time, if sufficient evidence to

NW 55013 DocId:32989602 Page 23

---

## Page 24

o 13

justify prosecution is not obtained. However, there is no

legal. reason why the prosecutor cannot request that the inves-

tigation continue indefinitely as long as there is information

that violent activities and plans for violence are still under-

way. The degree of evidence needed to justify a prosecution

is certainly greater than the degree of evidence needed to

justify an investigation.

All this is not to say that no further standards are

needed to guide regular criminal investigations when they may

touch on sensitive First. Amendment or other constitutional

interests. This is especially true of criminal investigations

of individuals or groups engaged both in lawful political, or

social activities and in unlawíul violence or plans for vio-

•lence. To what extent is the advocacy of violence a proper

basis for initiating an investigation? Should an investigation

be initiated on the basis of allegations or other information

that an individual is a member of, or has expressed public

support for, an organization which has as one of its objectives

the use of violence?

Should an

investigation be started on all

members

and public supporters of an organization, some of whose

members have acted in concert to use violence?

These questions are addressed in the draft Attorney

• General's guidelines for domestic intelligence investigations

under the heading "preliminary investigations". (Tab I) Since

WH 55013 DocId:@2989602

Page 24

---

## Page 25

- 14

the guidelines assume that there should be intelligence inves-

tigations, they.

do not consider whether such investigations:

might be permitted as regular criminal investigations.

The Klan and Weatherman examples again illustrate the

point. Once it has been established that a particular Klan •

group is engaged in or planning violence, it seems reasonable

to conduct at least preliminary inquiries to determine whether

the members and supporters of the group are invoived in the

violence .or the plans for violence. Similarly, the search for

Weatherman fugitives who committed bombings and other

acts of

violence would appear reasonably to include preliminary

inquiries to determine whether other Weatherman members and

supporters have harbored the fugitives:

on the other hand, it would seen unreasonable to

investigate members and supporters of all Kian groups across

the country on

the ground that some Klan groups have used

violence. And it appears equally unreasonable to investigate

all members and supporters of SDS because the weatherman

faction engaged in violence. The scope of the investigation

must be logically related to its specific purpose, and not an

excuse for wide-ranging collection of intelligence.

There is one possible exception to the requirement that

• the FBI only conduct regular criminal investigations. The

Attorney General (and the President) do require reports on

HH 55013 DocId&32989602 Page 25

---

## Page 26

15

major civil disturbances which

may not involve violations of

federal law. The FBI should be authorized to gather such data

and make appropriate reports as

part of its law enforcement

responsibilities. However; the data and reposts should be

limited to information provided by local or state law enforce-

ment authorities or obtained in the course of a regular FBI

criminal investigation. Where local authorities provide infor-

mation about individuals

and organizations which are not the

subject of a regular FBI criminal investigation, the data and

reports should not be included in the FBI's general files and

nane index.

In periods of widespread civil disturbances, the

Attorney General may require a more systematic procedure for

maintaining and retrieving civil disturbance information. This

was the case in 1967, when Attorney General Clark created the

Interdivisional. Intelligence Unit in the Justice Department.

The IDIU stoxed and indexed civil disturbance reports separately

from the FBI. The data was used to help anticipate or ameliorate

disorders. IDIU has been abolished, although the basic function

of evaluating reports on civil disturbances is still performed

by the Justice Department. This function should also be

authorized by statute, and the intent of Congress should be

that the Attorney General must obtain specific legislative

authorization for any future IDIU.

WW 55013 DocId:32989602 Page 26

---

## Page 27

IDIU was not perfect. Under Attorney General John

Mitchell it supplied a list of names of American dissidents

to the CIA.: (Tab J) It also was used in conjunction with

grand jury proceedings inquiring into

terrorist bombings.

•Both of these activities should be forbidden by the statute

authorizing the Justice Department to evaluate civil distur

bance information.

Finally, legislation may be needed to make clear that

the

FBI is not authorized to conduct investigations of organi-

zations or individuals for the specific purpose of compiling

a body of data to be used in connection with name checks under

the Federal Employee Security Program. The same principle

applies to FBI "assistance" to the Secret Service, under the

present FBI-Secret Service agreement.

A statute must also address the FBI's current practice

of maintaining an Administrative Index (ADEX) of the prime

subjects of current domestic intelligence investigations. The

past history of the FBI's Security Index and other target lists

(Key Activists, Agitator Index, Key Black Extremists) suggests

the need to enact legislation banning the compiling of lists

of persons by the FBI, unless such persons have been arrested

or convicted for specific crimes and the list is used in con-

nection with the investigation of such crimes.

HH 55013 DocIds32989602 Page 27

---

## Page 28

- 17:-

These proposals to limit the FBI to regular criminal

investigations and civil disturbance reporting must be tested

against the actual past experience of the Justice Department

•and the FBI. General instructions from the Department to the

Bureau may be overly vague, even within the framework of

criminal investigation. Iwo examples are Attorney General

Clark's memorandum on riots in 1967 and Assistant Attorney

General Yeagley's memorandum of campus disorders in 1969. (Tab

K) The Nation of Islam exchange between the Department and the

FPI in 1973-74 is another illustration. (Tab L)

Thus, there is no automatic panacea in restricting the

FBI to criminal investigations. The need for careful scrutiny

of actual investigative policies and practices by Congress

the Attorney General is just as great as if the EBI were

authorized to conduct domestic intelligence investigations.

Legislation must focus on procedures for ensuring accountability

•by regular repoits from the Attorney General. to the appropriate

Congressional committees.

The following are some of the basic elements which should

go into a statute embodying this option. It would authorize the

Attorney General to direct the FBI:

•1. to investigate violations of federal criminal laws,

provided that the scope and duration of the investigation are

logically related to its specific purpose;

W 55013 DocTi(32989602 Page 28

---

## Page 29

- 18.-

2.

to take only such investigative measures as are

sanctioned by rule of law, procedure, oi judicially recognized

or accepted investigative practices, and are not. in violation

of state or federal law;

3. to seek legal advice from the Attorney General or

his designee whenever a proposed action may be perceived, with

reason, to unfairly affect the rights of citizens, provided that

this responsibility to seek legal advice is the duty of both the

FBI as an institution and FBI agents as individuals;

4.: to collect information from state and local law.

enforcement agencies regarding major civil disturbances, provia-

ed that such information is not entered into the FBI general

files and name index;

5. to disseminate information obtained from criminal

investigations for the following purposes, under regulations

promulgated by the Attorney General and published in the Federal

Register:

prosecution of violations of criminal laws;

b. prevention or anticipation of violations of

criminal laws;

c.

assistance to the Secret Service in the perfor-

mance of its protective responsibilities;

a. determination of the suitability of individuais

for employment by the federal government;

to report civil disturbance information obtained

from state and local law enforcement agencies to the Attorney

General for the purpose of determining the need to use federal

E.

Option Four -- Setting Standards for Domestic Intelligence

The FBI should be authorized by statute to conduct

domestic intelligence investigations only if Congress finds

(1) that regular criminal investigations as described above

would not provide information to anticipate or prevent the use

of violence in violations of federal law, and (2) that the inci-

dents

of the use of violence in violations of federal law are

so numerous and so serious as to constitute a significant threat

to the internal security or domestic tranquility of the United

States.

The fact that there are individuals and groups who

engage in violence, advocate violence, or believe in the desir-

ability of the ultimate use of violence to advance their

political or social objectives is not enough to justify FBI

domestic intelligence authority. There must be additional

findings that regular criminal investigations are inadequate

and that

the overall threat of violence

constitutes a serious

danger to the country.

Furthermore, if FBI domestic intelligence is authorized

by statute, it should be an annual authorization which must be

renewed

each year upon reconsideration by Congress and the

Attorney General of these factors. Past experience indicates

that the annual appropriations process does not provide an

appropriate forum for considering

the FBI's basic authority.

IN 55013 DocId 32989602 Page 31

---

## Page 32

- 21 -

Attorney General Levi's draft guidelines provide a basis

for the consideration of a domestic intelligence authorization.

They do not cover the investigation of foreign-related

activities which may be directed by, subsidized by, or other-

wise conducted in active collaboration with a foreign government,

a foreign organization, or their agents. (See Option Two above.)

The guidelines deal with five different types of threats

of violence which may constitute serious dangers to the country:

1. overthrow of the government (revolutionary violence);

: 2.: interference in the U. S. with the activities of a

foreign government (bombing a consulate, attempting to assassi-

nate a visiting foreign leader);

3. interference with the functioning of the government

or the flow of interstate commerce to influence federal policies

(violent protest activities, terrorist bombings);

4. deprivation of civil rights (klan violence, violent

protest against busing);

5. incitement of violence which may require the use of

federal military force (riots, major civil disturbances accom-

panying protest demonstrations).

The guidelines also refer to violence directed at state govern-

ments, either overthrow of a state government

or interference

with the functioning of a state government.

HH 55013 DoOId:92989602 Page 32

---

## Page 33

• - 22 .-

Authorizing legislation should indicate whether domestic

intelligence is necessary. for any or all of these specific prob-

lems. For example, revolutionary violence, in an attempt to

overthrow the government may be a remote and speculative danger,

while terrorist bombings may be substantially interfering with

the functioning of the government. Klan violence was unques-

tionably a serious danger to civil rights in the early. and mid-

1960's, but is it so today? Major riots and civil disturbances

were egually serious in the late 1960's and early 1970's, but

not in more recent years. Violent interference with the func-

tioning of a state government should, under our federal system,

normally be dealt with by state and local law enforcement.

Therefore, the definition of the purpose of FBI domestic

intelligence can be simplified. The Attorney General's draft

guidelines might be revised to authorize FBI domestic intelli-

gence investigations:

1.

to ascertain facts or information which serves to

anticipate and prevent the use of violence in violations of

federal law intended to

a. interfere, in the United States, with the

activities of a foreign government or its authorized represen-

tatives; and

HH 55013 DocId:92989602 Page 33

---

## Page 34

- 23

b. interfere with the functioning of the government

of the United States or the free flow of. interstate commerce in

order to influence policies or decisions of the federal govern-

ment:

This formulation concentrates on the most likely current serious

danger to the country, namely, politically motivated terrorist

violence. FBI Director Kelley's recent public statements have

stressed the increase in terrorist activity from 24 bombings in

1973 to 45 terroxist bombings in 1971 and 46 such bombings in

the first six months of 1975.

However, this increasing threat is not the only factor

to be considered. In the course of the FBI's regular criminal

investigations of these bombings and other incidents of tercor

ist violence, can it obtain as a by-product substantial infor-

mation which may serve to anticipate and prevent future vio

lence? If so,, the need for broader intelligence-type investi-

gations is less evident.

The draft guidelines provide that the FBI would conduct

full-scale intelligence investigations on the basis of

"specific and articulable facts justifying the conclusion"

that an individual, or individuals acting in concert, may be

engaged in activities which may involve the use of violence in

violations of

federal. law. The two "mays" render

the require-.

ment of "specific and articulable facts" almost meaningless.

Therefore, any legislation should

i authorize the FBI:

HH 55013 DocId 32989602 Page 34

---

## Page 35

- 24

2.

to conduct full domestic intelligence investigations

on the basis of specific and articulable facts justifying the

conclusion that an individual, or individuals acting in concert,

are engaged in activities which are likely to involve the use

of violence as described in 1 above.

The draft guidelines also discuss the surveillance tech-

niques to be used in full domestic intelligence investigations, •

including informants, mail covers, and electronic surveillance.

The guidelines note that additional techniques may need to be

covered, such as inquiries made under "pretext", photographic

surveillance, "trash

covers", etc. However,. the legislation may

deal with techniques more generally by providing that the

FBI

is authorized:

3. to take only such investigative measures as are

sanctioned by rule of law, procedure, or judicially recognized

or accepted investigative practices, and are not in violation

of state or federal law.

More detailed regulation of investigative techniques for full

investigations will be considered elsewhere.

The scope of domestic intelligence investigations under

the draft guidelines is broadened considerably under the pro-

vision for "preliminary investigations". They can be

initiated on the basis of allegations of other information that

• an individual, or individuals acting in concert, have advocated

activities which may involve violence, or are members of, or

**.

-- 25 =

have expressed public support for, an organization which has

as its objective activities which may involve violence. The

purpose

of the preliminary investigation is to verify of refute

the allegations or information:

However, the vagueness of the

standara is obvious. Therefore, to be consistent with the

criteria for full investigations, the FBI should be authorized:

• 1: to conduct preliminary domestic intelligence inves-

tigations on the basis of allegations or other information that

an indiviaual, or individuals acting in concert,

a. advocate the use of violence as described in 1

above;

b. are engaged in activities which are likely, to

involve the use of violence as

described in 1 above;

c.. are members of or have expressed public support

for an organization engaged in activities which involve, or are

Likely to involve, the use of violence as described in 1 above,

provided that other members of the organization are currently

the subject of a full domestic intelligence investigation or a

regular criminal investigation.

Unless these changes are made in the guidelines, they would per

mit investigations similar to past investigations which have

been seriously criticized.. For instance, they would allow in-

vestigations of all SDS members or all Black Student Union lead-

ers. on the ground that their activities may involve violence,

N 55013 DocId:32989602. Page 36

---

## Page 37

- 26 -

even though there is no specific allegation of likely involve-

ment in violence.

Another reason for the revision is to exclude those

investigations which would be justified as regular criminal

investigations. Thus, allegations or other information that

an individual, or individuals acting in concert, have engaged

in or plan to engage in activities which involve the use of

violence would fall within the FBI's regular criminal investi-

gative jurisdiction. Intelligence investigations would extend -

further at the preliminary stage to cover advocacy of violence

and membership in or public support for organizations involved

in or likely to be involved in violence. Full investigations

require a likelihood of violence, short of actual violence or

plans for violence.

Luis Manuel seo

Diego Emilio Bordas Hernandez and his brother,

Luis Manuel Alfredo Bordas, have emerged in the current

Dominican crisis as important financial, political and

military advisors to the deposed Dominican President Juan

Bosch in the latter's efforts to regain control of the

Dominican Government. Diego Bordas is a wealthy shipping

executive currently

residing in exile in San Juan,

Puerto Rico,

having been born in the Dominican Republic on January 11, 1923.

He served in various high posts under Juan Bosch during

latter's short occupancy of the position of President of the

Dominican Republic in early 1963. Bordas spends much of his

time at 368 Ashford Avenue in San Juan, using an apartment

at that address as his residence during the absence of its

owner, Jose Antonio Benitez Jiminez, from Puerto RICO.

Jose Benitez is the cousin of Jaime Benitez,

the latter the

Director of the University of Fuerto Rico and a close

• associate and advisor of

Juan Bosch.

Diego Bordas 215o

maintains a residence at 21 V, florencia,

pueblo Viego: a

suburb of San Juan, near the

current residence and headquarters

of Juan Bosch. Diego Bordas and his brother jointly operate

a shipping business known as Bordas and Company at Highway

Number 2, Puerto Viejo, Puerto Rico, and his financial

dealings

in support of

the Bosch efforts can reasonably be

expected to be conducted from this commercial establishment.

The Bordas brothers have both been the subjectsof

numerous allegations indicating their cooperation with

DO AS I SAY, NOT AS I DO

Martin Luther King, during the sanitation workers'

strike i: Memphis, Tennessee, has urged Negroes to boycott.

downtown white merchants to achieve Negro demands. On 3-29-68

King led a march for the sanitation workers. Like Judas leading

lambs to slaughter King led the marchers to violence,

and when

the violence broke out, king disappeared.

The fine Hotel Lorraine in Memphis is owned and

patronized exclusively by Negroes but king didn't go there

from his hasty exit.

Instead King decided the plush Holiday

Inn Motel, white owned, operated and almost exclusively white

patronized, was the place to "cool it."

There will be no

boycott of white aerchants for king, only for his followers.

Director Soc'y -

During a conference on 7/16/75 between the Assistant

J. Stanley Pottinger, and his staff and the

Director of the FBI and his staff, a question arose concernin:

Martin Luther King's alleged moving from one hotel or motel to

another hotel or motel in Memphis, Tennessee, prior to his murder

0n 4/4/68.

Attached is a letterhead memorandum (LHM) setting forth

an inquiry including a review of all appropriate Bureau files

regarding a proposal

made in memorandum G. C. Moore to Mr. W. C.

Sullivan dated 3/29/68 in connection with the counterintelligence

program wherein it was recommended that information be made

available to a cooperative news media source showing King to be

a hypocrite.

This was to be based on the fact that when violence

rose out during a march led by king in Memphis, lennessee, or

3/20/60, he disappeared.

There was a first class Negro hote.

in Memphis, the Hotel Lorraine

but King chose to hide out in

a white owned and operated Holiday Inn Motel (also known as the

Rivermont Motel).

The IHM will reflect and document the fact

that although a notation appears on the memorandum that it was

"handled" there is no information available to reflect that it

ever actually given to a cooperative news source.

P. Leinbaugh (retired), who placed the notation "handled" on the

document, absolutely has no recollection of this matter nor can

he state whether or not the information was disseminte 70

The time elements as documented

preclude the proposal contained in the 3/29/68 memorandum of

having any affect upon King's enoice of a motel in which to reside.

RECOMMENDATION:

2C JUL 29 1975

That the attached IHM along with attachments .ber

disseminated to the Department.

Martin Luther King, Jr., President of the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), today finds himself

in the embarrassing position of having

too much money, or at

least the probability of too much money. The SCIC sent out a

huge mailing to its contributors pleading for funds for the

Hashington Spring. Project, the "poor people's march on

Washington,"

Thousands of conclibutors were urged to support

the march financially in order to feed and house the demon-

strators. But the churches in the Washington, D. C., area

have offered to house and feed the demonstrators.

Now the contributions are beginning to roll in from

the mailing and King doesn't need the money. An embarrassment

of riches has befallen king, who will only use the money for .

other purposes. The churches had better come through with

all the housing and support the demonstrators need, because

there will b? little money left for the "poor people" by the

time the march rolls around.

A sanitation workers strike has been going on in

Memphis for some time. Martin Luther King, JI., today led a.

march composed of

5,000 to 6,000 people through the streets

of Memphis. King was in an automobile preceding the marchers.

As the march developed, acts of violence and vandalism broke

out including the breaking of windows in stores and some

looting.

This clearly demonstrates that acts of so-called

nonviolence advocated by King cannot be controlled. The same

thing could happen in his planned massive civil disobedience

for Washington in April.

Martin Luther King, J., President of the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference, injected himself into the

sanitation workers' strike in Memphis, Tennessee, and the

result of King's famous espoussl i nonviolence was vandalism,

looting, and riot.

Previously, King involved himself in this strike,

called for a general

strike, and called for a mass march.

Today he led the mass march in an automobile at the head of

the line. Negroes began shouting "black power" and trouble

began.

King, apparently unable or unwilling to control the

marchers, absented himself from the scene; window breaking and

looting broke out.

Police officers were forced to use gas to break up

the march and to control the crowd.

Enclosed is the original of a memorandum, with attach-

ment, concerning an interview of former FBI Assistant Director

Robert Wick by SSC Staff Members. Also enclosed is a copy of

the memorandum, with attachment, for forwarding to lit. James A.

Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the President.

Your specific attention is invited to certain infor-

mation relating to the interview of Wick suggestive of

improprieties on the part of an SSC Staff Member. The facts,

as known to this Bureau, are as follows.

Wick first contacted this Bureau concerning the inter-

view by telephone on November 5, 1975, to advise that he had

been called on October 31, 1975, by an individual identisying

hinself as Mike Epstein representing the SSC. Epstein requested

Wick to come to Washington, D. a., for a two to three hour

interview concerning a matter relating to his "employment."

Epstein did not further describe the subject matter of the

interview and an appointment was arranged for November 7, 1975.

Wick said that he was uncertain as to the probable subject

matter of the interview because other matters coming within his

responsibilities as Vice President of Pan American World Airways

which were unzelated to the FBI, have been of recent interest

to the SSC.

Wick asked for advice of the FBI concerning this

matter.

Thereupon, the Legal Counsel Division of this Sureau

contacted Ipstein and determined that the subject matter of

the interview of Wick would be Martin Luther King, JI.

return call was made to Wick on November 5, 1975,

to advise hin

The Attorney General

On November 6, 1975, Wick again telephoned this Bureau

and advised that he had been

rather annoyed at Epstein's

initial approach to him, particularly, because Wick had tried

on more than one occasion during the telephone conversation

with Epstein to pry from Epstein the subject matter of the

Interview but Epstein persisted in not advising him.

This Bureau's representative who had determined from

Epstein on November 5, 1975, the subject matter of the inter-

view has advised that when he made the inquiry of Epstein, he

asked epstein why he had not told wick the subject matter.

s reply was that Wick had not asked him, a statement

directly contradictory to Wick's advice to this Bureau.

The second suggested impropriety is that Epstein

contacted wick prior to advising this Bureau of his intention

to interview wick, an action which is contrary to procedures

which have been agreed upon between the SSC and this Bureau.

Re Los Angeles phone call to Assistant to the

Director JAMES B. ADAMS, 12/9/75.

On 12/3/75, the attached article appeared in the

Los Angeles Times under the byline of reporter JACK NELSON.

As indicated, the

headline and lead paragraph which supposed

is based on ADAMS' testimony, clearly reflects that the FBI

did nothing to prevent Klan violence although we knew of

the contemplated violence.

After discussing this matter with

Mr. ADAMS and reviewing the actual testimony received in

the Los Angeles Division on 12/8/75, SAC ELMER F. LINBERG

and I met with Editor BILL THOMAS and National Editor ED

GUTHMAN at the Los Angeles Times.

I advised these gentlemen that I was aghast when I

read the headlines and the lead paragraph of this article

and could not believe that JIM ADAMS did not refute informant

ROWE's testimony that we took no action relative to con-

templated violence since I knew that this was contrary to

che rules, regulations,

policy, and philosophy of the FBI

in 1960.

I then called Mr. ADAMS in Washington, D. C. , anc

he likewise, was

upset over the headline and lead paragraph,

because, according to ADAMS, he completely refuted these

statements in that we did disseminate the contemplated

plans of violence to the Birmingham Police Department and

Justice in the form of a letterhead

memorandum.

I continued that I waited until I received the

such testimony. I then proceeded to read several excerpts

from the testimony.

I advised Mr. THOMAS and Mr. GUTHMAN that my

immediate reaction was

to prepare a "Letter to the Editor"

but telt alter a re-analysis of the situation that this is

not a judgment question on the part of the newspaper, but

one of a slanted, inaccurate story either by design or

through misunderstanding.

I therefore felt that the Los

angeles limes, if it so desired, should be in a position to

correct the situation itself based on the facts.

Mr. THOMAS expressed appreciation for my approach

and stated that at the time he read the article, already

printed, a question came to his mind as to why the FBI did

not advise someone or take some action relative to contemplated

violence.

He, however, took no further action. He said

in view of what I had read from excerpts of Mr. ADAMS' testimony

and the now available complete transcript of the testimony,

he intends to pursue this matter further and would prefe

not to have a

'letter to the Editor'

any inaccuracies on the part of the Los Angeles Times througl

their own pursuit of further inquiring concerning this story.

the tet chen toe Angere Tie Brough

Mr. GUTHMAN concurred with Mr. THOMAS and they

indicated

that it appears the obvious question is based on

Mr. ADAMS' testimony of who in the Department of Justice

received this information relative to contemplated violence

and what did such a responsible Department of Justice official

do with the information. He agreed that based on the

information furnished to them, the FBI has been done an

injustice but that they, the Los Angeles Times, desired to

pursue this matter further.

It should be noted the article of JACK NELSON is

based on one specific situation, namely the testimony of

former informant GARY ROWE that

he had furnished advance

information to the FBI to the effect that members of the

Ku Klux Kian would be given the opportunity to beat members

of the Freedom Riders without interference by law enforcement

authorities for approximately 15 minutes after which the

local law enforcement authorities would take action, and

that the FBI was advised of this well in advance of

beatings and furthermore, the FBI took no action to prevent

Director Sof'y -

On 12-3-75 an individual who identified himself as Garland

Reeves of the Birmingham, Alabama, News, called and he advised that

he understood I was the Special Agent in Charge of the Birmingham Office

at the time the bus was burned with the Freedom Riders in Birmingham,

Alabama, in 1961. He stated that he would like to know if Rowe had fur-

nished us information that the Birmingham Police were going to wait 15

or 30 minutes to go to the bus station in order to give the Klan an oppor-

tunity to work over the Freedom Riders. I informed Reeves that I recalled

no such information being furnished to us at that time. I told him that all

intormation we received concerning possible violence was furnished to the

Birmingham Police Department.

He wanted to know, if there had been such

an agreement what action would I take. I told him that if I determined that

the police department, would not take any action for 15 or 30 minutes I would

advise the Mayor and city and the Police Commissioner and if they felt the

same as the police department,

would then advise, the Governor of the State.

He wanted to know what wollaGe the FBI's position at that time

if the police department refused to take any action. I told him that we did

not have jurisdiction in matters of this nature, that they were purely local

and it was the responsibility of the local authorities to handle such matters.

He desired to know if I would call out the Federal Marshals. I informed him

that the FBI did not have any authority to call upon the Federal Marshals in

a situation of this nature but if such a situation arose, I would have imme-

diately notified our headquarters in Washington, who would have notified the

Department of Justice, who would have such authority.

inform us about this. A notation by Mir. DeLoach indicated that Mr. Parsons

would meet with Navy on 3/11/50.

Memorandum dated 11/0/75 from W. O. Crogar to Mr. W. R. Wannall

is attached which sets forth details of our review of Navy files on this project,

including a Eurcau press release which was to have been made in the event

tat the Navy mentioned the FBI in their press relcase on this matter.

A review of Bureau files for information relating to drugs designed to

modily behavior indicates an interesi dating back to 1022. However, this

intcrest has not extended to the point where the Bureau has conducted research

on bchavior modifying drugs nor has it funded such rescarch. We lave maintained

liaison with other agencies, primarily the U. S. Army, and industrial orguniza-

tions in order to be avare of developments in this area.

On 7/30/74, Laboratory and Training Division representatives met

with ropresentatives of the Biomedical and Chemical Laboratories of

Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland, to discuss the potential use of incapacitating

chemical agents in hostage situations. Although we have developed an aware-

ness of various agents which may be used in these situations, we have not

conducted any rescarch with these agents. Memoranda on this matter are

located in Bufile 80-807.

A single instance occurred whore "truth serum" was administered in

a Burcau case. Truth serum was administered to Thurman Scruggs Wilkins

at his own request while being interviewed in the Los Angeles Office,

April 26, 1047. Willins was allegedly involved with one Ignacy Samuel

Witezal:,

the subject of a fovict espionage case (100-343077). The actual

drug uscd was sodiun amytal and the actal adminictration was done by a

physician. Prior Burezu authority was not obtained by the Los Angeles

Citice in connection with this incident. SAC Hood submitted a Ictter of

explanation to the Burezu on July 2, 1947. This incident resulted in the

following information being set forth in SAC Lettor 81-47 dated July 3, 1947:

"The Eurcau will not tolerate any experiments or participation

on the part of its personnel in the utilization of the so called truth

scrums or othor chomicala alleged to have a similar cucci.

consequently, in the cvent any Eurcau agent violates theso instructions,

drastic administrative action will be talen."

There was nothing found in Bureau files that would indicate that we

have received any documents from CIA concerning their drug research

programs. The files do reilect that we were aware that CIA was conducting

rescarch with lysorgic acid diethylamide (ISD) and that British Intelligence

had successfully utilized LSD en several Russian espionage ageats. The

information concerning CIA and British activities is sei out for the benefit

of the Dircetor only and cannot be relcased outsido thc Burcau.

Thero are two Burcau files which contain most of the intormation

rolating to tho immediate area of interoci of the captioned Scate Subcommittee.

These files are 62-2699 (Truth Serums) and 80-645 (Chemical Munitions and

Cascs). Pertinent serials may also be found in 80-807 and 100-313077 as

previously noted in this memorandum.

I sec no roason why Mr. Michie and Mr. Susman chould not be

indicate the FBI has nover cagaged in nor funded anyonc's efforts in researcha

and/or development programs in the use or elect of drugs on human behavior.

They should be advised our offorts in this regard as far as can be established

from the available records consists of following through liaison contacts with

other government agencies and the private sector sources the current

developments in behavior modifying drugs.

PRESS RELEASE

NOVEMBER 7, 1975

The press statement released by the Navy today

relating to its drug research on human subjects for the

period 1947 through 1954 indicates liaison concerning this

project was maintained by the Navy with other Governmental

agencies, including the FBI.

A thorough review of FBI files has discloséd one

document relating to this Navy research: a short internal

memorandum, dated August 4, 1950. This memorandun, prepared

by a member of the Liaison staff at FBI Headquarters, recorded

that a Navy official had invited FBI representatives to a

conference in the Washington area to "discuss the usage of

truth serum in Intelligence circles," and that the Navy had

-

made advances in developing a new drug which "could be utilized

to a great advantage in the questioning of espionage agents."

A handwritten notation on this memorandum directed that a

representative of the FBI Laboratory was to attend this

conference on August 11; 1950.

No further identifiable reference to Navy drug

developnent research is contained in FBI files. No record

can

be located that liaison was being maintained with the

Navy regarding this program, or that the FBI had knowledge

of this progral prior o lie dice di macaore i trian.

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

This is in response to the SSC letter dated

December 18, 1975, wherein Senators Mondale and Baker

requested rather detailed information to be made available

during the last week of December, 1975, and the first week

of January, 1976.

It is noted that most of the requests in this

letter are so ambiguous that they require clarification

from the SSC before the FBI can logically respond.

In one

instance, there is no way this Bureau could respond short

of obtaining the recollections of Bureau Supervisors who

worked in the Intelligence Division extending back almost

20 years. Because of this, ve are attaching for your

approval and forwarding to the SSC the original of a

memorandum which delineates the problems attendant to the

request of December 18, 1975, and, in most instances, requests

c1 3 29

a meeting between Mr. John Elliff, Domestic Task Force

Director, SSC, and representatives of this Bureau in the

hope that some alternatives or clarifications can be developed.

RE:

ATTORNEY CELTERAL FROM SENATORS

MONDALE AND BAKER

On December 22, 1975, this Bureau received a copy

of a letter dated Decenber 13, 1975, which Senators Mondole

and Baler sent to the Attorney General levying certain

requircments on the FBI with a request that the responses

be provided the sse during the last week of December, 1975,

and the first week of January, 1976.

Iten 1 requested access to materials in the

investigailve files for a six month period preccding acts

of violence which were prevented by actions taken by the FBI.

The specific preventive actions were set out in sone detall

in a menoranium prepared for the SSC by the FBI dated

December 10, 1975.

Upon receipt of referenced letter, the Intelligence

Division Initlated efforts to isolate the files documenting

these preventive actions. The Bureau's response of

December 10, 1975, was predieated on a review of the

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: DECIMBER 18, 1975, LETTER TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

FROM SENATORS MONDALE AND BAKER

there will be no investigative file but merely a communication

fron a field office reporting information furnished by a

source of the FBI on which some preventive action was

predicated. It is possible that the acts of violence

reported by the source could involve a violation over which

the FBI had no investigative jurisdiction. In such cases,

the local field office would have merely furnished the

information to the appropriate law enforcement agency and

no investigative file would exist.

We are continuing our efforts to attempt to

isolate those files which document preventive actions.

However, because of the problens attendant thereto, as well

as those problems raised in the subparagraphs of Item 1,

it is recommended that a meeting be arranged between Mi. John

Ell1ff, Domestic Task Force Director, and representatives

of this Bureau to discuss possible alternatives to some of

these requests.

Items 2 and 3 concern the September 24, 1975,

report to the House Judiciary Committee by the General

Accounting Office. The FBI is in the process of preparing

a response and it will be made available to the Committee

as soon as possible. However, it is noted that the FBI

prepared no analysis at all on the findings of the General

Accounting Office contained in their report of September 24, 1975.

Item 4 requests the annual reports from the

office of origin to FBI Headquarters for the investigation

of DI. Martin Luther King, JI., in 1963 through 1968, and

the Women's Liberation Movement for the years that organi-

zation was under investigation. Item 4 also requests anmal

reports available on the investigations "about which

materials were

supplied pursuant to John Elliff's request

of Actober 28."

RE: DECEMBER 18, 1975, LETTER TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAT

FROM SENATORS MONDALE AND BAKER

There were no annual reports subnitted by the

office of origin to FBI Headquarters for the investigation

of Martin Luther King, JI., in 1963 through 1968. With

regard to the Women's Liberation Movement, the SSC has been

provided copies of all pertinent reports for the years the

organization was under investigation. In an effort to

clarify what is meant by the anual reports available on

the investigations about which materials were supplied

pursuant to Mr. John Elliff's request of October 28, 1975,

it is again proposed that a meeting with Mr. Elliff be

arranged to clarify this ambiguity.

Item 5 requests specific examples of cases where

the FBI has taken action in the past similar to that which

would be authorized by Section IV of the Department of

Justice's guidelines draft on "Domestic Security Investigations."

The indices of this Bureau are not organized to

enable retrieval of information of a "preventive action"

Character

or examples of FBI actions taken to prevent

violence. The retrieval of such information from FBI files,

other than that described in the response to Item 1, would

require extensive review and/or dependence on the recollection

of individuals of occurrences extending back almost 20 years.

It is suggested that, during the proposed meeting with

Mr. John Elliff, this request be discussed.

Item 6 requests access to all FBI materials

pertaining to Martin Luther King, Jr., the Poor Peoples'

Campaign and the Sanitation Workers Strike in Memphis,

Tennessee, from Januaty 1, through April 4, 1968.

RE: DECEMBER 18, 1975, LETTER TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

FROM SENATORS MONDALE AND BAKER

It is this Bureau's belief that all pertinent

material pertaining to Martin luther King, JI., for the

period January 1, through April 4, 1968, has been made

available to the SSC responsive to previous requests. With

regard to the Poor Peoples' Campaign and the Sanitation

Workers Strike in Memphis, Tennessee, it is not clear

whether the letter is requesting access to the entire FBI

file on these two activities from the period January 1,

through April 4, 1968. It is recommended that a clarification

of this request can be accomplished during the previously

proposed neeting between Mr. John Elliff and representatives

of the FBI.

Item 7 requests all materials pertaining to.

"Project nvershoe."

A check of indices of the FBI regarding "Project

nvershoe," as well as the word nvershoe, fails to contain

any reference to either. Without additional information

regarding "Project overshoe," this Bureau cannot be

responsive to this specific request. Again, it is suggested

that, during the forthcoming meeting with John Elliff,

clarification of "Project nvershoe" be obtained.

centrate on matters relating to domestic intelligence

activities of the Federal government.

Our mandate is

report of findings of fact on

alleged abuses or excesses

by the FBI and other domestic intelligence agéncies; the

We are aware of the fine work in which your staff has

been engaged in these areas and hope that they will be

to be supplemented in several important respects and there-

fore finds it necessary to direct a number of requests to

the FBI for further information which we hope will be

treated on a priority basis so that the Subconmittee can

meet the deadlines set by the full committee.
