BRODKIN that his brother, "POPS" had become an alcoholic.

"PEANUTS" then complained concerning the way

the "G has been throwing the heat on" in Chicago since

his return

from

the State Penitentiary in Tennessee. He

complained that times have changed in this regard in

Chicago.

PANCZKO then advised that his nephew had become

a dope addict and mentioned that he had called the "pusher"

and in a very rough way instructed him to lay off selling

the stuff to his nephew.

PANCZKO then discussed the fact that he had been

brutally beaten by Warden GARFIELD (ph) at Ripley, State Pen,

Tennessee, and that when his sister visited him, she could

see the signs of his beating on him. She there fore

returned to Chicago where apparently she contacted BRODKIN

who instructed her to contact the FBI. PANCZKO then

described how he was contacted

and interviewed at Ripley

by FBI agents who took a signed statement from him showing

the violation of his civil rights. PANCZKO indicated that

he was never thereafter again beaten.

The conversation then changed to an associate of I//

PANCZKO, Chicago Top Jewel Thief, C veNDOL

BRODKIN

1e feels that "WENDOLA is a pigeon for that

lieutenant, ENGERS."

In speaking of "stool pigeons," BRODKIN mentioned

Ill.

was not true, and that FIORITO was a real "stand up

guy" and that BRODKIN would do anything for CARL.

In continuing this line of conversation, BRODKIN

and PANCZKO then discussed one "CHESTER" who "was a real

tough guy to get along with." This undoubtedly is a

reference to former Chicago Top Jewel Thief CHESTER GRAY,

who for some time was an informant of the Chicago Office.
