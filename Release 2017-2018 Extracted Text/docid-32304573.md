Re New York letter, to Bureau dated 4/21/64

requesting London to have British Security Service, MI-5 check

back records Victoria and Mayfair Hotels for any record of BOCK

and DEEGAN. Also, to determine if any officials of Chinese

Peoples Republic registered at these hotels during the pertinent

period. Is)

advised as follows:(S)

By letter dated 6/22/64 classified Secret, MI-5

MI-5 had the registers of the Victoria and Mayfair

Hotels checked back to the beginning of June 1963 but as suspected

no trace of BOCK or DEEGAN having stayed there was discovered.

No record of any official of Chinese Peoples Republic (CPR) was

discovered as having stayed at either hotel during the period in

question.

MI-5 points out it is very unusual for visiting Chinese

officialsto be booked into a hotel as they are normally accommo-

dated at one of the Chinese Diplomatic Mission (CDM) premises.

MI-5 is confident that any exception to this rule during the

pertinent period or at any other time would have come to its

attention. TANG MING CHAO did not visit the UK until later in

the year, that is, from 9/30 to 10/26/63 during which period he

was accommodated at the CDM main building. (5)

MI-5 speculates that if the names BOCK and

DEEGAN are bogus, as they apparently are, it wonders whether the

references to the two hotels are not equally fictitious.

MI-5

would be interested in ascertaining if the two envelopes involved

in this matter bear the hotels name in print or any other in-

signia that might indicate a clear connection with the Mayfair

and

Victoria Hotels.

available in the public rooms of the Mayfair but in the

Victoria Hotel there is a

guest house with no public rooms where

it islavariable to guests and is used only by the management (S)

MI-5

has inquired into the possibility of the Chinese having

acquired samples of the hotel's printed stationery direct fron

the printers as a result of which this has been ruled out.

MI-5 states if the envelopes concerned can be specifically

attributed to the two hotels it will consider examining its

records for information pertaining to contacts of the Chinese

who have in the past stayed in either of them. This, MI-5

points out, is quite a formidable task. MI-5

states over the

years the Mayfair Hotel has been used by contacts of the

Chinese but not as far as it can determine, the Victoria Hotel.(S)

MI-5 states it was interested in the possible

technique used and it might be of some significance that

use was calculated to mislead (s

concerning the envelopes as desired by MI-5 in a form

suitable for dissemination to it. (S)
