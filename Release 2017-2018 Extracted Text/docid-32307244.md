In May, 1952, former Bureau Agent DANIEL P. SULLIVAN,

Operating Director of the Crime Commission of Greater Miami,

made available a list of toll calls made from Key Largo, Florida,

Telephone Number 9951 listed to the Plantation Yacht Harbor,

Plantation Key, Florida.

This list reflected that on February

9, 1952; a call was placed to 86-6011, which was determined to

be a non-listed telephone subscribed to by JONNY B. SHATTEN,

115 N. Shore Drive, Normandy Isle, Apartment #4, Miami Beach,

Florida.

SHATTEN at that time was operating the Harbour Lounge,

a night club on the 79th Street Causeway between Miami and

Miami Beach.

It was then rumored that he was merely a "front"

for SAMUEL P. COHEN, FBI Number 840189, of the Miami Beach S & G

Gambling Syndicate.

On February 9, 1955, Confidential Informant MM 315-C,

of known rellability, stated

that the last he heard of JONNY B.

SHATTEN was that he had been in Cuba.

He stated that SHATTEN

reportedly had obtained some money from his wife and invested 1t

with NORLE-ROTHMAN, FBI Number 152585B in the Sans Souct Night

Club, Havana, Cuba.

The Informant stated that SHATTEN is no

longer interested in that club and that ROTHMAN now has but a

small Interest.

He stated that MARIINE FOX, a Cuban who has long

been connected with the Tropicana Night Club in Havana, now

controls the Sans souci.
