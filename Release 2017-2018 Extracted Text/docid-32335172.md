Since this time, HART has been interested in learning

all he can concerning the people who lte and work in the area

where this cemetery 1s located. On 9/25/61 HART advised he had

learned from HENDERSON that about six men in a car with a

Tennessee Tag and a pickup truck had brought one of the bodies to

the cemetery..

HART claimed this made sense, since he had learned

from a member of the Minute Men that the burial of the arms was

supervised from Mount Eagle, Tennessee.

J. T. HENDERSON has

since indicated a desire to join the Minute Men and has furnished

his $25.00 Initiation fee, but as of this date has not been sworn

the letter was reportedly sent by LOUIS G. MARTON and makes

reference to a meeting held in Washington, D. C., on the 13th,

month not named, and sets forth'his reactions concerning the

meeting.

The letter alleges all actions of the Supreme Court of

the U. S. have been null and void since 10/24/45 and the U. S.

has had no legal Government of any kind since that time.

letter urges the establishment of a "mighty, patriotic Army of

Minute Men" to restore to the U. S. Its lost constitutional

liberties and its national independence.

had in the Atlanta area approximately 57 groups.

HART has told

the informant that a group of five men make up a unit but at

one time told the informant that they had as many as 25 men in

a group but that no more than five of these men met together.

HART claimed he felt he would soon get some sealed orders from

headquarters and claimed he had been given another state and would

have more to do. HART claimed he had not received any money for

expenses and hoped they would soon send him some as he was not a

rich man. HART Indicated that they would soon have 20,000 to

Orlando, Florida, to bring instructions.

He stated the head

of the organization is a retired General from the U. S.

Army and all members carry .410 gas guns.

a secret oganization.

He indicated the purpose of the Minute

Men Is to eliminate certain leaders or anyone, in fact, who

to fly to South America and bring back a rare deadly poison,

more deadly than curare.

This poison will be used to eliminate

enemies of the Minute Men leaving no trace in the blood.

a meeting which was to be held sometime during the week of

11/6/61.

considered as the person to be delegated to do away with one

of the political leaders in the Atlanta area. HART told him

It would either he him or another member to do the job.

Mayflower organization. HARD did not expand any further

Mayflower organization,

Division fails to reflect any reference for the Mayflower

organization. ATKINSON is associated with HART in attempting
