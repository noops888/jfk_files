PCS/LOC Memorandum to PC/HSCA,

29 June 1978

In discussing the paragraph 3 requirement in

reference A for names of the Chiefs and Deputy Chiefs of

the 6 Research Section in 1960-62 with one of the former

Deputy Branch

Chiefs of SR-6, we were made aware of the fact

that SR-6 had

a Section called the Research Section which

later was called the Operational Support Section.

We had been

under the impression that the HSCA was interested in the

identities of the Chiefs and Deputy Chiefs of SR-6, which was

1961-62.

Mr. Balaban resigned in 1970 and we have no

address. He had been assigned to the Section from August

1960 to April 1964.

3. One of the ranking officers in the Section and an

Acting Chief was Mr. Donald E. Poole, retired, c/o Marvin

Hayes,

3006 Scotty Drive, Jacksonville, Florida 32216,
