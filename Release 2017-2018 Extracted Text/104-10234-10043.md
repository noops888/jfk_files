1. THE LAST SECRET WRITING MESSAGE FROM AMTRUNK/10 WAS

RECEIVED AT WAVE IN JULY 1964.

PREVIOUS TO THIS MESSAGE, WAVE

HAD RECEIVED ONLY CHE OTHER S/W LETTER FROM AMTRUNK/1O SINCE HIS

RECRUITHENT IN HAVANA IN AUGUST 1963• BY CONTRAST, WAVE SENT 10

S/W MESSAGES TO AMTRUNK/10 DURING THE PERIOD FROM SEPTEMBER 1963

THROUGH AUGUST 1564.

SINCE AMTRUNK/1O HAD DEMONSTRATED LITTLE

INITIATIVE IN COOPERATING WITH KUBARK AND SINCE HE HAS ALSO

CHONGISCO IN THE ALASH COMPLEX, WAVE DECIDED AGAINST CONTIMUING

TO PROD AMTRUNK/10 TO TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THE MHAPRON OBJECTIVES

ASSIGNED TO HIM.

WAVE HAS THEREFORE DISCONTINUED ANY FURTHER

CORRESPONDENCE WITH AMTRUNK/ 10.

THE KEY TO AMTRUNK/1O'S PRESENT SITUATION IN CUBA MIGHT

BE FOUND IN THE HEADQUARTERS-DIRECTED AMLASH/ I OPERATION, THE

STATUS OF WHICH IS PRESENTLY UNCLEAR TO WAVE.

ANOTHER COMPLICATING FACTOR MAY BE THE ARREST IN LATE

DECEMBER 1965 OF ANTRUNS/11, A SUPPORT ASSET KNOWN TO AKTRUNK/10.

THE OHLY DETAILS KHOW TO WAVE SURROUNDING THE ARREST OF AMTRUNK/18

ARE FOUND IN REFS E AND G.

WAVE BELIEVES IT POINTLESS TO QUESTION NIEVES FURTHER ON

AMTRUNK/10, SINCE INFO THUS FAR PROVIDED, LIKE ALL NIEVES® INFO,

HAS BEEN INCONSISTENT.

WHILE IN 16 JANUARY 66 DEBRIEFING NIEVES

SAID AMTRUNK/10 WAS ONE OF SIX CENMANDERS OF HIS GROUP WHO WERE

THE CRCUP.

ENTIRE CONSPIRATORIAL GROUP IS

A FIGMENT OF NIEVES IMAGINATION.
