MCCLOY INTERVIEWED BY

INVESTIGATION

4 Dec 63 1000

Routine

For

In conversation with me, MCCLOY, a member of the presidential

commission stated that' he has serious doubts of the credibility

of the investigation to date. He does not eliminate the possibility

that the attempt on KENNEDY was made by two persons. However, in

view of JOHNSON's order that the commission investigate also the

circumstances of OSWALD's slaying, some of the commission's

operations and its report could come after RUBY's trial and perhaps

even postpo the verdi and sy sle, In the meate the to the

press information that their investigation confirms OSWALD's guilt,

and that he had no accomplices.
