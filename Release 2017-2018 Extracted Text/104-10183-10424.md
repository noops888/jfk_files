1.

Carlos has never been active in politics and voted only

once in his life - for a candidate of the Authentic Party.

However, he has been active in revolutionary and counter-

revolutionary activities since 1952.

During

the year 1952-53

he began conspiring against BATISTA acting as an acconnodation

addressee for Jose Antonio ECHEVARRIA (now deceased) and close

associates of ECHEVARRIA, inclading Rolando CUBELAS.

During

he came to know Jose VENEGAS Valdespino,

known as

"El Chino";

but Carlos

never was friendly with VENEGAS knowing him only as

an associate of Rolando CUBELAS in student activities.

During the revolutionary activity against 34rISrs,

ECHEVARRIA and CUBELAS had as much or more prestige than Fidel

CASTRO but after BATISTA fled from Cuba, Fidel CASTRO maneuvered

himself into control-of all of Cuba to the detriment of other

revolutionary leaders.

CUBELAS accepted CASTRO's leadership

at first but became disenchanted as CASTRO turned towards

communism and as CASTRO neglected the other revolutiorar

leaders who had struggled against BATISTA.

CASTRO's attitudes and actions, many of the old revolutionaries

began working against the CASTRO regime in the same way as they

those close to him, including Carlos, are covered in a separate

by the Cuban security service.

Carlos learned this through a

telephone call made by DE LEON. DE LEON said that the mother of

her sister in Havana with the foregoing news.

The letter said

that "El Loco" is not in jäil and has been able to visit relatives

but that he must appear for questioning throughout the day and

is not allowed to sleep at home.

not talk to anyone about it.)

"El Mago"

ROBRENO is a thoroughly irresponsible

man whom Ramiro VALDEZ, Minister of Interior, forced to leave

Cuba because ROBRENO had caused so much

worked throughout his life.

ROBRENO admires and is loyal to Rolando CUBELAS.

Carlos believes that

Carlos that the Agency has had abundant opportunity to deal with

ARTIME - whom Rolarido does not trust and who told Rolando that

the Ágency was offering its help through him, ARTIlE.

Rolando considered that the injection of ARTIME was a

plot, could have used and still should use Carlos as the

intermediary.

suspect that Carlos is connected with the Agency; CARRILLO knows

that Carlos is a friend of Rolando but does not know anything

about Rolando's plot against Fidel.

The dealings

between

CARRILLO and Carlos in connection with the latter's purchases

of Cuban government jewelry arose because Carlos once had priced

jewelry in Havana.

CARRILLO remembered this and offered to sell

jewelry to Carlos.

When Carlos bought jewelry (on our behalf),

Carlos proposed to CARRILLO that the latter tell the Cuban

government that the jewelry was being sold at a lesser price

than that which Carlos was paying.

advantages of giving the FLUTTER examination at Miami are

One is that at Miami we do have a Spanish speaking

operator. Although TEPEDINO has adequate English for business

purposes, he does not feel at home in the language and quite

often misinterprets the English expressions.

Another advantage

is that testing at Miami by individuals who have not been

connected and who are not likely to be connected with him in the

future should provide an objective assessment and should not

interfere with the rapport necessary to maintain good relations
