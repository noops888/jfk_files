C. ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES

General Information of a Criminal Nature Relating tothe

LA. ROCCA - GENOVESE Organization Obtained Through Informant

Coverage.

PG I-1 has advised that there is a definite possibility that

the PRUNER brothers, officials at LA ROCCA's North Star

Cement Block Company in Pittsburgh, have transferred stock

in AT &T to LA ROCCA and that neither LA ROCCA nor the PRUNERS

have listed this stock on their income tax returns. He further

explained that although LA ROCCA has sold stock in the North

Star Cement Block Company, he is holding this stock as security

for his employees until they can come up with a set sum.

The

Informant stated that he does not think that either LA ROCCA or

brothers have threatened to

"talk" If the stocks are not returned

to them so they can be transferred and LA ROCCA given his money.

The informant estimated that ROY VEY, another company executive,

and the PRUNER brothers owe roughly $40,000 to LA ROCCA personally

or $80,000 to the corporation, and that if either of these amounts

Is paid, the stock will be returned to them.

GEORGE ARMSTRONG, Vice-President, Stock Issue Corporation, AT & T,

50 Varick Street, New York City,

advised on April 25, 1961, that

a thorough review of all his records fails to indicate that

ALDO and ALMO PRUNER hold any stock in AT & T nor have they

held any stock at any time in the past.

On May 3, 1961, ARMSTRONG advised that JOHN S. LA ROCCA and

MARY LA ROCCA, 900 West Ingomar Road, Pittsburgh, Pa., opened an

account with AT & T on April 21, 1901, with a purchase of 39

shares of AT & T stock on that date.

The stock records note

them as joint tenants with right of survivorship.
