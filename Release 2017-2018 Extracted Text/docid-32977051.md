OPERATION MONGOOSE

PHASE I (CLA)

ACTIVITY

INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS

1. * Dispatch one intelligence

agent operation to key area

selected by CLA.

TOP SECRET SENSITIVE

1 - 15 March 1962

PURPOSE

CONSIDERATIONS

Collect and report intelligence on anti-

regime attitudes, on potential resist-

ance, and on vulnerabilities and

strengths of Communist security

system.

There is a risk that this action will disclose this U.S.

intelligence activity within Cuba. Selected personnel

are being intensively trained. This first team has 2

agents.

An area in which resistance has been reported

has been selected. Agent operations must stay alive,

Physical risk to personnel is substantial, due to lack

of intelligence. First reports from firet team are

expected by the end of March, while reporte from the

second and third teams, dispatched in March, are ex-

pected to start in April.

Many of the agents infiltrated into Cuba will be trained

for paramilitary skille as well as intelligence collection,

with the thought that they will be in place inside Cuba

and ready to act whenever paramilitary operatione are

decided upon. However, CLA has noted that, once the

agents are inside Cuba, they cannot be controlled

effectively from outside Cuba, although every effort

will be made to attempt such control.

These staff intelligence officers may also be used in the

future for communications or agent handling, if future

developments warrant.

2. 3 third-country intelligence

staff officers in place in

Havana.

3. 2 third-country trained intel-

ligence officers, readied to

travel in Cuba for temporary

4. * Caribbean Admiesion Center,

Opa-Locka, Florida, fully

activated by 15 March 1962.

TOP SECRETSANDLIVE

L - 15 March 1962 (cont)

PURPOSE

To collect intelligence required for the

operations, to identify and earmark in-

telligence assets as refugees arrive,

and to provide security against Com-

munist agent operations.

5. * Periodic intelligence esti-

mates, as required by progress

of operations.

To up-date NIE 85-62, so that current

estimates can be considered at national

policy levels.

CONSIDERATIONS

This operation, in response to early recommendati on

as essential by the Chief of Operations, is moving at

utmost speed to become fully active by 15 March, with

a new building completed and occupied, and with a

staff of 43 at work. Operations commenced 15 February

and, as of 9 March, 33 people were active at the Center.

(CIA responsibility, with support by Defense, Justice,

State, USIA.)

As the operations develop, there will be both increased

intelligence collection and a need for as current an In -

telligence Estimate as the U.S. can produce meaningfully.

It is likely that a more informal method of producing an

Intelligence Estimate for use at the national level (than

now governing the issuance of NIE's) may have to be

followed. CLA is now publishing daily intelligence sum -

maries on Cuba and is planning a bi-monthly or weekly

report summing up intelligence for this purpose. (CLA

responsibility, with support of othere as required.)

8. Establish 2 additional third-

Cuba.

9. By 31 March, have 105 agents

selected and 50 agents trained.

Effectiveness and numbers are dependent upon purpose

of recruitment, nature of training, and policy decisions

controlling these factora. If the recruitment and train

ing are for resistance activities, the task of recruit-

ment and training will be much less difficult than if

they are limited to intelligence-collection purposes

10.* Develop intelligence potential

of Cuban "colonies" in U.S.

To exploit the intelligence possi-

bilities of former residents of

Cuba (including U.S. citizens) now

in the United States.

There are "colonies" in Washington, D.C., and other

U.S. cities which are "little Cubas." Family, Church,

and business interests provoke unusual personal ties

inside Cuba for some of these residente; a real potential

assets and to provide security

against Communist agent operations.

tary forces in Cuba.

releases on policy decision.

government and public, in

TOP SEC

RET SENSITIVE

PURPOSE

To overtly engage the U.S. prestige in sup-

port of a Cuban revolt to an extent that would

require the U.S. to become involved in assur-

ing the ultimate victory of a Cuban revolution;

this involvement must include the commitment

of U.S. military forces as necessary to achieve

such victory.

Indicate policy and commit prestige of U.S.

government to appropriate support of the

Cuban people vs. Communist dictatorship.

Commit national prestige and power of Latin

political, intellectual, labor, youth, religious,

military leaders to cause of Cuban people

against Communist regime. For local public

impact, international support, and morale of

resistance within Cuba.

CONSIDERATIONS

This political decision will require considera-

tion of the legal and moral factors, assessed

in the perspective of world opinion and U. S.

security interests.

Top officiale of Executive and Legislative

branches to make timely statements. This

should encourage similar attitude by leaders

of other nations and help spirit of Cubans.

Development of sympathy leading to favorable

opinion about outside support for Cuban people

is a goal.

Timely and strong public statements will be

encouraged. Maximum publicity at country of

origin, other key countries and into Cuba by

CLA assets. Support of State action by CLA and

USIA is involved.

PHASE II (Defense)

ACTIVITY

After political decision,

provide maximum U.S.

support to resistance fight-

ers in Cuba who have been

spotted in Phase I.

After political decision,

commit U.S. military forces

in accordance with contingency

plane.

TOP SECRET SENSITIVE

PURPOSE

To assure that Cuban "freedom-fighters"

are fully equipped to attack the Commun-

ist regime's military and police forces;

as part of the assurance, the U.S. support

must include the immediate commitment

of U.S. leadership personnel in combat

operations.

To intervene as required to achieve victory

for the revolutionary forces.

CONSIDERATIONS

DOD support planning, stock piling, readying of

equipment and personnel for commitment must

be developed with maximum lead time. Close

coordination with CIA is required to insure maxi-

mum readiness to meet the immediate needs of

the revolutionary forces. The hazard of visibility

in preparing for these support activities makes

security a paramount consideration.

Consistent with security aspect, U.S. military

forces are placed in a state of readiness to

accomplish the assigned mission. The military

forces must be prepared to assist in the mainte -

nance of order until the revolutionary government

is in control.

PURPOSE

To provide intelligence, guerrilla action, and

CONSIDERATIONS

CIA capabilities must be continuously assessed

ing the use of covert assets must be clearly

understood as resting in the U.S. military

TOP SEC

• SENSITIVE

March - July 1962

PURPOSE

Activities in consonance with U.S. policy

established after the April 196l failure in Cuba.

CONSIDERATIONS

These activities will have some negative impact

on the Cuban people, who are part of the target, but

are consistent with an overt policy of isolating Castro

and neutralizing his influence in the Western Hemis -

phere. They are noted here, for the sake of com

pleteness, as actions now being carried out by the

Department of State under other existing programs

and projects.

ACTIVITY

age of Cuba as required.

Develop the means of the Inter-

American Defense Board to pro-

vide substantive intelligence on

Cuban activities.

3. Provide logistic and personnel

support for CLA intelligence

operations into Cuba.

4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff will con-

tinue the planning and essential

preliminary actions to assure a

decisive U.S. military capability

for intervention.

TOP DE

March - July 1962

PURPOSE

To develop increased "hard" intelligence.

To add to the U.S. intelligence coverage

on Cuba and possibly to strengthen the

concern of Latin American states for

security.

To ensure optimum implementation of the

intelligence plan.

To overthrow the Communist government

of Cuba.

CONSIDERATIONS

Use of cays near Cuba entail unacceptable security

risks when vulnerable to Cuban landing parties.

(Defense, in collaboration with CIA.)

Sensitivity of using this multi-national organiza -

tion clearly restricte potential use by USA. Visi

bility of operational interest is an acceptable risk

here.

The intelligence plan requires support by U.S.

military manpower and equipment.

The U.S. military intervention must be conducted

as quickly as possible and with sufficient force

so that the Communist Bloc's ability to take

effective counter-measures is reduced to a

minimum.
