SAMUEL MANNARINO, aka

on 5/9/61, PG 612-C advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III as

follows:

The men operating the Mannarino-controlled horse room at

are being considerably

more careful in recent days than

1195 Fifth Ave, New Kensington, they have been heretofore.

Now they will not allow strangers in the horse room, and

they will not take a telephone wager unless they know the

caller by name or voice..

Gamblers in New Kensington predict a "lot of trouble" in

the forthcoming primary elections.

favors re-nomination of Incumbent Mayor RAYMOND GARDLOCK

and if the oposition group appears to have too good a

chance of defeating GARDLOCK they are expected to "pull

off something big.!

Perhaps they will attempt to switch

voting machines.

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
