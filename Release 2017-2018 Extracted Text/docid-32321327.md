The Honorable William J. Clinton

President of the United

States

Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. President:

For the reasons set forth in detail in the enclosure,

this letter requests that you exercise your authority, under

Section 9(d) of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination

Records Collection Act of 1992, to postpone the public disclosure

of three documents and a photograph ordered released by the

Assassination Records Review Board.

Consistent with the spirit of the Act, the Federal

Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has cooperated extensively with the

Board

and made the broadest disclosure of documents in the

Bureau's history.

In this instance, however, release of these

items would severely invade the privacy interests of three

private citizens

and subject them to public ridicule and

embarrassment with no discernable contribution to the public's

understanding of the circumstances surrounding President

Kennedy's assassination or how that crime was investigated by the

We are particularly concerned that the items, which have

been marked "OBSCENE" for good reason, may be published on the

Internet and will be available to minors following their release

to the public.

Moreover, we have been able to warn only one of

the three persons whose character and reputation will be

besmirched by the release of these items.

The one person we have

contacted strongly opposes the Board's decision to release this

material.
