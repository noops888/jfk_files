2. Memo for Record, 26 June 1967, by LRH,

same subjoct

b.

1. In my meting with the Department of Justice today, !

confirmed that

was our man. I outlined the pre-

liminary information we had developed on the transactiona between

him and one Lefty Rosenthal.

Z. Justice was advised that our information disclosed that

had passed sllencers and grenades to Rosenthal

daring July 1965, and that in October 1966 he had furnished pencila

and fuses. I also stated that it was our understanding that

was in contact with FDI/Miami and that it had been adviaed

of these dealings. Juitice was told that the iteme involved were not

of Agency origin. It was emphasised, however, that thie was our

preliminary conclusion and that we would undertake to verify it.

3. Justice acknowledged that FBI reporting disclosed

Jas its contact but appareitly the details are some -

what vague. To make a lederal case agalset Rosecthal because of his

suspected Involvement in the bombings, it will be necessary to show

that the Iteme used were obtained through interstate commerce. A

preliminary reading suggests prosecution under Title i8 Section 837.

Out of concera for the allegation of entrapment, Juniice asked that

we supply arora to the following: (a) did

volunteer tsal to the FBI or did 1& approach him initially:

(D). who intored the FBI of the July 1965 deal - the Agency or

(6) on what date was thie loformation given;

(d) cimilarly as regardo the October 1966 transaction, Che date

the laformation faraladed and by whom: (e) what were

ecrced for the items or their components; (1) were

these: sources within or without the State of Florida? And inel-

dentally were is aware khat supposedly

relined

a "profit" for furnihing the October 1966 leme and that he tried

without mccens to turn it into the "company" p While I agreed to

undertake to obtain the information requested, I suggested that

much of it might be readily avallable from the FBI. Justice con-

coded this and intenda to have further discusslona with 1l.

1. During the course of the meeting the interesting

hypothelo was eggested to the effect that

might have been "moonlighting" for Rosenthal, and only when he

began to leel to pressure did he start reporting to the Agency and

5. Under striclly controlled conditions with

Jacting an a conduis, Justice is considering the possibility

of assloting Rosenthal to obtain hie needed items, whereupon he

will be arrested imediately for possesalon. I told them while we

might be willing so have

so used we were under

etandably concerned over the adverse comment thai our employse' a

involvement could generate.

6. Os a ratter thas may be related: one Alhert LARRAIN

Maestro la alleged to have admitted to

that he had

been involved in the bombinge with Rosenthal and to have said more

explosives were sooded. LARRAIN Maestre is a luzitive under a

narcotics undiesmen: having formerly resided at 153 East 57th Street,

New York, New York. Do we have any information on this person?
