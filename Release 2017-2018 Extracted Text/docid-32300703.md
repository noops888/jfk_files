Re Pittsburgh letter

to Bureau dated January 22,

1958.

On February 5, 1958, PCI GOFFREDO CELLINÍ, who is

employed as Afternoon

Manager in the gambling casino at the

Hotel Nacional and whose identity must be concealed, advised

that he was well acquainted with both the subjects.

CELLINI

informed that many years ago when he was one of a gambling

group from Steubenville, Ohio, operating a club in thé West

Virginia area near the Pennsylvania border, the MANNARINo:

brothers tried to "muscle in" on the group but that their

attempt was unsuccessful.

He said that the MANNARINOS are

generally considered to control all the horse betting and

numbers

operations in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, and, Morgan-

town, West Virginia.

He informed that the MANNARINOs were

the money men behind NORMAN ROTHMAN, FBI #152585 B, during

the period 1951 and 1952 when ROTHMAN operated thé Sans;

Souci night club and gambling casino.

He said that ROTHMAN

was unable to make a success of this

operation and that altel

rosing considerable money, the MANNARINO brothers pulled out.

Source informed that he believed their interests. in this opera-

tion actually extended over a period of only about nine months.

Source further advised that he knew of no island owned

Pyg gambling interests or hoodlums off the coast of Florida near

Cuba.

He said that to his knowledge the MANNARINOs have had

no interest in Cuban gambling operations since they pulled out

of the Sans Souci.,

In this regard it should be noted that there are

only a few islands off the north coast of Cuba, and these

are generally considered to be uninhabitable because of lack

of water.

Islands farther to the forti

would comprise the

Florida Keys many of which

reason.

are uninhabitable for the same

2/6/58

On February 5, 1958, ARTED/NEWMAN, an old-time

gambler who works as a cáshier in the Hotel

Nacional gambling

casino, was contacted concerning the MANNARINO brothers,

and

he furnished substantially the same. normation as Pel CELLINI.

He said that the MANNARINOS and CHUCK

TEEMER formerly had been

the money men behind the Sans Souc; casino but that they pulled

out of the operation after NORMAN ROTHMAN was unable to make

it a financial success.

He stated emphatically that to his

knowledge none of these individuals have money interests in

gambling operations in Cuba at present.

Referenced Pittsburgh letter indicated that ROCCO

BUFFONE had been reported to be a cousin of the MANNARINO CUBA

brothers and an individual who fronted for them in one of

their enterprises.

A review of the incoming flight manifests on

February 3, 1958, reflected that an individual by the name

arrived in Havana at 1:42 P.M. on January

30, 1958, aboard Pan American Airways Flight 493 from Miami.

His destination was given as the Hotel Nacional.

Lavestigation is continuing in havana: (M)

Two extra copies of this letter have been prepared

for forwarding by the Bureau to Pittsburgh.
