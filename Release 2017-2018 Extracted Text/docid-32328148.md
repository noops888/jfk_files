money.

He stated that the bingo concession lost an average

average loss per month and they operated the concession in

the future for say $10,000 loss, they would in fact have

made $12,000 for the casino.

If bingo, for a given month,

would break even they would have made

$22,000 for the casino.

They also pointed out that they could keep attendance high

at bingo by offering door prizes, etc., and that the side

anted on
