Informant is presently living at the Hotel

Carlton, Room 1302, Pittsburgh, where he intends to

remain until the several cases

in which he is involved

are disposed of.

On 1/9/64, Informant and JOSEPH MEROLA contacted

SA JOHN S. PORTELLA

at the Pittsburgh, Pa. office, and

indicated that they desired to talk to SA JOHN S.

PORTELLA.

They suggested that SA PORTELLA come to Room 1302.

SA PORTELLA went to Room 1302, Carlton House

Hotel, where JOSEPH MEROLA was busy packing to return to

Miami, Florida on a

7:40 P.M. flight.

They both commented

hat they had workeo

on a business deal and earned a little

money but not enough to meet all their expenses.

JOSEPH MEROLA left the hotel for the airport,

leaving SA PORTELLA and informant alone.

SA PORTEILA noved that the informant was in ar

extremely good mood and appeared to be willing to talk

about matters that heretofore he refused to talk about.

Informant remarked that he desired to help "straighten

out" certain facts that the FBI might be interested in

provided he could be assured that he would not have to

testify in Federal Court or before any investigative or

administrative committees and that his name would not be used

nor made public in any way unless he first approved it.

Informant was told that any information he furnished would be

treated as confidential and no attempts would be made to force

him into testifying unless he first agreed to it. Informant

said that with this understanding he would be willing to

relate a few of his experiences and some of his knowledge of

what he termed "the outfit."

Informant remarked that he has been with "the outfit"

since he was 16 years old and has associated with this element

from coast to coast for the last 41 years. He claims that at

age 16 In Cleveland, Ohio, he began running "booze" for the

organization there.

who has faithfully carried out orders given him and, as a result

of this, he gained a reputation and stature throughout the

United States.

He claims that there is a tightly knit "gambling

syndicate" operating throughout the United States and member-

ship in it is not limited to Italians only.

He states that the

primary

requisite for membership is that one be engaged in

gambling, regardless of nationality. The italians have taken

over the

leadership of the gambling world and while they make

the big decisions in it, others such as Jews, Irish, Polish

and so forth are part of the operation.

The

Italians have

gone a step further than the others, in that members of their

respective families intermarried and this made the bond much

tighter.

Informant said that it is better to say that there is

a "gambling organization or syndicate" in which the Italians are

the leaders rather than to say that the Italians have a criminal

syndicate known as LA COSA NOSTRA or the MAFIA with the membarship 1

being exclusively Italian. He said that he knows from first

hand knowledge that the gambling syndicate looks down on crimes

of violence and crimes involving narcotics and prostitution.

Only in a few isolated

cases would the organization approve

such actions.

For example, he stated that JOHN LA ROCCA Of

Pittsburgh, is one of

the most peacful leaders in the

country.

"If someone inhis group steps out of bounds,

IA ROCCA will go out of his way to check the circumstances

and on more than one occasion has stopped hasty drastic

action that the others wanted to take, and the matter was

settled peacefully.

Informant stated that the gambling syndicate or

organization in Pittsburgh is set up as follows:

JOHN LA ROCCA and FRANK AMATO are the leaders or

bosses.

TONY RIPEPPI was a leader but he is retired and

has little or no voice. The next leader or sub-boss is

GABRIEL MANNARINO who is married to the daughter of FRANK

AMATO.

Below MANNARINO are the following who might be

called lieutenants:

JOE SICA

LOUIS VOLPE

JOE ROSA MICHAEL GENOVESE

Below the Ileutenants are the soldiers or workers namely,

AL ROSS, FRANK VALENTI, JOHN FONTANA, PHIL GENOVESE and

LOU MILANO (deceased).

CHARLES FREDERICK TEEMER, who operated the Jockey

club and now the Red Dog in Chester, W. Va., accounts only

to JOHN LA ROCCA who

gets 50 per cent of everything that

TEEMER has in operation no matter where he 1s.

JOE ROSA exerts control of YEE TERLESKI of

Pittsburgh's South Side, and he öbtains the lions share

of everything that TERLISKI has operating for him anywhere.

ROSA in turn contributes to JOHN LA ROCCA and accepts

orders from LA ROCCA.

JIMMY HOFFA, President of the Teamsters Union,

is acquainted with both JOHN LA ROKA and GABRIEL MANNARINO

and whenever HOFFA really wants

something In Pittsburgh

he calls on one of these two.'

JACK ARMAND, also known

as ARMANDO CARLOMAGNO, President of the Taxi Cab Union

of Pittsburgh, is flashy and loud

and gives everyone in

Pittsburgh the impression that he is HOFFA's contact in

Pittsburgh but actually this is not true.

By way of history of the setup in Pittsburgh,

informant related the following:

LA ROCCA succeeded JOHN BAZZANO, SR., who was

the undisputed leader of Pittsburgh.

BAZZANO, overwhelmed

with his importance, ordered the killing of the three

VOLPE brothers of Pittsburgh.

MIKE SPAMQLI (Phonetic)

carried out the execution of the VOLE boys.

'SPAMOLI

is allegedly in prison in Italy where he 1s serving a

life sentence for murder. Informant said this crime

was not

sanctioned by the organization and the killing

of more than one member of a particular family is

always looked upon with disfavor. The only two additional

• items that cause trouble in the organization are stealing

another member's wife and/or his money.

After the VOLPE killings, JOHN BAZZANO went

to New York to attend a banquet given in honor of

JOE MASSERIA (Phonetic), a big boss of the organization.

BAZZANO knew he was in trouble with everyone over the

VOLPE killings and when it came to his turn to make a

toast he asked those present what they were waiting

for and why they did not get his killing over with.

As soon as BAZZANO completed his comments each of the

32 men present stabbed him with an ice pick and his

dead body was shipped on to Pittsburgh.

According to the informant, this gave JOHN

LA ROCCA his chance and inspite of the informant's

opposition and the opposition of FRANK VAIENTI, LA ROCCA

gained solid control' in Fiüssburgh. As a result of their

copies Informant and VAliTy were branded as "outlaw

Since that time, they have had to live by

their wits and do not enjoy the wealth that the others

"in"

enjoy.

Informant said that he first met FRANK VALENTI

in Cleveland, Ohio, many years ago and it was VALENTI

who brought him to Pittsburgh and later introduced him to

the MANNARINOs of few Kensington.

Because of the fact that this was the first

time informant really began to open up, SA PORTELLA

chose not to make copious detailed notes and chose

not to ask detailed questions because he felt that to

do either of these things might cause the informant

to suddenly stop talking.

During the interview inforpant

touched upon the following items:

1.

TONY GROSSO of Pittsburgh is an incependent

numbers operator whose only ally is the Deputy

Superintendent of Pittsburgh Police Department

GROSSO is the biggest

book and/or bank in

Western Pennsylvania and

It is generally conceded that he supplies the

Pittsburgh Police Department, through MALONEY,

with information that they use to eliminate

competition for him. GROSSO has a current

girlfriend in the Greentree section of

Pittsburgh, whose husband drives a Pittsburgh

Post-Gazette or Pittsburgh Press newspaper

truck.

The husband is aware of GROSSO's

relationship with his wife and tolerates 1t.

He allegedly purchased

I for this girlfriend

a new 1963 Cadillac automobile.

GROSSO

has

been the topic of discussions many

times among the soldiers or workers.

Several

offers were extended to cause him trouble,

bUT. JOHN LA ROCCA VEtoed any of these moves

because he did not want trouble stirred up

in Pittsburgh.

2.

When informant ran the Bachelor's Club in

East Liberty for CHUCK TEEMER (in essence

FOr JOHN LAROCCA), he had complete contro

and recalled that for a two year period he

paid Deputy Superintendent LAWRENCE J.

MALONEY of the Pittsburgh Police Department,

$1,500 a week cash.

TONY RIPEPPI, once a besser leader, has been

permitted to

gracefully retire from ation

primarily beause of his three sons.

He has

no volce in problems now, but should he desire

an audience he could easily arrange one.

Use of dynamite or other explosives is striotly

against all organization current rules unless

It is approved by the leaders as the only way

to settle a dispute.

The reason for this

regulation is that too many innocent people

can be hurt and 1t attracts ailot of attention.

In the Pittsburgh area if anyone has a bank

roll and desires to get into some form of

gambling, he can automatically do so provided

he gets police protection.

If he goes along

fairly well someone from the organization will

try to become his partner but, before. the

approach is made, it will necessarily have to

be cleared with JOHN LA ROCCA and/or KELLY

MANNARINO. If they should approve the move,

the person desiring to cut in can make. :

his attempt.

But, if they deny authority

to make the approach, It would be best to

forget the whole thing. SONNY CIANCUTTTIOL.

New Kensington, Pa., 1s a close personal

friend of GABRIEL MANNARINO but holds no

official position in the group. When

CIANCUTTI: desired to become a partner of

BENNIE FROMME of Pittsburgh, 1t was okayed

by GABRIEL MANNARINO.

Informant helped

CIANCUTTI. but the alliance with FROMME

flopped because of the heavy losses.

JOSEPH.MEROLA, formerly of Pittsburgh and

now of Miami, is considered an outlaw.

MEROLA lost

favor with GABRIEL MANNARINO

and was never approved as a worker or

soldier.

SAM MANNARINO, New Kensington, Pa., has

no voice at either New Kensington or

Pittsburgh. His brother, GABRIEL, controls

the money and makes the decisions.

The dice and card game which operatea in

Braddock, Pa., until several months ago,

was managed by BENNIE PLOTKIN. This game

was a New Kensington operation bank rolled

by GABRIEL MANNARINO.

Meetings were held periodically by JOHN

LA ROCEA, FRANK AMATO, KELLY MANNARINO,

and others, but the meeting, date, and

place were

carefully guarded secrets and

hardly ever do they meet at the same place

twice.

NICK TWEEL of huntington, W. Va., Is very

friend that HOFFA and the Teamsters

considered to be the three leaders.

FATS, through his barbout gambling, owes the

Cleveland group about $500,000.

They put him in

business at the A Lounge and because of his gambling

it was forced to go out of business.

CHARLES MURGIE of Pittsburgh, Pa., was sent

to Youngstown, Ohio, to control MIKE FARAH who opened

the Jungle Inn.

This incident took place about 15 or

20 years ago and Pittsburgh and Cleveland agreed that

could handle the job in Youngstown, Onio,

because they desired to become MIKE FARAH's partner.

FArAh was making very good money at the Jungle inn and

the Pittsburgh - Cleveland group wanted 50 per cent

of the Jungle Inn to provide money for soldiers of

the Cleveland group who were serving a life sentence

as a result. of work they were doing for the organization.

The men serving the life sentence were as follows:

JOHNNY RAY

TOM LICAVOLI

RALPH CARSELLO

(FNU) ENGLISH of Toledo

JAKE SUKIN (Phonetic) of

Toledo

(Phonetic)

The wives of the men named above, for

as long

as 16 years, received monthly payments from the Cleveland

organization for as long as

their husbands were in prison.

This is one example of how the organization cares for its

faithful soldiers.

CAVBOMB

Informant stated that the killing of CHARLES

CAVALLARO is not related to other killings in Youngstown

such as NAPLES, DE NIRO, and so forth. He said that

there are many separate groups in Youngstown, Ohio, trying

to improve their position.

"Old outfit"

lost control

many years ago and even in the old days Youngstown was not

tightly supervised from either Cleveland or Pittsburgh.

Today Youngstown is up for "grabs" but all decisions

concerning Youngstown emanate from Cleveland.

VINCE DE NIRO: bankrolled

the Sang Souci

Club in Havanas, Cuba for EDDIE TOBIN and TOBIN took

him for $500, 000 cash. DE NIRO began to extend his

operations in numbers and gambling in Youngstown, Ohio,

in order to regain some of this lost cash and no one

seemed to interfere.

The NAPLES brothers also wanted

a piece

arranged for his murder. BILLY NAPLES, brother of

SANDY, learned that DE NIRO was responsible for his

brother's death and he, BILLY, personally wired up

DE NIRO's automobile which caused his death.

LOUIS DE NIRO was able to obtain the

proof that BILLY NAPLES killed his brother so he

arranged for BILLY NAPLES to be included on an

alleged big burglary score and as BILLY was getting

ready to participate on this score BILLY's car was

blown up.

Informant stated the record will show

that BILLY NAPLES was dressed in black clothing,

the type used by burglars in the Youngstown area.

At the present time, BILLY SUNDAY is

operating a barbout game in Struthers, Ohio. According

to informant, SUNDAY was once the partner of NICK DEDA

(Phonetic) of Buffalo, New York.

SUNDAY 1s operating

has been marked for a

his life will be taken in the very near future.

Informant has no idea who, when, and where it will

happen.

The only reasonshe could offer for the hit

is that

SUNDAY 1s operating without sanction, she he

refused to close, and he was close to CAVALIARO.

MIKE ROMEO, also known as MIKE ROMANO, of

Campbell,

Ohio, one of the old timers, was shot

at

The order for this came directly out of Cleveland

and is traceable, according to the informant, to JACK

WHITE and/or JOHN SCALISH.

He further pointed

out

that CAVALLARO testified before the KEFAUVER Crime

Committee Investigations of several years ago and

provided this committee with names, addresses, and a

few facts concerning the Youngstown-Cleveland

organization.

Since that time CAVALLARO has been

in disfavor and the attempted killing of ROMANO

presented a second

good reason for elininating

CAVALLARO.

Informant said he does not know who

actually did the technical work on CAVALLARO'S

automobile because there are so many who could

have done it.

He stated that there are so many

workers or soldiers in the Cleveland group that

he could not name or suspect one who might have

done the CAVALLARO work.

Informant said that he

would make some attempt

to learn

who actually

wired up CAVALLARO's automobile.

Informant said that he was well acquainted

with DOMINIC MOIA and knows that MOIA was not killed

because he wired up CAVALLARO's automobile, but was

killed on orders

eminating from Cleveland, Ohio,

the Cleveland group and then failed to deliver Canton.

Informant stated that from reliable sources

he knows that ALFRED OPONOWICZ, the Top Ten Fugitive

of the Bureau, is alive and believed to be

somewhere

in the South.

Informant said that he has ways of

determining just exactly where OPONOWICZ Is in the

South and he will obtain this address and telephone

number and make same available so that OPONOWICZ can

be apprehended. He stated that OPONOWICZ is not a

part of any organization or syndicate and for this

reason he would have no hesitancy in hasing them?

was sold.

From the enterprises listed above MASSI

earns approximately $7,500 per day without ever leaving

Miami Beach, Florida.

Informant said that MASSI Is probably one of

the most generous men in the racket-gambling element

in the United States. He said that MASSI, on a daily

basis, hands out over $500 in $20 bills to his old buddies

who did not do as well in the business

as he has done.

He stated that these handouts take place every morning

when MASSI goes to the barber shop for a shave.

Informant related that MASSI put MICKEY

LEIBOWITZ in business by giving him $27,000 cash to

buy a tavern in either

Cleveland or Miami.

On the

night LEIBOWITZ opened his tavern, MASSI spread the

word to his friends to pati mise MiSSIe club and on

opening night LEIBOWIIZ did $35,000 worth of business.

He tried to pay back the

_$27,000 and MASSI refused

to accept it.

Informant stated that MASSI is definitely

worth several million dollars and is married

to a Jew.
