I reported that Max Gonzales, a court clerk,

said that he witnessed

meetings at New Orleans' Lakefront Alrport in "either June or

July" of 1963 between Edgar Eugene Bradley of North Hollywood,

California, and the late David W. Ferrie.

The artlole reports

that Garrison 1s attempting to extradite Edgar Eugene Bradley

on conspiracy charges. Garrison reportedly stated that the

allegations of Gonzales coincide with those he made in an

affidavit included among papers seeking Bradley's extradition

to New Orleans.

A check of Bureau files revealed one reference to

the name Max Gonzales which might be identical with the Max

Gonzales mentioned in the above newspaper article. This file

reference reveals that in February, 1965, former New Orleans

criminal informant, NO-1227-C-TE, who had ties with hoodlum

and vice personalities in New Orleans, was arrested by

New Orleans police officors and investigators from the Orleans

Parish District Attorney's Olfice and was charged with pandering.

On Harch 18, 1965,

this criminal informant told the New Orleans

office that he had been contacted by a Max Gonzales of the

Orleans Parish District Attorney's Office and was advised that

the District Attorney'g Office had a good case against the

informant and for $2,000 1t would be dropped.

We have previously reported that Garrison may have had

the wrong Bradley arrested and that instead of Edgar Eugene

Bradley the individual Garrison is Interested in is Leslie Norman

The latter individual is a former airline pilot who

has described himself as a "soldier of fortune."

In August, 1960,

Leslle Norman Bradley was sentenced to a ten-year prison term in

Cuba on a charge that he took part in a plot against the Castro

rogime. Leslie Norman Bradley was released from a Cuban prison
