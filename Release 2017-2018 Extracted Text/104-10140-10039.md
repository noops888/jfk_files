10. (Unclassified - PLC) LIAISON Together with Bruce Johnson,

DDA, Dick Rininger, OGC, and Shep Shepanek, O/SA/DO/O, met with

Cary Cornwell, Deputy Staff Chief, and Michael Goldsmith, staff of the

House Select Committee on Assassinations, and discussed proposed

revised procedures for the staff of the Committee to review CIA unsanitized

documents. (See Memo for the Record.)

11. (Unclassified - JMD) LIAISON Called Jack Ticer, Clerk,

Senate Armed Services Committee, and advised him that the Director will

not have to leave the hearing early tomorrow after all, that he will be able

to stay if the hearing goes to 1:00 p.m. or later. Ticer said they will not

know until after the hearing gets well underway whether they will be able

to wind it up at 1:00 p.m. or have to break and come back for an afternoon

session.

12. (Unclassified - JMD) LIAISON Called Judy, in the office of

Representative John Dingell (D., Mich.), and made an appointment for the

Director to meet with Mr. Dingell at 1:15 p.m. tomorrow regarding the

Congressman's letter of 20 January on NUMEC. I explained to Judy that

the Director would be in a briefing on the Hill and that should end by 1:00

but that if I found he was going to be detained longer, I would let her know

and we could change the time. She said this would be fine.

13. (Unclassified - JMD) LIAISON Phyliss Bacon, Senate Armed

Services Committee staff, called and asked about the 5 January 1978

transcript of the Agency briefing of the Legislation Subcommittee. She said

she had the transcript which is stamped Top Secret. She asked if we were

to retain this transcript and also whether we had seen the transcript. I

told her I was not sure on either of these points but I would check and get

back to her. She said she also wanted to reaffirm that OLC has complete

control of all the Committee transcripts of our briefings. I assured her

they were retained in this Office and that no one was allowed to take them

out of the Office unless Mr. Cary or Mr. Millergave their permission. She

said that was fine, and that she would put this in/their "guidelines" which

she is writing now.
