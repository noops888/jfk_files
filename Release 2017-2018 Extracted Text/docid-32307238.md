had been given to one

LEVINE, who fronted for the concession during

the 1952-53 winter season.

This office was never successful in definitely

establishing who put up the money for the operation although there was a

definite tie-in between it and the Sans Souci night club.

LEVINE is

believed to be out of Miami

He resided at the Hotel Comodoro in Havana

during the past season.

advised approval from government authorities had been

obtained

. to set up a gambling operation at the Havana Greyhound Kennel

Club, the only dog track in Cuba, He said that the past week CHARGES F.

"CHUCK" PEMER, who fronted for the Mannarino interests at the Sans Souci

DATE 5/

in Havana several years ago, had been in town to study the possibilities

of setting up the operation at the dog track.

Due to a clause in the

contract between the owners

of the dog track property and the operators to

the effect that no gambling other than the regular pari-mutual betting will

be allowed on the property,

said that the setting up of the

operation is stymied at the

present.

He explained that the owners of the

dog track property also own the Casino Nacional which they hope to rent

al to some one for the coming winter season. Since the dog track and the

casino are located only a ghort distance apart, the ones of the properle

do not wishoto prejudice their chances

of renting the Casino by permitting

simbling to optate at the dog track.
