INTRODUCTION

FEDERAL INTELLIGE:CE AGENCILS AND THE KENNEDY ASSASSIGATIGN

Even before she cloclosuces of the last three montlis, there wece ample

rcasons for an invesilgacion of improper activities by the ClA and the fol in are

case of Loe Hurvey Oscald, and of the exient of the cooperation between chese

agencies and the Watzen Comilssion.

After the

assassisacion, allegacions were promptly made chat. Oswald had beer

an informant or employee of some incelligence agency. Sand Chat cherefore che

Secret Service had not been warned about hin). Even though the Warren Cornission

cook these repocta very seriously, It failed to properly investigate either this

specific charge or the exact nature of the relationships betueen Oswald and chie

Chl, the FBl, and nilicacy incclligence. "

The bulk of the Cornission's Investigation was done through various federal

agencies, notably the eel.

Thus these agencies were in large part responsible

foc the coverup of auch of what the Commission was supposed to be reporting for

the Arcerican people. It is clear, for example, that the FBI nisled the larren

Cornission ábout the extent of les files on Oswald, and also in other ways dis-

couraged the Conlosión from exonining the implications of sone of the Burcau's

Intelligence-gathering. rethods - c.&., the incerception of several of Oswald's

letcers to left-wing political groups. Hoover sidetracked the Connission's

Investigacion of the allegation that Oswald had been an

FBi informant, and henc

chrough semantic contorcions to deny the face that Jack Kuby had apparently been

a Potential Criminal Informant for the FBI.

B..

THE UIILITY OF A STUDY OF TIE RECONDS

"The Oswald case provides an unusual opportunity, to check the practices and.

records of one intelligence agency against the files kept by other agencies. *

Breat deal of infornation has been published by the Warren Conission, made

avallable in che lacional Archives, or preserved there but not released. - This

Includes the purportedly complete files on Oswald of the CIA, the Staïe Departmacto)

and the Defense Depacient (including the Office of daval Intelligence), as vell

as a list of the FBI Headquarters file, There is, however, evidence that chose

files are not complete, and suggestions that sensitive or improper activities,

donestic and foreign, were not fülly recorded in the appropriate

files. An

analysis of the flou of records in this case could provide a "control" stuly

•u:eful in other cases. This would he particularly helpful if credible allesations

os improper CIa activicles are not supported by the records nade available in

"ie investigatino comictees.

It seeas atypical that the contemporary firi report gives no indicacion of

the oriola of chac informarton; that oblesion may indicate a particulaily

sensitive source.

The recencly disclosed CIA projece of "selective" intesception

cholmed that this proctaa was in operacion in 1960 in only one city.

It 1s also quite possible chat the fui got lis information about fils privace

CIA NITENTION IO CHALD'S POLITICAL ACTIVITIES

In shé sunner of 296s; Osuald engaged in various Local pollaical accivicigipesiting

In New Orleans on behalf of the fate Play for Cuba Connittee.

He. distributed

Ilcerature on the street several times, once being urrested after getcing into

"Furids Transmieted to Residents of Russia," including four after his return. ta

CIA actention to domestle dissent, that the FBI also sent the CIn a repor:

entitled "Fall Play for Cuba Corniccee - New Orleans Virision." In fact, this

report dealt only with Osuald and "A: J. Hidell," later decerained to be his.

allas.

An acterpe should be made to understand the dissemination of that repore

inside the Agency - that is, to see whether it was probassed not only as a report

on Oswald but is

a repore on a politically active croup.

That might lead to a

better understanding of the Cli's handling of such information on other groups.

It' should be determined lE any Clu personnel (emplayees of inforcanes) were

aware of Oswold's activities in New Orleans. The Warren lepost says that the

respeccively. This is in itself of no parcicular significance in

conneccion with

the assassination, but an explanation may shed sone light on the CIA's file-building

procedures.

THS SAd CAP STREET CONVECTION

•The nost provocative link betueen Oswald's activities in few. Ocleans and

Tine CIa is his use of thé address 544 Cana Street on some of his pro-Casero

licerature. One office in that building had previously been occupied by one of

the cho principal offices of the Cuban Revolutionaty Council, a front organization

established by.the. Cld (reportedly through E. Howard lunt) in connection with

the Bay. of Pigs invasion.

It is apparently true, as the Warren Report noted, ll

that the CRC had Left 544 Cano Street

sore cine earlier, and that Oswald himself

never actually

rented an office there.

However, at the time of the assassination;

another office at Sit Camp was occupied by Guy Banister, a former FBI agent who

was still active in irtelligence work, especially Cuban actlvicles..

The Banister

connection was never pursued by the Warren Cornission.

The 544 Camp connection was extensively publicized at the time of Jim

Garrison's "investigacion."" Numerous reports surfaced

of witnesses who could

lin's Osuald wich David ferrie and others who hung around Banister's office.

Unfortunately many de these reports cone fros sources who must be considered

unreliable, und to night have had reasons of their own for exaggerating this linke

. The nost promising source of hard evidence on this matter would be a close study

of the pre-assassination FBI and CId records.

From a docurent not given to the barren commission but relcased to me under

the Freedon of Information Act, it can be firaly established that the EBI knew

before the assassination aboni Osvald's use of Sár Canp Street as.

an address for

rhe Fair Play for Cuba Conittee.

This fact vas not pentioned in the appropziate

conterporancous reports, and nos apparently not checked out at the cine, ever

evaluate the specific sicuations in which oswald night have been approached by

the CIA.. One obulous possibility was on his return from kussia. From the

The extent of the CIA's routine coverage of people returning from Pussia is not

known, but it was extensive enough to net a photograph taken by a tourist. in

Minsk which (after the assassination) was found to show Oswald. The question

is, therefore, not just whether the Cla ever contacied Oswald, but if not why not

In 1962, Oswald prepared (and. had typed) a manuscript about his life in

ALLECCO PHOTO DE HUNT AND STURGIS IN DALLIS

The Rockefeller Cassission ls reportedly chiecking out and scbutting the

..allegation that E. Howard 'furt and Frank Sturgis (also known as Florini) appear

Lenedlately after the assassination. These pliorographs represent an authentio

unzesolved myster, it is crue; however, the men pictured have been

"positively

Identified" on previous, oscasions; as other "suspects" in the assassinations.

Aside fron the absence of any striking similority in appearance, it is

inherently most unlikalj that a professional intelligence operative like Hunt

(ino got a wig just so intervlew Dita Beard) sould get himsele photographed

without a disguise at the scene of an assassination if he had anyching co do

wich it.

While such allegacions should be seriously checked out, they should not be

allowed to distract ascention from more plausible but less spectacular evidence

of improper CIA activities in connection with Oskald or the assassination

investigation. To allos chut to happen would be to invite disinformation effores

by the Agency and its friends.

the Warren Connission.' Whatever O'Neal's quact statement about che Cla file was,

it seens clear that the CIA did rot want to linediately reveal to the Ell che

A. THE WARREN CONNISSIQN

The CIA apparently never volunteered

to the Warren Commission any infor

That link should have been established
