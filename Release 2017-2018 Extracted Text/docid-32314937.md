the fact that he, CACIOPPO, believed

that over the years he has not received his fair share of

the income from the organized criminal element in KCMO.

CIVELLA indicated to him that he had received his fair

share and was still receiving it, but the only reason he

had no tangible assets in property, etc., was b√©cause he.

had lost his money gambling.

was considering selling his

home and leaving the Kansas

at Reno, Nevada, at the Riverside Hotel from 6-13-62 to

6-15-62.

On 7=13-62, Major JOHN. FLAVIN, KCMOPD, advised

that officers had checked out CHUCKY MORGAN recently in

the vicinity of subject's residence, and CHUCKY at that

time indicated he had been checking

the house periodically

because subject was out of town on vacation in Buffalo,

subject has been in Las Vegas for the past four days. Ill-
