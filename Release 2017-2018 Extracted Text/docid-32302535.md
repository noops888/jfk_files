GABRIEL MANNARINO, aka;

AR

SAMUEL MANNARINO, aka;

AR

on 6/1/61, PC 615-C advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH III:

Activity at the various gambling establishments in New

Kensington, Pa., continues unusually slow as it has since

the defeat of Mayor RAYMOND GARDLOCK in the primary

elections

of 5/16/31. Many of GABRIEL MANNARINO's "small fry"

employees

are complaining because in general their incomes

are based on commissions from the volume of gambling receipts.

Even the "after hours" drinking establishments are doing

very little business

GABRIEL MANNARINO' eldest daughter, GEORGIENNE, IS to

graduate from New Kensington High School on 6/7/61. It is

expected that she will receive many handsome gifts, includ-

ing an automobile from her father.

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
