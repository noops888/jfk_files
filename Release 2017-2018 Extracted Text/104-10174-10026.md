In Fe LICOCKY/1

As I have mentioned on no vi us occasions (both here andin wash)

-I have bao-fe iporarsinaly concarned bout the LICoOkY -prblem..

For the past trelve months she has rather persistently. "hinded"

us to get together to talk about "mutual concerns"; and I have

studiously avoidrd her upon advice from Stition personnel. Even

1f the station hed not advised me to seer clearof her, I gritx

would have done so because of the continuing rum's I hear fmm

various sourcest the effect that she is a paid agent of the us

gout. In referring to an invitation he got for li a atttittaro

short time ago, Xirau mentioned that he has heard she 1s a dauble

arant, while In en york Margery Urquial(site of ictor Urquld1)

flatly told me that ate 1s working for the corporation. Last

Spring, while I was visiting in Valle del Brazo, a former TIME

correspondent (Dudly Dust) mentioned in the presence of

some Mexican Intellectuals that site wis probably a agent. Eunice

Odio once told me that almost everyone knows that she is-employed

by the cor pation. The, to l've heard Ponce mention that GINLUCK,)o

(une guad ode has veani), te set the money from uncle sam, and

he referred to this frienship with sit ll on nother occasions

I've heard other references to L/l---enough to make me a bit

apprehensive about her possibly blowing the worke.

SUGGESTION: GET HER CUB OF MEXICO BEFORE SHE

BLOS /HE WORKS either disctl6 or indirectly
