AVWHIP/1 stated further that AVLASH had decided that he should

like to have the meeting in Rome and that it should take place

sometime before the ind of January (since it is now known that

AMBIDDY intends to go to Europe during the first part of the

week of the 18th, Its quite possible the meeting will take

place during the week of the l8th.

ANHIP said that he would

not have an unlimited amount of time this time to be in Europe.

We sald we understood this and told AWNHIP that "Nick" (N.

Sanchez) Ilkewise could only devote 3 or 4 days to European

meetings. It was agreed, therefore, that for the best

utilization of both men's time, they should coordinate their

travels to Europe.

3. Silencer: ANWHIP opened this subject by saying that

he wanted to get something off his mind even though he was

aware that we were always reluctant to discuss this subject.

He stated that he would be able to get a silencer for a

that he understood our position on this point. he then pro-

ceeded on the other subjects.

4. AlLASH'3: In response to a request from WHI'SA'CI

(Tansing) we brought up the subject of ANLASH'3. In summary,

ANWHIP did not have anything to add to his ploture of ALASH 3

that he has not already discussed previously with N. Sanchez.

However, for the

record so will Include a sumary of our con-

versations concerniny AlLiSH '3.

AMLASH '3 for many years,

(since school days) but did not

consider him to be a close friend. He knew ASLASH '3's

family as he had sold jewelry to them from time to time

during the Batista era in Havana. AWHIP'I believed

AMLASH'3 had been associated with the University but had

not actually been a bonafied student. He knew nothing

else about AJLASH'3's educational background. AMLASH'3

had known kaif 1 for 10 or 12 years. It was the opinion

01 ASWHIP L that ALASH '3 was "100% loyal to AmMe,"

"It further stated that aside frow his rather strong interest

in liquor and attendant belligerency when drunk, AMLASH'3

was not open to corruption through financial inducement

or other material rewards. He stated that AMLASH 3 "*s VIng

ready rather involved with Ahip", and his plotting, aad

acted as driver.

sated that he had given this information to, he belleved,

both "Nick" and to Growery in Europe. He knew the man who

had recruited Blanco in Cuba as being a notorious DSI

operator. He could not recall the use but stated he had

provided it before on a previous occasion. He did not

know any of the details of AlLISH 3's activation in Madrid

or of his contact with Luis Manuel CANTILLO TOROIC. ANWHIP

¿ sald be as avare fit only of the fact that ALASH's had

" been in the company off"Luis Manuel". AWHIP I, however,

offered to ellelt as much information as possible about the

AMLASH '3 'CANTILLO relationship. He asked for a briefing or

& list of questions prior to his next meeting with AMLASH'3

in Europe.

In discussing the loyalties of AULASH 3 and the re-

sultant security implications for the AMLASH operation,

ANWHIP stated (see above) that he vas absolutely certain

that AMLASH 3 would never intentionally reveal any thing

to anyone which would jeopardize AULASH 1. (Case Officer

Comment: In discussing Security ramifications of AMLASH '3's

knowledge of the AMLASH I AMBIDDY relationship, beth in the

light of his DSI assocttions, It could be concluded that since

AMBIDDY is now tied closely to ANLASH 1, AULASH 3 will also

protect ANBIDDY.)

During the discussion of ANLASH 3, MWHIP 1 expressed

mild amazoment over the fact that we continued to doubt A 3'g

bonassdes when MASH 1, who had lu head ise cdoblack, had

enough confidence in the man to includo him tres sone of his

most compromising actlrities.
