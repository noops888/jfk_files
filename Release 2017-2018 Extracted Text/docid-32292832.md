FOLLOWING COMMENT/IS MADE CONCERNING INFORMATION REQUESTED

RECGTEL

IN REBUTE

IT IS POINTED OUT THAT THE MATTER OF SUBJECT'S PRESENCE

IN MEXICO IS SOMEWHAT DELICATE SINCE IT CAN BE ASSUMED THAT

THERE WERE PAYOFFS AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT

INVOLVED IN SUBJECTS PRESENCE IN MEXICO FOR SO MANY YEARS.

IT CAN BE CONJECTURED THAT THIS ARRANGEMENT CAME APART FOR

UNKNOWN REASONS LEADING TO SUBJECT'S EXPULSION. ANY INVESTIGATIONU

TO SPECIFICALLY RESOLVE THIS WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO OUR OPERATIONS

AND PROBABLY FUTILE C

THE HEAD OF INSPECTION SERVICE OF MEXICAN IMMIGRATION

ADVISES GIANCANA WAS ESPELLED AS AN UNDESIRABLE ALIEN, A SUMMARY

PROCESS UNDER MEXICAN LAW•

ACTUALLY SUBJECT HAD BEEN ON MEXICANCEY US

PART OF SUBJECT IN MEXICO AND DO NOT CONSIDER THAT HE WOULD

HAVE RISKED HIS POSITION IN MEXICO BY ANY SUCH ACTIVITY. *S

4. THERE IS NO INDICATION OF ANY FURTHER ACTIONS CONCERNING

THE SUBJECT ON THE PART OF MEXICAN AUTHORITIES.

THERE ARE NO KNOWN BANK ACCOUNTS OR SAFE DEPOSIT BOXES

RELATED TO SUBJECT IN MEXICO, AS FAR AS IS KNOWN, ALL HIS

TRANSACTIONS IN MEXICO WERE HANDLED THROUGH HIS ATTORNEY JORGE

CASTILLO. ANY BANKING INFORMATION WOULD BE CONFIDENTIAL. HE

WOULD HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN RENTING SAFE DEPOSIT BOXES UNDER
