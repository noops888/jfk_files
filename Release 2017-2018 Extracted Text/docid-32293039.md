My enclosed memorandum to you dated 4/28/61 reported Aram

Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) con-

Co ho dừ372960

cerning situation wherein Marcello, notorious New Orleans hoodlum,

subsequently revialed to be false. No comment was made by Liaison

Representative when, during conversation,

Wack said he feels one

Bureau informant in this matter because Kilby

went to Guatemala in 1956 with Carl Irvingxwoll. (Noll has admitted

being involved In fabricating Marcello 3 birth"record in 1956.)

Regarding Wack's suggestion, Kilby is our informant as to false

birth record Director asked "Is he? H."

Kilby is not Bureau

informant in this matter Our

informant is

associate of Marcello and an

informant of New Orleans Division.

Only reference to Kilby in

Bureau files reflects that when we interviewed him on 5/29/58 he

told us he never associated with Noll; that he knew Noll made

trips to Guatemala; and that they talked about selling slot machines

there.

Kilby also said that when he knew Noll, he heard discussions

and rumors regarding acquisition of Guatemalan citizenship by
