For the Director's inforation

there is attached a memorandu

which summarizes the results of our investigations of anti-Castro raids

and contemplated raids, as received through 3/31/63.

We have obtained complete resumes on the 3/26/63 raid

carried out by 1i-66 on the soviet ship from some of the participants

and have learned both boats used in the raid had been docked previously

at North Miami Beach. One leader states the bomb used was made up

in the Bahamas from material taken from the U. S.(and he also states

other arms used were provided hy CIA prior to the April, 1961, invasion

of Cuba and were subsequently hidden at various locations in the

(u]

Bahamas Those interviewed

positively denied any U. s. assistance

or support for the raid.
