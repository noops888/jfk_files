SUBJECT: Lee Harvey Oswald Case: Briefing of Congressman

Richard Ichord,

8

May

1972

1. Mr. Joseph O'Neill, Office of the Legislative

Counsel, presented Mr. Arthur Dooley, who furnished the

requested by

the Congressman, and answered his

questions

as follows:

2. Mr. Ichord said he was concerned over one aspect

of the

the standpoint of his

committee. He wanted to know if "during CIA's investigation

of Oswald when he was in Mexico" we developed any evidence

of a conspiratorial relationship between the Soviets and

Oswaldeither through our coverage of the Emhassy or

outside meetings. He specifically referred to soviet

consular officials Pavel Antonovich Yatskov and Valeriy

Vladimirovich Kostikov, one or both of whom Oswald

contacted at the Soviet Embassy. (Both Yatskov and

Kos tikov

were identified in the Commission's Report as consular

officials and KGB

did

representatives.) I told him that CIA

not have Oswald under investigation when he was in

Mexico City; directed his attention to the pertinent

exhibit; and explained that the KGB affiliations of the

two soviets were supplied by CIA experts who were aware

of their activities and not by anything said or indicated

by Oswald in the evidence compiled by us. Mr. Ichord

examined the exhibit,

noted that Oswald's short conversations

only related to securing visas; indicated that he had been

misinformed; and said that he had no further questions to

ask on this point.

3. He said that his question was sparked by Bernard

Fensterwald, Jr. a former constituent, about whon he

knew very little when he reauested

the documents. Since

then he has learned of Fensterwald's dubious credentials

as an expert on the assassination and of his association

with Jim Garrisson and others of questionable repute.

I detailed our own difficulties with

Fensterwald, his

insistence that ve are hiding something, and how, as

Executive Director of the Committee to Investigate

Assassinations, he has been pressing us to release

classified documents under threat of invoking the

Freedom of Information Act.

rundown on how CIA learned of Oswald's presence in

Mexico,

and the circumstances surrounding the photo of the

unknown man which was taken in front of the Soviet Embassy.

I specified

refuted the assorted allegations regarding

i Care one and Tato mare ten enor tell Lane ,

Jim Garrisson,

and later Bernard Fenstervald,

nentioned that tensterwald told us a vear aro that h

knew

the identity of the unknown man but so far has no:

volunteered his name. One of Garrisson's charges was that

Oswald

was

a CIA agent and that we cut him out of the

picture. I took the occasion to stress that Oswald was

not a CIA agent and that we never had anything to do with

him.

5. I mentioned that when the President's Commission

came into existence Mr.

Helms issued specific instructions

to cooperate fully with the Commission and to give it

complete access to any information bearing

on the assassina-

tion; that Commission members, at Mr. Helm's invitation

visited our Mexico City station for an on-the-scene

briefing and inspection. I told him

that we have not

released

exhibits relating to Oswald's visits to the

Soviet

and Cuban Embassies, because the sources of the above

information are extremely sensitive and

still productive.

Mr. Ichord fully agreed on this score and complimented us

on the extent of our coverage.

f. Mr. Ichord asked what steps CIA was taking to

declassify its other documents. I told him of the required

five year cycle (one coming un

shortly), the review

process, our interim releases,

and CIN's desire to release

as quickly as the need for protecting them subsides.

I pointed out that most of our material consists of "nut

complaints", rumors, gossip, etc; which have no security

significance per se

but could be embarassing to innocent

persons; disclose a productive and friendly foreign source;

or acknowledge CIA's presence abroad where diplomatically

this would be inadvisable. I

cited our experience with the

"crank call" that originated in I

how

in 1968 we tried to declassify this exhibit but

security officials objected on the grounds that it would

publicly acknowledge CIA presence on their soil and perhaps

stir unwarranted controversy. I stated that despite the

above-type problems we gradually have been declassifying

CIA's material, sanitizing exhibits, as necessary to

protect our sources

and methods.

7. I mentioned in passing, that two other things

beyond our control have contributed to the misconceptions

over our exhibits:

A)The inadvertent release by National

Archives of the master list of numbered exhibits

shortly

after the demise of the President's Commission without

distinguishing between overt and classified items; and

B) the fact that many exhibits bear different numbers

but are interrelated, thus giving a false impression that

there are more exhibits than is the case.

The release

of the master list without the accompanying documents

until we declassified the document a couple of years ago.

8. Mr. Ichord asked if any CIA members served on

the President's Commission. I said no, but mentioned that

former DCI Allen Dulles was on the Commission. He then

turned to the makeup of the Commission staff and how it

was chosen. I replied that we were not really competent

to comment

on how it was chosen but the staff consisted

largely of attorneys of varied political and ethnical

backgrounds from widely separated parts of the country;

that,

from my observation, the Commission was impressively

organized and a highly motivated, hard working group.

9. Mr. Ichord stated that he had no further questions

to ask and thanked us for easing his mind. We offered to

produce any other documents he might wish

to see. Mr. Ichord

replied that this would not be necessary. He returned our

exhibits and told us to consider the matter closed.
