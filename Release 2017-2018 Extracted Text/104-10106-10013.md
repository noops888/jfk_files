SUBJECT: Intelligence Sources and Methods

1. The principle of protection and intelligence sources and

methods is central to the viability of clandestine operations. The

inability to protect intelligence sources and methods will be de-

structive of the credibility of the Agency in dealing with its

clandestine assets, and in dealing with intelligence services around

the world to whom our security is already a matter of grave concern.

2.

oust the Castro regime.

forever badly conceived different paris of the

program, and whatever the chances of success, the fact is that the

• ultimate objectives met the highest standards of American ideals.

There were a lot of Cubans who worked with the Americans to

free Cuba. They carried their plans to desperate extremes, risking

their lives at the Bay of Pigs and in hundreds of smaller incursions.

Some were associated with scheming to assassinate Castro himself. Some

did this on their own as patriots and some, also as patriots, did it

with the support of representatives of the United States Government.

Right or wrong the identity of those people constitute a trust of the

American Government. If betrayed it would be a breach of honor and a

demonstration to our allies today, and to those individuals around the

world who work with us, that they must review the risk they take in our

association.

4. Ine protection of intelligence sources is more than a dry legal

phiase.

Our letter to the Attorney General of 14 October 1976

forwarded all information from Agency files responsive to

these questions which we judged could be forwarded to the

Dade County police without jeopardizing sources or methods,

provided the Attorney General found that the Agency could

legally do so.

A second point, also to follow from the

Attorney General's findings was that, even if such informa-

tion could legally be provided, a determination would have

to be made within the Agency whether some of the requested

information which related to former or current agents of the

Agency might still require protection. Your marginal comment

asks whether we are not straining the concept of protection

of sources

we protect those who are not now intelligence

sources and whether we are protecting them from prosecution

for terrorist activity today.

After referent memorandum was sent to you, the Attorney

General refined an earlier opinion from former

Assistant

Attorney General Antonin Scalia.

The Department of Justice

now concludes that, to the extent Agency information either

does not involve U.S. persons or falls within one of seven

exceptions to the general prohibition against collection of

information concerning the domestic activities of U.S. persons,

such information can be provided to local police authorities.

It is significant, however, that the Attorney General in his

23 March letter to you (Attachment B) expressly included the

following language:

In addition to the facts above, the Office of

Legal Counsel has pointed out that Executive Order

11905

does not require CIA to respond to Dade County.

Indeed,

the responsibility of the Director of Central

Intelligence to protect sources and methods of intelli-

gence, established by statute, 50 U.s.C. #403(g),

and E.O. 11905, Section 3(d) (vii), is authority for

him to withhold such information from local lav

enforcement officials if he believes its disclosure

would threaten the security of intelligence sources

or methods.

In the light of the Attorney General's opinion, those

offies holding

the relevant files

are now reviewing

confirm that the information originally selected for passage

to Dade

County law enforcement officials is responsive and

complete.
