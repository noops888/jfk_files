FIDEL CASTRO'S SPEECH:

Castro's two-hour speech on 23 November was what he termed

an "objective analysis" of the implications of President

Kennedy's assassination.

The speech reflected an appre-

hension

that US

policy toward Cuba may now become even

tougher.

He said the President's death was "serious and

bad news" and sought to insinuate that "ultrareactionaries"

in the US are exploiting the assassination--and may have

been responsible

for it--as part of their campaign for a

more "aggressive" US policy against Cuba. (Page 1)

MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS:

The Cuban defensive military alert,

FIDEL CASTRO'S SPEECH:

Fidel Castro's two-hour speech on 23 November was what

he termed an "objective analysis" of the implications of

President Kennedy's assassination.

The speech reflected an

apprehension that US policy toward him may now

become even

tougher.

He said the President's death was "serious and bad

news" which could lead from "a bad situation to a worse situ-

ation." He pointed out that President Kennedy's alleged

promise not to invade Cuba had been strongly attacked by those

"ultrareactionaries" in the United States who, he said

using the assassination to create a climate of "anti-

Soviet, anti-Cuban hysteria" designed to pressure the new

President toward a Cuban policy "highly prejudicial to the

interests of peace and of mankind."

castro began his speech by stating that he "and the

Immense majority of human beings" react with "repudiation" to

the assassination,

which is not "a correct method of struggle."

While the death of the imperialist system would make Cubans

happy,

"the death of a man, even if that man were our enemy,

cannot make us happy...we must not confuse the systems with

the men."

He said,"we always cease our belligerency at death;

we always bow with

respect at death, even if it has to do

with

an enemy."

Castro declared that the assassination can only benefit

"those ultrarightist and ultrareactionary sectors, among which

President Kennedy could not be counted."

These "most reaction-

ary forces are now breaking loose within the United States,"

he declared. President Kennedy was a strong president who

was able to control these pressures, but the

new US president,

because of the circumstances inherent in his assumption of

the presidency, will not have the same strength and authority,

Castro said.

Castro then read a series of US news dispatches referring

to the Castro-Communist affiliations of the accused assassin.

He said this was all part of the "reactionary" effort

create a climate

of "anti-Soviet, anti-Cuban

hysteria" in

the United States.

This climate

of hysteria, he said, is

designed to face the new President with an irresistible pres-

sure toward a "more aggressive policy."

Castro then devoted considerable

time in an attempt to

throw doubt on the guilt of the accused assassin and to in-

sinuate that Oswald, whether guilty or innocent, was actually

a tool of the extreme rightists.

"Is he really guilty? Is

he a scapegoat?

Is he a psychopath? Or is he perhaps a tool

of the most reactionary US circles? Who is this man?

FIDEL CASTRO'S SPEECH - cont'd

Why did he go into action precisely when circumstances were

least favorable for a left-wing fanatic to assassinate the

US President?" Castro stated that his investigation of the

"reports,

statements, and publicity" on the Fair Play for

Cuba Committee in the United States failed to indicate that

there was any chapter in Dallas or New Orleans and that "we

never in our life heard of him (Oswald)."

ferred to US press reports on Oswald's attempt last summer to

"infiltrate" the anti-Castro Student Revolutionary Directorate

in the US and to DRE statements that Oswald was thought at

that time to be

"an agent of the FBI or the CIA." "They

(the

DRE leaders) must know, because they have many dealings

with them, what FBI and CIA agents look like," Castro stated.

Castro

Castro then declared that, while Oswald

may or may not

be guilty, it is nevertheless possible that he was "an agent

for the CIA or the FBI, as those people suspected" and could

have been "a tool of the most reactionary sectors which may

have been hatching a sinister plan, which may have plotted

the assassination of Kennedy because they disagreed with his

international policy."

"What is behind all this? What sinister

maneuver are they hatching behind all this?

sponsible for the assassination of President Kennedy? And who

benefits from the assassination...except the worst reaction-

aries?"

Castro warned that it is not possible at this point

to answer these questions, "but we do say that it is suspect,

that we must be cautious and vigilant and alert."

closed with the usual expressions of confidence that the

Cubans will be ready to meet any new crisis with resolution.

The Cuban defensive military alert, ordered immediately

after the news of President Kennedy's death, remains in

OTHER CUBAN REACTIONS TO THE ASSASSINATION:

A clandestine source reports that the chargé of the Cuban

Embassy in Santiago de Chile said that there is no doubt that

the CIA or "other Yankees" assassinated the President and that,

as a result,

a third world war will start.

He also emphasized

the need for Cuba to prepare for a possible US invasion.

November stating:
