ADMINISTRATIVE:

The Los Angeles Division in its efforts to penetrate

Into the Italian underworld has, since the submission of the last

report, developed a live source, LA 4412-C-TE,

who has now

maneuvered himself into a position where he is in daily contact

with SALVAIORE LOUIS PISCOPO: As aresult of this activity, the

Los Angeles Division has now been able to ascertain that PISCOPO,

who is intimately associated with NICK GUST SIMPONIS, a Greek

gambler in the Los Angeles area, evidently is a member of a

New York family though he himself has been in the Los Angeles area

for a period of some 20 years having been brought here by JOHNNY

ROSSELLI to participate with ROSSELLI and WILLIE BIOFF in the

ola theatrical union wherein ROSSELLI and BIOFF were convicted

even гo3at ana

011.1

for shaking down the movie industry.

Mike,

On 11/30/62, PISCOPO departed the-tos Angeles area

supposedly at the request of his boss in New York and this infor-

mant mentioned above was able to determine from PISCOPO that in

his New York trip the family which PISCOPO was a member of had a

new

boss who

was young and who had succeeded an old and sick man.

The

association of PISCOPO with MICHAEL ANTHONY RIZZI-In the fALl

group and he is possibly referring to SALVATORE PROFACI when he

speaks of a new boss.

The Los Angeles Division is presently effecting a

confidential source in connection with PISCOPO in its efforts to

further penetrate into the Italian underworld and the set up of.

the various families.

There is no information available at this time that

would tend to show any one individual as the head of a family in

this area such as has been reported by the New York Division in

connection with their recent interviews of persons asimowladgeable

of tnese matters. The person best suited for this role seems
