No

identification of this individual is in th

witness list except an address

"Binghamton, New York." I

is probable he is identical toL

I bellhop at

the Arlington Hotel, Binghamton, New York,

since 1943.

Tis currently a PCI of the Albany Division. His file

was opened 10/15/59, and we have been in contact with him as

a PCI, initial contact 10/12/59. He has not previously been

interviewed in respect to the matters concerned in U. S. vs

BONANNO or re the Apalachin meeting hoodlums. No information

has yet been obtained from

MrS. ANNA DILLENBECK

Two letterhead memoranda forwarded covering inter-

views at Endicott, N.Y., on 2/11/58 and 3/12/58.

In respect to the interview of DILLENBECK on

2/11/58 this was set out initially in report of SA PATRICK A.

MUNLEY dated 4/30/58 at Albany, captioned "JOSEPH BARBARA, SR.,

Was., Anti-Racketeering," which is not suitable for dissemina-

tion. It should be noted that the report indicates that the

investigation was conducted by SA DARWIN D. SHATRAW; however,

in checking SA PATRICK A. MUNLEY was present during the

interview which was jointly conducted by these two Agents.

The memo reflects these Agents conducted the interview and

it is requested that Bureau copies of the seport be altered

to make this correction (at page 26). Albany reports have

been corrected.

The interview on 3/12/58 was initially set out in

Albany letter to Philadelphia 3/24/58 (interoffice).
