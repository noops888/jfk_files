19 August 1993

MEMORANDUM FOR:

VIA:

FROM:

SUBJECT:

Director of Central Intelligence

Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

Executive Director

David D. Gries

Director, Center for the Study of Intelligence

Release of JFK Documents

1. By Monday evening, 23 August, CIA will have met the

deadline for release of JFK assassination records. Although the

1992 Act fixed Sunday, 22 August, as the deadline, the National

Archives has determined that Monday, 23 August, is the working

deadline.

2. One shipment of 23,000 pages was sent to Archives on

Monday, 16 August.

This shipment is the subject of the New York

Times article of 19 August, which states incorrectly that CIA

"would make public only about 23,000 pages of documents." PAI is

contacting the Times in an effort to correct the record.

A second and much larger shipment will be sent to

Archives in stages on Friday, Saturday, and Monday, 20-23 August.

4. Although we are pleased to have met the deadline,

redactions on many pages and the approximately 10,000 pages

withheld in total are likely to lead to criticism, especially

from long-time critics like James Lesar, who is quoted in the

From L0ag-tme

Times article.

After passage of the deadline, CIA will still retain

some JFK records. As noted, 10,000 pages are being withheld in

total because they describe sensitive sources and methods.

Approximately 7,000 pages originated by other agencies but found

in CIA files and sent to originating agencies for coordination

have not yet been returned to CIA for release. Approximately

20,000 pages originated by Congressional staffers during the

assassination investigation are'stored atuCIA and ultimately must

be processed for release by Archives, which has been delegated

authority by congress to review recards originated by Congress.

SUBJECT: Release of JFK Documents

Finally, CIA holds 73 reels of microfilm which we intena to ask

the Review Board created by the 1992 Act to exempt from release

because a large portion qualify for postponement on grounds of

sensitivity, privacy, irrelevance, or duplication of recoras

already released.

5. CIA involvement with JFK records will continue into the

future. The White, House has yet to appoint a Review Board.

it does, the Board will have the right to review all records

redacted

or withheld.

This process is

likely to require years of

effort and much debate back and forth.
