The source

mentioned in the Lil is MY 5593-C-TE

who furnished the information to SAS DANIEL F. GARDE

д..

JOHN

MARTIN DOGGETT and JOSEPH A. GEORGE.

Huch of the information

which he summarized on 12/28/67 he had previously furnished,

in part, on previous dates during December, 1967.

The LHll is classified "Confidential" to protect

the identity of a

source of continuing value.

The source had a tentative arrangement to meet with

VIXAMAR in London during the week of 12/25/67, at the Royal

Lancaster Hotel for reassurances of facts as outlined by

VIXANAR and in order that he might speak with principals of

Cogswell and Harrison, as well as with col. peteRs.

Source

has advised, however, that as of 12/24/57,

ne had decided

to gracefully withdraw from involvement in the plans of viXaAP

and source's investigative. assist to this office because it had

the transactions worked out by constell

and harrison with VIXAMAR may be more in the nature of a

confidence game in which VIXAMAR is to be the victim than a

serious intention on the part of cogswell and Harrison to

actually become involved in a real invasion action.

LEADS

The NYD and recipient offices will be alert for

any additional pertinent information concerning this matter

which may be made available through established sources and

promptly advise the Bureau and interested offices of any

significant developments.

It is source's diagnosis that some of the parties

that Vixamar has

involved in his

plans have probably succeeded

in cleverly déluding him in a confidence game type operation

source concludes from Vixamar's conduct that he has.

possibly been

"washed out" of operational.

and immediate

future.

He also concludes that,

hands for tas present

reasons best

known to vixamar and Julian, Julian appears to be out of the

operation, and that Julian and Vixamar apparently no longer

trust one another. The source furnished the following

particulars:

•On December 14, 1967, the source received a visit

from Vixamar who came alone unaccompanied by Hubert Julian.

Vixamar indicated the intention of operating without the

assistance of Julian, and emphasized his desire that Julian

should not be apprised of this and

any of his future dealings

with the source.

He indicated that he did not fully trust

Jultan, telt that he was evil, and feared he might be working

a double cross in selling information to the forces of Duvalier.

Vixamar claimed to have at his disposal a substantial

number of important personages from

the emerging nations who are

also financing his venture to a limited extent, and that the

Government of Chad is rendering

all possible assistance to his

program.

He disclosed that the negotiations with Cogswell and

Harrison at London had been founded by Julian and carried out

by him on Vixamar's behalf. Vixamar verified that he did

verified that he did ous

actually meet with colonel J. (John) Peters, who confirmed to..

Vixamar all the details as to his troops and training

program

allegedly in progress for the invasion. The transaction arranged

with Cogswell and Harrison, for the sum of two and a half million

dollars, covered overall total charges for a

flying boat, motor

torpedo boat, arms and munitions, and in addition the total

troop complement would not be less than 200 trained men, most

of whom

were previously experienced in the congo fighting under

Tshombe and later under Mobutu.

According

arrangement

to Vixamar, the

with Cogswell and Harrison included the overall

services of Colonel j. Peters and his complement of troops.

Henry Vixamar

Vixamar offered the source the explanation that

the letter of confirmation he received from

Cogswell and

Harrison was on a letterhead with a Liechenstein address

rather than a London address, because the firm as well as

all the parties

to the arrangement had agreed that it would

be improper. to imply that the British Government was

sanctioning the transaction, and that for all practical

purposes it would be made to appear that the

was

taking place in a neutral.country, that is Liechenstein.

Vixamar also mentioned that he feared that the intelligence

agencies of Great Britain would tend to dispoil his transaction

and

ambitions.

Colonel John Peters, according to Vixamar,

would be named Chief of Staff and would remain

following an invasion until. such time as full military

support was able to

protect Vixamar.

Vixamar disclosed to source that Julian had recently

received word from Cogswell and Harrison to the effect that

the Dominican Republic was no longer to be necessarily

considered for use as a jump-off spot for the invasion,

and that once a one-third payment had been made to the

merchandise and troops would be dispatched to an undisclosed

point and the invasion would be on a direct basis rather than

through employment of a stop-over or jump-off point.

Vixamar asserted that his operation. is not involved

in any way with Colonel Caamano, former Rebel Chief of Staff

during the Dominican

war in 1965, and that his relationship.

the President

of the Dominican Republic was through Irwin

Davidson (probably 1. Irving Davidson), Public Relations Counsel

in washington, D.C., who is presently representing president

Balaguer and is also closely linked to the invasion operation

through Colonel J. Peters

and Cogswell and Harrison.

Vixamar

that his operation includes support from the

Castro Government.

He asserted

that he is not a Communist

and has had no contact with the chinese, but that if his

nonetary problems were not worked out, he would then ir

In recent telephone conversations with sources

Julian has been pleading poverty to the extent of urgently

December 24,

1967, Julian advised source that cogswell

of the situation there.

Source made the following observations:

Cogswell and Harrison by one. or more persons with the overall

plan of relieving him of invasion operational funds, although

this is only conjecture.
