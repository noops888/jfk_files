According to the above source, RAY arrived in

arrival, he contacted some of his Miami associates in the.

Junta Revolucionaria Cubana (Cuban Revolutionary Juntad (JURS),

including SONIO, DAVILA, HERIBERTO DEL PORTO, LORENZO RUIZ

and LINO PEREZS He requested them to confer with him at

the home of Mrs.

Florida, which they did

SARA JODIO, 7730 Southwest 3lst Street,

Miami,

He indicated he was in favor of former members of

the Union

• Information Center (CIS), another anti-CASTRO

organization, affiliating themselves with JUrE.

He indicated,

however, that former CIS members, who are mostly students,

should be most circumspect in their relations with student

organizatios in the United States, inasmuch as he believes

some such organizations might have bean infiltrated by

communists. /m)

RAY also indicated he welcomed the assistance

of the anti-CASTRO organization Cuban Representation "in

Exile (RECE), which 1s headed by JOSE BOSCH, President of

the Bacardi Corporation. (cYm)

In any action sponsored by JURE,
