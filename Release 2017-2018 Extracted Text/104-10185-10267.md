3. It is realized that an operational progress report and a contact

report are two different items; however, in view of the detailed nature of

the LITANILy CO's the Station has felt that their submission has satisfied

the requirements of operational reporting. The criticism of reference s

all the mure puzzling since auch visitors to the Station as Chester D.

bainold, Chief, Wise; corton A. Wolley,

ersturile Chiet of Operations, wid;

ünd Thomas l. Lund, present lexic. Branch Chief, have ill expressed their

approval of the detalled operational reporting on this speration durtes

visite thes have made to the Station at which tims the repors in questlen

have neen brought to ther attention,

Whea LITANIS next extts PiRai, the Staülon will begin to

prepare formal sperational progress reports on the operation.

As for the questions raised in paragraph 2 of reference resarding

operationai securliy, advance infornation on AMANTL-O's recall cane froz

ITE:VOl but he was not Inforned of the irminence of hls.transfer untli 1t

was reported routinely by LINwill? ard wus zenerally mown by his collia

As for the implication that LITANIlmy was Informed of the Station's

capability to interiapt smoassy telephore conversations,

reading of the lemorandu: under critique sill show that no such aliciovie

ledgement sas nase, LIPAlIty was informed that "re have a zoad chance

of being told abust such a conversazion by wie of our friends," l.e, that

MEPORANDUM FOR THS RECORD.

FROM

Lawrence F. lurker

SUSJECT.g

Meeting sith LITAMIn?,. 16 Jan 6l

I,.A metire was held with In? on the night of 16 Jan. Pickup was

made at the corn"- of Peferia and Altal (Lonas) and In9 was driven to the

vleinity of the recently acguired safe apartnent which will be used for thie

operation in the future,

kher he irarned that the neeting would be held in

an apartment he got a bad case of'nerves, said "I don't like this one bit,"

and came very close to refusing. Rorker finally convinced him that this one

meeting should be held there and that if, after tallang things over, I

d1d not feel safe there the place rould not be used for further meetings.

B. entered the safe ajaripent at 2017 and If showed up at 2046. By this time

ho was almost shaking. Eesirring ty reminding In that the two had elways

worked together nell by beire perfectly frank and open with each other; B

proposed that Iny state his resons for being afraid of holding mectinga in

a safe apartment, after which 8 would state his reasons in favor of the

proposition, a: the eid of which I-y would be allowed to decide whether the

apartment ahould be used in the future.

2e Ing rambled all ever the rap, referred to his many meetingo with

his oarlier c/O Shryock, sonetired two or three in one days said he had

absolute confidence in 3, but aidn't trust other people, etce, eto. The

reasons for his alleye to safehousos did not becars evident so B bezan hia

spiel and held forth on the good points of the new retire place - In and

B would never be together except hehind these walls . could not be seen

together an a cover story for use of the apartrent explained to the portera

B's presence (she could be counted on to spread 1t around a bit)s thero aro

tro good looking women Iiving in ither apartments in the same building which

could explain In!'s harirs entered if anyone knowing him were to seo him go

In (he 1a a bachelor), the perser fros than the apartment is oub-leased does

not lenew Big-nave cr identity, Big a: would never ke parked in front of the

house, etce, etc. In acimuledged all this but repeated his statement that

he doesnit

trust

other pecle. Then 1t finally cane out, he was under the

Impression that the apartuest has to be used by B for reeting numerous other

agents . apparently he cou's not concelve of our obtaining an apartment to

use for meeting one lone agent. As soon as he was assured that he was the

coly agent wo would be sat there he calmed down and relaxed noticeably. In

his mind's eye he had bona seeing a penetration agent point out the apartnent

and causing it to be witched by che opposition which would eventually catch

Ing going 1n. Ln9 required 5's: assurances three different times during the

meeting that other persens would not be met there.

This caused 8 to delivor

a short course on court niation and show If that we would considor 1t

folly to meet more than ese agent in the naro place. (For the record, 1t

ahould be noted that agent DURIP nay be net thare fron tire to tina = 1t

1a not planned that the apartment «ill be exposed to any other sagote).
