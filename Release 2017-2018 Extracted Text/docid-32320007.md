Title: JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION

RECORDS COLLECTION ACT OF 1992

Synopsis: Response to OPCA EC dated 6/19/97.

Details:

In April 1996, Legat Bern sent captioned file to FBIHQ

to be microfiched;

therefore,. Bern is unable to provide full

details of activity on this matter.

Legat Bern, however, does

recollect that a search of Bern records was conducted, either by

FBIHQ or Bern, and that certain references to the JFK

assassination were located in Bern files. These references

pertained to information received from a

confidential Swiss

source.

subsequently, Bern obtained the consent of the Swiss

source

to release certain, but not all, information to the JFK

Assassination Review Board.

Legat Bern can advise that JFK Task Force is fully

aware of the information contained in Bern files that refer to

the JFK assassination and that whatever information can be

released has already been released.

Leget Bern regrets not being able to provide further

details and suggests the OPCA may want to locate the file at

FBIHQ for that information.
