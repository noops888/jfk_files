SA PIERCE also, through wiring

presently in the building, traced an inside 10 or 11 pair

cable, which appears in the rear room, 775 S. 8th Street.

The red-blue pair of this cable was connected to the out-

side box and presently runs to the CP, Philadelphia.

Philadelphia will continue to maintain the

altered

The missing 44A block described in Philadelphia letter

of 12/17/64 is being deleted from Philadelphia inventory.

Enclosed herewith is a portion of the cover

for the above-described 10 or i11 pair inside cable.

is requested that Philadelphia be forwarded a Minimite.

This minimite will be installed inside the cable and ac-

cordingIy, a minimite of the smallest proportions is needed

for this purpose.

Philadelphia will upon receipt of the requested

minimite install this minimite in the above-described

cable.

This cable in the building is no longer in use,

has been cut and taped at the end and.

appears near the

floor

of the rear room of this address.

It is felt this will af-

ford adequate security.
