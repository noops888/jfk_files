known him for some time."" LEVINSON

that a large bankroll was required.

out the gambling fraternity in Las Vegas, Nevada, and tended to

substantiate the rumor that EDDIE LEVINSON was a partner with

JAMES SNYDER in his bookmaking operation.

self completely aloof from.all such operations.

operating in the manner described above, but due to the many

problems trought on by investigations conducted by the IRS and

the FEl in the Las Vegas, Nevada area, LEVINSON is operating in
