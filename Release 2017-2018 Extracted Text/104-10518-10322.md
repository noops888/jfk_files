people in order to obtain US support.

le related to Source that He was willig

to obtain certain items frow within Cuba in order to prove HIS worth and abili-

Ey. HE proposed to have some of the top officials defect to the US; the defec

tion of the najority of a creu, to Include the Captain, of a new KOAY patrol

boat; and the obtainment of the newest jet aircraft supplied to Cuba by che

Soviet Union.

In return SUBJECT wanted a guarantee that the persons coming out

of Cuba sculd be free to remain active against Castro, as opposed to being sent

into exile sonewhere in the US. Addicionally, SUBJECT wanted to retain the

YOMAR for action against Cuba or be supplied with a vessel or sinilar features

wich which to operate.

SUBJECT related chat HE already has an island chosen to

use as a base of operations, however, Source could not supply the name or loca

tion of the Island.

SUBJECT retains a strong feeling that if the people who

defect to the US, during this demonstration of ability, are left to operate

against Castro, then the people inside Cuba will rapidly join the movement.

The defection of the KOMAR pacrol boat, as well as the jet aircraft, can be

accomplished in a matter cf a few weeks.

SUBJECT is sioply walting

for the

"green light" from someone In a high position.

As an addicional requirement SUBJECT stated that following RIS suc-

cessful procureront of naterial and people, li wanted i guararteed pipaiine of

supplies and equipaent from-HIS base of operations to the guerilla unfis operat

ing inside Cuba.

Proposed methods of infiltrating the material into Cuba were

described as beach landings, which would be simplified by the fact that SUBJECT

has access to the patrol schedules of Cuban and Russian vessels operacing

around the Cuban painland.

Additionally, SUBJECT presently has people of the

organization poised to sabotage radar installations along the Cuban coastline.

In reference to the organization, allegedly active within Cuba as

well as the US, and under the explicit control of SUBJECT, Source mentioned

that

"cells" were organized throughout Cuba as well as dispersed in the US.

SUBJECT has maintained contact with all of the cell leaders by an unknown

nethod.

liames of the members could not be furnished; however, Source stated

that he visited SUBJECT unannounced and met two individuals whose nanes he

could not recall, however, he believed them to be members of Alpha 66.

Source questioned SUBJECT concerning the men and Alpha 66, and SUBJECT stated

that lE would not include then in any activity or proposed plans because HE

knew that plans of Alpha 66, once formulated, were common knowledge in Cuba

hours after the plans are conceived. Source believed the name of one of the

Individuals was Minola P:y. Source also belleved that SUBJECT'S organtzacion

had a craining area in the
