ADMINISTRATIVE

Delay in report is noted, however, this case

investigated on a continuing basis and maintained

a current status.

On October 16, last contact made with CG 7016-CTE

whose identity as upper

echelon leader of organized crime

in Chicago known to Bureau.

CTE advised that he attended

a top leadership meeting shortly after death of RICCA in

which current situation was subject.

Present at meeting

and LESLIE RUSE,

all upper echelon leaders of organized

crime with responsibility for affairs of organized crime

in Loop, souty side, and Lake County, Illinois, respectively.

At meeting ACCARDO announced he will remain

top leader of organized crime

and RICCA will not be replaced.

However, ACCARDO informed ALEX he will rely more and more on

ALEX's advice on policy matters.

CTE advised that ALEX,

probably thermost intelligent and personable hoodlum

leader now avallable has during past several years since

death of MURRAY L. HUMPHREYS, assumed more and more

responsibilities due to respect which he commands from

all leaders and members and from contacts outside

organization in politics, labor,

and lègitimate business.

CTE advised that close relationship which has existed

(for decades between ALEX and hoodlum Attorney SIDNEY R.

AKORSHAK, probably the best contact organized crime has in

eountry, stands ALEX in good stead since he is able to

move himself and

other organized crime figures into

favorable situations through KORSHAK throughout the

country.

CTE also advised that JOSEPH AIUPPA, upper

echelon leader of organized crime with responsibility

for CIcero,

Illinois, wilt also be relied on more heavily in

future by ACCARDO:

CTE advised AIUPPA is not particularly

intelligent or capable hoodlum but has brought money

into organization for decades and has never

"stumbled"

by bringing any particular heat to organization, other

than that which normally accrues to top leaders.
