contemplated gambling casino would be the big problem

as they feel

the customers would be stopped from

leaving the shores of the United States.

MM 744-C advised that the Surfside Six Floating

Homes became a Florida Corporation in 1960, and the

officers are LAWRENCE VITA, President, RALPH WEIDLER,

RONES is

WEIDLER for the past eleven years has been doing sub-

contracting work under his own name at Levittown,

Pennsylvania, and prior to that did sub-contracting work

for Levitt & Sons in New York City for eleven years and

before that he was construction superintendent for Levitt

& sons.

Homes,

Inc., maintains an average medium four to low

five figure balance at the bank, has a secured loan of five

figures and pays 1ts obligations from prompt to sixty

days slow.

He also related VITA 1s allegedly single and

about 47 years old.

It should be noted the proposed "Atlantis

Isle" gambling casino is allegedly a multi-million dollar

venture, and the operation of the Surfside Six Floating

Homes indicates a large amount of the money would have

to come from other sources.

MM 509-C-TE also reported that he received

information that JOHN TRONOLONE (MM 92-455) 1s no longer

bookmaking, that he turned his customers over to EDDIE

GOLD, but secures a certain per cent of the amount his

old customers lose.

According to his information, TRONOLONE

is now shylocking and playing: cards at the Patio Bridge

Club, Miami Beach.
