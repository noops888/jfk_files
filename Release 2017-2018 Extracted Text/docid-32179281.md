"On the evening of November 27, 1963;

a meeting of the Erie County

Communist Party

took place at the home of Sy Rudner who lives

on st. James Place in Burfalo. Present were

Sy and Ann Rudner, Rose and John Touralchuk.

John and Ivory Mokenzie, and Marty Zelman. &f4

"They talked about the murder of

President Kennedy. They took the position

that it was not reported in the newspapers,

but it was actually done by others in Texas,

especially those on the far Right..

They

also thought that the murder of Lee oswald.

the accused killer of President Kennedy, was

a cover-up and that the police coula have

They looked upon

President Kennedy's death and Oswald's as a

big piot.

John McKerzie said that he belleved

Oswald killed Kennedy, but kas motive is

unknown.

Sy, Marty, and the Touralchuks said

that Oswald did not kill the late President,

but that he was framed and was being blamed

as the killer: (lu)

"They talked about Norm Roggow

still trying to get into the Communist Party;

They said that Norm does not act like a

Party person.

They criticized him for being

too open about the Party and failing to cover

his feelings about the Party. They suspect

him because he is so very busy about every-

thing and too anxious to get into the Party

and also too active in the National Association

for the Advancement of Colored People. All

this makes them suspicious of him.

They

don't plan to let him come into the Party,

but

they will continue to check further on

him.
