A former CIA agent told The News

recently that Le Couvre was sabotaged

by

water at night and attached a bomb to

the ship's hull, under the waterline. The

bomb, a detonator and a timing device

were in a waterproof container,

he said.

The ex-agent added that the frog-

men were Cubans working for the CIA.

"It was definitely

supposed to go off around 3 a.m., when
