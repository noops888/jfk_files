In 2953.

Dr. LAZO compiled a formidable file on the Subject

and was in communication with a Washington, D.C. legal firm

which BARKER dimly recalle as that of Edward Bennett WILLIAlS,

who was to handle the case locally. A private bill is intro

duced in the 83rd Congress by Congressman WILLIAHS of New Jersey

to restoro the Subject's citizenship, but BARKEl does not know

why no action was taken on the bill. At the time, he was in

financial difficulties and took a job as a tractor driver out

side Havana for about 8 months, In which period he had ro contact

with Dr. INZO, who, as BARKER belloves, interpreted his failure

to appear in the office as a lack of interest in pressing the case

to a successful conclusion.
