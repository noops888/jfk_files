Instant Case

• ADMINISTRATIVE •

Although this case is being placed in a closed

status, the Miami Office is continuing its investigation of

the case entitled, "CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS, ET AL; FPM-CUBA;

REGISTRATION ACT

and this Office will continue alert for

any information relative to the "RESISTANCE COMMANDOS".

It

appears that the "RESISTANCE COMMANDOS" may be primarily a

figment of ORTEGA's imagination, created for the purpose of

keeping BATISTA off balance through propaganda prepared by

ORTEGA as described in this report.

- REFERENCE -

Bulet to Miami dated January 4, 1955.

This report classified SECRET since it contains informa-

tion from CIA classified accordingly.
