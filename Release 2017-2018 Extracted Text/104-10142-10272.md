77-Clearance

2.3. (Confidential - LLM) LIAISON Called Gerry Burke, NSA,

and indicated that as late as Iriday night, Dave Bushong, Senate Select

Committee on Intelligence staff, was still of the opinion that Schator

James Pearson (R., Kansas) would be traveling to the NSA facility in

England. Later, Burke advised that the matter has been resolved that

the Senator will not visit the facility, but instead will receive a briefing from

the NSA representative in London.

24. (Unclassified - LLM) LIAISON In the company of Dick Rininger,

OGC, Don Burns, OS, and Doug Cummins, of our office, I met for several

•hours with Bob Blakey, Chief Counsel, and James Wolf, staff of the House

Select Committee on Assassinations, to review the Committee's

security rules, non-disclosure agreement, and Memorandum of Understanding.

We completed negotiations on the first two documents and resolved one of

the two major problems with the Memorandun of Understanding. I told

Blakey that we would try to have our counter-proposal to him either tomorrow

or the next day which he said would be fine.

25. (Unclassified - LLM) BRIEFING Mike Van Dusen, House

International Relations Committee staff, called to cancel the scheduled

29 July briefing of the Subcommittee on Europe and the Middle Last because

of the pre-recess squeeze on the Committee schedule and the fact that

Chairman Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.) would like to have the DCi appear

sometime in September.

26. (Unclassified - THW) BRIEFING I called Mike Van Dusen,

House International Relations Committee staff, and told him that, unfortunately,

the Director had another meeting which he had to attend on 29 July and, theie-

fore, would not be able to appear before the Subcommittee on Europe and the

Middle Fast on that date. I told him that we would be able to provide a senior

official to brief the Subcommittee which he at first agreed to. He later called

Mr. Miller and said that Chairman Hamilton wanted the Director to appear

and, therefore, asked that the appearance be postponed until after the August

reces::.
