HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIZD BXGACT

WOERE SHOWN OUTRWISE

This memorandum is submitted to amplify information

reported by the New York Division by: teletype as to the visit of the

Attorney General there on November 4, 1963.

The attorney General was particularly interested in the:

' briefing afforded him with regard to espionage matters. It was obvious

from the questions he asked that the President had discussed with him

the Director's visit last week, as the Attorney General seemed cognizant

of the highlights of the particular situations covered. He asked many

questions concerning the difficulties encountered in physical surveillances

in espionage cases and was impressed with the facts related to him by

the Agent Supervisors in New York, predicated on their personal

experiences in conducting this type of operation.

He was informed in some detail as to the countermeasures

.. taken by Soviet agents to detect or neutralize our surveillance activities

andthe corresponding increase in manpower which the FBI has to utilize

[..

to overcome these countermeasures.

"The New York Office described the various(soviet establish

(5)

ments in that Division which pointed up the physical surveillance difficulties

that had to be met. The Attorney General did not ask any questions about

confidential techniques of any kind.

After the briefing was over, the Attorney General shook hands

with each of the Agents and thanked each personally for his contribution to

the meeting.

...'

ASAC:Bryant and Agent Supervisors from the Criminal Section

briefly pointed out the continuing developments in the organized crime

picture in the New York area.

This was well handled, but since it con-

cerned a matter with which the Attorney General was familiar did not

have the impact of the briefing on espionage matters.

The Attorney General has obviously talked frequently with

John McCone and other Central Intelligence Agency officials and may

consequently have had a somewhat restricted viewpoint concerning

espionage. His visit to our New York Office certainly emphasized for

him the importance of the work the Bureau is doing in this field.

As a matter of collateral interest, Ed Guthman, the

Attorney General's Assistant for Public Information, was in New York

Monday for the purpose of conferring with Theodore White, the well-

known author. It is understood that White has prepared a two-part

article for "Life" magazine dealing with the Negro movement in the

United States.

This article is described as being a hard-hitting analysis

of the Negro movement.

Guthman mentioned on the return trip to

Washington that White had in his long manuscript two paragraphs

dealing with the communist influence in the Negro movement. One

reference in this regard was to alleged communist efforts to infiltrate

the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) chapters at Pittsburgh and

Los Angeles. Guthman said that he questioned White about this reference

and was told that this information had been received from CORE officials,

who claimed to have taken decisive action to counter this communist

effort.

Guthman advised there was one other reference to communist

influence.

No names or locations were mentioned, but one individual was

described as having been employed by Martin Luther King and subsequently

discharged. This, of course, is Hunter Pitts O'Dell.

There was one other reference to an unnamed communist,

whose attempt to intilirate had also allegedly been thwarted,

The FBI was not asked to comment on this article in any way.

It was a matter handled solely by Guthman while the Attorney General was

being briefed in our New York Office. He mentioned it in casual conver-

sation and pointed out that

the FBI was not referred to in White's article

in any way.

INTERNAL SECURITY - CUBA

On December 3, 1963, a confidential informant

advised he learned that several requests had been

received by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO),

Washington, D.C., from the PAHO Zone Office in lexico,

instructing the former that under no circumstances should

the PATO in Washington, D.C., address mail directly to

Cuba. (C)

PEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIIA REESE

WHORE SHOW OTHERWISE.

In this connection the folloving information

was brought to the attention of the informant:

The policy of the Cuban Government in relation

to correspondence that comes and goes from Cuba is the

systematic exanination of all letters and parcels that

pass through the Cuban Postal Administration of the

Communication Department. (C)

This policy of the Cuban Government caused the

PANO serious inconvenience. In the first place, correspondence

is delayed because the PAHO pouches are voluminous and

contain a variety of correspondence. The "reading" takes

a long time, and the officials of the Cuban Post Office

are known to have had inspection delays of more than two

months.

The fact that the PAHO Zone Representative in

Cuba hands over the pouches to the Ixpediting Unit,

Correspondence Section, Cuban Department of Public Health,

does not excuse the search, (c

The second great inconvenience is in what is

referred to as confidential correspondence, which, along

with the rest, is read and possibly photographed. (c)

SOG

Soviet hostility toward the SOE (as well as the OSS)

intensified from 1944 onward because of perceived SOE

inefficiency as well as Soviet suspicion of SOE acrivities

in areas considered within the Soviet sphere of influence.

There were, howerer, several examples of successful co-

operation between the SOE and NKVD, especially in

Afghanistan and Yugoslavia.

At the end of the war the SOE dereloped extensive

plans to participare in the soon-to-be-called Cold War,

DO SOLO

CODE NaMe for a longtime CONTRINTELLIGENCE op-

eracon conducted by the tu agains the U.S. Communist

From the mid- 1950s until about 1977 two brothers,

Jack and Morris Childs, were trusted members of the U'.S.

Communist Party, carrying cash from Moscow to the

United States to finance the party, meeting Sovier leaders

Mikita Khrushcher and Leonid Brezhner, and conscring

their Cold War attitudes toward the United States. Ar the

same time, she Childs brothers were informers for the FBI.

Ukrainian-born Morris Childs joined the American

Communist Party in 1921 and was sent to the Lenin

School in Moscows for training as an AGENt in the espi-

onage underground that Soviet intelligence was running

in the United States. In 1932 Morris's younger brother,

Jack, became the business manager of the Young Com-

munist League and was also sent to Moscos for training.

Later Morris became the Moscow correspondent for The

Daily Worker, the newspaper published by the U.S.

Communist Party.

After a hiatus during the 1940s, in 1954 Morris

Childs returned to the communist underground. One of

his duties was getting money from Moscows to U.S. com-

munists. From about that time, however, Morris and

Jack Childs were working for the FBI.

The brothers reported to the FBI that Stanley Levi-

son, a close adviser to civil rights leader Dr. Martin

Luther King, Jr., was a communist. Armed with this in-

formation, l. EDGAk NooNER, director of the FBI, began

his campaign to discredit king and prisately spread the

word to U.S. officials that King had communist ties.

The first authoritative information on the Solo oper-

stion came in The FBl and Martm Luther King Jr.: From

•Solo to Memphis (1981) by historian David J. Garrow.

More details came in Operation Solo (1996) by JOHN

BARRON, an author well connected to FBI sources. Barron

said that Morris Childs had a close relationship with YUrI

astronor, then head of the ack and later the leader of

the Soviet Union. Barron also said that the brothers were

sent on missions co Cuban leader Fidel Castro and

China's Mao Zedong.

Morris Childs reported that he had witnessed meet-

ings about the widening split berween the Soviet Union

and the People's Republic of China. By getting such in-

side intormation through Solo, U'.S. officials had more

knowledge about the Sovier-China breach than histori-

ans had previously believed

the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Sombolay, with an artillery

battabon of the Sth Infantry Dission based in Germany,

pleaded guilty to contacting Iragi officials and commit-

ting espionage.

He negotiated to provide the Iraqis with information

about troop morements to the Middle East and various

military documents. He received approximately $1,300

from the tragis for his efforts, according to an Army

spokesman. He was sentenced to 34 years in prison by an

Army court.

communications with the Sovier Union and learned much

of the contemporary GRU TRADECRAFT.

In June 1963, scheduled to return to the Soviet

Union for a brief visit and then return to the United

States, he elected to remain in his native country, leaving

his wife and children in the Sovier Union. He disappeared

into the population, and not until 1971 did the FBI, in a

Reader's Digest article, reveal his service as a double

00 TURING, ALAN

(b. 1912 d. 1954)

British mathematician and cryprologist at BLETCH-

LEs Park during World War Il who led the group that

found a way to crack Germany's ENIGMA CIPHER ma-

chine.

Turing's maternal grandfather was known as the ge-

nus who saved India for Britain by inventing a fan that

whisked and cooled the subcontinent's hot, humid air.

Following in his grandfather's footsteps, in 1936, two

years after graduating from Cambridge. Turing wrote a

paper. "On Computable Numbers," torecasting the

computer. Flis theoretical version, called the "universal

Turing machine." could, he said, imitate any other ma-

Carrying this theory into reality. Turing and his col-

leagues at Bletchley Park were presented with an Enigma

machine and told to huild another machine that could

fathom its machinations. The team created the BRONZE

CoDEs, a "a large copper-coloured cupboard"; it was

a primitive computer that cracked its first codes in April

1940. This was the beginning of cuts, the epochal ef-

fort that gase the allies the ability to read German

Later, when the Germans upgraded Enigma, Bletch-

ley Park cryptologists, using Turing's theories, built the

colosses, the first programmable digital computer.

Turing, a long-haired young man in "rumpled and

dirty clothes," was a HoMosENtAl. When schoolboys

were reported molested in a town near Bletchley Park

carly in 1944, Turing was transferred to a secret 1116

radio laboratory at Hanslope Park in Buckinghamshire.

There he worked on a voice scrambler, while at Bletchley

Park his colleagues produced the Colossus.

After the war, Turing's homosexuality made him a

SECURITY RISK in the opinion of intelligence officials. He

died of cyanide poisoning after being convicted in Man-

chester of being a practicing homosexual.

COURSE OF ACTION RECOMHENDED AND APPROVED IN JUNE, 1963:

Ky memorandum of 6/26/63 considered future course of action

to be taken in these cases in light of developments at that time.

was pointed out that the karoty informant could be used as a Government

witness in an espionage conspiracy prosecution, which would have as the

main delengant Ivan agorov. soviet national employed by the United

Nations Secretariat. Egorov and his wife, both, of whom did not havi

diplomatic immunity, were observed clearing a/Karot drop In New York

on 6/6/63. It was pointed out that from a trial standpoint, this phase

of the case presented no extra-legal prublems.

My memorandum of 6/26/63 also pointed out that possibly the

Baltches could be brought into the same conspiracy inasnuch as the

Egorovs were observed filling the Baltch drop in New York ( a different

location from that of the [Karot drop) on 6/15/63. It was pointed out

that any prosecution involving the Baltches could raise considerahle

problems in view of the confidential techniques that were used and which

could be raised by the defense during a trial; further, that if se would

proceed with such prosecution it would appear

advisable to drop the

charges of espionage against them if such issues were raised in order

to protect our highly confidential techniques. It was felt, however.

that lesser charges could be made against the Baltches, such as falsely

claiming citizenship, etc.

My memorandum also pointed out that in addition to the

various legal problems involved another possible obstacle would be

reluctance on the part of the State Department and the Administration

to take prosecutive action against Soviet personnel at that tire.

The

Director noted "This is very real."

My memorandum recommended and it was approved that this

entire matter be discussed with the Department concerning the feasibility

of prosecuting the Baltches and Egorov.

DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT:

On 6/27/63 this matter was discussed with Assistant Attorney

General Yeagley and his assistants. It was pointed out that the

involvement of the Egorovs with Karoty presented no extra-legal problens

but that the Baltch case could raise various legal difficulties in view

of the techniques used. He advised the Departnent attorneys that if it

appeared our sources and techniques were jeopardized, it would appear

Yeagley: felt there was a good

possibility of proceeding against the Egorovs and Baltches on the

espionage conspiracy charges and he preferred to proceed on these

charges rather than on lesser offenses. He said he rould discuss this

matter with the Attorney General.

On 7/1/63 Yeagley advised it was the Attorney General's

should proceed with the espionage conspiracy prosecution.

Thereafter,

the Baltches ana the Egorovs were arrested 7/2/63 and indicted 7/15/53.

On 10/11/63 the Esoroys were allowed to return to the Socier Union by

the state Department, In exchange for

| and the charges against them were dismissed. We, of course, were not

even consulted on this matter.

The release of the Egorovs had unquestionably weakened this

prosecution.

Both the

e Departnent aitorneys and United States Attorney

Hoey had expressed this opinion at the time. Hoey went so far as to

state at a conference with Bureau personnel in Washington oD 10/29/53

that 75% of his case disappeared when the Egorovs left.

My memorandum of 12/17/63 raised questions as to the wisdom

of proceeding with this prosecution and it was recommended and approved

by the Director that we again discuss this case with Yeagley concerning

the desirability of dropping the espionage charges against the Baltches

in view of the techniques involved and proceeding on a lesser charge.

On 1/16/64 a conference was held with Yeagley and his assistants

and we again discussed the various points which could involve revelation

of our confidential and tainted techniques. One of the overt acts

alleged in the indictment cited the filling of the Baltch drop by the

Egorovs 6/15/63 and the clearing of this drop by the male Baltch subject

the same day. It was pointed out that if the defense explored how the

FBI knew the location of this drop and how our Agents happened to be in

the drop area on that day, we could not answer nithout revealing the

confidential and tainted

points, it was their consensus that the Government would have to with

draw from the case. In view of the possibility of these problems

arising in this prosecution, Yeagley was asked concerning

the

desirability of dropping theespionage charges and proceeding on lesser

charge, such as falsely claiming citizenship. It was the opinion of

Yeagley and his aides

that the Government should go ahead with the

espionage prosecution because there was the possibility it could be

successful; further, in view of the stilf penalty involved, the Baltches

might attempt to make a deal. Yeagley and his assistants felt chat

dropping the erpionage charges and proceeding on a lesser charge would

show a sign of weakness and that the Government would look much bettes

If it was necessary to drop the case during the trial, thus maising

it appear it was forced to dismiss charges against two Soviet spies

on

legal technicalities. If this occurred, the Government would they

attempt to proceed on lesser grounds.

OBSERVATIONS:

As it can be seen from the foregoing, the Department was mace

fully aware of the problems involved in any espionage prosecution ot

the Baltches from the outset of our discussions with it and of the

possibility it might be forced to drop these charges during the trial

of this case and the Department decided to take its chances.

On September 28, 1964, defense counsel made a motion to

Director asked the above question.

In this regard, the Bureau has from the very outset of

consideration of prosecution in this case advised the Department and

the United States Attorney that during the investigation of this caso

techniques had been used which would not be admissible during tne trial

and highly sensitive sources were used which could never be revealed in

the interest of

national security. These include such things as

technical and microphone contacts, periodic anonymous source contrees,

as well as sophisticated coverage.of mail.

In addition, through the

use of developers

in reading secret ink messages which the subjects received from their

Soviet superiors.

The Bureau's position has been that if any of our

sources and techniques were in danger of being revealed, the case would

be dropped.

outlines the lackground of this case and also sets forth the

torney General Yeagley has advised that USA Hoey in answering questions

Y the Judge gave answers which were too broad and which the Government

cannot supact and therefore it is necessary for the Government to nañe

additional statements to Judge Dooling who is sitting in this case in

the Eastern District of New York. My memorandum of September 30, 195z,

advised that while we were not aware of the contents of the conver-

sations between USA Hoey and Judge Dooling, we had no objections to

Yeagley's proposed amending statement as it was correct.

Subsequently on the afternoon of 10-1-64, Departmental At-

¡torneys Thomas K. Hall and Kevin Maroney advised Supervisor Litrento

¡and myself that USA Hoey's statement to Judge Dooling was unfortunate

because it was too broad.

They believe that the Judge's query per-

tained to any tainted source at the Baltch residence and was confined

to eavesdropping devices, but that Hoey in his answer had not confined

the answer to the residence or to eavesdropping, either of which would

perhaps have prevented the current problem.

(No information obtained

from wiretaps or microphones is contemplated to be used in this case

and the only tainted source is a mail intercept which did not take

(place anywhere near the residence).

Subsequently on the evening of 10-1-64, Mr. Hall advised

that he had just learned that apparently Hoey in his discussions

with the court had stated, oi at least indicated, there

was no microphone involved in'this case and, of course, this was

incurrect and the Department felt the record had to be corrected.

This morning Mr. Hall called to advise that USA Hoey had now requested

advice as to what answer could be given the court should he be asked

(1) if there was a wiretay involved in this case and (2) if there was

a mail intercept in this case.

After checking, I called Hall back and

said that we would leave the answer to #l up to the Department, but

that if the Department saw necessary, the Bureau would not object.

However, with regard to #2; under no circumstances is the Bureau will-

ing to admit that a mail intercept was utilized and Hall said he would

is the code name for the investigation of

the soviet

illegal agents utilizing the identities of Robert and Joy Ann Baitch.

They were arrested July 2, 1963,

and their trial started September 25,

1964, in the Eastern District of New York.

On September 28, 1964, defense counsel made a motion iu

suppress the evidence obtained in the search of the subjects' apartment

on the basis that there was illegal eavesdropping, used. . The judge

heard arguments and asked the Government to furnish the

court. with

information as to whether the Government used illegal eavesdropping

devices in the subjects' apartment house. In connection with this, ürs

Director asked the above question.

In this regard, the Bureau has from the very outset of

consideration of prosecution in this case advised the Deparimevi and

the United States Attorney that during the investigation of this case

techniques had been used which would not be admissible during tne trial

and highly sensitive sources were used which could never be revealed in

technical and microphone contacts, periodic anonymous source contrees,

and sticated. coverage of mad

In addition, through the

Kar, we

were successful

in reading secret

ink messages which the subjects received from their

soviet superiors.

The Bureau's position has been that if any of our

sources and techniques were in danger of being revealed, the case wold

be dropped.

There is attached a memorandum dated June 26, 1963, which

outlines the Lackground of this case and also sets forth the observations

concerning the future course of action in this case.

evidence to be submitted in this

The Judge originally denied the motions, but Assistant Ai

torney General Yeagley has advised that USA Hoey

in answering cuestions

by the Judge gave answers which were too broad and which the Government

cannot supw't and therefore it is necessary for the Government to maje

additional statements to Judge Dooling who is sitting in this case in

the Eastern District of New York. My memorandun of September 30, 1951;

advised that while we were not aware of the contents of the conver-

sations

between USA Hoey and Judge Dooling, we had no objections to

Yeagley's proposed amending statement as it was correct.

Subsequently on the afternoon of 10-1-64, Departmental At-

¡torneys Thomas K. Hall and Kevin Maroney advised Supervisor Litrentu

and myself that USA Hoey's statement to Judge Dooling was unfortunate

because it was too broad. They believe that the Judge's query per-

tained to any tainted source at the Balich residence and was contines

to eavesdropping devices, but that Hoey in his answer had not contined

the answer to the residence or to eavesdropping, either of which wouid

perhays have prevented the current problem.

No intornation obtained

from wiretaps or microphones is contemplated to be used in this case

and the only tainted source is a mail intercept which did not take

place anywhere near the residence).

Subsequently on the evening of 10-1-64, Mr. Hall advised

that he had just learned that apparently Hoey in his discussions

with the court had stated, or at least indicated, there

was no microphone involved in!this case and, of course, this vas

a mail intercept in this case.

that if the Department saw necessary, the Bureau would not object.

ing to admit that a mail intercept was utilized and Hall said he would

Hall advised that he had discussed tlis case with Acting si=

/ torney General Katzenbach this morning and Katzenbach was of the

opinion that the Department must be candid with the Judge. He said

Katzenbach recognized the problems, but felt that in view of the value

of the case, an effort should be made to go ahead with the trial even

if it might be necessary drop the overt act where our taired source

is involved, and proceed on a general conspiracy basis with the recog

nition that the verdict might be against us, but we would have reveaied

:ing on the Acting Attorney General's comments to Assistant Attorney

¡General reagley.

Hall said that the motions of defense counsel and the

complications with regard to the answers may eventually forthe Govern-

ment to drop the prosecution. He said in view of the many facets in

volved, he did not feel there was any reason to agree to a pre-tria

bearing on the issue of tainted source if this should be required by

the court, and rather than do this, they are prepared to drop the es

pionage charges and attempt to proceed on lesser grounds.

ACTION

SAC Schmit, NYO, was advised of the above developments and

reguested to keep in

close touch with Yeagley in New York and you vill

This case involves the two

Soviet illegal agents using the

Identities of Robert and Joy Ann Baltch against whom espionage curspiricy

charges were dismissed on 10/2/64 before Judge John F. Dooling, Jio, in

the United States District Court, Eastern District of New: York. This cas

was dismissed on motion of the Government on national security grounds.

This memorandum is prepared to set forth the background and

facts of this case.

BACKGROUND:

Are yell'

In March, 1959, Bureau was able to saccessfully approach.

• (coủe name )!

5), a GRU illegai agent who

had

entered the United States a short tine before under clandestine

circumstances. He agreed to operate against the Soviets as a defector in

place. He operated in that capacity continuously until June, 1903, when

he was ordered to return to the Soviet Union.

He decided to remain in

Itais country rather than

go home.

Live informant

In January, 1962, the Bureau uncovered the Baltches, also GRU :

illegals, through one of the Bureau's programs, which involves the

screening of applicants to practice cosmetology and hairdressing.

Tre

femaLe subject had been employed in the Baltinore area as a hairdressci

in Washington. Their activities were followed through lookouts,

technical and micropnone coverage established on their residence,

periodic anonymous source contacts, and interception of their mail.

ire

were able to read a number of secret ink messages they had receivr

from the soviets through the use of developers

Awas In the Summer of 1963 ve had learned through their secre. ind

communications that they had expected to return to Moscow sort!:

Around this period information had been received from our sitsource

that all GRU illegals then in the United States would not be recuined,

but would be replaced by others because of disruption in the GRU over

Oleg Penkovsky matter (GRU colonel who was executed by the soviets lor

collaboration with the British and, CIA) •

W. A. Branigan to W. C. Sullivan

Re:

CODE WORD.

65-67201

COURSE OF ACTION RECOLLENDED AND APPROVED IN JUNE, 1963:

Ky memorandum of 6/26/63 considered future course of action

to be taken in these

cases in light of developments at that time.

was pointed out that.theli

*informant could be used as a Goverrrent

witness in an espionage conspiracy prosecution, which would have. is the

main defendant Ivan

Egorov. Soviet national employed by the Unitor

Nations Secretariat.

Egorov and his wife, both of whom did not ha::

diplomatic immunity, were observed clearing alm

¿drop in New York

on 6/6/63.

It was pointed out that fron a trial standpoint, this phase

los the case presented no extra-legal prublems.

My memorandum of 6/26/63 also pointed out that possibly the

Baltches could be brought into the same conspiracy inasmuch as the

Egorovs were observed filling the Baltch drop in New York ( a different

drop) on 6/15/63. It was pointed out.

that any prosecution involving the Baltches could raise considerahle

problems in view of the confidential techniques that were used and wich

could be raised by the defense during a trial; further, that if we could

proceed with such prosecution it

would appear advisable to drop the

charges of espionage against them if such issues were raised in order

to protect our highly confidential techniques. It was felt, however,

that lesser charges could

be made against the Baltches, such as falsely

claining citizenship, etc.

My memorandum also pointed out that in addition to the

various legal problems involved another possible obstacle would be

reluctance on the part of the State Department and the Adninistration

to take prosecutive action against Soviet personnel at that tire.

Tha

Director noted "This is very real."

hy memorandum recommended and it was approved that this

entire matter be discussed with the Department concerning the feasibilit

of prosecuting the Baltches and Egorov.

DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DEPARTIENT:

On 6/27/63 this matter was discussed with Assistant Attorney

General Yeagley and his assistants.

It was pointed out that the

involvement of the Egorovs

• presented no extra-leral proulens

but that the Baltch case could raise various legal difficulties in view

oi the techniques used.

We advised the Department attorneys that if it

appeared our sources and techniques were jeopardized, it would appear

advisable to drop the espionage charges against the subjects and proceed

against them on lesser charges.

Yeagley felt there was a good

possibility of proceeding against the Egorovs and Baltches on the

espionage conspiracy charges and he preferred to proceed on these

charges rather than on lesser offenses. He said he would discuss this

matter with the Attorney General.

On 7/1/63 Yeagley advised it was the Attorney General's

opinion we could not permit the Baltches to leave the country and we

should proceed with the espionage conspiracy prosecution.

the Baltches ana the Egorovs vere arrested 7/2/63 and indiorea 1715/63.

On 10/11/63 the Egorovs were allowed to return to the soviet Union b

the State Department in exchange for

two Americans held by the Soviets

land the charges against them were dismissed. Me, of course, were not

even consulted on this matter.

004414400409

The release

the Egorovs had unquestionably weakened this

prosecution.

Both the Department aitorneys and United States Attorney

Hoey had expressed this opinion at the time.

Hoey went so far as to

state at a conference with Bureau personnel in Washington oD 10/29/53

that 75% of his case disappeared when the Egorovs left.

My memorandum of 12/17/63 raised questions as to the wisdom

of proceeding with this prosecution and it was recommended and approved

by the Director that we again discuss this case with Yeagley concerning

the desirability of dropping the espionage charges against the Baltches

in view of the techniques involved and proceeding on a lesser charge.

On 1/16/64 a conference was held with Yeagley and his assistants

and ve again discussed the various points which could involve revelation

of our confidential and tainted techniques. One of the overt acts

alleged in the indictment cited the filling. of the Baltch drop by the

Egorovs 6/15/63 and the clearing of this drop by the male Balich subject

the same day. It was pointed out that if the defense explored how the

FBI knew the location of this drop and how our Agents happened to be in

the drop area on that day, we could not answer without revealing the

confidential and tainted sources involved. (The location of the drop

was made known to us through a mail interception of a Baltch communication

through the cooperation of postal authorities and the development e

seciet..lak message contained in the conmunication!

It was

the consensus oi yeagley and his aides that a good possibility cristed

that the defense might not raise these points and that even if raised,

the court might not allow the defense to explore these points as

Irrelevant. However, if the court allowed the defense to expiore these

Re:

points, it was their consensus that the Government would have to with-

draw from the case.

In view of the possibility of these problems

arising in this prosecution, Yeagley was asked concerning the

desirability of dropping the espionage charges and proceeding on lesser

charge, such as falsely claiming citizenship. It was the opinion of

Yeagley and his aides that the Government should go ahead with the

espionage prosecution because there was the possibility it could be

successiul; further, in view of the stiff penalty involved, the

• Baltches

might attempt to make a deal.

Yeagley and his assistants felt that

dropping the erpionage charges and proceeding on a lesser charge would

show a sign of weakness and that the Government would look much better

if it was necessary to drop the case during the trial, thus maiing

it appear it was forced to dismiss charges against two Soviet spies on

legal technicalities.

If this occurred, the Government would thei

attempt to proceed on lesser grounds.

OBSERVATIONS:

As it can be seen from the foregoing, the Department vas mace

fully aware of the problems involved in any espionage prosecution ot

the Baltches from the outset of our discussions with it and of te

possibility it might be forced to drop these charges during the

trial

of this case and the Department decided to take its chances.

ACTION:

For your information.
