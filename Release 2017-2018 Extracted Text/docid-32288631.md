INFORMANTS

On the afternoon of 12/5/63, former MM 722-C

telephonically advised SA PRUE C. CLINKSCALES, In Miam1

that

on that morning as he was checking into the New York Hilton

Hotel, he observed ALDERISIO along with IRVyWEINER, both of

Chicago, checking out of the New York Hilton Hotel.

Credit

the Americas,

New York City, made available the registration card of

IRVIN SO WEINER, 1019 South State Street, Chicago. Illinois.

According to this card, WEINER is affiliated with the American

Bonding Company.

'WEINER waS assigned Suite 4036-37-38.

The card indicated a party of two persons would occupy the

suite®

The party registered on 12/2/63, at 10:00 A. M., and

departed at 9:58 A.M., 12/5/63. The card indicated two

persons departed:

The hotel folio on IRVIN S. WEINER and party

reflected the following charges:

Phone, $1.00; Room, $79.00;

City Tax, $3.95. The total charges were $83.95.

According to DONALDSON, the phone call was a local

call and no record of these calls is maintained by the hotel.

A check of the registration cards for ALDERISIO and his

aliases was negative.

Since it appears that none of the data listed above

would be helpful in any prosecution against ALDERISIO, 1t

1s not being included in the Details.

Chicago may desire to

include it in reports on their anti-racketeering case

regarding ALDERISIO.
