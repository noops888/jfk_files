MEMORANDUM

To: Mike Madigan

From: Ed Greissing

Date: Sept. 16, 1976

Subject: Review of CIA documents presented the SCI by Jack Anderson

The documents recently received by this Committee, from

Anderson, had previously been reviewed by the Church Committee staff.

The documents appear to be a few of those requested for FOIA review

by David Belin. It is my understanding,

after these documents were

declassified, David Belin furnished copies to both David Martin (AP)

and Jack Anderson.

The Church Committee was permitted to review the entire Oswald

201 file, the AMLASH file, Garrison files and selected Office of

The Committee primarily concerned itself with

early period of the investigation (November 1963 - October 1964), as

it believed the information

to be received from this

to be more relevant in evaluating the performance of the intelligence

agencies with respect to their investigation.

Dan Niescher, the Church Committee contact at the CIA,was the

individual responsible for the declassification of documents

relating

to the assassination of President Kennedy. During this

declassification process, Dan Niescher consulted the Committee staff

to make sure that we were aware of certain documents. In addition,

Mr. Kaleras had given the staff unlimited access to all files we

believed necessary to conduct our investigation.

Yet, the possibility still remains that the staff was not

shown everything. The CIA has maintained throughout that the Oswald

201 file was a complete compilation of the material related to the

who Lee Harvey Oswald was, and what he was

assassination of President Kennedy. Howeve doing are

their files. The Oswald 201 does not attempt to question Oswald's

connection with both pro-Caatro and anti-Castro groups.or any of

the AMLASH information.

ation relating to CIA/U.S. Government attempts to assassinate Fidel

Castro.

August 13, 1976

I recently discussed with Agent Richard Taylor of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation my recollections of pre-

testimony interviews with Mr. John Rosselli prior to Rosselll's

testifying under oath in June of 1975. It is my recollection

that there were several meetings between myself, as counsel for

the Committee, and Rosselli and his attorneys. Rosselli and hia

attorneys expressed. on numerous occasions fear for the well-being

of Rosselli. They insisted and the Committee agreed that I

would conduct interviews prior to the sworn testimony at a

location away from the Senate so as to avoid any publicity.

During these interviews Rosselll, on more than one occasion,

stated that he was taking a great risk in testifying. He was

worried about retallation and particularly worrled about his

relatives: with whom he was living in Florida. I cannot recall

Rosselll specifying exactly who he was most afraid of, but he

declined to testify about Glancana (until after Giancana's death),

refused to identify any of the Cubans who were involved in

assassination plots, and was reluctant to mention Santos

Trafficante by name. In fact, I cannot recall Rosselli ever

mentioning Trafficante by name and only very vaguely responding

to questions if the questioner used the name Trafficante.

whether that conversation took place up in the Senate interview

1975 JAck Modelson june Kelerse

Four and a half years ago, I broke a story that now is belatedly rocking

Washington. I reported that the Central Intelligence Agency had recruited two

Mafia figures, John Roselli and Sam Giancana, to assassinate Cuban Premier

Fidel Castro.

I tracked down Roselli and questioned him about the story. He had nothing

to say. He promised me, however, that he would give me his exclusive story

if he should ever be free to talk.

Yesterday, John Roselli told his story -- first, to the Senate Intelligence

Committee in secret session, then to me as he had promised four and a half

years ago.

Roselli is a dapper, hawk-faced man with a thatch of white hair. He has

been disciplined all his life to keep his mouth shut. His Mafia partner,

Sam Giancana, was slain before Senate investigators could serve him with

a subpoena.

So it was obviously painful for Roselli to talk. I promised I would make

clear that he revealed no names, except for the CIA contacts whose identities

the Senate already knew.

So here is Roselli's own account of a real-life "Mission Impossible" --

the attempt to kill Castro. It is a story of cash payments, poison pellets,

high-powered rifles and powerboat dashes to Cuba.

The plot against Castro, Roselli said, began in 1960 -- when Dwight

Eisenhower was President, Richard Nixon was Vice President and Allen Dulles

was the CIA chief.

Roselli was recruited in Los Angeles, he said, by Robert Maheu, then an

aide to billionaire Howard Hughes. Previously, Maheu had operated a CIA

front in Washington.

## Page 28

53244

Page 2.

According to Roselli, the murdered mobster, Sam Giancana, never became

involved in the assassination plot. He knew about it; he may even have suggested

a Cuban contact; nothing more.

Roselli identified the CIA project officer, in charge of the Castro

assassination, as "Big Jim" O'Connell. Maheu put Roselli in contact with

O'Connell, as Roselli remembers it, in New York City on September 14, 1960.

Thereafter, Roselli flew to Miami and recruited the assassination squads.

At first, they plotted to poison Castro. Poison pellets were supplied by the CIA.

They were delivered to the plotters in a Miami hotel room, according to Roselli,

by Maheu.

He dramatically opened his briefcase, revealing $10, 000 in cash

and the fatal pellets.

The money was distributed tothe Cuban plotters. Roselli swore he never

took any money from the CIA, except for some incidental expenses. He paid the

big expenses, he said, out of his own pocket.

The poison pills were supposed to take three days to work. Supposedly,

this would give the poison time to work its way out of Castro's system before

he died, and his death would be attributed to natural causes.

Roselli never found out what happened to the plotters or the pellets. But

they tried again later with a stronger dose of poison. Not long afterward, reports

reached them that Castro was desperately ill. Roselli doesn't know whether the

illness was caused by the poison or a virus. But Castro survived, and the

plotters apparently did not.

Toselli said he also picked up intelligence, which he submitted to the CLA

both during the Bay of Pigs planning and the later Cuban missile crisis. After

the Bay of Pigs, Roselli said, Maheu was cut out of the plot. Thereafter,

## Page 29

There were four more assassination attempts, the plotters were smuggled

into Cuba with high-powered rifles. The last assassination squad, Roselli heard,

made it to a Havana rooftop before they were caught.

This was around March 1, 1963. Then the project was abandoned. Roselli

saw Harvey for the last time in June, 1963. Five months later, Lee Harvey Oswa

gunned down President Kennedy in Dallas. Oswald had been active in the pro-

Castro movement. Shortly before that dreadful day in Dallas, Oswald had made

a mysterious trip to Mexico where he visited the Cuban embassy. The Warren

Commission found no evidence, however, that Oswald was in the hire of Havana.

Yesterday, Roselli made no apology for his CIA role. U.S. authorities

call him a mobster.

He regards himself as a patriot.

business into a stormy career as How-

(Another person Roselli met in that

era who would later surface to talk of

Roselli, Giancana and John F. Ken-

nedy was a young party girl named Ju-

dith Campbell.)

Maheu and Roselli would later tell

Frank Church's Senate Intelligence

Committee the details of their plots to

kill Castro. Maheu told investigators he

had known Roselli since the late 1950s

and, while he didn't know of his un-

derworld connections,

"it was cer-

tainly evident to me that (Roselli) was

able to accomplish things in Las Vegas

when nobody else seemed to get the

same kind of attention."*

Over dinner at the Brown Derby in

Beverly Hills 16 years ago, Maheu ex-

plained to Roselli that his government

needed his services. Roselli, who was

born on July 4, 1905, was nothing if not

patriotic. (Sam Giancana once said,

"Just wave a flag and Johnny'll follow

you to any canal.") Maheu recalled that

ROSELLI, From LA

Roselli was hesitant at first but "felt he

had an obligation to his government;

and he finally agreed to participate" in

a plan to kill Fidel Castro. He turned

down an offer of $150,000 and even

paid for his own hotel rooms in Miami.

He later introduced Maheu to two co

conspirators, Giancana and

Santos.

Trafficante, an alleged Mafia figure

who operated out of Tampa.

While the strange alliance between

the CIA and organized crime plotted to

kill Castro, Maheu was doing someone

a favor that would almost derail the

project. Church's investigators learned

that the CIA paid for, and Maneu ar-

ranged for, a bug to be installed in

Giancana's Las Vegas apartment. Par

ties to the incident today offer two rea

sons for the placement of that bug.

One explanation was that Giancana

suspected his girlfriend had another

lover and Maheu agreed to place the

tap to ease Giancana's worries while

he stayed at work in Miami. The other

theory is that the CIA was worried be-

cause the agency had heard Giancana

was talking loosely about the Castro

plots.

Whatever the explanation, the place-

ment of the bug was a disaster. Ma-

heu's private eye left the tap unat-

tended

on the afternoon of Oct. 31,

1960, and it was discovered by a maid

who reported it to the local sheriff. Ro-

selli paid the private detective's bail

and eventually the attorney general,

acting under pressure from the CIA,

ordered that any contemplated prose-

cution be dropped because it could

jeopardize the national security opera-

tion in which Giancana and Maheu

were involved. A friend said when.

Giancana learned of the snafu, he

laughed so hard he almost swallowed

But in 1961 the Boom Boom Room

was a swinger's paradise, the place

untraceable poison into Castro's drink.

1975.

History has tended to make the men

behind the plots to kill Castro look

foolish and, indeed, some of the plans

seem as silly as exploding cigars.

Psychological warfare expert Gen.

Edward Lansdale, for example,

hit

upon a pian to convince the Cuban

population that the Second Coming of

Christ was imminent and that Christ

hated Castro. Word was to have been

spread throughout Cuba that on a par-

ticular date a manifestation of Christ's

return would occur. On that date an

American submarine would surface

off the Cuban coast and ignite star-

shells which would lead the Cuban

populace to overthrow Castro. A mem-

ber of the intelligence community sar-

castically tagged Lansdale's bizarre

plan "Elimination by Illumination."

(Asked about that plan recently,

Lansdale replied,

"That's a crock.

Maybe someone was interpreting

things that way. I don't know where

they got such an idea.")

After the flurry of plots in 1960 and

1961, a CIA employee named William

Harvey was assigned to oversee the

"disabling" of foreign leaders. He con-

tacted Roselli but this time asked that

,Maheu and Giancana be kept out of

their discussions. Roselli gave the as-

sassination business another try with

Harvey supplying poison pills, weap

ons and communication equipment to

Cubans who were supposed to kill not

only Castro but also his brother and

another revolutionary upstart named

Che Guevara. Again, no luck, but Ro-

selli and Harvey struck up a friendship

that lasted until Harvey, who retired

from the CLA to practice law in Indian-

apolis, died of a heart attack recently.

In 1966 the FBI threatened to deport

Roselli unless he helped them by in-

forming against the Mafia. Roselli's

original CIA contact, Sheffield Ed

wards, told the FBI that Roselli

"wanted to keep square with the bu-

reau" but was afraid he'd be killed for

"talking." Later that year Foselli was

arrested for his involvement in a Los

Angeles gambling scheme in which a

peephole allegedly was used to survey

a card table at the Friar's Club; elec-

tronic impulses then tipped players to

their opponents' hands.

I spoke with Senator hart today about setting up interviews

I will try to have a subpoena for Santos Trafficante signed

by Senator Baker before he leaves for the convention. We, how-

must obtain the approval of all or a majority of the

members of the Committee (under the Rules) to issue the subpoena.

Therefore, I have asked Martha to poll members on two questions:

Trafficante;

(2) Authority for Senator Hart to disclose

to the Miami police investigators in the Rosselli

ROSSELLI CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS

Meets Maheu at insurance friend's home.

Late July/early August. Maheu calls. Working for government. Recruit

Rosselli only. Meet Brown Derby, L.A., for lunch. Long talk about

project in Cuba. Rosselli wants

verification.

2nd meeting, L.A., discuss further details, no discussion of specific

techniques.

Plan

to meet in N.Y. for verification.

Sept. 14, 1960. First meeting in N.Y. at old Plaza Hotel. Rosselli

introduced by Maheu to O'Connell.

Rosselli "knew"' O'Connell worked

for the CIA. Rosselli agrees to work on Cuban project.

Sept. 25, 1960. Maheu and Rosselli travel to Miami to begin making

contact with Cubans to be recruited for mission.

(Between Sept. 25 and the Bay of Pigs, a series of recruitments, meetings,

and arrangements were made.

The following is an outline of events that

is not necessarily in chronological order.)

-- Meeting where Maheu is introduced to Trafficante. Meeting

where Maheu is introduced to Giancana.

Giancana was, according

to Rosselli, to only be a 'back up man." Rosselli states

Giancana had nothing to do with the actual operation. Trafficante

was used, according to Rosselli, as a translator.

-- Meeting with O'Connell, Maheu, Rosselli, and turnamtsalee

discuss the Cuban project.

-- Rosselli, in his contact with the Cubans, "invents" the cover

story that he represents some Wall Street business interests who

want to see Castro eliminated. Rosselli trusts Cubans he has

recruited because they are part of the Bay of Pigs operation.

-- Ist attempt at assassination involved the use of pills. Maheu

and Rosselli met with Cuban #1 and #2 (?).

Maheu opened up his

briefcase and gave the pills with instructions for their use to

Cuban #1. Maheu also had $10,000 he gave the Cubans for doing

the project. Rosselli did not know of the money. Rosselli states

he received no remuneration for his work on the project, in fact,

he paid out $800 for gas for a speed boat to deliver two or three

man parties for guerrilla raids into Cuba.

-- Prior to Bay of Pigs there was no discussion of using guns to

assassinate Castro.

-- Rosselli's cover name was "John Ralston."

-- At different times, Cuban #1, #2, or #3 would propose different

projects.

These would range from using plastic explosives to

booby trapping Castro's desk. Rosselli would relay these on

to Maheu, who, in turn, would contact the CIA. Most projects

were vetoed, but the CIA did supply a short wave radio to the

•Cubans in Florida, to try and make contact with their people

in Havana.

-- Eventually, Rosselli felt the project had failed. There was no

specific point when it was announced.

But, at sometime Rosselli

assumed the project, for whatever reason, had not succeeded.

1961

After the Bay of Pigs (April 1961)

Rosselli felt "sorry for the poor bastards left on the

beach 100et for today eat it a pa chate

pate in the invasion Iwo or three weeks after the

invasion, Rosselli was contacted in Los Angeles by

O'Connell, a meeting was

arranged for at the airport

hotel in Miami.

Rosselli went there and was introduced

to Harvey. O'Connell said Harvey was now in charge of

the Cuban project.

Harvey told Rosselli he was to cease

all contact with Maheu and Giancana.

Further, Harvey

stated that the government was still interested in using

Rosselli for intelligence-gathering operations.

Rosselli

would report information from the Cubans to Harvey about

personalities and events in Cuba. Rosselli would also

relay on to his Cuban contacts requests for specific in-

formation from the CIA.

i

Sometime between the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban

missile crisis, Harvey gave Rosselli six poison capsules.

Rosselli, in turn, gave them to his Cuban contacts who

were to take them to Cuba, where another Cuban or Cubans

would use them to assassinate Castro. Rosselli never

learned the details of what happened, but the project ob-

viously failed.

At one point, Rosselli remembers hearing

over the radio that Castro was very ill. A short time

later, he recovered.

Sometime before the missile crisis, Rosselli arranged,

pursuant to Cuban #1 request, for a van loaded with rifles

and ammunition to be delivered in Florida. O'Connell and

Rosselli watched the Cuban contact pick up the van and

return it empty. Rosselli assumed that these guns were

going to be used by the two or three-man raiding parties

in Cuba

to assassinate Castro and overthrow the government.

During the Cuban missile crisis, Rosselli was in Chicago.

He contacted Harvey at Harvey's mother's home in Indian-

apolis and left his number in Chicago. Harvey then called

him, told him to go to Washington, D.C. From Washington,

D.C., Rosselli traveled to Florida where he stayed for

the duration of the Cuban missile crisis. He, at times,

would, through his Cuban contacts, attempt to verify the

location of the Russian missiles in Cuba.

Rosselli claimed

that this had been successful. After the Cuban missile

crisis, Harvey called Rosselli and told him to stop all

contacts with any and all persons involved in past Cuban

missions. Harvey never stated why the missions were being

called off.

Rowan Tap

Rosselli said that he understood that Giancana had

asked Maheu for a tap on Dan Rowan. Maheu gave

Rosselli two stories.

The first was that he was

doing Giancana a favor and the second was that there

was a real intelligence value in that Maheu was

afraid that Giancana or Rowan might be giving out

intelligence information that would be of value to

enemies of the United States.

Rosselli had not heard

of the names Dubois or Belotti or Fred Harrison. He

admitted that Harvey had discussed the tap with him,

but both Harvey and Rosselli were mad that the opera-

tion had gone on. Giancana obviously knew about the

tap.

Maheu did ask Rosselli to get bail money for

the two tappers who were caught and thrown in jail.

Maheu suggested that Rosselli could get a hotel to

turn over the bail money.

Finally, Rosselli arranged

to have a man with a green carnation in his lapel

meet and transfer the bail money. He never received

any of this money back.

Rosselli claims that he did

not know what type of tap went on. He admitted that

he had been questioned by the FBI but he gave no

answers.

Rosselli knew that Maheu had been questioned

by the FBI.
