on either side, and it has no street or alley behind it. Customarily,

the back yard is clearly illuminated at night by several permanent

spot lights.

GABRIEL MANNARINO, his wife, JEAN, and their two

teenage daughters occupy the house.

As the Bureau has been notified previously, GABRIEL MANNARINO's

cottage on Old Leechburg Road, in Allegheny Township, Westmoreland

County, Pa., is a one-story, frame building, which sits back

about 300 feet from the road on a 10 acre tract which slope:

from front to rear. It has a small lake in front of 1t, and

that it does not seem feasible toconsider establishing a highly

confidential source.

With regard to the MANNARINO offices at 1263 Third Avenue,

New Kensington, Pa., It 1s noted that this is a one story,

The area between the gate, the scrap piles and the office

building is brightly illuminated by a group of spotlights.

Recently, It has been determined that this office is protected

by the Silent Service System, an electronic burglar alarm system

which is monitored directly by the New Kensington PD.

It would seem that the most Ilkely spot to attempt to establish

a baghly confidential source would be at the MANNARINO cottage,

but efforts will have to be made to resolve some of the

problems, such as monitoring (the cottage is about 35 miles

from the

Pittsburgh Office); ingress (the dogs and a caretake

hose schedule is Irregular and security (location and coverag

of all possible visitors, and possibility that there is a

burglar-alarm installed).
