Historical Review Group

SUBJECT: JFK Assassination Records

Proposed Regulations

1. Attached for your review and comment is a copy of

proposed regulations prepared by the JFK Assassination

Records Review Board.

The regulations focus

on the

definition of "assassination record", which is very broad.

The possibility of requiring additional records searches is

raised.

2. The Board plans to discuss the regulations at its

next meeting on 6-7 March, so it would be helpful to give

the Board our input in advance of that meeting.

Please

provide Barry Harrelson (x30292) or me (x30373) with your

comments by 1 March.
