Attached is the "final draft" of the script for the

HSCA staff presentation on 15 September. Due some

time ago it arrived this morning, We requested that

all new sections and changes be marked, to facilitate

this review (the earlier draft having boen reviewed

already).

The notations in the margins are for this

purpose.

It is requested that this be given priority attention.

Please advise me as soon as you are ready for _comment..

Klein (the HSCA staffer handling this) had wanted our

comments back by today, which the timing of receipt has

interfered with, but we should do as well as possible.
