BY QUALIFIED HQ. DESK ONLY

John CRYER arrived on 15 October 1959 and a survey was made of QDDALE':

office that same afternoon.

Since ODDALE was expecting members

group to visit him again on 16 October and since there appeared to be no particular

technical difficulties in Installing the equipment, it was decided to make the

installation that same night.

2. The installation involved several unforeseen difficulties but CRYER, with

some strictly non-technical assistance from KARNLEY

lation made during the night.

st the mont of 1o october to eaten

was tested and QDDALE was given Instruction on the wee of it.

The test was

excellent and QDDALE was very pleased with this performance.

3. With respect to the handling in the future, it should be realized that

a number of these interviews which are taped may be

in Spanish and some assistance

therefore may be required in the processing of the tapes.

Also, as you know,

this office does not have a recorder on which these tapes might be played.

Initially I Intend to see if a recorder 1s not available on a loan basis from

the local KUCLUB people and perhaps they may even give an assist on transcribing

some of the tapes which come off In Spanish.

should the requirements be frequent

and time-consuming, however, some other arrangements will have to be made.
