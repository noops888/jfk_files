Introduction

In 1974 the Contral Intelligence Agency (CIA) spent

at Leastl

million

in countrics ranging from

for "covert action." Covert action is secret action.:

to influence events in foreign countries which is so designed

that, is discoverod, official U.S. government participation

can be plausibly donied. In its attempts to influence events

it is distinguishable from clandestine intelligence gathering

--

often referred to as espionage.

What is the legal authority for the CIA to conduct covert

actions? This paper is one of a scries that will attempt to

answer the question. It will first examine the predecessor

agencies to the CIA in order that the establishment of the

CIA may be placed in historical perspective. Next, it will

set out the legislative history of the National Security Act

of 1947, the basic charter of the CIA, and the National

Security Council directives which instructed the CIA to con-

duct various forms of covert action. Finally, it will present

i legal analysis of the 1947 Act. Other papors in the series

will examine the impact on the CiA's authority to conduct

covert action of Congressional provision of funds of the CiA,
