Re Miami airtel to Bureau 6/21/63, with enclosures,

and Bulet to Miami 7/23/63.

It is noted U. S. Customs and police on 6/20/63

raided the

residence of

CARLOS ZARRAGA and confiscated a

quantity of arms and ammunition. This was as a result of

information received from MM 639-5 and disseminated to

U. S. Customs.I(X(m)

ZARRAGA was last interviewed by Miami on 1/25/63

in case entitled, "POSSIBLE ANTI-CASTRO RAID SCHEDULED FOR

ABOUT 12/16/62,"

Bufile 2-1787.

SA ROBERT JAMS DWYER conducted the interview and

states it is a custom among Cubans to serve to visitors

received at their homes or offices small demitasse cups

black, strong, bitter Cuban coffee. SA DWYER cannot recall

if he

was offered coffee or not but he doubts he drank it

inasmuch as he does not like Cuban coffee.

ZARRAGA has not been checked,

contacted or

interviewed by Miami Office since 1/25/63.
