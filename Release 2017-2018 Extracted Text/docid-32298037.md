With reference to your paragraph five, as far as is known

to the authoritles in the Bahamas, the only way in which the false

statements were used was in the original press and television interviews

Given by ASHMANN In Miami on llth March,

1963. They were certainly

referred to in these interviews, but whether of not they were physically.

produced is not known.

With reference to your fihal paragraph,,

the authorities in the

Bahamas are unable to help on the

identities of the persons said to

have returned to Florida with HARGRAVES,

However, a report from

the Bahamas states that one of the three U.S. citizens apprehended

at forman's lay on 30th March, 1963, made a vague reference to the fact

that tho boat in which HARGRAVES saild for Cuba was 'similarly armed" to

that in which he

was arrested by the U.S. Customs in December, 1962,

UNRECONDED COPY FILED IN

Apart from the above, it is regretted that nothing of security

Interest has been discovered from the counter-Cuban counter-revolutionary

operations in which the Bahamas authorities have been involvede
