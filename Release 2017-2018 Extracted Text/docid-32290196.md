(SEE BUFILE 62-117290)

The purpose of this memorandum is to advise of numerous

gangland murders which have occurred during the past two years in the

following cities throughout the United States: Chicago, New York,

Las Vegas, Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix and Milwaukee.

SYNOPSIS:

Since February, 1975, at least ll LCN members and associates

have met with violent deaths. These victims were all murdered under

somewhat similar circumstances and each was shot a number of times

in the back of the head with a . 22 pistol. Many of the weapons were

equipped with a silencer.

There have been additional gangland murders

wherein complete details have not been reported to date, 'one occurring

in New Orleans, Louisiana, and others in the New York City area. Two

of the weapons and silencers recovered in these murders were later

found to have been purchased at the same gun shop in Miami, Florida.

In several of these murders, the victims were 'hit" as they either en-

tered or left their vehicles.

On two occasions, the cars had flat tires

and, as the victims stepped out of their vehicles, they were shot from

5

types of ammunition was used in each murder. A strong possibility exists

that two individuals are responsible for many of these murders and that

orders for the "hits" were issued by ranking LCN functionaries.

"DATE: 11-14-2017

Memorandum to Mr. Fehl

Re: La Cosa Nostra Gangland Slayings

Of the above individuals murdered to date, information

obtained from high-level informants and other sources tends to

indicate that two hitmen are traveling around the country handling

high-level LCN 'hits." Based on information provided by[SD-1064- TE]

just prior to his death, a strong possibility exists that these individuals

may be identical to Joseph Charles Hansen, & wolf-Known Chicago

burglar residing in Los Angeles, California, and another/Chicago

burglar, residence unknown, by,the name of Paul John Shir... Both

Hansen and shiro are close associates of Tony Spilotro, and have been

for several years.
