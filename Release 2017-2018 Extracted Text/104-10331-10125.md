ARRB Determinations

1.

Per our phone conversation earlier today, please

find attached a copy of the 28 November letter to the DCI

from David Marwell, Executive Director, Assassination

Records Review Board and, a copy of the document in question

(104-10015-10398): I have marked in brackets the

information (3 items) that we proposed for postponement. As

you wild note from the letter,

the ARRB upheld only 2

postponements

(Whitten's name)

and scheduled the document

for review on "name day" in December.

The ARRB released the

phrase "A Good KUBARK Asset". Please ignore the column

"ARRB releases"

These numbers refer to the number of

deletions in these documents in the August 1993 release to

NARA. Many of those deletion can now be released under

current guidelines.

2. The timeline for this

determination (33 documents)

is as follows:

November 13/14

November 28

ARRB meeting

Notification to Agency of ARRB

decisions.

December

5

7 day deadline for notifying White

House of plan to appeal (this

deadline was set by White House and

is not within the law).

December

28

30. day deadline for White House

decision to release documents as

recommended by ARRB or to uphold an

appeal;

OR

December

28

if no appeal, documents due at

NARA on this

date as required by

law.

3. At DO's reguest (Ellie) I am including notes that

were prepared for the ADDO on the release of information in

recent ARRB determinations including document 104-100015-

10398 (paragraph 3. d.).
