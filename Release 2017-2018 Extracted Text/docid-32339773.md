A review of NYO indices reflects as follows:

In the entertainment section of the 8/23/49 edition

of the "Daily Worker,"

appears an article written by ALINE

MOSBY entitled "A Cycle of Films About People in Wheelchairs

Coming Soon."

She describes in this article a trend in

Hollywood to produce movies depicting the problems encountered

by persons who are forced to spend the rest of their lives in

a wheelchair.

The 4/20/62 edition of the "New York Dally Mirror"

contains a brief biographic sketch of ALIND

MOSBY by SIDNEY

FIEIDS in his column entitled

"Only Human.

FIELDS

mosbey

describes MOSBY as

a trim, attractive blonde

from Missoula, Montana, who has been a newspaper woman since

1945 and was

the first permanent lady correspondent assigned

to Moscow.

MOSBY had just written a book entitled "The View

From No. 13 Peoples Street,

"which is described as her account

of how she got into Russia

• in 1959, what it was like for an

American girl to live there and how foreigners live in' Russia.

FIELDS quotes her as saying,

"They're getting more and more

Oh, they want

fingers in other people's pies.

He quotes her as saying?

"They

It's like a religion with

the head office in Moscow,

ALINE MOSBY, in a UPI article dated 11/23/63, Paris,

France, recalls that

she interviewed LEE HARVEY OSWALD in

Moscow in 1959. She stated that she judged him as a person

very determined but unsure of himself, naive and emotionally

unbalanced.

On 11/2/64,

NY 4488-Sadvised that on 10/30/64 he

met ALTEEN MOSBEY (ph).

In the

course of a discussion, MOSBEY

related that she had

spent three years in Moscow in some

capacity and she was then studying at the Russian Institute

at Columbia University.

The source said that MOSBEY appeared

to be well aware of the duplicities of Soviets and soviet

nationals. She asked him about ALEKSANDYR BESSMERINYKH and BAL U

indicated

that she knew him, apparently having met him at the

UN. 78(4)

In NY file captioned "ALEKSANDR A. BESSMERTNYKH"

(Bufile 105-91431, NYfile 105-43646), BESSMERTNYKH is described

in 1965 as a Soviet national who is employed as a Political

Affairs Officer, Department of Political and security Council

AIlairs, UN secretariat CSLU

is not an employee of the KGB, he is not certain about his

status as an agent of the KGB.

On 3/4/68, THOMAS ZUMBO (protect by request-reliable),

City Editor, United

Press International, NYC, advised that

ALINE MOSBY has been in NY for about a year and a half and

she handles the Foreign Desk for UPI.

be a loyal American and has no rcason to believe that she

would not be cooperative in an

interview.

In view of the above, it is recommended that ALINE

MOSBY be interviewed in connection with this

case.

Request of Bureau

The Bureau is requested to advise whether or not

ALINE MOSBY should be interviewed.
