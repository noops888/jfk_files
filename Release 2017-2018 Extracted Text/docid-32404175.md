FOIA Request F89-0276

Memorandum from John F. Pereira, Chief,

subject CSI/IMO, ded 20 Apr 93, Same

1.

The attached material represents the completion of

HRG'S FOIA review, against the above-cited FOIA case, of

Wayne Jackson's history: "Allen Welsh Dulles As Director of

Central Intelligence, 27 February 1953--29 November 1961, "

one of a series of DCI historical studies.

This history

' had

beén the subject of a Historical Review Program

declassification review in 1991-1992, which was interrupted

a year ago so HRG could concentrate

on the JFK Assassination

files.

2.

Included in this package are: (1) fully redacted

copies of Volumes I, II, and III of the history,

incorporating all determinations by the Directorate and DCI

IROs in 1991-1992, ready for delivery to the requester; (2)

one copy of Volume V of the history, which we recommend be

denied in full; (3) five copies of Volume IV of the history,

one for each IRO (this is the only volume which had not been

sent to the IROs for coordination in 1992), with yellow

highlighting to identify deletions recommended by HRG and

separate memos alerting each IRO to sensitive material in

his or her field of responsibility; (4) a summary package of.

correspondence between the former CRB/HRS and the IROS

regarding the handling of Volumes I, II, and III, and (5) a

copy of C/HRG memo of 20 April 1993 to CSI/IMO on this FOIA

We have included cover sheets for Volumes I-III and

V, indicating the FOIA exemptions for those four volumes.

You will note in the correspondence from O-DCI/IRO

that Becky Rant recommends coordinating Volumes II and III •

with the NSC and Volume II with DOD.

We have kept an extensive case file of this case,

against the day HRG might again take up this history for HRP

review. If you need any part of it, let me know.

5.

Please send a copy of your final release version

of Volume IV to HRG,

to my attention.
