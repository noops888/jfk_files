Two particular points emerged from the reinterview

of the CIA source: (1) Source reported that a CORU meeting

was held in the Dominican Republic some time between 19 and

21 June, 1976, probably in Bonao, and identified the

following Cuban exiles as having been in attendance: (P)(U)

In order to fully comprehend the significance

of the statement by the source that a CORU meeting was held

in the Dominican Republic between 19 and 21 June, 1976,

it is necessary to set forth the aggragate of information

available to the 00 regarding the CORU meeting in the

Dominican Republic in June, 1976, inasmuch as upon close

analysis it becomes apparent that there were in fact, if

the source's information is accurate, two meetings in the

- = On March 9, 1977, Dr. RAFAEL.RIVAS VASQUEZ,

Deputy Direetor, DISIP, advised that in Jane, 1976, two

meetings were held in the Dominican Republic which

were

attended by leaders of the principal Cuban exile organizations.

They had two meetings, the first one, and the larger of the

two, was a political

meeting to agree on a political strategy

for

the various exile Cuban groups.

The other one, a much

smaller meeting, was strictly operational and was attended

by 6 people.

Itsspurpose was to decide on terrorist activity

against Cuba. DISIP learned from a source that the following

people attended the operational meeting: ORLANDO BOSCH,

GUILLERMO NOVO, LUIS POSADA, an unidentified representative

of the Brigade 2506, FRANK CASTRO and ARMANDO LOPEZ ESTRADA.

PROPPER volunteered

that one of his sources identified

representative a the emine

ROBERTO CARBALLO, present Head of the Brigade 2506, as its

was marked up during the meeting, showing the various

divisions of responsibility. For example, POSADA's group

was assigned all of South America and the Caribbean was a

target of opportunity for all groups.

Mr. PROPPER asked

who had been assigned

North America.

RIVAS said he did not

know, but that he had a copy of the map.. PROPPER asked for

a copy...of the map-and RIVAS agreed to furnish it. PROPPER™

explained that he speculated that North America may have

been divided in two by a horizontal line, running across

Subsequent to that meeting, said RIVAS, POSADA'S

RIVAS asserted

that DISIP believes BOSCH was more involved in the Cubana

bombing

than he will admit, but that he was probably not

responsible for it. RIVAS does not believe BOSCH isrumb

and

also com-

plicate things for himself by the bombing.

Dr. RIVAS said BOSCH told him that he believes

the NOVO brothers were responsible for the Cubana bombing.

BOSCH also told RIVAS that the Cuban Exile umbrella organization,

CORU, was responsible for the machinegunning in Rome of

Chilean Christian Democratic leader BERNARDO LEIGHTON.

RIVAS-said that DISIP-believes that CORU was also responsible

for the attempt on the Cuban Consul's life in Merida, as well

as the kidnaping (in conjunction with a right wing Argentine

group called Trinchera) gf two

Cuban embassy clerical em-

ployees in Buenos Aires.

Dominican Republic in June, 1976, From May

13,

1977 Edition of New Times Magazine Article

Entitled, "I Am Going to Declare War" By

BLAKE FLEETWOOD.

FLEETWOOD's article is a result of a four-hour

interview of ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA, who was at the time of the

interview incarcerated in Caracas, Venezuela, for his role

in the October, 1976, bombing by anti-CASTRO exiles of a

Cubana airliner plane, which cost the lives of some 73

people. The interview contained the following information U

regarding the June, 1976, meeting in the Dominican Republic

by anti-CASTRO Cuban exilest

BOSCH's plotting culminated in a secret meeting of

the top terrorist leaders of the hemisphere in the Dominican

Republic.

"The story of CORU (Coordination of the United

Revolutionary Organizations) is true," he told me.

"There

was a meeting in the Bonao mountains of 20 men representing

all different (Cuban exile) activist organizations.

It was a

meeting of all the military and political directors with

revolutionary implications.

It was a great meeting.

Everything was planned there."

The top men from Alpha 66 (New Jersey), Abdalah

(a New

York-based youth group), the 2506 Brigade (veterans

of the Bay ôf Pigs invasion),

FLNC, F14 (New York City)

and Accion Cubana (a group BOSCH headed) met for two days

in the Bonao mountains in early June, 1976.

They decided

to band together under an umbrella organization, coRd

with

BOSCH as the only identified spokesman and leader. U

"At last we had all the Cuban revolutionary

fighters and leaders together after 17 years.

We decided

to upscale the action after that. We wanted to beat the

guy (CASTRO) or at least make his life impossible.

I told

them that we couldn't just keep bombing an embassy here and

a police station there. We had to start taking more serious

actions--hijacking."

(According to a Cuban exile newspaper,

one of the resolutions that came out of that meeting.

"to begin attacking CASTRO's planes in the air.") (u

was a vow

"I accepted the leadership of CORU because

I wanted

to set everything up on an organized basis.

We were tired

of being frustrated and not accomplishing everything that we

wanted to do." BOSCH brought the other leaders up-to-date

on the kind of help they could expect in Nicaragua, the

Dominican Republic, Venezuela and Chile.

Then the group

dispersed.

In the 11 months since that meeting, BOSCH

boasts, CORU has been responsible for over 50 bombings in

(BOSCH refused to admit any personal involvement in bombings

within the United States; police sources say the leaders

because the FBI was putting too much heat on them.)

An analysis of the above information reflects

several obvious factual conflicts Dr. RIVAS VASQUEZ

advised in March, 1977, that one of the DISIP sources

had reported two meetings in the Dominican Republic in

June, 1976.

A larger one, which was a political meeting,

and the smaller one,

which was strictly operational, whose

purpose was to decide on terrorist activity against Cuba.

Among those present at the operational meeting, accordingS

to the source, was GUILLERMO NOVO.

MM 1337-S, who was

also in attendance at the June, 1976, meeting, advised

that the meetings were held in the Dominican Republic

on June 11, 12, and 13, 1976, and that the representatives

from the Cuban Nationalist Movement were Dr. JUAN PULIDO

and JOSE DIONISIO SUAREZ, nOt GUILLERMO NOVO. Moreover,

MM 1337-S presented the conference more as one continuous

than as two separate meetings, but did advise that the

conference contained discussions of future terrorist

activities. (8),

BOSCH, through BLAKE FLEETWOOD, confirmed that

the meeting had

taken place in June of 1976 in the Dominicar

Republic and had been attended by all of the military and

political directors of the different Cuban exile groups.

BOSCH also confirmed through the FLEETWOOD article that

CORU had been formed at that meeting, and that he himself

throush

was the leader. (U)

in his statements confirmed that the

meeting had taken

place and stated that it was only one of

the CORU meetings held in June, 1976 further,

advising that his information came through DISIP agent CS OTHER 1C

LUIS POSADA, stated that JOSE SUAREZ, not GUILLERMO NOVO,

had been

re

resentative from the Cuban Nationalist

Movement

As can be' seen from the above, several distinct

references were made to two meetings in the Dominican

Republic in June of 1976.

They can either be interpreted

as two meetings at the same three-day conference or as a

continuous meeting over a period of several days, which

obviously involved more than one physical encounter of

attendees, which would thereby explain the apparent

conflict.

This in fact was the original interpretation

by the 00 as regards to the above point inasmuch-as MM-13372g

reported the presence of SUAREZ at the June, 1976, meeting

and this was corroborated by another source.

The

00 was

therefore persuaded to believe that in fact ISUAREZ did

attend the meeting, and that the information provided by/S

DISIP which indicated that GUILLERMO NOVO had been the

representative at the meeting, had been simply an error f
