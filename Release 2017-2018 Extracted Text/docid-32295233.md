SMITH stated that after the interest in this ship

has died down,

he would make further inquiry concerning the

explosion.

He said that in the event his inquiry indicated

any matters of mutual interest to the FBI, he would advise

this office; although, at the present time, he considered

this a matter of no interest to the U. S. Government.
