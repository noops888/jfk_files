MEMORANDUM:

A determined effort is being made to create in Mexico a trouble spot

similar tó Cuba.

The Russian and Cuban Embassies, ex-President

Lazaro Cardenas, the Popular Party, which was recently emboldened

to call itself the Socialist party, and a small group of Communist agitators

ard sympathizers (unimportant in number but influential) are strategically!

located in labor unions, such as the railroad, oil, electrical, telephone

and teachers unions, in the National University, the National Polytechnical

Institute and the Normal Schools, and in government posts. These are

the agents of this movement, which should be a matter of the deepest

concern, not only to all Mexicans desirous of preserving freedom in our

country, but to the United States of America in view of the struggle for

survival in which it is engaged against Russia and China. Its triumph

in Mexico would be disastrous because of this country's large population

(35 million compared to Cuba's 7). Its long border with the United States.

and extensive coastlines in the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the

Carihhean Sea, and especially the prestige and leadership it enjoys in other

Latin American countries, where us exampie vuuia le iccisive.

Unfortunately, conditions in Mexico have deteriorated notably since the

last 2 years of the Ruiz Cortines administration, which ended in the midst

of dangerous strikes and widespead agitation.

The administration in

power since December 1958 has repressed violent outbursts and jailed

some of the more notorious leaders (lie Vallejo, Campa and Alfaro

Siqueiros), but it has publicly supported tie Castro regime and has been

iens lian lukewarm te efforts on ine part of other goveraments to deal

with this menace.

President Lopez Mateos has proclaimed that thir

government is on "the extreme leit" and has followed up this statement

with several steps apparently aimed at the complete socialization of

economic life. In a country where the government already engages in

practically every economic activity and exercises virtual control over

mining, agriculture, industry, trade and banking, the steps to which

reference is made, namely the extension of the oil monopoly to the heavy

chemical industry, the acquisition of the third steel mill in importance to

(the largest one was already owned by the government, while the second

one is in private hands), and the nationalization of the electric power

industry by forcing the two most important companies to sell to the

government, have spelled out a clear pattern for a socialist organization

of the national life, in which private enterprise will be permitted to engage

in activities of secondary importance under the over-all direction of the

government.

It is difficult to say whether the policy of the present administration

is due to sympathy for the Cuban revulution and to socialist convictions

on the part of the President and his principal advisers, or, as it has

been widely believed, to fear of Cardenas and the supposedly progressive

elements who surround him. It is said that by his leftiat pronouncements

and socialistic measures, Lopez Mateos hopes to steal their banner and

thus forestall the peril of a revolution aimed at substituting him with a

more radical and anti-American figure.

So far the present social, economic and political trend has not aroused

an opposition comparable to that which met the previous effort to communize

Mexico, conducted from 1934 to 19$0 when Cardenas was President. Many;

years of propaganda have confused intellectual leaders, the business

community is afraid to protest, while many people admire or fear Russia

or believe that socialism is an inevitable development, which it would be

foolish to resist. Also, the present movement is skillfully combined withj

appeals to nationalism and to the envy and resentment towara those wa:

are more deserving or have been "luckier" than the majority.

In Mexico, as throughout the world, the Catholic Church has condemned

Communism with clearness and energy. However, many of its elements

speak of capitalism and Communism as though they were twin evils and

proclaim that the aim of true christians shoulá be, not to eliminate the

abuses and corr+-st the imperfections of the former, but to substitute in I

its place a third system which they vaguely designate as "social justice"

or the "social doctrine of the: Church." Since the existing social order in

Mexico as in the rest of Laiin America with the exception of Cuba, is

still based ou the institutions of private property, freedom of enterprise

and competition which are described as capitalism, in spite of extensive

goverment interventionism and invasion of many economic fields, this

attitude amounts in efect to a collaboration with the Communist and other)

elements who are engaged in destroying it. This possibility does not

seem to frighten the more vehement enemies of the existing organization, j

who go so far as to welcome the destruction of capitalism by Communism;

and who clain, that since this iniquitous system will be unable to survive, i

on the ruins, of both, Catholicism will prevail and inaugurate a new epoch,

Since the weakness of these arguments is so obvious, we shall merely

point out, granting as we do, that capitalism, a free of market or con-.

sumer's economy, is far from perfect, just as historically every great

social system has been, it is surely not necessary to destroy it in order

to reform it, just as a physician does not kill a patient before curing him.

---

## Page 4

104-10175-10063

Moreover, it seems the height of folly to exchange a system under which

the Church can exist and perform its appointed functions, for another!

which is professedly atheisticand which tolerates religious practices i

and ceremonies for tactical reasons, while it can suppress them completely.

Finally, there is not the least assurance that the expectations of the people

to whom we refer will be realized and that Com zunism will be unable; :

to perpetuate itself. The Turks who captured Constantinople in 1453 still

retain it, and while those responsible for the fall of the Byzantine Empire

committed many blunders and even crimes, at least they did not incur in

the supreme folly of welcoming the barbarians who were to substitute i

the sign of Islam for that oi the Cross.

In view of the offensive to which we refer at the beginning of this

document, aimed at establishing in Mexico a second beachhead for.

international Communism, we consider that it is not only convenient but.

urgent and indispensable, that all those who are opposed to it should

emphasize what they have in common instead of what divides us. Only

by uniting our eliorts and by working in ciligently, determinedly and

tirelessly can we hope to defeat this implacable enemy, whose victory

will mean the end not only of capitalism but of civilization and religion.

As for the means and procedure for achieving the union to which we refer.

we are not competent to give an opinion, and therefoze limit ourselves

to stating that we are willing to cooperate sincerely and wholeheartedly

with those whom we consider our friends and allies, in spite of differ.

ences which are undoubtedly secondary when compared with the canger::

in which we sind ourselves.

However, we do believe that positive action is absolutely vital and

in the absence of a united effort to fight Communism, we have formed a

group called Asociacion Nacionalista Mexicana.

This association has clearly defined its "Modus Operandi" for the !

purpose of attacking Communism on three fronts which are: Economic,

Civic and Political. At the same time create a climate in Mexico

unsuitable for further Communist aggression.:

The following is a brief outline describing the plan to attack the

Communists on the economic front:

104-10175-10063

Avail ourselves of the resources, ideals, training, experience

and techniques of the Instituto de larestigaciones Sociales y:

Economicos. Correlate all efforts toward a free market economy

where private initiative and free enserprise may flourish under a

Christian doctrine: and without state intervention .

Defend those members of free enterprise and private initiative

who are now being attacked, namely the small land owner, the

small manufacturer, the small store owner and taxi. cab drivers

and owners. This group may not be important individually but as

a group they are extremely important in our desense of the free

enterprise system as a bulwari against Communism trouga their

individual efforts, public, opinion, civic pressure and voting.

There is a concerted effort on the part of the government to eliminate

this section of free enterprise because it represents a tremendous

obstacle (as it did in Russia) IOwaras stale sOCLauSI. Al lie pIEseni

time the government is slowly but surely attaciving and eliminating this

group one at a time since individually ley are defenseless against the

state and Communist agitators.

At present Communism in Mexico is attacking small property owners,

both private as well as collective. Suck cases have come up very

frequently in the States of: Zacatecas, Jalisco, Gua-ajuato, Michaacán;

Nayarit, Colima, Sinaloa, Sonora, Morelos. Guerrero, and the State

of Mexico, sponsored by Governors Francisco Marsiaez de la Vega

and Juan Gil Preciado, as well as by ex-Governors Braulio Maldonado.

of Baja California, and Margarito Ramirez of Quintana Roo.

When invading private and collective lands, the Communisi Farty

uses Jacinto Lopez, Arturo Oroná, and Ruben Jaramillo, all agrarian:

leaders and Communists. The Asociación Nacionalista Mexicana will:

be able to defend and attack what is considered one of the strongest

Communist attacks directed at the very heart and soul of Mexico. I

they plant the seed of distrust in the Mexican farm program agaiast the

small land owner, it will produce great agitation which will only benefit

the Communist plan in Mexico.

persons. in the city who lack an organized defense of their rights.

such

as taxi drivers, street vendors, etc.

That means that Asociación Nacionalista Mexicana will have an

approximate 3, 000 members from the cab drivers who wish to join

the Asociación for the purpose of having some legal protection.

The second simultaneous attack will be to establish civic groups

whose prime purpose will be to estzblish true patriotism and true:

nationalism.

This group considers that political planning in Mexico is not opportune

because public opinion is still holding on to that very old concept of

"politica del Campañatin", and it prefers to lead a civic struggle, that is..

it will fight to make the democratic vote effective and stimulate the

Mexican people to exercise their rights.

life without taking sides. It will work toward the realization of the ideal

of the Mexican government, limited and respectful of its owe constitution,

of the division of power which constitutes one of the best controls to limit

the always growing power of a modern State.

Since this group will only interfere in civic matter's, it will be easy

to present objectively its points of view, more so since it wante to rocke

an intense campaign for the respect of the rights of citizens and for. the

accomplishment of civic ideals such as: the rescue of moral and

spiritual values; the exaltation of political and civic virtues; the absolute-

purity in the democratic process; a limited government with participation

at all the people; law aad order in all human relations; economic, religious,

educational, civic and political liberty; divorce from exotic ideas and.

doctrines; moderation in the policy of taxes; administrative honesty, etc.

Attached are declarations of principles which have already been published.

These are attached as Annexes 1, 2, 3 and 4.

The third simultaneous attack will be political action, the natural

results of the first two programs. Action will be taken through political

channels to fight Communist infiltration in the government. We will

oppose laws that are detrimental to private initiative and free enterprise

and which tend toward state intervention. We will fight for social

justice, for the defenseless, clean and democratic government, etc.

As has been mentioned before, this association is already formed

and is now working but its efforts have been intermittent namely due

to lack of funds to carry un a continuous effort. Its efforts have been

effectively proved through its attaci against Communisr - in the

School of Economics in the National University. It has constantly

attacked state socialism and exposed Communists in key posts in the

government. It has proved its willingness to establish true friendship

to the United States through a spirit of true nationalism.

At the present time the Communist organizations through Lazaro

Cardenas and othare are exploiting the discontent se the masses agriast

the government and for the Communist cause. There is no other

refuge for these people to turn who would like to see the ineptitude,

graft and moral corruption terminated. The local government is

divorced from its people and the common knowledge •f social injustices

forms an excellent resounding wall for the Communist false promises.

This discontent ard energy must now be channeled toward a democratic

Christian national block which is compatible with the natural tendency

of the Mexican people.

It is urgent that this organization begin to function NOW, continuously

and in all fronts.

Manpower, brains, experience, knowledge, ideals,

will power and determination are available. Our only lack is operating

funds for such a noble and imperative cause.

A minimum operating budget of $5,000 dollars per month is

required or a total of $60, 000 dollars annual requirement. This budget

includes minimum operational overhead, salaries for administrative

personnel and legal action as well as funds to carry on a small newg-

paper and publications in all newspapers.:

As mentioned above, this is a minimum budget and it is expected

that in time more funds will be available through private subscribers

and other groups.

This group can be committed to a sponsorship only under the

following conditions:

The full annual budget to be deposited in a bank and in authorized

person be allowed to draw against this account.

There will be no restrictions placed against this group other than

this money will be used according to the heretofore-mentioned plan..

Inspection of finance and progress can be made at any time by an

authorized person from the sponsoring group, however, at no time will

a written report be submitted. 'I transactions will be verbal and

confidential.

At the end of nine months a reappraisal will be made of the progress

and operations of this group. If at this time the sponsoring group finds

the operations of the local group satisfactory it will announce its

intentions to continue sponsoring this local group either in a more

sponsoring group finds progress, etc., unsatisfactory it will then

announce its intentions to discontinue sponsoring the local group.

I believe the above conditions are natural requirements for the

successiul operation of this type of organization.

• THE MEXICAN WOMAN WILL SHOW HER PATRIOTISM.

Ever since the Mexican woman was incorporated in the country's

civic and political life, the men have asked themselves very curiously

just how the woman is going to accomplish ner democratic task. :

We wan: to know how our wives, our sisters, and our daughters

are going to react to the electoral process.

Speculators are of the opinion that women - especially Mexican

women - "are not made for such things", and that they should continue

doing their hard and complicated work at home, as they used to do be-

We Mexicans are not so "civilized" that we can imagine and

quickly accept some female friend or relative as Mrs. Congresswoman,

Senator or Governor. But we should start getting used to it and no

doubi the marvelious intuition of those feminine minds will help men

find what we have not yet found the way to an authentic and pure reali-

zation of Mexican democracy.

Women invade all fields. Her intelligence is equal to man's

although for generations she has chosen other duries. Continually there

are examples of feminine capacity for tasks previously considered for

men, and these examples are multiplied when women join political life.

Thel numver will be an important and decisive factor in the electoral

forces and they will probably refuse to accept "spent" politicians, - men

whose Integrity is coubtful, and old style politicians, wearing a Texas

hat, a leather jacket and carrying a gun..

Mexican women will also repudiate the tampering of the electoral

urns and above all, they will request a reform of the eleccoral laws,

which give to those elected the faculties to judge the validity of the

electoral process. Also, Mexican women will request the intervention

of another independent power, the Judicial, to act as guard and restorer

of the electoral process if it is violated.

Women will also serve admirably for the Integration of civic or

political groups that will come to renew modern Merican atmosphere

with new ideas and new and better ideals. Undoubredly women will also

ANNEX 3.

MEXICAN CITIZENS:

Our nation, with a "sul generis" democracy Mexican style,

needs to revise electoral and civiü processes to get a true, democratic

functioning of a government of the people for the people, bur with great

respect for minorities which will not only be listened to but also taken

into consideration in the direction of public business.

It has been the habit in our country to abstain from civic activ- i

ities because its citizens think ir is useless to make a democratic

eniort.

However, l is absoiuteiy necessary 10 sip lue -ziay and tui-

fill this ideal that was the truly launching factor of the Mexican revo-

lution against a long tyranny.

The motto "True Vote ito Reelection" has not yet turned into a

positive reality, and it is our patriotic duty to work and fight until it

becomes one.

A group of Mexican citizens, men and women, have decided to

mite ourselves to incite the people of Mexico into the fulfillment of

their civic dies according to the wishes of the President of Mexico,

who in a recert speech encouraged the people of Mexico to create new

parties in order to reach a more democratic performance. It has been

insistently rumored that even the oificiai party (PRI) wüi fird a more

democratic formula in its own constitution, and in so doing provide the

people with an evident example.

We intend to awake civic feelings in Mexican citizens, not only

in the electoral field but in all fields, specially concerning the indis-

pensible cooperation between responsible citizens and a democratic

government limited within our constitutional system of authentic and

definite separation of powers.

We do not feel authorized to frmulate a complete platform of

our principles because we believe that it is a work br all Mexicans who

want to help us in this colossal task; they must give us their ideas to

draw up not only the general principles of the doctrine but also the i

work proceedings and lactics.

In that way we shall look for the more

democratic means rigit at the start of our organization.

---

## Page 13

104-10175-10063

We have decided that whatever the platform we support, it must

include at least the following points.

NATIONAL UNITY of all Mexicans in the common struggle for the ex-

altation and conservation of our authentic Mexican values, historical

tradition and history of our heroes; our democratic ideal based on the

right of liberty in every way.

TRUE NATIONALISM, without demagogical xenophobia that only impedes

universal fraternity, without distinctions nor racial discrimination, in

accordance with our history and tradition of peace-loving country, of

tranquillity and human fraternity.

NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE in every aspeci, wilout wistomising fies

with other countries, working to repudiate exotic doctrines that divide

and incite hate among tuman beings separating the world dangerously

into opposite factions, provoking disorder, sabotage and demagogy in

the countries where these exotic doctrines are introduced.

AUTHENTIC DEMOCRACY, with a total integration of civic virtues,

working towards the elimination of abstention from the electoral progress,

in a constant and vigorous search for a healthy life, respece of minorities,

authentic congressional representation, with participation of all the

people in goverment and its function.

ANOTHER SAMPLE OF PATRIOTISM

"ASOCIACION NACIONALISTA" REORGANIZES ITSELF AND JOINS

THE CIVIC STRUGGLE

"Urgent Call to all Citizens"

We must recognize that the people of Mexico have practically

abandoned their ciric duties.

We complain of the lack of democracy when we do not exercise

the most elemental of our rights. This apathy is criminal at the present

time. We should awaken the civic conscience of the Mexican peoplé.

nato him fore realitv, and taxe active part in pubiic affairs, assuming

his responsibilities and duties and exercising his rigats.

The dialogue öetween Government and Peopie has turned into a

monologue in which only the State talis and the People listen; the, are

not consulted, nor even through organizations representing the people.

These organizations have always suffered from a very defective con-

stitution.

Inteiy the Guvernment has modified its economic policy until

becoming the most important businessman of the courtry, and with

this powerful financial force plus the political forces it bas, it bas

turned into a competitor of the people.

Taxes have been increasing continually and at present rew increases

are being studied which will augment the heavy load that the citizens

have to bear. When industry is forced to pay heavy taxes, these taxes

are added to the cost of the articles they produce and for which the

poor consumer has to pay later.

On the other hand, the nationalist feeling that has always been in

the hearts of Mexicans has been used to justify economic tendencies

such as the nationalization of different industries. The results are not

very satisfactory, such as in the case of Petroleos, Ferrocarriles, etc.

---

## Page 15

104-10175-10063

Furthermore, in the name of a false Mexicanism and a nationzlismi...

"sui generis", absurd zenophobias have been provoked without stopping

to consider that authentic nationalism means pure patriotism, love of

Mexico and what it stands for, love of its history and traditions, love of

its language and customs.. All this makes up the idiosyncrasy of the

people of Mexico, which must be defended from the invasion of exotic

doctrines, such as Communism that pretends to involve us in fratricidal

fights, such as the sad and pathetic case of Cuba. Open and underground

Communists have started a tremendous offensive and some of them have

landed in jail. However, it is much more dangerous to have Communists

hiding behind a cloak, some of them occupying high public positions; this

has been denounced frequently, such as in the University where they have

obtained leadership in certain faculties; in the press, publishing magazines

of a clear and open Communist tendency (like "Siempre", "Politica",

"La Voz de la Calle"', "La Voz del Pueblo", etc.); in intellectual circles

through intellertiale and editore of clear encialiet tendenciog- in artistic

circles of activities such as painting, sculpture, engraving; they are even

hiding in the ranks of the biggest and most serious newspapers, where they -

control, for example, the Sunday supplements.

Communism, the "red wave" that threate. ns the world, has set its

attention on Mexico as its next conquest. The only effective way to fight

the red monster that threatens us is fortifying our authentic nationalisra,.

defending our liberty proclaimed by our heroes, thousands of whom offered

their lives to accomplisa their high ideas.

Communism can be fought with a true and authentic nationalism that

does not consitute a factor of division or discord, but of unity and peaceful

co-existence.

We must correct the errors of false patriots and start celending our

true nationalism peacefully and serenely; we must proclaim that authentic

nationalism is not a mortal hate for foreigners for the mere fact of being

foreigners. On the contrary, authentic nationalism is a doctrine of peace,

harmony and tranquility; it is a proclamation of friendship to foreigners

who have come to our country to live and work with us in the creation. of.

a better country. Authentic nationalism is also an infinite usderstanding

of our social and historic role. We should not continue to preach

revolutionary demagogt; after fifty years we should realize that it has

done its work.

---

## Page 16

104-10175-10063

Let us quit inciting hate against those who lost fifty years ago and

let us try to wore in peace and in unity on the road of progress.

Let us eliminate the struggle among the different social classes and

look for a better understanding between them to get a joint increase of

life level for all Mexicans without taking anybody's rights away. Authentic

nationalism declares bat the right of property is sacred, and that one of

the practical ways to get economic improvenient for all Mexicans is to

turn everybody into property owners, not "proletarians".

Authentic nationalism proposes the exaltation of high spiritual values

combined with the purest material ideals in an autnentic combination for

the rescue of those virtues that seem to be forgotten.

Let us proclaim our traditional virtues of Mexican nobility and

hospitality; let us start on national campaigns of good manners and

cleanliness: let us proclaim the advantagoa of a decent and honect life,

when everyone can truly enjoy the product of their work without false dema-

gogy that pretends to make believe that the welfare of many will be obtained;

by taking away from the minority.

Let us understand that a democratic life is an obligation of each

Mexican and that civic rights, when exercised, will result in a true

and solid democracy that will defend us against any intent of totalitarianism

or Communism.

Let us work in cleaning the nation voluntarily; in a campaign of

moderation in all aspects; in setting our children good example with

positive facts so that they wont tura into "rebels without a cause"; in

inviting the womas to participate in all facets of civic life and recognize

her great responsibility as mother and companion of man. Let us try

to make the daily behavior of Mexicans more digrified, fighting against

"dirty language", insolence, vulgarity, etc.

Let us be an example to the rest of the world of what it means to be

unted under the purest ideals of liberty, order and democracy. Lei us

sanctify our homes and exercise the above-mentioned virtues.

Let us fight to preserve our pure traditions, our religious holidays,

our actions, our national holidays without letting the mystice take

advantage for their own unspeakable ends. Let us exalt the virtues of

our heroes so that they may serve asexample to our youth. Let us

stimulate man in his constant work, forever eliminating the "Saint

Monday", Saturday's drunken feast, and spending salaries in centers

of vice. Let us proclaim the virtues of saving and ter: perance.

Authentic nationalism must creat an atmosphere of peace, tran-

quility and trust to those foreign tourists that come to admire out

natural beauties, to obrerve our foliclore and enjoy our climate.

We must strive for an economic policy based on free enterprise

and initiative, especially of consumers.

We must encourage the trust of the national investor so that his

investment may originate the general improvement of the masses of

workers, and conslant and new sources of work for those who have just

become of age to work. We must avoia lne saù exodus aí our "braceros",

which constitutes a painful national drain.

Let us stimulate the rational and scientific exploitation of our natural

resources, eliminating the absurd notion to keep them intact.

We should create an atmosphere of trust in our work. The union of

Mexicans through authentic nationalism must create a peaceful atmosphere

that will prevent demonstration and acts of violence that subversive

elements of society incite for their own purposes. ' Let us fight to dignify

public administration, honesty in handling money, do away with politician-

Let us eliminate forever the hateful and shameful custom of the

"mordida" and the "tortuguismo" in public offices,. of "aviadores" who

enjoy privileges and salaries not earned. Let us try to make true a

clean and quick administration of justice, giving it cleanliness and aignity

to the court houses.

Authentic nationalism fights misery in all its manifestations and

considers that to do away with it, it isn't enough to have demagogic

promises; we must have indispensible ele ...ints of investment for the

creation of a clean and coordinated industrialization complemented

Authentic nationalism fights for a clean economic policy. that will

prevent inflation and the depreciation of our money, that will look for

natural unforced equilibrium of exports and imports, through stimulation,

Genuine nationalism must be made up by each and every Mexican

listening to the legitimate opinion of each and every one for the better

knowledge of the problenis and the better solution.

It would be an unending task to continue to ennumerate what it means

to have authentic nationalism. Let us say that it is an inner feeling

that must occupy a place of honor in the hearts of all Mexicans in order

and must occupy a dignified place among the more civilized countries.

Our main objective is to fight for everything that is good, healthy,

for all virtues, and against everything that is bad, sickly, and against

all the vices that we still bave. This campaign of national improvement

for a better, cleaner, and bigger Mexico is an important obligation of

all Mexicans.

WE INVITE YOU, AUTHENTIC MEXICAN, to join us in this struggle.

Your presence in our ranks will be weicomed with the future pleagure of

history.

Let as cooperate in making the history of Mexico and the future

of our children. Let us fulfill the duty we acquired when we were bors,

to work intensely for ourselves, for our fellow beings, and for our beloved.

country.
