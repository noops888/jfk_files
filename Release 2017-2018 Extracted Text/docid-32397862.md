VIOLATING U.S. NEUTRALITY LAWS. A BRIEF DISCUSSION FOLLOWED

WHICH NOTED THE LNGOLD WARNING IN MAY 1970 TO CUBAN EXILES

IN MIAMI THAT THE U.S. COULD NO LONGER TOLERATE VIOLATIONS

OF ITS NEUTRALITY LAWS; THE GENERAL BELIEF OF CUBAN EXILES

THAT CONSPIRING TO VIOLATE SUCH LAWS WAS NOT A PROSECUTABLE

OFFENSE: THE FACI THAI BOTH TORRIENTE AND AMCHALK/1 WERE

CATEGORICALLY DISABUSED OF THIS MISCONCEPTION WHEN THEY WERE

INTERVIEWED FOLLOWING THE 12 OCTOBER 1971 RAID ON BOCA DE SAMA.

OF JKLANCE, IF COS DESIRED. COS SUGGESTED THAT HE USE "AN

INLUTE AGENCY" IN SUCH REPORIS RATHER THAN JKLANCE SINCE
