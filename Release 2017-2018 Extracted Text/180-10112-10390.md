MEMO OF CONVERSATION BETWEEN

WM. GEORGE GAUDET AND BERNARD FENSTERWALD

AT WAVELAND, MISSISSIPPI, MAY 13,1975

Gaudet is 67 years of

age and In poor health.

semi-retired.

Writes for local newspaper.

During ww II, Gaudet worked as secret agent in latin America

fOI Nelson RockefelleI, Coordinator of. Latin American affairs under

FDR.

Switched to CIA in 1947 and worked for them until 1969. During

this time he published Latin American Newsletter and Latin American

Report, which he claims were 100% commercial ventures and not CIA

fronts. However, he travelled senstantlu in Latin; America and

combined his commercial.work with his CIA assignments; the latter.

according to him, were basically uncompensated (some expenses were

picked up by cIA) and done for patriotic purposes. There were 3 others

in the New Orleans area who did likewise..

Gaudet is a right-winger; generally disliked JFK.

Kept his CIA activities very secret, not even telling his wife.

•Only told FBI in 1963.: No one else.

Latin American Newsletter cost $15.00 per week.

Both the CIA

and the KGB had in excess of 20 subscriptions! which means that each

of them "subsidized". Gaudet to the tune of more than $15, 000 annually.

As to JFk slaying, believes warren Report is a fairy story

which shall become completely unglued very soon. Believes anti-Castro

forces involved.

Personally believes they had a right to hate JFK.

Thinks plot was hatched soon after Bay of Pigs and came to fruition

in 1963=

As to having the Mexican Iravel Permit serially next to Oswald's,

Gaudet explains that it was complete coincidence and that he never met

Oswald. He backs and fills on whether he flew to merida or Mexico city.

What.is of more interest is the fact thathe was interviewed three times

by FBI about it. Before telling them anything, he checks with "Bill",

the CIA station chief in New Orleans, who, in turn, checks with Langley.

It is decided, that Gaudet should answer questions re Mexican trip but

nothing

more, and FBI promises

to keep Gaudet's name to, itself. and

save his cover.

Apparently, they did so until: 1972 when his name was

(inadvertently?) declassified.

Gaudet says the FBI report about his having reported on ruby's

buying paintings from Borenstein is a complete fabrication.: He didn't

know either Borenstein or. Ruby and he wouldn't volunteer the time of day

to the FBI.

In last week, FBI has called and is going to re-interview

Gaudet.:. For whom?

Gaudet says

he never met Oswald, and

that he only observed him

upon occasion. Question mark on this?

In any event, he describes.him

as a

"miserable little

creature who would do anyting for money."

Believes ho was being financed hy someone, Most seriously doubts 'if

he could have pulled off the rifle fire in Dealey Plaza, as LHO was

terribly nervous and disoiganized.

Believes IHO worked both sides of the "Cuban street,"

Doesn't really admit knowing what he was up to.

Rumored

to have

an office in a building immediately across

street from trade warr.?

Knew LHO went to Mexico by bus.

Gaudet described the CIA set un in New Orleans in detail.

Large offices with approximately

people.

Similar

"to CIA

set. up in all ports, unmarked office.

Unlisted phone.

New Orleans office headed by "Bill",

lawyer, prominent

that "B111". is

CIA New Orlears had closed circuit to Langley:

CIA only paid Gaudet's special travel expenses when their

tasks couldn't be

done on his. regular

trips.

Gaudet was once flown to Langley to brief CIA on Latin

American affairs.

Laughs when he thinks of Rockefeller as head of Commission

to study either CIA or Dallas.

Miscellaneous & Leads

Ferrie knew IHO and Shaw, but shaw wasn't CIA and had nothingh?

person he can think of.

Hunt was

certain that CiA sent Hunt out immediately after Dallas to see what

he could find out about a :

"Cuban connection."

Knows of LHO's cousin, Marilyn Murrett in an intelligence

connection.
