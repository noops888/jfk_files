CIA as "Investigative Agency"

When President John F. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963

the United States investigative agencies--FBI, CIA, Secret service, etc:

--were asked to investigate the assassination.

351

Silvia Duran

The Central Intelligence Agency had relied on Duran's statements

but had deleted Duran's description of Oswald as blonde and short: 706/

It had also excised Duran's statement=="The only aid she could give

Oswald

was advising that he see

the Soviet Consul, and calling

the

person in charge of that office" which alluded to Oswald asking for

some type of aid at the Cuban Consulate. 707/ In addition, Ms. Duran's

strong statement "He never called her back" 707a/ was changed to

"she does not recall whether or not Oswald later telephoned her

strong.

The Committee found no evidence in this file review that Silvia

Duran was either an American or Mexican intelligence agent.

...the Conmittee has interviewed most of the Mexico City Station

Only David Phillips,

Chief of

Covert Action and the Cuban Section in the Mexico City Station in

1963, a position which made him very knowledgeable, considered that

Duran was possibly an agent or source.

DECLASSIFICATION AND/OE

Another CIA employee,l

who worked on an "Oswald

Task Force" in late Soptember or early October of 1975 dealing

with Freedon of Infornation Act law suits brought against the

Agency concerning the files on Lee Harvey Oswald,

stated that he

believed that Ms. Duran may have been a source of information for

either the CIA or the Mexicans. 771/

367

Mr. Hidalgo, professing not to remember all the details, stated

that he thought that Duran was

a Cuban intelligence agent.)

With no corroborating evidence for Mr. Hidalgo's memory, the

Committee must conclude that Silvia Duran was probably never

employed by Cuban Intelligence.

369

Visit to Cuban Consulate

Lee Harvey Oswald visited the Cuban Consulate three times on

September 27, 1963, not twice as the Warren Commission previously

reported. 712/ Oswald first visited the Cuban Consulate at approxi-

mately 11:00 a.m.

as the final destinations ting an intransit visa to Cuba with Russia

â€¢ 713/ He showed her some documents, then

left to obtain photographs needed for his application. 114/

Oswald returned at approx. 1:00 p.n. with four photographs. 715/ 359 .

Oswald returned to the Cuban Consulate between 5:00 p.m. and

6:00 p.m., which was after normal working hours, 10:00 to 2:00 p.m. 723

The guard called Tirado, stating that someone who did not speak

Spanish was at the gate inquiring

about a visa.) 724/

CIA Declined To Aid

The Committee next asked the Central Intelligence Agency to

arrange interviews with LICHANT/1 (Manuel Calvillo), LICOOKIE/1

(June

Cobb,, who may have had information related to Lee Harvey

Oswald's trip to Mexico City. 990/ The Central Intelligence Agency

declined to aid the Committee in this aspect of the investigation. 991/

The Committee returned to Mexico City on August 7, 1978 and

attempted to locate June Cobb Sharp and Manuel Calvillo on

its

own.

992/

393-394

- U.S. Interference

The Committee believes that there is a possibility that a

U.S. Government agency requested the Mexican government to refrain

from aiding the

Committee with this aspect of its work.

395

Oswald's Spanish

The reporter described Oswald as

a strange and introverted

individual who spoke very little Spanish. 1030/

Oswald Imposter

l'he Committee notes the possibility, but does not conclude,

that the missing production from the pulse camera and the LILYRIC

base has something to do with the possibility that someone imper-

sonated Oswald in Mexico.

AMLASH

Professor Blakey stated that the Committee was no longer

interested in interviewing Rolando Cubella.

Captain Felipe Villa stated that the Cuban government;

relying on the seriousness and honesty of the Committee's

thought that the Comnittee should have knowledge of

Cucbela's statements.
