26 Sept OSHALD crossed border by Nil Nuevo Laredo, Tamps., the following

day to Mext City by road. On 27 Sept he went| to Cuban Consulate General

to request visa to transit Cuba because he was going to khar go to Moscow

via Habana: (Consul Fusebio AZCUT told OSWALDithat he Hould have, to

consult his government, that the paper work reguired 10 to 12 days.

OSWALD, beause of his irritable character,

became,

annoyed with AZCUE

and left the office slamming the door.

On 28: Sept OSHALD went to the

Consul General of the Sov Union to request a visa for Russia. He said

In helping his case, that his wife was a Sov citizen, that he was &

militant Communist and had lived three yis In Russia.

¡OSWALD told the

Sor Consul that he could verify this quiokly by calling his wife who was

at that time In New Orleans In a hotel.

The Sov Consul said he would

have to consult with his government

and that ordinarily a case like this

would take from three to four months:

OSWALD again became annoyed as he

had the day before in the Cuban Embassy and left the office very mad.

OSWALD returned to Texas on 3 lot via the border of Nuevo Inredo, Tamps.

Investigations so far do not indicate that OSWALD interviewed higher :

no this could not be true because one wes a jew, that it is definitely

a group of Fasciate, very Amerioan, he 1s owner of & Cabaret of nudi ts

and belongs to political gangsters.

Ceollia says it is absurd it

they let him enter (Ruby entering jail where OSWALD vas). Julieta e:ys

he (Ruby) was there from the first day, that he began to mix with th:

police and newspapermen.

It was perfectly planned, indeed some of the

police probably are of the same organization because Ruby mutrikurgun

techghtshmstex aimed the gun at his chest (OSWALD'a).

Cecilla agrees, the ploture is evidence of that because the police

did not move to try to get in or anything for within a question of

seconds there should have been a reaction.

Juliete hopes they will

continue the investigétion, at least Kennedy's brother has sent a special

agent.

Ceollia says everything about it is strange es the paper stated

they. found this character (Ruby) drinking Coca Cole on the second fluor

and they just left him there.

Jullete adds that fron the s very first

everything was absurd, that he was a Communist.

Cecilia says this type

(OSWALD) could not be nuts; because the whole thing was so perfectly

planned'and that is evident since the bullet was aimed at Kennedy.

Juliets belleves that this: 1s all done by extreme rigktists planned irom!

very high up and that is why they had to kill OSWALD so he couldn't talk.

Julieta odds' that she hopes they will wake up & little with this business

and pay attention to what has happened because it 1s evident 1t 13 eil &

conspiracy of rightist groups and military men.

She adds that in a very

obvious way this 'Indiyidual (OSWALD) pretended he was a Communist tc

prepare the groundwork.

Cecilia belloves that he even purposely married

the Russian girl:

Juliota couments that all was very well prepared,

step by; step to blame the Communists, but that now with this (OSWALD'S

not closed, that lon the contrary, they had to open an Investigation und

that she hopes the publio will be shaken up

so that they will stop this tendency toward Fascism. Julieta continues

that at the beginning she thought lt was caused by raoial trouble but

now she thinks it is something more then that it 1s a national thing

-well planned and that OSWALD was not just aoting spontaneously. Cecilia

agrees, indeed it was i perfect shot with exact caloulation and could not

have been done spontaneously. Julieta says that his (OSWALD's) deati

was evidently to shut him up and they had botter not say how that Ruby

was at the moment emotional (when he shot OSWALD) because, Ruby is the

typo who could never be piotured asa great patrlot since he has a

criminal record. Cecillé believes that Johnson (Pres.) and all those

people are paying attention to the strenghth in this!

Juliets is sure

of this and adds that the news (pross) was redloulous in respect tò

OSWALD In that he went to marry a Russian, later was photographed with the

Dally Workers with the Communist newspaper in me hand and a Troskylat

one in the other hand, thus everything was very well prepared to blame

the leftists, indeed this basi always been the way they have done it,

commit the terroriet acts and then try to make it appear that the acts

wore done by the Commnists, that has always been the taotic and only

the poople that; have no idea about politics can swallow those things.

MEXI 7104 Amb Mann asks that following be passed to Sec. Rusk.

He presumes KUBARK und

ODENVY will be advised. Since my cable of yesterday (MEXI 7072 - para 97 above) these have

been three principal developments: 1) Amb HERNANDEZ Armas at 1839 hrs last evening 'alled

DORIICOS of Cub. In this conversation, which like the first is tared, DORIICOS exyressed

continued concern over possibility that Mexi police had interrogated Silvia about morey.

2)

ALVARADO, the Nio, 'wes questioned by CAS officer until two a.m. this morning.

officer was impressed by ALVARADO who has offered make himself available as a witness and

who is now hiding in place provided by CAS. We cannot guarentee ALVARADO's safety.

of detail ALVARADO gives about events and personalities Involved with OSWALD in Cub Emb

1s striking. 3) At 1215 hrs Mext time 27 Nov. CAS|officer was admised by phone by

ECHEVERRIA thet he had rearrested /Silvie today because he learned she was sttemptine to

leave Maxi for Habana.However, Echeverria later told LEGAT that he had decided to earrest

Silvia to avoid any possibility she might escapt to Cuba and later be unavailable a i

witness.

Since we had received no reply to yesterday's telegrem (MEXI 7072 - per. *"! above)

we have not requested Mexi gor to take'g any aotion against Silvia except to maintain

Inoreased surveillance of her activities. Echeverria later denied to LEGAT that he led any

specifie concrete evidence that she was about to leave for Cuba.

We do not now know which

Echeverria statements are accurate.

It 1s quite possible, and even probable, that contra-

diotory statements made by Echeverria ire explained by desire of GOM to play down Imcortance

of OSWALD visit here. Mexi line still 1s that OSWALD visit related solely to visa question.

Consistent with this Echeverria stated to LEGAT that DORIICOS only interested in finding

out whether Nexi authorities tried to pay a story from silvia.

This is obviously Incrorrect

Interpretetion.| Neither|LOPEZ Meteor nor Echeverria know of ALVARADO's story.

Pls rote

thet socording Icheverria Silvia is being taken to Attorney General's office to which

Mexi press has easy access. Possiblity of habeas corpus cannot be discounted.

4 12

have as yet found no trace of the red headed Cub negro described by ALVARADO, but are

continuing our search for him. 5)

Inladdition to questions raised in yesterday's telegram

Washington should urgently consider feasibility of requesting Mexi authorities to arrest

for interrogation: Furabia ACUSiLulBa CALDEROY and Alfredo MIRABAL

The two men are

Cuban nationals and Cuban consular officers.

Luisa CALDERON is a dr secretary in Culan

consulate here. In this connection artiole II of Consular Convention between U. S. and Mexi

exempts frow urrest "Consular officers, national of the state by which they are appointed,

and not engaged in any private occupation for gain" except "when charged with the carission

of an act designated by local legialution as crime other than misdemesnor and subjecting

the individual guilty thereof to punishmenti by impriscament." We are checking to see whether

all of these individuels are on current consular list.

Even assuming they are, and assuming

Direct HQ'S attent101

this transcript. Note however, KOSTIKOV has dark hair, YAISKOV light brown and very grey at

temples; giving appearance of almost white hair.

Could also well be, that OSWALD first spoke

with KOSTIKOV who turned OSWALD over to his boss YATSKOV. Also; given the apparent frankness

ofiX's discussions with LIOVAI-1, particularly hid views Stalinj and Khrushchey, would appear

possibld he told I-1 truth re OSVALD, at minimum he meeting OSWALD.

of a CSCI to the FBI reporting an incident which might be connected with the assassination.

(attachment is pata 409 below)

MEMO TO FBI FrOM WOFACT - An untested source recently furnished us with the foll info he

allegedly received from a well known Cuben solentist and acquelataace on 23 Noy 63, but |which

he had forgotten to report.

The release of the Warren Conn Report reminded him of the inci-

dent. / The solentist said he had been at the Havaha airport on afternoon of 22 Nov, 63 when

at 1700 hrs an alroraft with Mexi markings landed and parked at far side of the field.

Two men, whon he tooognized as Cuban I "gangsters"| alighted, entered rear lentrance

administration bldg and disappeared without going through normal customs procedures.

Eis

curiosity was aroused, and he was able to learn that the aircraft had just arrived from

Dallas, Texas, via IlJuana and lerd City. The plane had been forced to land at TIjuana due

to engine trouble

By combining the date, the origin of the flight, and the known reputation

of the two men, he theorized that the two men must have been involved in assassination.!

He apeculated that OSWALD had acted in the pay of castro, and that the two Cubans had been

In Dallas to orgahize or oversee the operation. He told the source that he had been greatly

distrassed by what he had seen and heard and had to telll someone about It. He then cautioned

source not to tell anyone else about it or they would in both be shot by the Cubans. /

this Subj of. 25 De6 65 - para 427 above)

Participants - Elena and Thomas (Pol Offiœr)

Elena, described sone developments which may have some bearing on her claim that she saw

SWALD at a party at none of ber cous 1

Ruben DURAN when OSWALD was in Mexico prior to

P3ass1nation.

Elena said Carlos SOLORZANO 1s well acquainted wish tub Amb HERNANDEY

mas, and that he was not leftist but his brother, Alionso, was a Communist.

Amb HE RANDDEZ

told SOLORIANO he wanted to meet Elens, so SOLORZANO arranged a party at his own "cis on

30 June 66 and Invited both of them.

Also present were Tito MONIEROSO and his wife;

Elvira VARGAS,

leftist Journalist with NOVEDADES and personal friend of Pres DIAZ Ordaz;

Emanuel CARBALLO, the pro-Castro writer; Joaquin DIAZ Canedo, head of publishing firm

called Editorial Mortiz; and Juan SORIANO, painter, who was lovited to make her feel at

ease, since he is & friend of hers and was the only anti-Communist there besides herself.

/ During evening, Amb HERNANDEZ, whom she described as intelligent and cultured, cucen-

trated his attention on her..... and expressed interest In her friend, Carlos MADR-ZO.

He issued a personal Invitation to her to attend the annual literary festival of the Casa

de las Americas In Havana,

She said she was not & Fideliste and would not go unless

Juan SORIANO went with her. Amb FERNANDEZ then Invited SORIANO but the latter denounced

the Castro rogime over the objections of the: others present...../ Iater, her friend,

Victor RICO Galan who personally dislikes Amb HERNANDEZ warned her not to go to Cuba alone.

/ On 4 July 66 a driver from the Cub Emb delivered to her home on Calle Alencastre 1n

Lomas Virreyes an envelope containing two letters and some printed matter from the Casa

de las Amerioas In Havana!

The first letter, written

as Vermont 38 and the second letter, written

une envelope-for-the first lettere With thoabove address, was marked for retum to the

sender, which was the Cub inb here.

The second, envelope, which contained

the whole pkg,

had no address as it was hand carried to her home - see attachments." / Elena stateú the

only reason the letters were addressed to her at Calle Vermont was

she spent several

days at the Hotel Vermont after the assassination.

The correct address of the hotel is

Vermont 29, 'so she concluded the Cub Gov carried that street and number, with a minor

error, as her regular address,/ Since CALVILLO had taken her to the hotel ostensitly to

protect her from the Communists, this raised the question of how the Cubans obtained that

She said that' the only people who know she had been at the Hotel Vermont were

CALVILIO and two close friends of his, Ernesto de la Poñt and Margarita MICHELENA.

Two

other friends of these three who might have learned of It are Funice ODIO and June COBB.

She i has always been suspiolous.of all three because they went out of their way to

cultivate her when she returned from Europe in 63 and made such a point of being outspoken

professional anti-Communiste.

'ah: Elona said CALVILIO was a close personal friend lof Noe

PALOMARES and Pres. DIX Ordaz, and that guards: prosumably fron Gobernacion, had been

placed outside her home when she returned from the Hotel Vernonth.:../ Elena thought It

possible that the cub Imb had deliberately given her the letters from the Casa de las

Americas fith the Yermont Street address in order to frighten her.

She was already con

cerned about what appeared to be three gunshots that had been fired through her upstairs

window while she was out of the house three weeks ago. :../ Finally, Elena said she had

recently encountered her cousin, Lydie I DURANland that the lattet had beed very friendly

and wanted to meet her again. She said lydia was very poor and had & small Job with
