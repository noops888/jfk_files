reports since 1961.

Summary.

Correspondence between the MDC In Miami and the MDC

delogation in Puerto Rico, and a letter from Enrique Villareal

de la Concepcion, MDC roprosentative in Chile, indicated a

difforence of opinion within the organization concerning the

MDC's views regarding tho Chilean Christian Democratie Party

and Eduardo Frel Montalva, President of Chile. Villareal re

signed from the MDc.;

In a letter dated 29 July 1965 to the president of the Movimiento

Democrata Christiano (MDC, Christian Domocratic Movement) in

Hiami, the Puerto Rico delegation of the MDC set forth ts

vlews

on what it considered a "conspiracy of silence" against

Christian Denocracy.

It felt that the movement was being

harmed by deliberate distortion of facts, and that the cam

paton was intensifled by. Chilean President Eduardo Frei

Montalva's trip through kurope.

The delegation took exception

to statements. about Cuba made by Frel, whom they considered

111-Informed.

The delegation did not

feel that public state

ments should

be made on this matter, but warned that Cubans

should be alert concerning Frei.

The delegation suggested

that Frei should be censured by the national executive com

mittee of the MDC.

tbe Puerto Rico delegation's concern about

hostility toward the MDC in the press,

and in political and

roligious circles, which it said was

more intense in Miami

than in Puerto RiCO.

Cho letter pointed out, however united

thore has been a noticeable chango in the attitude of

States Goverment officials toward the MDC; that the MDC is

treated with more respect and consideration. This was

attributed to the growing importance of Christian Democracy

in Intornational relations,

duo to Frei's triumph and his

/ policy of

"hemisporte transcendence."

According to the

lotter, the national oxecutive comittee of

the MDC has been

observing Frei's

actions with growing alarm.

claim that the staterents attributed to Frol concerning Cuba

are loose quotations from speeches intended for

consumption which are exaggerated

or quoted out of contert

the press.

The letter continued.

that it was not advisable

to take a publie stand against the statements attributed to

Frol as that would lead to a public debate with the PDC and

as a result would place other parties of the Christian

Denocrat Organization of America (ODCA) in a position of

having to support one or the other.

The letter said that the MDC must gather documentation on what

Frel has said and written concerning Cuba, and assigned this

task

to the Puerto Rico delegation.

This

documentation could

be studied at the next national congress, and from this

documentation it might be possible to develop a good defense

for Christian Democracy and the MDC.

It warned that this

problem must be bandied with sell control and without emotion

Followers of Batista who attended the Congress sald that they

bad formed a block

in the Organizacion Democrata Cristiano de

America (ODCA, Christian Democratic Organization of America)

with parties of other countries which agree with the stand of

the MDC on international affairs.

This bloc includes the

partles of Brazil, Peru, Venezuela and Colombia.

They plan

to compel the Chilean party aud others to take a more definite

stand against Communian and the regime of Fidel Castro Ruz.

Members of the Military Sector of the MDC met with the dele

gates to

the Congress on 29

August.

Angel Hernandez Rojo

asked that the military budget be increased from $750.00 (U.S.)

per month to $70,000 per year, and that a base be established

in Central or South America,

regardless of the distance from

Miami.

He said that the MDC bad sabotage and demolition men

and equipment ready, to operate in four provinces of Cuba,

and

that a team of frogmen,

which was completing

training In Puerto

Rico, would be ready to operate

"In a for days"

He sald that

they

could not operate from the United States because of U.s.

Customs, and that the political aituation in the Dominican

Republic

makes it impossible. to operate fron the MDC base

tbero.

to added that two-boats which vere at the base in the

Dominican Republic could not be used.

Hernandez asked that

each delegation establish a military nucleus,

and sald that

be would visit each delegation to help organize the military

element within

two months.

The members of the Puerto, Rico

delegation said

that they would raise part of tho $70,000

Democratic Movenent).

Juan Manucl Salvat Roque, loidor of the

Boyer had just

spont more than 30 days touring Central Amorican countiles 1u an

effort to make direct contact with Christian Democratic Parties

in that ares.

After his introduction, Boyor briofly cescribed the history of

the Chilaan Party fion

the day

ita rioo to povor in 1964 with tho election to the prosidency of

Eduardo Frot.

3.

During the course of tho intervior, Loyer entertained polite but

onergotic questions from various nonbors of the MDC.

asked why President Frol wantod to have commercial rolations with

the Cormunist countries, loyer nttempted to explain that tho

decision was not baged on idoology but on econonies.

He said that

Chile has a great neod for hard currency und that if the United

States can maintain cornercial rclutions with the Communist

countries; why can Chilo not do so also-

One of the DC members

remarked that by roing to such an extrere, the Chileans were

bobaving 11ke

"Soglishnon," and that it was tamoral

to establish

relationg based on such escuses.

Foyer was thon asked if he bolleved in the solidarity of

wenpons from Chile, Boyor explained that the Chilean Government

could not give such ald becauso of intornational agrucente

with other. patlons,

but that the Chilean Christian Democratic

Party could prorido this help.

He said that thie would be a

matter to be discussed by the lenders of both the Chilean and

Cúban Christian Denocratic Parties®

Boyer cobeluded by proclaiming that the United Stata approved

of

all the social reforms undortaken by Chile, and that Chile

Meanwhile, however, the

Boyer gave the impression that the

Chilean Party was concorning itself dooply with the problems
