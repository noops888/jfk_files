Rebulet to Assistant Attorney General WILLIAM F.

IOMPKINS dated September 1is

1954, and the report of SA ROLE I.

LARSON dated at Mexico, D. F., June 25, 1954.

This office has received from the

a copy of a report relating to the subject dated uctober 20,

1954, which was accompanied by a number of photographic copies

be in Guatemala

and that he claims to have participated actively in the success-

ful revolutionary undertaking of Colonel CARLOS CASTILLO ARMAS

In Guatemala. Since it is presumed that the Bureau will have

received the above-mentioned report and its accompanying photo-

graphs, no effort is being made by this office to duplicate and

furnish them to the Bureau, UACB.

MANUEL EDUARDO CABALLERO, confidential contact and

Costa Ricar revolutionary who participated in the CASTILLO ARMAS

overthrow of the ARBENZ regime, has advised that information

available to him fails to indicate that BROWDER actually partici-

pated in the CASTILLO ARMAS revolution as he claims. CABALLERO

is presently in Guatemala City, however, in the company of former

Costa Rican President RAFAEL CALDERON GUARDIA and, since they

expect to be in contact with Guatemalan President CASTILLO ARMAS

and other high officials of his administration,

CABALLERO has

stated they will make inquiry concerning the subject in an effort

to determine whether or not he is in Guatemala and whether or not

he furnished arms for and/or participated in the Guatemalan

revolution.

The Bureau will be advised of the information obtained

by CABALLERO upon his return

to Mexico City.
