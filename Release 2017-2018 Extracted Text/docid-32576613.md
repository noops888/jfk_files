TODDO MARINO, true name SALVATORE GAETANO MAIORANO,

FBI# 1644357, who was mentioned by It. JACOBS, is an

influential member of the GENOVESE

"family" who hangs out

at 20th Street and 5th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY.

RUDY (LNU) and DOM PRADO are not sufficiently

identified at this time.

Also mentioned in referenced airtels is the name

JACK LEVINIA (PH), who is apparently a partner with GAETANO

"CORKY" VASTOLA in an illegal alcohol operation.

LEVINIA

is probably identical with JOHN LIVIGNO, NYCPD B# 164755,

age 61, ATTD# 4088. LIVIGNO is also known as JACK LIVIGNY and

JACK LEVINE.

LIVIGNO's' last known residence was 8701 Shore

Road, Brooklyn, NY.

LIVIGNO was described in 1960 by ATTD agents as the

top moonshiner on the East Coast.

He was arrested in 1954 for

running a 1000 gallon still on the Brooklyn waterfront and

pleaded guilty on 2/19/60, EDNY, Brooklyn, and sentenced

along with his brother, MORRIS LIVIGNO, to 2 years imprison-

ment.

Another moonshiner sentenced with LIVIGNO was

GIOACHINO "LAUNDRY JACK" MENTESANO.

It should be noted that NY 3586-C-TE has associated,

with LIVIGNO in the past and will be discreetly contacted

concerning the locationa LIVIGNO's present operation.
