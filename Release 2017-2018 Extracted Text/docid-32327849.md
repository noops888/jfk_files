ADMINISTRATIVE:

On 11/23/64, NY 3936-C advised SA WILLIAM A.

VERICKER that he had received information that SALLY BURNS

is attempting to settle some difficulties in NY for JAMES

HOFFA.

The informant advised that he had been told that

HOFFA is in trouble with the "wise guys" in NY and if

GRANELLO is able to settle this situation, he will be able

to obtain anything he desires from HOFFA.

The informant was

unable to pinpoint the source of HOFFA's trouble.

The informant further statedthat on 11/20/64,

BURNS met with TONY PROVENZANO in an endeavor to negotiate

some loans from the Teamsters Pension Fund. However, in

the event that any positive action is taken relative

to these

proposed loans, PROVENZANO will not handle the loans for

GRANELLO.

The informant advised that he also received

information that on 11/13/64, BURNS was supposed to pay

'an

unidentified individual in Nassau County the sum of $25,000

to "fix" the current extortion case pending against BURNS

in Nassau County, NY.

however, the informant

added that

GRANELLO was only able to raise $10,000 of this sum and

would pay off that amount of money.

NY 3936-C was unable

to ascertain the source of this sum of money.

In view of the sensitive nature of the afore-

mentioned data and the strong possibility that the informant

might be compromised should this information be disseminated,

this data has not been included in the details of instant

report.

The files of the Newark Division fail to

reflect any information relative to SAM MARIA and EDWARD

COOPER.

JOSEPH. LATTUCCA is the subject of the case entitled,

"UNKNOWN SUBJECTS (2); JOSEPH LATTUCCA; LOUIS PAOLINI;

WILLIAM STEWART WEATHERELL-VICTIM; ITAR-EXTORTION-CONSPIRACY",

(Newark file 166-317; NY file 166-714).
