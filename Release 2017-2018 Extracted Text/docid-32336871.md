While it is entirely possible that the Bureau has

already furnished material to San Antonio concerning the

following, it is desired to suggest that the subject be inter-

viewed along the lines set forth below in the event this has

not already been done.

(us

Subject arrived in Madria from Cuba by air on

7-16-60 and remained in Madrid until 7-20-60, when he departed

for Brussels, Belgium, by air. At that time

he was traveling

on Cuban diplomatic passport 59/927 issued on 12-28-59. Accord-

ing to information received from Cuban sources, subject while

in Madrid held lengthy conversations with

Colonel RAMON BARQUIN

LOPEZ, who was residing in Madrid at that time and who headed

à

Cuban Arms Purchasing Commission in Europe.

(s (4)

As the Bureau is aware, Colonel BARQUIN, who had spent

time in jail during the BATISTA regime for plotting against the

latter and who was roleased by CASTRO on 1-1-59, allegedly def

fected from the CASTRO government in about August 1960 and

thereatter pracsoded from Madrid to Miami, where he is believed

to be residing at the present time. It is felt that it would

be worthwhile to thoroughly interview the subject regarding.

BARQUIN and the nature of the subject's conversations with him

in Madrid, it being noted that Cuban sources of the Madrid Office

have been critical of the delay of BARQUIN in defecting from the

CASTRO government and have expressed the opinion that his de-

fection occurred only after he had been fired by CASTRO.

Madrid subject also had conversations withrone

Paris letter of 1-11-61 in instant case transmitted

to the Bureau a summary memorandum in the French language of

the organization known as the, Directorio Revolucionaria Iberic

de Liberacion PRIL, Iberian-Revolutionary Directorate for

Liberation)

This summary memorandum was received by the Paris

Office from JULIEN'VERNIMMEN of the Belgian Security Service.

It is in the process of being translated at the Bureau at the Belaud

present time, and the Bureau has furnished the Madrid and Paris

Offices with portions of the translation. It is noted that this

translation sets forth considerable information on the subject

and

on individuals identified with the activities of the DRIL,

most of the information having been obtained as a result of the

arrest of subject and several other persons in August 1960 in

Belgium. It is suggested that if it has not already been done,

a copy of the available translation to date of the summary

memorandum be furnished to the San Antonio Office for use

in

with its interviews of the subject.

5)

It is noted that among other persons, the memorandum

mentions one JOSE VELO, described as a resident of Venezuela..

a good contact man of the DRIL, and the chairman.

This person

is believed to be identical with JOSEYVELO MOSQUERA, One Of the

leaders of the group which assaulted the ss

46 years of age and fled Spain some years ago because of his

political activities.

He was supposedly the "political chief"

" Of the assailants of the "Santa María"

Despite subject's

previous denial of any knowledge of the "Santa María" plot,

it is believed that he should be reinterviewed concerning JOSE

VELO MOSQUERA and his knowledge of the activities of the DRIL.

Also mentioned in the translation of the summary

memorandum is one

Madrid and a Cuban national.

• This person was definitely im-

plicated by the Spanish Police in the placing of several bombs

in Madrid in February 1960.

He was successful in escaping

back into France, and according to the sunmary memorandum had (5)

apparently been in contact with other DRIL representatives in (S]

Belgium.

It is believed that the name of SANTIAGO MARTINEZ DONOSO

was an assumed one.

It is suggested that subject be interviewed

for any information he may have concerning the true identity of

this person.

Apart from the above specific points, it is suggested

that subject be thoroughly questioned regarding his knowledge

of any and all activities being planned against the present

governments of Spain and Portugal.

It is noted that there are

some indications that there will be a build up in such activities

and any background information the subject can furnish would be

of considerable value.

Two extra copies of this letter are attached for

forwarding by the Bureau

to the San Antonio Office.
