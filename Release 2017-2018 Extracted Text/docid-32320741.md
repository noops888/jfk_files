Released under the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (44 USC 2107 Note).

DATE: 11-14-2017

September 13, 1995

Howard:

The attached letter to the Director, (Hartingh's opened

copy attached), delivered yesterday from the JFK Review Board,

advises of determinations to disclose reco..ds.

A seven-day

period for appeal to the President exists, per this letter.

details of the documents at issue have been set forth in John A.

Hartingh to William E. Baugh, Jr., memorandum dated 9/6/95, which

recommended against appeal but that CID and NSD advise you if

they recommend appeal.

The Task Force has been advised that CID deferred to

NSD because the records at issue relate to their work and that

NSD recommends against appeal.

The only difference between Hartingh's memo and the

attached letter is that the Board did not address document #6 in

Hartingh's memo as the Board has apparently tabled that document

instead of ordering it released.

With this change, CIA advises

they do not plan to appeal the

release of their information in

FBI documents, but they will advise the FBI by formal letter

within the rene an ee mo th a 1na, ga 05 m 9l/20

we may assist you

further in this matter.

William E. Baugh, JK.
