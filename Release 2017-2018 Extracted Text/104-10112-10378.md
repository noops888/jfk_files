quired U. S. citizenship in 1942. His mother was naturalized a U. S.

5. The French citizenship of Subject's brother and father-in-

law is not believed to preclude SI consideration in view of Subject's

limited association with them. Subject's former relationship with Monique

Veber and the possible involvement of her family in Communist activity

are not believed to bar SI consideration in the absence of information

indicating his former relatives could constitute a source of pressure. It

is recommended, therefore, that:

A. No objection be interposed to Subject's clearance for

SI information

B. OCI be advised of the information concerning Subject's

foreign relatives.
