9 April 1971

HEMORANDUM FOR: Special Assistant to DDO for

External Oversight

FROM

â€¢ Jackson R. Hortor

Chief, Domestic Collection Divisior

SUBJECT

: Joseph Raymond Merola

DCD's only recorded contact with Joseph Raymond Merola

prior to August 1961 occurred on 6 February 1961.

It followed

a series of telephone calls over a period of several months

in which Merola had expressed interest in offering his assis-

tance in connection with

Cuban matters.

The DCD officer had

declined contact until 6 February when Merola claimed to have

information on a Brazilian senator who was a "close friend

and confidante" of "Che" Guevera. Because Guevera was the

subject of requirezents levied on DCD, our officer agreed to

a meeting.

The substance of the 6 February 1961 meeting is

described

in report 0J-A(S)-3179213, dated & February.

(This

report has been returned to the Agency Archives, but will be

retrieved and reviewed for classification.

Should it carry a

"Secret" classification,

it will be downgraded to "Confidential"

and may be so considered for the purposes of this inquiry.

If the following deletions are made, I have no

objection to the release of this document.

a. Heading: "Support"

b. Paragraph 2: Delete the first sentence

c. Paragraph 4: Delete "Sam Kay"

d.

Signature: Delete "Justin F. Gleichauf"
