od the AlLisH group, Including AWHIP-1 mentioned the following

sigaificant points:

KUBARK was criticized for "fooling around lo1

years" without helping and for jeopardizing the operation;

be highly embarrassing to KuBaRk.

At issue are two basic

points, the knowledge on the part of UNSNAFU-19 about EUBARK'S

connection with AMHIP 1 and the charge that AWHIP-1 has been

defrauding KUBARK in the jewelry transaction. Also to be Lept

in mind is the fact that ODENVY has an offico inl
