tion that CHERRY, a well-known Dallas police character who

was recently released from prison, was in possession of a

large amount of money orders and had recently made a trip to

Phoenix, Ariz. and Kansas City, Mo. where he disposed of

some

of these.

On 9/11/62, while discussing this information with

Det: STRINGFELLOW, Dallas PD, he advised that in late July

a postal sub-station in the Cockrell Hill section of Dallas

had been burglarized and a large amount of postal money orders

stolen.

contacted and furnished the above information.

advised that the Harris Food Store, 4131 West

Jefferson, wherein

a postal sub-station is located, was burglarized the night of

7/20-21/62 and 1550 blank money orders were stolen.

Subsequently

some of these money orders were cashed at Colorado

Springs,

Colo., Topeka, Kansas, and Atlanta and Decatur, Ga., by a

tall

slender individual.

It should be noted that CHERRY is

tall and slender and meets the description as furnished by

ARMSTRONG.

ARMSTRONG requested that the CI be contacted for

further details if possible and this was done on 9/12 and 13/62.

At that time CI advised that he was receiving his information

frOm JOE HOWARD LINTICUM, Dallas PD #32599. LINTHICUM had

told CI that approximately 4 weeks previously CHERRY had left

Dallas with the money orders and had stolen LINTHICUM's girl

friend, HAZEL IVY. IVY had accompanied CHERRY to Phoenix and

Tv nare

then to Kansas City where she ran away from him and returned

to Dallas. LINTHICUM also told CI that he had taken IVY to

Atlanta, Ga. six or seven weeks ago to visit JOE HERBERT HOSKINS

at the Federal penitentiary.

Informant also advised that one

of CHERRY's close associates who also had some of the money

orders, was a man named GUINN REED. Above information furnished

to ARMSTRONG on 9/12 and 13/62 and ARMSTRONG stated it fit in

perfectly with the informationthe postal inspectors had developed

to date.

mation and was of the opinion that a case could possibly be

made against CHERRY and REED based on the above information.
