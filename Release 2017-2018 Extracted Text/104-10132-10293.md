an incident which occurred in the security Records Division

file room relating to the OSWALD security files.

was subsequently interviewed by the undersigned and Jerry

Brown, Deputy Chief, Security Analysis Group, on 23

March

1977 in the Security Analysis Group, Room 3E49, and

frelated substantially the following.

2. Sometine between May 1975 and January 1976 while

an Office of Security employee assigned to the Security

Records Division file room,l

was requested to

search SANCA in the name of Lee Harvey OSWALD. This request

was in connection.with a Freedom of Information case involving

OSWALD, and

believed that

assigned to the Security Kecords Division,

n, made the reauest.

This search met with positive

results, thus making

ware of the fact that OSWALD's name was entered in SANCA.

3. Subsequently. L

I came across a file which

he described as relating to OSWALD, and he intended to file

same with the rest of the OSWALD files on the shelf.

described this file as covert, thin, and having a

higher file number than the rest of

the OSWALD holdings.

He could not remember the name which appeared on the outside

of the file but thought that it may have been one of OSWALD's

akas. He further related that he looked inside the file and

believed that it was related to, or possibly identical with

the regular OSWALD holdings. While attempting to refile this

covert file, he observed that all of the regular OSWALD

holdings were permanently charged to the Security Analysis

Jroup: thus

believes he sent the covert file to the

Security Analysis Group.
