explained that on August 6, 1962, he received

the urine of lourine sent to him by. Professor Niehans, of

the clinic "La Prairiel at Clarens, Canton Waadt, for

examination purposes. From the letter it could be gathered

that Tourine lodged at Hotel Palace, in Lausanne, and that

his home address was Miami Beach, USA., Causeway Street 79.

Dr. Abderhalden does not know Tourine personally and he

cannot remember having talked to him at the phone. Nestine

Joseph and his wife are not known to him either. Dr. Abderhalden

is a worla famous medical practioner and he has never come

to the attention of the police.

The phone number 2 13 09 belongs
