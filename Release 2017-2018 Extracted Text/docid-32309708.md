MASFERRER, on February 25, 1960, said that MARQUEZ STERLING

is now the political leader, and that Colonel SANCHEZ MOSQUERA

will soon become the military leader, because the "Batistianos"

fear General PEDRAZA's ambitions, and the ex-"FIDELISTAS" and

Authentic Party will not accept PEDRAZA.

INTERNAL SECURITY - CUBA

SynopaliThere are about 70,000 Cuban nationals in Miami.

There

have been clashes between pro and anti-CASTRO groups.

There are four anti-CASTRO organizations in Miami and

ADC, CCC, MAOC, and MCA are in Miami.

OCANY and WHITE ROSE are in New York. In 1959 NUNEZ

PORTUONDO was considered political leader of the

opposition groups.

In December, 1959, GeneralOTRUJILDO

of Dominican Republic and WILLIAM D. PAVLEY Of Miami

reportedly said they would support a junta to govern

Cuba. PORTUONDO threatened to retire from movement.

There were subsequent meetings in United States to

establish unity of opposition groups, but no indication

that a junta was established.

Leading individuals are:

NUNEZ PORTUONDO, FERNANDEZ MIRANDA, MASFERRER ROJAS,

PIEDRA NEGUERUELA, BOSQUE CUETO, ALIEGRO MILA, DIAZ

LANZ, and General PEDRAZA. GARCIA NAVARRO and FREYRE

AGUILERA do not expect invasion of Cuba by movement

without United States support. Base in Dominican

Republic reportedly has about 1,000 European mercenaries

and 100 Cubans.

PAUL JOSEPH HUGHES, MATT DUKE, and (FNU)

PINKSTON believed involved in bombing missions over Cuba.

and pamphlets.
