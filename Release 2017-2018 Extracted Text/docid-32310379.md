ReLhairtols 1/19/62 and 2/1/62; Buairtels 1/25/62 and

2/5/62; and Statrtel 2/6/62.

In view of the request by Department attorney Charles S.

Smith, the St. Louis Office is authorized to have two mature,

experienced Special Agents interview Richard I. Kavner immediately.

This interview must be well-planned by the Agents

assigned to conduct same and they must be thoroughly familiar

with

all the details of this matter.

If at all possible, Kavner

should be intervieved away from his place of employment or his

home; in any event care and caution must be exercised to insure

that

the interview is not overheard or recorded.

In addition,

the interview must be conducted in such a manner so as not to

reveal any information in Burean files and so that Kavner will

not become aware that LA 4381-PC and LA-4350-C have furnished

information to us in this case.

Should Kavner request that an attorney be present during

the interview,

you are to be guided by instructions as set forth

on page 1SC of

the FBI Handbook.

The interview with Kavner should be confined to captionea

matter.

I, however, upon being interviewed he indicates a

recoptive,

cooperative attitude and volunteers information

Tolson

pertaining to other matters same should, of course, be accepted.

RE:

JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA; EARL SCHEIB; ET AL.

63-7112

Bear in mind that LA-4350 -C has repeatedly advised Los Angeles

that Kavner is disgruntied with the Teamsters Union and has

tried to resign. Any such indication during the interview should

be capitalized upon to the fullest extent possible, as

Kavner undoubtedly could become a very valuable source of

information should he see fit to do so.

Handle this matter immediatoly on a TOP PRIORITY

basis and surad or airtel the same

day the interview is conducted

setting forth a succinct summary of the results.

NOTE:

Kavner is an international organizer of the Teamsters

Union who reportedly works directly under both Hoffa and Harold J.

Gibbons, Executive Vice-President of the Teamsters Union.

LA 4350-C

former Teamsters Union official OTHER 4

in Los Angeles,

California, who is furnishing information to

Los Angeles Office on a confidential basis) has repeatedly

advised that Kavner is extremely disgruntled with the Teamsters

Union and has been trying to resign.

Within the last few

weeks Kavner contacted LA 4350-C and requested his aid in

seeking other employment so he could

resign. LA 4350-C

feels Kavner is "ripe for interview."

Kavner, according to LA 4350-C, was instrumental in

effecting the transfer of Earl Scheib's contract with the

United Automobile Workers of America to the Teamsters Union.

Interview with Kavner is a logical investigative

step and the Department has now requested that he be interviewed.

ReBuairtels 1/25/62 and 2/5/62 and Los Angeles

airtel 2/1/62.

on 2/6/62 HERBERT MORISSE, JR., Assistant Vice

President, Southwest Bank, St. Louls, Mo., whose identity should

remain confidential, stated the Teamsters Union in st. Louis has

numerous accounts at the bank. A number of union employees of

the Teamsters Union, including RICHARD I. KAVNER, have loans here.

MORISSE has regular contact with CHARLES E. ROCKENMEYER, 'employed

by the Teamsters, who brings in deposits, signature caras, payments

on loans by officials, etc. On 2/6/62 ROCKENMEYER stated KAVNER

has been out of town but was expected back in the office very soon.

He stated that after a few days KAVNER will leave again on union

business. He indicated KAVNER is still employed by the Teamsters

and gave no intimation of possible resignation.

On 2/6/62 Mrs. RICHARD I. KAVNER was contacted by

phone under pretext of being an old friend of her husband from the

East employed by another union and passing through St. Louis.

Mrs. KAVNER said he had just returned to town but expected to leav

on business

"soon."

She said he might be contacted at MO 4-9800

(It will be noted

this is the phone number of Teamsters Joint

Council No. 13 and 11 locals all quartered at 1641 S. Kingshighway

St. Louis, Mo.). Mrs. KAVNER was specifically asked if her hus-

band is still

St. Louis files contain no recent information con-

cerning KAVNER's possible resignation.

They do not indi-

cate any prior contact with KAVNER by Special Agents of

this office.

SL 1130-C advised SA HOWARD C. KENNEDY on 2/1/62

and 2/2/62 he has no information re any change of KAVNER's

status as a Teamster employee.

Inasmuch as the suggestion for interview stems

from

KAVNER's possible defection and since our inquiry does not

substantiate this, St. Louis does not recommend interview.

dated 1/25/62.

Re Bureau airtel to SACs, Los Angeles, and St. Louis,

This case was discussed at length with Mr. CHARLES

SMITH, Departmental Attorney at a conference held 1/31/62, con-

cerning the HOFFA cases presently being handled by the Los

Angeles Division.

In regard to this matter, Mr. SMITH requested

that RICHARD KAVNER be interviewed. He was

advised that st.

Louis was at this time, attempting to ascertain if KAVNER has

resigned from, and is disgruntled with the Teamsters Union.

Mr. SMITH said he desires to have KAVNER interviewed at this time

even if he, KAVNER, is of is not still associated with the

Teamsters Union.

He feels that KAVNER, having handled the trans-

fer SCHEIB Workers from the IWFL, Local 886, to the Teamsters

Union, is the key to this case,

and if KAVNER is willing to

furnish information, he could also be the key to many other

matters concerning the lasters and HOPFA.
