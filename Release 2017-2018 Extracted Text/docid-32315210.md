15. Remarks:

Miami has completed the survey of the COSTELLO residence.

This is a large luxurious home located in a prosperous

section of Nörth Miami. Survey revealed that most

logical area for coverage would be the florida room

adjacent to the swimming pool. This installation can be

accomplished only after considerable technical wörk in-

volving changing of drop wire and approximately 100 feet

of staczon wite which runs through crawl space in acete

and through bedroons. This wire will have to be painted

to match cuzzent color schene.

In addition, outside

station wire will also have to be replaced.

Remarks:

(Continued)

will be contingent upon the Miami Office being able to

successfully change the wire and the laboratory developing

an altered 404 jack.

The Miami Office believes that it is probable that BRUNO

will come to Miami again this season.

In view of his

importance in Criminal Intelligence Program, it is

recommended that Bureau authorize this installation.
