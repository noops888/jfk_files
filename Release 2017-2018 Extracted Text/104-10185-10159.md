Draft of Dispatch

1. LICOOKY-I has been terminated effective I July 1966.

The last meeting with her was held on 23 June. She was

paid her salary through 30 June, her income tax refund

for the period 1 January 1965 - 30 June 1966 and given

money fur one-way air fare to New York City. She vas

completely satisfled with the financial terms of the

scttletent. A Termination Secrecy Oath, signed in true

name, wag

obtained.

2. L-l plans to return to New York on or about 1 July. She

said she will look for a jot there, and is confident she

will have no difficulty obtaining one. Ste does not yet

know where she will be living.

3. L-l is subletting the apartment she occuples here. She

has purchased the KUBARK-owned household effects which

had been loaned to her for that apartment. For this

reason, In addition to the fact that she has acquired

many close friends and interests here as a result of five

years residence, the Station expects that she will return

to Mexico, although she insists she has no plans to do

4.

She was siven a post office box address to use to contact

the Station in the event that she does return to Mexico

and feels It necessary to do so..

But no conmittment mas

made to her regarding any future contact or payment for

1n formation.

5. She was previously told that the telephone number of the

New York KUBARK office is listed in the directory and

she could call that office li contact were necessary while

she was in the United States. She asked if that would

still be the case and was told that it was but only to

attempt such contact for an important or urgent matter.

But since she tends to liberally apply importance to a

wide variety of events and subjects, and since she 1s

likely to be short of money shortly after arriving, 1t

would not be surprising if she did try to egtablish such

contact.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH Division

SUBJECT

: Request for Termination of Project LICOOKY

The LICOOKY Project was last approved for the period

1 January 1965

through 31 December 1965 for S5.140--$2,530

for FY 1965 and $2.610 for FY 1966.

It is requested that

the LICOOKY Project be terminated effective l January 1966,

based on the following information geared to the outline

in CSI-F NO. 230-60.

(1) Project Name: LICOOKY

(2) Original Project Objectives:

Identify and report

on pians, dotivitics and associotes of Central

American

Communists resident in or visiting Mexico

City.

(3)

Reason for Termination:

LICOOK'-l lost her access

to the hard core group

of CA cornunists partly

because of her close association with LINLUCK who

publicly renounced his break with the Guatemalan

CP in 1962.

The loss of access was also partly

due to Inl's own apparent indiscretion vis-a-vis

some of ier close triends in Mexico City.

can be attributed both to her ow! growing distaste

for the grubby and blindly unreasoning nembers

of

this group with

asked to consort.

and

her reaction in her social group mich took the

tora increasingly of anti-Communist remarks, and

to the concomitant (or possibly resultant) rumors

uf increasing currency, that she zas in the pay

of PESWING.

Attempts were made to take advantage

of her connections with literary circles in

Mexico, but her inability to budget her time

sufficiently to satisfy station requirements led

to the decision to terminate her.

A contributing

cause was also her inability to reguiarize her

status in Mexico so che could accept a paying

position which would give her reason to remain

there: with the resultant stramn.of the thin

lecond that her sather was providing her support.

During the post-project period of asso-

ciation, after termination notice was already

given, she began to be more attentive to Station

requirements and supplied several rather detailed

profiles of controversial persons in the intellec-

tual world who could be of operational interest

to the Station.

Date of Termination: 1 January 1966

Status of commitments:

a.

LICOOKY-1: This Contract Agent is being

carried under LIRANCH (00A)

through June 1966 to prepare special reports

against non-LICOOKY Project objectives.

Termination costs will be borne by Project

LIRANCH.

b.

LTCOOKY-2:

LICOOKY-2 was terminated on 31

December 1965 for lack of continuous produc-

of the termination and recognized that his

Disposition of funds, material and personnel:

1966.

fare from Mexico City to New York and pald the

income tax refund due her.

Station owns some of

the furnishings in her apartment and she has

expressed a wish to purchase some of these.

The

normal three-bid process will be complied with in

this case, through her advertising the sale and

then offering slightly higher prices for the-items.

She plans to retain the apartment in Nerico and

sublet it furnished so she will have a pied-a-terre

whenever she returns there.

Her specific plans

for leaving the city are not known.

LICOOKY Project Approval

ACTION REQUIRED. REFERENCES

Reference: HMMA 24990

1. The LICOOKY project outline submitted with

reference

approved on 5 March 1965 for $5,140; $2,530, for FY 1965

and $2,610 for FY 1966.

Headquarters believes that in order to justify retention

of LICOOKY-1 and the projcct, the Station must determine what

information of use to. KUBARK she has access

to, and then explit

this to the fullest.

Requirements have been

for information on Central American exiles and revolutionaries,

in Mexico, their contacts with other revolutionary

groups and with the Cuban/Soviet/Satellite representatives, and

clandestine movemeat of arms to these groups.

these groups, such as LICOOKY and LINLUCK used to report, still

holds a high priority among the collectich requirements,

believe that the LICOOKY Project through proper exploitation of

1ts assets, can be a valuable source of positive and CE intelligence.

In viow of LICOOKY-l's background, including her emotional

vacillation

and potential susceptibility to leftist orientation,

we still believe

it is wise to handle her with care, and to avoid

exposing to her sensitive information on KUBARK operations,

and objectives.

We believe that the Station can

work within

the present 0A restrictions.

If, however, you feel that you are

unnecessarily encumbered with the present restrictions, and have

reason to believe that more valuable intelligence can be obtained

through a lifting of the present restrictions,

please so advise us.

4:

Headquarters is looking forward to better intelligence

and operational reporting on this project, both in quantity and

quality.

SUBJECT

: LICOOKY

project for $5,140 is directed against

Central American communists and pro-communists in Mexico,

the only project Mexico has to cover this target.

is a well-known, controversial U.S. bohemian

at one time close to

the Castro Government and now resides in

Mexico where she has good contacts with Central American

LICOOKY-2 is a lexican travel agency employee

recruited by LICOOKY-l in 1963 and then turned over to another

lexico asset for handling.

His agency is used by a Central

American Communist living in Mexico to arrange travel for

other Central Americans transitting Mexico.

2. LICOOKY-1 has excellent access to important targets

but her usefulness to us is quite limited because of a

restriction

in her clearance that she not be exposed to

sensitive KUBARK operational interests.

This means that

the levying of rejuirements has to be carefully re-

stricted, and the result has been very low production in

year (about live reports).

The main reasons for

the clearance restriction are her

erratic personal behavior

and noi-too-strong ideological orientation.

tine authority has been granted to use her in developing a

suspected KGB official from Brazil who is expected to

visit

Mexico

shortly.

Since this is

one of the most sensitive opera-

tional targets

of KUBARK,

the restrictions on giving her

requirements about Central American communists in Mexico

seens pointless.

contacts in the leftist

U.S. colony in Mexico but again, because of the clearance

restrictions, no efforts have been made to develop her

reporting capacitics along these lines.

Since this is more

sensitive, it might be well to keep her out of this area

but certainly the Central American target could be opened up

Perhaps the Desk could get a relaxation

of CI/OA restrictions on this point.

2

Because of her past relations with KUBARK (extending

back to 1960) and her past close personal relationship with

LINLUCK, her retention on the KUBARK payroll is somewhat of

aholding operation, although it is not clear that there is

any fixed holding period in mind.

It is recommended that

the Station be queried on its long-term plans for her use

and that this be clearly

indicated

in next year's renewal

request.

Other factors to be considered would be the security

problems encountered in maintaining contact with her and the

expenditure of valuable case officer time on an asset whose

reporting is

minimal at present.

Subject to the above recommendati ons,

approval of

this project

is recommended.

During the time she spent in Cuba and Latin America she has dezonstrated that mazy

of these lertists will talk fairly freely vith her.

A good deal of this information

has been found to be of intelligence interest to ODYOKE.

Her cover is simply that

of a bohenian American expatriate who does free-lance writing as veli as translations

for some outstending Latin Anerican authors.

She is motivatei to a certain extent

by her nationality but her principal notivation 16 probably financial, since she is

almost entirely dependent on her KUBARK salary nt least for her regular income.

She is witting that she is working for KUBARK.

She has received no formal training.

b. LICOOKY-2 (formerly LICENTU), & young lexican nale feld agent, is

employed by a Mexico City travel agency which is used by a Certral American Communist

agent to arrange travel from Mexico to Eastern Buropean countries.

He was originally

spotted by LICOOKY-l in August 1963 and recruited by Sinon D. CLACETT.

His

principal reports have concerned communist travelers from Central America going to

Iron Curtain countries. He has been paid on a pieceneal basis averaging $1000.00

pesos a month. He has an ('A granted on 10 February 1904. He has natural cover as

a travel agency employee.

While his motivation is chiefly finercial, he does appear

to be sympathetic to POPRIE and the policies of ODYOKE.

His need for money crestes

& financial control over him and for what it is werth the Station has signed

revelpto for money paid to him. He has had no foimal training.

2. Mechanisms:

Not Applicable.

E. Security Evaluation:

LICOOKY-l has on occesion been accused of being a KUbARK agent but these

accusations have never been pursued and they have not appeared to hinder her in

her access to her target.

Her apparent erotional Instability creates a degree of

security risk. Her intinate relations with LINLUCK have also caused Station sone

discomfort from time to tine.

lowever in recent months the two have been living

apart, thus reducing consideraoly the security factor fron this cause.

neitner LInüCK nur LICOOiY-1 1s offclully aware of the other's contact with

ODYOKE, it would be illusory; in view of their latimacy to beileve that LICCOKY-l

does not at least know LINLUCK is in contact with sore ODYOKE agency.

is less certain of her contact with HUBARK, as he has several tises pointed out

how useful she could be to KUBARK or. Central American Communists in Mexico.

l. Approval 18 requested of the ICOCKY Project for the period

1 Januory 1965 through 31 December 1965 for a total of $5,140.00;

$2,530 Pos FY 1965 and 72,610 for F: i9ó6. Funde ars available

within the Division.

This project covers the only two Mexico City agents specif-

Ically targeted agalast Central American revolutionary and subversive

While these two agents bad an operational

relationship in 1903, they have been completely separated since that

time, and are handled independently by the LInK Unit. They are

covered by this projact bacause of their coumon objectives.

Prior to their turnover to LILINK they were handled by U.8. cutouts.

LICOOKY -1 1s au Averican citisen who formerly held & posi-

tion vithin the CASTRO bierarchy; she bas excellent contacts not

only among pro-CASTRO Cubans, but also anong all Central American

leftist merolutionary groups, especially the Guatemalans. Despite

these excellent contacts, and her williagnees to accept spy assign-

ment whatsoever, there 1e little active direction of her activity

due to a restriculon on her dA which was grasted 27 January 1964.

As a result of various assessments it is bellered she must be

handled with caution because of emotional vacillation and potential

susceptibility to leftist indoctrination. The Station 16 restricted

to debriefing ber and revealing as little classified information,

Including requiresents, as possible. Her O1 vas amended on 26 Juno

1964 to authorize her use on a one-time basis as an access agent

against a Soviet newspaperman who vill be visiting Mexico and who

has been a target for defection at anotbar Wi Station. It 18

hoped to use her under this amended Od in the near future, as the

Soviet 10 now making plans to visit sexico.

4. LICOOKY 2, a travel agency employee, la believed to provide

almost complete coverage of travel by Costs Ricans, and alnost all

coverage of Ricaraguan leftists, to the USSR and the Bloc countries.

This travel Inforsation also contributes to the ZRKNICK program.
