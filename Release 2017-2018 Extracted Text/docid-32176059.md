Enclosed are the original and one copy of a

memorandum responding to your memorandum of March 24, 1978,

concerning Willem Oltmans and a "General" Donald A. Donaldson.

For your additional information, a search of FBI

Headquarters'

(FBIHQ) files shows that Oltmans,

a free-lance

Dutch journalist, is known to have associated with George

De Mohrenschildt and to have advised a news reporter that

De Mohrenschildt claimed to have been responsible for

Lee Harvey Oswald's actions.

FBIHQ's files do not confirm this

assertionilies" concocted by Oltmans are "horrible."

A relative of De Mohrenschildt has advised the

FBI that

FBIHQ's files further indicate that a Dimiter Adamoff

Dimitroff, also known as

â€¢ Dimitris Danopoulos, Diko Dikoff,

Dimitrois A. Dimitrof, D. Dimitrion, Dimitros A. Dimitriou,

is known to the FBl. In response to a

Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) inquiry, on October 28, 1977,

the Bureau advised the CIA that Dimitroff

had once allegedly

claimed he was doing work for the FBI but that we had no

record of such employment, that a General Dico Dimitrov

Donaldson,

known to the los Angeles Office of Inmigration and Naturalization

Service under its number A12594316, and that records of the

Denver, Colorado,

FBI Office reflected that Donald Donaldson

alias of Dimitroff, who used that name in dealing with

at least one of his victims in a fraudulent scheme.
