The FD-302 reflecting interview ANTONIO PEREZ

CASADA is maintained in File 2-312-202.

Inasmuch as future activities of HEMMING appear

likely to be in connection with the Interpen organization,

the Miami subject file on HEMMING is being placed in a

closed status.

One copy of this report has been designated for

Los Angeles for information, as HEMMING originated in the

Los Angeles area, his family still is there, and he may

logically be expected to return there some time in the future.
