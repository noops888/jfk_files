1. ACTION REQUIRED: PLEASE SEE PARA 6.

IN SUPPORT OF<JFK ASSASSINATION>REVIEW BOARD EFFORTS,

IS WILLING TO ATTEMPT RECONTACT OF (LITAMIL/9 (T/9) TO OBTAIN

INFORMATION REQUESTED REF A

HOWEVER, PLEASE NOTE THAT,

B PARA 3 IS IDENTICAL TO (T/9

I HE IS AGING AND POSSIBLY EVEN

THE ONLY FEASIBLE LOCATION FOR RECONTACT WILL BE HIS

HOME, WHERE HE APPARENTLY LIVES WITH THE FEMALE WHO ANSWERED THE

PHONE DURING 26 MAR 98 PRETEXT CALL, AND WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT WE

WILL BE ABLE TO MEET ALONE WITH HIM.

IN ADDITION,

BELIEVES THAT TO THOROUGHLY ANSWER ALL

OF REF A QUESTIONS, THE OFFICER CONDUCTING THE RECONTACT SHOULD

IDENTIFY HIMSELF AS A USG EMPLOYEE AND EXPLAIN THE VERY REAL

POSSIBILITY THAT 72'3 NAME WILL BE EXPOSED IN AN UPCOMING

*DECLASSIFICATION OF DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE<JEK ASSASSINATION. >

ASSUMING THAT CTOROCKAWAY COMMITTED ITSELF TO KEEPING(I/'S NAME AND

COROCKAWAY RELATIONSHIP SECRET,

WE BELIEVE THAT THE LEAST WE CAN DO

IS ALLOW CIZTO PREPARE FOR POSSIBLE RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC BY

ENGAGING IN A FRANK EXCHANGE ON CURRENT REVIEW BOARD PROCEEDINGS.

POSSIBLY UPSETTING TO (T797 SUCH A DISCUSSION WOULD BEST ALLOW

US TO DETERMINE ANY NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS

(PENSTON? AND COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES, POSSIBLY RESULTING FROM

EXPOSURE.

ALTHOUGH

TO RESPOND TO REF

A QUBST ONES

DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION

WE SUSPECT THAT THE (CUBAN-GOVERNMENT?

DOES NOT PROVIDE PENSIONSJTO EXPATRIATES. EVEN IF THIS WERE THE

HE STANDARD CUBAN PENSION IS CURRENTLY W

RIH LITTLE MORE THAN

SEVERAL DOLLARS PER MONTH.

THEREFORE, ANY SEVERING OF

PENSION WOULD NOT LIKELY HARM HIS FINANCIAL POSITION.

PER REF A QUERY REGARDING EFFECT OF (T./S EXPOSURE ON OTHER

OPBRATIONS, WE DO NOT TOOK FORWARD TO EXPLAINING TO ASSETS

CURRENTLY ON THE BOOKS WHY THE NAME OF A FORMER--AND. STILL

LIVING--TOROCKAWAY ASSET WAS OFFICIALLY DECLASSIFIED BY THE USG, WHEN

MERE DECLASSIFICATION OF INFORMATION ON ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY THAT

(ASSET ON TOROCKAWAY'IS: BEHALF WOULD PERHAPS HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT.

UNDERSTAND THAT HQS IS SEARCHING FOR ADDITIONAL 0/9-SPECIFIC

NFORMATION ON WHICH TO BASE AN ARGUMENT AGAINST DECLASSIFICATION_OE

SOS IDENTITY AND-WE-HOPELTO ASSIST IN THAT ENDEAVOR..^ HOWEVER, ON

BROADER SCALE, IF C/O-SIDENTITY AND ROLE WERE TO PROMINENTLY APPEAR

IN THEL

PRESS SUBSEQUENTLY TO DECLASSIFICATION, AT THE LEAST

WE WOULD EXPECT A MODERATE EROSION IN OUR ASSETS' CONFIDENCE THAI

TOROCKAWAY IS ABLE TO PROTECT THEIR IDENTITIES. (AS WE EXPECT OUR

ASSETS TO MAINTAIN THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE RELATIONSHIP FROM THEIR

OF THE EQUATION AND HAVE OFTEN MADE THIS A MATTER OF CONTENTIONC

WITH ASSETS, SOME AGENT HANDLING PROBLEMS COULD ENSUE WERE WE TO

APPEAR LESS THAN COMMITTED TO FULL PROTECTION OF THEIR IDENTITIES.

FUTURE AGENT ACQUISITIONS COULD ALSO BE COMPLICATED BY THE

DECLASSIFICATION OF I/9'S NAME, AS C/O'S WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO WORK

THAT MUCH HARDER TO CONVINCE

THAT WE CAN PROTECT THEIR

IDENTITY-FROM THE TYPICALLY ANTI-AMERTCAN-LOCAL PRESS.

REQUEST HOS COMMENT REGARDING NEED FOR RECONTACT OF ST/ 9) AND

REQUEST FILE REVIEW SO THAT WE WILL BE IN A FIRM POSITION FROM WHICH

TO ENGAGELT/9J.

ALTHOUGH (T/9) MAY NOT RECALL DETAILS OF ANY RECONTACT

FIAN AFTER THE CONSIDERABLE TIME ELAPSED SINCE WORKING AS AN AGENT,

PLEASE PROVIDE ANY DETAILS (I.E. CALIAS OF LAST HANDLING C/OD WHICH

_COULD SERVE AS BONA FIDES.

FINALLY, REQUEST HOS PROVIDE EXPLANATION

*OF EXACTLY HOW 1/9 IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE<JFK ASSASSINATION> AS (T/S IS

SURE TO PUT THIS QUESTION TO OUR OFFICER.
