AMENDED COMMENT

This document was released with portions deleted. The deleted portions

contain information confirming the existence of an Agency station in a specific

city abroad, information identifying an Agency staff employee and FBI special

agents, Agency internal filing instructions and information which if released

would tend to confirm the existence of an Agency intelligence operation (in

this instance one conducted jointly with a foreign liaison service). The deletions

were made under the authority of exemptions (b) (1), (b) (2), (b) (3) and

(b) (7) (F). The FBI special agent's name was deleted at the behest and request

of the FBI.
