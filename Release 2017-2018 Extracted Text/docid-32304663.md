"The file also shows that, although Mr. PINDILLI

never married, he lived with a woman out of wedlock from

1910 to 1927,

and as a result, six children were born to

them in this country.

His alleged wife was ordered de-

ported on July 16, 1930, also on

a narcotics charge.

application was denied on July 14, 1960.

he hinton d part the National, As we-las,

at this point by INs, exercising their semi-judiciary powers.

HILL advised that the complete file on PINDILLI is

maintained in Cleveland, Ohio, and would no longer be located

at St. Paul, Minnesota, where it had been located at one time.

It is felt by the Cleveland Division that PINDILLI,

who is now 77 years of age, would no longer be a threat to law

enforcement in the United States and especially since he is in

declining health and could be controlled by. CV 344-C.

It is also felt that if arrangements could be made

discreetly through Bureau liaison with the State Department

and/or INS at Washington, D. Co, for the re-entry of PINDILLI

into the United States on a visitor's visa, specific information

as to the present structure of the La Cosa Nostra can be obtained.

Additionally, it should be noted that Cv 344-C stated that his

father would

unquestionably be able to determine details con-

cerning such items as the CAVALLARO killing, the killing of the.

NAPLES brothers in Youngstown, and the VINCE DE NIRO killing

which are apparently all related. He noted that PINDILLI would

not divulge this information to anyone but he (CV 344-C) could

obtain and relay whatever, information PINDILLI obtained to this

Bureau.

It is also believed unlikely that PINDILLI would become

a problem while in the United States on a visitor's visa, but

should this occur his visa could be cancelled and he could then

be returned to Argentina.

If excellent intelligence information

is fortheoming due to his presence in the United States, it is

felt that the temporary visitor's visa could then be extended

to take full advantage of his position in the "organization."

It is requested that the Bureau through liaison with

the State Department,

the Department of Justice (Anti-Racketeering

Section) and/or INS at Washington, D. C., ascertain how a visa

may be obtained for PINDILLI.

Information furnished by CV 344-C reflected in Cleveland

airtel to the Bureau, dated January 17, 1964, is being paraphrased

and disseminated to other interested divisions.
