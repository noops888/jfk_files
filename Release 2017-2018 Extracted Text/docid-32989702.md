INFORMATION CONCERNING

FORMER FBI SPECIAL AGENT

INFORMATION CONCERNING

.

On 3-26-64, the Director received a copy of the Spring, 1964, issue

of "American Judaism,'

" the official publication of the Union of American Hebrew

Congregations. It was sent by Sylvan Lebow, who is listed'as an ex-officio member

of the publication's editorial board.

Excerpts of the Director's address on 12-4-63 before the Washington

Hebrew Congregation Brotherhood are reprinted on page 39, together with a picture

of Mir. Hoover receiving an artifact from Arnold Fine, the Brotherhood's President.

Page 46 contains a very fanciful article which is supposed to relate

some of the high points of the Bureau career of former Special Agent Harvey Burstein.-

Written in a very braggadocio manner, this item contends that Burstein made himself

invaluable to the FBI because he had the distinction of being the first Yiddish and

Hebrew speaking Special Agent. The article does make the point that Burstein was

not the first member of the Jewish faith employed bypthe FBI. 6 2 - 53484 3/ R64

The article is replete with claris that cannot be substantiated by a review

of Burstein's personnel file, and with outright errors. He is identified as a wartime

Agent who, in 1941, was assigned to "all aspects of internal security, the tasks of

espionage and foreign intelligence. The war was raging in Europe, and tensions were

mounting between Japan and the United States." Burstein actually entered the FBI on

8-25-41, as a clerk, and was assigned as a student fingerprint classifier. He resigned

his position on 6-22-42 to enter military service. He was reinstated on 7-26-48 as a

clerk, and did not receive an appointment as Special Agent until 10-25-48. He resigned

from the Bureau again an 8-14-53, having served in Chicago and Washingto Peter

His ille does indicate that a request was made on 11-3-41 that Burstein be

made available to the Translation Unit for the purpose of translating Yiddish newspapers.

Re: SYLVAN LEBOW

HARVEY BURSTEIN

The article, however, relates an incident that supposedly took place in 1941 with the

discovery by a citizen in New York City of a metal container supposedly containing a coded

message.

A courier was rushed to Washington with the "coded message," according

to the article, and orders were issued to "Get 'Agent' Burstein on the double," The

article goes on to state that Burstein entered a room where Agents were crowded around a

desk on which the container rested. Burstein took one look and supposedly said:

"Gentlemen, this is the Sh'ma, the basic credo of the Jewish faith--nothing to worry about"".

' The container was a mezuzah.

The article then states that down the long corridors of the FBI went the word

that if "anything comes across any desk in a foreign language, call Burstein."

INFORMATION IN BUFILES:

Bufiles contain no derogatory information identifiable with Sylvan Lebow.

Harvey Burstein's services were satisfactory, however, in a memorandum dated

11-14-48, former Assistant Director Tamm set forth a summary of Burstein's FBI record.

Mr. Tamm knew Burstein and said he felt he was an opportunist who had an exaggerated

opinion of his own ability; that he did not feel he could be trusted nor that he would do any

thing for the FBI except to use it to further his own interests; and that he felt we should

deal with Burstein circumspectly. The Director noted, "I think this is a proper

evaluation."

OBSERVATIONS:

We have been very circumspect in our relationship with Burstein and it is

felt nothing would be gained by calling his hand on this rather absurd article. It bears

out the evauation made of the man in 1958. It is believed Mr. Lebow sent the magazine to

the Director because of the speech excerpts and the picture, and not in connection with the

article on Burstein.

RECOMMENDATION:

BACKGROUND:

Rabb Benjamin Shhulta, Erecutive Director, American

Jewish League Against Communism,

Inco, 220 lest send Stree:

New

York City, aduised agants of our

New York Office on August 29,

1955, that he

wanted to bring to the attention of the IBI o

"movement" taking place today among the Jews of not informing on

other people before Congressional committees.

He stated that

recently the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, 838 Fifüh

Avenues

wow core clay, consisting of reformed synagogues,

passed a resolution declaring that it is the duty of a Jew not

to testify before any Congressional committee investigating

Communism.

In this connection, Rabbi Schultz made available

a transcript' of the Barry Gray radio progrom of August 21, 1955, on

station hea, New York citys in onder to reveal the thinking

of a representative of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations

on the question of cooperating with a Congressional committee.

A review of this radio transcript discloses that

program was an informal discussion led by Barry Gray,

r0040

commentator, who maintained that a percon should not avail

himseif of the construtional Amendments when called before

congressional committee, along with a Dr. Theodore Gill, described

Protestant olerguman, Ralph smith, a lucker and a writer for

the "Atlantic Monthly" and other publicationg, and Rabbi Eugene J.

Lipman, Director of the committee on Social Action of the Union

of American Hebrew Congregations. The question under discussion

was the first Constitutional Amendment, particularly the clause

which pertains io religion which a senate subcommittee will study

in october, 1955, to see if we are receiving all of our rights

guaranteed

by the first Amendment. Barry Gray and Smith upheld

the position that a duly constituted Congressional committee,

though its purpose may be immoral, has the right, so long as

does so under the law, to require a citizen to appear and

testify. Rabbi Lipman and Dr. Gill upheld the opposite view.

Although, as stated above, Lipman was identified as

Director of the Committee on Social

Action of the Union of

American lebrew congregations, he did not state at any time

That the opinions espressed by him on the radio program were

the opinions of this

group. Lipmon stated on the program that

he would not

cooperate completely with Congressional investiguring

committees because these committees are operating in a "content.

He said,

"Its a contert of five to eight years of abuse of duly-

constrtuted dongressional investigative authority." Lipman

stated further,

"IT. Shalth (Ralph smith, referred to above)

takes one position.

He says that a duly constituted contressional

committee, though its purpose may be immoral, has the right, in

long as it does so under law, to exact what you personally may

George Sokolsky advised me that as a result of his

recent column on the resolution of the Union of American Hebrew

(Congregations he has had a phenomenal mail and that it is uniformly

in opposition to the resolution adopted by the Congregation at their

"Los Angeles meeting.

George further told me that emissaries of the

Congregation had approached Rabbi Benjamin Shultz, stated they

would like to talk to George about his column and would Shultz

arrange it. George told Shultz not to arrange it, merely to say

Sokolsky was easily approached and they should contact him directly.

They then stated George had the wrong idea on the resolution, that

it was misunderstood; that it was really anti-Communist and had one

sentence in it to that effect.

The real background of the resolution, according to

George, is found

I in the fact that a study has been made of the names

of individuals convicted and exposed in connection with Communist

activities; that 82 'per cent of the names are of Jewish origin and

the Jewish organizations consider this as a reflection upon Jews as

a race and feel they must protect the race. George staied this, of

course, is asinine and the race will be extinguished by such activities.

He stated he has been surprised at the number of serious-minded Jews

who now agree to this, yet he is getting very disgusted at the timidity

of others.

He then mentioned that Gordon Greenfield of the

had gone on the American Jewish League Against Communism of

which Sokoisky is President; that he Greenfield, submitted his

resignation. Greenfield told Roy Cohn no one would ever know

what pressure he had been under. Sokolsky got mad and sent a wire

to Greenfield stating he, Sokolsky, was sic! and tired of fighting for

people who were gradually committing suicide because they have not

got the guts to stand up.

This concerned Greenfield very much and

Greenfield again contacted Roy Cohn and stated he wanted to come

and see George and explain the situation to him.

George needs

$40,000 to run the organization for a year and he is going to tell

Greenfield the only explanation he can give now is a personal con-

tribution of $40,000.

which Sokolsky is President; that he Greenfield, submitted his

resignation. Greenfield told Roy Cohn no one would ever know

what pressure he had been under. Sokolsky got mad and sent a wire

to Greenfield stating he, Sokolsky, was sick and tired of fighting for

people who were gradually committing suicide because they have not

got the guts to stand up.

This concerned Greenfield very much and

Greenfield again contacted Roy Cohn and stated he wanted to come

and see George and explain the situation to him.

George needs

$40,000 to run the organization for a year and he is going to tell

Greenfield the only explanation he can give now is a personal con-

tribution of $40, 000.

column in the Washington Post for 3/1/55.

On this subject, Sokolsky is going to assign this situation as a

Project to the American Jewish League Against Communism of which be is

STATEMENT ON

JUDAISM and INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM

Judais teaches that liberty stems inalienably from God, and that the

soul is the divine element in man which cannot be interfered with by other men or

governments of men. Deep respect for the right of conscience inheres in Jewish

reverence for the human personality. The right to express or keep private the

dictates of his conscience, and to give utterance to honest dillerences among men,

is part of the Jewish tradition:

""These and those are the words of the Living

In the conviction that these principles of Juiaisn are equally relevant to

the contemporary scene, and because we believe that the preservation of democracy

in the United States rests in large part upon preservation of the American prin-

ciples of civil liberties and civil rights, the Union of American Hebrew Congre-

gations, at this Biennial assembly, hereby declares these basic principles:

The most significant trena in the area of civil liberties is the steady

encroachnent upon our freedoms by certain elements in Governnent. The legitinate

and necessary requirements of protecting ourselves fron communist infiltrution and

espionage have been grossly exploited by some to justify certain governmental pro-

cedures which corrode

freedom of speech and of conscience under the claim that

these must field to the larger security of the nation. The need for a calm, steady,

and positive program to insure the triuph of democracy over communism has given

to a pathological fear of communism which inhibits the thinking of some politi-

cal leaders and colors the juagment of many citizens. We oppose any effort,

legislative or otherwise, which would make criminal the expression of opinion, no

matter how controversial. We must not hark back to the days of the Alien and

Sedition Laws which the people repudiated 150 years ago. The anomaly of the concept

that the State can preserve its security while it weakens individual freedom seems

to have been lost upon us. Seven centuries of travail, blood, and sacrifice, from

Magna Carta to the Atlantic Charter, hang in the balance.

We have tended to proscribe every person and organization at any time

pro-Soviet, including many of the most effective present opponents of conmunism,

and regardless of whether former attitudes now condemned were at the time consist

ent with our national policy. Those loyalty-security procedures which deny confron-

tation and thus encourage false witness; the type of congressional investigation

which in contravention of constitutional liberties tries individuals for their be

liefs; the public condemnation by the Attorney General of organizations without

previous hearing; these must not become accepted techniques of government.

We deny the validity of the proposition that our government can make

• itself more secure by denying justice to any man. Absolute security for the State

1s possible of achievement only in a totalitarian regime and is unattainable in a

democracy. There can be no freedom without some measure of risk. In the current

demand for absolute security, we must not utilize the totaliterian practices of the

enemies of denocracy, thus destroying the human end spiritual values which are the

mark of civilized men.

Congressional investigators are calling upon schools, colleges and other institutions

to deny the right to work to those who would seek refuge in the charter of our liber-

• persons claimed to be politically undesirable.

The unfortunate result is that the

canipus and cless roons in a number of our institutions are ceasing to be places where

the youth of imerica nay leorn the spiritual values of dissent and nonconformity.

HH 55310 DocId:32989702 Page 37

## Page 38

Within the framework of the National Conmunity Relations Advisory

Council we have taken our position with respect to the usurpation of power by

Congressional investigating committees, and have made suggestions for curbing

their excesses.

We protest the irresponsible use of political informers by our law

enforcement agencies. We deplore the view that citizens should be encouraged to

inform agairst fellow citizens with respect to their opinions and political

associations.

We would defend all constitutional privileges and immunities without

regard to the guilt or innocence of those who invoke then. In our view, the

preservation of these rights is of greater significance to our way of life than

any benefit our law enforcement agencies can derive fron curtailment or suspen-

sion of these rights.

We abhor the test oath and its loyalty oath derivations.

As did our

forefathers before us, we reject the notion that the techniques of the Inquisition,

the High Comnission and the Star Chamber are to have acceptance by us in any form.

We favor the vitalization of the Civil Rights Section in the Department

of Justice by whatever legislative and administrative procedures are necessary.

We believe that the preservation of civil rights and civil. liberties is a function

of government equal in importance to the prosecution of subversive offenses.

There are heartening signs of increased awareness of the need to reverse

current assaults on fundamental liberties.

Yet the fever of suspicion and fear,

which has impaired our country's prestige throughout the worla, has not yet abated.

We know that the price of civil liberties is eternal vigilance. Liberty cannot

be stored away, even for a day.

Therefore:

I. We re-alfirm the recommendation, adopted aù our°

42nd Biennial Assembly, that the President of the

United States be requested to appoint a Commission

of outstanding citizens representative of the

broadest possible cross-section of American life

to study the best ways of protecting our nation

from totalitarian dangers without subverting our

traditional American freedoms.

2. We urge the Rabbis and leaders of our congregations

to join forthrightly in the struggle to saleguara

civil liberties and to speak out with dignity and

with courage for their preservation. The Jewish

ethic supports, indeed is the spiritual source o1,

these liberties.

As teachers and adherents of

Judaism, we are, by our religious faith, conmitted

to defend them for the benefit of all men.

55310

DooId:32989702 Page 38

## Page 39

3. We urge the appointment of congregational Social

Action Committees to study the application of

ethical principles to the problems of civil liber-

ties,

and to consider ways of resisting all efforts

to enjoin upon us conformity of thought or speech.

4o We urge our national Commission on Social Action to

seek the cooperation of all groups which share our

concern for the maintenance of American liberties.

Our political and religious faiths are both bound up

with the preservation of our liberties; as Americans

and as Jews we must cooperate with those who would

defend them.

it will be noted

subsequently, is one of the participating organizations in the AMERICAN JINISH

CONFERENCE.

Similarly, the AMERICAN JEWISH CONGRESS I3 the American

affiliate of the international group known as the WORLD JEWISH CONGRESS,

From a publication entitled "Rules of Election for the American Jewish

Conference", available in the New York City Public Library, it has been as-

certained that formal meetings leading toward the formation of the AMERICAN

JEWISH CONFERENCE began with a convention of rapresentatives of so-called

national jewish membership organizations which was held in Pittsburgh,

Pennsylvania on January 23-24, 1943. At this meeting it was resolved to take

the initiative in the forning of an American Jewish Assembly, organized on

democratic lines, which would have as its purpose the establishment of a

•conmon program of action on post-war Jewish problems, An additional purpose

of this meeting was to elect a delegation to further the aforementioned

program in cooperation with the duly accredited representatives of Jews

throughout the world. As a result of this, an Executive Committee was named

and authorized to act as follows:

I) To organize an Assembly to consist of not more than 500 delegates

of. whom 125 shall be named by the cooperating national organizations and 375

shall be elected by the Jewish Conmunities through communal or regional

conferences called and organized for that purpose.

2) To allocate the delegates to communities or regions on the basis

of the distribution of the Jewish population.

3) To provide for the election of delegates by national membershig

organizations in accordance with their own rules.

4) To provide that representation in the communal or regional

conferences shall be based on the number of members of the local groups.

5) To provide for the observance of the principle of proportionate

representation in the communal or regional conferences that are held for the

election of delegates to the assembly.

The aforesaid publication reveals that the Executive Comnittee of the

Assembly net on April 5, 1943 and formulated and approved rules to govern the

election of delegates.

It further reflects that the Executive Committse in a

meeting on April 1?, 1943 adopted a resolution changing the name of the AMERICAN

JEWISH ASSEMBLY to the AMERICAN JEVISH CONFERENCE. These rules restated that

the total number of delegates would be 500, 125 to be elected by national

Jewish membership organizations and 375 to be elacted by the jewish Communities

of the United States. It further provided that each delegate was

to pay a

Registration Fee of $50.

The bally Monkey for lay 1, 1943 announced that the date for con-

vening the AMERICAN JEWISH CONFERENCE, which it described as promising to be

one of the leading historic events in the development of National Unity, had

baen tentatively set for July 1 to 5, 1943. It stated that 43 national Jewish

organizations were supporters of the gathering. Subsequent issues of the

"Daily Worker" reflect that the first formal Conference meeting began on

August 29, 1943 in New York City and lasted five days.

Preliminary to the convening of the Conference, the Executive Conmittee

previously mentioned, prepared a lengthy "Survey of Facts and Opinions on

Problems of Post-war Jewry in Europe and Palestine," This Survey, which was

prepared in the form of a pamphlet and which is available in the New York

Public Library, was written by a Committee on Preliminary Studies under

authorization of the Executive Committee. A revier of this publication

A AFTERMATH OF THE AMERICAN JEWISH CONFERENCE

As the war approaches a conclusion, the problem of

Palestine's future moves steadily to the fore. In mat-

ters affecting Palestine a powerful pressure poten-

tial is the American Jewish community. of nearly

5,000,000, the largest in the world. Vigorous demands

for creation of a Jewish Commonwealt'i in Palestine,

which were adopted by an overwhelming vote at the

recent American Jewish Conference, have now con-

strained the minority of non-and anti-Zionists into

the most open opposition. With official Zionist policy

becoming more militant, repercussions are being felt

in Jewish circles everywhere. These developments,

together with the approaching fulfillment of the

terms of the British White Paper of 1939 and the

publicity-seeking activities of extremist groups, have

brought the issue of Palestine closer home tha: ever

before to American Jewry.

THE harmony and unity of purpose which was hoped for in the

American Jewish community following the meeting of the American

Jewish Conference in New York, 29 August-2 September 1943 (as de-

scribed in FN Number 149, 13 September 1943), has failed of realiza-

tion. Recent weeks have brought again to the American Jewish com-

munity bitter factional disputes. The Zionist leadership which spon-

sored at the Conference last September a resolution, voted almost

unanimously, to call for the establishment of a Jewish national state

in Palestine, still represents the substantial majority of American

Jewish opinion, but the minority opposition has moved to attack. The

militantly anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism peppers away

at the Zionist program, so far with limited results. Of more signifi-

cance is the withdrawal of the non-Zionist/American Jewish Commit-

tee from further participation in the Conference.

It is charged now by the opposition that the American Jewish Conference

was not a representative body, that it was packed from start to finish by the

Zionists, and that the local elections were so controlled that delegates came to

the meeting with voting directives from Zionist bodies. According to these

circles the Conference excluded many national and local agencies, whereas

Zionist organizations with overlapping memberships were admitted. Large wel-

fare agencies of the type of the Joint Distribution Committee and the various

Jewish philanthropic federations, many of whose leaders and members are

non- or anti-Zionist, were not represented. Since a considerable segment of the

American Jewish community participates in Jewish affairs only through these

charitable organizations, many American Jews can be said to have been denied

a voice at the Conference.

The American Jewish

Through its president, Judge Joseph M Proskauer,

Committee Withdraws

the American Jewish Committee promptly regis-

tered disagreement with the Palestine Resolution, but it had been hoped that

this leading non-Zionist group would continue to participate in the Conference

for the sake of Jewish unity on other issues. This hope was short-lived. Follow-

ing a meeting of its executive committee on 24 October, the American Jewish

Committee announced withdrawal from further association with the Confer-

ence. It based its action on the Conference's demand for the establishment of a

Jewish Commonwealth in Palestine and on subordination by the Conference of

other Jewish issues to "the problem of the political structure of Palestine."

This decision of the executive elicited immediate reaction within the

American Jewish Committee. Three prominent Monists resigned Irom the ex-

ecutive committee: they were Mrs. David›de Sola Pool, president of Hadassah,

women's Zionist organization; and Judge Louis F. Levinthal and Magistrate

Morris Rothenberg, both former presidents of the Zionist Organization of

America. During subsequent weeks a number of organizations Hadassah

Independent Order Brith Abraham Free Sons of Israel United Synagogue of

America, therabbinical Assemoly of America - gave up their membership

in the Committee. Criticism from Zionist groups and the Jewish press was

widespread. The American Zionist Emergency Council, political executive for

American Zionist groups, denounced the withdrawal of the American Jewish

Committee as "a calculated attack on Jewish unity" and a disruptive factor,

but it cautioned against exaggerating the importance of the secession in the

light of what it termed the relative insignificance of the Committee in Ameri-

can life.

These events have brought the American Jewish Committee to internal

reorganization. From a loose federation of participating Jewish bodies of all

types, it plans to make itself now into a direct membership organization, and it

will soon launch a campaign for supporters of its position.

Spokesmen for the American Jewish Committee characterize it not so

much anti-Zionist as anti-nationalist. The Committee endorses the idea of

Palestine as a refuge for Jews, but does not support the program for a Jewish

national state. In line with this policy, the Committee disapproves of the Bri-

tish White Paper of 1939 and seeks its abrogation. Above all, however, it em-

phasizes that there should be no political identification of American Jews with

the governing of Palestine. On these grounds it criticizes the direction of cur-

rent Zionist leadership which culminated in the Palestine Resolution at the

American Jewish Conference. •

Describing the position of the American Jewish Committee as that of a

"hopeless minority," one of its leaders has emphasized the difficulties which

face the non-Zionists in trying to combat what he described as a well-organized

propaganda machine. The Committee plans to educate and enlighten Ameri-

can Jews on "the real issues" involved in the future of Palestine. Its leaders

are convinced that the great mass of the community is completely ignorant

of the facts, and is being mislead. Even the Zionists, they insist, do not believe

that the establishment of a Jewish Commonwealth in Palestine is possible and

are consequently raising a false hope. The Committee leaders expect that, if

this view can be made to prevail, Zionist leaders will appear so discredited in

the eyes of American Jewry that the leadership offered by the American Jewish

Committee will be acknowleged as the wisest.

Other Dissenters

Although many Jewish organizations at meetings and

conventions held since the Conference closed have en-

dorsed all the decisions reached at that assembly, there have been a few dis-

senting voices besides that of the American Jewish Committee. The executive

board of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, a Reform lay group,

unanimously approved all resolutions adopted by the American Jewish Confer-

ence except the Palestine Resolution; on this it postponed decision. The Nation-

al Council of Jewish Women, an affliate of the American Jewish Committee,

endorsed the action of its delegates who had refrained from voting on the Com-

monwealth issue, but remained within the Conference.

Jewish Labor

An index worthy of attention is to be found in the Jewish

Committee

Labor Committee, a Socialist group whose organ, the Forward

of New York, was the only Yiddish paper which did not bitterly dencunce the

recent anti-Zionist action of the American Jewish Committee. Delegates of the

Jewish Labor Committee refrained from voting on the Palestine Resolution at

the September Conference. The Committee's leaders are traditionally anti-

Zionist, but the organization has shifted to a non-Zionist stand because the

Jewish Socialists have found it expedient to ally themselves with the Labor

Zionists (Poale-Zion) on many labor issues and on matters of domestic eco-

nomic policy. The Socialists have also been waging a bitter struggle with the

Communists in New York City over control of the American Labor Party, and

here they find it inexpedient to alienate the large group of Labor Zionists which

has always constituted a major element in the right-wing coalition to which

the Socialists belong. Should the Jewish Labor Committee nevertheless reaf-

firm its traditional opposition to Zionism and resign from the Conference (a

development which some observers believe possible) this would bring the most

serious blow which the Zionists have had to face to date.

of genuine Orthodox Judaism. The Agudas Israel has contemplated putting

under international supervision.

many Reform rabbis it is precisely from this branch of American Judaism that

logical seminary, uttered a bitter polemic against the present trends of Zionism.

Reviewing the birth and development of Zionism, Dr. Morgenstern recounted:

It has run the entire gamut of modern racial nationalism from the, as

we now see, very medest hope of restoration of Palestine as the center of a

new, positive and intensive Jewish cultural life, to the extreme theory of

Jewish nationalism, practically identical with Nazist and Fascist theory, which

holds that the bonds of Jewish racial nationalism are eternally indissoluble;

that there can ever be only one Jewish homeland, only one land in which the

Jew can ever feel himself completely at home; that eternally he is a member

of the Jewish racial nation, however that term may be defined; that he resides

among the nations, as at present, only as a temporary sojourner. ...

Despite the oft-repeated, high-sounding asseverations of the beneficent

role which a Jewish state or commonwealth in Palestine may play or will play

in setting a happy pattern of equitable social relations for all other nations

to emulate, the most recent formulation of which is in the bombastic perora-

tion of the so-called Palestine resolution of the American Jewish Conference,

the fact, incontestably established by history, still confronts us with the

brazen truth, that the true genius and destiny of Isreal finds expression only

in its role as a religious people....

Evidence is already at hand to indicate that the Zionist issue may cause

further dissension in the Jewish religious community. Two Reform congrega-

tions, one in Houston and the other in Tulsa, which are dominated by rabbis

and laymen sympathetic to anti-Zionism, have amended their by-laws so as

to exclude from congregational offices all members who admit to being Zion-

ists. On the other hand, in Philadelphia many members of one congregation

walked out from a rabbi's Yom Kippur sermon when he attacked the Ameri-

can Jewish Conference.

American Council

The views of Dr. Morgenstern on Palestine and Zionism

for Judaism

are almost identical with the ideals expressed in the

program put forth by the American Council for Judaism. This is a group estab-

lished late in 1942, which exploded a bomb-shell by issuing an uncompromis-

• ingly anti-Zionist statement while the American Jewish Conference was in

session. Deep resentment was aroused among the delegates and the action

contributed unquestionably to the virtually unanimous passage of the Pales-

tine Resolution. There has been criticism therefore of its timing. The Council

insists, however, that its initiative at the moment chosen was well justified by

the amount of publicity which resulted, serving to call the attention of the

American public to the fact that not all American Jews were Zionist.

of the well-known merchandising family, and Rabbi Elmer. Berger of Flint,

Michigan, has now inaugurated a vigorous campaign for membership and

commenced publication of a semi-monthly bulletin. It is sponsoring an ad-

vertising campaign in the hostile Yiddish and Anglo-Jewish press. Its program

rests upon a conviction that the basis of unity among Jews must be religion

and that Jews should consider themselves nationals of those countries in which

they live and those lands their homelands. It advocates a program of rehabili-

tation and re-settlement for uprooted Jewry, in which Palestine should. con-

tinue to play a part; but it insists that any hopeful future for the Jews in Pales-

tine depends upon the ultimate establishment of a democratic government

there, in which Jews, Moslems, and Christians should be justly represented.

The Council opposes efforts to establish a Jewish State in Palestine or elsewhere

and believes that all philosophies stressing Jewish racialism, nationalism, and

homelessness are injurious to the Jewish interest.

Whether this militant anti-Zionist group will meet with any broad success

remains to be seen. The Council has established a branch in San Francisco

and claims to have enrolled some 1,200 members throughout the United States

during the initial months of its campaign. Although numerically small, it is

financially strong since its supporters are to be found chiefly in the upper eco-

nomic stratum of assimilated Jewish society. It would welcome some sort of

merger with the American Jewish Committee, with which it shares many com-

mon interests and some interlocking leadership, but such a union does not

at the moment seem very probable. The Committee is inclined to question

whether the Council does not unwisely overstate the anti-Zionist position. It ap-

prehends that a union might only bring to the Committee the additional ill will

in the Jewish community which the Council seems to have engendered by its

belligerency.

they have resented the exclusion of their organizations from the Conference

last September. It is very unlikely that these agencies have any desire openly tọ

align themselves with the opponents of political Zionism, but there exists some

possibility that they may be forced to do so. At a recent meeting in New York,

Dr. Joseph Tenenbaum, chairman of thel United Jewish War Effort, advocated

the Conference. Any attempt to enforce such supervision would undoubtedly

meet with much opposition and become probably a boomerang against the

and the widening rift between the Zionists and their oppo-

nents has been a turn toward extremism in Zionist affairs. While there has

always been disagreement between the rival factions, based on fundamentally

divergent points of view, there have been occasions when Zionists, non-Zionists,

and even anti-Zionists have been able to cooperate on common Jewish issues.

This fact inspired the American Jewish Conference.

Zionists and non-Zionists alike are opposed to the British White Paper and

actively seek its abrogation. The Amrican Jewish Committee, in the state-

ment issued upon its withdrawal from the Conference, emphasized its deter-

mined opposition to the White Paper, which (it will be remembered) closes the

doors of Palestine to Jewish immigration after 31 March 1944. The American

Council for Judaism has not yet publicly announced its position on the White

Paper. However, one of its members has privately expressed a personal opinion

which may well reflect the Council's probable stand. He objected to the White

Paper on the ground that anything which restricts Jewish rights anywhere

is anti-democratic, but not because it specifically restricts the immigration of

Jews into Palestine.

As the date for the termination of Jewish immigration into Palestine rap-

idly approaches, opposition to the White Paper has increased. Thel American

Zionist Emergency Council, under the direction of Dr. Abba Hillel Silver, has

begun a vigorous campaign, appealing for intervention by the United States

Government to obtain suspension of the terms of this controversial document.

Similarly, the Zionist Organization of America sponsored a mass protest demon-

stration in Carnegie Hall on 1 November, the twenty-sixth anniversary of the

Balfour Declaration, at which messages of support were received from Wendell

Willkie and Governor Thomas E. Dewey, and a resolution adopted appealing for

President Roosevelt's intercession. The recent announcement of the British

Colonial Office that those Jews entitled to enter Palestine under the terms of

the White Paper, but prevented by circumstances of war from so doing, will

be admitted after March 1944, is hardly regarded as a concession.

Moderate Zion-

The unity of purpose between the Zionists and their

ists Lose Out

opponents on abrogation of the White Paper does not

lead to agreement over the means to be used to further this aim. Disagreement

has been increased as a result of a shift of control in Zionist leadership away

from the hands oi the moderates into those of men more extreme who have

made the political independence of Palestine the paramount issue of zionism.

At the American Jewish Conference the veteran Zionist leaders Rabbi Stephen

sWise, Robert Szold, and Mrs. David de Sola Pool-were forced into secondary

roles and the reins of control were seized by Rabbi Abba Hillel Silver, Nahum

Goldmann, and Louis Lipsky, who won the Conference over completely to a

more extreme Zionist position.

This development is not confined to the American Zionist scene alone. The

attempted resignation recently of David Ben-Gurion as chairman of the

executive of the Jewish Agency for Palestine was part of the same trend. Ben-

Gurion has been demanding more direct action and a militant program; in-

cluding the creation of a Jewish Army, non-cooperation with the Palestine

Government, and active resistance to Britain's policy of curtailing immigration.

This latest resignation, Ben-Gurion's third since the beginning of the war and,

like the others, rejected, appears to be a direct challenge to the more moderate

leadership of Dr. Chaim' Weizmann for the control of Zionist policies.

• The Revisionists

Ben-Gurion's current position has led to frequent rumors

that he may join forces with the most extreme wing of the Zionist movement

represented by the New Zionist Organization, commonly known as the Revision-

ists. This group, founded by the late Vladimir Jabotinsky, has steadfastly de-

manded the establishment of a Jewish State in Palestine, to which it insists

the Transjordan should be joined. The Revisionists have remained outside of

the World Zionist Organization, have refused all cooperation with other

Zionist groups. Their American adherents would not participate in the recent

American Jewish Conference.

Numerically weak, with no more than several hundred supporters in the

- United States the New Zionist Organization has during the past few years

been vociferous out of all proportion to its actual strength. Its activities in this

country are being directed by a delegation of Palestinians, headed by Peter

"Bergson and including Eri Jabotinsky, son of Vladimir, and Alexandelt Hadani

By setting up a number ot committees and frequently placing in the American

press full page advertisements, the Revisionists have kept their activities in

the public eye and before American legislators from whom they have won en-

dorsements. The Committee for a Jewish Army oi Stateless and Palestinian

Jews, the, Emergency_ Committee to save the Jewish People of Burope, the

American Resettlerent Committee for Uprooted Jewry, and a newest venture,

the American Legion for a Free Palestine which seeks as members 1,000,000 Jews

and non-Jews-all of these groups through interlocking leadership are Revi-

sionist-sponsored and are connected with the New Zionist Organization. Funds

for their vigorous propaganda campaign have come from a few rich backers,

including, it is believed, a number of anti-British Gentiles. Their advertise-

ments, which invariably carry a fund-soliciting coupon, are thought to be

self-sustaining.

While the general trend of Zionist political policy as manifested at the

American Jewish Conference has now become almost indistinguishable from

the demands of the Revisionists, the latter maintain independence of action.

Zionist circles in the United States have mildly criticized the publicity tactics

of the Revisionists, but they have done little to attempt to control them. It is

believed, however, that the most recent activities of this group may cause a

change in the official Zionist policy toward it. A pilgrimage, sponsored by the

Revisionists, of some 500 Orthodox rabbis to Washington on 7 October to

petition the President and Congress to rescue the Jews of Europe was viewed

with misgiving in many Zionist circles. The recent action of the Emergency

Committee to Save the Jews of Europe in sponsoring a Joint Resolution in

Congress which calls for the creation of a special commission to plan the rescue

of the Jews of Europe has finally brought the matter to a head. The American

Jewish Conference is now considering some action to indicate to the public that

these Revisionist-controlled committees represent only a small group of people

and are not authorized to speak for American Jewry.

A AFTERMATH OF THE AMERICAN JEWISH CONFERENCE

As the war approaches a conclusion, the problem of

Palestine's future moves steadily to the fore. In mat-

ters affecting Palestine a powerful pressure poten-

tial is the American Jewish community. of nearly

5,000,000, the largest in the world. Vigorous demands

for creation of a Jewish Commonwealth in Palestine,

which were adopted by an overwhelming vote at the

recent American Jewish Conference, have now con-

strained the minority of non-and unti-Zionists into

the most open opposition. With official Zionist policy

becoming more militant, repercussions are being felt

in Jewish circles everywhere. These developments,.

together with the approaching fulfillment of the

terms of the British White Paper of 1939 and the

publicity-seeking activities of extremist groups, have

brought the issue of Palestine closer home tha? ever

before to American Jewry.

THE harmony and unity of purpose which was hoped for in, the

American Jewish community following the meeting of the American

Jewish Conference in New York, 29 August-2 September 1943 (as de-

scribed in FN Number 149, 13 September 1943), has failed of realiza-

tion. Recent weeks have brought again to the American Jewish com-

munity bitter factional disputes. The Zionist leadership which spor-

sored at the Conference last September a resolution, voted almost

unanimously, to call for the establishment of a Jewish national state

in Palestine, still represents the substantial majority of American

Jewish opinion, but the minority opposition has moved to attack. The

militantly anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism peppers away

at the Zionist program, so far with limited results. Of more signifi-

cance is the withdrawal of the non-Zionist American Jewish Commit-

tee from further participation in the Conference.

It is charged now by the opposition that the American Jewish Conference

was not a representative body, that it was packed from start to finish by the

Zionists, and that the local elections were so controlled that delegates came to

the meeting with voting directives from Zionist bodies. According to these

circles the Conference excluded many national and local agencies, whereas

Zionist organizations with overlapping memberships were admitted. Large wel-

fare agencies of the type of the Joint Distribution Committee and the various

Jewish philanthropic federations, many of whose leaders and members are

non- or anti-Zionist, were not represented. Since a considerable segment of the

American Jewish community participates in Jewish affairs only through these

charitable organizations, many American Jews can be said to have been denied

& voice at the Conference.

The American Jewish

Through its president, Judge Joseph M. Proskauer,

Committee Withdraws

the American Jewish Committee promptly regis-

tered disagreement with the Palestine Resolution, but it had been howed that

this leading non-Zionist group would continue to participate in the Conference

for the sake of Jewish unity on other issues. This hope was short-lived. Follow-

ing a meeting of its executive committee on 24 October, the American Jewish

Committee announced withdrawal from further association with the Confer-

ence. It based its action on the Conference's demand for the establishment of a

Jewish Commonwealth in Palestine and on subordination by the Conference of

other Jewish issues to "the problem of the political structure of Palestine."

This decision of the executive elicited immediate reaction within the

American Jewish Committee. Three prominent Zionists resigned from the ex-

ecutive committee: they were Mrs. Davidíde Sola Pool, president of Hadassah,

women's Zionist organization; and Judge Louis E. Levinthal and Magistrate

Morris Rothenberg, both former presidents of the Zionist Organization of

America. During subsequent weeks a number of organizations -Hadassah,

Independent Order Brith Abraham Free Sons of Israel, United Synagogue of

America, the Rabbinical Assembly of America - gave up their membership

in the Committee. Criticism from Zionist groups and the Jewish press was

widespread. The American Zionist Emergency Council, political executive for

American Zionist groups, denounced the withdrawal of the American, Jewish

Committee as "a calculated attack on Jewish unity" and a disruptive factor,

but it cautioned against exaggerating the importance of the secession in the

light of what it termed the relative insignificance of the Committee in Ameri-

can life.

These events have brought the American Jewish Committee to internal

reorganization. From a loose federation of participating Jewish bodies of ali

types, it plans to make itself now into a direct membership organization, and it

will soon launch a campaign for supporters of its position.

Spokesmen for the American Jewish Committee characterize it not so

• much anti-Zionist as anti-nationalist. The Committee endorses the idea of

Palestine as a refuge for Jews, but does not support the program for a Jewishi

national state. In line with this policy, the Committee disapproves of the Bri-

tish White Paper of 1939 and seeks its abrogation. Above all, however, it em-

phasizes that there should be no political identification of American Jews with

the governing of Palestine. On these grounds it criticizes the direction of cur-

rent Zionist leadership which culminated in the Palestine Resolution at the

American Jewish Conference.

Describing the position of the American Jewish Committee as that of a

"hopeless minority," one of its leaders has emphasized the dificulties which

face the non-Zionists in trying to combat what he described as a well-organized

propaganda machine. The Committee plans to educate and enlighten Ameri-

can Jews on "the real issues" involved in the future of Palestine. Its leaders

are convinced that the great mass of the community is completely ignorant

of the facts, and is being mislead. Even the Zionists, they insist, do not believe

that the establishment of a Jewish Commonwealth in Palestine is possible and

are consequently raising a false hope. The Committee leaders expect that, if

this view can be made to prevail, Zionist leaders will appear so discredited in

the eyes of American Jewry that the leadership offered by the American Jewish

Committee will be acknowleged as the wisest.

Other Dissenters

Although many Jewish organizations at meetings and

conventions held since the Conference closed have en-

dorsed all the decisions reached at that assembly, there have been a few dis-

senting voices besides that of the American Jewish Committee. The executive

board of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, a Reform lay group,

unanimously approved all resolutions adopted by the American Jewish Confer-

ence except the Palestine Resolution; on this it postponed decision. The Nation-

al Council of Jewish Women, an amliate of the American Jewish Committee,

endorsed the action of its delegates who had refrained from voting on the Com-

monwealth issue, but remained within the Conference.

Jewish Labor An index worthy of attention is to be found in the Jewish

Labor Committee, a Socialist group whose organ, the Forward

of New York, was the only Yiddish paper which did not bitterly denounce the

recent anti-Zionist action of the American Jewish Committee. Delegates of the

Jewish Labor Committee refrained from voting on the Palestine Resolution at

the September Conference. The Committee's leaders are traditionally anti-

Zionist, but the organization has shifted to a non-Zionist stand because the

Jewish Socialists have found it expedient to ally themselves with the Labor

Zionists. (Poale-Zion) on many labor issues and on matters of domestic eco-

nomic policy: The Socialists have also been waging a bitter struggle with the

Communists in New York City over control of the American Labor Party, and

here they find it inexpedient to alienate the large group of Labor Zionists which

has always constituted a major element in the right-wing coalition to which

the Socialists belong. Should the Jewish Labor Committee nevertheless reai-

firm its traditional opposition to Zionism and resign from the Conference (a

development which some observers believe possible) this would bring the most

serious blow which the Zionists have had to face to date.

more extreme Zionist position.

- :

This development is not confined to the American Zionist scene alone. The

attempted resignation recently of David Ben'Gurion as chairman of the

executive of the Jewish Agency for Palestine was part of the same trend. Ben-

Gurion has been demanding more direct action and a militant program; in-

cluding the creation of a Jewish Army, non-cooperation with the Palestine

Government, and active resistance to Britain's policy of curtailing immigration.

This latest resignation, Ben-Gurion's third since the beginning of the war and,

like the others, rejected, appears to be a direct challenge to the more moderate

leadership of Dr. Chaim Weizmann for the control of Zionist policies.

"The Revisionists

Ben-Gurion's current position has led to frequent rumors

that he may join forces with the most extreme wing of the Zionist movement

represented by thè New Zionist Organization, commonly known as the Revision-

ists. This group, founded by the late Vladimir Jabotinsky, has steadfastly de-

manded the establishment of a Jewish State in Palestine, to which it insists

the Transjordan should be joined. The Revisionists have remained outside of

the World Zicnist Organization, have refused all cooperation with other

Zionist groups. Their American adherents would not participate in the recent

American Jewish Conference.

Numerically weak, with no more than several hundred sapporters in the

- United States the New Zionist Organization has during the past few years

been vociferous out of all proportion to its actual strerigth. Its activities in this

country are being directed by a delegation of Palestinians, headed by Peter

Bergson and including Eri Jabotinsky, son of Vladimir, and Alexander Hadani

By setting up a number of committees and frequently placing in the American

press full page advertisements, the Revisionists have kept their activities in

the public eye and before American legislators from whom they have won en-

dorsements. The Committee for a Jewish Army of Stateless and Palestinian

Jews, the. Emergency Committee te save the Jewish People of Europe, the

American Resettlement Committee for Uprooted Jewry, and a newest venture,

the American Legion for a Free Palestine which seeks as members 1,000,000 Jews

and non-Jews-all of these groups through interlocking leadership are Revi-

sionist-sponsored and are connected with the New Zionist Organization, Funds

for their vigorous propaganda campaign have come from a few rich backers,

including, it is believed, a number of anti-British Gentiles. Their advertise-

ments, which invariably carry a fund-soliciting coupon, are thought to be

self-sustaining.

While the general trend of Zionist political policy as manifested at the

American Jewish Conference has now become almost indistinguishable from

the demands of the Revisionists, the latter maintain independence of action.

Zionist circles in the United States have mildly criticized the publicity tactics

of the Revisionists, but they have done little to attempt to control them. It is

believed, however, that the most recent activities of this group may cause a

• change in the official Zionist policy toward it. A pilgrimage, sponsored by the

Revisionists, of some 500 Orthodox rabbis to Washington on 7 October to

petition the President and Congress to rescue the Jews of Europe was viewed

with misgiving in many Zionist circles. The recent action of the Emergency

Committee to Save the Jews of Europe in sponsoring a Joint Resolution in

Congress which calls for the creation of a special commission to plan the rescue

of the Jews of Europe has finally brought the matter to a head. The American

Jewish Conference is now considering some action to indicate to the public that

these Revisionist-controlled committees represent only a small group of people

and are not authorized to speak for American Jewry.

THE COMMUNITY BOOK SHOP

The following is the partial text of an article

entitled "It's Your Store" that appeared or page four of

the April 12 - 30, 1972, edition of The "Quicksilver Times",

a Iormer Washington, D. C. (WDC), underground newspaper

published bi-weekly.

"The Community Bookshop is having

problems.

They do not stem from

police harrasment of governmental

piggery.

They grow from the fact

that somehow the people that the

bookshop serves have forgotten the

difference between a community ser

vice and a capitalist enterprise....

"The flow through the small room

at 2028 P Street, NW

is an amazing

phenomenon in itself.

The people

represent all age levels and many

socio-economic background. They

come with children and friends, and

go away with bags of books and but -

tons, but many of them missed the

community service in the process.....

"When the Community Bookstore was

started over a year ago, it moved

loosely towards providing books,

posters, and information at non-rip-

off prices.

basis, it was able to keep the over-

head low and the mark-up reasonable.

It thrived on community support, con-

stant feedback, and an influx of

volunteers.

"Today, the purpose is the same,

but the people seem

to be moving out

of that involvement.

The bookstore

exists on less than

half the neces-

sary people-hours.

There is

Little

participation on the part of the

community in deciding what kinds of

books are needed.

The Community

Bookstore is becoming, in the eyes

of many, a commercial

business, not

a comnunity project.

"In addition to problems within

the store itself, there is the ques-

tion of the second floor.

Several

months ago, the Community Bookstore

rented the second floor of the build-

ing on P Street. Its original pur-

pose was to provide the community

a space in which to do things to

gether.

To date it has been used

for group meetings, films, poetry

readings, a dance

performance, anc

a women's

art and crafts

display

sale.

Yet, much of the time this

space goes

unused simply because no

one has shown an interest in making

use of it.

Again it shows a

ten-

dency on the part of people in the

community to wait until things are

organized by others rather than feel-

ing an obligation to make things hap .

pen themselves.

anyone or anything that needs a

space

to happen in, tell them about

the second floor.

Just call ahead

to make sure it is

free and sche-

dule a happening.)

THE COMMUNITY BOOK SHOP

The following is the partial text of an article

entitled "It's Your Store" that appeared on page four of

the April 12 - 30, 1972, edition of The "Quicksilver Times",

a former Washington, D. C. (WDC), underground newspaper

published bi-weekly.

"The Community Bookshop is having

problems.

They do not stem from

police harrasment of governmental

piggery.

They grow from the fact

that somenow the people that the

bookshop serves have forgotten the

difference between a community ser-

vice and a capitalist enterprise....

"The flow through the small room

at 2028 P Street, NW is an amazing

phenomenon in itself.

The people

represent all age levels and many

socio-economic background. They

come with children and friends, and

go away with bags of books and but-

tons, but many of them missed the

community service in the process.....

"When the Community Bookstore was

started over a year ago, it moved

loosely towards providing books,

posters, and information at non-rip

off prices.

basis, it was able to keep the over-

head low and the mark-up reasonable.

It thrived on community support, con-

stant feedback, and an influx of

volunteers.

"Today, the purpose is the same,

but the people seem to be moving out

of that involvement.

The bookstore

exists on less than

half the neces-

sary people-hours.

There is little

participation on the part of the

community in deciding what kinds of

books are needed.

The Community

Bookstore is becoming, in the eyes

of many, a commercial

business: not

a community project.

"In addition to problems within

the store itself, there is the ques-

tion of the second floor.

Several

months ago, the Community Bookstore

rented the

second floor of the build-

ing on P Street.

Its original pur-

pose was to provide the community

a space in which to do things to

gether.

To date it has been used

for group meetings, films, poetry

readings, a dance periormance, ano

a women's

art and crafts display/

sale. Yet, much of the time this

space goes

unused simply because no

one has shown an interest in making

dency on the part of people in the

community to wait until things are

organized by others rather than feel-

ing an obligation to make things hap

pen themselves. (If you know of

anyone or anything that needs a

space to happen in, tell them about

the second Il0or.

Just call ahead

to make sure it is tree and sche-

dule a happening.)

THE COMMUNITY BOOK SHOP

"The idea that the bookstore is

somehow removed from the community

must be done away with if it is to

improve and provide an adequate

service.

People must begin to rea-

lize that when the bookstore speaks

of what "we" want to do,

or what

"we" are, it is not talking just

about the people who work and ac-

tively participate in

the

shop, but

about all the customers and friends

who come and go. It is only through

this active participation that the

bookstore can become a viable com

munity project.

It is only with the

help of the people that the Commu-

nity Bookshop can serve the people."

"More important to the shop than

proilts, say its coordinators, is the

progress it is making in helping the

community whose members share in

accisions about the shop's operations.

The second floor has been made

available for poetry readings, dance

performances, craft aisplays,

men's

encounter sessions, women's liberation

meetings, and political films..

The

second floor also serves as a distri-

bution center for GLUT, a cooperative

food. buying service, and a classroom

for education courses.

"By sponsoring books sales and rock

concerts, The Community Book Shop has

raised several thousand dollars which

it has donated to causes such as Gay

Pride Weeks

Peace Action Coalition,

and Liberation News Service.

"Occasionally, there are disagree-

ments among the shop volunteers about

the causes which the shop should support.

Last month, for example, at a meeting

which brought over 200 persons to the

shop, it was decided the store could

not support the Venceremos Brigade

because the group, which annually goes

to Cuba to help harvest the sugar

crop, refuses to accept gay workers."

The RU literature ordered by Rosenfeld for the Book-

shop included copies of the RU publication entitled, -The Reo

50 copies of "The Red Papers 2" and 100 copies of "The Red

Papers 3".

Rosenfeld enclosed payment to RU for a previous

order by check in the amount $8.75 and drawn on the account

of the Washington Circle Community Bookshop. The check was

signed by David Marcuse.

On March 10, 1971, representatives of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation (FBI) interviewed David Marcuse.

agents, Marcuse stated in part that he was the owner of The

Community Bookshop, 2028 P Street,

The bookshop had been open at its present location

for two weeks and was financially self-supporting.

He invited

the interviewing agents to browse his shop, declared he was

WDC, had recently contacted the RU at San

Francisco, California, and requested a list of the literature

available from Ru and these publications' bulk costs.

On March 15, 1971, a third source furnished a

flyer that had circulated in new left circles in WDC during

March, 1971.

This flyer indicated that The Community Bookshop

the Pilgrims, 22nd and P Streets, N. W., WDC, Ior the purpose

of raising funds.

The flyer indicated that participants would

IT'S RESPONSIVE

2

134

Leftist Book Shop

By KIKI LEVANTES

Stai•. is Staff Writer

Feminist Press, Book People, and Time

Change Press.

The sales manager - no matter how

good he has been — still loses his job in

six months and his friends and co-workers

pick a new boss.

THE SHOP IS ALSO one of the city's

few book stores with complete sections on

women's liberation publications and the

systematic change in manage-

ment is to assure that The Community

Book Shop,

2038 P Street, NW is respon-

sive to the community.

There is also a constant turnover

among the 15 to 20 volunteers who staff

the shop - students, teachers, lawyers,

musicians and writers. Unexpected help

comes along occasionally, said one volun-

teer working at the store last weck, in the

"runaway kids and people the

police are looking for.

The Community Book Shop, operated

by three "coordinators" has done well in

the 16 months it has been oven. It has

lowered its initial debt of $20,000 incurred

the purchase of the store to under

12.000 books and over a thousand periodi-

shop has cone $87,957 worth of

since its opening,

according to

the first financial statement released'

in

March.

"IF IVE HAD TO PAY all our bills

right now, we couldn't. But we send our

publishers enough to keep them happy and

keep the orders coming in," said Will, one

of the coordinators. (The staff is known -

even among themseives - only by their

first names, because, they sav, they are

connections with the book

shop, which primarily sells left-wing politi-

cal literature and has become a center for

counter-culture in the city, might be dam-

aging to their professions.)

In a little over a year, The Community

Book Shop has established a reputation as

one of the city's best sources of social-

ist. and communist political publications.

The shop carries books by well-known pub-

lishers such as Random House, Simon and

Schuster, and McGraw-Hill.

also newer houses, such as International

Publishers of New York, which

books from Russia, and China Book and

Periodicals, Inc. of San Francisco, which

chrries the latest works from the People's

Republic of China.

The shop also has a selection of publi-

cadions from the so-called counter-culture

presses: the New England Free Press, the

A growing children's section includes

cultural coloring books on Japan, Africa.

and the American Indian from Bellero-

phon Books of San Francisco. There are

also books which attempt to redefine sex-

ual roles for young children, such *s "The

Challenge to Become a Doctor," a biogra-

phy of Elizabeth Blackwell.

More important to the shop than prof-

its, say its coorcinators, is the progress it

the community

whose members share in decisions about

the shop's operations. The second floor has

been made avalable for poetry readings,

dance periormances, crait displavs, men's

encounter sessions,

and political films. The second

floor also serves as a distribution center

for GLUT, a cooperative food buying serv-

ice, and a classroom for education courses.

By sponsoring books sales

concerts, The Community Book Shop has

dollars which it

has donated to causes such as Gay Pride

Week, Peace Action Coalition, and Libera-

tion News Service.

Occasionally, there are disagreements

among the shop volunteers about the caus-

es which the shop should support. Last

month, for example,

at a meeting which

brought over 200 persons to the shop, it

was decided the store could not support

the Venceremos Brigade because®

which annually goes to Cuba to

grop harvest the sugar crop, refuses to

accept gay workers.

PIlLOSOPIlICAL variances are just

one element in the magnetism of The

• Community Book Shop.

At noon, people gather on the steps to

eat their homemade lunches. Inside the

weathered townhouse they wander down

the narrow aisles or settle down on the

benches by the bay windows to read. Chil.

drift in and stare at wall posters

eversthing from the Russian

• révolution to womanhood's awakening and

the evils of strip mining.

And, in one corner a future coordina-

tor writes on a posted sheet of blank

"Norman Mailer is a sexist. Get him

out of our store. Sue."

On February 18, 1975,

a second source

advised that the participants of the demonstration

would gather in Lafayette Park across from the

White House at 9:30 AM on March 1, 1975, and that

some of the group would join the public

tour of the

White House and

possibly commit acts of civil

disobedience inside the White House.

On February 24, 1975, a third source made

available a leaflet which reflected that the following

persons would participate in the returning of clemency

their demonstration until about 11:15 AM at which

time they marched to the White House where the

demonstration was continued.

On March 1, 1975, a representative of the

United States Secret

the White House tour line were allowed to enter the

White House in small groups shortly after 11:30 AM.

Shortly after 12 noon, the tour line officially closed

and at that time, members of the March first Coalition

exited the white

and remained on the driveway

leading to the northeast exit of the White House grounds.

Shortly before 12:30 PM, those persons remaining on the

driveway were advised by

officers of the Executive

Protective Service (EPS) that the White House tour

had officially ended and that should the group decide

to remain on the driveway and not leave, the group

would be arrested. At that time, some of the members

did leave the driveway and the

White House grounds;

however, the majority of the group remained and sat

down. After a series of warnings, officers of the

Executive Protective Service began to arrest the members

of the March First Coalition who refused to leave

the White House grounds. As a result, sixty-one persons

all arrests had been completed,

the group of demonstrators on the White House sidewalk

dispersed without incident.

On April 22, 1975

before the U. S. El Paso student senate

at 7 p.m."

On November 10, 1969, EP T-I advised as follows:

NIX. DON LUCE, who said he served with the

International Volunteer

Services Program in Vietnam fron

1958 to 1967, gave a talk at the Union Theater of UTEP On

the night of November 7, 1969. The program was

sponsored

by the ATSC in El Paso, and the El Paso Moratorium Committee

at UTEP.

JOHN KARR, one of the leaders of the AFSC of

El Paso, was in attendançe at the gathering, as were RONALD E.

VINCENT and PHILLIPE C. LANGFORD, leaders of the SAC, a

recognized student group at UTEP which had engaged

in

anti-daft and anti-Vietnam war activities at UTIP in the

past.

There were about 50 to 15 people in attendance

at the gathering, including a number of soldiers from It.

Bliss, Texas.

Photographs were displayed at the gathering,

showing such things as a young Vietnam girl on crutches

with the lower

part of her leg removed, and small children

with mutilated

faces and bodies, some of whom had lost

limbs.

Some of

these photographs appeared to have been

photographs which had earlier appeared in Life magazine.

Mr. LUCE said that he had gone to Vietnam in

1958 as an Agriculturist to teach the Vietnamese people

• how to raise sweet potatoes, but had become tired

of

the

policies

of the United

States Government as of 1967. LUCE

described how a shot might be fired in the direction of

American soldiers, who would then fire on huts belonging

to civilians in the area.

LUCE was very critical of the Vietnam policy

of former President LYNDON B. JOHNSON, and President RICHARD M.

NIXON. He accused NIXON of escalating instead of de-escalating

the war in Vietnam, and said that NIXON had only brought out

a token force of U. S. soldiers from Vietnam.

LUCE pointed out how the U.S. Army was still

killing civilians in Vietnam. He stressed this point,

and said that we were killing or aiding in killing women and

children.

LUCE also said that the U.S. Army was turning

North Vietnam captives over to the

South Vietnamese, who

tortured the North Vietnamese captives to get information

from them and killed them if they did not furnish information.

LUCE said that the U. S. Governont was aiding and abetting

the south Vietnamese

Government, which was a corrupt

government. He said

the U.S. Government had facilitated

the assassination of the Catholic President of South Vietnann

who was

in power at the time that JOHN I. KENNEDY was

President.

LUCE indicated that he understood what the

North Vietnamese policy was, and what they were trying to

accomplish, and added that as long as the South Vietnamese

leaders remained in power, there probably would be no hope

for peace in Vietnam.

• LUCE said that soldiers at Ft. Bliss, Texas,

had tried to distribute leaflets at the U. S. Army Defense

Language Institute regarding his speech, but had

been

denied permission to do so by the Military Police at Ft.

Bliss.

After the meeting, some young men, believed to

oe soldiers from ft. Bliss,

placed

some photographs on the

ong tables in the lobby of the building. Most of the

photographs were of civilians and soldiers who

eyes open, and some were of women and children.

They were

propaganda against the war

in Vietnam. An individual wearing a jacket of Notre Dame

University

placed the photographs on the table. He was

told that he had no authority to place the photographs out for

display, and he then removed them, mumbling something to

the effect, "They don't want to see the truth."

PHILLIPE LANGFORD, mentioned above, and his

girl friend, made use of two U.S. Army garrison caps in

collecting contributions from those persons in attendance

at the gathering.

speaking engagement. At that tine, LUck agreed to write

a short article concerning Vietnam

for each future issue

of the "Gigline." LUCE furnished information to the GIFP

on how to establish contact with a peace group at the

University of Saigon.

In addition, EP T-2 advised that the GIFP

allowed GAIL CARTER, mentioned above, to distribute copies

November 8, 1969.

She distributed approximately 150

copies on that occasion, and collected $21 in contributions.
