On October 18, 1960, BRUNO advised T-4 that

he had arranged through Lloyds of London and an undisclosed

insurance agency to insure his gambling casino in Havana

for an unknown amount.

The insurance agent according to

BRUNO manipulated the papers so that BRUNO received $180,000.

had not been paid at the time of the fire. T-4 also stated

that MARIO MAGGIO told BRUNO recently that CAPPELLO (phonetic)

had been constantly trying to contact BRUNO about 'a
