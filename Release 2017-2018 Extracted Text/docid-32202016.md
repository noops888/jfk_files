expected to return

to Miami, Farida, escly in august, 1963.

MM T-? 1i1 BATISIA's trip to Central America

also served as a check on announcements made by former

President of Nicaragua LUIS SOMOZA, to the effect that

Nicaragua would give military help to the different

militant Cuban anti-Communist organizations. Comandos L

felt they san trust the judgment of BATISt, and planned

to later confer with him on hig return to the United

States.

It is noted that previous investigations has re-

flected that former Nicaraguan Prezident LUIS SOMOZA came

to the United States in July, 1963, and talked individually

and in groups 1= various Cuban exile leaders in the Miami

area.

Alse SOMOld reportedly conferred with various

officials of the United States goverment in Washington,

D.C. It was reported his conversations with the Cuban

exiles in the Miami area related to the possible establish-

ment of a base of operations for these Cubans in Nicaragua

or elsewhere in Central America, for preparationg to over-

throw the present government of Cuba.

On August 13, 1963, LAUREANO BATISTA FALLA,

1300 S. Bayshore Drive, Miami, advised he continues ag

the military head of the MDC, and that a week previously

he had been in Nicaragua on the invitation of former

Nicaraguan President LUIS SOMOZA. The purpose of BATISTA'&

visit to Nicaragua was to confer with SOMOZA concerning the

Cuban situation, and the possibility of aid to the -Cuban

exiles in crarthroiing the presint Caban government.

Nicaraguan claimed to be an army officer, and for years

to have been an assistant to General ANASTACIO SOMOZA

of Nicaragua.

This army officer acted tough, and left

no doubt he was a Nicaraguan military man.

He offered

to the MDC training camps, military equipment and

military bases in Nicaragua, from which Cuba could be

attacked. He did not indicate this plan had any

sanction or support of United States military officials.

This Nicaraguan claimed all expenses of moving MDC per-

sonnel and other Cuban exiles to Nicaragua would be

paid for, but the Cuban exiles would receive no salaries

while in military training camps or while fighting in

Cuba.

The Nicaraguan explained there are no Cubans

training in Nicaragua but that he had recently spoken to

ARTIME BUESA and BATISTA FALLA in Nicaragua concerning

this plan.

On August 13, 1963, MM T-4 advised that the plan

for MDC members to go to Nicaragua never materialized and

at the present time the MDC maintains no military train-

ing camps and does not participate in any military acti-

vities.

MM T-S, a member of the CRC, advised the CRC

continues to exist and the MDC faction of LUCAS continues

to belong to the CRC. MM T-5 explained that since the

CRC and the MDC have not received any United States govern-

ment subsidies since April, 1963, the CRC and MDC have

had no significant activity; barely continued to exist;

can hardly maintain operating expenses; are in debt and

the future is urcertain.
