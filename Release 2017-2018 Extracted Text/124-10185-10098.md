ALLEGED BELITTLING OF COMMUNISM BY ALLEN DULLES

In July, 1959, Allen Dulles of CIA spoke at the

National Strategy Seminar of the National War College. One

of the professors handling the Seminar was critical of Dulles.

He claimed that Dulles had belittled the importance of the

communist problem.

The above is being cited in the event we desire to

utilize the information in justifying a position that it was

necessary to be circumspect with CIA. (Memorandum W. C. Sullivan

STERE

On february 7, 1962; Colonel Sheffield Edwards,

Director of Security, CIA, informed the Liaison Agent that

CIA was preparing a report containing extremely sensitive

Information.

He stated that this information came from a

sensitive source and he was not certain as to how it should

be handled.

As a result of a discussion with Edwards on

February 26, 1962,

it was ascertained that CIA had maintained

a technical

surveillance onl

lover an extended period. S

Edwards explained

that he had been reluctant to identify this

•source at an earlier date because he feared that prosecution

could have been jeopardized and, furthermore, he did not want

his Agency embarrassed in the event the Bureau objected to

CIA maintaining a capability such as technical surveillances.

existence of the coverage.

The Director made the notation,

"I only wish we would eventually realize CIA can never be

depended upon to deal forthrightly with us.

Certainly my

skepticism isn't based on prejudice nor suspicion, but on

specific instances of all too many in number.' Yet, there

In February, 1962,

the Liaison Agent was requested

to discuss with CIA a

case which, in our opinion, clearly

indicated CIA had failed to keep us appropriately informed

of developments.

The Bureau's original interest was initiated

in Miami as a result of a discussion with CIA personnel in

that

city.

Attempts to get CIA replies via correspondence were

negative. On February 13, 1962,

the Liaison Agent discussed

the matter with CIA and received a reply which did not adequately

satisfy the Bureau's request. (Memorandum Donahoe to Sullivan,

CIA WIRE TAPPING IN THE UNITED STATES

Sometime prior to the Bay of Pigs fiasco, CIA had

become involved in a weird plan designed to bring about the

assassination of Fidel Castro:

One of the principal ingredients

of this plan was to be the utilization of U.S, hoodlums.

CIA

established contact with Robert Maheu, former Bureau Agent, who

served as the intermediary

in dealings with the notorious

hoodlum, Sam Giancana.

Information indicating that Mabeu was behind a wire tapping

operation in Nevada.

Potentially, there were elements for

possible violation of unauthorized publication or use of

communications.

However, prosecution was out of the question

because of the

tainted involvement of CIA.

In October, 1962, we lodged a protest with CIA

because the Agency initiated operation of Cuban agents in the

Miami area and in so doing violated Bureau jurisdiction.

the matter was turned over to the Bureau for

60• ALLEGED ATTACK ON BUREAU BY JOHN MCCONE

We received information in December, 1963, indicating

that John McCone, Director of CIA, allegedly was attacking the

Bureau in what would appear to be a vicious and underhanded

manner. McCone allegedly informed Congressman Jerry Ford and

Drew Pearson that CIA had uncovered a plot in Mexico City

Indicating that Lee Harvey Oswald had received $6,500 to

assassinate President Kennedy. The story attributed to McCone

appeared to be related to information which had come from one

Interrogation of

Alvarado, including a polygraph, disclosed that he had fabricated

his story.. This had been made known to CIA and to McCone.

There

fore, if McCone had made the above statements to Ford and

Pearson,

it would appear that it would have been an obvious attempt to

ridicule the Bureau:

The Liaison Agent contacted McCone on

December 23, 1963. McCone vehemently denied the allegations.
