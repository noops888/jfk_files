J. GRAFFAGNINI,

839 Bonnabel Boulevard upon his return from

Detroit, Michigan.

AT NEW ORLEANS; LOUISIANA. Interview IRVIN SURGI

upon his return from Lafayette, Louisiana, in November, 1969.

ADMINISTRATIVE:

On July 15, 1969, NO 1075-C advised he has borrowed

many times from the Rex Finance Company, and only recently

failed to make a payment on schedule, and someone at the com-

pany was giving him a bad crédit reputation.

Source therefore

went to JOE BOHRER and severly reprimanded him, possibly included

a threat, and left;

Later MORRIS LANSBURG called source in

and asked him to go

easy with BOHRER, indicating that he was

closely related and said "If you hurt him, you hurt me."

Source

advised that this LANSBURG is the same MORRIS LANSBURG that

previously brought sack full of money (bills) to CARACCI at

the amusement company office. The above was furnished to SA

L. M. SHEARER, JR.

On August 12, 1969, source advised that EMANUEL

LANSBURG, 544 Andrew Street, New Orleans, is LANSBURG who

brought large amount of bills in a bag to CARACCI as reported

in the past.

This LANSBURG was

present when CARACCI called

the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas

to get his gambling losses

back.

He told CARACCI not to worry about the losses when the

losses were being discussed befôre the telephone call. NO

1075-C has not observed MORRIS LANSBURG, former owner of the

Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas in connection with CARACCI.
