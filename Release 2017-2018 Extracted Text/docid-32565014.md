ReBulets 7/29 and 8/10/64.

It is to be noted that Phila. has encountered

technical difficulties in regard to PH 701-C* since its

installation.

SA J. ROBERT PEARCE on 8/18/64 ascertained that

the loss of volume was caused by a shortage of the installa-

tion within the Resident Agency in Wilkes-Barre.

This has

been remedied and it is hoped that the quality and quantity

of information received from this source will increase.

On 8/13/64 source furnished information that

BUFALINO was expected to be in New York on August 21.

Source also advised that BUFALINO had the feeling his

telephone was "tapped."

On 8/18/64, after correction of installation

source advised BUFALINO was in contact

At this time BUFALINO set up a

meet with this person for Friday morning:

On 8/21/64

source advised BUFALINO was to meet

WILLIAM BUFALINO JR., of Detroit, who according to PH 665-C-

TE is the son of WILLIAM BUFALINo, a detroit attorney who

has some connection with JAMES HOFFA.

Phila. Division will continue to submit weekly

summaries.
