Memorandum for Mr. Sullivan

RE:

MIRR

has learned that MIRR intends to utilize two boats

A large boat piloted by a Cuban captain will

rendezvous at sea with a smaller fast boat carrying the demolition

bombs which will have departed from the Homestead, Florida, area.

the bombs tall he loaded on the bigger boat which will then proceed

to Bimini.

Jis attempting to discreetly ascertain more details

concerning the exact identity of the boats and other personnel

involve it, to operation and the lant Office i8 maintaining c2080

Miami has previously suggested, and the Bureau has concurred,

that seizure by U. S. Customs of the boats involved as they are

departing Florida would be the most feasible way to stop this operation.

Under existing policy Customs will seize the boats and explosives

involved but the participants would not be arrested. Miami points out

that this procedure would afford adequate protection to our informant,

Mr• James I. Murphy, FAA, Washington, D. C., advised on

12-16-63 that he has been in contact with Mr. Jack Kinny, FAA official

in Miami. According to Mr. Murphy, Kinny has the authority to ground

the alicraft to be used in this raid under any number of pretexts and

at the request of our Miami Office Mr. Kinny would ground this aircraft

for technical reasons. Our Miami Office has established liaison with

Mr. Kinny and is being advised of the information furnished by Mr. Murphy.

Miami is following this matter closely with

and

will keep the Bureau, Customs and FAA advised of all pertinent details.

The information in attached teletype was telephonically

lisseminated 12-16-63 to Mr. Lester Johnson

Attorney John H. Davitt.

We are also advising the

military intelligen

agencies.

ACTION:

For information. We will continue to afford this matter

close attention.
