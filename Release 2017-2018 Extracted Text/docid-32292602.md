advised that one of the first

items of business of ALEX upon his return to Chicago

on July 23, 1968, was to arbitrate differences which

had arisen

during his absence between Chicago attorney

GEORGE BIEBER and ALEX's associate in organized crime,

FELIX

"Milwaukee Phil"

ALDERISIO.

The informant

noted that BIEBER fears that he is about to be

prosecuted by the United States Attorney's Office

and that ALDERISIO in return for a monetary con-

sideration guaranteed to BIEBER that he would not

be prosecuted.

The informant was unable to furnish

any information or further detals indicating

the

methods to be employed by ALDERISIO in his protection

Of BIEBER in this regard.

Information has been received from the

Swiss Federal Aliens Police on July 9, 1968, that

/ ALEX's appeal for a revocation of the

WSwiss

En try

Ban against him had recently been denied and

that

ALEX had no further recourse to have this ban

canceled. It is noted that the Swiss Government

banned ALEX from entry of Switzerland

for ten years

approximately three years ago.

Since

that time

ALEX has made several efforts to have this entry

ban against him lifted.
