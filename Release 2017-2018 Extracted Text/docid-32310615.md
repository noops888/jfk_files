RAMIREL now expects that he will be called to Havana to

explain about his resignation and hopes that he will, as

he will now, be able to say that he will continue working

but must have sufficient money on which to live.

stated that he estimated that he would need about $400.

and that if the question comes up in any disuession, that

Is the tigure that he will name. He said that he had just

driven the father of his good friend, FERNANDO FERNANDE

to the airport in Miami and had told him to tel! FERNANDO

the whole story

about himself and LEON. Also, he told him

to tell RAUL KOA, Cuban State Department head Clu

RAMIREZ stated that FERNANDEZ is a high official

in the Cuban State Department and was the person who"

obtained RAMIREz job for him.

FERNANDEZ has charge of

all the consulates in the world and serves as an inspector.

RAMIREZ feels that FERNANDEZ will take his part in any

trouble which may arise.

RAMIREZ stated that LEON received a reprimand

from RAUL ROA, Cuban head of the State Department because

recently LEON

has refused to validate the certificate which

those Cuban pensioners living in the United States have

signed in order to receive their pensions. One of these

which he refused to sign was

that of a Mis. ALEMAN, the

mother Of JOSE ALEMAN. JOSS

KLEMAN was the former owner of Fla

the Tradewinds Motel on Miant. Beach and at one time head

of the Cuban Revolutionary Organization, "Cuba Rebelde,"

and a pro revolutionary figure. Also, the ALEMAN family

had control of Aero Postal Airlines and were prominent

figures.

When the signing of her paper was refused, she

went to Cuba and made a complaint and it resulted in a

cablegram asking LEON what was the matter with him for

refusing to sign. This caused more trouble in the consulate.
