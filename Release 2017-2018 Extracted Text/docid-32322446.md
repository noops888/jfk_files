Details:

San Antonio has completed indices searches for any

124 10additional information related to President John F. Kennedy's

in San Antonio files pertaining to all of the names listed in the

reference communication with the exception of Lee Harvey Oswald.

Two references to the name Lee Harvey Oswald were

located. SA 62-0-19184 is missing

and it appears that this

document, which was indexed on 05/21/1987, has been destroyed

during routine file destruction procedures. The other reference,

SA 89-0-314, enclosed, is an airtel Irom houston to barlas,

05/14/1992, captioned

"Lee Harvey Oswald, aka; Assassination OI

John F. Kennedy, November 22, 1963, Dallas, Texas; AFO."

San Antonio also conducted a search of all SAC material

stored in this office without locating any documents pertaining

to the

President Kennedy assassination.

Due to the unavailability of the IIS Analyst, deadline

of 06/12/1998 was missed. On 06/09/1998 Carol Keeley was advised

that this deadline would be missed and she stated that it would

be sufficient to respond

as soon as possible after the IIS

Analyst returned.
