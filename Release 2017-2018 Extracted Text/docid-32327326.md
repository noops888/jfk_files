in her on many matters, with the exception of KANTOR's possible

Communist activities.

NATHALIE also knows of the KANTOR

family.

NATHALIE furnished the following information regarding

KANTOR:

LENORE KANTOR'S family are well aware that LENORE is

a Communist, and they are bitterly against Communism but their

love for LENORE keeps them from making her leave home.

They

often speak of how bad it is that LiNoRe, thinks as she does,

according to LENORE. LENORE's father, ABRAHAMAKANTOR, owns

the UNTIED PLUMBING AND SUPPLY COMPANY. LENORE'S mother, is

ROSE KANTOR. LENORE's two brothers are MARVIN KANTOR and NORMAN.

KANTOR.

MARVIN is partially paralysed and NORMAN once ran for

Plainfield City Council.

lives in Mexico, but a girl from the New York-New Jersey area

was going to marry him, names unknown. LENORE spends much of

her time distributing

the literature and booklets described

by ALFRED LILLY.

In the Fall of 1953, Mrs. LILLY told LENORE

that she (Mrs. LILLY) was going to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for

a visit. LENORE gave her $50.00 and told her to stop at

Chicago, Illinois,

and attend a conference. of the National

Negro Congress, which was being held there. Mrs. LILLY

registered at the conference but did not stay for the meetings.

Apparently, LINORE seems to have all the money she needs.

The Bureau's jurisdiction in Internal Security matters

was explained to the LILLYs.

Mrs. LILLY said that she

would continue friendly relations with LENORE and would see

if she could determine any of LENORE's activities in the field

of Communism, and would advise the Newark Office.

It is noted that LENORE KANTOR is the subject of an

SM-C investigation in the Newark Office, Bureau file 100-367098,

a member of the CP as late as 1950, at which time the informant

left the Party, and LENORE has been a member of the CP since

about 1945. The file also shows that she has recently been

In Mexico, where she met WALTERy LISLEY, alleged agent of

the Chinese Communist Government.

The information in the file corroborated the information

CONTACT WITH NATHALIE LILLY ON OCTOBER 12, 1954

On October 12, 1954, NATHALIE LILLY was contacted by

SAS BILL WILLIAMS and ROBERT J. KIRWAN to secure additional

information regarding her background. She advised that she is

1954, LENORE had brought a letter to her, which letter protested

against Universal Military Training. LENORE wanted her to

send the letter to the Editor of the Plainfield newspaper with

NATHALIE's name as the author.. NATHALIE told LENORE that she

would think it over.

NATHALIE advised that she does not think

she will send the letter to the editor as it might jeopardize

her position.

The Agents were impressed with NATHALIE's intelligence,

cooperation, and viewpoint, and feel that she is in a good

position to furnish information of interest to the Bureau,

especially regarding LENORE KANTOR. It is also felt that she

may be activated into the CP or a Communist front organization.

position to furnish information, inasmuch as LENORE KANTOR.

does not get along with him too

well.
