Title: JOHN F. KENNEDY RECORDS COLLECTION

ACT OF 1992 (THE ACT)

Synopsis:

Chicago requested by Task Force to respond to request

for files to be sent to the JFK Task Force.

Details: Per request of EC to Chicago dated 4/18/97, Chicago was

requested to send in the original serials as follows:

92-350 Sub D Serial 45? (dated 11/20/61)

92-350 Sub D Serial 45? (dated 11/15/61)

A search of the Chicago Division's files by PS Trecek

did not locate the above mentioned serials.

The search included

all serials beginning with 430 thru 470 contained in the Sub D

volumes.

These dates were not located. It is possible that

these serials were contained in the sub D volumes previously sent

to FBIHQ, JFK Task force. Chicago has put these serials on

"special locate".
