1.

I. Lloyd TRULI, 281 KIng St Klagston, Institute wee

Principal, Kingston, Colleglate and Vocational

Interviewed and he advised that he was aware of the facts

surrounding Mrs. Patricia BOWEN'S husband.

Mrs. BOWEN 1s

presently on the teaching staff at Queen Elizabeth Colleglate

and Vocational Institute, Kingston, Ont. being the head of the

Classics Department.

TRULI advised that Mrs. BOWEN was a

close friend of Mr. Vernon READY, former Principal of Kjagston

Collegiate and Vocational Institute.

In the summer of

1964

the READYS moved to London,

Ont. and since this time Mrs. BOWEN

has been in constant contact with ir. TRULL.

He also advised

that he had been introduced to John GROSSI, who was using the

name Jack BOweN, during the summer of 1904.

This took place

at the home of Vernon READY: where the BOWEN'S were visiting.

Since the READYSShave moved from the Kingston area Patricia

BOWEN has been a close friend of Mr. TRULLS and 1t would appear

that she would confide in him should her husband contact her or

have any of his friends do the same.

2.

TRULI aslo advised that Mrs. BOWEN 18 residing at 36

Ellerbeck Ave., Angston with her

two year old son and her

mother, who babysits while she works.

She is highly regarded

as a teacher by her superiors and there is no indication that

she is involved with her husband in any way.

She associates

with a small group of personal friends, these being mostly

fellow teachers.

BOWEN would proceed with divorce action should she be able

get in contact with her husband.

3.

William TATTON, 34 Ellerbeck Ave., Kingston, onto, Classi.

rication Officer, Kingston Penitentiary, who 1s well known to a11

members of this detachment, was interviewed in regards to the

possibility that he had noticed an American car in the vicinity

of 36 Ellerbeck Ave.

He advised that he could not recall any

such vehicle in the last few months but stated that he would

notify this office should he notice anything that might indicato

that GROSSI was in the area.

TATTON also faintly remembers

QROSSI as an inmate at Kingston Penitentiary.

4.

From the results of this investigation It would appear

that Patricia BOWEN 1s no longer interested in or corresponds

with her husband-andwould-_therefore not be involved 1n h1s--

activitles or his friends.

There 1s every indication that

should GROSSI return to this area and contact his wife she would

advise TRULL of same.

TRULL 18 co-operating to the fullest

extent with this Force.

CON"T FROM PAGE ONE

No enquiries were mado at Patricia BOWEN'S present

place of employment as TRULL indicated that a very 11m1ted

number of people know about her husband and it may cause

embarassment for her should too many find out.

It w111

be noted that TRULL has helped members of this detachment in

the past and at all-times has supplied good Information.

further enquiries will be carried out at this point, however,

should information in this regard come to light same will

be reported.
