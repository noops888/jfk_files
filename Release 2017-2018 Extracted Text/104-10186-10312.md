The Cuban

foreigr intelligence service, the General Directorate of

Intelligence (Direccion General de Inteligencia - DGI), in dis-

charging its functior of protecting Cuban interests and security

and promosing the pollgass of the Cuban Government, employs agents

ot many nationalities.

Although its activities extend to Europo

and Afrloa, its principal agent strength is in Latin America.

Agents kave ir veneral two types of assignments:

collection

the local government and the local situation,

promotion of revclutionary activity, including guerrilla variare.

abrond ars therefore divided into

intelligence agents charged

collection of erformation

and penetration of local governments and

organizations, who are truly clandestine, l.e., are not known in

their carget ecuntries as Cuban agents; and guerrilla warfare and

agents, charged with directing and supporting revolution

ary activities,

who are often known as Cuban agents to the local

Communist and leftist groups with which they work.

The tro types

of agents are trained

separately and are controlled by different

DGl neadquarters in Havana, intelligence agents

by the Illegal Department (Departamento Ilegal, Called Ilegal)

querrilla agents by the LY or National Liberation Department.

Intelligence (illegal) agents, from whatever source they are drawn

or organizations abroad, or guerrilla

kept from contact with

A foreton agent candidate arriving in Cuba is first debriefed by

the case officer on his background and qualifications,

to that time the DGI has only advance notice of his selection and

knows little about him.

The interview is recorded, but without

the trainee's knowledge.

On one occasion in early 196% a case

officer arranged to meet a new trainee in a Havana restaurant for

the preliminary interter.

The case officer provided himself with.

a pocket tape recorder, which he tested in advance and found was

in good order. When he started to record the interview, however,

he discovered that he had cither forgotten to adjust the mechan-

press and its type and circulation, urban and rural transporta-

In cases where an intelligence agont is selected from

guerrilla trainees, he may romain ulder the jurisdiction of the

IN Department, which retains him as a guerrilla agent but arranges

for his training as an illegal agint also.

Training for intel

ligence work, however, is always sepandte for guerrilla training

not revealed to the Communist Party or leftist group

agent in guerrilla activities and

a clandestine Agent in Intel

One such agent, trained in

Cuba in 1963, was returned to the Dominican Republic about mid-

1963; he carries on revolutionary activities with the Dominican

Cuban-trained guerrilla and at thr

If agents are not able to leave Cuba at once when they have com

pleted their training, they remain under the orders of the school

illegal agents.

They are permitted to travel in Cuba or are

assigned to public "voluntary" campaigns; the case officers try

to keep then busy, partly, at least, as a security precaution.

especially into the Central American area and to the north coast

of Suuth America.

Since

1962;

however.

the practice of sending

agents home as crowmen has

materially declined and in 196% was

used only occasionally.

Effectiveness of Training

36.

The capabilities of both guerrilla and illegal agents trained by

the DGI vary greatly because of differences in background, native

capacity, and adjustnent to discipline.

The DGI has successfully

trained a few highly efficient agents,

but some of its trainees

have not come up to expectations.

One agont with an excellent

training record, of whom the case officer had high hopes, was

arrested for participation in illegal

activities after only a

short period of operation following his return home.

Several

agents

who were

considered promising proved disappointing when

released from

training supervision; one who was given funds to

purchase a radio spent

the morey on himself and was in trouble

with the group with which he was affiliated because of his lack

of discipline; another was accused of having misused funds en

trusted to him for arms procur-ment and was also distrusted by

his group as cowardly and spiritless.

As noted above, instruc-

tion in secret writing has nor always been productive

of readable

reports.

The main difficulty appears to lie

not with the quality

of the training but with the lack of discipline and loyalty of

the trained agent.

Headquarters Comments

For a discussion of the organization of the DGI and the

functions

of its departmints, from the same source, see

CS-311/00115-6-.

Cuba has diplomatic relations, and hence consulates, in

Latin America only in Mexico

and Jamaica (relations

were

maintained with Brazel until May 1964, with Chile unti

July 1964, with Bolivia until August 1964, and with

Uruguay until September 1961).

Visas for Cuba can be

obtained only in those countries; most are issued in

Mexico, because that country has the only direct air

connection with Cuba.

3. Cuban handling of visas and documentation is discussed

at length by the same

source in CS-311/00866-64.
