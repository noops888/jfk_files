Assaulting A Federal Officer

This is in reference to your memorandum to the Attorney General of

August 17, 1967, regarding Carlos Marcello. Specifically, you state your

belief that Narcello should be brought to trial at, the earliest possible date.

As you are aware, Special Agent Collins was assaulted by Marcello

on September 30, 1966, and one week later, on October 7, 1966, the matter was

presented to a grand

jury in New Orleans and an indictment was returned.

Thereafter, on November 9, 1966, Marcello was arraigned and plead

not guilty.

Subsequent thereto, on December 19, 1966, Marcello's attorney,

Jack Wasserman of Washington, D. C., filed numerous pre-trial motions, includ-

ing one to dismiss the indictment on the basis that the grand jury was improp-

erly inpanelled within the purrier of Rabinovitz V. Untted States, 366 F.24

34 (5th Cir. 1966).

This office, and that of the United States Attorney In New Orleans,

reached the legal conclusion that Wasserman would very probably prevail on

the motion. As a result, United States Attorney Louis C. LaCour personalls:

held a series of conferences with the Court in New Orleans, whereupon It was

agreed that a new system for the impanelling of grand and petit juriet would

Ibe instituted by the Clerk of Court.

A new system was initiated in early 1967 and by the latter part of

May, 1967, had progressed to the point where a new grand jury was impanelled.

Very shortly thereafter,

on June 1, 1967, the new grand jury returned a super-

seding indictment in this matter.

The original indictment was dismissed on

June 5, 1967.

Wasserman, in turn, on June 28, 1967, filed numerous pre-trial

motions to the superseding indictment.

We, in turn, noticed the motions for

hearing on August 4, 1967.

Wasserman moved for a continuance based upon a

cormitment in Hawaii in connection with a conference of the American Bar

Association.

fon September 13, 1967. REC 6

are now noticed for hearing

I think you will agree that we have, in fact,

made every conceivable

effort to get this matter to trial at the earliest possible date.

But we have reached
