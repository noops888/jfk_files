III. GAMBLING INTERESTS:

A.

HORSE RACING

The following investigation was conducted by

Agents of the Chicago Office:

On July 2, 1964, FRANK CROSBY, head of the recently

organized Illinois Race Track Commission Police, was contacted

for any information he might have as to any race track

holdings in Illinois by CHESLER. CROSBY advised that a

review of his records failed to indicate any holdings by

CHESLER and that contacts with persons familiar with Illinois

race track personnel were not aware of

any rumors as to

CHESLER holding any undisclosed interest in any Illinois

tracks.

MM I-2 was contacted on several occasions

during June and July, 1964, relative to information

reflecting contact by LOUIS CHESLER with Chicago hoodlums,

SAM GIANCANA and LESLIE EARL KRUSE, and possible connections

of these individuals with the Lucayan Beach Casino.

The

informant advised that he had heard no additional

information indicating any current contact between these

individuals and LOUIS CHESLER.

directors of the Grand Bahamas Development Corporation

announced that they would include certain members, and

it was noteworthy that the name of LOUIS CHESLER was

omitted

as a member of the board of directors.

No

additional information has been received reflecting

any change in the status of the corporation or the

Bahamas Amusement Corporation, Lta.

In the July 26, 1964 issue of "The Miami News',

Miami, Florida, an article captioned GRAND BAHAMA MOLDS

A TOURIST PARADISE by LARRY BIRGER, business editor,

reportedly sets forth a telephonic communication with

LOUIS CHESLER at the Duke Medical Center in North

Carolina. It was reported that CHESLER continues to be

a patient at the Duke Medical Center, and is expected to

remain there until the fall of 1964. Mention was made

in the article that CHESLER resigned as president

and

director of the Grand Bahama Development Corporation,

and as head of the Grand Bahama Amusement Company, Ltd.

CHESLER is quoted as saying that "I coulh't very well

run the company from here." He was commenting, of course,

on his current stay at the Duke Medical Center in North

Carolina.

IV.

until the fall of 1964.

There has been no information

reported concerning any contacts on the part of CHESLER

with known hoodlums since he has been taken ill.
