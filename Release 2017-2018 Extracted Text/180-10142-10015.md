RELEASE OF THIS DOCUWENT

Purpose and Scope of Study

The Central Intelligence Agency's performance

in its role of support to the Warren Commission

has been a source of controversy since the

inception of the Warren Commission. Critics

have repeatedly. charged that the CIA participated

in a conspiracy designed to suppress information

relevant to the assassination of President Kennedy•

During 1976 the critic's

assertions were the subject of official inquiry

by the Senate Select Committee to Study

Governmental Operations (hereinafter SSC). The

SSC, in its report regarding "The Investigation

of the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy:

Performance of the Intelligence Agencies" reached

the following conclusion:

The Committee emphasizes that it has

not uncovered any evidence sufficient

to justify a conclusion that there was

a conspiracy to assassinate President

Kennedy.

The Committee has, however, developed

evidence which impeaches the process

by which the intelligence agencies

arrived at their own conclusions

about the assassination, and by

which they provided information

to the Warren Commission.

This

evidence indicates that the

the CIA, as well as other agencies

tion/ (SSE, Fork I, P6)

This

committee has sought to examine in

greater detail the general findings of the SSC.

The Committee has particularly focused its attention

on the specific issue of whether the CIA or any

employee or former employee of the CIA misinformed,

or withheld information relevant to the assassina-

tion of President Kennedy from the Warren

Commission.

In addition, the Committee has

attempted to determine whether, if the Warren

Commission

was misinformed or not made privy to

information

relevant to its investigation,

the misinforming or withholding of

evidence from the Warren Commission was the

result of a conscious intent to do so by the

Agency or its employees.

The Committee has

sought to examine the

issue detailed above in both an objective

and disciplined manner.. In order to accomplish

this goal the Committee has utilized a 1977

Stask Force

Report by the CIA's Inspector General (hereinafter

TEK

77 IGR). This Report was highly critical of

the SSC findings and asserted that the SSC

Final Report conveyed an impression of limited

effort by the CIA to assist the Warren Commission

in its work. the 77 tok was in fundamental

disagreement with this characterization of the

SSC findings and noted that "CIA did seek and

coliect information in support of the walken

commission. Additionally t

conducted studies

In examining the Agency's comprehensive

the Committee has paralled its review to the

TFR

structure given to these materialsby the 77 IR.

In this regard the 77 IGR details four inter-

related compilations of Kennedy assassination

These four compilations are:

1) Agency dissemination of information

to the Intelligence Community (Formal

and Informal Disseminations)

2) Dissemination of material to the

In reviewing these compilations,

the Committee

focused upon those

CIA materials which the 77 rak documented

as having

made available in written form to the Warren

During the course of this study, additional

Agency files have been reviewed.. These files have

been examined in an effort to resolve certain

issues created by the review of the Agency's

compilations discussed in this report. Where

apparent gaps existed in the written record,

files have been requested and reviewed in an effort

to resolve these gaps. Where significant substantive

and

reviewed in an effort to resolve these issues.

As a result, approximately thirty files, comprising

an approximate total of ninety volumes of

material have been examined and analyzed

in preparation of this report.

The findings set forth herein are subject

to modification due to the following considera-

tions. During the course of the past fifteen

years, the CIA has generated massive amounts of

information related to the assassination of

President Kennedy. In spite of the Agency's

sophisticated document retrieval system, certain

documents requested by this Committee for study

and analysis have nöt been located. Whether these

documents merely have been filed incorrectly or

destroyed, gaps in the written record still do

exist.

Therefore,

this study's conclusions are based upon the

this may not be all relevant evidence to which

the Agency

One must, moreover, give due consideration

to the role that oral discussions, oral briefings,.

I. Organization of CIA Investigation

of President Kennedy's Assassination

In his Executive Session testimony before the Select

Committee, Richard Helms, the CIA's Deputy Director for

Plans during 1963, described the CIA's role in the

investigation of President Kennedy's assassination as

follows:

This crime was committed on United

States soil. Therefore, as far as the

Federal government was concerned, the pri-

mary investigating agency would have been

the Federal Bureau of Investigation without

any question. The role of the CIA would

have been entirely-supportive in the sense

of what material we are (sic) able to

acquire outside the limits of the United

States with reference to the investigation.

... For investigative purposes, the Agency

had no investigative role inside the United

States at all. So when I used here the

word "supportive," I meant that in the

literal sense of the term. We are (sic)

trying to support the FBI and support the

Warren Commission and be responsive to

their requests, but we were not initiating

any investigations of our own or, to my

recollection, were we ever asked to.

(Executive Session Testimony of Richard

Helms, 8/9/78, pp. 17-18.)

On November 23, 1963 Helms called a meeting of senior-

level CIA officials to outline the Agency's investiga-

tive responsibility vis a vis the assassination. (SSC,

Book V, p. 25.) At that time, Helms placed John Scelso,

Branch Chief for CIA operations in Mexico, Central

America, and Panama, in charge of the Agency's initial

investigative efforts. (HSCA Class. Deposition of John

of Richard Helms, 8/9/78, p. 10.)

Scelso testified before the Select Committee,

that he was given charge of the Agency's investigation

on the basis of two considerations: 1) ' his prior

experience in conducting major CIA security investi-

gations and 2) the observance of Oswald by CrATel to

surveitlance in Mexico, (Scelso's operational concern)

less than two months prior to the assassination. (SSC

Book V,. p. 25, HSCA Class. Deposition of John Scelso,

5/16/70, pp. 111-112. i Scelso also noted that

investigation "and the key stations were receiving

Kennedy's assassination. (Ibid

During the latter half of December, Scelso

issued

a summary report which described Oswald's

Helms' reasoning was expanded upon by Raymond

in part by the establishment of the warren Commission.

*The following exchange between Mr. Rocca and Committee

Counsel sheds further light on the difficulties encountered

by the Agency related to its investigation of possible

Cuban involvement in the assassination:

Mr. Goldsmith.

Earlier, when I asked you which

areas of the case received emphasis, I believe that you

indicated that on balance the primary area of emphasis

was the Soviet connection.

Mr. Rocca.

That was certainly the one that I would

say dominated -- looking at it from my point of view.

Mr. Goldsmith. Now, had you known about the anti-

Castro assassination plots on the part of the CIA, would

you have given

more priority, more emphasis, to the

possibility of a Castro conspiracy to kill the President?

Mr. Rocca.

Again, I say that it would have

simply intensified it, that there was attention given

to it, not particularly by the staff. I had no capabilities

on the Cuban side.

The organization of their service and their

operation in Mexico was something entirely entirely (sic)

within -- it was an enigma at the time.

They were just

getting started. This was Wit's area.

This was Wit

Seottis area of proficiency.

So the defectors had only

begun to come out and they came out later, the Cuban

defectors.

So, I can't -- I really can't say that (a) the

Cuban connection

was ignored, because it wasn't. The

press was filled with it at the time.

•.-.

The Harker interview should have been undoubtedly

given greater attention in a generalized sense; but it

was given specific attention, I was told at the time of

the Rockefeller thing.

Mr. Goldsmith. In what way was the Cuban connection

investigated?

Mr. Rocca. I don't know. I don't know this.

That side of the report strikes me as being inadequate.

Mr. Goldsmith.

Well, when I said to what extent

was the Cuban connection investigated, I don't mean by

the Warren Commission. I mean to what extent did the

Agency provide --

Mr. Rocca. That I can't answer. I certainly

didn't do it.

Mr. Goldsmith. Pardon me?

Mr. Rocca.

We certainly didn't, in R& A.

Mr. Goldsmith. So, CI/R & A did not --

Mr. Rocca.

Go into the Cuban side of it at all.

This was something left to the people who were concerned

specifically with Cuban intelligence and security operation.

Mr. Goldsmith. But I believe earlier we

established that Mr. Helms gave orders that information

pertinent to the assassination was to go through your

office, correct?

Mr. Rocca.

Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. And once information pertinent

to the assassination went through your office, I take (it)

you or Mr. Helms would decide what information would

be relevant for the Warren Commission to see.

Is that correct?

Mr. Rocca.

Well

Mr. Goldsmith. Based upon what you knew?

Mr. Rocca.

Well, everything would go, yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Therefore, you were in the

position, it would seem, to know

what information was

being generated in the field that was going to the

Warren Commission.

Earlier I asked you which area received emphasis

and I believe you indicated that the Soviet area (did).

Mr. Rocca.

Primarily, primarily. But I didn't

mean by that that it excluded the Cuban, because there

was a lot of material that came through and went to the

Commission that concerned the Cubans.

Mr. Goldsmith. Let's go off the record.

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Goldsmith. Let's continue.

Mr. Rocca. My recollection is that at the time

the great press manifestation was that Cuban exiles who

were in touch with CIA had been somehow involved in this.

This was the great concern.

Mr. Goldsmith. That's another possibility.

There are different --

Mr. Rocca. Questions went down to WH: do you

have anybody who could possibly have gotten involved in

this kind of thing.

There was extraordinary diligence, I thought,

exercised to try to clarify that side.

Mr. Goldsmith.

Do you think that the possibility

of an assassination plot by Castro against the President

was adequately investigated?

(Pause)

Mr. Rocca. With the advantages of 20-20 hind-

sight, I could say probably not.

But at the time it seems

to me that they gave due attention to it - within the

information that I had at my disposal.

A. Opinions of Warren Commission and CIA Representatives

Regarding Warren Commission-CIA Relationship

The Committee has contacted both representatives of

the Warren

Commission staff and those representatives of

the CIA who played significant roles in providing CIA-

generated information to the Warren Commission.. The

general consensus of these representatives is that the

Warren Commission and the CIA enjoyed a successful

working relationship during the course of the Commission's

investigation. (HSCA Class. Depo. of R. Rocca 7/17/78,

• p. 18) (See also Exec. Sess. Test. of Richard Helms,

-8/9/78, p. 24.) William Coleman, a senior staff counsel

for the Warren Commission who worked closely with Warren

Commission staff counsel W. David Slawson on matters

which utilized the CIA's resources, characterized

the CIA representatives with whom he dealt as

highly competent, cooperative, and intelligent.

(See HSCA staff interview of William Coleman,

8/2/78.) Mr. Slawson expressed a similar opinion

regarding the Agency's cooperation and quality

Mr." Rocca

added that, to his knowledge, Mr. Helms'

orders were followed to the letter by all CIA employees.

'(Ibid.

) Mr. Rocca concluded that on this basis:

"the CIA was to turn over and to develop any information

bearing on the assassination that could be of assistance

to the Warren Cormission." (Ibid., p. 26.)

A different view of the CIA's role regarding the

supply of CIA's information to the Warren Commission was

propounded by Richard Helms. Mr. Helms, who served as

the CIA's Deputy Director for Plans during the Warren

Commission investigation, was directly responsible for the

CIA's investigation of President. Kennedy's assassination and the

establishment of ClA potiay visa ris the Warren Commission.

(Ibid., p. 23.)

He testified to the Committee that the

CIA made every effort to be as responsive as possible to

Warren Commission requests. (Exec. Sess. Text. of Richard

Helms, 8/9/78, p. 10.) Mr. Helms added further testimony

regarding the manner in which the CIA provided its infor-

mation to the Warren Commission. He stated:

An inquiry would come over (from the warren Com-

mission).

We would attempt to respond to it.

But these inquiries came in individual bits and

pieces or as individual items...Each individual

item that came along we took care of as best we

V

could. (Ibia., pp. 10-11.)

However, it was Mr. Helms' recollection that the CIA

provided information to the Warren Commission primarily

000032

---

## Page 36

- 12

on the basis of the Commission's specific requests. Under

oath he supported this proposition:

Mr. Goldsmith:

In summary, is it your position that

the Agency gave the Warren Commission

information only in response to speci-

fic requests by the Warren Commission?

Mr. Helms:

That is correct.

I want to modify that by saying that

memory is fallable.

There may have been

times or circumstances under which some-

thing different might have occured, but

my recollection is that we were attempting

to be responsive and supportive to the

FBI and the Warren Commission.

When

they asked for something we gave it to

them.

As far as our volunteering information

is concerned, I have no recollection of

whether we volunteered it or not.

(Ibia., p. 34.)

Mr. Helms' characterization of fulfilling Warren

commission requests on a casabasis rather than uniformly

volunteering relevant information to the Warren Commission

stands in direct opposition to J. Lee. Rankin's

perception

of the CIA's investigative responsibility. Mr. Rankin was

asked by Committee Counsel whether he worked under the

impression that the Agency's responsibility was simply to

respond to questions that were addressed to CIA by the.

Warren Commission. In response, Mr. Rankin testified as

follows:

Not at all and if anybody had told me that I

would have insisted that the Commission com-

municate with the President and get a different

arrangement because we might not ask the right

(HSCA Class. Depo. of J. Lee Rankin,

were rarely specific. "The request was made initially

Mr. Helms, I take it from your

II. •

Agency Concern for the Sanctity

of Sensitive Sources and Methods - Factors Affecting

CIA Response to Warren Commission Requests

The length of time required by the CIA to

respond to the Warren Commission's requests for

information was dependent upon l) the availability

of information; : 2) the complexity of the issues

presented by the request and 3) the extent to which

the relevant information touched upon sensitive CIA

sources and

methods. On the first two points, Mr.

Helms testified that when CIA had been able to

satisfy a Commission request, the CIA would then send

a reply back:

"and some of these inquiries obviously

took longer than others.

For example, some might involve

000040

---

## Page 44

checking a file which was in Washington.

Other inquiries might involve trying to

see if we could locate somebody in some

overseas country:

Obviously, one takes longer to per-

form than the other.

(Exec. Sess. Test.

of Richard Helms, 8/9/78, p. 25)

•At times the CIA's concern for protecting its

sensitive sources and methods caused the Warren

Commission to experience greater difficulty in

getting relevant information than when the protec-

tion of such sources and methods was not at issue.

J. Lee Rankin expressed the opinion that the Agency's

sensitive sources

the Agency made the unilaterial decision to

limit access to CIA materials by the Commission.

BIA'S Initial Concera for Rerealing

sensitive Sources and Methods

The CIA's concern for revealing the existence

of sensitive technical operations, as outlined above,

was evident from the inception of the Warren Commission.

Mr. Scelso commented that "we were not authorized

at first to reveal all our technical operations."

V (Ibid., p. 158) But Scelso did testify that:

We were going to give them intelligence

reports which derived from all our sources,

including technical sources, including the

telephone intercept and the information

gotten from the interrogation of Silvia

Duran, for example, which corresponded

almost exactly

with the information from

the telephone intercepts. (Ib:.

The CIA policy limiting Warren Commission

lated as early as December 20, 1963, at which

time a cable was sent from CIA headquarters to

the Mexico City Station which stated:

He (Scelso) was quite sure it was not

The opinion expressed by Scelso as of December

20, 1963 was set forth on January 14, 1964 in a

formalized fashion. When Helms expressed his .

concern regarding exposure by the FBI of Agency

sources to the Warren Commission. Helms wrote

that the CIA had become aware that the FBI had

already:

called to the attention of the

Commission, through its attorney,

that we have information (as deter-

mined from Agency sources) coinciding

with the date when Oswald was in Mexico

City and which may have some bearing

on his activities while in that area.

(CIA dissemination to FBI, 1/14/64:

CIA # CSCI-3/779/510.

Mr. Helms further indicated that the CIA might

be called upon to provide additional information

acquired from checks of CIA records and agency

sources.

He suggested that certain policies be

moloved to enable CIA to work cooperatively

with the Commission in a manner which

would

protect CIA information, sources and methods.

Among the policies

articulated were two. which

Helms claimed would enable the Agency to control

- the flow of Agency originated information.

In

this

way the CIA could check the possibility of

revealing its sources and methods inadvertantly.

The policies articulated were:

The CIA policy of eliminating reference to Agency

sensitive sources and methods is further revealed

1964, sent from CIA Headquarters to the CIA Mexico

City Station. (CIA DOC. FOIA #398-204, 1/29/64,

DIR 97829) This cable indicated that knowledge of

Agency sources and techniques was still being with-

held from the Warren Commission, and stated that on

Saturday, February 1, 1964, the CIA was to present

a report on Oswald's Mexico City activities to the

Warren Commission which would be in a form

protective of the CIA's Mexico City Station's

sources and techniques (Ibid.)

"Spati and photo surveriance operations of Mexico Cite

Telephone Taps

Mr. Helms offered testimony regarding the CIA's

reticence to inform the Warren Commission, at least

during. the initial stage of the Commission's work,

of the CIA's

telephonic and photo surveillance

operations in Mexico City.

The reason for the sensitivity of these

telephone taps and surveillance was not

only becuase it was sensitive from the

Agency's standpoint, but the telephone

taps were running in

conjunction with

the Mexican authorities and therefore,

if this

between Mexico and the United States, :

and that was the reason.

(Exec. Sess.

Test. of Richard Helms, 8/9/78, pp. 51-52)

The CIA's unwillingness to inform the Warren

Commission in the early stages of its investigation

of the above-described surveillance operations is

a source of concern to this Committee. It is

indicative of an Agency policy designed to skew

in its favor the form 'änd substance of information

the CIA felt uncomfortable providing the Warren

Commission. (HSCA Class. Depo. of John Scelso,

5/6/78, p. 158) This process might well have

hampered the Commission's ability to proceed in

its investigation with all the facts before it.

As noted previously, on January 31, 1964,

the CIA provided the Warren Commission with a

memorandum that chronicled Lee Harvey Oswald's

Mexico City visit during September 26, 1963 -

actober 3, 19535 CLA DOC. TOIA #509-303 1/31/61)

That memorandum did not mention

that Oswald's various conversations with the. Cuban

and Soviet Embassy/Consulates had been tapped and

by the Agency's Mexico City" Station

subsequently transcribed?

Furthermore, that memo

randum dia not mention that the CIA had tapped

and transcribed conversations between Cuban Embassy

employee Sylvia Duran and Soviet officials at the

Soviet Embassy/Consulate nor was mention made of

the conversations between Cuban President Dorticos

and Cuban Ambassador to Mexico Armas which the CIA

had also tapped and transcribed.

On February 1, 1964, Helms appeared before the

A clarie:

Commission and likely discussed the memorandum of

January 31, 1964.

(CIA DOC. FOIA #498-204, 1/29/64,

DIR 97829) On February 10, 1964, J. Lee Rankin wrote

Helms in regard to the CIA memorandum of January 31.

(JFK DOC. No. 3872) A review of Rankin's letter

indicates that as of his writing, the Warren

Commission

had no substantive knowledge of the

telephonic surveillance operation or the production

i.e., the tapes and transcripts from that operation.

Rankin inquired in the February 10, 1964 letter

whether Oswald's direct communication with employees

of the Soviet Embassy (as stated in Paragraph 1

of January 31 memorandum) had been facilitated by

telephone or interview. Manifestly, had the Warren

Commission

been informed of the telephonic

surveillance operation and its success in tapping

Oswald this inquiry by Rankin would not have been

made.

Raymond Rocca's testimony tends to support

this conclusion. It was Rocca's recollection that

between the time period of January 1964 - April 1964,

Warren Commission's representatives had visited the

CIA's headguarters in Langley, Virginia and had

been shown

various transcripts resulting from the

CIA's telephonic surveillance operations in Mexico

City. (HSCA Class. Depo. of Raymond Rocca, 7/17/78,

p. 89) However, Mr. Rocca did not personally make

this material available to Commission representa-

tives and was not able to state under oath

precisely the point in time at which the warren

Commission first learned of these operations. (Ibid.)

On February 19, 1964 the CIA responded to

Rankin's inquiry of February 10. The Agency

response did indicate that Oswald had phoned the

Soviet Consulate and was also interviewed at the

Consulate. However, the Agency neither revealed

the source of this information in its response

to

the Commission nor indicated that this source

would be revealed by other means (e.g. by oral

/ briefing). (Ibid.)

Warren Commission Knowledge of CIA Telephonic Surveillance

During the period of March - April 1964,

David Slawson drafted a series of memoranda which

among other issues concerned Warren Commission know-

ledge of and access to the production material

derived from the CIA telephonic surveillance operations

in Mexico City. A review of these memoranda tends

to support the Committee's belief that the Warren

Conmission, through Mssrs. Slawson, Coleman, and

and Willens did not obtain access to CIA telephonic

surveillance materials until April 9, 1964. On

that date, Coleman, Slawson and Willens met with

Win Scott, the CIA's Chief of Station in Mexico

City, who provided them with various transcripts

and translations derived from CIA telephone taps

of the Cuban and Soviet Embassy/Consulates. (Slawson

Memorandum of April 22, 1964, Subject: Trip to

Mexico City p22.)

prior to. April 9, it appears doubtful that

the Commission had been given even partial access

to the referenced material. Nevertheless, by March

12, 1964, the record indicates that the Warren

Commission had at least become aware that the CIA

did maintain telephonic surveillance of the Cuban

Embassy/Consulate. (Slawson memorandum, March 12,

1964, Subj:

meeting with CIA representatives) .

Slawson's memorandum of March 12 reveals that the Warren

Commission had learned that the CIA possessed

tran-

scripts of conversations between the Cuban Ambassador

to Mexico, Armas, and the Cuban President Dorticos. The

Dorticos-Arnas conversations, requested by the Warren

Silvia Duran's arrest and interrogation by the

April 22, 1964, PP. 3, 19, 45-46) Helms responded

to the commission's request for access, stating

that he would attempt to arrange for the Warren

Commission's representatives to review this material.

(Slawson Memorandum of March 12, 1964, p. 6)

Another Slawson memorandum, dated March 25,

1964 concerned Oswald's trip to Mexico. In that memo

Slawson wrote that the tentative conclusions

he had reached concerning Oswald's Mexico trip,

were derived from CIA memoranda of January 31, 1964

and. February 19, 1964, (Slawson Memorandum of March

Slawson wrote:

These comments indicate that Slawson placed

qualified reliance upon the Mexican police summary.

Moreover, there is no indication that Slawson had

been provided the Duran telephonic intercept tran-

scripts. In fact, by virtue of Slawson's comments

concerning the Mexican police report, it would

appear that the Warren Commission, as of March 25,

had been provided little substantive information

pertaining to Silvia Duran. As Slawson reveals,

The Committee's belief that Slawson had

not been given access to the Duran transcripts

is

further supported by reference to his memorandum

of March 27, 1964 (CD 692) wherein he states his

conclusion that Oswald had visited the Cuban

Embassy on three occasions. (Ibid, p. 2) This

conclusion, he*

agarote, was based upon an analysis of

Silvia Duran's testimony before the Mexican police.

This memorandum bears no indication that he had

reviewed any of the Duran transcripts. Furthermore,

had Slawson been given access to these transcripts,

certainly their substance would have been incorporated

into his analysis and accordingly noted for this

purpose. His analysis would have reflected the fact

of his review either by its corroboration or

criticism of the above cited Mexican police summary report.

Logically, access to the CIA's telephonic

surveillance production would have clarified some

ambiguities. For example, on September 27, at 4:05 p.m.

Item number three of the above listing

On April 3, 1964, Coleman and Slawson expressed

their concern for receiving complete access to all

The most probable final result of the

wrote:

that we would not disclose beyond the

directly

following the assassination, indicating that his

staff immediately began to compile dossiers on

Oswald, Duran, and everyone else throughout Mexico

whom the CIA knew had had some contact with Oswald

(Ibid.) Scott revealed, that all known Cuban and Russian

intelligence agents

had quickly been put under

surveillance following the assassination. Slawson

concluded :

almost all the crucial-points.

We had

would be useless.

Therefore, instead, we

(Ibia, p.. 24)*

A separate Slawson memorandum of April 21, 1964 records

the results of the notetaking from original source

materials that he did following Scott's disclosures.

These notes dealt exclusively with the telephonic

On March 26, William Coleman wrote in a memorandum

for the record:

"The CIA directed a memorandum to J. Lee Rankin

Maria 27,

The following day, as agreed by Warren Commission

and Agency representatives, Samuel Stern of the

Commission visited CIA headquarters in Langley,

virginia. E Memorandrm of Samuel Stern, March 27,19647

Sterns' memorandum of his visit reveals that

ibid

he reviewed Oswald's file with Raymond Rocca."

Stern

indicated that Oswald's file contained those materials

furnished previously to the Warren Commission by

the CIA.

The file also contained:

"Cable reports of November 22 and November

23 from the CIA's Mexico City Station

relating to the photograph of the unidenti-

fied individual mistakenly believed to be

Lee Harvey Oswald and the reports on those

cables furnished on November 23,i 1963 to

reporting Oswald's contact with the Soviet Embassy

in Mexico City.

In addition, Stern examinea the

that

these messages

were

paraphrased accurately as set forth in the CIA's January

Mexico City trip. (,bil)

Lastly, Stern noted that Rocca provided him

for his review

a computer printout of the references

to Oswald-related documents located in the Agency's

electronic data storage system.

He stated "there is

no item listed on the printout which the warren Com-

Luisa Calderon

Approximately five hours after President

Kennedy's assassination a Cuban government employee

in Mexico City named "Luisa" received a telephone

call from an unidentified man speaking Spanish.

(CIA DOC. FOIA VEXT 7105, 11/27/63, 173-615, attachment)

This call had been intercepted and recorded by the

CIA's Mexico City Station as the result of its

LIENVOY (tel. tap) operation. (Ibid.) The Mexico

City Stationas subsequently reported to CIA

headquarters, identified

the Luisa of the conversa-

tion as Luisa Calderon, who was then employed in

the Commercial Attache's

office at the Cuban Consu-

late. (Ibia.)

During the course of the conversation, the

unidentified caller asked Luisa if she had heard

(of the assassination)

the latest news. Luisa replied in a

Joking tone:

"Yes, of course, I knew almost before Kennedy."

(Ibiad.)

it states that the caller told Luisa

held for the killing was a "gringo.

The unidenti-

fied caller replied, "yes." Luisa told her caller

that she had learned nothing else about the assassina-

tion and that she had learned about the assassination

only a little while ago.- The unidentified caller

commented:

We think that if it had been or had

then there was, let's say, the

possibility that a sort of civil

war would arise in the United States;

that contradictions would be sharpened...

possible Cuban conspiracy to assassinate President

This is the

(CIA DOC.,

Memorandum of Raymond Rocca for DC/OPS,

5/23/75, P. 15) * (seep. p.55a for F)

Standing by itself, Luisa Calderon's cryptic

comments do not merit serious attention. Her words

may indeed indicate foreknowledge of the assassina-

tion but may equally be interpreted without such a

sinister implication. Nevertheless, the Committee

has determined that. Luisa Calderon's case should

have merited

serious attention in the months following

the assassination.

In connection with the assassination, Luisa

Calderon's name first surfaced on November 27, 1963

in a cable sent by then Ambassador Mann to the State

Department (CIA DOC. DIR 85573, 11/27/63) .

In that cable Mann stated:

...Washington should urgently consider

feasibility of requesting Mexican authorities

to arrest for interrogation:

Eusebio Azcue,

Luisa Calderon and Alfredo Mirabal. The two

menáre Cuban national and Cuban consular

officers.

Luisa Calderon is a secretary

in Cuban

Consulate here."

*Regarding the issue of whether

Calderon's comments

could reasonably be interpreted to indicate possible

foreknowledge, the CIA position is as follows:

During the Rockefeller Commission inquiry,

Calderon's conversation was identified

as a possible item of information from

the Agency's Cuban and Soviet telephone

intercepts that might suggest foreknowledge.

of a plot to assassinate the American Presi-

dent. This involves a faulty translation of an

answer Calderon gave to her caller.

In answer

to the latter's question as to whether she

had heard the latest news, Calderon said:

"Si, claro, me entere casiantes que Kennedy."

The verb entere is mistranslated. Me entere

past tense) should be translated as "

the first person of the verb enterarset

found

out (or I learned) /about it -- the assassination?

almost before Kennedy /did/."

In other words,

Calderon was saying she heard about the shooting

of Kennedy almost at the time the event took

place..."

(CIA Doc., Memorandum Regarding

Luisa Calderon conversation, p.1).

The Committee fundamentally disputes the

narrow interpretation of Calderon's comments

assigned by the Agency. It is the Committee's

position that translation of Me Entere as

either "I found out" or "I learned about"

does not foreclose interpretation of Calderon's

comments as a suggestion on her part of possible

foreknowledge of President Kennedy's assassination.

as did other Cuban Embassy officers, the vital

link between her background and her comments

was never established for the Warren Commission

by the CIA. The Agency's oversight in this

regard may have forclosed the Commission fron

actively pursuing a lead of great significance.

Calderon's 201 file reveals that she

1963, carrying Cuban Passport E/63/7. Her date

At that

time,

Joseph Langosch,

Chief of Counterintelligence for the Special Affairs

the Cuban defector, AMMUG-1. The memorandum stated

that AMMUG-1 had no direct knowledge of Lee Harvey

items of interest based

upon the comments of certain

Cuban Intelligence Service officers. (Ibid.) Specificaliy,

• AMMUG-1 was asked if Oswald was known to the Cuban

intelligence services before November 23, 1963.

AMMUG-1 told Langosch "Prior to October 1963, Oswald

Langosch thereafter wrote that Calderon's

precise relationship to the DGI

was not clear.

As a comment to this statement he set forth the

CIA cable and dispatch traffic which recorded her

arrival in Mexico during January 1963 and departure

for Cuba within one month after the assassination.

(Ibia.)

On May 7, 1964, Langosch recorded additional

information he had elicited from AMMUG-1 regarding

Oswald's possible contact with the DGI. . (CIA DOC

On May 8 Langosch further disclosed AMMUG'S

knowledge of the Oswald case. (Ibid, attach. 5)

Langosch paraphrased

AMMUG's knowledge of Calderon

as follows:

I thought that Luisa Calderon might have

had contact with Oswald because I learned

about 17 March 1964, shortly before I made

a trip to Mexico, that she had been

involved with an American in Mexico.

The

information to which I refer was told to

me by a DGI case officer... I had commented

to (him) that it seemed strange that luisa

Calderon was receiving a salary from the .

DGI although she apparently did not do

any work for the Service.

(The case officer)

told me that hers was a peculiar case and

that he himself believed that she had been

recruited in Mexico by the Central Intelligence

Agency although Manuel Pineiro, the Head

of the DGI, did not agree.

As I recall,

(the case officer) had investigated Luisa

Calderon.

This was because, during the time

she was in Mexico, the DGI had intercepted

a letter to her by an American who signed

his name OWER (phonetic) or something

similar. As you know, the pronunciation

of Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in

Spanish so I am not sure of how the name

mentioned by Hernandez should be spelled.

It could have been "Howard" or something

different.

As I understand the matter.

the letter from the American was a love

letter but indicated that there was a

clandestine professional relationship

between the writer and Luisa Calderon.

I also understand from (the case officer)

that after the interception of the letter

she had been followed and seen in the

company of an American.

I do not know if

this could have been Oswald... (Ibid.)

AMMUG's information about the DGI, indicating its

sensitivity and operational significance.. (CIA DOC.

orally or in writing of the substance of the

above-referenced conversation of November 22,

1963?

If so, please indicate when and

in what form this information was provided,

and which CIA official provided it. (HSCA

request letter of August 28, 1978)

The CIA responded by memorandum:

"Although the (Mexico City) Station considered

the conversation of sufficient possible

interest to send a copy to headquarters,

the latter apparently did nothing with

it, for there appears to be no record in the

Oswald file of such action as may have

been taken.

A review of those Warren

Commission documents containing information

Secret or top

provided by the Agency and still bearing a

Secret or Top Secret classification does

not reveal whether the conversation was

given or shown to the Commission."

(CIA Doc., Memorandum Regarding Luisa

Calderon conversation, p. 1)

The available evidence thus supports the

conclusion that the Warren Commission was never

given the information nor the

opportunity by

which it could evaluate luisa Calderon's

significance to the events surrounding President

Kennedy's assassination. Had the Commission been

expeditiously provided this evidence of her

intelligence background, association with Silvia

consideration to her potential knowledge of Oswald

and the Cuban government's possible involvement in

a conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy.

Two difficult issues remain which are raised

by the Committee's finding.

First, why didn't

the Agency provide the Calderon conversation to the

Warren Commission;

secondly, why didn't the Agency

reveal to the Warren Commission its full knowledge

of Calderon's intelligence background, her possible

knowledge of Oswald and her possible connection to

the CIA or some other American intelligence apparatus.

The first question can be explained in benign

terms. It is reasonably possible that by sheer

oversight the conversation was filed away and not

recovered or recollected until after the Warren

Commission had completed its investigation and

Aésee p o5, arried portion as footnoteherein)

(See above CIA explanation)

published its repori.

As for the Agency's withholding of information

concerning Calderon's intelligence background, the

record reflects that the Commission was merely

informed that Calderon may have been a member of

the DGI. (CIA DoC. 5/5/64, Swenson Memorandum)

The memoranda which provided more extensive examina-

tion of her intelligence background were not made

available for the Commission's review. Significantly,

the May 8 memorandum written by Joseph Langosch

following his debriefing of AMMUG-1 indicated that

AMMUG-1 and a second Cuban Intelligence officer®

believed Calderon to be a CIA operative.

(CIA DOC.

FOIA 687-295, attach 5, 5/8/64) It is possible

that this information was not provided the Warren

Commission either because there was no basis in

fact for the allegation or because the allegation

was of substantive concern to the Agency. If the

allegation were true, the consequences for the CIA

would have

been serious. It would have demonstrated

possible

that a CIA operative, well placed in the Cuban Embassy,

may have possessed information prior to the assassina-

tion regarding Oswald

and/or his relationship to the

Cuban Intelligence Service. and that Services

However, there are indications that such contact

evidenced an interest in the activities of Calderon

and

her family. Whether this interest took

the form of a clandestine-agent relationship is

not revealed by Calderon's 201 file.

The Committee has queried David Ronis, the

author of the above cited dispatch requesting

that Calderon's sister be contacted by the CIA's

"domestic exploitation section." (HSCA Class.

Staff Interview of David Ronis, 8/31/78) Ronis

was a member of the CIA's Special Affairs Staff

at the time he wrote the dispatch. He worked

principally at CIA headquarters and was responsible

for recruitment and handling of agents for collection

of intelligence data. Mr. Ronis, when interviewed

by this Committee, stated that part of his responsi-

bility was to scour the Western Hemisphere division

for operational leads related to the work of the

Special Affairs

staff. Ronis recalled that he

normally would send requests to CIA field stations

for information or leads on various persons. Often

he would receive no response to these requests,

which normally indicated that no follow-up had

either been attempted or successfully conducted.

It was

Ronis' recollection that the above-cited

domestic exploitation section was a task force

within the Special Affairs Staff. He also stated

that in 1963 the CIA's Domestic Contacts Division

might have been requested to locate Luisa Calderon's

sister.

Ronis told the Committee that he had no

recollection of recruiting any person

associated

with the Cuban Intelligence Service. He did recall

that he had recruited women to perform tasks for

the Agency. However, he did not recall ever recruiting

any employees of the Cuban Embassy/Consulate in

Mexico City. Finally, Mr. Ronis stated that he had

no recollection that Luisa Calderon was associated

with the CIA. (Ibid.)

Various present and former CIA representatives

were queried whether Luisa Calderon had ever been

associated with the CIA. The uniform answer was

that no one

recalled such an association. (Cites:

Effective on May 1, A-l was under

(CIA Doc. Contract Approving Officer Memo, 6/6/64)

By June 23, 1964, Langosch was convinced that A-1

would be of great value to the Agency. He stated:

There is no question in my mind that

AMMUG-1 is a bona fide defector or

that he has furnished us with accurate

anã valuable information concerning

Cuban intelligence operations, staffers,

and agents.. (CIA Doc. Langosch Memo to

In Mexico City, he knows who the

Thus, A-1 was able to provide the CIA soon

after his defection with

accurate information

regarding DGI operations and DGI employees in

Mexico City. # Insert from p12

The Committee has reviewed the CIA's files

concerning A-l. This examination was undertaken

to determine: 1) whether A-l had provided any

valuable investigative leads to the CIA pertaining

to the assassination of President Kennedy; and 2)

whether, if such leads were provided, these leads

and/or other significant information were made

available to the Warren Commission.

The Committee's initial review of the

materials provided by the CIA to the Warren

Commission did not disclose the existence of the

AMMUG files. However, the Committee did during

the course of its review examine a file containing

material passed to the Rockefeller Commission. That

file made reference to A-l. Included in this

file was a memorandum of May 5, 1964 written by

Joseph Langosch which concerned information A-1

provided

about the Oswald

case. (CIA Doc. FOIA 68-290

Langosch

this file were the A-l debriefing memoranda of

May 7, and May 8, 1964 previously cited with regard

to Luisa Calderon. (CIA Doc. FOIA #687-295, attach's

From review of these materials the Committee

Prior to learning of Oswald's probable contact

with DGI Officers, James Angleton, Chief of the

CIA's Counter Intelligence Staff passed an

internal

memorandum to Raymond Rocca, also of the Counter-

intelligence Staff, which stated that he had been

informed by the DDP, Richard Helms, that J. Lee

Rankin had contacted John McCone to request that

the Director consent to an interview before the

Warren Commission on May 14, 1964, (J. Edgar

Undoubtedly the White House source referred

to in Angleton's memo was A-1. This conclusion is

based in part upon the date of this memo which

was quite close in time to A-l's defection. In

addition, Rocca's staff prepared

prior

to DCI McCone's

appearance before the Warren

a "Brief

outlining various positions adopted by. the CIA vis a

vis its investigative efforts and assistance to the

On May 15, 1964, the day of McConé's interview,

the Warren Commission received its first formal

communication regarding A-1. (CIA DOC FOIA 697-294,

identify A-1 by his real name or cryptonym nor did

the Agency indicate that the source of this information

Attached to the May 15 communication was a

*The CIA memorandum states in part as follows:

When CI Staff learned of AMMUG-1's defection

and considered the possibility that he

might have some knowledge of the Oswald

case, CI Staff submitted a list of questions

was handled as a sensitive

matter, it was dictated directly to a CI

(Counterintelligence) stenographer on

5 May 1964.

Note:

A-1 was debriefed on

several subjects on 4 May 64.

The procedure

was to assign each subject discussed a

debriefing number and they were written

up in contact report form by the WH case

officer.

The instructions from CI staff

were to handle the Oswald case debriefing

very closely and not to

keep any copies in

WH Division/.

The "Oswald Case" was

logged in the WH notebook log as debriefing

report number 40, but the report itself

was dictated by the WH Case Officer directly

to a CI staff stenographer.

There would

be no reason

to include the number 40 on

the report of this special debriefing for

CI staff, since it was their only debriefing

report.

We are certain it is the debriefing

report

(#40) because the date is the

same;

it is the only debriefing report on Oswald

listed in AMMUG-1 records; and it it (sic)

the only AMMUG-1 debriefing report in

Oswald's 201 file.

due consideration to the CIA's serious concern

for protecting its sources, the fact that A-l's

status was not disclosed prevented the Warren

Commission from exercising a possible option,

i.e. to take the sworn testimony of A-1 as it

concerned Oswald and the Kennedy assassination.

show, the Agency unilaterally rejected the possibility

of exercising this option.

well have been considered by the Warren Commission.

Agency project referred to as the AMLASH

operation (CIA Inspector General Report 1967

pp. 1-74, 78-112). The AMLASH operation involved

a high level Cuban official (assigned the CIA

cryptonym AMLASH/1) who, during 1962 while meeting

with a CIA representative expressed the desire

• to

assassinate Fidel Castro (Ibid., p. 84). As a

result of AMLASH's expressed objective and the

CIA'S

desire to find a viable political alternative

to the Castro regime, the Agency subsequently

provided AMLASH with both moral and material

support designed to depose Fidel Castro. (Ibid.,

pp. 80-94).. The AMLASH operation was terminated

by the CIA in 1965 as the result of security leaks.

(Ibid. pp. 104-106) During 1965; AMLASH and his

conspirators were brought to trial in Cuba for plotting

against Castro.

AMLASH was sentenced to death, but

at Castro's request the sentence was reduced to

twenty-five years imprisonment. (Ibid. pp. 107-110) .

In its examination of the AMLASH operation

the 1967 IGR concluded that the CIA had offered both

direct and indirect support for AMLASH's plotting (Ibid. p. 80)

The most striking example of the CIA's direct

1967 IGR states

"it is likely that at the very

moment

President Kennedy was shot a CIA officer

was meeting with a Cuban agent in Paris and giving

him an

assassination device for use against CASTRO."

(Ibid.)

The 1967 IGR offered no firm evidence confirming

or refuting Castro's knowledge of the AMLASH operation

prior to the assassination of President Kennedy. The

1967 IGR did note that in 1965 when AMLASH was

clearly be traced to the CIA; and

unlike the earlier plots, the CIA had

assassination, despite Castro's threat

to retaliate for such plotting. No one

directly involved in either investigation

the AMLASH operation. No one investi-

gated a connection between the AMLASH

operation

and President Kennedy's

assassination. Although Oswald had been

in contact with pro-Castro and anti-

Castro groups for many months before the

assassination, the CIA did not conduct

a thorough investigation of questions

of Cuban government or Cuban exile

In 1977, the CIA issued a second Inspector

General's Report concerning the subject of CIA

sponsored assassination plots. This Report, in

large part, was intended as a rebuttal of the

Church Committee's findings. The 1977 IGR states:

The Report (of the Church Committee)

characteristics

that it did not have

during the period preceding the assassina-

tion of JEk in order to support the SSC

view that it should have been reported

to the Warren Commission. (1977 IGR P. 2)

The 1977 IGR concluded that prior to the

assassination of President Kennedy, the AMLASH

operation was not an assassination plot.

Nevertheless, the 1977 IGR did state:

It would have served to reinforce the

credibility of (the Warren Commission)

its efforts had it taken a broader view

of the matter (of normal avenue of

investigation).

The CIA, too, could.

have considered in specific terms

what most then saw in general terms--

the possibility of soviet or Cuban

involvement in the

assassination

to erroneous criticisms made today.

The Agency should have taken broader

initiatives then as well.

That

CIA employees at the time felt-as

they obviously did--that the activities

about which they knew had no relevance

to the Warren Commission inquiry does

not take the place of a record of

conscious review. (1b1d. p. 11)

Richard Helms, as the highest level CIA

employee in contact with the Warren Commission on

a regular basis, testified to the Rockefeller

Commission that he did not believe the AMLASH

operation was relevant to the investigation of

President Kennedy's death. (Rockefeller Commission,

*In response to Langosch's sworn statements, this

Committee has received from the CIA an affidavit

executed by Kent L. Pollock (CIA pseudonym) who "served

as Executive Officer for Desmond FitzGerald during the

entire period in which he was Chief of the Special Affairs

Staff...and discussed with him the AMLASH operation as it

progressed." (CIA Doc., Affidávit of Kent I. Pollock,'

executed Oct. 5, 1978, p. l)V Mr. Pollock specifically

contested Langosch's assertion that the AMLASH operation

was characterized by the Special Affairs Staff, Desmond

FitzGerald, and other senior level CIA officials as an

assassination operation.

In pertinent part, Pollock

drew the following conclusions:

To the best of my knowledge, Mr. FitzGerald

considered the AMLASH operation

to be a political

action activity with the objective of organizing

a group within Cuba to overthrow Castro and the

Castro regime by means of a coup d'etat.

I heard

Mr. FitzGerald discuss the AMLASH operation

frequently, and never heard him characterize it as

an "assassiantion operation."

Mr. FitzGerald

stated within my hearing on several occasions

his awareness that coup d'etat often involves

loss of life. (Ibid., par. 3, p. 2)

He also stated:

Desmond FitzGerald did not characterize the AMLASH

operation as an

"assassigntion operation"; the

case officer did not; I, as Executive Officer, never

discussed any aspect of the AMLASH operation with

Joseph H. Langosch; the Deputy Chief, the other

branch chiefs and

the special assistants could not

have so characterized it since they did not know

about the pen (the pen was specially fitted with a

hypodermic. syringe in response to urgings by AMLASt

for a means to start the coup by killing Castro.)

The case officer offered the pen to AMLASH on the day

of President Kennedy's death. AMLASH rejected the

pen with disdain. /Ibid., par. 4, p. 2/), (Ibid.,

not simply whether the AMLASH operation was an

assassination plot prior to President Kennedy's

death. The broader and more significant issue,

as the 1977 IGR has identified it, is whether

the AMLASH operation was of sufficient relevancy

to have been reported to the Warren Commission.

In the case of the AMLASH operation this

determination is a most difficult matter to

resolve.

Reasonable men may differ in their

characterization of the Agency's operational

objectives.

Based upon the presently available evidence

it is the Committee's position that such informa-

tion, if made available to the Warren Commission,

might have stimulated the Commission's investiga-

tive corcern for possible Cuban involvement or

complicity in the assassination. As J. Lee Rankin

commented before this Committee:

...when I read... the Church Committee's

report--it was

an ideal situation for

them to just pick out any way they

wanted to tell the story and fit it

in with the facts that had to be met

and then either blame the rest of it

on somebody else or not tell any more

or polish it off. I don't think that

could have happened back in 1964.

I think there would have been a

much better chance of getting to

the heart of it.

It might have

only revealed that we are involved

in it and who approved it and all

that. But I think that would

have at least come out. (HSCA Class.

Depo. of J. Lee Rankin, 8/17/78, p.91)

The Committee is in agreement with Mr. Rankin

that had the AMLASH operation been disclosed to

the Warren Commission, the Commission might have

been able to foreclose the speculation and conjecture

that has surrounded the AMlASH operation during

the past decade. As history now records, the AMLASH

operation remains a footnote to the turbulent

relations between Castro's Cuba and the United States.
