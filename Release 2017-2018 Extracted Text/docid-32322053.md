Title: John F. Kennedy Records Collection

Act of

1992 (the Act)

have been placed on record since the previous search, and to

search their offices,

storage areas, or archived files for any

documents or information related to President John F. Kennedy's

assassination.

Darlas, Chicago, New Orleans and Miami are

requested to include RAs in their search for records.

Details:

In 1992, Congress signed the Act mandating federal

agencies to release all documents concerning the presidential

assassination or information related by conspiracy theory to the

assassination.

The Act narrowly defined the types of information

that agencies

could still protect by postponement until the year

2017. The Act also established the Assassination Records Review

Board (the Board) as a separate entity to oversee the release of

material from

the federal agencies to the National Archives and

Records Administration (NARA).

Beyond the Board's oversight

responsibilities, the Act charged the Board with the duties of

reviewing agencies' proposed postponements with their evidence

for approval or denial and researching additional areas of

information for new material related to the assassination.

FBI has been working with the Board since its inception to meet

the requirements of the Act.

On November 29, 1996, the Board wrote a letter to the

FBI setting forth a formal compliance program.

The letter

requested the FBI's cooperation with the Board "in discharging

its responsibility of assuring Congress and the American people

that the goals of the JFK Act will be accomplished to the

greatest reasonable extent."

The compliance program is the

Board's answer to demonstrating "to the American public that a

thorough, good-faith, and diligent effort have been made to

locate and release all remaining assassination-related, records xeD

States Government sland that-the-
