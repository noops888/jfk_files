The point of the

eferenced memorandum is that

consideration should be given now to "whether or not the

entire matter can be fully disclosed at this time."

This

submission is designed to make it possible for you, the

IG and others whom you may desire to consult to make this

decision.

The narrative-interpretive summary has been

put together in such a way that it discloses no cyptonyms,

pseudonyms or other CIA jargon.

However, its contents go

well beyond what has been released to the public thus far

the Warren Commission documentation.

This point must

be borne in mind

in making a decision on Mr.

Belin's

question.

seems to me necessary, in reply to Mr. Belin, that he or

his representative review the documentation that backs up

the narrative.

The documentation has not been keyed into

the narrative presentation, but it follows the chronologi-

cal order of presentation

developments in the matter,

and there is an overall index

to facilitate reference to individual items.

It seems to me that whoever makes a decision on

3. Under the extraordinary py

effort to develop information

on the assassin

and the

assassination, copies of the photograph were

made available by CIA's Mexico Station Chief on the afternoon of

22 November to the local FBI representative, and later that day,

assertedly on the decision of the Ambassador, copies were conveyed by

an FBI representative by a special flight carried out by the U.S. Naval

Attaché to the Dallas office of the FBI for possible use in the ongoing

investigation. One photograph, cropped by the FBI, was shown to

Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD (Lee Harvey OSWALD's mother) in Dallas on the

evening of 23 November 1963 by FBI Agent Bardwell D. ODUM.

4. The Warren Commission's report describes the sequence of events

at pp. 364-365 and 667 (Attachment B) which ultimately resulted in

Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD's allegation that

Lee Harvey OSWALD - Reporting on Mexico City Stay

6. Although in no way related to Lee Harvey OSWALD or his stay. in

Mexico City from the morning of 27 September 1963 to the morning of

2 October 1963, at least one set of photographs of the unidentified man

originated during OSWALD's stay there. It is important, therefore, to

an understanding of the acquisition and handling of the photographs by

the Mexico Station to review what the Station ascertained and did with

the information it developed about OSWALD

Overall, CIA's information can account solely for very brief periods

during 27, 28 September and 1 October. All coverage by CIA during the

entire period was technical. The Station had no live source (living

agent) coverage

It is, therefore, firm

that there was no CIA photo coverage of OSWALD at any time during his

Mexico trip or stay in Mexico City. Moreover, although it had made a

cabled request on 15 October, the Mexico Station had no photo of OSWALD

in its records, nor did it receive one from Headquarters--which did not

have one either--before 22 November 1963.

"triggers" that normally operates to focus and

accelerate more speedy

review and reporting of this kind of raw intelligence is the mention of

a name. This was precisely what occurred in the second of two conversa-

tions on l October with the Soviet Embassy, during which the speaker said

he was "Lee OSWALD." It was this information reported by the Station to

Headquarters in its first indication on OSWALD on 8 October 1963.

15. The totality of Mexico Station coverage on, or reasonably

inferable to be OSWALD, consisted of five (5) voice intercepts as follows:

OSWALD made at least two calls,

at 1031 and 1045 hours,

to the

Soviet Embassy. He identified himself

twice during the second call when he talked with OBYEDKOV--a guard--

and referred to his talk on Saturday, probably with KOSTIKOV. There

no photographic coverage of OSWALD on 1 October; if the follow-

ing reasoning is correct, that was as it should be. From the context

of the two calls, there would have been no reason for him to go to

the Embassy. His case had clearly been placed at the sufferance of

the USSR Embassy in Washington. His two calls on l October were

concerned with whether any reply had been received from Washington.

Under those circumstances, it is unreasonable to believe OSWALD

would have gone to the Soviet Embassy

Neither of these errors are significant (though they persist in the

c. Paragraph (2) of the Mexico Station's report, which dealt with

a concurrent, but separate, phenomenon, the description of an individual

observed going into and out of the Soviet Embassy, had been locked on to

Lee OSWALD as an alleged descriptive fact. The Station's qualification,

"appeared to be an American," was transformed in the flat designation of

the unidentified individual as "The American."

It is clear that Mexico Station had forgotten that according

to its own communication the unidentified male in the photo was of

by Headquarters on 10 October precluded the identity with OSWALD of the

(see Hearings,

Vol. XVI, p. 638).

45. The net effect of the gevelopments in the hearings of the

Commission was to require the admission of the cropped photograph into

evidence in a chain of depositions beginning with ODUM, including the

FBI Inspector, James R. MALLEY (who had trimmed the photograph used by

the Commission in Washington), and Richard HELMS, who deposed for the

originator. These documents speak for themselves and will be found in

the Hearings, Vol. XI, pp. 468-470.

46. Mexico Station and other senior Agency officers strongly

advised against the publication of the

grounds that the Soviets would be

of a useful and continuing U.S

48. In this instance the needs of the Commission prevailed over

the DCI's statutory obligation to protect sources and methods. The

"Unidentified Individual" remains to this day unidentified and there is

no credible evidence up to this time to rebut the assertion made by

Mr. HELMS in the concluding sentence of his memorandum to Mr. RANKIN on

23 June 1964. And the operation did, as predicted, go down the drain.

a result of this search, I can state categorically

that the files of this Agency do not contain, and

Two other photographs of

It is a matter of more than ordinary interest to note that

on this occasion Mr. FENSTERWALD, who was accompanied by his

partner, Mr. William OHLHAUSEN, told Mr. HOUSTON and another

representative of the Agency in attendance that he knew who the

unidentified man was. The following is extracted from Mr. HOUSTON's

Memorandum of Record, 8 April 1971:

"3. Mr. FENSTERWALD came to my office this

The following is extracted from the Memorandum of Record

by the other CIA man present, Mr. Arthur E. DOOLEY.

"Mr. FENSTERWALD said he knew who the person
