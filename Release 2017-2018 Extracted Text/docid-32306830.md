COSA NOSTRA

AR - CONSPIRACY

ReBuairtel to Chicago dated 12/20/68 and

Chicago letter to Bureau dated 12/31/68.

CG 6538-C-TE advised this date that DOMINIC

NUCCIO is in Miami, Florida, and has been there since

12/30/68.

NUCCIO is a long-time LCN member in Chicago

and although not believed to be of sufficient stature

to attend an LCN meeting is nonetheless in the Miami

area and may possibly be considered as a potential

attendant.
