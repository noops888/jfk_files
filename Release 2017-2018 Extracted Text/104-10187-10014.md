SUBJECT

: Project KDFACTOR - Amendment

Termination Request.

1.

The KDFACTOR Project (until 1970 encryptec

as the

LIENTY Project) was initially approved ir

1958 to provide financial and material support for

visual and photographic

surveillance operations

targetted against the Soviet Embassy in Mexico

City.

In June

1972 the project supported

five

agents and tho basehouse surveillance sites.

ADDe ln the amount of sio coo vos catere and the

to the KDFACTOR Project in the amount of $9,844

for FY - 73 to provide for costs of agent

terminations.

The decision to terminate all agents and

facilities under the KDFACTOR Project was based

on a security review of the project activities

which indicated that the VWBLANKET principal knew

the basic details

of the NDFACTOR operations,

including the target, the location of the surveillance

sites, and probably the true names and former

cryptonyms of the agents covered by the project.

The cost of terminating the agents under the

KDrACTOR Project amounted to $15,573; the cost of

losing down, the two basehouses under the projec

was $1,412.

The long tenure of three of the terminated

agents, the relatively high monthly salary of

KDFACTOR-2 ($440) plus the computation of the

termination payments in accordance with Mexican

Ist and custom were the primary reasons that the

final agent termination costs amounted to $15,573.

All agent terminations were accomplished

in an amicable manner.

No visible security risks

were apparent at the tine of the terminations

although any one, or all,

of the terminated agents

may at some future date decide to divulge to an

interested party

the details of the KDFACTOR Project

operations.

KDFACTOR-2, KDFACTOR-5, and KDFACTOR-6

the Station since 1956 and, therefore, obviously

of exposure of the KDFACTOR Project operations by a

$19,000

in 1973 for $20,000

This project covers

The films are developed and printed

inside the Station.

2. The production from this operation has consis

tently been rated high by the Bureau (which is the prin

cipal customer in the field), by other Government agencies

and by SB Division.

Photosurveillance of a Soviet Embassy

might not be a high priority target in

some countries.

But the fact that the Soviet Embassy in Mexico is a large

and active one

and the fact that its primary target is

important and valuable.

do so and that the work was probably done by

his uncleared secretary.

Family relationships keep

All

of this is in the files but not in any one place. We

---

## Page 27

believe it is time for the Station to make an updated

security review of the operation with particular attention

to the knowledgeability of terminated agents and their

families:

We also believe that the Station should now

address itself to the contingency that the present sites

or personnel will be blown and to investigate alternative

means of continuing their valuable coverage.

The ADDP last approved this project in May 1970

with the condition that termination payments to the

principal agent and his divorced wife be made on a

monthly basis. This condition has been met.

5. The budgets requested for the beit two years are

simple and straightforward.

Salaries and the traditional

bonuses for the five paid agents cone to about $13,000.

Rent and utilities on the two observation posts come to

$5,600.

The small balance is for operational expenses.

This project action also requests amendment of the FY

1971 budget by $1,260 to cover that part of the cost of

termination bonuses to the principal agent and his di

vorced wife

not be absorbed by the project.

The total of the termination bonuses was $12,500.

6. This is a valuable and productive project which

helps fulfill a Priority A-1 Station requirement.

FI Staff recommends approval.

terminated in 1970,

but the termination payments were made

during FY 1971 causing an increase in that years obligations.

In addition, certain DYers

have been linked up with their escort officers and clues

to personal relationships have occasionally been exploited.

In the fiold of Soviet patterns of activity and

associations, LIEMPTY has been

able to report accurate

changes in cortain specific cases.

that NIKITIN, montioned in paragraph 3 above, changed his

This kind of information is a basic

contribution

to the Station'g

continuing efforts

identify

and assess certain Soviets for possible

recruitment or defection,

At Headquarters,

the Soviet Bloc Division uses

LIEMPTY photographs, particularly photographs of Soviet

Embassy officials,

for identification purposes in con-

nection with defector cases.

The LIEMPTY material also

keeps the Station's Soviet section up-to-date on which

Soviet officers have been in the Embassy, which ones have

been away; who has used which car; who has been in contact

whom; and other similar information useful in the

conduct of Soviet operations.

Problems:

A security problem has developed involving

Raymond H. GERENDE.

According to GERENDE, his wife wants

a divorce, apparently based mainly on incompatability of

personalities.

The problem basically is that both want

of the children and this has sparked a dispute

that has become more bitter and violent daily.

In addition,

the monetary settlement is in dispute.

The problem is

compounded by the fact that GERENDE's wife knows in some

considerable detail of GERENDE's activities on behaif of

the

Agency.

Thus, if the case does go to court, it could

lead to the surfacing of GERENDE's Agency employment and

possible compromise of LILYRIC, LICALLA and LIENTRAP.

Even if the case does not go to court, GERENDE's wife could

expose him as an Agency employee.

Since late 1969, Mexico

City

Station has been in touch with both GERENDE and his

wife on this problem,

and every effort is being made by

the Station to have both parties settle the divorce out of

court,

and to protect GERENDE's cover and that of the

project.

After weighing all factors, it has been decided

that continued employment of GERENDE is not an acceptable

I'isk,

and the

decision has been reached to terminate him

by the end of FY 1970.

GERENDE will be paid a termination

bonus of $10,000 for 15 years service, about $1, 250 more

Renewal of Project LIEMPTY

WH Division requests renewal of Mexico City Station's

Operational Support Project, LIEUPTY, for $23,635 for Fiscal

Year 1971 and a $10,498 amendment for FY 1970'

to cover termin-

atton payments to a 'former Principal Agent and his wife.

One agont termination

and the transter of the cost of a mobile surveillance unit to

another projoct are responsible for the reduced FY 1971 request.

LIEMPTY supports a visual and photographic surveil

lance

of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City.

It Includes a

Principal Agent, Raymond H. GERENDE (P), and 6 subagents who

maintain two separate safehouses, one in front and one in

the rear of the Soviet Embassy,

from which anyone entering or

leaving the Embassy can be observed and photographed.

also handles SB operations) arose during the project year.

GERENDE

has been having marital difficulties which may end

in divorce.

Along with other incompatible features of the

marrlage, which have resulted in numerous fanily fights,

there have been long, bitter and violent arguments as to who

will have custody .of their & children and concerning a mone

tary settlement;: The Station has become involved in these

altercations because GERENDE's wife 1s Inowledgeable of his

CIA relatfonship

and could, if she chose to do so, expose him

as an agency employee. She has promised to keep quiet but

there is no assurance that she will do so.

In vier of the

risk involved, should GERENDE's wife expose his agency rela

tonship and in view of the fact that, despite his 15 year

of service and his undisputed ability and expertence, other

unfavorable qualities militate against his retention,

the

Station is considering terminating GERENDE.

It is proposed

to pay him a termination bonus of $10,000 for 15 years of

service in accordance with Mexican law and his wife $2,500 as

a security measure designed to keep her quiet.

After discus

sion with the dess, FI Staff belleves that,

1f GERENDE 18

paid the $10,000 termination money, it should not be given to

him in one lump sum but should

be pald on a monthly basis,

the amount per month to be determined by the Station, thus

eliminating

the possibility of his squandering it all at

once and possibly coming back for more of the same.

The sane

procedure should be followed in the $2,500 payment to his

wife.

In both cases at least an element of

control 1s

assured in that both GERENDE and his wife will know that con-

tinued receipt of their monthly payments will depend upon

their continued loyalty to the agency.

In the meantime, we

leel this man, whose morale, and ability have been

seriously

affected by his marital strife, given time,

can perhaps be

rehabilitated and

once again become a valuable Station asset.

This would ensure his continued loyalty and give him an income

out of which to pay his alimony. Aside from the foregoing

there were no other problems,

security or otherwise.

Alt

meetings between the case officer and the new Principal Agent

are held under secure conditions, or more often if necessary,

at prearranged dates, times and places.

Meetings between the

P/A and the subagents are held under similar conditions. The

Station

has been requested to submit an updated emergency re-

contact plan to be included in the first FY 1971 quarcerly

program report for this project.

:. MPS/BG

SUBJECT

: FY 1970 Renewal of Project LEMPTY for $38,970

Project LEMPTY, now in its eleventh year, is the Mexican

Station's operation which provides visual and photographic surveil

lance of the Soviet Embassy from safehouses at the front entrance

and back of the building,

as well as from a mobile unit.

A11 Soviet

personnel and their visitors coming to the Embassy are photographed.

From 1 November 1967 to 31 Decenber 1968, approximately 21,367 photo-

graphs were taken and thousands of pages of surveillance reports were

completed by personnel in this project.

SB Division is pleased with

the quantity and quality of the photographs and the Station finds them

useful for operational purposes against the SB target.

During the

past year several U.S. citizens entered the Soviet installation in

Mexico City and their photograchs were identified by the FBI. There

is a good relationship between the Station and the FBI in Mexico City

and appropriately sterilized photographs are passed locally.

2. There have been no significant security problems.

The only changes in the project have been the elimination of

one of the sarehouses, which was used as an observation post

termination of the agent who attended it.

No real loss resulted from

this change since the safehouse was so located that photographs taken

from it overlapped those taken from another safehouse.

The agent who

ser terminated amicablyas also during the past year a new agent was

added to the project.

4. Total funds requested for FY 1970 are $38,970. Salaries and

legally required bonuses

for nine agents come to $30,080; safehouse

cental and maintenance amounts to $6,188; maintenance of two vehicles,

$1,200; and photo and operational expenses, $1,5c0.

FY 1969 approval

was for $43,520 and estimated obligations for this period are $43,500.

A rew, $5,000 vehicle was purchased in FY 1969 and none is needed in

FY 1970 which accounts for the reduction in costs for the present year.

2.

LIEMPTY is a project supporting Soviet operations

of the

Mexico City Station.

It provides for two baschouses,

a photo surveillance vehicle, and personnel for photographic

and visual surveillance of the Soviet Embassy. Presently,

two fixed surveillance points near the Embassy provide the

location from which the photographs are taken and observers

are stationed.

One basehouse

is adjacent to the rear of the

play and work.

Embassy, whore Soviet officials meet from the front of the

other basehouse is across the street

Embassy and gives a direct view of every person entering or

leaving.

There is also a mobile photographic unit (a VW

van) which is now used in support of all Mexico City Station

operations and in conjunction with the LIEMBRACE surveillance

team (used primarily against Soviet targets). Raymond Ho

GERENDE, an

indigenous contract agent,

is the principal agent

of the operation and meets daily with the basehouse keepers

and subagents.

LIEMPTY contributes significantly to the Station's

Soviet operations program and is considered an essential

element of the Station's support apparatus.

During the

period l November 1967 through 31 December 1968, approxi-

mately 21,367 photographs were taken.

them to avoid being photographed, even when having meetings

PROJECT BRIEFING

PROJECT : LISMPTY

Wil - Mexico

ACTION

: ADD/P approval of renewal (29 mоs.)

1 Dec 67 - 30 Jun 69°

PURPOSE: An operational support project providing three basehouses and

a mobile surveillance unit to monitor primarily the Soviet

Embassy, its personnel and its visitors, by physical and photo-

graphic surveillance.

BACKGROUND: The project covers three properties near the Soviet Embassy

(two in front of the Embassy's sole entrance and one bohind the

garden) from which visual and photographic surveillance is carried

It also covers a darkroom and a mobile photographic truck:

Some of the project personnel are used at times for miscollaneous

support tasks such as servicing poctal boxes and for counter

surveillance and other protective services.

PROGRESS:

During the past year the project provided nearly all of the opera

photographs and physical surveillance reports used in the

Station's operations against the Soviet Enbassy and its personnel.

SB Division says,

"This rather unique operation has unquestionubly

made a major contribution to the increasingly effective Soviet

Operations proyran of the Mexico Station."

FUNDS

The project produces primarily operational data and counterintell

It provides leads, evidence of which soviet

officers have been in the Embassy and which ones have been away,

who has used which car, who has been talking to whom or going out

of the building with whom.

(One photograph from this project was o

used in the Warren Commission Report.)

Project LIEMPTY

1.

WH Division requests renewal of LIENPTY for the

19-month period l December 1967 through 30 June 1969 in

the amount

of $69,725:

While this represents a slight

reduction on a pro rata basis from the $45,000 for which

LIEMPTY was approved for the 12-month period starting

1 Decomber 1966,

it reflects a proportionately modest

increase in cost for the 19-month renewal period over the

estimated

total disbursement of $40,130 for the past

project year.

This will provide for small salary

increases

to meet the rising cost of living for certain of the agents

involved in the project who have not received raises in

some time as well as for slightly higher rental fees for

the various basehouses.

The project, now in its tenth

year, is designed primarily to provide for the collection

of operational information on the Soviet Embassy in Mexico

City,

including the identification and muvenchts of its

personnel

and visitors.

To this end, LIENPTY provides

for the maintenance and exploitation

of three basehouses

for fixed visual and

photographic

surveillance of the

Soviet Embassy and a mobile basehouse in the form of &

Embassy, leaders and mecting sites

PROJECT BRIEFING

PROJECT: LIEMPTY

WH - Mexico City

ACTION : ADD/P approval of renewal

1 Dec 66 - 30 Nov 67

PURPOSE: Provides stationary surveillance against the Soviet Embassy

and a mobile photographic baschouse which is used primarily

against the Polish Embassy and local Communist party leaders.

• PROGRESS: Three basehouses (LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA) pro-

vide coverage of both the front and rear of the Soviet Embassy.

Throughout the past renewal period each operational component

contributed actively and concretely to the fulfillment of the

opcrational tasks levied on the Station. In the first nine-month

period approximately 17,000 individual frames of operational

photographs were provided from the fixed basehouses. These

served to confirm the identities of Embassy personnel and

their visitors and provided detailed reporting on the movement

and habit patterns of selected targets of special interest. The

mobile unit (LIENTRAP) provided over 1, 000 individual photo-

graphs. Of particular value were photographs of local and

exile Communist leaders. Raymond H. GERENDE (p) continued

in the role as principal agent for Project LIEMPTY. His overall

operational assignment involved at least 12 clandestine meetings

per week, in addition to his meetings with the LIEMPTY project

case officer.

PROBLEMS: In mid 1966 LICOWL/l, who owns a small store near the

Soviet Embassy, reported that a Soviet official had approached

him and asked him to inform on his neighbors.

Reportedly the

Soviet named LIEMPTY/6 of the LIMITED basehouse by name

and also asked about the tenants of the building housing LILYRIC.

However, in view of LICOW L's previous history of lying, it is

difficult to assess exactly what the Soviets requested and just

what LICOWL/ 1 may have told them. The Station is still looking

into this development.

CI STAFF: Strongly urges the Station to continue its close

monitoring of Soviet interest in the installation buildings and

attenpis to obtain information on sensitive project personali-

ties. The Station should devise necessary contingency plans

of action to eliminate any security hazards if it is determined

that the Soviets are intensifying such efforts and could be

getting "too close" to the project installations, personalities

and activities.

SUBJECT

: LIEUPTY Project Renewal

It is requested that the LIEIPTY Project be

renewed for the period l December 1966 through 3(

November 1967 for a total of $45,000: $29,020 for

FY 1967 and $15,980 for FY 1968.

2.

LIEMPTY covers stationary surveillance base-

houses

targeted against the Soviet Embassy.

These

basehouses provide photographic coverage and logs.

Two

of the baselouses (LIMITED and LILYRIC) cover the

activity in the front of the Embassy, and LICALLA provides

coverage of the back courtyard area.

also covers a mobile photographic baschouse in the form

of a panel truck which is used against the Polish Embassy

where we have no permanent surveillance basehouse, and

against other targets of opportunity.

3. The value of Soviet Embassy photographic cover

age during the past year

was proven when the loys

maintained by LILYRIC were used to double check on an

operation involving LIRUSTIC-I and LICOWL-l who had told

conflicting stories of certain events concerning the

activity of some Soviets.

Through the surveillance

reports of the LIEMPTY Project against the Soviet Embassy,

it was proven without a doubt that LICOWL-1 (who had Just

taken a polygraph without apparent deception) was lying

about his contacts with the Soviets.

The LIENTRAP mobile photographic basehouse was

targeted against leaders and meeting sites of the local

Communist parties as well as other targets of opportunity,

off the Station's surveillance team when it

•is used against Soviet targets, Headquarters has

already assumed that the Soviets have identified this

baschouse.)

LICONLl also listed several persons

named by

the Soviet who had no connection whatsoever

with CIA.

The Station instructed LICOWLl not to become

an informant on his neighbors.

According to LICOWL-l,

he therefore

told AEQUALITY-1 he did not have time to

collect the information the Soviet wanted.

In view of the lies LICOWLl has been caught in, it

is difficult to assess exactly what the Soviets

VWBLANKET case. The five agents were terminated In July

1972, but the base houses could not be terminated until

January 1973 because It was necessary to sell one and the

termination of the second was tled to the termination of

KDABBEY who owned the second base house. It was necessary

to pay rent for several extra months until these other

terminations could be effected.

I. In response to reference the following is a summary of the

KDFACTOR security review:

The Station summary of the KDFACTOR Project security is

as follows:

""There were no known problems of security relating to

the Project. In response to the Headquarters request, we have

reviewed all phases of the operation and believe that Project

security is sound.

The Project assets have all been with us for

many years and have established themselves as respectable long

time residents of the area. All five assets, four in one family

and one in another, are extremely security conscious and have

all been SGSWIRLED. The assets derive a substantial portion

of their livelihood from their Agency employment and would thus

lose a great deal ll security factors ever necessitated a termina-

tion of their work for us.: As an additional safeguard, the

KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE operations are compartmented

from each other, and there has never been any indication that

either segment of KDFACTOR knows of the other's existence".

The Headquarters desk has also reviewed the security of the

KDFACTOR Project and agrees with the Station that the security

is sound. In fact, as presently constituted, the NDFACTOR

Project is well compartmented, and each of the two FACTOR

photo basehouses (KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) is run by long-

term assets who draw a minimum of suspicion in their operational

activities.

of this project, but that seems unlikely from the Headquarters

review of terminated agents witting of present KDFACTOR

operational activities. A Soviet investigation of property owner-

ship around the Soviet Embassy and their awareness that the

Soviet Embassy was under photographic surveillance in the past

could result in a Soviet investigation of the activitles and contacts

of KDABBEY:I, the owner of an apartment building and four

houses close to the Soviet Embassy. It is doubtfül that KDABBEY-l's

activities, which do not inter-relate with the activities of the

KDFACTOR agents, would in any way expose the KDFACTOR

Project operational activitles.

2. A brief history of the KDFACTOR Project:

The KDFACTOR Project had its origins in the LIERSEY

and LIPSTICK Projects, both active in the mid-1950's. In 1958, after

the arrest of two LIPSTICK surveillance team members, it was decided

to break off the more sensitive, uncompromised LIPSTICK assets manning

and supporting two basehouses for photo surveillance of the Soviet Embassy,

These assets were consolidated with one photo basehouse against the Soviet

Embassy and one surveillance team from the LIJERSEY Project into a new

project (LIEMPTY), which was approved on 16 January 1959. The LIEMPTY

Project, renamed the KDFACTOR Project in 1971, consisted of three photo

basehouses, two viewing the front of the Soviet Embassy (LIMITED and

LILYRIC) and one viewing the rear garden of the Soviet Embassy (LICALLA),

plus a mobile surveillance team (LIENTRAP) tied closely with the LIMITED

basehouse, which was the radio control point for dispatch of the LIENTRAP.

In 1959 the LIENTRAP surveillance vehicle and two team

members vere arrested at the scene of a Cuban demonstration in Mexico

City. A Station review of the security implications of this incident stated

that it did not materially alfect the security of the project nor expose any

of the LIEMPTY basehouse operations. (Note: As the basehouse operations

were compartmented, the only exposure possible from this incident would

have been of the LIMITED basehouse, which is no longer in existence.)

The LIEMPTY Project operated substantially as above until

the Warren Cormission report was published in late 1964. In this publica-

EMIra basthouse. The minteD the basiet me was cased in septe

ember 1964, and all photographic surveillance was suspended as a security

precautio.

In January 1965 the LIMITED basehouse was relocated, and

later that year the building it had previously been in was razed by th

owner, KDABBEY-* From 1964 on it must be assumed that the Sovie

Embassy in Mexico City belleves it Is under regular photographic sur

veillance.

Further project changes took place in 1966 when the LILYRIC

basehouse was relocated to another apartment with approximately the

same view, In May 1968 the LIMITED basehouse was terminated and

LIEMPTY-6, the basehouse keeper, retired. This affected the LIENTRAP

coverage of Soviet vehlcular movement monitored and directed from the

LIMITED basehouse. With the closing of LIMITED and the Station decision

to replace Raymond H. GERENDE, Mexican national contract agent who

handled the LIEMPTY Project since its inception, the LIENTRAP mobile

surveillance team was underemployed, and the decision was made to move

it to the LEMBRACE Project.

This was done in early 1970, soon after

GERENDE had been relieved of operational responsibilities in December

1969.

the Station, by GERENDE, and by KDFACTOR-1, who was terminated

amicably in early 19%. The building housing the KDLITERAL (formerly

LICALLA) photo basehouse was purchased in 1957 by KDABBEY-1 for

the Station. KDLITERAL is in a row of four houses all owned ostensibly

by KDABBEY-1 but actually by the Agency. This row also houses a base-

house for FID's KDVAULT Project. The apartment building housing the

KDABSINTHE (formerly LILYRIC) photo basehouse is owned outright by

KDABBEY-1, who has been most cooperative in assisting the Station in

maintaining and occasionally moving (1965 and 1966) photo basehouses.

The LIMITED photo basehouse was also located on KDABBEY-l's property

when it was active.

old son who lives with them in the basehouse. Neither the son nor the maid

is believed to be witting. The photographic equipment is kept in a locked

room, and the product is kept in a locked safe. KDFACTOR-2 was recruited

by KDCALVERT-1, who is an active, long-term Station agent in the

KDCALVERT Project and who is not considered a threat to KDFACTOR-2's

security. KDFACTOR-2's activities are also known to his brother, the

former LIPSTICK-47, who was one of the two LIPSTICK surveillance team

members arrested in 1958 and who gave the police considerable information

regarding KDFACTOR-2 and the KDLITERAL basehouse. KDFACTOR-2

and his family have occupied the KDLITERAL basehouse since 1957 and

have been discreet and security conscious in their dealings with neighbors

and relatives.

The KDABSINTHE basehouse is manned by KDFACTOR-5, his

wife KDFACTOR-6, and his two sons KDFACTOR-8 and KDFACTOR-9.

The SGSWIRL of 2 March 1966 went into detail on who is witting of

KDFACTOR-5's work for the Station. The result was that his immediate

family, including a married daughter who no longer lives at the basehouse,

are aware of the photographic operation, KDFACTOR-5 was recruited by

LeMPTY, aU., s. citizen with a private company in Mexico City who.

is no longer working with the Station but who is considered patriotic and

no threat to KDFACTOR security.

4. Terminated Agents Possibly Alfecting Present Project Security:

A. Raymond H. GERENDE

GERENDE is a Mexican citizen and was a contract agent

until his termination on 26 June 1970. He had been employed by the Station

Intermittently since 1955 and was used almost exclusively in support activities.

Since the start of the LIEMPTY Project in 1958 GERENDE had been directly

involved with this project serving as cutout to the basehouses, carrying and

processing films, and giving general direction to the project as principal

agent.

In 1969, after years of excellent service with the Station, GERENDE

had serious marital problems which ended in separation from his wife,

KDFACTOR-7. From December 1969 to June 1970 GERENDE was not used

operationally but was maintained on half pay with the hope the divorce pro-

ceedings would be completed quickly. When it became apparent the divorce

would drag on interminably, the Station reluctantly terminated GE RENDE

and his wile.

Bruce H. FERNALD, career agent, met with GoRenDe

monthly from July 1970 through May 1971 while paying him his termination

bonus in ten installments, GERENDE is still living in Mexico City, where

he owns some property and has an income as an English teacher to employees

of two local firms.

He visited his wife and children in Holland in December

1970. It appears he may now be financially pressed as his English class

schedule has been cut back.

The Station as of 10 April 1972 had no informa-

tion that would indicate GERENDE has violated his secrecy agreement.

There is an indication that GERENDE came to the attention

of the Soviets in 1968.

A Mexican walk-in to the FBI office in Mexico City,

who was later interrogated by the Federal Security Police in 1970, said

that in 1968 he had been employed by the Soviet Embassy Second Secretary,

Oleg Masksimovich Nechiporenko (201-305870), to investigate persons

working with the Mexican Olympic Committee. The persons investigated

SECRET

## Page 130

Included GERENDE, who apparently became a specific target of Soviet

investigation.

It is unclear from the report of the Federal Security Police

how far the Soviet-Investigation of GERENDE had proceeded. Nechiporenko

wa's PNG'd from Mexico in March 1971, GERENDE's possible exposure to

the Soviets could have been through his work on the Olympic Committee as

a translator or through his work for the Station, which used him for a wide

range of support tasks against the Soviet and Cuban targets.

B. KDFACTOR-7 (wife of GERENDE)

KDFACTOR-? is a Dutch citizen and the former wife of

GERENDE..

She returned to the Netherlands in July 1970 with her children.

She had served as a support agent assisting GERENDE. She is believed

witting, in general terms, of GERENDE's activities regarding the KDFACTOR

She was terminated on 26 June 1970 and signed both a secrecy

agreement and quit claim.

After termination it became apparent that she

had considerable hard feelings toward both the Agency and GERENDE over

financial problems between her family and GERENDE. While the Station

was not directly involved in all the financial problems, the Station was

Involved in regard to her divorce claims against GERENDE's salary, a

large part of which came covertly from the Station. In July 1970 KDFACTOR-7

came to the Agency Headquarters and complained about her financial settle-

ment. In September and November 1970 she wrote two letters directly to

the Agency on the same subject. In late 1970 she also asked a Hague Embassy

political officer to put her in contact with the Agency; homerer, she did not

tell him the nature of her business. In January 1971 the Ageney contacied

KDFACTOR-'i's brother, a U. S. Army civilian with a 'Top Secret" clearance

living in Alexandria, Virginia, and was able to resolve the financial mis

understandings with KDFACTOR-7. In January 1971 the Hague Station

reported KDFACTOR had, without Station influence, obtained a job as social

secretary with the Department of State at the Embassy. It is believed that

it bit her from expose mast wore with the exey sia should also

such exposure could jeopardize her job. The Embassy in the Hague was

oriefed in general terms on KDFACTOR-7's background.

C. KDFACTOR-1

KDFACTOR-1 is a Mexican citizen and the brother-in-law

of GERENDE. He was hired by the Station in 1956 to assist GERENDE in

processing the photographic take of the KDFACTOR Project (at that time

the LIPSTICK Project and later the LIEMPTY Project). SDFACTOR-1

was later assisted in processing the photographic take by his wife,

LIEMPTY-5, who is GERENDE's sister.

KDFACTOR-1 was terminated

in March 1971, and the photographic processing previously done by

KDFACTOR-1 Is now done in the Station.

The termination was amicable

and largely due to delays in film processing as KDFACTOR-l's medical

practice expanded. " There does not appear to be any security problem

in the termination of KDFACTOR-l as he is discreet and also a close

relative of GERENDE. The security of processing the film in KDFACTOR-l'8

medical office was good as KDFACTOR-l's wife, LIEMPTY-5, was assist-

ing him with the processing and with the security of the darkroom.

D. LIEMPTY-5

LIEMPTY-5 was hired by the Station in 1957 to assist

KDFACTOR-I with the processing of KDFACTOR films.

She is the sister

of GERENDE and wife of KDFACTOR-l. She was terminated along with

KDFACTOR-1 in March 1971.

Due to her close relationship with GERENDE

and KDFACTOR-l, she is not considered a threat to the Project Security.

E. Oliver G. SCANTLING

. SCANTLING is a Mexican citizen who worked as a Station

agent from 1954 until his termination without prejudice in February 197.

SCANTLING is in an excellent financial position and has assisted the

Station in recent years largely because his strong motivation to work

against the Communists. SCANTLING worked as a surveillance team

leader from 1954 to 1957 and then in the LIEMPTY (KDFACTOR) Project

from 1958 through 1966.

He was the cut-out to LIEMPTY-6 and a back-up

principal agent for GERENDE. SCANTLING's termination was amicable,

and he is not considered a security problem to the Station or the KDFACTOR

Project.

F. LEMPTY-6

LIEMPTY-6, a Mexican citizen and long-term Station

asset,

was retired in May 1968. He had manned the LIMITED photo base-

house with his wife and son assisting him. He had been working with the

Station since 1954, but age and ill health had reduced his efficiency.

LIEMPTY-6 knows GERENDE and SCANTLING, but is not aware of the

names or locations of any of the present KDFACTOR agents and basehouses.

While he could give information on his participation in KDFACTOR activities

up to 1968, he has no motive to do this and is apparently happily retired on

his Agency termination bonus plus some financial assistance from his son-

in-law. He is not considered a threat to the security of this Project.

out the LIMITED photo basehouse and may have had suspicions. concerning

LIEMPTY-6. This was a report by KDADAGE-10 that in mid-1966 Stanislav

Sergeyevich Silnikov (201-271103), a Soviet Embassy guard, asked KDADAGE-

10 to report on his neighbors near the Soviet Embassy. Silnikov expressed

interest in all the occupants of the new apartment building which houses the

KDABSINTHE photo basehouse, but did not mention the KDABSINTHE base-

house keepers by name.. Silnikov did name specific persons he was inter-

ested in and these included LIEMPTY-6. NDADAGE-10, of unknown

reliability, said he did not give Silnikov any information,

but added that,

between himself and the Station, he suspected LIEMPTY-6 and had heard

it rumored he worked for the Americans. In 1966 Headquarters already

assumed the Soviets were aware of the LIMITED basehouse because it was

used for radio direction of the LIENTRAP mobile surveillance. In any case,

the Soviets apparently took no action prior to the closing of the LIMITED

basehouse and the relocation of LIENPTY-6 in May 1968.

It is believed

this incident has no implications that would threaten the security of current

NDFACTOR assets.

5. Current KDFACTOR Security Practices:

The two photo basehouses, KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE

remain compartmented, as they. have been throughout the history of the

Project.

The Station case officer responsible for the project meets weekly

with KDFACTOR-2, responsible for the KDLITERAL basehouse, and with

KDFACTOR-5, responsible for the KDABSINTHE basehouse.

In these

meetings he picks up the product, provides new supplies, pays salaries

and handles miscellaneous administrative matters.

These are car meetings

usually held in early morning or at night and the pickup puints are changed

regularly. Meeting time is kept to a minimum and meetings are pre-

scheduled whenever possible. The photographic product is processed in

the Station, thus increasing the security and timeliness of its handling

over the past practice of having KDFACTOR-1 process it in his office

darkroom. The case officer only meets with KDFACTOR-2 and KDF ACTOR-5;

however, in emergencies other witting family members of either basehouse

Can be contacted and met. In case the present sites or personnel are com-

promised, the Station has rented another apartment in the building housing

the KDABSINTHE basehouse and has installed members of the KDCALVERT

Project as residents. This new apartment offers as good a vantage point

Renewal of Project LleMPTY for the period 1 Decem

Is hereby requested.

$26,205 would be spent in FY 1968 and

$17,315 in FY 1969.

The project was budgeted for $45,000 for

FY 1968; funds are avaflable within the Division. Estimated

costs for the coming project year are a little less than the

amount programmed for the provious year and a little more

than what was actually disbursed.

3. LIEMPTY is designed to provide physical surveil

lance of

the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. It covers three

nearby properties (two in front of the Embassy's sole entrance

and

one behind the garden) from which visual and photographic

surveillance are carried out by experienced personnel.

The

project also covers a darkroom where a technician processes

the photographs.

tion

In addition to collecting this basic informa-

on a primary target, certain of the LIEMPTY personnel

are also available for miscellaneous support tasks, such as

servicing postal boxes, and running fixed and moving survell-

lances.

The photo truck which comes under the project is

used on other targets as well, such as CP members, satellite

embassies, and Latin American exiles. One of the basehouses

is also used as a radio dispatch point for the LIEMBRICE sur

veillance team, but this function has been minimized during

the past year in an effort to prevent Soviet interception of

the signal.

The Mexican desk asked the appropriate opera-

tional component of SB Division for specific comment on the

value of LIEUPTY, and received the following:

"This rather unique operation has

facilitates effective targeting.

The

It is

important to note that LIENPTY is not,

Station reporting has been

Information produced is largely for operational purposes and

we often lack detail as to specific utility in a given situ

ation, although we can produce statistics on numbers of photo

graphs produced and numbers of pages of surveillance notes.

It is clear that the FBI is an interested customer and they

have roceived from LIENPTY a great many reports on American

callers at the Soviet Embassy, and valuable support to double

agent operations.

During a conversation on 8 December 1967, the

officer who heads the station's SB section told

the branch

that LIEXPTY is basic and essential to all of his branch's

PROJECT LIEMPTY

REQUEST FOR RENEFAL

1. CURRENT OBJECTIVES

The overall objective of Project LIENPTY, now in its tenth

year of existence, is to collect

operational intormation on the

FISTEAL installation, its personnel and visitors, as well as

related targets of opportunity through stationary/mobile photo-

graphic and physical survelllance mechanisms.

Corollary

objectives which are to be fulfilled through use of the LIEMPTY

installations, mechanisms and personnel are as follow:

To provide detailed operational information pertaining

dally movements and activities of the FJSTEAL

personnel, particularly those individuals of intelligence

Interest,

as well as information on the FJSTEAL physical

plant and visitors to the premises.

2. To collect operatioual information on persons associated

with FJSTFAL persoonel and on individuals known or suspected

to have connections with the FJSTEAL intelligence services

or other hostile groups which are inimical to the interests

Of INFORT.

To provide operational support, counter survelllance

other protective services to WOFIRM personnel and

operations, as may be levied upon the Station or as may be

deemed necessary.

The above objectives are to be fulfilled through continued

exploitation of the LIultEd. LILinic and dical

basehouses,

the LIENTRAP mobile unit, and the services of long

time contract agent, Raymond H. GERENDE.

These objectives are

in consonance with operational directives and Headquarters

requirements as received by Station Mexico City.

C. Throughout the Project year under review, Project LIEMPTY

continued to

contribute

directly and significantly to the fulfil

Headquarters' requests and requirements for

coverage of various

targets fa ling within the above cited frame

During the project year Project LIEMPTY provided nearly

ill of the operational photorranhs and physical surveillance

reports used in Mexico City Station's operations targeted against

the FJSTEAL installation and personnel.

Specific examples of the

LIEMPTY Project's progress and contributions will be found in

2. CHANGES

Operational - Since the institution of the changes described

in the previous reneral request, it has not been found neces

sary or desirable to make further major changes.

minor changes in operational technique have been made in an

effort to obtain continued improvement in the finished product:

• LIMPTY-g's proven effectiveness as an observer (se

aragraph 3 A (3) below) has enabled us to institute

system of special, coverage on specific FISTElL personnel

of intorest, or special coverage of specific time periods

of interest.

The purpose is to permit the Station to gain

greater insights into.the activities and personal associations

of certain individuals, or in overall activities during a

certain time period.

No change in LIEMPTY-O's overall

working hours has been made; rather, flexibility has been

introduced.

2 RTENTRAP, which is now porking more closaly with the

Flexibility has also been introduced into the handling

LIEMBRACE team in order to take greater advantage of targets

of opportunity.

To this end, LIEMBRACE-l has been placed

in direct contact with LIENTRAP,

relieving Raymond H. GRINDE

of this responsibility and permitting GERENDE to devote time

to KHRAVEL activity (see sub-paragraph (3) below).

Ir September and October 1967 GERENDE was employed by

the Mexican SHRIVSL committee.

This position gave him direct

access to FJSTEll and other delegations of interest, and

by the LIEMPTY project.

During the 12-month perlod cited

personnel during their off-duty and recreational hours.

The LICALLA installation his become the most valuable of the

COSTS

Past Project Yar = Project LIEMPTY waS previously approved

for the period 1 December 1966 through 30 November 1967 for the

amount of 45,000 U.S, currency. Station records indicate that

through 31 October 1967, Project LIEMPTY has expended 37,040 in

the field.

It is estimated that a total of 10

,130 will be expended

in the entire project year.

Bi-weekly accountings with pertinent

receipts and/or certifications were submitted by Raymond H. GERENDE

to the Station finance officer via the project case officer for all

LIEMPTY Project expenditures made in the field.

It is estimated

that approximately 5 hours of case officer and 10 hours of analyst

time is required each week to julfill the operational, administrative

and analytical requirements of this project.

in

the amount of 43,520 U.S. currency for the period i

December 1967 through 30 November 1968 (this figure represents &

slight decrease from the amount programmed for the previous project

year).

While no large expenditures are anticipated for the replace-

ment of photographic equipment during the forthcoming period, an

increase in the rental of

the various basehouses may be encountered

as well as the above-cited expectation of salary increases.

through stationary/nobile photographic and physical surielllence mecharisms.

corollary chiatives which are to le'fulfilled through use of the LIEUPTY

Installations, mechanisas and personnel are as follow:

I. To provide detailed operational Information pertsining to the

daily nuremente and activities of the LIBRICK persuanel, particularl

those Indiridualo of intelligence interest, as vell as information

on the IDOLICK physical plant and visitors to the genises.

2: To callect operationel information on persons associated with

LDERICK personnel and on indirf.luala known or susjested to have

connections with the Lhanick intellizence services o. other hostile

groups brich are inimical to the interests of lupura.

3. To porride operntional support, counter surveillance end/or other

protective services to WorACT personnel and operatins, as say be

levies unon the Station or as uny be deemed necessar.

The abore cojectives are to be nulfillei through continued asintenance

and exploitation of the LIKITSD, LILYRIC and LICAllA basedouses, the

2. SHANGES.

Operational - As noted in the previous Reguest for Project Renewal;

the former LINND property nes sold to LINGUSIE, who as per foruel agreen

went with the Station, demolished the old structure and cons-ructed a new

thile it ves initially contemplated to place the LDIYED

(LIRTYs o and -T) persorinel in the new buildini, and to retein the sane,

An Increase in the hours of both the photographic und physical surveillence

coverase proviled fron the new base by the LILYRIC operators (0000-1500

hours) durin the weekdays and to have the LINTIED base provide

photographic and pijsical survelllence coverase fron 1600-1630 hours

on weekdags and fron 0900-1300 hours on weckends. These chances were

aletated by the followins considerations:

1.

The ner LIMOUSINE building offers a such better vantare point

for both photographie and phyoieal surveillance than does the

present coplex

which housen the LILitIc end LIMItaD bases.

Thererore,

the Station relt that the personnel occupying this

new base should be those possessing the highest technicel skills

and also those able to provide the 20st thorough and complete

coverage. Since the LInteD base now has only one treined

operator while the LILTIC basehouse has thre, the lInuc grous

and a revision of vorkins hours wes Inlicatel.

2. Because It was apparent that the coverase of the LInerlick

Inntalletion would be a lon; range and continuin; requirement,

the stetion desired to stell the new bese with personnel of long

range potentisl, Harry-b, now alnost 60 years oli, does not

posses: this potential; horever, the lyric agent complex

happily corbines experienced personnel sith youthfill ajents.

3. Firalia, the social and lInancial status of the liberdo

personnel is such more compatible and consistent with the en-

Vronsent of the nor building than is that of the LINTeD fantly.

CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION

A. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed In relation to project

objectives):

"To collect upcrational Information pertaining to LIMERICK

personnel and physical facilitles.

" SCANTLING has contInued (See the

last two Project Revlews forwarded as attachments to HMMA-140%5,

13 November 1959, and HMMA- 15979, 18 November 1960) to provide

worthwhile Information pertaining to this objective.

a. During the past year SCANTLING has continued to be

used to follow up leads produced by LIENVOY. For example,

perational information recently indicated that the LIMERICK

arget was using the services of a Mexico City firm to repai

safes. Through discreet investigation SCANTLING was able to:

Identify the firm, its location and the name of the owner in the

event that we later wished to make an approach to him or to

exploit this information in another manner

b. SCANTLING is still the Station's primary source for

keeping current records on the residences of the many LIMERICK

personnel in Mexico City. This Is accomplished in several ways;

the most important being SCANTLING's follow up of all LIeNVO

leads which Indicate the LIMERICK people are interested i

renting a given plece of property. (See previous project renewal

request for additional detalls).

2. "To collect operational Information pertaining to other targets

of opportunity, foreign official installatlons and personnel of intelligence

interest operating in Mexico." SCANTLING Is very useful for collecting

information on other Station targets:

SECRET/S

SECRET ANGI

-2-

a. On the basis of a request to the Station from the

ODACID Chief, SCANTLING was sent to Puebla to be an

eyewitness to the 4 June 1961 Catholle Inspred anti-CASTRO

demonstrations.

Not only did SCANTLING obtain the desired

Information, and samples of many of the leaflets used, but he

prepared his report for the Station in time for the COS to give

the ODACID Chief a briefing at 1000 hrs., 5 June 1961.

SCANTLING does an excellent Job on this type of assignment

due principally to his ability to observe and report objecrively.

b. SCANTLING was instrumental in establishing that

Fernando LLANES Cavero and his wife were living at a local

Mexico City address. This case has been of considerable

counterespionage Interest to Headquarters.

c. SCANTLING has continued his contributions to the

Paul Frederick KIRSCHHOFF case by periodie interviews with

the subject's neighbors and assoclates.

3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings,

and surveillances.' SCANTLING has contributed to this objective both

directly and indirectly as will be noted by the examples listed below :

a. SCANTLING devoted a lot of time to the

surveillance and attempted recruitment of Abel ARTEAGA, a

Mexican national employed at the Cuban Embassy, SCANTLING

talked with ARTEAGA several times and undoubtedly was

primarily responsible for the later sucess of the recruitment

nade by another Station agent.

b. Some additional time was devored to the Cesar

GONZALEZ Sanchez case in February 1961 when SCANTLING

determined that GONZALEZ was still in Mexico City. Sce

the last renewal for additlonal detalls on this case.

¿. In connection with the above objective SCANTI.ING

has performed nume rous pretext and neighborhood investigations

for the Station, SCANTLING also does most of the local

Investigations requested by ODACID and other ODYOKE

August of this year glving tradecraft and surveillance

training to LIPAILS 5 and 7 from Monterrey.

this is nöt a direct contriburion to the above objective, it

Is considered sufficlently rclated to mention here.

4. In addition to his contributions to the above objectives,

SCANTLING Is used for miscellancous support requirements from the

Station. For example, SCANTLING is now handling LIEMBROIL-2 and

will continue to do so until the return of LIMOTOR -14 In June 1962. Also,

during the past project year, SCANTLING handled the LIRICE survelllance

ream until July 1961 when Stion D. CLACKETT (ps) returned to Mexico

City. SCANTLING Is also used to spot and rent safe houses and apartments

for other Station operations.

3. As stared in the preceding Requests for Project Renewal,

although SCANTLING'& LIEMPTY Project objectives can never be completely

fulfilled, It. le the Staton's opinion that SCANTLING has made Important and

valuable contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically and to

other Station activitles In general, SCANTLING's production, measured

against monetary expendures, case officer time and other intangible factors,

unquestionably justifies his continuation as an integral part of Project

LIEMPTY.

B.

Raymond H, GERENDE Segment (discussed in relatlon to project

objectives):

1. "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK

personnel and physical facilitles through use of photographic base houses."

Three photographic bases, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA, contribute

to this objective, To avoid repetitior, the Station Is omitting the usual

description of the functlons of these three bases and how they contribute

to the above objective. There has been no change In the coverage as

described In the 1960 Request for Project Renewal.

2. "To collect operational information and Identify operational

leads pertaining to Statlon targets of opportunity." The LIENTRAP

operation, handled by GERENDE, Is still the major contributor to this

SECRET/KOR

## Page 221

• SECRET/

- 4-

objective.

In addition to performing numerous photographic assignments

in support of ocher Station operations, LIENTRAP devoted nearly four

months, on a fulltime basis, to coverage of the LIERODE operation. For

several weeks the entire "take" from the LIERODE target was recorded

from the LIE\TRAP vehicle. Later, the LIENTRAP agents operated the

LIERODE technical gear from the inittal LIERODE stationary base.

3. "To provide operational support to Station operations, 1.e.:

rent hotel rooms and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances.

GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for other

Station operitions and activities. GERENDE's comprehensive area

knowledge and personal operational capabilities combine to make him an

extremely valuable Station asset for such support acrivities. GERENDE

also procures and services post office box letter drops for the many

Station operations requiring them.

4. The quality and quantity of operational Information produced

by the photographic buses and other activitles under GERENDE's control

and supervision is considered worthwhile. The Station concludes, therefore,

that this segment of the LIEMPTY Project should be continued.

C. Relaricaship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

As stated in the previous project renewal, it can readily be noted

that Projec: LIEMPTY has provided support to many Station operations and

in this manner has been a contributing factor to the furtherence of the

Related Mission Dircctive.

The project has not produced any positive

intelligence nor has it been intended that it should do so.

purpose is to provide a mechanism for the development of operational

information in support of other Seation operations.

Il.

CHANGES

There have been no changes in the LIEMPTY Project during the past project

year except that SCAVTLING relinquished control of the LIRICE (formerly LIJERSEY)

surveillance team in july 1961 in accordance with previous plans.

EFFECTIVENESS

There has been no change in Project LIEMPTY which would alter the

validity of the remarks made in Section Ill of last year's project renewal request.

IV. PROBLEMS

The security problem in connection with the LICALLA operation, which

was described in last year's renewal request, Is still present but has not caused

any known difficulty.

base was reactivaied on 29. Muy 1961. The base operator has been cautioned to be

ever alert for any unusual incldents which might indicate that the base has been

compromised.

This is the only problem experienced by the LIEMPTY Project

during the past project year.

V. PLANS

The Station considers that the project is now operating at its optimum size

and does not plan to expand it during the coming year.

Rather, efforts will be

devoted to refining and better utilizing the existing project organizational

arrangements.

vl.

COSTS

A. Past Project Year - Station finance records indicate that Project LIEMPTY

expended $21, 458. 00 during Fiscal Year 1961 (1 December 1960 - 30 June 1961) and

has thus far during Fiscal Year 1962 (through 30 September 1961) expended about

$11, 000.00. It is anricipated that about $8, 000. 00 will be expended during the last

two months (October and November 1961) of the project. year. This will make a

und the dide estimate of s5S),0,. ar. of abou S:0, 500.00, or some S12, 500.00

B. Ensuing Period - Of the total $49, 500. 00 budget, itemized be.low,

$29, 500. 00 should be expended during the remainder of Fiscal Year 1962 and the

balance, $20, 000. 00 should be expended during Fiscal Year 1963. Normal accounting

procedures will be used for all expenditures.

This Information is particularly useful in keeping track of

LIMERICK personel and assisting with the identification of

visitors to the installation, Also, LIMITED maintains a

summary attendance list of LIMERICK employees on a dally

basis;

this enables the Station quickly to ascertain the

presence or absence of an employce on any given day.

- Finally, one other significant service Is performed by this

base; the radio dispatching of the LIEMBRACE survelllance

ream on LIMERICK personnel and targets of opportunity.

LIMITED's photographic coverage is still concentrated on

visitors, as opposed to employees, to the LIMERICK

Installation. A recent example of the base's contributions to

Station efforts Is the case of Joseph Ralph MAURI. In this

case, a LIENVOY lead indicated that an American might visit

the LIMERICK target on a certain day. The base was alerted

to dispatch the radio-controlled survelllance team on any

person appearing to be an American.

The results of this

assignment were Indicated in MEXI-6392 and several other

cables.

LIMITED was also able to provide photographs,

which when compared with photographs provided by Head-

quarters, left no question as to MAURI's identity.

b. LILYRIC - This base's ourput of high-quality clandestine

photographs has been in about the same quantity as last year.

In addition, the base operator, LIEMPTY-l#, prepares weekly

reports on LIMERICK empioyees and their wives,

TILYRIC

alou performs the assignment of noting and reporting the

license plate numbers of all cars bringing visitors to the

LIMERICK installation. LILYRIC photographs also are con-

centrated on visitors to the target, as opposed to employees.

It should be noted that LILYRIC operates for photographic

coverage during the hours from daylight to 1400 hours each

day of the week except Sunday. The LIMITED base maintains

photographic coverage from 1400 hours to darkness each day

except Sunday.

c. LICALLA - As reported in previous correspondence, the

LICALLA base contributes to the collection of operational

information through photographic coverage of LIMSRICK

employees and their families. Also, the base operator,

LIEMPTY-9, supples extremely worthwhile information

pertaining to the apparent positions and jobs of the target

employees. He accomplishes this objective by careful

observation and analysis. LICALLA also maintains a dall

tendance roster of all LIMERICK employees. LICALL

coverage of the target, both photographic and physical

observatioris, enables the Station to keep abrest of LIMERICK

personnel changes, a vital contribution to the Station's counter-

esplonage effort.

%. "To collect operational Information and Identify operational leade

pertaining to Station targets of opportunity." The LIENTRAP operation,

handled by GEKENDE, Is the major contributor to this objective, It

has been possible for LIENTRAP to lake photographs and to perform

pretext Investigations in support of numerous Station activitles. The

cases listed below are cited as examples:

a. In the case of Cesar GONZALEZ Sanchez (see 1, A, 3, a, above)

LIENTRAP was able to procure photographs of GONZALEZ at his

Maxico City residence which, when compared to Headquarters

provided photographs,

lett no doubt that GONZALEZ, was the

subject of interest to Headguarters.

b. LIENTRAP confirmed the Identity of Olga CASTILLO de Ledon,

a frequent visitor to the LIMERICK Installation and an ardent

supporter of the present Cuban regime, through a pretext

Investigation of the residents of an apartment building where

CASTILLO was belleved to live, Later, LIENTRAP supported the

results of the investigation with excellent photographs of the

subject.

ocher Staton operations and activities, GERENDEs comprehensive

area knowledge and personal operational capabilitles combine to make

him an extremely valuable Station asset for such support acrivities.

GERENDE also procures post office box letter drops for the many

Station operations requiring them.

4. It Is the Statlon's conclusion that the money and case officer time

expended on this segment of the LIEMITY project Is worthwhile and

should be continued in vlew of the quality and quantly of operational

informarion produced.

C. Simon D. CLACKETT Segment (discussed In relarton to project

objectives):

I. "To collect operational Information and to identify operational leads

pertaining to the LIMERICK target and Station targets.of opportunity."

During this project year the LUERSEY survelllance team under the

direction of CLACKETT began contributing to the Station's support

efforts through pretext investigatons and physical survelllances. Some

examples of the team's work are listed below:

a. Rafael TISCHILER Guzman (201-64372) Is a Guatemalan

Communist which the team had under survelllance from

November 1959 co April 1960. The survelllance, together

with Information acquired from other sources, eventually

resulted in an unsuccessful recruitment attempt on TISCHLER.

b. Pericles FRANCO Ornes (201-64546) - FRANCO Is a

Dominican of interest to the Station. The LIJERSEY ream

devoted portions of five mouths, January to May 1960, collecting

information on subject through physical survelllance.

c. Jose Maria "Chema" LOPEZ, Valdizon (201-

was the

subject of a physical surveillance during May and June 1960.

LOPEZ Was later iported from viexico through the enoris

of LITEMPO-2.

d. CLACKETT and the LIJERSEY team performed numerous

pretext Investigations on Station targets of opportunity and or

hree separate occasions during the project year served as

a counter-surveillance escort for Station officers in other

operations.

2. CLACKETT, just prior to his resignation in August 1960, spent

about five weeks giving tradecraft and operational skille training to

LITEA-1.

Although not specifically covered by the project objectives,

this ability on CLACKETT's part is considered a significant con-

tribution to the Station's support efforts.

3. In vlew of CLACKETT's resignation, which was cffective 31

August 1960, and the proposed transfer of the LIJERSEY team to

the LITEMPO project, this segment of the LIEMPTY project will

not be renewed. However, for the record, it is considered that

the CLACKETT segment of LIEMPTY was worthwhile and the

expenditure of Station assets In comection with LIJERSEY operacions

were justliled.

• D. Relarlonship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

It can readilỹ be noted that Project LIEMPTY has provided support to

many Station operations and in this manner has been a contr buting factor

to the furtherance of the Related Mission Directive. The project has nor

produced any positive intelligence nor has it becn intended that it should

do so. The project's sole purpose is to provide a mechanism for the

development of operational Information in support of other Station

operations.

CHANGES

A. Simon D. CLACKETT

The unexpected resignation of CLACKETT in August 1960 has

necessitated the decision as how best to utilize the LIJERSEY surveillance

ream and still benefit from the training and experlence gained by the team

during the past year. As explained In the LITEMPO project outline, it was

decided that the LITEMPO Staff Agent would have the time, the need and the

requirements to handle and manage the LUERSLY cam on a regular basis;

consequently, the Station believed that such a solution to this problem would

permit tie Station to cuntlue in profit from. CLACKETT's pagt efforts.

B. Oliver G. SCANTLING

Since CLACKETT's departure, SCANTLING has been handling the

LUERSEY team as an Interim measure pending Headquarters approval of

the LITEMPO project. SCANTLING has been exposed to, and Ilkewise

knows, only one of the team members, LIEMPTY-20. SCANTLING Is

known to L-20 only by an alias.

Wilma J. FIORDALISL

EFFECTIVENESS

General comments pertaining to the value of the project efforts to the

Station's needs - The Station is of the opinion that its operarions are only

as good as the support mechanisins backstopping and contributing to them.

The avallability of unilateral support agents and organizarions, such as

the LIEMITY Projeci, to investigare leads and to colleci operacional

Informatton is an indispensable ingredient to the Station's espionage and

counterespiorage objectives. The Station would be seriously handicapped

in irs operational activitles should the support services of suca agents as

GERENDE, SCANTLING and the agents under their control be suddenly

made unavailable.

B. LIMERICK Target - The basis for most of the Station's counter-

esplonage acrivities directed against the LIMERICK targei require detalled

knowledge of the identity, activities and felloir associates of LIMERICK

personnel, The LIEMPTY phorographic baschouses undoubredly provide

more of this type tiformation than any other Station operation.

production from LIEMPTY pliotographic bases and from the LIEVVOY

project provide the Station with the large majority of LIMERICK leads.

C. Targets of Opportunity - The immedlate avallability of independent

assets to perform investigations, photographic assignments and other

essential types of support services in connection with Station targets of

opportunity represent an operational advantage which this Station considers

highly significánt. Ic ts due to such LIEMPTY assets that an agent can be

sent to distant areas In Mexico to do Investigations, that photographs can

be made of Individuals and places which are of operational Interest and

apartments and hotel rooms can be acquired in fictitious nanies In

support of sensitive operations and activitles.

D. Although the progress and success of any support project depende

upon regulrements from other Station operations, It must be concluded

that Project LIEMPTY has indeed been effective during the past project

ycar.

IV. PROBLEMS

A. Security - The actlvities of the LICALLA base were suspended In

September 1960 as a direct result of the arrest of three KURIOT

technicians by the Cuban Government. One of the technicians was known

to have knowledge of the four LIMUST units (LICALLA' Is located in one

of these units) and the Station considered it appropriate to suspend phoro-

graphic operations pending resolution of the situation. At this time,

there Is no indication when LICALLA operations will be resumed.. The

LICALLA base operator has reported that there have been no unusual

Inquiries or other suspictous actions which might Indicate that LICALLA

has been compromised to LIMERICK personnel; however, such a

possibility will exist untll the release of the three techniclans. No

other security problems have occurred during the past year.

PLANS

A. Processing of Photographg - During the past year considerable

progress has been made in the Station's handling, l.e., sorting, Indexing,

identlfying leads and filing, of photographs produced by the several bases.

B. Photographic Techulques - The previous LIEMPTY Project Renewal

Request indicated that the Station planned to try new techniques using

HY-PAN film in night photography, HY-PAN film-was used on atrial

basts during daylight hours with poor results. Almost invariably, prints

OR

from HY-PAN negatives were too grainy and, consequently, were of

little use in producing good Identified shots of individuals. In vlew

of these experiments, night photography has not yet been attempted.

It should be noted that Eastmar Kodak's new TRI-X PAN film, which

all bases and LIENTRAP now use, Is superior to any film prevlously

used by the Station for clandestine photography. The quality of all

base phorographs have been Increased considerably as a direct result

of this ney film.

C. General Comments - The Station belleves that the GERENDE

segment is now operaring under optimum organtzational arrangments

and chere are no plans for expansion contemplated at this time. It is

expected that SCANTLING will soon be relieved of his interim

responsibility for the LIJERSEY team and can concentrate more on his

Investigative and casing activittes. The transfer of the LUERSEY team

to Projeci LITEMPO reduced Project LIEMPTY activities by an

appreciable amount. It is not planned, durlig the coming year, to

expand present LIEMPTY activities.

COSTS

A. Past Project Year - Station finance records Indicate that Project

LIEMPTY expended $19, 120. 91 during Fiscal Year 1960 (L December

1959 - 30 June 1960) and has thus far during Fiscal Year 1961 (through

31 October 1960) expended $16, 734. 69. Contract Agents salaries and

allowances paid by Headquarters bring the total expenditures for le

months of the projeci year to approsimately $5U, 000. 00. An additlonal

$4, 000. 00 will be obligared during the 12th month of the project year.

This will bring total project expenditures to about $54, 000. 00 for the

entire project year.

B.

Ensuing Period - Of the total $53, 000. 00 budget, itemized below,

$31, 900.00 should be expended during the remainder of Fiscal Year

196l and the balance, $21, 100. 00, should be expended during Fiscal

Year 1962. Normal accounting procedures will be used for all

expenditures.

REVIEW OF PROJECT LEMPTY

(For the Purpose of Project Renewal)

I.

PRODUCT OF THE PROJECT

A.

Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation to project

objectives):

1.

"To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK

personnel and physical facilities. " During the past year SCANTLING has devoted

a significant amount of time to the furtherance of this project objective. Although

other Station operatione and personnel are also concerned with tie collection of

operational information about LIMERICK personnel, SCANTLING's contributions

are unique as to type and complement information received from other sources.

For

example, SCANTLING is used primarily as the source of information about LIMERICK

physical facilities. He is constantly on the alert for building modifications, con-

struction activities and the kinds of outside services utilized by the LIMERICK

installation.

He regularly visite Ine? PARADA de Moreno, the occupant of property

adjacent to LIMERICK, for the purpose of obtaining a close view of the interior

grounds of LIMERICK and to debrief Senora de Moreno about any unusual activities

which she may have observed. At the present time SCANTLING is preparing a

thorough casing report on the electrical power supply used by LIMERICK and all

other residences and establishments in the same block. This operational information

is intended for KURIOT's use and will show all transformers in the block, electrical

meters for measuring the amount of electrical power used and the precise points

where wires enter each property.

Because of his other sensitive activities and

because other operational activities provide adequate coverage, SCANTLING

has been used sparingly for physical surveillances and investigations which might

conceivably impair his future usefulness to the Station. During the time he spent

training Simon D. CLACKETT (ps) in radio controlled mobile surveillance,

SCANTLING did perform some surveillance work at the LIMERICK installation;

however, it was concerned mostly with briefing CLACKETT on dispatching tech-

niques and the procedures used for the control of several vehicles on a surveillance

team using two-way radios.

"To collest operational information pertaining to other targets of

opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence interest

operating in Mexico. " By far the most important contribution made by SCANTLING

in connection with this project objective has been his support to the LITACIT

operation and just recently actually gained entry to the LITACIT target using a

pretext cover story.

During this visit SCANTLING managed to collect highl;

valuable operational information about the security of the installation, which ha:

added materially to KUBARK's knowledge about tararget. SCANTLING has also

cased and prepared reports on the LITABBY target in anticipation of mounting

SECRET,

a photographic surveillance and in initial preparation for a future LINIMENT type

activity. SCANTLING has performed investigations of numerous other Station

targets of opportunity which, depending on their significance, have been reported

in separate correspondence.

3.

"To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefinge

and surveillances. " This objective was included in the LlEMPTY project because

SCANTLING is used to follow up LIFEAT leads and leads obtained from the LIEMPTY

photographic bases. During the past year SCANTLING has investigated a quantity of

leads obtained from the above sources. The information resulting from these in

vestigationa has enabled the Station in maintain current data on the various firms

used by the LIMERICK target and in one instance, Octavio VIDALES (201-

).

caused the Station to make a recruitment pitch in an effort to carry out a technical

penetration of the LIMERICK target. Although VIDALES was not recruited, the

Station anticipates that SCANTLING will some day be successful in just this type of

activity. SCANTLING is the Station's principal source for the follow-up of LIFEAT/

LIMERICK and LIEMPTY photographic base house leads as they pertain to the

primary target.

4.

Not covered by a specific project objective but, névertheless,

of

significant importance to the Station are SCANTLING's contributiona to the overall

Station support efforts. In addition to the extensive training given to CLACKETT,

SCANTLING also prepared a detailed and sophisticated radio dispatch procedure for

use by the LIEMBRACE surveillance team. He deviced a superior method for

numbering streets which enables the radio surveillance team to specify a location

without reference to street names and arcas.

The entire radio dispatch code, when

used properly, practically defies identification as the conversations of a clandestine

surveillance team. From the standpoint of Station security, SCANTLING conducted

an inveetigation of LIVESTOCK-2 based on two leads which were 30 years old and

reported significant information which contributed to the Station's final decision

to terminate LIVESTOCK-?, SCANTLING's other support activities consist of renting

hote. rooms and apartments in fictitious names, supportirg operationg such as

LICOOL-l2 by performing sentry duty and by serving as a capable and responsible

cutout between the Station and agente from other geographical areas.

5. Although SCANTLING's LIEMPTY objectives can never be completely

fulfilled, it is the Station's opinion that SCANTLING'has made important and valuable

contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically and to other Station

expenditures, case officer time and other intangible factors, unquestionably justifies

his continuation as an integral part of Project LIEMPTY.

"To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK

personnel and physical facilities through the use of photographic base houses."

This continuing objective la carried out by three photographic base houses.

LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA. During the project year, LIMITED produced

approximately 3600 photographs and LILYRIC about 4500 pictures of individuale

entering and leaving the LiMERICK target. Most of these photographa were of

nOn-LIMERICK individuals of which only a small, but significant, percentage

could be identified through license plate checks or other typea of routine investi

gation.

The LICALLA base produced approximately $300 photographe during the year.

Most of the LICALLA photographs were of LIMERICK employees and their families

and have been of considerable value in maintaining current and accurate listing®

of LIMERICK personnel in Mcxico. Tho LICALLA base has recently begun taking

• motion pictures of LIMERICK personnel conversing in the garden area.

movies are being forwarded to KUTUBE/D for the possible exploitation of lip

• reading analysis. The LIMITED base, in addition to its photographic assignment.

is also used as the radio central for diapatching the LIEMBRACE surveillance

team on LIMERICK personnel targeta. All bases make routine reports on the daily

attendance of LIMERICK employeen at the installation which facilitates the Station's

reporting on the arrival and departure of LIMERICK personnel. Also, the bases

devote time to reporting the personal associations among the numerous LIMERICK

Some of this latter type information is valuable from the standpoint of

confirming that LIMERICK intelligence officers have a tendency to associats with

their colleagues.

"To collect operational information and identily operational

leade pertaining to Station targets of opportunity." This in a broad objective

and one which is contributed to by the LIENTRAP operation.

LIENTRAP is used

to provide photographic coverage of important Station targets which do not justily

a more permanent photographic base. During the period under review, LIENTRAP

has been used for the timely coverage of various Central American exile group

activities, the Confederacion de Trabajadores de la America Latina (CTAL)

-headguarters, several counterespionage targets, the LITACIT and LITABBY

targets and other one-time operations of intelligence interest. The operational

information produced by LIENTRAP is used by the Station for increasing

operational knowledge about a target and, when appropriate, has been incorporated

in separate reports to Headquarters with other information about specific targets.

"To provide operational aupport to Station operationa, i. e., rent

hotel rooms and apartmente, and conduct counter-surveillances." GERENDE,

because of his area knowledge and operational acumen, is used frequently by the

Station for renting hotel rooms and apartments in fictitioug names for use on other

He is also the Station's principal procurer of local Post Office

boxes for use as letter drops. This objective pertains entirely to the operational

support of other Station operations and is an invaluable ingredient to the security

of important Station activities.

SECRET

The production of operational information as represented by

LINITED, LILYRIC, LICALLA and LIENTRAP is an important adjunce to the

Station'e coveraje of the LIMERICK target and Station targets of opportunity.

It is the Station's conclusion that the expenditure of KUBARk assets, I. 0., money

and case officer time, is justified and that these activities should be continued.

C. Simon D. CLACKETT Segment (discussad in relation to project objectives):

1.

"To collect operational information and to identify operational

loads pertaining to the LIMERICK target and Station targets of opportunity. " Very

little production has been realised from this objective in tering of CLACKETT'g

contributions. CLACKETT returned to Mexico in early April 1959 after receiving

surreillance, tradecraft and photography training in Headquarters. He then spent the

rest 01 April, May and part of June being trained by SCANTLING in mobule sur

veillance techniques. Then LENPTYs 15, lo, 17 and 20 were placed under his

supervision and he began training these agents in the arts of foot surveillance and

mobile surveillance.

show the excellent effects of CLACKETT's intensive training sessione. Although

LIEMPTY-I7 has resigned and the team consiats of only four agents, including

CLICKETT, the Station believes that the team will be ready within the next month

to begin its contributions to the above objective.

Z. Based on the training time deroted to CLACKETT and to the LIJERSEY

team and the anticipated production during the coming project year, it is the Station's

opinion that this activity should be continued.

II.

EXTENT TO WHICH THE RELATED NISSION DIRECTIVE HAS BEEN

FURTHERED.

Project LIEMPTY has provided support, in varying ways, to a majority of

Station operations and in this manner has been & contributing factor to the furtherance

of the Related Mission Directive. The project is not intended ror designed to

produce positive intelligence; its sole purpose is to provide a mechanism for the

development of operational information in support of other Station operations.

PROGRESS OF THE OPERATION IND PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE.

A. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment:

1. SCANTLING's duties and responsibilities are basically the same

now as they were when the original LEMPTY project outline was submitted. Since

SCANTLING is the only major factor in this part of LIEMPTY, progress, other than

covered in the above section on production, can be measured only by the fact that

SCANTLING is a year older and bas acquired a lew more heipiul trickè of the trade

SECRET

## Page 253

SECRET/

and, consequently, has increased his own operational abilities.

• 2.

Insolar as future planning is concerned, SCANTLING will

continue to devote the greater portion of his time to the LITACIT operation. In

addition, he will continue his work againat the LIMERICK target, l.e., investi-

gating LIFEAT and photographic base house leads in connection with the objectives

of the LIENPTY and LIMESA projects.

The Station still plana to maintain

SCANTLING as an independent Station asset free from the responsibilities of super

vising other agente and operations.

3.

SCANTLING will probably continue providing administrative

support to LIEMPTY -3 (now covered under the LICOOL project), but will not be

responsible for the operational direction of L-3.

B. Raymond H, GERENDE Segment:

1.

During the past year the three photographic base houses have

been trained in the use of a faster type film (HY-PAN) to facilitate the taking of

photographs on dark cloudy days. One base, LICALLA, has made tests and recently

begun making. 35mm color slides using the new fast type Ektachrome film. This

film is now processed in the Mexico Station dark room which heretofore was not

possible.

It ia the Station's opinion that a few colo, photographs of target personnel

will be useful for identification purposes. The LICALLA Base has also, during the

past year, begun taking 16mm motion pictures in color with the expectation that

Headquartera can eventually provide lip reading analysis of conversations taking

place in the garden area of the LIMERICK installation.

2.

Other operational progress has been made in connection with

relieving GERENDE of responsibility for the LIJERSEY surveillance team. This

row leaves GERENDE with a sufficient amount of time to supervise all photographic

base houses, LIENTRAP and the outside photographic laboratory.

Future planning in relation to this segment does not call for

expansion. Rather, the Station plans to perfect some of the photographic procedures

c.

Simon D. CLACKETT Segment:

1.

CLACKETT's assumption of responsibility for the LIJERSEY

• surveillance team has been a progressive step for the development of an additional

" and much needed support ascet. Although the LIJERSEY team has been in existence

fur several years, it was only during the past year, with the assignment of

- CLACKETT, that an intensivo effort was made to train the team members and to

i place them under tho supervision of a full time team leader. As mentioned above.

CLACKETT has done an excellent job during the past few months in getting the

team ready for future operational assignments.

2.

The Station plans, during the coming year, to increase the

atrength of the LIJERSEY team by at least two agents and one car. Thia would

then give a total LIJERSEY complement of six agenta and three radio care. The

Station will continue to take all necossary precautions not to rush the development

of the team nor to give it assignments which are too complicated and too difficult.

It is anticipated that the team will begin some surveillance work within the next

month on targets connected with plans for an expanded Communist Party pene

tration prograns.

Iv.

PERFORMANCE OF PRINCIPAL AGENTS IN TERMS OF PRODUCTION,

SECURITY AND COVER

Oliver G. SCANTLING - As should be expected from a well trained

and motivated agent,

SCANTLING's production during the period under review was

excellent.

His production is in the category of operational information rather than

positive intelligence and is based on leade and investigations given him by the

Station. He never fails to do a thorough and detailed job on all assignments

given to hini.

He is an unusually valuable, principal agent. There have been no

security problems or developments during the past year in connection with

SCANTLING's assignments. Likewise, his cover is very good and places him

in a position to maintain his work for KUBARK for many years to come.

Raymond H. GERENDE - Since GERENDE's marriage in December

1958, his performance has improved to a marked degree. He has become one

of the Station's most dependable agents in terms of promptness for meetings,

completing operational assignments as rapidly as possible and in doing any task,

regardless of how menial it may be. Insofar as the Station and GERENDE know,

his cover with LISTERINE's firm has held up very well, In fact, GERENDE

recently was able to negotiate a sales contract with a customer having a very

large sales capacity for the product manufactured by LISTERINE'e firm. This.

of course, endears GERENDE tO LISTERINE in addition to contributing to

GERENDE's cover employment. The only significant security incident pertaining,

in part, to GERENDE was in connection with LIENTRAP (please see HMMA-13951,

1ó October 1959, for detaila).

Simon D. CLACKETT - CLACKETT's performance has detinitely

measured up to the standards expected by the Station. He has proved that he

is conscientious, dependable and very quick in grasping the details of clandestine

activities. He will undoubtedly continue to improve his personal performance au

SECRE IDE

## Page 255

SECRET

he gains more experience. There have been no security problems or incidents in

connection with CLACKETT's assigament to this Station. Although the notional

cover provided by Headguarters has hold up very well during the past few monthe,

the Station had hopes of placing him in LILABEL'e firm and obtaining Inmigrante

papers for him. However, for reasons mentioned in other correspondence, thie

cover arrangement did not work out. The Station is continuing efforts to locate

another suitable local cover job for CLACKETT.

v.

CONTACI, AND COMMUNICATION.

A.

Oliver G. SCANTLING - The Station Case Officer meets with SCANTLING

on the average of three times each week.

For regular mectings, a total of eight

prearranged contact points are used alternately with SCANTLING "walking the beat"

and being picked up by the Case Officer in the latter'e car.

This procedure enables

both the agent and the case officer to check themselves and to check each other for

possible surveillance. Meetings are generally of short duration, seldom more than

30 minutes, and are held in the car. It is possible for SCANTLING to get in touch

with his case officer by telephone, and vice versa, in case an unscheduled meeting

is necessary. SCANTLING and the Station are currently working on the details of

an emergency means of contact utilizing SCANTLING's wife's relatives in PBPRIME.

Headquarters will be advised of these arrangements to facilitate contact with

SCANTLING in the event Mexico is overrun by hostile forces and contact with the

Station is severed.

B.

Raymond H. GERENDE - GERENDE's Case Officer meets with him five

times each weck. Meetings are conducted in the Casc Officer's car using the same

• procedures as outlined above. GERENDE and his Case Officer have a total of 11

contact points in different areas of the city and generally hold their mectings during

the early morning hours, usually about 0800. As in the case of SCANTLING,

GERENDE and his Case Officer are preparing an emergency contact procedure which

will facilitate Headquarters communications with him through his relatives in PBPRIMI

Headquartere will be advised of these arrangements just as soon as they are completed

C. Simon D. CLACKETT - The Station Case Officer meets with CLACKETT

n the averageof three times each week. The same type of communications pro

edures as used for SCANTLING and GERENDE are employed with CLACKETT

The Held Project Outline submitted with IC'A-l1257 us noproved

on 16 January 1959 without change, for the period 1 Necerber 1958 through

30 hovenber 1959 for a total of 195,330; $65,500 for the current fiscal

year and 129,200 for fiscal year 1960.

An amondment to the original request for project approval mes

subaitted before the original project sas approved..

requested approval to include Sinon D. CLACK:TE (Ds) and illna J. TORALISI

(ps) under the LIN:PTY Project effective l January 1959 and remove them

Iron the LIMail Project.

The funds designated in the original to for

the undesignated staff Agent were usod to cover the expenses for CLACKETT

and FINiaIsI. Therefore no additional funds were requested for the

project in thia smenment.

Too approval on lo January 1959 included ti18

nroject amendment.

A copy uf the avendent request is being forwarded

for your infornation and records.

3o isong the Staffs' corments on the LISPIl Troject, the following

recommendations were nade.

KUDaK suggested that the Case Officer should

work at devising ostenaihle sources of incones for the agents which will

stand the scrutiny of trienda, relatives and lass friend; forces.

4o An asandent to CLiCKSTis contract has been requested to allow

for a cuartars allowance.

The educational allowance requested in partrach

11 of the project amendment was disapcroved because CLACKTTT was a Contract

The Quarters Allowance of $2,520 was tumed down because 1t vas too

bizi in relation to CLACKETT' a salary. Therefore, a quartera allosuce of

$1,800 has beer: approved and will be written into CüCKSTle contract. Il,

horever, oparational and cover reasons require CLACKET to rent an apartnant

lunger than the one he would cornally obtain under his allowance, tre Cief

of station can authorize the artra rent sa au operational expense which will

not be considered as compensation for WACkiTT and thorefore not tubinct to

persons entering and learing the main gate of the LTIRICK Installation.

carrying people to and fron the LiMKiCk initallation; and prepare an observation

diary on all-target personnel seen euch day. (This peraita the Station to tell when

a target peramality is cut of town or not vorking for nose other reason. )

The LITYRIC Bare was originally acquired and made operative to provide for

continuous coverage of the target in the event LIMITSD is ever coupronised.

In atill the primary value of having two bases cover the same portion of the target.

LILYRIC 1s compartaented Bron INITSD and with the possible exception of CERENDE

could probably weather any security flap involving LINTID. Obviously, there 1a

some duplication in the vork of LINITED and INTLYRIC; horever, the insurance value

of having two basdo 1e quite apparent.:

SORREE

LIRIC bas been operating for about two and one half yeara and insofar as

the Station knova, no compromising security situations have arisen.

LICATIA - The LICALLA Base is located in a position where photographa can be

taken of people within the LUNKRICk garden ares.

In addition, the operator of the

LICALIA Base subnita reekly reports ön LIMERICK construction vort, dally loge show

Ing when a target indiridual was seen that day, and reports showing the association

of target individuals vith one another.

LICAtA photographs are processed and handled

In the same manner and by the people who handle the LIMIND and LILYRIC pictures.

The LICALIA Base van acquired and operations began about two and one half

yearo ago vith tbe prinary purpose of obtaining additional operational information

concerning WINRICh personnel, and operational leads which could be exploited for

the physical penetration of the INCRICK installation.

Approdinataly one year ago

the LICAIIA, Base vss purchaned by STARK through ITNOUSINS. LICALIA vIll probably

remain at its present location and vill continue to subult photographa and reporte

of the sane type as are now being submitted. Other than the fact that ITEMPTY-9,

the LICALLA operator, is the brother of former LIPSTICK-47, no security problems are

currently known to the Case Officer.

Hovever, reports fron LIPSTICK2 12 and 30, the

local pollce, the attorneys involved in the case,

Avisable for adainistrative efficiency to Include the LIJERSEY insete within ti

framerork of the LIMPIY Projest. Other than LILYRIC, which has already been

discussed, LIJERSEY conalate of a foot survelllance team with three members, IMPTi.

and LTEMPTY-17. Lor about one year.

They heve not developed lato as competent a surveil

lance tean an the IPSTICK tean was and probably never vill become sa good.

The

LIJERSEY tean bas been'used mostly for stationary vurveillances and observations of

people of interest.

LIEMPTY-17, however, haa also been used as & pretext investigator.

Ho bas excolled at this type of vort and the Station continues to use him in thia

capacity.

The. Station has been reluctant to use the LlJERSEY team as much as 1t

could have been

uned because of the close ausociation of the team with GRANDS and,

in turn, GRENDE's knowledge and work on LIFPAI and the LIPSlICK surveillance team.

The Station plans to recrult several agento of a type and social level more suitable

for all types of surveillance work than the present LIJERSEY team.

011ver G. SCÄVILING - SCANTYING hau been associated with KUBARK for several

yeara in a number of different capacities.

He was originally used as a member of

the LIPSTICK surveillance team and later was bead of the same team.

He haa been

used to train new agents in tbe techniques of survelllance and lnvestigation, to

acquire offico upace and apartments for the Btation'@ operations and to conduct

Investigations and pake recruitment approaches to individuals of operational Interest

SCANILING is currently being used by the Station as an investigator of

LIMESA lenda andia atill actively pursuing the LTESA/MKLIGHTINO operation.

SCANTLING also malotalna regular contact with LTEMPTI-3 and monitora his elicitatica

effort against the LICOQI-6 target, In this connection, both SCANTLING and LINPIY-3

meet regularly with Doria M. KILIGO for operational guidance. (Note: Please see

peditious exfiltration of GERaNDE and SCATTING fron Mexico should a security

altuation arise which would necessitate this.

12. Control and Motivation:

Contral • All LTEMPTY agents are local nationals. GERINDE and BCANNIO,

both of whom spent a great deal of their childhood years in PAPRIME and st1l1

bave relatives living In FBPRIMS, are in many respecta more pro-"BPRIME than

many PHPRIMS citizens.

control over GERENDE and SCANTLING stens directly fron their pro-PBPRIME bellefs

and their personal loyalty to their past and present Case Officars. The control

over other LIMPTY agents is based in part on pre-PAPRIME attitudes and on the

Inancial remuneration and food handling they received from GRINDE and SCANTLINO

lealistically, control over LIEMPTY agents is based on mutual understandings an

confidence among Individuals and should any agent decide to denounce PEPRIME O

UBARK, as the case may be, there is not much that the Station could do.

D. Motivation - With the exception of GEREND and SCANTLING, whose primary

motivations are ideological

financial compensation seems to be the basie

motivational factor surrounding LUMPTY agents.
