SUBJECT: NEW LEFT MOVEMENT

INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS

i'.1.

This is to recommend that our field offices

prepare over-all quarterly reports on the New Left movement

in order that ve can bring together all pertinent information

concerning this activity and be in a better position to

assess the movement's militancy and potential for violence.

The New Left movement is made up of numerous

organizations, temporary conferences and unaffiliated

individuals each promoting in varying degrees

a strong,

anti-United States, violent, revolutionary position.

Although the field

has conducted or is conducting investi

gations of these individuals and organizations, there is

to compile in a single investigative report a clear-cut

picture of the entire New Left movement which will identify

its leaders, sources of funds and propaganda outlets, and will

show the extent to which the New Left movement has been

influenced by domestic and foreign subversive elements.

Our plan is to have each office submit an initial

report by 12/1/68 and to thereafter submit reports on a

quarterly basis.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the attached

airtel with enclosures consisting

of report outline, subfile breakdown and reporting schedule

be sent to all offices ordering the preparation of these reports.

RE: NEW LEFT MOVEMENT

Within 30 days of receipt of this communication,

recipient offices are to advise under this caption the iden

cities and file numbers of individuals to be included under

the expanded Key Activists Program on a UACB basis. Included

should be a brief statemont relating the basis for designating

each individual as a Key Activisi.

At that time, under

individual case caption,

a communication is to be forwarded

to the Bureau outlining

what specific steps are being taken

to obtain adequate informant coverage of the individual.

It is expected the Key Activists Program will be

given intensive investigative attention and close supervision

by participating offices.

You should be continuously alert

to

recommend additions or deletions where warranted and not

wait for the Bureau to call to your attention the need to

Include an active, obvious leader of New Left activities in

your division.

Such communications should set out key Activist

in parentheses after the character and contain adequate justi-

lication for recommended action.

Key Activist should not,

however, be used in the caption

of any communication prepared

for dissemination.

These individuals will be included in the

Security Index in

Priority I.

To insure that the Bureau is kept abreast of the

day-to-day activities of the individuals designated as Key

Activists, each office must maintain high level informant

coverage on them as well as the organizations they are

aftiliated with to develop information regarding their sources

or tunds, foreign contacts and future plans.

Live informant

explore all avenues of investigative coverage and submit any

recommendations under appropriate case caption for consideration

by the Bureau.

All investigative matters pertaining to the New Left

movement are being closely followed by the Bureau. Key Activists

are considered to be of primary investigative importance and

cursory handling of these cases will not be tolerated. The

overall objective of this Program is to render Key Activists

ineffective and thereby radically

restrict their influence and

the effectiveness of the New Left movement. In order to obtain

the desired results, it is expecteu intensive, aggressive

investigation will be afforded these casos.

NEW LEFT

MOVEMENT

100-446997

It is imperative to note the shift to violence

in the New Left movement.

Sabotage, arson, bombing and a

varioty of obstructive tactics have been openly advocated

during the past year.

In September, 1968, within a five-day

period three ROTC establishments were sabotaged and a fourth

threatened

In addition, a Central Intelligence Agency office

at Ain Arbor, Michigan, Was bombed

curing that month. These

instances of openly made plans for violence and the brazen

follow through of action are examples of the problems facing

the Bureau in this field and the absolute need for intensive

investigative efforts in these matters. Successful prosecution

is the best deterrent to such unlawful

activity. Intensive

investigations of Key Activists under this Program are logically

expected to result in prosecutions under substantive violations

within the Bureau's investigative jurisdiction.

NOTE:

The Key Activists Program was initiated to afford

critical cases close supervision to insure intensive

investigation by the field. Success with this Program

warrants broadening its scope.

The above instructions are

to bring about an expanded Key Activists Program to afford

closer supervision of critical cases working toward making

these persons ineffective and impairing the New Leit movement.

NEW LEFT MOVEMENT

INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS.

i.

The Bureau has noted increasing evidence of a

continuing upsurge on the part of militant individuals and

organizations

to separate themselves from legitimate protest

activitles and to adopt a sirong, anti-united states, violent,

revolutionary position.

These activities are commonly referred

to as the New Left movement.

The term "New Leit" does not

refer to a definite organization, but to a movement which is

providing ideologies or platforms alternate to those of existing

communist

and other

basic revolutionary organizations, the

so-called "Old Left." The New Left movement is a loosely-bound,

whee-Wheeling, college-oriented movement spearheaded by the

Scudents for a Democratic Society and includes the more extreme

and militant anti-Vietnam war and antidrait protest organizations.

Whe militant leadership of these organizations appears determined

co continue to stage militant demonstration activities designed

primarily to eltect confrontation with authority, particularly

with the Federal Government.

Although the field has conducted, or is conducting,

investigations of these individuals and organizations,

there

is

"a need to compile in a single investigative report a clear-cut

New Leît movement so that we may expand and intensify our

investigation of those phases indicating a need thereoi.

It will also serve to alert Government officials concerning

the nature and extent of this aspect of subversive activities

and will provide a comprehensive study of the whole movement

from which its dangerousness to the national security can be

assessed.

In order to obtain this picture, a program is being

instituted immediately to prepare quarterly reports on the

over-all New Left movement throughoui the United States.

Chicago is being designated office of origin and seven copies

of all reports should be submitted by each fieid office.

The

initial report, which should be submitted to reach the Bureau

by 12/1/68, will cover approximately the past two years of the

New Leit movement. It will include information heretofore

reported under various titles and, of course, there will continue

to be a reporting of this type of information under various

other titles. Alter submission of the initial report, future

be submitted on a quarterly basis according to

the enclosed schedule.

The initial report in this matter

and succeeding

reports will be designed to precisely spell out the full extent

of the New Left movement. It will separate words and intentions

from actions, mere participation from direct influence and the

bona fide activist from the mere "do-gooder." Offices which

have absolutely no information to report, either in the initial

report or the quarterly reports therearter, will be permitted

to so advise the Bureau by letter in leu of a report.

The enclosed report outline should be followed as to

the numbered and lettered items.

Where further breakdowns by

numbers and letters are practical, it will be permissible to

do so. The synopsis should be prepared for the purpose of

providing a complete summary from which the strength of the

movement in each field office territory can be quickly determined

and a conclusion drawn by the reader as to the movement's over

all militancy and potential ior violence. Make certain the

synopsis is factual and supported by data in the details.

Subfiles have been opened for each office and for

each topic. All communications and sections of the report

should refor to the appropriate subliles which are shown in

the enclosed subfile breakdown.

This is to recommend that our field offices conduct

a survey concerning publications of the New Left movement in

order to (1) provide for a centralized reporting of New Left

propaganda efforts, (2) to enable us to keep abreast of

current New Left activity in order that we may take advantage

of situations which could embarrass the New Left and (3) to

facilitate the necessary evaluation and analysis of New Left

propaganda at the Seat of Government.

BACKGROUND:

The New Left movement uses propaganda for various

reasons ranging from morale boosting to the generation of

public resentment of Government policy and action.

There is

an urgent need to afford New Left propaganda efforts close

attention and a survey of this nature will be of great value

тат

not only to the Seat of Government but to the individual field

offices in providing an over-all picture of New Left propaganda.

One of the most important aspects in our current

investigation of the New Left movement Involves the movement's

propaganda activities.

We must afford this phase of New Left

efforts close attention so that we can keep abreast of current

New Left activities, take advantage of situations which could

embarrass the New Left movement and counter New Left propaganda.

In this connection, the prompt, accurate submission of

newspaper clippings is also essential to the Bureau's keeping

promptly informed on these matters.

With the foregoing as a background to underscore the

importance of this matter, the Bureau desires that all offices

Immediately initiate a detailed survey concerning New Left-type

publications being printed and circulated in your territories

on a regular basis.

This will include both the official

publications of New Left movement organizations as well as the

anarchist-type underground newspapers which are being printed

on

a regular basis.

Your survey should set forth iniormation

RE: NEW LEFT MOVEMENT

PUBLICATIONS

100-446997-72

Data developed should be set forth in a comprehensive

and effective manner so that the picture of New Left movement

publications in your territory may be quickly grasped.

It will be your responsibility to secure and

carefully revier issues of New Left-type publications in

your territory and to take appropriate action on each article

of pertinence.

It will, of course, be your decision as to

whether the pertinence of the information is such that the

Bureau should be immediately advised or whether it should be

merely included in the publications section of the next report

on the New Left movement.

Following this survey, which should reach the Bureau

by 11/26/68, each office should

critically appraise its knowledge

of New Left-type publications within its division and should

comment specifically on the desirability and necessity of

instituting an investigation of any of these publications under

the provisions of Section 87E, Manual of Instructions.

You should also submit your recommendation concerning

publications which should be furnished the Bureau on a regular

basis in view of their ideological

contame,

the as at do on on tat oft

coming

New left functions oo -er content

of continuing orch-

interest to the purcal.

When a separate case is opened on a specific New

Left-type publication, a copy of the appropriate communication

should be designated for Bureau file 100-446997-72 in order

that a ready reference will be available concerning New Left-

type publications under investigation.

BACKGROUND: By C. D. Brennan to W. C. Sullivan memorandum dated

3713/70,

you were advised of facts surrounding the explosion at

do vest Ilth street, New York City, Involving the Weathermar

raction ot sis. You were also advised correlative investigations

Involving our interests in Weatherman individuals involved in the

explosion, and possibly bombings in New York and elsewhere, were

being vigorously pursued and pertinent information furnished

local police. The Director noted, "pursue vigorously."

...

By C. D. Brennan to W. C. Sullivan memorandum dated

11/20/69, the Director approved investigation of all individuals

connected with the extremist and violence-prone Weatherman faction

As you are aware, the Department has under consideration

Indictment of approximately 25 national and regional Weatherman

leaders for their violent acts in Chicago during October, 1969.

In early February, 1970, Weatherman leaders implemented plans to

go underground and form

commando-type units to engage in bombings,

arson, and assassinations as political weapons to bring about

the revolution.

We are conducting extensive investigations in

the field to locate, the Weatherman leaders, and most of them are

inciuded among those who may be indicted.

NI SLE Cathyllkerson, for example, a Weatherman Leaderevedse

Memorandum to Mr. W. C. Sullivan

RE:

STUDENTS FOR A 'DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY (SDS)

Further evidence of the violent nature of the

Weatherman leaders is shown by the attempted bombing of Detroit

In New Yorks City on 3/12/70 by a group calling itself "Revolutionary

Force 9, the members of

which obviously are sympathetic to

Weatherman objectives.

OBSERVATIONS: It is imperative the field be made fully cognizant

of the importance of our investigations of all aspects of suspected

Weatherman activity,

including bombings, arson, and locating

Weatherman individuals and leaders.

The identification of

leatherman communes

and locating activists in them make readily

available a suspect list for our use or the use of local authorities,

where we have no jurisdiction, in instances of bombings and arson;

and in the event the Federal indictments are returned in Chicago,

such a list would facilitate locating them as fugitives.

Because of the known violent nature of the Weatherman

faction, including extensive use of bombings and reported purchases

of firearms

and ammunition, it is considered imperative, for the

safety of

"Agent personnel, that the field utilize a cautión state-

ment on all Weatherman organization correspondence and on all

correspondence under individual captions concerning Weatherman

personnel. A suitable caution statement would be, "All Weatherman

personnel should be considered dangerous because of their known

advocacy and use of explosives, reported acquisition of Iirearms,

and known propensity for violence. i*

RECOMMENDATION: The attached airtel to the field be approved,

setting torth the following:

1.

Apprising the field of current information

concerning Weatherman violence.

2. Requiring the field to advise the Bureau on a

weekly basis of the location of or attempts to locate selected

Weatherman leaders.

3.

Requiring use of above-described caution statement

on Weatherman correspondence.,

BACKGROUND:

The following is set forth in response to suggesti

from several Special Agents in Charge and participants in the

recent New Left Movement Conference held on 9/10-11/70 that the

topic of New Left extremism be included in scheduled and future

law enforcement conferences and meetings, where attendance is

restricted to police, prosecutors and the judiciary.

Current Bureau policy concerning speeches by Special

Agents in Charge or Assistant Special Agents in Charge on

New Left matters is set forth in SAC Letter 70-8 dated 2/10/70

captioned "Speech Matters - New Left." This directive states

that Special Agents in Charge or Assistant Special Agents in

PRECORDED COPY

Charge cannot accept speeches on the subject of communism, and

this policy was to be followed in reference to speeches on the

subject of the New Left.

The SAC Letter continues that in the

event questions are asked concerning the New Left following the

talk by a Bureau representative, replies should deal only with

the questions of

FBI jurisdiction. Persons asking questions

should be tactfully referred to appropriate Bureau reprint materi:

be held to a minimum and submitted only in connection with

appearances before command-level law enforcement administrators.

An exception to this policy was made, however, in

September, 1969, at which time Special Agents in Charge were

permitted to include material relating to the activities of

New Left extremists in their presentations at the 1969 Annual

Law Inforcement Conferences, which concerned extremist groups

and violence.

These presentations were exceptionally well

received and

OBSERVATIONS:

Many New Left extremists and extremist groups have

criminals.

They have directed their attacks, which includer

arson and bombing,

against police and police installations

from coast to coast and have participated in bank robbery.

'Is little doubt that local law enforcement is as concerned with

these elements and the threat they present to our society as

reported that local police are looking to us for briefings

regarding New Left individuals and groups who are dedicated

to violence, terrorism and disruption.

Enforcement

Our 1970 Annual Law

Conferences deal with bombings and bomb threats,

and some Special Agents in Charge have requested permission

to include at these conferences a discussion or briefing

regarding New Left terrorists, including those who are Bureau

-fugitives.

It is believed we should permit the Special Agent in

selected groups of local law enforcement command and supervisory

personnel regarding New Left extremists, extremist groups

(B) NEW LEFT AND BLACK EXTREMIST TERRORISM - INFORMANT

COVERAGE - You have been advised in the past of the growing incidents

of terroristic acts by the New Left and black extremists and the need

for intensification of our investigations and development of new sources

to combat these escalating problems.

However, a review of the New Left Movement - Violence

airtels submitted monthly by each field office indicates generally that

• your informant coverage of terrorist organizations and individuals is

grossly inadequate.

You are, therefore, instructed to immediately institute

an aggressive policy of developing new productive informants who can

infiltrate the ranks of terrorist organizations, their collectives,

communes and staffs of their underground newspapers. The Bureau

fully recognizes that the development of sources to penetrate these

groups is made extremely difficult because of their immoral conduct

and use of drugs. It calls for initiative and new approaches to develop

the needed intelligence information.

Concerning black extremists, it is essential that quality

informants are developed at a regular rate. These informants shouid

be the type who can obtain advance information concerning planned

acts of violence or who are in a position to furnish information concern-

ing contemplated acts of violence.

You should include in Item 4 of your monthly airtel on

"New Left - Violence; Internal Security - Miscellaneous (Weatherman):"

as outlined in Bureau airtel to all offices May 13, 1970, constructive

plans to implement the program outlined above concerning New Left

terrorist organizations through informant development. Recommendations

relating to the development of a specific source or plan of action should

be submitted to the Bureau by separate communication.

(C) SECURITY AND RACIAL INFORMANTS -- Never in our history have

we been confronted with as critical a need for informant coverage. Ter-

roristic violence surrounds us and more has been threaiened. Bombings,

assassination of police officers, kidnapping and murder are all part of

the picture. Fanatics are at large who are at war with the Government

and the American people. Particularly critical is the need for reliable

information about the activities of violence-oriented youthful groups on

campus.

As you are aware, you have been previously instructed not

to use campus student informants under the age of 21. In view of cur-

rent circumstances, you are authorized to develop student security and

racial informants who are 18 years of age or older. This presents you

with a tremendous opportunity to expand your coverage, which is

expected. However, in no way are your obligations to exercise

selectivity and tight control lessened in this most sensitive area.

Appropriate manual and handbook changes are forthcoming.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

PURPOSE: To obtain approval for the attached airtel

implementing intensification of our investigation of Hey Left

Ism within limits of available manpower.

BACKGROUND: Director previously approved implementation of

intensified investigations of New Left terrorism with available

manpower recognizing no additional manpower will be available

until after July, 1971.

Attached C. D. Brennan to W. C. Sullivan memorandum,

14/30/70, recommended implementation and Mr. Soyars' Addendum

thereto opposed it until a determination was made at Seat of

Governnent as to what programs the manpower would come Irom.

The Director concurred with Mr. Soyars.

A previous field-wide survey disclosed 451 Agents

regularly assigned and 741 for peak periods were necessary for

full implementation. The recommendation (attached memorandum,

430270) to implement intensification now with available manpower

was made to cope with an imnediate and accelerating problem.

Implementation cannot be instantaneous, as to manpower needs,

and it is anticipated manpower can be shifted to this work

based on the judgment of individual Special Agents in Charge

as to the essential work to be done in that office and priority

need there for Agents to begin implementation of intensive

investigations of New Left terrorism.

* It Is also recognized

considerable work reductions are to be made in other areas of

work within the next 60 days to free additional Agents for this

work.

+5E15 5-5-78

Specifically, reductions or elimination of specific

security programs should free 31 men. Lettersto all Special

Agents in Charge are being prepared along this line.

followed. Changes approved by the Executive Conference con-

cerning handling of interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor

Vehicles (ITSMV) cases and Deserter matters should be in effect

about 7/1/70, and should relense about 216 Agents.

In addition, continuing scrutiny is being given all

our operations to insure maximum utilization of manpower on

essential work, and the Inspection Division, now in New York

and later in Washington Field and other offices, will pursue

this objective.

OBSERVATIONS: It is not belioved we should delay implementation

of these intensified invnstigitions pending availability of 451

men.

Implementation

3 shout

harin, within limitations as described

above, bearing in

mind cortath manpower shifts are available now

with more forthcoming.

The need for manpower adjustments between

offices will be closely followed.

As the rate of implementation

Increases, the field will in about 60 days be able to shift a

considerable number of wen to New Left terrorism investigations.

An assessment of the manpower situation by office to reach the

Bureau by 6/15/70 should give us a realistic view of the manpower

situation at that time.

The tragic, violent aftermath of violence and destruction

on our campuses following the President's speech on Cambodia is

a clear warning of the impact of New Left terrorist philosophy

and advocacy of street action, The ability of radical activists

to seize

a controversial issue and whip up violent reaction

among large crowds is again demonstrated. The threat to the

Nation's ability to function in a crisis

situation posed by

New Left extremists has never been more clearly drawn. This

grave threat requires innedinte and positive steps be taken to

fulfill our responsibilities for protection of the internal

security of the Nation.

Implementation of our intensified

investigations of New

Left terrorism along the above lines within

the limitations of available manpower

1s imperative.

RECOMMENDATION: The attacked

airtel to the field be approved to

begin rapid implementation of intensified investigations of New

Left terrorism, briefly indicating steps the Bureau is taking

along the above lines to permit reassignment of manpower.

It

also instructs the field

to submit by 6/15/70 an assessment of

their manpower situation at that time.

(WEATHERMAN)

BUDED 6/15/70

ReButel 4/17/70 sets forth six specific areas of

Investigation of New Left terrorism considered for intensifi

cation.

Begin implementation of investigations of New Left

terrorism promptly with available manpower and scale of

implementation should be as rapid as possible.

For purpose of investigations of these individuals,

New Left terrorist is described as one who adheres to Weatherman

ideology o1 advocating a Marxist-Leninist revolution now and

uses terroristic tactics in furtherance of revolution. Activist

may or may not belong to an organization which adheres to this

IdeOLOgY.

Using this definition, an arrest during course of a

Weatherman action, such

Chicago in October, 1969, gives reason for rebuttable presumption

that arrested person

is

adherent to Weatherman ideology of

violence and revolution described above.

Mere denial of

adherence to Weatherman ideology during interview would not be

adequate rebuttal.

Because of serious consequences to public

positively disprove such adherence to Weatherman ideology must

exist prior to closing any investigation. i

REG

It will be especially important during this investi

gation to not only establish

the potentisel MAngordiness of all

those following Weatherman ideology,

but also their place of

residence.

Communal living follows

good

Weattorman lifestyle and

guide to individual's adherence to Weatherman ideology.

If individual resides in communal existence follow instructions

concerning these investigations set forth in retel. Determine

the source of income of these individuals. Valuable infornation

may come from establishing close liaison with local police

sources who have interest in these individuals because of their

propensity for violence and increased use of narcotics.

Consider all individuals falling in categories noted

for inclusion in Priority I of Security Index unless investigation

dictates otherwise. Advise Bureau of your reasoning if not

included. If individuals arealready on Security Index, you must

have established

sources who can closely follow their

current

whereabouts. Advise Bureau by letter every 45 days of individuals

in Priority I of Security Index, in these categories, of their

current residence and any other

pertinent information developed.

Consider all individuals defined previously for interview

during investigation.

Adhere

to Bureau instructions concerning

interviews of security subjects. Purpose of interviews is three-

toid; to determine their cooperativeness with FBI, to possibly

develop them as informants and to ascertain if they have any

knowledge of Weatherman members currently wanted under the

Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution warrants.

To facilitate handling at Bureau, all reports and other

communications on individuals falling within defined categories

will include the name Weatherman in the character whether or not

ne is a Weatherman member, e.g.: SM - SDS (Weatherman), SM - ANA

Weatherman) and SM • C (Weatherman). Bureau expects

close coopera

tion among all offices, and while one office may be considered

office of origin, any office with leads must handle same promptly

and

efficiently.

Bureau will not tolerate a lackadaisical approach to

this matter. Potential propensity for violence by individuals

adhering to violent tactics of Weatherman group makes it our

responsibility to keep on top of situation.

Agent personnel

must be aware of possible criminal violations on part of these

individuals and submit communications to Bureau under appropriate

caption if warranted. If local warrants are issued on these

Individuals and facts are present, consider contacting Local law

enforcement agencies to determine

if there is justification for

FBI entering case under Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution

statute.

Due to escalating nature of New Left terrorism, submit

setting forth: (1) identities and location of conmunes or

organizations under investigation that adhere to Weatherman

ideology (2) number of cases opened during month on individuals

under categories previously mentioned (3) total number of cases

on these individuals presently under investigation (4) informant

coverage used against specific communes and organizations that

fall wichin defined categories, and (5, brief summary of New Left

oriented violence occurring in area during preceding month and

action taken.

Above instructions supersede those in Buairtel

to selected offices,

3/12/70, under caption "Students for a

Democratic Society (Weatherman), IS - SDS."

Problem of New Left violence and terrorism is serious

one and is growing. We must handle it at this time with existing

personnel complement of Bureau.

As rapidly as possible begin

shifting personnel to this work from other work areas, except

for personnel specifically designated for organized crime work,

with emphasis on accomplishing necessary objectives rather than

desirable ones. Closely scrutinize work load fluctuations and

changes in your office. To secure manpower a continuing study

is being made at Bureau and by Inspection Staff to curtail work

requirements and streamline. Refer to SAC Letter 70-25(B),

5/5/70.

Major changes are contemplated around 7/1/70 in handling of

ITSUV and Deserter matters to enable more significant diversion

of manpower. Instructions will be forthcoming on this.

Bureau recognizes Agent personnel estimate sent in reply

to Butel 4/17/70 is not binding and you are not required to build

up to any specific estimated figure. Bureau is concerned primarily

with getting vital aspects of intensification of these investigation.

To obtain approval of attached airtel to all offices

emphasizing the need to develop specific information about

campus violence concerning movement of known agitators, funding,

non-student status of agitators, communication

links between

campuses and identity of those arrested.

BACKGROUND:

In accordance with your instructions in line with

specific directions of the Director, the field is being

instructed to intensify efforts to develop more specific

information along the above lines.

The need for developing this type of information, which

could be used for possible prosecutive purposes, was the subject

oi a letter from the Internal Security Division of the Department

dated 2/18/69, and forwarded to the field with appropriate

instructions by letter to all Special Agents in Charge number

69-15, dated 3/4/69.

OBSERVATIONS:

}

In view of the recent nation-wide, violent, campus

oriented

disturbances involving numerous instances of

arson and

other terrorism, there is a clear need to remind the field of

these existing

InstructIons.

It is essential, also, to alert

the field to possible links

between off-campus terrorists, such

as Weatherman groups, and the extremely violent activity taking

place on campuses in

the recent past.

The Bureau has noted an increasing tendency toward

loose reporting of campus disturbances along lines of news

media accounts.

You are to comply with existing instructions

to identify organizing groups or individuals, include subversive

background where available in reporting communications, and

include organization primarily responsible in descriptive

Mere reporting of numbers involved and action engaged

These matters must receive expeditious

attention, and close supervision.

PURPOSE:

To recommend that

each office be instructed to develop

new initiatives and programs in the development of sources to

penetrate extremist groups including communes and their underground

newspapers.

BACKGROUND :

By airtel 3/12/70 to all offices captioned "SDS

new informants to report on these organizations. On 5/13/70

an

airtel was sent to all offices captioned "New Left Movement -

Violence, IS - Miscellaneous (Weatherman) " which established a

procedure whereby each office was to submit an airtel to the

. "

Bureau by the first of each month outlining five categories

including the following information:

(1)

identities and location}:

of communes or organizations under investigation that adhere to

Weatherman ideology,

(2) number of cases opened during month on

individuals under categories previously mentioned, (3)

total

number of cases on these individuals presently under investigation

(4)

informant coverage used against specific communes and

organizations that fall within defined categories, and (5) brief

summary of New Left-oriented violence occurring in area during

preceding month and action taken.

The recent terroristic acts by these groups indicate

a need for new and imaginative steps in the development of its

sources to be included in

Item 4 of the monthly airtel outlined

above.

EX-109 REGIST-411-520

Accordingly, each field office is being advised

initiate a program to develop these needed sources

and to

incorporate this information in their monthly airtel to enable

-the Bureau to carefully evaluate the field's progress and advise

_LEFT. MOVEMENT - FINANCES

IS - MISCELLANEOUS

PURPOSE:

To obtain authority for the attached airtel to

• the

field requesting financial information concerning New Left

groups.

BACKGROUND:

By memorandum C. D. Brennan to W. C. Sullivan, dated

11/7/69, the Director approved a letter to all offices pointing

out the

recurring allegations that various tax exempt charitable

toundations have contributed large sums ot money, directly or

indirectly, to the Movement. It was also pointed out similar

allegations recur concerning financial "angels." The field was

instructed to be particularly alert to such allegations and any

information developed along such lines should be promptly reported

to the Bureau with recommendations as to whether additional

investigation is warranted.

By letter dated 2/26/70, in response to a specific

request, we furnished the White House with material concerning•

income

sources of revolutionary groups. Such an inquiry is

Indicative of the high-level interest in the financial aspects

of revolutionary activity.

Because of the sensitive nature of any direct intensive

financial investigation of large foundations or funds, prominent

wealthy individuals who limit their activities to financial

support, or politically oriented groups such as the Vietnam

Moratorium Committee, embarrassment to the Bureau would likely

result. It must also be noted such financial support is so

diverse as to frequently be in the form of furnishing bail money

to persons jailed during disturbances, purchase of equipment,

and underwriting costs of large rallies or meetings. Such

aid rarely would be picked up in our review of bank records

of the organizations involved.

OBSERVATIONS:

In order to put these recurring allegations into

perspective and be in position to be responsive to tuture

high-level inquiries along this line, it would be desirable

to obtain from the field a

comprehensive survey of known

instances of financial aid by foundations or funds, prominent

or wealthy individuals, or politically oriented groups, at

the same time it would be a propitious instance to reiterate

the Bureau's interest in these matters on a continuing basis.

The attached airtel to the field be forwarded

as wess as support by politically oriented groups such as the

Because of interest in the sources of funds of

of the Government it is essential to get the above allegations

into proper perspective.

You are instruated tO surVey YOur ilLeS to determine

any instances where financial support, including glits oi

or individuals by 1) tas-exempt charitable foundations or

funds; 2) prominent or wealthy individuals, or other individuals

who have contributed over 91,000 in a single contribution;

3) politically oriented groups including unions.

Such support

would include and not be limited to, furnishing bail money to

NEW LEFT MOVEMENT - POLICE TRAINING MATTERS - Recent

developments involving violence caused by New Left terrorists have

increased requests from the field for qualified speakers to appear before

selected local law enforcement officials to discuss New Left extremism

and violence. This subject matter was included in the 1969 Annual Law

Enforcement Conferences and the presentations were highly successful.

The Bureau, therefore, will consider requests from the field for Special

Agents in Charge or, in their absence, Assistant Special Agents in

Charge to brief local law enforcement command and supervisory

personnel regarding New Left extremism and violence at law enforcement

meetings and conferences where attendance is restricted to full-time,

duly constituted law enforcement officers.

In such appearances, you should restrict your comments to

information appearing in the document, "Youth in Rebellion," previously

provided to each office, to information available to each office in its New

Left quarterly reports, and to data provided by the Bureau.

Any briefings or speeches scheduled for local law enforce-

ment officials regarding New Left extremism and violence should be

reported in advance to the Bureau, utilizing Form FD-132, and your

letter should clearly justify the desirability of the presentation and

should stipulate that all in attendance will be full-time, duly constituted

law enforcement personnel. Each such appearance will be examined closely •

to determine if it is justified and will be worthwhile.

Very truly yours,

PURPOSE:

To obtain approval of attached airtel to all offices

which instructs the field to initiate investigation of all

members of the Students For a Democratic Society (SDS) and

procommunist New Left-type campus organizations.

BACKGROUND:

Memorandum dated 10/29/70 from the Executives

Conference to Mr. Tolson recommended that investigation be

initiated of individual members of the SDS and members of

procommunist New Left campus organizations who follow SDS

ideology. The recommendation was approved by the Director.

At the end of the 1969-70 academic year the

factionalized SDS, with the exclusion of the Weatherman

faction, had a membership of about 2,500 individuals.

The

procommunist New Left-type campus organizations have

a

membership of about 4,000. The purpose of the investigations

of these individuals is to determine the propensity for violence

by members of the above organizations.. Attached is an airtel

to all offices advising of investigation of all members of

the SDS and nilitant New Left campus organizations.

RECOMMENDATION:

In order that the Bureau remain aware of the number

of such cases handled by the field, the field is being

instructed to include figures as to cases opened and cases

closed on the administrative

pages of the quarterly New Left

reports.

No handbook or manual changes are necessary.

lembers of the SDS to be investigated should include

Bureau is aware that many IDs chapters are unstructurad, and

formal nembership is not a requisite forparticipating in

SDS

activity.

As you are avare, SDS and other similar subversive

campus-oriented groups are clearly symbolic of violence and

Marxist-Leninist revolution on the Nation's campuses. As

their intent has crystallized, the adherence to this philosophy

of revolution and violence is, of necessity, more inherent

among members and followers.

These groups undoubtedly are

the breeding ground for revolutionaries,

extremists and

terrorists.

logic and good judgment should be used in these

investigations, bearing in mind the objective is to identily

potential and

actual extremists, revolutionaries and terrorists

and to assess their threat to the internal security or tue

Government.

EPA contains photograph and biographical data for over

550 black and white-hate extremists, black extremists who are

fugitives in bureau criminal cases and extremist informants who

aid in covering travels of extremists within the U.S. and abroad.

Each field office and 12 of our Legal Attaches maintain EPA.

There are constant additions to and deletions from the

EPA; therefore, it is deemed advisable at this time, and annually.

hereafter, to review the EPA to insure its contents are current

and accurate.

individuals included in EPA, office of origin, and office of

origin file number.

Letter instructs: 1) Each office to verify

that list contains all names of individuals from their office who

are currently included in EPA. and that individual's name, office

of origin and file number are

correctly set forth. 2) Additions,

deletions, and changes in office of origin or file number should

be brought to the attention of the Bureau within 45 days.

The purpose of this

the

memorandum

is to/recommend

1 that

Black Nationalist Photograph Album (BNPA) be renamed the

Extremist Photograph Album and that it be expanded to include

extremist individuals in Klan and similar white extremist groups

meeting criteria for inclusion.

It is also recommended. the

attached airtel be sent all offices and Legal Attaches (Legats),

Paris, Ottawa, and Mexico City, advising them of changes.

The BNPA is available to all offices, Legats, Paris,

Ottawa, and Mexico City, Central Intelligence Agency, and Royal

Canadian Mounted Police.

Currently it includes a photograph.

biographical data and, where appropriate, confirmed felony con-

victions of individuals who are militant black nationalists, leaders

but not necessarily limited to black extremist groups, black

extremists who are fugitives in Bureau criminal cases

and

extremist informants who travel in behalf of their respective

extremist organizations. Approximately 484 names are

included

In the BNPA.

Visit

•The BNPA has been a valuable investigative aid in our

investigations of black extremists who travel by making available

photographs and background data. Inclusion of extremist individual?

in the Klan and similar white extremist groups who come within

the above criteria for inclusion in the BNPA would prove equally

valuable. It is estimated that approximately 25 to 30 individuals

ISABECO

connected with Klan and similar white extremist groups will be

added as result of the above.

i.

If approved, appropriate Manual changes will be made

and form-FD-432 will be revised for submission of data

in

connection with the BNPA.

Bureau letter 3-11-68 instructed that a Black

Nationalist Photograph Album be maintained in each Bureau

office. Although the original instructions were to include

the photographs of subjects known to travel, it now appears

logical to include the photographs of the principal leaders

of any black extremist organization, as experience has shown

that they can be expected to travel

2ls0.

The inclusion of photographs of racial informants,

particularly those in the Black Panther Party, should be

considered as the availability of such photographs could

simplify investigations when the infornants travel outside

their own divisions.

Those informants who have traveled for

their respeciive black extremist organizations, or who are

COMM-FBr

These photographs and

their descriptions should bo handled just as those oi any

other subject and they should not be distinguished in any tay

The availability of these photographs has proved

to be an excellent investigative aid and greatly simplifies

the handling of leads by auxiliary offices.

Each office

should review the matter at this time to determine it other

subjects or informants should be included.

At recently completed special black nationalist

representatives from 42 field offices, it was recommended

that a photographic album be prepared

and distributed to.

all offices to include photographs and biographical data

on militant black nationalists who are known to travel

extensively. It was felt that such an album would be of

definite benefit in identification of these individuals

should they turn up in different areas of the country.

Those offices having militant black nationalists

residing in their territories who are known to travel

considerably should furnish all other offices in the conti-

nental United States with photographs and biographical

data on the individuals known to fit the above description.

As new subjects are developed, photographs and

Biographical data should be furnished in line with the above.

PREPARATION OF PHOTOGRAPHIC ALBUM

INTERNAL SECURITY - BLACK NATIONALIST

G.

The recently completed special black nationalist

conferences which ended 3/5/68 took cognizance of the fact

that many militant black nationalists travel extensively

throughout the country and appear publicly at various events,

conferences, and other meetings.

The conference felt that the distribution Field-

wide of a photographic album of those militant black nationalists

would be most helpful for identification purposes should one

of these

individuals show up in a particular field office

territory. It is estimated that this album would not exceed

50 individuals, all prominent in various black nationalist

movements.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the field be instructed to prepare such

album. If you agree, there is attached a letter to all

offices containing appropriate instructions.

The recently-held racial Intelligence conference

noted the fact that various black nationalist organizations

frequently call conferences or conventions of various types,

some on a regional and some on a national basis. Some

conferences are called for the purpose of forming new organi-

zations such as is the case in Detroit at the present time

where black nationalist leaders in that city have called for

a national conference in late March of this year for the

purpose of forming a Malcolm X society in honor of the late

Malxolm X LIttle,

the militant black nationalist leader who

was killed in 1965.

the conference recommended that, based on submissions

• from the field, the Bureau prepare and furnish all offices

on a monthly basis a calendar of scheduled racial events

~ throughout the country which are more than local in nature.

The conference felt that this would be beneficial in field

coverage of these events, noting the widespread travel on

the part of some black nationalists in attendance at various

conferences.

It is believed that this suggestion is entirely

feasible, that in the Raciel Intelligence Section we can

correlate this matter on the basis of information contained

in regular correspondence from the field, and that it can be

furnished all offices on an economical and timely basis.

It should result in a savings, in that undoubtedly, intraoffice

resulting

in a savings in Agent and stenographic time in the field.

ACTION:

If you agree, we will begin the preparation of a

racial calendar of coming events and 'furnish it to all offices

on a monthly basis. No communication to the field is necessary

at this time and the field will be advised of the implementation

of this prectice when the first calendar is issued. Thereafter,

the matter can be handled by routing slip rather than formal

Reference is made to my memorandum of May 16, 1974

providing you with our opinion that investigation by the

FBI of the Nation of Islam (NOI) should continue. In the

interim we have had an opportunity to further consider whether!!

the NOI's activities appear to violate certain statutes such

as Title 18, United States Code, Sections 231, 233 (Civil

Disorders) ; Z41, 245 (conspiracy to Deprive ana Deprivation oi

Civil Rights); and 2101 and 2102 (Riots).

In my May 16 memorandum, I informed you that I considered

it inadvisable to base continued investigation of the NOI on

Executive Order 10450 until the question of the continuation

of the Attorney General's list was resolved. On June 4, 1974

the President signed Executive Order 11785, which abolished

the list and prohibited its use by any agency of the Govern

ment. However, Section 8(a) (5) of Executive Order 10450, as

revised by Executive Order 11785, requires that investigations

conducted pursuant to Exécutive"Order 10450 shall relate to;

to whether the continued investigation of the NOI is appro-

priate. However, the General Crimes Section of this Division

has recommended continued investigation for the reasons set

forth in my May 16 memorandum and on the basis of potential

violations of 18 U.S.C. $$ 2101 and 2102 (Riots).

Accordingly, continued investigation of this group is

warranted because

its reported

activities appear to come

within the criteria of Executive Order 10450, may involve

potential violations of 18 U.S.C: 8$ 2101 and 2102 (Riots)

and, finally, represent a potential threat to the

public

"safety as described in my May 16, 1974 memorandum.

As I have previously indicated, you should consult

further with the Department to reassess the basis for con-

tinuing the investigation if information is developed that

the NOI

has changed its tactics and objectives and has

assumed an attitude of non-violence.

whether the investigation of the NOI should be continued

FbI repuits of the uctivities of the organization, its

members and activities, and consultations have been held

with members of your staff. As a result, it is our opiniont

that, for the time being, investigation of the NOI should

continue.

With respect to your specific questions, although our

' review of FBI reports indicates that NOI may have engaged

in activities which deprive citizens of constitutional

rights, and, therefore, it would come within the criteria

of Executive Order 10450, the Department is currently

reviewing the Attorney General's list for the purpose of

determining whether its

continued existence is warranted.

Therefore,

I do not think it advisable to base continued

•administered by this Division as to whether NOI's activities

should be investigated in light of statutes over which they,

and we, have jurisdiction.

A basi; for continued investigation was described by

Deputy Ass stant Attorney General Kevin T. Maroney when he

testified efore the Committee on Internal Security of the

House of

epresentatives on February 20, 1974. He pointed

out, intr: alia, that without a broad range of intelligence

informat: 'n, the President and the departments and agencies

of the Executive Branch could not properly and adequately

protect our nation's security and enforce the nunerous

statutes pertaining thereto.

There is, in our view,

sufficient evidence to indicate that certain NOI members

have been involved in disturbances and attacks on police

throughout the country as noted in reports disseminated

to the Department of Justice, other executive agencies and to

the Secret Service in connection with its responsibility for

the rotecliu di the riceident. Under these circumstances,

I feel the Department, and in particular the Attorney General,

must continue to be informed of those organizations that engage

in violence which represent a potential threat to the public

safety. Therefore, continued investigation of this group is

warranted.

If, during the course of your investigation, information

is developed that the NOI has changed its tactics and

objectives, and has assumed an attitude of non-violence, you

should again consult with the Department to reassess the

basis for continuing the investigation. In the interim,

I will apprise you of our decision as to whether NOI's

activities appear to violate certain statutes, e.g, Title 18,

United States Code, Sections 231, 233 (Civil Disorders),

241, 245 (Conspiring to Deprive and Deprivation of Civil

Attached for your approval is a memorandum to the

Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, requesting an

opinion be furnished at this time as to whether the activities

of the Nation of Islam (NOI) come within the criteria of

Executive Order 10450, or its activities are in violation oI

any other Federal statute.

The Department is also being

requested to advise whether the investigation of the NOI

should be continued.

BACKGROUND:

The NOI, founded in Detroit, Michigan, in 1930, 7000/

15. am

semi-religious black organization with over

members in 120 units, or Mosques, throughout the United states.

Foreign units exist in Bermuda,

Jamaica and British Honduras.

Elijah Muhammad, 75-year-old Supreme Ruler of the NOI, operates

from NOI national headquarters in Chicago, Illinois.

This group

seeks to establish a separate black nation, disavows

any allegiance

to the United States Government, preaches a distorted version of

the Islamic religion, and teaches all whites are "devils" who will

be destroyed by the forces of nature. NOI beliefs are propagated

weekly via distribution of over 500, 000 copies of the NOI newspaper

"Muhammad Speaks" and by transmission of NOI teachings over the

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re:

NOI a $3 million noninterest loan and promised an additional $6

million of assistance.

Qatar and Abu Dahbi have donated $100,000

and $125,000,

respectively, and Kuwait has indicated it is

considering a $2 million gift.

We have conducted a continuous security-type investiga

tion of the NOI since 1953. Periodically, and most recently on

July 12, 1966, we have requested the Department's opinion concern-

ing possible prosecution of the NOI under appropriate statutes

or its designation under Executive Order 10450.

The Department

has repeatedly declined to take action against

the NOI Citing

lack of adequate evidence of specific acts by its leaders resulting

in force being utilized or violence occurring, as well as referring

to the quasi-religious nature of the NOI as a further deterrent to

successful prosecution.

In view of the character and activities

of the NOI,

the Department requested by memorandum July 28, 1966,

that the NOI continue to be the subject of active investigation

and that the Department be furnished the results for examination

for possible violation of Federal statutes and for possible

designation under the provisions of Executive Order 10450.

During the period April 2, 1973 - May 25, 1973,

five

one week in-service sessions of specialized training in black

extremist matters were conducted at the FBI Academy for selected

representatives from each FBI field office except Anchorage and

Honolulu.

It was the consensus of those attending these sessions

that the NOI certainly warrants our continued investigative

attention in view of its substantially increased potential for

violence inthe past two years.

As a

considerable period of time has transpired since

the Department's last request for investigation regarding the

NOI, and in view

of the increased propensity for violence of this

group, it appears in the Bureau's best interests to seek :

decision from the Department as to whether a prosecutable violatior

exists concerning the NOI and as to the desirability of continuing

this investigation.

ACTION:

II approved, the attached memorandum be forwarded to

Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division.

Recently a suit for refund of income taxes for

the years 1966 and 1967, was instituted in the United

States District Court for the Northern District of

Illinois, by Muhammed Ali. The suit seeks recovery

of $97,048.68 for the years in question based upon

a claimed deduction for contributions made to the

Holy Temple of Islam or the Nation of Islam.

In

the

earlier of the two years Muhammed Ali allegedly

made a substantial contribution to the organization

and then borrowed the money from it on the same day.

As to that transaction we, of course, are maintaining

that there was no true contribution and that the two

transactions effectively eliminate any claim of

deduction.

As an alternative defense for the first

year, and as a defense in the second year as well,

we are also contending that the recipient organi-

zation was not one to which deductibility contributions

could be made since, under the statute, part of its

earnings inured to the benefit of certain individuals,

namely its leader Elijah Muhammed and members of his

family.

Reference is made to your memorandum of July 10, 1966

1964

wherein we discussed the operations of the NOI and particu

larly the type of evidence which would be needed to initiate

actic. against the organization for designation under Sectiong

8(a) (5) 0f Executive Order No. 10450.

The results of the investigations conducted in this

matter have been closely followed and it is noteworthy that

since our last communication there has been no significant

change as to the character and tactics of the organization.

The Fruit of Islam and Military Girls' Training groups con-

tinue to function and the role of the white man as a devil

and snake continues to be the central theme of all

preachings of the minister in the various temples. It is

also to be observed that the leadership continues to deni-

gate the American flag and advocate disobedience of any

law contrary to the beliefs of the Muslims.

While it is clear that the leadership preacher's dis-

trust of all other groups and that the membership owes

allegiance only to the Muslim Cult,

, the tenor of the

preachings are in the nature of religious prophecies subject

to, be fulfilled at some unknown future time by the Supreme

power, Allah.

o1 Executive Order 10450 or its activities are in violation

OBSERVATIONS:

The Nation of Islam is an all-Negro semireligious

organization which advocates a doctrine of violent hatred

of the United States Government and the white race.

The

organization is headed by Elijah Muhammad with headquarters

in Chicago, Illinois. We have conducted a continuous

security-type investigation of this organization since 1953.

Periodically, we have requested the Department's opinion

as to possible prosecution of the Nation of Islam under

appropriate statutes or designation under Executive Order

10450, most recently on January 31, 1964.

The Department has repeatedly declined to take

action against the Nation of Islam, citing lack of specific

acts of force or violence by its leaders or members.

Department makes repeated reference to the quasi-religious

nature of the Nation of Islam as a further deterrent to

successiul prosecution.

Recognizing the threat to the

internal security of the Nation posed by the Nation of Islam,

the Department has requested our investigation be continued

and the names of appropriate Nation of Islam officials be

included in our Security Index and that they be considered

fox apprehension during a period of national emergency.

CONFIDENTIAL

Berat

This will refer to your memorandum of January 31,

1964

wherein you request an opinion whether in the light of the

additional information furnished by the Bureau since May 16, 1963

With reference to the above entitled organization, the activities

of the NOI come within the criteria of Executive Order No. 10450,m

or whether its activities are in violation of any Federal

statute

within the jurisdiction of this Division.

There is insufficient evidence to warrant proceedings

for violation of any Federal statute within the jurisdiction of

the Internal Security Division's responsibility.

Section 8(a) (5) 0f Executive Order No. 10450 provides

Ior the designation of "any foreign or domestic organization,

association, movement, group, or combination of persons which is

totalitarian, Fascist, Conmunist, or subversive, or which has

adopted, or shows, a policy of advocating or approving the

commission of acts of force or violence to deny other persons

their rights under the Constitution of the U.s., or which seeks

to alter the form of government of the United States by unconstitu

tional means".

The NOI cannot be designated as subversive under

Executive Order No. 10450 unless the evidence available proves

its activities to be in the category of "subversive, or which

has adopted or shows, a policy of advocating or approving the

commission of acts of force or violence to deny other persons

their rights under the Constitution of the U.s.,. ..

The investigative reports indicate that most of the NOI

temples have Fruit of Islam and Military Girls' Training (FOI - MGT)

groups which drill in secret military tactics.

These drills include

training in judo and karate, and in some instances with guns.

At every meeting

the white man is characterized as a devil, a

snake who has tortured the Negro and always will; that this white

devil must be exterminated along with his black sympathizers;

that the white man was alloted by Allah, their Supreme

power, a

certain period on this earth and this period is now up; that all

NOI members must await the signal from Elijah Muhammad to indicate

the beginning of the extermination of the white devils to make

room for a Negro takeover of the country; that such a signal

be forthcoming momentarily.

Moreover, the NOI leaders,

Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X and others, preach that they must

have a part of the territory of the United States as their own

exclusive territory together with suificient financial means

to set then up economically independent. At their meetings, the

NOI members denigrate the American flag

•and-advocate disobedience

of any law contrary to the beliefs of the Muslims.

This reported information, however, is insufficient

to prove a policy of advocacy or approval of the comnission of

acts of force or violence to deny other persons their rights

under the Constitution of the United States.

The activities reported must be shown to be more than

mere prophecies or utterances

made with the hope of ultinate

attainment of their desired aims.

For example, while teaching

that the white man must be exterminated they do not say by whom

or how.

There should be available evidence to show that the

advocacy or approval of the commission of acts of violence to deny

others their Constitutional rights is calculated to

incite the

members to action now or in the foreseeable future.!

Evidence

is needed to show the specific acts taken by particular individual

leaders in advocating or approving acts of force and violence;

not that "heads will roll in the streets", which could be merely

a prediction, but rather what specific plan of action, direction

or urging has been made to bring about such event: not the abstract

teaching that Allah will cause the desired

steps taken by specific individual leaders to etrectuate their

but the concrete

goals. It is fully realized that

such evidence is not easily

obtained even if it exists; and finally there seems to be some

indication that the leaders are becoming more cautious in their

utterances.

SUBJECT:

NATION OF ISLAM

INTERNAL SECURITY - NOI

T'ox the past several years, we have been periodically

requesting an opinion from the Department relative to possible

prosecutive action against the Nation of Islam (NOI).

Our latest

In response, the Department has requested

it be supplied with a prosecutive summary report setting forth evidence

the NOI within the past three years has advocated or approved commission

of acts of force and violence

•to deny individuals their constitutional

rights or in seeking to alter the form of government of the United States

by unconstitutional means.

In previous opinions, the Department advised a review of the

activities of the NOI did not constitute violations of any Federal

statutes. In fact, the Department in the past has contended the

language used by NOI officials does not advocate overthron of the

Government by unconstitutional means but seeks to arouse hatred

against the white race as a whole.

The Department requested we

continue to furnish data concerning NOI for future study.

We have.

done this on a continuing basis.

Also, a review of material

we have

furnished the Department does not indicate any change in the teachings

of the NOI toward the overthrow of our Government.

OBSERVATIONS:

Inasmuch as the Department is in possession of all pertinent

Intormation regarding the NOI and its teachings,

it appears the Department

is trying to get the Bureau to do the Department's work.

Furthernore,

the Department has not advised or given any indication it is contemplat-

Ing prosecutive action against the NOI. Therefore, the preparation of

a prosecutive summary report does not appear se

warranted in this

instance. e

Executive Order No. 10450, and asking whether its activities

An examination of the reports and memoranda pertaining

the institution of designation proceedings. The reasons

set forth in our memorandum of September 21, 1960, are

relevant to the present situation.

Because of the radical, semi-secret, and violent nature

of this organization, and the continuing tendency on the part

of some of its leaders to use language of implied threats

CONE IDENTIAL

This is in reply to your memorandum to the Attorney General

dated September 9, 1960, inquiring about the possibility of pro

secutive action against the leaders or designation of the captioned

organization under provisions of Executive Order No. 10450.

The available evidence concerning the activities of the

leaders and members of this organization falls far short of the

requirements sufficient to meet the standards set forth

In the lates decision White the leaders ot the NOT at times te

sort to the use of Virulent and vicious language which would incite

the members to individual acts. of violence against the white race,

it is more calculated and designed to arouse hatred and antipathy

against the white race as a race, rather than against the Governnent.

There is evidence of language which speaks of the destruction of

America, but is couched more in terms of prophecy and prediction,

often referring to the 'war of Armageddon," than in terms of incite-

ment to action. Moreover, the First Anendment would require

something more than language of prophecy and prediction and implied

threats against the Goveriment to establish the existence of a

clear and present danger to the nation and its citizens.

Regarding designation of the NOI pursuant to the provisions

0f Executive Order 10450, it is our opinion

that hate-language em

ployed by the organization's leaders is not probativeof the criteria

of "subversive" nor is it sufficient to establish the NOI to be an

organization ".. • seeking to alter the form of government by

unconstitutional means.' Although there' is substantial evidence of

NOI's advocacy of future violent reprisals-fox alleged wrongs com-

mitted against one or more of its members, the evidence is

insufficient at this time to meet the criterion that it has adopted

a policy of advocating or approving the commission of such acts

of violence to deny others their constitutional rights.

During the past years there has been an exchange of

correspondence between this Bureau and the Department concerning

what legal action, if any, can be taken against this organization

The Department by various memoranda has advised

that a review of this matter has disclosed there is insufficient

evidence to establish a violation of the Smith Act of 1940 or any

other stature of which this Bureau has investigative jurisdiction;

has disclosed the organization appears to have no progran of action

which reasonably would be calculated to bring about or attempt to

bring ahout the violent overthrow of the United States Government;

and has disclosed there is insufticient basis upon which to

proceed against this organization pursuant to the provisions of

Executive Order 10450. The Department from time to time has advised

that it desires that security-type investigations be conducted

concerning the leaders of

the organization and/or its active

participating menbers for consideration for apprchension during

the period of a national emergency and for inclusion in the securiey

Index.

In view of the extreme radical and violent nature of this

organization and its leaders I thought this matter should be called

to your attention in order that you may consider whether there is

any ledal action that can be taken or whether the organization can

be designated pursuant to the provisions of Executive Order 10450.

The NOI is an all-Negro, violently antiwhite fanatical

It has been under investigation for the past several years

to determine if its activities bring it within the purview of

Copies of our investigative reports are furnished the Department

on a continuing basis.

We have closely followed the Department

the fact that

the Department by memorandum August 23, 19535 advised: (1) that

Qu

As you know, it has been the Department's policy

not to designate religious or quasi-religious organi-

On the other hand, the NOI's basic tenets make

this a potentially dangerous

organization in any emergency l'd

for this reason, extensive study and consideration was

given the Bureau reports with a view of determining whether

the NOl falls within the purview of Executive Order No.

10450.

As you have been previously advised, the designation

of NOI poses i number of legal problems.

For example, the

inclusion of NOI under the category that it is an organi

Zation"

.... seeking to alter the form of Government of

the United States by unconstitutional means", has been

determined to be inapplicable inasmuch as the language

used by Elijah Muhammed and his ministers seeks to arouse

hatred and antipathy against the white race as a whole,

rather than seeking to alter the lorm of government, and

any language concerning the destruction of the government

usually has been couched in terms of prophecy or prediction

rather than in terms of incitement to action in the fore -

seeable future.

It has also been determined'that there is insufficient

basis upon which to proceed

against the NOI under any other

criterion of the Order.

organization has failed to disclose the

E evidence

required under the decision in Yates v. United States,!.

354 U.S. 298. It is noted that while the organization,

as such, ostensibly eschews any acts of violence, some.

of the individual leaders and members use language which

could incite to acts of vinlence. To date, however, this

Language has been more calculated to arouse

hatred and

antipathy against the white race as a whole rather than

against the Government, qua government. Any language con-

pard

cerning the destruction of the Government usually has been

couched in terms of prophecy or prediction rather than zn

However, we have noted an

increasing tendency on the part of some of the leaders of

this organization to use language pregnant with overtones

of implied threats against the Government, and we will

continue to carefully examine all material received from

you bearing in mind this tendency.

Any

TATEURY

/ With regard to possible prosecutions under sec-

tions 1001 and 1621 of Title 18, United States Code, we

have reviewed all individual cases coming within the pur-

view of these statutes and, to date, have been unable to

recommend prosecution in any of them for the various

reasons of which you have been apprised in our previous

correspondence in this matter.

Because of the repeated acts of disrespect to-

ward our flag shown by leaders of this organization, we are

considering the desirability of proposed legislation, simi-

lar to Title 4, Section 3 of the United States Code, which

is applicable only to the District of Columbia, to make

criminal acts of desecration or other disrespectful acts di

rected toward our country's flag.

With regard to possible designation proceedings,

certain legal problems created by an action under the appli-

cable critería are under consideration and an analysis is

being made of the more recent reports submitted by the Bureau.

You will be advised concerning this matter as soon as a de

cision has been reached.

provisions of the Smith Act of 1940. The Department

whether its

(E. 0. 10450).

The Department by memorandum from Assistant Attorney General

William F. Tompkins dated 2/7/56, (Bufile 100-356062-1627) advised that

the NoI constituted an organization which should be considered a poten-

instrumentality in the event of a national emergency;

however, upon review of available evidence for use in administrative and

judicial proceedings, it appears that the proof does not warrant either

designation of the organization under E.O. 10450 or institution of pro-

ceedings pursuant to the provisions of the smith Act or 1940. lt was

the Department's decision that designations pursuant to E.O: 10450,

particularly in the case of religious or quasi-religious organizations,

should not be made except upon the basis of evidence which can be

disclosed publicly in proceedings whenever the organization demands a

hearing under the existing rules promulgated by the Attorney General.

The Department requested that the Bureau continue to conduct security

type investigations of the leaders and active participating members of

the organization pursuant to the Security Index Program as well as

investigation of the organization itself.

gate the organization and its members and have furnished the Department

Memo to Mr. Belmont

Re: Nation of Islam

25-330971

on a continuing basis with copies of reports concerning all investiga-

tions.

As of 6/15/59 there were 400 NOI members on the Security

Index.

The Department has recognized that this organization has

dangerous potentiality as it accepts the fact that members of Not

should be on Security Index.

In an emergency through the Emergency

Detention Program the effectiveness and operations of this organization

would be destroyed through the apprehension of its key members.

1/11/56 we presented the facts of this case

to the Department to see if

legal action could be taken, including placing the NOI on the Attorney

General's list of subversive organizations (pursuant to E.0.10450). The

Department replied by memorandum 2/7/56 that the organization does not

warrant designation under E.O. 10450 or consideration under the Smith Act

of 1940. It is noted that we could expect considerable difficulty in

producing witnesses to clearly depict the violent nature of this organi

nation at any administrative hearing because we have gained most of our .

inormation from live Negro informants who would be extremely loathe to

testify publicly because of the inherent physical danger from other members

of the organization and ostricism by other members of

their race.

ACTION:

Despite the above, there is attached for your approval a letter

which raises again with the

Department the question of possible legal

action against the NOI.

Subject: Program for Apprehension and Detention of

Persons Considered Potentially Dangerous to the National Defense and

The review was being conducted with a view toward making a

determination as to whether or not the Muslim Cult of Islam should be

designated by the Attorney General, and also the effect the reported

membership in this organization would have on the consideration of whe-

ther an individual should be listed on the Security Index.

The memorandum to me of March 25, 1957, captioned "Emergency

Détention Program!! enclosed

a copy of an FBI report dated March 12,

1957, at Atlanta captioned "James Alfred Martin, Jr., was" and bore

character "Security Matter--NOI.

The first paragraph of the details

of this report reflects the following: "On January 21 and January 22,

1957, Confidential Informant Atlanta I-l, who has furnished reliable

information in the past, advised that the organization formerly referred

Ito as the 'Muslim Cult of Islam' has been described by ELIJAH MUHAMMAD,

the national leader, as the 'Nation of Islam' and/ox! 'Muhammad's Temples

organization, wherein you requested to be advised whether these

activities constitute a violation of any statute within the juris-

diction of the Bureau.

The Muslim Cult of Islin is ostensibly a religious organ

ization composed exclusively of Negroes.

The principles of

Islam are (1) belief in Allah; (2) belief in the prophets;

(3) belies in the scriptures that the prophets bring; (4) prayer;

(5) charity. The express purpose of the Cult is to clean up the

dark people physically and spiritually so they will be respected

by the other civilized people of the earth.

It desires to elimin

prostitution, gambling and drinking among the dark people so that

they can be respected. It teaches that its members should not

take any part in fighting or anything pertaining to fighting.

Despite this teaching, the leaders have repeatedly advised that

any member who kills four wite. men will be assured of salvation.

According to Elijah pioharmed, the national leader of the Cult,

Allah, taught that all dark people are Asiatics and belong to

Nation of Islam and that the "wicked" (white devils) were to be

destroyed by fire and that the dark people would then have peace

when this source of their trouble was eliminated.

A fundamental tenet of the organization is hatred of the

white man.

Faithiul members are promised that under the leadership

of Allah they will be delivered from the domination of the wnite

man in the War of Armageddon.

tion of the white man and the overthrow of his Goremment.

The organization teaches that"its members owe allegiance

only to Allah and Islam and that any civil law which conflicts:

with

Kuslin law should be disobeyed by the members. It teaches

that dark skinned people cannot be considered citizens of the

United states since they are in slavery in this country. These are

among the reasons given by the leaders why Cult members should not

register for Selective Service or serve in the armed forces.

Each Temple of the organization has a branch known as

the Truit of Islam, composed of the able-bodied male members. The

members of these groups are instructed in close order drill, sell

defense,

eating habits, wearing apparel and the study of regula

tions and doctrines of

the Cult.

In some of the lemples,

which Cult members have been involved.

30 Cult meners was traveling in a day coach en route from Jersey City,

to chicago.

Shortly before arrival in Washington, Do Co, some members

the issuance of a soiled pillow to one of the group. Several members

of the group assaulted the porter, who then broke contact with the

arrived, nine Cult members were arrested and charged with assault and

inciting a riot, and interfering with an officer in the per

Six delendants were tried, convicted, and

sentenced to terms ranging from six months to twenty one months.

Cincinnati, Ohio, Incident.

After engaging in a street

Seven identified themselves as

Cult members and the other two claimed that they were forner members,

but were still firm believers. Two were charged with assault with

intent to kill, by one of the victims, and with assault and battery,

by a policeman who had been struck during the fight.

it was determined that he was making seditions statements to the

recruits, he was removed from the Fost by armed

escort.

The report also contains numerous statements by Elijah

liohammed and the various ministers of the organization. These state

ments appear to advocate the violent overthrow of the Government and

the slaughter of the whité race.

The dominant theme of the utterances

is that all persons who are not members of the cult will be destroyed

in the War of Armageddon, at which time the Goverment will be

There are also

statemenus which approve the acts of violence committed by the

Mau-Mau in Africa and the Puerto Pican Nationalists, and which exhort

Cult members to kill the white devils in order to bring about the

day of their deliverance. It should also be noted that the report

contains other statements by leaders of the organization to the

effect that the deliverance of the Muslims is to be brought about

through a divine act of Allan, who will destroy the "wicked" and

overthrow their government without any assistance from Cult members.

According to this teaching, the role of the membershin of the Cult

in the War of Armageddon will be entirely a passive one.

Although the report is replete with violent statements by

the leadership of the organization and there have been acts of

violence by the individual members, it Isbelzeved that the evidence

The attached memorandum from Assistant Attorney

contained in Department memorandum of 8/23/55 that the names.

and IBI file-numbers of members of the Muslim Cult Of Islam (MCI)

included in the security Index be forwarded to the Depariment

for review for the purpose of determining whether their names

should be retained in the security Inder. The Director asked

"What about this? Haven't we complied with request of

August 23? H."

The Department's request of 8/23/55 was discussed in

my memorandum of : 9/2/55. I recommended that this list not be

furnished the Department pending a decision by the Department

as to whether membership in, active participation in the affairs

thereof, and adherence to the basic tenets of the li constitute

sufficient basis to include an individual's name in the security

Index.

We have been pressing the Department for a decision in

this matter since 8/8/55 and, with the Director's approval, I

personally delivered a memorandum to Mr. Tompkins on 9/9/55

requesting the Department to thoroughly review the organizational

reports on the McI. I informed Mr. Tompkins at that time that,

if the Department arrived at the conclusion that the cult did

not constitute a potentially dangerous instrumentality in the

event of a national emergency and that active participation in

the affairs thereof and adherence to its basic tenets were

insufficient to consider an individual potentially dangerous,

The original of the attached memorandum

dated

September ?,

1955, to Assistant Attorney General T'omphins,

was delivered personally by me on september 8 to dr.

I advised him that in our corespondence with

the Department on the Muslim Cult of Islam, we had the

distinot impression that the depariment hos not thoroughly

reviewed the file and all investigative reports on this

organizationo

I pointed out thai there are approcimotely

150 persons on the security Index who are connected with

this cult and that the question involved is whether the

Department has sufficiently reviewed the file to arrive

at a conclusion as to wether memberahip in a leadership

capacitys

or active capacity in the "Fruit of Islam"

the military section of the cult), should be considered

dangerous in the event of an emergencyo I told uro Tomplins

that if the Department comes to the conclusion such persons

will not be dangerous in an emergency, this Bureau would

imnediately review the cases of the security Index subjects

sor appropriate action ond that in the meantime the individual.

Iist of security Index subjects is not being referred to the

Department for review.

I aquised ir. Tompkins that the memorandum of

September? sets forth several incidents, together with the

background of this organization, mich rejlect the need for

a careju. revie by the Departmento.

Mro Tompkins agreed

and stated that a thorough review would be made and that he

would thereafter communicate with use

This morning (september 9), I received the attached

memorandum from MTo Lomplins,

Instances of violence Against Police Authority

On several occasiong,

the primitive hatred,

with which nenbers are so imbued,

exploded into open

violence.

In June 1950 the Detroit Police, in

attenpting to solve a traffic problem, were assaulted

by a number of Negroes in front of the Temple of Islan

The officers had their night stioks taken away, were

forced to use firearms, and were given a severe beating

by the assenbled negroes.

These Negroes were identified

as members of the bustin CuLt of ISIO

Another incident ocourred in September 1950,

in san Diego, involving two officers of the san Diego

Police Deporinent who were attempting to serve o

trapple warrant.

upon arriving at the address,

Individuals accosted the officers and advised then

the subject of the warrant was not ou home. Then the

officers echibited the warrant ond expressed their

intention of searching the house, they were rushlessly

attacked. This perpetrated a neur rio and necessitated

the calling out of additional cars and approcinately

twenty officers. Before the subject was taken into

cuatody and order was restored, an uninown individual

sired three shots into a police car.

It was later

determined that the subject and the

two individuals

22/20

intercepted the

officers were all members of the

Diego Temple of the Muslim Cult Of ISlan

In February 1953s another incident occurred

which inuolved a disturbance betueen members of the

As result of action taken by the department to remove three

members of the Muslim cult of Islam (MCI),

all Government employees,

from the security Index, we directed a letter to the Department August 8,

1955, requesting advice as to (1) whether we should continue to conduct

security-type investigations of the leaders and active participating

members of the MI and particularly the members of the fruit of Islam (FOI),

the military arm of the cult,

to determine whether the names of such

individuals should be added to the security Index and (2) whether the

names of all members of the McI currently on the security Index should

be removed from the security Index.

With respect to the questions posed to the department, the

Department advised (1) that the bureau should continue to conduct

security-type investigations of the leaders and active participating

members of the MCI and (2) that an individual review and evaluation

of derogatory information reported on each of the leaders and active

participating menbers of the cult must be conducted to ascertain whether

as individuals, they should be removed from the security Index or should

continue to be included, based on substantividevidence of each respective

individual's anarchist and revolutionary activities and beliefs, as

members of the cult. the department further noted that on the basis of

available information the anarchist and revolutionary stotements

reportedly made by a single minister of the cult are not of such scope

Q.3

to indicate an aim or purpose of the cult as enunciated by the prophet.

and leader, Elijah nohanned, for uniform compliance by all McI temple

ministers.

The Department concludes that statements and activities on the

part of individual members of the cult indicating anarchist and revolu

tionary beliefs, will be determining factors in determining whether or not

such individual members come within the revised security Index criteria.

The Department requests that a complete list of the names and FBI file

numbers. of the members of the McI currently included in the security

Index be made available and that the Internal security Division be kept

informed of the individual members' activities on a continuing basis in

order that their cases may be reviewed of re-reviewed in light of any new

evidence or information developed.

Memorandum for u. Boaraman:

Thumbnail Sketch of the UCT:

Reliable informants report that this cult is on organization

composed entirely of Negroes which was reportedly organized around

1930 in Detroit, Michigan. The national leader and founder is

Elijah Mohammed who claims to have been sent by Allah to lead the Negroes

out of slavery in the United states. Members fanatically follow the

alleged teachings of Allah as interpreted by lohammed and disavow

allegiance to the united states. lembers pledged allegiance only to

Allah and Islam and believe any civil law which conflicts with isli

law should be disobeyed. The Cult teaches that members of the dark

skinned race cannot be considered citizens of, the United States since

they are in slavery in this country and, therefore mar of Armageddon"

must free themselves

by destroying non-nuslims and Christianity in the

this purpose the cult has a military branch called the Fruit of Islan

composed of all male able-bodied members who participate in military

drill and

judo training. Members of the cult also believe that they

are airectly related to all Asiatio nations and any conflict involuing

any Asiatic nation and the lestern nationsis considered a part of the

Har of Armageddon in which the Asiatic nation will be victorious.

Instances of Violence Against Police Authority: •

On several occasions the primitive hatred with which nembers

are so imbued, exploded into open violence. In June 1950 the Detroit

Police, in attempting to solve a traffic problem, were assaulted by a

number of Negroes in front of the Temple of Islam. The officers had

their night sticks taken away, were forced to use firearms, and were

given a severe beating by the assembled Negroes. These Negroes were

identified as members of the Muslim Cult of Islam.

Another incident occurred in september 1950 in san Diego,

involving two officers of the san Diego police Department uho were

attempting to serve a traffic warrant. voon arrivingat the address,

two individuals accosted the officers and advised them the subject of the

warrant was not at home. then the officers exhibited the warrant and

expressed their intention of searching the house, they were ruthlessly

attacked.

This perpetrated a nedr riot and necessitated the calling

out of additional cars and approximately twenty officers. Before the

subject was takin into custody and order was restored, an unknown

individual fired three shots into a police car. It was later determined

that the subject and the two individuals who intercepted the officers

were all members of the san Diego Temple of the Muslim Cult of Islamo

Метоталдит дот Нт. Boaraman:

In February, 1951, another incident occurred which involved

a disturbance between members of the cult who were en route to the

yearly convention in chicago.

Members of the Montgomery County Police

in silver spring, Haryland, were alerted. Four policemen who met the

train and entered the car were assaulted and had their guns and

blackjacks taken away from them by members of the cult.

This

necessiated a call for police reinforcements, and nine

members of the

Cult were removed to the station and charged with assault.

Opposition to Federal Authority:

such open dejiance is not relegated merely to local authority.

In view of the stand this organization has taken in connection with

service in the armed forces,

members have consistently,

since the

passage of the selective Iraining and seruice Act of 1910, adhered to the

teachings of their leaders in refusing to register, because they claim

to be registered in the book of allah in the Holy city of Mecca and

cannot serve two masters. In 1942, three leaders of the MCI, including

Elijah nohammed, and seventy members of the Chicago Temple were arrested

by Agents of the Bureau. The charges leveled against the leaders included

followers "that members of the temple of Islam should not go into the

Army and should ignore any cards or letters from the local draft board. "

The indictments returned for sedition and conspiracy to commit sedition

were dismissed in lay, 1913; however, the three leaders served prison

terms for selective service violations. of the seventy members arrested,

approximately forty served prison terms for violation of the selective

Training and service Act of 1940.

During the course of the second world War and the war in Kored,

such incidents were repeated throughout the country, and a number of

convictions were secured for violations of the selective service acts;

now with the threat of hostilities in the far East,

again taken an open stand against service in the armed forces of the

They continue to include in their teachings such

information as:

The black people have always been helping

the devil by fighting in his wars, but the

Muslims do not go to war but rather to jail.

Those who register will be kicked out of

the nation of Islam and will die with the

white devils.

Memorandum for Mr. Boardman:

Disloyalty and Disrespect for the United States Government:

Intertwined with defiance of the provisions of the selective

service acts is the vivid disloyalty to the Government and the continual

disrespect for its laws. such comments as "no good Muslim registers

for the draft, vote or do anything else in the devil's government, " are

repearedly made throughout the various temples. In 1942, Elijah

Mohammed,

the leader of this cult, described the American flag as follows:

"The

flag you see, here is the flag

of the white devil. The white that you

see, and notice that you don't see any black. ony where on it, represents

the white race; the red represents the blood that they lose keeping it for

the white devil alone, the blue background, the white stars represent

the white devils."

When the United states was at war with Japan, the cult considered

the Japanese their "little brown brothers" and gleefully predicted

the victory of the land of the Rising sun. At the outbreak of the war

in Korea, the cult immediately allied its sympathies and spoke in

glowing terms of the strength of their Korean brothers.

They have

consistently referred. to their Asiatic brothers in Russia, and, while

there is no evidence to prove affiliation with the communist party, many

of the leaders have lost no occasion to rise, to the dejense of the

souret Union in any matter involving difficulties between the United

states and Russia.

obseruations:

Based upon an analysis of the rabid teachings of this group..

it

is definitely considered that these people present a threat to the

internal security of the united states, and would, with the right number

of followers and the opportunity, be more than willing to perform any

acts which would subvert American principles and endanger the existence

such a potential threat could materialize

by actual violence against civil authorities prior to a national

emergency as has been done by the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico or

by seizing upon the opportunity presented by a national emergency to

commit aots of violence based upon their hatred and disloyalty to the

Government of the United states.

Our instructions to the field are that

security-type investigations are to be conducted on individual members

of the cult who are reported to be (1) functionaries or leaders of the

Cult; (2) members of the military section of the cult known as the

"Fruit of Islam" or (3) active participants in carrying out fanatical

and disloyal aims and purposes of the cult. Individuals affiliated with

the cult have been retained in the security Inder apter carejul evaluation

of their activities in furthering the violence and anarchist aims and

purposes of the cult under thut portion of the revised security Index

criteria which reads "investigation has developed information that the

individual though not a member or a participant in the activities of

a subversive organization has anarchist or revolutionary beliefs and is

likely to seize upon the opportunity presented by a national

emergency to. endanger the public safety as shown by overt acts or

statements within the last three years established through reliable

sources, informants or indruiduals." As of the current date, we have

151 such individuals included in the security Inder.

Extensive

investigation has been conducted of the activities of the organization

since 1912 and the numerous reports in the matter have been jordarded

to the department.

It appears from the comments contained in the

Department memorandun of August 23, 1955,

that an analysis of the

potential dangerousness of this organization and its members has not

been the subject of a thorough study by the deportment.

The Domestic

Intelligence Division feels that we should cite the information

out previously herein and specifically draw the attention of the

Department to the organizational reports submitted concerning the

Muslim cult of Islam, and request the Department to reconsider its

"stand in this matter. Is the Department has

a: technical legal

Reference la nade to your senorandur dated August 8, 1955, in which

you trished to be advised whether the Bureau should continue do condues

Security-type investigations of the loaders and actira participating mambers

of the Muslim Cult of Islan and its military adjunct, "Fruit of Istan", to

desosmine whother the names of such individuals should be added to the

Security Indess because of their anarchist and ravolutionary activities and

bellels, and further nether the nanes of all individuals the are currently

included in the Securidy Index on a basis of the individual's anarchist and

mrolutionary activities and beliefs as manors of the Muslim Culd of Islam,

should be removedo

For your informiion, the Security Indes status of the three United

Staces Governent Employses, HERBERT CAESAR, JERRAH PUGH and JAMES GRICE.

7aX, soferred to in your memorandun, was considered under all four provisions

'"the revised Critoria, and particularly under Griteria l(e) nich roadss

"Investigation has developad infernation that an individual though not a

anarchist os revolutionary ballela and is likely to seize upon the opportmity

prasented by a national energency to endanger the public saroly as ghou by

overt acus or statements ulthin the last throe yaams established through

instance of the three Unlied States Governont Enployees, that there was

incuificient substantlated evidence adduced with respect to the anarchist

• and

rovolutionery activitles and belleis on the par's of these indiridus subjects,

to warrant the retention of their names in the Sceurity Inder,

It, now appears apparont that due to the unique status of the Muslim Czl*

0f Islam, as an organization, an individual review and evaluation of tha

Your astontion is directed to our memorandun to the Bureau dated

August 10, 1954, captioned "Elijah Mobaned, et a1, Muelin Cult Ialang

Internal Security NCI", in wich it ues stated at that time that tho

fanaticion of Muslin Culs of Islan membera appears to be of such an

extreme degaca as to sender possible an ousbraal of riolence by Cult

members which night be similar in nature to the recontly attempted assass

ination of the reners of the House of Representatives by Puerto Rieatk

Nationalists. It hss been ascertained that the basis for this conclusion

were the aneged revolutionary statenents by Assury Withs, ministar,

including Confidantial Informants lob and Ios of the referoneed sA Lally

Iol is arailable to testify but is know to have furnished false innination

on one oucasion, and advised further that Confidential Informant To5 1e not

available to testily. In addition, the Bureau advised on March 3, 1955,

that Confidential Informant Tol was being changed fron "of known reliabiliay

to "ol unnon reliability".

In this connection, a Bureau report on ASBURY WILLIAMS dated September

I 195l, raflected the rocords of the Federal Correctional Institute st

Milan, Michigan, as follous:

"The subject was described in 1943 as exhibiting

no evidence of major psychological or neuropsychiatris

disorders. A diagnosis of the subject at that time

indicated that he exhibited a constitutional psychopathic

inferiority tith psychosis, His nental deficiency is

noted as "fanilial, border line type.

He was described

as a "constitutional psychopathic state - paranoid

of available intornation, the anchist and revolutionary staterents

reportedly made by ASBURY WILMANS and rsieranced in our August 10ch

memorancy, appear to be resiicted to waits, as a single minister

ol the Cults and a minister uno appears to ba extremely radical, and

such revolutionary statements are 30% or a subatantial scope to indicate

an ain or purpoce of the Cult as enunciated by the prophet and lesderg

ELIJAH KORAINED, for uniforn compliance by all MCI tenple ministers.

You have advised that as vi July 15, 1955, the date of the last

It

is requested that this Division

be furnishod with a complota list of the names and FBI File numbers of the

wembers of the Muslim Cult of Ician curranily included in the Inder.

Considering that sustenents and activities on the part of individual

be determining factors in concluding nether or not such individual

Assistant Attorney General Tompkins' memoranda stated

there was insufficient evidence to consider MCI a basic revolution-

was no evidence that the Cult adheres to the concepts and

principal tenets of the Communist Party (CP) and advocates the

use of force and violence.

As of July 15, 1955, there were 142 Cult members on

Memorandum for Mr. Boardman

Memorandum from Assistant Attorney General Iompkins

captioned "Elijah Mohammed, et al,

Internal Security - MCI," stated in

part

that the MCI continues to foster a program of vicious racial

hatred, fanned continually by the fanatical preaching of

Mohammed and his ministers, bitterly denoucing the United

and proclaiming the

the white people thereof.

He further stated that the fanaticism of the MCI members appears

to be of such an extreme degree as to render possible an out

break of violence by Cult members which might be similar in

nature to the attempted assassination of the members of the

House of Representatives by the Puerto Rican Nationalists.

OBSERVATIONS:

The conclusion reached by Mr. Tompkins in regard to

the three Federal Government employees in regard to the dangerousness

the individuals or the anarchist and violent aims and purposes

of the MCI appears contrary to the observations in his memorandum

of August 10, 1954.

Individuals deemed dangerous because of anarchist

or revolutionary acts or statements have been placed in the

Security Index both under the old Security Index criteria and

the revised criteria,

even though there is no affiliation with

the CP or other Marxist revolutionary groups. The criteria

clearly spelled out this situation.

The radical group of Negroes who are members or the

MCI are lead by Elijah Mohammed.

They believe he is the "True

Prophet of Allah" and believe that any civil law which conflicts

with Muslim Law should be disobeyed. The members disavow

allegiance to the United States and

pledge allegiance only to

Islam.

They do not consider it their duty to register for

Selective Service.

The members consider themselves merely slaves

of this country who will continue to be slaves until they free

themselves. This Cult presents a threat to the internal security

similar to that presented by the Nationalist Party of

Puerto Rico.

Their training, teachings and statements

clearly depict them as potential security threats.

Only

the leaders, members of the

Iruit of Islam and very

active participating members

have been included in the

Security Index.

The three l'ederal employees fall within

these categoriese

ACTION:

Is you approve, there is attached a memorandum

to assistant attorney General Tompkins requesting (1) advice

as to whether the investigations of individual members of

the cult should be continued and (2) wether the names

of the other security Index subjects who have been placed

in the security Index because of their anarchist and

revolutionary beliefs in affiliation with the MCI should

be continued in the security Indexo

CONFIDENIAT

This refers to my memorandum of September &, 1953 wherein V

you were advised that pursuant to your request a r'eview or the

material submitted on the above subject would be made for the

purpose of determining whether prosecution will be authorized and

whether further investigation is desired with regard to the Selective

Service conspiracy thase of this case.

The investigative reports reflect that the Moslem Cult of

Islam is describeu by informants as a vicious and fanatical organis

zation composed of Negroes whose members disavow allogiance to the

Unlied States and declare allegiance only to Islam and Allah's

Prophet, Mijah Moharmed.

The organization's rules imply civil dis

obedience to the laws of the United States while awaiting the annihi

Lation of the White Race in the Biblical reference to the "War of

Armageddon."

In connection with its policy of civil disobedience to

the laws of the United States, several Instances have been reported

where leaders of this Cult have, during the course of meetings, made

statements to the effect that its members should not comply with the

Selective Service Laws and to disregard orders received from their

respective local boards.

This attitude is apparently in line with l6s general

policy of opposition to civil authority and there is no specific

Information developed which would establish that a conspiracy was

formed for the purpose of evading or counseling evasion of service

in the Armed Forces of the United States.

JPIES DESTROYED

35 NOV 23 1962

While there have been instances where individuals have

counseled such evasion, it could not be established that they were

acting as part of a conspiracy and, consequently, prosecution based

on this phase of the case is not warranted.

In the circumstances,

therefore, no specific investigation as to

this possible violation

on the part of the organization is desired at this time. However, 1t

PROGRAMS FOR APPREHENSION AND

DETETION OF PERSONS CONSILERED

POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS TO THE NATIONAL

DEFENSE AND PUBLIC SAFETY OF THE

UNITED STATES

Reference is made to your memorandum of December 30, 1952,

wherein you requested to be advised if the activities of the

captioned organization and its leaders constitute a violation of

the Smith Act of 1940. Your memorandum also requests advice as to

whether security-type investigations should be conducted regarding

the leaders and/or members of the Cult for consideration in connection

with the Security Index.

The file in this case has been reviewed and it is my opinion

that the evidence presently available is insufficient to establish a

violation of

the Smith Act or a conspiracy to violate said Act.

This

conclusion has been reached in spite of the fact that the leaders of

the Cult, in some measure at least, advocate the desirability of the

violent overthrow of the existing Government. However, such advocacy

is expressed more in the nature of a prophecy that such overthrow will

inevitably come about under the leadership of "Allah" in the "war of

Armageddon. " The organization appears to have no program of action

I which reasonably would be calculated to bring about or attempt to

bring about the violent overthrow of the Government.

In addition,

retreiia.

it is pointed out that the conclusion hereinabove expressed is to

a large extent influenced by my opinion that the evidence available

at this time is insufficient to establish such a "clear and present

danger' as is required to make application of the Smith Act consti-

tutional. Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494.

I am, of course, keenly aware that an organization which

subscribes to and breeds on the fanatical beliefs of the Muslim Cult,

and which encourages bitter race prejudice and disloyalty to the

United States would, under certain circumstances, represent a serious

threat to our internal security.

Miss GaNdY.

This is in response to your memorandun of December 28,7757

with its attachment, in which you requested my views as to whether

the facts developed

in the above matter warrant prosecution and also.

to be inforned specifically of the extent of any further investigation

that is desirable.

The facts developed in the investigation to date are insuf-

ficient at this time to prove that men within the draft age have been

actually counseled, aided and abetted by members of the organization'

to evade registration and/or service in the Armed Forces. However,

since the investigative report of November 28, 1951, reveals that

men within the critical age group may have been told by members of

the organization not to comply with the provisions of the Selective

Service Act and to disregard orders received from their respective

local drafi boards, I believe that the investigation should be con-

tinued. In connection therewith I suggest, upon investigation of

CM

subsequent selective service violations by members of this cult, that

the delinquent be interviewed, as in the past, with a view to ascer-

taining whether his delinquency was the result

of being counseled by

a member or members of the organization. If this fact is established,

it is requested that you endeavor to secure the names of those present

at that time, the date of the conversation and its substance in detail.

The information available does not reflect a violation of the

Sedition Statute, 18 U.S.C. 2387, since it does not appear that the

subject group or the members thereof have advised, counseled, urged,

or in any manner caused or attempted to cause insubordination, dis

loyalty, mutiny or refusal of duty by any member of the military or

naval forces of the United States.

(00:JN)

11/22/67

On the morning of 11/22/67 I received a call from

A. I. BCTNICK, Director, Anti-Defanstion League of

B'nal B'rith, 535 Gravier St., Suite 806, New Orleans, Itie

who advised he is currently staying at the Sun & Sand

and was in town to be of whatever assistance he could be ün

the current bombing.

He stated he was going to take those

steps necessary to bring pressure on local authorities

through people in the Jewish business community to insure

that every effort was made to solve this matter. He offered

his and his organization's assistance.

ADDENDUM:

BOTNICK called the afternoon of 11/22/67 to report

that Rabbi NUSSBAUM would have a news conference at his bombed

bouse 4:00 p.w., this date when he would give to the news

media a copy of a paper he had written on Thanksgiving and

bombing. BOTNICK stated also that they had called their

Jewish constituents in Alabama, Miss., Louisiana, Georgia

and South Carolina to call STENNIS and LASTLAND and demand

that they insist that the local authorities in Mississippi

do those things necessary to solve these bombings.

This is a short note to express my deep appreciation for

your taking timeout of what I know to be a busy schedule to see

me. I very much enjoyed our conversation on mutual interests and

concerns. I do hope that on my next visit to Jackson we can have

more time together.

I met with some power structure, sympathetic individuals the

evening of the day I saw you in order to implement your suggestion

in connection with Elmore Greaves. Naturally, there was no indica-

I am sending you under separate cover, with my compliments,

it is a ready reference for any number of groups and organizations

contained in the radical right. Some of them you will see after

examining the index extend deep into Mississippi.

July 21, 1969

Dear Friend :

Recently I was privileged to read an advance copy of a new and exciting book

entitled REPORT ERO ISRAEL, by Arnold Porster, General. Gounsel to the Anti-

Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and Director of ADL's Civil Rights Division.

I had heard so much exciting shop talk about Arnold Forster's new book that I

wanted to read it as soon as possible to know the book and to be able to share with.

you this advance look.

In the summer of 1968 and again in early 1969, Arnold Forster was in Israel

with his tape recorder, and there he produced many first-hand interviews with

pros-

inent Arabs and Jers as

well

as Christians and Moslems.

The book is a narrative

version of these on-the-spot interviews and contains thorough coversage of such

major topics as the aftermath of the Six-Day War, terrorisim on the borders, a

united Jerusalam, the occupied areas, and Christians in Israel.

As I read the book I was caught up by the excitement of the interviews - the in

sights into the Israeli-Arab political picture; the explanation of the Soviet Union''s

Iole in the Middle East by Netanel Lorch, Director of Information of Israel's

Foraign Ministry; interviews with Abba Eban, Israel's Foreign Minister; General Shloro

Cazit, Liaison Officer to General Moshe Dayan; with Mordecai Gazit, Advisor to the

Prime Minister: Ieddy Kollek, Mayor of Jerusalem; Avraham Harmon, President of

Hebrew University; with Aziz Shinadeh, Bethlehem-born Arab lawyer; with Father John:

Roger, head of the Convent of Notre Dame in Jerusalem; Archbishop Bassilius, Chief

Secratary to the Greek Orthodox Patriarch; with Dr. G. Douglas Young, leader of the:

Protestant community in the Old City.

You too will fael the terrorism on the borders when you read

Arnold Forster's

intarview with General Aaron Yaariv, Intelligence Chief of Israal's Armed Forces,

ho was Staîf Chief in the Sinai campaign in 1956, as he describes the Arab

terrorist nachinery.

You will read at first hand what life is like in a settloment where terrorist

activity is a fact of life - at Nahal Golan, a paramilitary settlement located on

a plateau of tha Golan mountain range, within a mile of tha ceasa-fire line between

Israel and Syria.

It Jas

here at Nahal Golan that Arnold Forster made a point to talk with nine-

teen year-oid Anna Fuchs and David Simona. The spirit of these two young people

will capture you, as you rad how they reacted to the terrorist attacks.

In the

words of David Simone: "Here (Nanal Golan) morale is very high. We have a wonderful

life here, and I think wa have the situation under controi."

In presenting a clearer understanding of the new mood among young Blacks,

the discussion includes an explanaiion of their aims and objectives, laud-

ing the emergence of pride in self, race and history.

However, those mili-

tants who seek to establish a separate society outside the framework of the

existing system are labeled "racists in reverse" who pose as a serious

threat to our society as white racists.

Dear Friend:

In view of the urgency of sustaining interest and stimulating community

action based on the findings of the National Advisory Commission on Civil

DisoIders, we are pleased to advise of the avallability of to new and im-

portant films.

The films merit the widest possible audiences and serious

discussion.

REMEDY FOR RIOI

This CBS REPORTS film, based on the Report, examines the 1967 riots in the

framework established by President Johnson when he authorized the commis

sion to find out "....what happened?

Why did it happen?. What can be done

to prevent it from happening again?"

The film explores problems within the ghetto, the role of law enforcemant

agencies, and the mood of white America. REMEDY FOR RIOT explores what

several communities across the country are doing to relieve conditions which

sparked violence.

This unique film, featuring Harry Reasoner, speaks to all sectors of Ameri-

can society. It should be seen by people in private industry to show what

Detroit automotive companies are doing to recruit employees from the ghetto.

Law enforcement personnel can gain from the experiences of Atlanta's Police

Chief, Herbert Jenkins, a member of the National Advisory Commission, who

has worked

for years at improving relations between the police and ghetto

residents.

It is an excellent film which accomplishes a dual purpose: itnot only shows

causes of violence, it also speaks to the cures.

ript. "Two Men For AlI

"Wenkind. '

One was ar Israeli Jew who owns a restaurant in Ial Aviv - you may know.

ci abie isthar through his dangerous flying exploits and most racantly for his

single-handed aid in

supplying food and medical supplies to Biafra, a planeload af

which was donated by 3'nai B'rith in cooperation with the inti-Defamation League.

The other man. = Christian doctor, is Frederick Jean KIoD, who lives today in RoLter

dan with his wife and

two teen-age children. It was DI. KIop who, when the Nazis:

took ovar Holland in 1941, tried to save as many Jews as he could from being rounded:

up and killed.

How best to sun up his book? Let me quote from the introduction by Di.A. Roy:

Eckardt, Chairman of the Department of Religion at Lehigh University, who weites

perceptively:

'When we think of the centuries of human suffering and strife in

coday's world - the Middle East, Biafra, Viatnam - it is all too easy to become

downcast.

But to read Arnold Forster's up-to-date account of his experiences in

Israel is to be given fresh hope - hope for humanity and hope for peace...

"The good thing is that in the very process of introducing us helpfully io

major facets if the life and problems of contemporary Israal, Mr. Forster is also

enabling us to taka heart for the future."

That for me suns up the book. Brief and aasy to read, it is a book of oxtra-

ordinary interest.

In perhaps no other book have such salient statements by leading

Israeli personalities, Jewish

and Christian, been published.

I know you will want to read this book - and to share copies with your friends

in the Jevish and Christian communities. REPORT FROM ISRAEL can be helpful in

countering anti-Semitic Arab propaganda in the United States, to set the record

straight and to tell it like it is - truthfully.

Single copies se this paperback book are available fion our ADi regional office

at $1.25.

Mr. A. I. BOTNIK, Regional Director, Anti-

New Orleans, La., (phone - JA 2-9534), called this

afternoon to report that THOMAS ALBERT TARRANIS, JR.,

father of THOMAS ALBERT TARRANTS, III, called him the

morning of 2/24/70 for an appointment. BOTNIK made out as

though he were someone else and indicated he did not know

TARRANTS. TARRANTS stated he was coming to New Orleans to

see BOTNIK either at work or at his home.

Shortly thereafter BOTNIK notified the New Orleans

police of the call and they said that they, in turn, had

just received a call from TARRANTS, JR., wherein he

explained he probably had upset one of their citizens with

a prior call that date. The New Orleans police, who in

the meantime had contacted the Mobile Police, learned

that TARRANTS was coming to New Orleans and a description

of his automobile. They met him at the city limits, shook

down his car and removed a .30 caliber rifle he said he was

bringing with him. TARRANTS, accompanied by his 15-yeax-old

son, was taken to New Orleans Police Department where.

Mr. BOTNIK contacted him and, to the amazement of all,

all

TARRANTS said was,

"You are the man who set up my son,

to which BOTNIK replied he did not know what TARRANTS

was

talking about.

Essencessity!

a short note to express my deep appreciation for

your taking timeout of what I know to be a busy schedule to see

ne.

I very much enjoyed our conversation on mutual interests and

concerns. I do hope that on my nexi visit to Jackoor In san have

more time together.

I met with some power structure, sympathetic individuals the

evening of the day I saw you in order to implement your suggestion

in connection with Elmore Greaves. Naturally, there was no indica-

tion of my source, and certainly no attribution.

I am sending you under separate cover, with my compliments,

a recent publication of the ADI, that deals with the radical

right.

It isn't the kind of book that one "curls up with," but

it is a ready reference for any number of groups and organizations

contained in the radical right. Some of them you will see after

examining the index extend deep into Mississippi.

Deat Friend:

Recentiy I was privileged to read an advance copy of a new and exciting

entitled REORI FROM ISRAEL, by Arnold Porster, General Counsel to the Anti-

Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and Director of ADL's Givil Rights Division.

I had heard so much exciting shop talk about Arnold Forster's new book that I

wanted to read it as soon as possible to know the book and to be abla to share with.

you this advance look.

In the suamer of 1968

and again in early 1969, Arnold Forster was in Israel

with his tape recorder, and there he produced many first-hand interviews with pron-

inent Aräbs and Jews as well as Christians and Moslens.

The book is a narrative

version of these on-the-spot interviews and contains thorough coversage of such

major topics as the aftermath of the Six-Day War, terrorisim on the borders, a

united Jarusaiar, the scoupied areas, and Christians

in Tarael.

As I read the book I was caught up by the excitement of the interviews - the in

sights into the Israeli-Arab political picture; the explanation of the Soviet Union"

role in zhe Middle East by Netanel Lorch, Director of Information of Israel's

Foreign Ministry; interviews with Abba Eban, Israel's Foreign Minister; General ShIc

Cazit, Liaison Officar to General Moshe Dayan; with Mordecai Gazit, Advisor to the

Prime Minister: Teddy Kollek, Mayor of Jerusalem; Avraham Harmon,

President of

Hebrew University; with Aziz Shihadeh, Bethlehem-born Arab lawyer; with Father John.

Roger, head of the Convent of Notre Dame in Jerusalem; Archbishop Bassilius, Chief

Secratary to the Greek Orthodox Patriarch: with DI. G. Douglas Young, leadar of the:

You too will feel the terrorism on the bordeis when you read Arnold Forster's

interview wich Ganeral Aaron Yaariv, Intelligence Chief of Israal's Armed Forces,

who was Stafe Chiaf in the Sinai campaign in 1956, as he describes the Arab

terrorist sachinery.

You will reed at first'hand what life is like in a settloment whare terrorist

activity is = fact of life - at Nahal Golan, a paramilitary settlement located on

a plateau of the Golan countain lange, within a mile of the cease-fire line between

Israal and Surie.

It was here at laha? Golan that Arnold Forster mada a point to talk with nine-

teen year-oid Anna Fuchs and David Simone.

The spirit of these tve young people

will capture you, as you read how they reacted to the tarrorist nttacks.

words of Daria Sinone:

Dear Friend:

In view of the urgency of sustaining interest and stimulating community

action based on the findings of the National Advisory Commission on Civil

Disorders, we are pleased to

advise of the availability of to new anc in-

portant films.

The films merit the sidest possible audiences aud sericus

discussion.

REMEDY FCR RIOT

This CBS REPORIS film, based on the Report, examines the 1967 riots in the

Eramework established by President Johnson when he authorized the commis-

sion to find out "

....what happened?

Why did it happen?

That can ba done

to prevent it from happening again?"

The film explores problems within the ghetto, the role of law enforcemant

agencies, and the mood of white America. REMEDY FOR RIOT axplores what

several

communitios arross the country are doing to relieve conditions which

sparked violence.

This unique film, featuring Harry Reasoner, speaks to all sectors of Ameri-

can society. It should be seen by people in private industry to show what

Detroit autcuotive companies are doing to recruit employeas from the ghatto.

Law Enforcement parsonnel can gain from the experiences of Atlanta's Police

Chief, Herbert Jenkins, a member of the National Advisory Conmission, who

has worked for years at improving relations between the police and ghetto

residents.

It is an excellent film which accomplishes a dual purpose: itnot only shows

causes of violenca, it also speaks to the cures.

How best to sia up this book?

Let me quote fron the introduction by or. A. Roy

Eckardt, Chairman cs the Department of Religion at Lehigh University, who writes

perceptive:?:

When we think of the centuries of human suffering and strife in

today's word - tha Middla East, Biafra, Viatnam - it is all too easy to becoma

cowncast.

3u: to read Arnold Forster's up-to-date account of his xperiencas in

Istael is to be given frash hope - hope for humanity and hopa for paace...

"The goos thing is that in the vary process of introducing us helpfully to

major facets ee the

life and problems of contemporary Israal, Mr. Forster is also.

enabling us to taka heart for the future."

That

for me sues up the book.

Brief and easy to reac, it is a book of oxtra-

ordinary interest.

New Orleans, La., (phone - JA 2-9534), called this

afternoon to report that THOMAS ALBERT TARRANIS, JR.,

father of THOMAS ALBERT TARRANTS, III, called him the

morning of 2/24/70 for an appointment. BOTNIK made out as

though he wore somone else. and indicated he did not know

TARRANTS.

TARRANT'S stated he was coming to New Orleans to

see BOTNIK either at work or at his home.

Shortly thereafter BOTNIK notified the New Orleans

police of the call and they said that they, in turn, had

just received a call from TARRANTS, JR., wherein he

explained he probably had upset one of their citizens with

₴

prior call that date.

The New Orleans police, who in

the meantime had contacted the Mobile Police, learned

that TARRANTS was coming to New Orleans and a description

of his automobile. They met him at the city limits, shook

down his car and removed a .30 caliber rifle he said he was

bringing with him. TARRANTS, accompanied by his 15-year-old

son, was taken to New Orleans Police Department where.

MI. BOTNIK contacted him and, to the amazement of all,

all

TARRANTS said was, "you are the man who set up my son,

to which BOTNIK replied he did not know what TARRANTS

was

talking about..

BOTNIK stated that TARRANTS was inebriated and

that no conversation of any import took place thereafter,

Dear Friend:

Recentiy I w: privileged to read an advance copy of a new and exciting book

entitled REPORT I .C1 ISRAEL, by Arnold Forster, General. Counsel to the Anti-

Defamation Leagu

of B'nai B'rith and Director Of ADL's Civil Rights Division.

I had heard so much exciting shop talk about Arnold Forster's new book that E

wanted to read it as soon as possible to know the book and to be able to share with.

you this advance look.

In the summer of 1968

and again in early 1969, Arnold Forster was in Israel

with his tape recorder, and there he produced many first-hand interviews with pron-

inent Aräbs and Jews as well as Christians and Moslems. The book is a narrative

version of these on-the-spot interviews and contains thorough coversage of

such

najor topics as the aftermath of the Six-Day War, terrorisim on the borders, a

united Jerusalem, the occunied areas, and christians in Israel.

As I read the book I"was caught up by the excitement of the interviews - the im

sights into the Israeli-Arab political picture; the explanation of the Soviet Union's

role in the Siddle East by Netanal Lorch, Director of Information of Israel's

Foreign Ministry; interviews with Abba Eban, Israal's Foreign Minister; General ShIo

Cazit, Liaison Officer to General Moshe Dayan; with Mordecai Gazit, Advisor to the

Prima Minister: Ieddy Kollek, Mayor of Jerusalem; Avraham Harmon, President of

Hebrew University; with Aziz Shihadeh, Bethlehem-born Arab lawyer; with Father John:

Roger, head of the Convant of Notre Dame in Jerusalem; Archbishop Bassilius, Chief

Secratary to the Greak Orthodox Patriarch: with Dr. G. Douglas Young, leadar of thei

Protestant consunity in the Old City.

You too will feel the terrorism on the borders when you read Arnold Forster's

interview with Ganeral Aaron Yaariv, Intelligence Chief of Israal's Armed Forces,

who was Stais Chief in the Sinai campaign in 1956, as ha describes the Arab

terrorist rachinery.

You will reed at first hand what life is like in a settlement where terrorist

activity is & fact of life - at Nahal Golan, a paramilitary settlement located on

= plateau of the Golen mountain range, within a mile of the cease-fire line between

Israel and Syria.

It was tere at dahal Golan that Arnold Forster made a point to talk with nine-

teen year-oid Anna Fuchs and David Simone. The spirit of these to young people

will caprura you, as you read how they reacted to the terrorist attacks.

In the

words of Darid Sinone: "Here (Nahal Golan) morale is very high. We have a vonderful

life here, and i think we have the situation under controi."

Dear Friend:

In view of the urgency of sustaining interest and stimulating community

action based on the findings of the National Advisory Commission on Civil

Disordets, we are pleased to advise of the availavility of two new and in-

portant films.

The films merit the ridest possible audiences aud serious

discussion.

REYEDY FOR RIOT

This CBS REPORIS film, based on the Report, examines the 1967 riots in the

Erasework established by President Johnson when he authorized the commis-

sion ic find out "

....what happened?

Why did it happen?

That can be done

to prevent it from happening again?"

Tho fi:n explores problems within tie ghetto, the role of law enforcemant

agencies, and the mood of white America. REMEDY FOR RIOT explores what

-'aral communities across the country are aning to relieve conditions which

spiried violence.

This unique film, featuring Harry Reasoner, sgeaks to all sectors of Emerí-

can societs. It should be seen by people in private industry to show that

De:toit autoootive companies are doing to recruit employees frou the gietto.

Law enforcement personnel can gain from the experiences of Atlanta's Police

Chief, Herbert Jenkins, a member of the National Advisory Conmission, tho

has sorked for years at improving relations between the police and ghetto

residents.

It is an excellent film which accomplishes a dual purpose: itnot only shows

causes of violence, it also speaks to the cures.

Che was an Israali Jew who owns a restaurant in lal iviv - you may krow

of abie char through his dangerous flying axploits and most racently for his

singla-handed aid in supplying food and medical supplies to Biafra, a planaload of:

which was dorated by 3'nai B'rith in cooperation wich the Anti-Datanation Idague.

The othes man. a Christian doctor, is Frederick Jaan Krop, who lives today in norcer-

and two teen-age children. It was Dr. Krop who, when the Nazis

from being rounded

How best to sun ip his book? Let me quota fron the introduction by Dr. A. Roy

Eckardt, Chai-zan cs the Department of Religion at Lehigh Univarsity, who writes

• perceptively:

"When we think of the centuries of human suffering and strife in

today's world - the Middla East, Biafra, Viatnam - it is all too aasy to become

downcast.

3u: to read arnold Forster's up-to-data account of his expariences

in

Israel

is to be given frash hope - hope for humanity and hopa for paace...

"The goos thing is that in the very process of introducing us helpfully to

major facets if the life and problems of

contemporary Israal, Mr. Forster is also

enabling us to taka heart for the future."

Thay for me suns up the book. Brief and easy to read, it is a book of extra-

J=3irary

interest.

In parhaps no other book have such saliant statements by leading

Israeli personalities, Jewish and Christian, been published.

I snow you will want to road this book - and to share copies with your friards

BOINIK also stated that one J. S. HARRIS, 3022

TARRANTS stated he was coming to New Orleans to

see BOTNIK either at work or at his home.

Shortly thereafter BOTNIK notified the New Orleans

just received a call from TARRANTS, JR., wherein he

explained he probably had upset one of

their citizens with

priox call that date.

The New Orleans police, who in

the meantime had contacted the Mobile Police, learned

that TARRANTS was coming to New Orleans and a description

of his automobile. They met him at the city limits, shook

down

his car and removed a .30 caliber rifle he said he was

COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN RACIAL MATTERS

Zappet

INTERNAL SECURITY - COMMUNIST

This memorandum recommends a letter to all offices directing

the tield to broaden its efforts relating to communist influences in

the racial field so that the Bureau will be better able to keep pace

with the stepped-up efforts of the communists to penetrate and influ-

ence the racial movement. We are also directing the opening of a new

case file, both at the Seat

of Government and in the field, which will

serve as a repository for all intelligence relating to this matter anc

provide for the submission of quarterly investigative reports to the

Bureau. Heretofore, this intelligence was included in the quarterly

reports submitted concerning the Communist Party, USA, and in reports

covering various of the allied groups and individuals

active in the

racial movement.

Coincident with the increased racial activities occurring

the Communist Party, USA,

has resulted in greater investigative effort on our part in the

security

field. We have been regularly gathering extensive data depicting in

many ways the communist influence and participation in the racial move

ment.

We must, however, increase these efforts to keep ahead of the

communists' plans to infiltrate the racial picture.

Our proposed

instructions to the field are directed toward a broadening of our pro-:

cedures which in turn will more fully and precisely provide us with

the facts relating to the extent of communist influence.

RECOMMENDATION:

some

dire

In line with the above, there is attached for approval a

proposed letter to all offices,

original on Plastiplate.

Arter

approval, return to Room 808 RB for preparation of the necessarj

copies to send to the field. The necessary Manual changes will be

submitted separately.

The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend that

attached letter be sent to the field discontinuing the submission of

a separate report on captioned matter and instructing that the matter

be reported in the reports on the subversive group exerting such

influence.

MH 55179

Prior to 1964 this subject matter was reported in a section

of the Communist Party, USA report or in the report of any other

subversive group, such

the Socialist Workers Party, which was

attempting to exert influence in racial matters. In 1964 a separate

investigation and report were initiated because of an increase in

communist attempt's to influence the racial movement as the tempo of

activities in the racial field increased. The field was instructed

to submit separate quarterly reports containing all attempts by any

communist group to influence the racial movement under the code

word "CIRM."

EX-1031

100-442524-3226

This communist influence has been decreasing and in the

first quarter of 1973 only 16 offices submitted reports in this

matter, the other offices submitting letters as no pertinent infor-

mation was developed. In line with our continuing efforts to relieve

the field of unnecessary reporting requirements in order tu make more

time available for investigation and informant development, a change

ADMINISTRATIVE MATTER

I propose, in view of the heavy vorkload caused by our

"Ваш б

anvestication of the connunist intluence into the racial movement

and the importance of this problem to the Bureau, to assign two

supervisors exclusively to the handling of our investigations into

these matters.

To accomplish this, it will be necessary to realign

some of our other work and for a temporary period to have one

additional Special Agent supervisor assigned to the Internal Security

Section.

BACKGROUND:

About three months prior to the March on Washington

(8-28-63), we intensified our investigation concerning the communist

influence into the racial movement in order to develop as completely

as

possible all information concerning connunist exploitaiion and

penetration into the racial picture.

The coverage ve are affording

the specific activity of the

USA (CPUSA), but also the collateral efforts oi the

Party to penetrate noncommunist racial groups such as the southeri

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), Congress of Racial Equality

(CORE), Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNICK) and the

National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP),

to name a few.

The concentrated effort of the field has produced a heavy

volume of mail. When this mail reaches the Bureau, it is essential

that it be carefully analyzed in order that the over-all picture of

what the Party

is doing in the racial movement can be accurately

projected. This is a time-consuming task which requires the close

attention of experienced and knowledgeable personnel.

X3R0E

Every indicator points to the fact that racial dis~

Liurbances will probably reach their peak during the coming summer.

The Party's activity in its efforts to gain control of the racial

movement will also reach a corresponding high peak this summer.

It is not possible to absorb these cases in other Units

We cannot foresee at this time for how long a period of

time it will be necessary for us to have two supervisors assigned

to get a man from the Washington

ADDENDUM BY INSPECTION DIVISION

'ESMI: bhg

6/4/64

The Internal Security Section, Domestic Intelligence Division (DID), has

requested one additional supervisor to be assigned to that Section on a temporary basis

to handle case assignments vacated by two experienced supervisors whom DID desires

to devote full time to directing field efforts, correlating results, and preparing for

dissemination investigative information obtained resulting from strongly implied Com-

munist Party (CP) effo' 's to infiltrate and dominate noncommunist racial groups' efforts

in the Summer of 1964

o whip the racial situation to a peak period of disturbances.

Urgency for the FBIt "stay ahead'' of the situation is tied to pending civil rights

legislation and fores able ramifications arising out of the complex political situations

in an election year w. ›re civil rights and social disturbances will play a key role in

campaign efforts and ossibly election results.

The assigning of full-time personnel to the proposed correlation assignments

is considered to be established by recent occurrences not set out by DID in its request

and which tend to validate observations that the CP is eager to capitalize on, and control

if it can, the efforts of racial groups. (1) Demonstration at World's Fair opening, Apri

1964, resulted in a number of arrests and there was a definite indication of communist

participation as well as direction of demonstrations. (2) On 5/18/64 New York State

was the scene of state-wide demonstrations against school segregation. Communists

participated and in other ways were involved. (3) Plans are underway for some form

of small size march on Washington 6/15/64 relative to civil rights legislation presently

being debated in the Senate. Communists are involved in this planned activity. (4)

During the last two weeks St. Augustine, Florida, has been the scene of a number of

racial demonstrations. Martin Luther King, Jr., an individual of extreme importance

to the Bureau from an investigative standpoint has rented a cottage in this area for three

months where it is anticipated he will become involved in long-range plans to demon-

strate in that area. (5) Cambridge, Maryland, for some time the seat of numerous

demonstrations, is of interest because of the influence in these demonstrations of one

of the party's national committee members. (6) There is some indication of a large

civil rights rally to be held in Chicago some time in June, 1964, where communist

influence and participation are expected. (7) Martin Luther King and others have been

recruiting college students from various parts of the country to participate in a mass

voter registration project in the State of Mississippi. The usual communist elements

are expected to be involved. (8) Plans are already underway for some racial activity

to take place in commemoration of the 8/28/63 march on Washington and information

has been received indicating a nationwide work stoppage will be made. The above are

a sampling of the CP's interest in the race movement.

The above are among the considerations which the two agents assigned to

the special program would have to follow, correlate and disseminate, if necessary.

In addition to following and analyzing the flow of information already coming from the

field, in anticipation of the need to more clearly definethe extent of CP influence in

the racial movement, DID recently issued instructions to the field to direct the field's

attention to this area of thinking and contemplates additional follow-up instructions in

the near future.

HH 55179 Do0Id:32989648 Page 286

---

## Page 287

The two Agents designated to hindle the special assignment have substantial

case loads at this time and would contint to handle some of the same cases they are

now supervising because of their pertineuce to the proposed assignment; however, as

of 6/2/64, 78 cases of one supervisor and 69 (total 147) of the other would have to be

reassigned to other supervisors in the Internal Security Section for handling if the two

Agents were assigned full time to the proposed project. Recent figures (5/20/64)

indicate the Internal Security Section had 19 Special Agents assigned to supervise 3293

cases. As of January, 1964, this section had 2928 cases and 22 supervisors or an

increase of 365 cases : 1d a decrease of 3 supervisors. The overtime of the Internal

Security Section has k en consistent with the Division's overtime for two months and

above the Division's pertime three of the last five months for which figures are avail-

able.

In all instance,, the overtime has been substantially above two hours. In

addition, since 1/2/ 1, the Internal Security Section has had a total of 279 items or an

average of 12. 6 iter per week delinquent which it estimates would take approximately

19 additional hours per week to clear, implying that the present staff is not excessive.

CONCLUSIONS

The Internal Security Section of DID in recognition of the need

for concentrated attention being given to the strongly implied CP

interest in the racial situation has proposed assigning on a temporary basis two of its

experienced supervisors to the direction and correlation of a program designed to give

closer seritiny to developments arising out of communist interest in racial groups.

To accomplish this, that Section has requested the assignment of one Agent supervisor

whu will handle à portion ui appiusimately 147 cases nün supervised vy inù Agenio .

and would be left unassigned after the assignments of the two men to the special project

Surplus assignments over and above those which one Agent could handle would be parcel

out among other supervisors in the Section. The implied necessity for the next few

months of special attention being given to CP interests in and ambitions to control the

race picture is recognizable to the Inspection Division and other data obtained in survey

ing the DID request for one man on a temporary basis appears to be supported by case

load, overtime, delinquency, and the nature of the cases supervised. The placement

of a Washington Field Office Agent in this assignment as suggested by DID would, of

rees that this stating cos de cations ot sement to biat teresent time.

The Inspection Di

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. That one Special Agent be assigned to the Internal Security

Section, Domestic Intelligence Division, on temporary

basis. If approved, should be handled by Mr. Mohr's Office.

2. That this situation be re-evaluated 10/1/64 in view of the

request for temporary assistance. The above date is compatible with Domestic

Intelligence Division and should allow sufficient time for an accurate assessment

of the validity of the program involved. If approved, Domestic Intelligence Division

should submit memorandum 10/1/64 evaluating program and making appropriate

recommendations regarding assignment or reassignment of temporary supervisor.

Urgency for the FBI to "stay ahead" of the situation is tied to pending civil rights

legislation and foreseeable ramifications arising out of the complex political situations

in an election year where civil rights and social disturbances will play a key role in

campaign efforts and possibly election results.

The assigning of full-time personnel to the proposed correlation assignments

is considered to be established by recent occurrences not set out by DID in its request

and which tend to validate observations that the CP is eager to capitalize on, and control

if it can, the efforts of racial groups. (1) Demonstration at World's Fair opening, April,

1964, resulted in a number of arrests and there was a definite indication of communist.

participation as well as direction of demonstrations. (2) On 5/18/64 New York State

was the scene of state-wide demonstrations against school segregation. Communists

participated and in other ways were involved. (3) Plans are underway for some form

of small size march on Washington 6/15/64 relative to civil rights legislation presently

being debated in the Senate. Communists are involved in this planned activity. (4)

During the last two weeks St. Augustine, Florida, has been the scene of a number of

racial demonstrations. Martin Luther King, JI., an individual of extreme importance

to the Bureau from an investigative standpoint has rented a cottage in this area for three

months where it is anticipated he will become involved in long-range plans to demon-

strate in that area. (5) Cambridge, Maryland, for some time the seat of numerous

demonstrations, is of interest because of the influence in these demonstrations of one

of the party's national committee members. (6) There is some indication of a large

civil rights rally to be held in Chicago some time in June, 1964, where communist

influence and participation are expected. (7) Martin Luther King and others have been

recruiting college students from various parts of the country to participate in a mass

voter registration project in the State of Mississippi. The usual communist elements

are expected to be involved. (8) Plans are already underway for some racial activity

to take place in commemoration of the 8/28/63 march on Washington and information

has been received indicating a nationwide work stoppage will be made. The above are

a sampling of the CP's interest in the race movement.

The above are among the considerations which the two agents assigned to

the special program would have to follow, correlate and disseminate, if necessary.

In addition to following and analyzing the flow of information already coming from the

field, in anticipation of the need to more clearly definethe extent of CP influence in

the racial movement, DID recently issued instructions to the field to direct the field's

attention to this area of thinking and contemplates additional follow-up instructions in

the near future.

## Page 293

The two Agents designated to handle the special assignment have substantial

case loads at this time and would continue to handle some of the same cases they are

now supervising because of their pertinence to the proposed assignment; however, as

of 6/2/64, 78 cases of one supervisor and 69 (total 147) of the other would have to be

reassigned to other supervisors in the Internal Security Section for handling if the two

Agents were assigned full time to the proposed project. Recent figures (5/20/64)

indicate the Internal Security Section had 19 Special Agents assigned to supervise 3293

cases. As of January, 1964, this section had 2928 cases and 22 supervisors or an

increase of 365 cases and a decrease of 3 supervisors. The overtime of the Internal

Security Section has been consistent with the Division's overtime for two months and

above the Division's overtime three of the last five months for which figures are avail-

able. In all instances, the overtime has been substantially above two hours. In

addition, since 1/2/64, the Internal Security Section has had a total of 279 items or an

average of 12. 6 items per week delinquent which it estimates would take approximately

19 additional hours per week to clear, implying that the present staff is not excessive.

CONCLUSIONS

The Internal Security Section of DID in recognition of the need

for concentrated attention being given to the strongly implied CP

interest in the racial situation has proposed assigning on a temporary basis two of its

experienced supervisors to the direction and correlation of a program designed to give

closer scrutiny to developments arising out of communist interest in racial groups.

To accomplish this, that Section has requested the assignment of one Agent supervisor

who will handle a portion of approximately 147 cases now supervised by two Agents

and would be left unassigned after the assignments of the two men to the special project.

Surplus assignments over and above those which one Agent could handle would be parcell:

out among other supervisors in the Section. The implied necessity for the next few

months of special attention being given to CP interests in and ambitions to control the

race picture is recognizable to the Inspection Division and other data obtained in survey

Washington Field Office Agent in this assignment as suggested by DID would, of

es that tie one cation destinet to this wi

writ the present time.

The Inspection Div.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. That one Special Agent be assigned to the Internal Security

Section, Domestic Intelligence Division, on temporary

basis. If approved, should be handled by Mr. Mohr's Office.

2. That this situation be re-evaluated 10/1/64 in view of the

request for temporary assistance. The above date is compatible with Domestic

Intelligence Division and should allow sufficient time for an accurate assessment

of the validity of the program involved. If approved, Domestic Intelligence Division

should submit memorandum 10/1/64 evaluating program and making appropriate

recommendations regarding assignment or reassignment of temporary supervisor.

SYNOPSIS •

In cune, tubs, a new special desk was

created in the Internal

Security Section,

Domestic Intelligence Division; as a result of my

memorandum to you '5/20/64, to concentrate on the investigation into

the communist influence in racial matters. This investigation was to

be handled by two Supervisors, one being separated from the Communist

Party Unit and one from the Communist Front Unit. To assimilate the

other work being left by those Supervisors; it was necessary to obtain

an additional Supervisor. This matter was

looked into by the Inspection

Division which recommended, and it was approved, that an additional

The Communist Front Unit, where the temporary Supervisor IS

assigned,

has also shown an increase in its case load. The "temporary"

nature of the situation is now believed to be "permanent."

OBSERVATIONS:

The necessity for the temporary Supervisor whom we obtained

1964; is more than ever present. Our work load in the

I communist influence in racial matters which generated the necessity

for a temporary Supervisor has been steadily increasing, with no sign

of a letup; the work in the Communist Front Unit where the temporary

It was recommended, and approved, that ino Supervisors be separated

newly created special Desk to concentzate on the investigation into

the comunist influence in racial matters.

It was requested that the additional super-

Current Situation

The necessity for our intensification of investigation of the

communist influence in racial matters has not abated; rather, it has

Increased. We have been handling a high volume of priority wor in

this area dealing with such major projects as the racial disorders and

demonstrations in New York City and the Mississippt Sumer Project

(MSP) •

There have also been racial disturbances in Philadelphia,

Pennsylvania; Rochester, New jock; and New versey, alt leguiring

Investigative efiort relative to possible subversIve anIluences.

The MSP work was originally handled in the Coumnist Influence in

Racial Matters (CIRM) Unit only as respects subversive ramifications.

Horever, with the transfer of certain of the Civil Rights Section work

Irom the General Investigative Division to the Domestic Intelligence

Division, we now have absorbed all aspects of the MSP ix the CIRit Unit.

This is presently taking the full time of one Supervisor, in addition

to a full-time clerical employee.

In this regard, it should be noted

that thereas we originally started this special lait with two Super-

risors, ve now have three. When the new Unit as created. there were

assigned to it approximately 120 cases.

As of 10/1/64, this figure

has increased to 134 cases.

All indicators point to a contimed heavy

work load relative to the communist influence in racial matters. This

has become a big factor relative to the forthcoming national elections

and, in addition, there are definite indications that the MSP will

a continuing thing. There have also been some indications that activ-

ities such as the MSP will extend into other states.

In addition,

under date of 8/28/64, a letter was submitted to all offices instruct-

ing a broadening of our investigation into the communist influence in

racial matters and the setting up of a new and more intensified report-

ing procedure. Due 11/1/64 are comprehensive investigative reports

from all field offices which will provide centralized reporting on this

matter.

The Conmunist Front Unit, which is where the temporary Super-

visor is assigned, has also shown an increase in its case load. As of

Court decisions favorable to the Party under various facets of the

Internal Security Act of 1950 have breathed new life into the Party.

The Party is now taking bolder steps to carry on its work in mass

organizations, as well as creating new front organizations.

One case

in point is that dealing with the W. E. B. DuBois Clubs of America,

Inc., the new national Party youth organization. The formation of

this youth group was finalized at a National Convention in June, 1964,

which was held in San Francisco, California, and was attended by

approximately 450 youths.

Since that time several affiliates of this

group have come into existence.

One of the plans for action decided

upon by the group was to have affiliates of the group formed on college

campuses throughout the United States; therefore, it can be expected

that in the immediate future after these various youths have returned

to their college campuses, they will form such campus groups. This

will represent not only an increase in case load, but will also

increase the work of the field in penetrating and following the

activities of such groups.

This will call for close supervision of

these groups due to the nature of the make-up of the clubs and the

fact that they are located on college campuses in order to avoid any

embarrassment to the Bureau. It is also anticipated that with the

advent of the fall and winter seasons, the Party will step up its

i ach the Party el save a storest.

Re: SUPERVISOR RICHARD F. BATES

Supervisor in Charge of the Communist Influence in Racial

ADDENDUM: (EWW:ers 12/7/65)

-

A review of the personnel file of SA Richard F. Bates reveals no reason

why he should not be approved as Supervisor in Charge of the Communist

Influence in Racial Matters Unit of Internal Security Section, as recommended

by Domestic Intelligence Division. Bates has never been the subject of

disciplinary action more severe than censure. Prior to his transfer to the

Bureau he served as Supervisor of a Security Matter - C squad in the New York

Office for three years. He appears to be completely knowledgeable as to all

aspects of the Bureau's investigations of security matters, rated excellent

on the last annual performance rating. Weight and overtime satisfactory.

Accordingly, it is recommended that Supervisor Richard F. Bates be

approved as Supervisor in Charge of the Communist Influence in Racial Matters

Unit, Internal Security Section, Domestic Intelligence Division,

located and available information regarding them must be

reported.

(4) Continued consideration must be given by

each office to develop means to neutralize the effectiveness

of each KBE.

Any counterintelligence proposal must be approved

by the bureau prior to implementation.

(5) Obtain suitable handwriting specimens of each

KBE to be placed in the National Security File in the

Laboratory. When possible, obtain specimens from public

records, law enforcement agencies, and similar sources.

which may subsequently become subject to criminal proceedings.

Promptly record all such information in interview report form.

Where there appears to be a possible violation

of a statute within the investigative jurisdiction of the

Bureau, the substantive violation character should be included

If no investigative summary report has been submitted

in each case, such a report must be submitted to the Bureau by

Thereafter, an investigative report should be sub-

mitted at least every 90 days. Furthermore, appropriate

communications suitable for dissemination should be promptly

submitted in the interim to keep the Bureau fully advised of

RACTAT MATTERS

To recommend that the attached airtel be sent to all

offices setting up a Key Black Extremist (UKBEY program to intensify

jour coverage on certain black extremists.

Because of the violence potential of all black extremists,

we have required that the field give priority attention to the

investigations of all black extremists. The information submitted

'by the field indicates that there is a need for intensified coverage

on a group of black extremists who are either key leaders or

activists and are particularly extreme, agitative, anti-Government,

and vocal in their calls

for

terrorism

and violence.

Leaders of

the violence-prone Black Panther Party have indicated that the

"revolution" is entering the beginning phases of actual armed

struggle and our investigations indicate them are certain extremists

more likely to resort to or to order terrorism as a tactic and

therefore require particular attention.

Intensified coverage to bring to bear the total capabil-

ities of the Bureau on investigations öf these individuals is

warranted.

the directivenes i sach catte inances

future plans,

and possible violation of Federal and local law of these individuals

should receive the closest investigative and supervisory attention.

Following the receipt of

an investigative summary report,

reports on these individuals should be submitted every 90 days,

with interim letterhead memoranda, in order that our intensified

coverage can be better followed and dissemination made on a timely

basis. About I cases are involved in this intensified coverage:

Re: Key Black Extremist Program

Inasmuch as KBE individuals are of the type who would be

subject to maximum investigative attention and close supervision,

the administration and supervision of this program entails only a

minimum amount of time above that which would normally be

expended on these cases.

The continuing revolutionary activities of the individuals

sentate as eat close investigative ad supervisory

reevaluated in December, 1972.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the KBE program be continued.

Purpose of this memorandum is to justify revision of

the Key Black Extremist (KBE) program to include nonblack extremist

subjects and redesignate it as the Key Extremist (KE) program.

The KBE program was initiated 12/23/70 to intensify

investigative coverage of selected black extremists throughout the

United States who were extremely active and posed the greatest

potential for revolutionary activity. The program's objective was

to develop complete and detailed information on their day-to-day

activities and future plans.

It is recommended this KBE concept be revised into a KE

program, which would encompass the activities of all extremist /

matters subjects, black, white-hate Klan-type, and American Indian.

The program will

focus on individuals whose activities warrant

intensive investigative attention.

Individuals designated KEs will be considered for

the ADEX; a biographical sketch with photograph will be included in

the Extremist Photograph Album; all aspects of their finances will

be determined; handwriting specimens will be placed in the National

Security File in the Laboratory Division; fingerprints will be

included in the Identification Division's Single Fingerprint File;

possible criminal violations will be vigorously pursued; emphasis

will be placed on obtaining records of inflammatory statements;

Federal income tax returns will be reviewed where warranted;

particular attention will be paid to their travel; and high-level

informant

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re: Key Extremist Program

The KBE program proved to be a successful vehicle to

insure constant and uniform investigation of such individuals by

the field and the KE concept should do likewise.

Appropriate Manual changes will be made. This program

will be reviewed in December, 1973.

RECOMMENDATION:

1. That the existing KBE program be revised to include

individuals involved in white-hate Klan-type and American Indian

extremist activity and redesignated the KE program.

2. That the attached airtel containing instructions in line

with the above be sent to all offices.

A preliminary analysis of the Key Extremist Program (KEP)

by FBIIQ, including discussions with supervisory and investigative

personnel who have been attending special Extremist Matters In-

Service classes, indicates that constant investigative attention is

not always being afforded individuals who have been designated as

Key Extremists.

All offices are reminded that KEP was instituted in

1970 as the Key Black Extremist Program to provide guidelines for

Intensive investigation of certain black extremist leaders and

activists whose endorsement and/or involvement in revolutionary and

terrorist activity warranted priority attention. In January, 1973,

the program was redesignated KEP and revised to include key white-hate

Klan-type extremists and American Indian extremists in addition to

black extremists. There are approximately 90 individuals throughout

the country currently designated as Key Extremists in some 27 field

offices.

Specific instructions as to the nature and extent of

Marual of instructions, Section 122 A, Item 3, Pagea and 6, and

investigation to be conducted on Key Extremists are

Wall supervisory and investigative personnel handling extremist natters

should be specifically reminded of the requirements set forth therein.

Re: Key Extremist Program

In order to make a thorough overall analysis and

reevaluation of the KEP at FBIHQ and to assist each office in

analyzing the effectiveness of its own program, the following survey

is to be conducted:

I.

Lach office is to examine pending cases on individual

extremists (black, white-hate Klan-type, and American Indian) within

Its territory to insure all who warrant designation as a Key Ixtremist

are so designated and those individuals currently designated as Key

Extremists varrant retention as same. By airtel to reach the Bureau

by 7/2/73 under the caption. "Key Excremist Program,

DiVision,

Extremist Matters," advise the Bureau that this survey has been

completed and identity appropriate individual extremists by name,

character, Bureau and field file numbers under the following seli-

explanatory captions:

A, "Individuals Currently Designated Key Extremists"

B. "Individuals Designated Key Extremists Iho No Longer

Warrant Retention as a Key Extremist"

C. "Individuals Who Warrant Designation as a Key Extremist"

If the answer under any one of the three captions is "None," so

state.

II. Those offices with individual extremists listed under

above captions' B and C, submit by the same date in airtel forn

under the individual's case castion your recommendation for inclusion

or deletion of that individual Iron the Kir. Full justification

should be set out and Bureau will act on your recommendation.

III.

Those offices with current individual Key Ixtremists

(caption A above) submit by the same date in airtel form under

the individual case cantion the answer to the following questions,

by number, relative to that individual:

I. Is the subject included on the ADIX? If not, and

recommendation to include or to delete from the old ADEX

criteria has not yet been submitted, submit your recomnendation

to include or delete promptly wich full justification in accon

'ance with current instructions. If a recommendation has been

submitted and the individual has not been included or has been

deleted, so state.

2. Is the subject included in the Extremist Photogrash

Album? If not, immediately submit Form FD-432 for inclusion

therein.

3. Outline the nature of the coverage you have of subject's

finances, specifically indicating if bank accounts are or are

not being monitored.

If bank accounts are not being monitored,

give reasons therefor.

4. If warranted, has the Bureau been specifically

requested to obtain subject's tax returns? If not, give your

reasons for not considering this investigative step.

5.

Have you developed or placed an informant close to

the subject?

If so, identify such informant(s) by symbol

9. Has a full. and thorough background investigation

been completed on the subject?

If the answers to questions number 5 through 9 above are

in the negative, outline in another paragraph immediately under the

answer the specific steps underway or being instituted by your

office to fulfill this investigative requirement.

Some confusion regarding Key Extremists has arisen over

the new ADEX criteria outlined in Memorandum to All SACs 21-72 dated

9/12/72. This revised criteria make it possible to have an extremist

who warrants designation as a Key Extremist and yet does not meet the

new criteria for inclusion on the ADEX. Such individuals may continue

to be designated as Key Extremists.

-

Additional confusion has also arisen over reporting require-

ments which were relaxed by above-mentioned Memorandum to All SACs.

Hereafter, individuals designated as Key Extremists are to be considered

as exceptions to the above memorandum under Item 4d, Page 8, and reports

on Key Extremists are to be regularly submitted every 90 days. If no

report has been submitted on a Key Extremist within the past 90 days,

promptly prepare and submit an up-to-date report and submit follow-up

reports thereafter on a 90-day basis.

Section 122 of the Manual of Instructions is being revised

to outline more clearly the criteria for designating black, white-hate

Klan-type, and American Indian extremists as Key Extremists as well as

the ADEX status of and reporting procedures for Key. Extremists.

All offices insure in the future that hew cases on individual

extremists are carefully scrutinized to see if they warrant designation

as a Key Extremist, and that an appropriate recommendation is promotly

submitted to the Bureau.

no longer warrant designation as such, the identity of individual

extremists who should be designated Key Extremists, and to deter-

mine if required investigative steps are being followed with respect

to those individuals designated as Key Extremists.

Originally, all Key Extremists were to be included in the

ADEX. Recent changes in ADEX criteria require an individual included

therein to be dangerous now to national security and some confusion

has resulted in the field over whether or not Key Extremists must be

removed as Key Extremists if they do not qualify for Ades. The field

to recent relaxation of reporting rules. Original instructions

required reports on Key Extremists every 90 days and this is being

We currently have throughout the United States a total of

field offices. The New York Office has 19 and the San Francisco

Office has 16. The number of Key Extremists in the remaining 25

The Program indicates a current decline in these

and expanded in January, 1973, to include nonblack extremists.

As a result of streamlining our investigative

procedures, this Program is being discontinued. The Key

Extremist character is to be dropped from all future

This in no way means a deemphasis of our

investigation of individuals who were formerly carried as

Key Extremists.

In view of increasing problems with which we

faced in the overall racial field, particularly in the

black nationalist elements, we have carefully analyzed our dad P

development of racial intelligence concerning militant

informant program to place proper emphasis where needed.

Although we are making progress in developing racial sources

in the ghettos, we feel we can do much more and must do so

rapidly in the

coming six months to be prepared for another

potential summer of violence. Proposed SAC letter attached.

To accomplish our objective of thorough penetration

of the ghettos with a network of quality sources under a

crash program, the following procedures will be instituted to

carry out this program.

The individuals we will be con-

tacting under this crash informant program will be living in

the ghettos; therefore, in the absence of any derogatory in

formation developed, background investigation should consist

of a check of field office indices, Bureau indices, FBI

Identification Division records, and local credit and arrest

records.

Of course, prior to instituting any background

investigation to qualify a ghetto informant, he must be in a

position to furnish racial information and must be willing

to cooperate with the Bureau.

This individual will be carried

as a probationary racial informant and the Agent contacting

him will be constantly alert for any indications of character

traits or activities which might cause embarrassment to the

Bureau.

In addition, the information furnished by such an

informant will not be taken 6h-face value but will be verified

through other sources

and investigation where possible.

In addition, we are

specifically instructing that

security informants active in the racial field be designated

as racial informants and that their activities be supervised

by the Racial Informant Desk.

We are also reiterating our

instructions that it is imperative and essential that the

Bureau learn of any. advance planning or organized conspiracy

Re:

on the part of individuals or organizations in connection

with riots and

the instructions that informants should be alerted and aí-

rected to obtain information concerning individuals who may

be stockpiling firebombs, Molotov cocktails, and weapons,

and to identify any groups of terrorists who may be planning

on carrying on a type of guerrilla warfare during riotous

situations.

In connection with our intensive investigation of

black militant groups, we are requiring all offices engaged

in the Black Nationalist Groups TOPLEV Informant Program

(There are 35 field offices involved in this Program.) to

assign a mininum of one Agent to work exclusively on infor-

mant matters.

The results of this endeavor will be reviewed

after a three-month pilot period and additional recommenda-

tions will be made accordingly. The field will be followed

closely to insure that the number and quality of racial in

formants are developed at a regular rate.

(G) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- In view of the in-

creasing problems with which we are faced in the racial field, particularly

in the development of racial intelligence concerning militant black

nationalist elements, a careful analysis of this matter has been made in

order to insure that proper emphasis is placed where needed. Also, in

order to afford better coordination over all interrelated racial security

matters (individuals and organizations) including the development of

racial informants, supervision is now being handled by the Racial

Intelligence Section of the Domestic Intelligence Division. For your

information, the Subversive Control Section is no longer in existence.

The investigation of the Communist Party and related matters other

than those with a racial aspect are being handled by the Internal Security

Section.

Our analysis of the racial informant program has shown

there is a definite need to develop additional penetrative coverage of the

militant black nationalist groups and the ghetto areas immediately to

be in a position to have maximum intelligence in anticipation of another

outburst of racial violence next summer.

In line with our objective, particular emphasis is being

placed on the development of ghetto-type racial informants. Individuals

to qualify as this type of informant must live or work in an area described

as a ghetto and, therefore, have access to pertinent racial information.

The steps necessary to qualify such an individual are as follows:

(1) The individual must have access to racial intelligence

information and must be willing to cooperate with the Bureau in furnish-

ing such information.

(2) In the absence of any derogatory information developed,

it will be necessary for you to check the following: field office indices,

FBI Identification Division records, and local credit and arrest records.

Of course, you must develop sufficient background data concerning each

prospective informant to allow an intelligent check of the foregoing

records to be made. As to the method of recommending to the Bureau

that an individual be approved as a racial informant (ghetto-type), be

guided by the instructions set out in Section 130, Volume IV, Manual

of Instructions, concerning probationary racial informants.

All individuals recommended and approved as ghetto-type

racial informants will be considered probationary racial informants

with the word "ghetto" after the informant's name or symbol. An

example of this is "John Jones,

Probationary Racial Informant (Ghetto)"

or "NY 1234-R (PROB - Ghetto). "

Agents handling these ghetto-type probationary racial inform-

ants must be constantly alert for any indications of character traits or

activities of these informants which might cause embarrassment to the

Bureau. In addition, the information furnished by these informants

should not be taken at face value. A diligent attempt- must be made

to verify all information furnished by these informants through other

sources and/or investigation.

In addition, immediately review all security informant files

for the purpose of determining which security informants are solely or

predominantly active in the racial field. Examples would be individuals

furnishing information concerning the Minutemen, as well as the Nation

of Islam, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Congress of

Racial Equality, and other militant black nationalist-type groups. The

security designation of these informants should be changed to the

appropriate racial informant designation. For example, a potential

security informant should be made a probationary racial informant and

a security informant should be designated as a racial informant. There-

aiter, they should be operated principally in the racial field and super-

vised by the Racial Informant Desk. When an informant is changed from

a security informant to a racial informant, the field classification

number should be changed to a 170 classification. Advise the Bureau

promptly as to which security informants are being converted to racial

informants.

In addition, each office having a Black Nationalist Groups

TOPLEV Informant Program is to immediately assign at least one™

Agent to work exclusively on developing informants under this Program.

Each office participating in this Program will submit at the end of a

three-month period appropriate observations as to the success of the

Program and recommendations as to its continuance.

As I have advised in the past, it is imperative and essential

that the Bureau learn of any indications of advance planning or organized

To obtain approval to send a letter to all con-

BACKGROUND:

Following the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr.,

Bureau Agents conducted numerous interviews in ghetto

areas of U. S. cities as a result of racial disorders.

Productive contacts made with individualsdring these inter-

views are avaluable source of untapped informant potential.

By, following up these interviews by recontacting cooperative

residents of the ghetto areas, the Bureau can obtain a

higher quality and larger number of ghetto informants.

Receiving offices are instructed to exploit this situation

by developing, through contacts made during riots, additional

probationary racial informants (ghetto).

It is imperative that the Bureau utilize every

In the wake of the racial upheavals following the

murder of Martin Luther King, Jt., numerous U. S. cities

experienced racial violence in various degrees.

In keeping the Bureau and interested agencies

fully advised of the rapidly developing events in these

cities, Bureau Agents interviewed a great number of

individuals who vere in positions to report on the under-

currents prevalent in the ghetto areas of these cities.

Undoubtedly these interviews opened up a whole

new

avenue of informant development, on a block-to-block

basis, in the crucial areas of the ghettos of American

cities.

Those offices covering cities which recently

experienced racial strife are expected to take immediate

steps to exploit this situation and increase the quality

and quantity of ghetto informant coverage.

Those individuals in the ghetto areas who furnished

valuable information to the Bureau in these crises

should be reinterviewed and consideration given to developing

them as probationary racial informants (ghetto)

119, the Bec

Sullivan, Tavel, Casper, Callahan,

Trotter, Conrad, Gale, Bishop, Scatterday for Rosen, Walters

for Felt, and Beaver,

considered a recommendation by Assistant

Director Sullivan that a survey be made of the Negro ghetto

areas where violence has occurred or where there is a concen-

tration of militant, violence-prone, black power elements in

order to determine the racial informant coverage in those areas.

Complete details are set out in attached memorandum and proposed

letter to all continental offices dealing with this matter.

Basically, the purpose of this survey is to enable both the

the Bureau to evaluate the adequacy of informant

coverage in these reas and to pinpolnt areas in which zaited

coverage is needed.

This assignment could be completed

in each office

by one Agent in less than one day from information already

available in

each field division, it being noted that on every

inspection the inspector requires the field to identify its

ghetto areas.

Following consideration, the Executive Conference

unanimously recommended that this survey be conducted.

The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend

approval for the attached letter to all continental field

divisions which contains instructions to furnish to the

Bureau information concerning ghetto-type informant coverage

in Negro ghetto areas where there has been violence or where

today there is a concentration of militant violence prone

black power elements and the adequacy of such coverage.

By SAC Letter 67-62 (G) dated 10/17/67 captioned

"Racial Informants, Racial Matters," all offices were given

instructions and guidelines for the development of ghetto-type

racial informants in areas where potential racial violence

exists. We have aggressively followed this matterwith the

field since that time but because of the widely divergent

nature of cities across the Nation where possible racial

problems exist, we have been unable to precisely evaluate the

extent of the need of ghetto-type informants in each division.

Attached letter to all continental offices requires the submission

by each office of factual information concerning the numbers

of all Negro ghetto areas where there has been violence of

where today there is a concentration of militant violence prone

black power elements, an estimate of the population of each

such area, and statistics concerning the numbers of ghetto-type

racial informants developed to cover such areas.

It also

requires that each field division advise how many ghetto

informants it believes it should have in each of the above

type ghetto areas in order to provide the coverage required

the Bureau.

Memorandum to Mr. W. C. Sullivan

RE: RACIAL INFORMANTS

Attached letter will serve two purposes.

Each

office will have to make a factual survey of pertinent

aspects of the racial problem in all urban areas covered

by it. This survey will serve to drive home to each office

the size of the potential problem in each division and will

force each office to formulate concrete plans for developing

adequate informant coverage where such has not already been

done.

Secondly, the information submitted by each office

will give the Bureau a comprehensive picture of the potential

problem in each division which will enable the Bureau to

more effectively evaluate the adequacy of the ghetto-type

racial informant program in each office. Supervisory personnel

will be able to more easily detect shortcomings and weaknesses

in any given division with this information at hand.

To obtain the information requested by this letter

should not be a burden on the field in that it should only

take the time of one Agent for less than one day to compile

the information concerning the ghetto areas from the information

already available in the field divisions. It is to be noted

that on every inspection the inspector requires the field

to identify its ghetto areas and those areas having a potential

for violence.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the attached proposed letter to all continental

field offices in accordance with the

above, be approved.

RE: RACIAL INFORMANTS

For your guidance, the goal you should be setting

as

to how many ghetto informants are needed in a particular

area is that your coverage should be such that you are completely

knowledgeable concerning all pertinent racial activities in a

particular area. The type of information you should be seceiving

from your ghetto informants is advance information as to whether

anyone is planning to cause a racial disturbance, stockpiling

weapons for use during a racial disturbance, full details

concerning the activities of militant black nationalists and

white extremists in ghetto areas, as well as any other activitier

which may bring about a racial disturbance.

I expect that immediate attention will be given this

matter and I also expect that the Bureau will be kept advised

of progress being made in this field. Progress will be followed

closely and the desired results are expected to be produced.

PURPOSE:

To obtain authority to send the attached letter to

aLl Special Agents in Charge changing the maximum permissible

perrod between contacts with ghetto-type racial informants

trom two weeks, as presently required by the Manual of

Instructions, to one month.

BACKGROUND:

The ghetto-type racial informant program was

established in October, 1967, to develop

• sources living or

working in ghetto areas

who are in a position to keep the

Bureau advisedal situations of potential violence.

Ghetto-

type racial informants are distinguished from regular racial

informants in that they are not associated with or reporting

regularly on black extremists. Their primary purpose is to

detect and report on all violence-prone elements, activities,

and situations in ghetto areas which could spark riots or

assist black extremists in any way.

REGULAR RACIAL INFORMANTS STILL CONTACTED AT LEAST EVERY

TWO WEEKS:

No change in present Manual of Instructions require-

ments that regular racial informants be contacted at least

Once every

two weeks is contemplated.

Because of the rapport

established with ghetto-type racial intormants, the field is

often able to direct such informants into membership in or

association with black extremist groups.

When such is the

RE: RACIAL INFORMANTS

case, these individuals are converted from ghetto-type racial

informants to regular racial informants.

It approval is given

to extend the maximum period between contacts with established

ghetto-type racial informants to one month, any such informant

who is converted to a regular racial informant will again be

subject to the requirement that he be contacted at least once

every two weeks.

OBSERVATIONS:

Laporers, clerks, housewives, businessmen,

and

numerous other types of individuals are developed as ghetto-

type racial informants. Frequent initial contacts with each

such individual are necessary (1) to establish adequate rapport,

(2) to insure that each such individual is fully aware of the

nature of and the seriousness of his assignments, and (3) to

establish adequate channels ot communications suitable for

use at any time.

Once these goals are achieved, the informant

can be considered established and contacts every two weeks are

no longer necessary since the primary purpose of each such

informant is to remain alert to information of value and promptly

relay same. Once a ghetto-type racial informant is established,

contacts once each month will be adequate. To definitely fix

the time at which a ghetto-type racial informant is considered

established, the Special Agent handling

• this informant will be

required to place a memorandum in informant's file stating

that requirements (1), (2), and (3), mentioned above, have been

met and that informant is considered

established.

SAVINGS FROM LENGTHENING PERIOD BETWEEN CONTACTS:

As of August 1, 1968, there were 3,248 ghetto-

type racial informants developed by the field.

New Informants

of this type are developed daily.

Since Special Agents handLing

this type informant are presently required to contact each such

individual at least once every two weeks, there are a minimum

of 6,496 contacts being made each month.

Even if a contact

lasts but a few minutes, the manpower expenditure is considerable.

It the maximum permissible period between contacts is extended

to one month, manpower expenditures will be cut in half.

ACTION:

If approved, attached letter to all Special Agents

in Charge will

be sent in accordance with the above and appropriate

Manual changes will be prepared.

Purpose of this memorandum is to obtain approval for

that theyGhetto Racial Informant Program in each office be analyzed

l in detail to insure that each field office is obtaining the full

potential from is network of ghetto informants.

We are presently operating 4,469 ghetto informants

throughout the United States. These informants are producing

valuable racial information on a regular basis. For example, during

the past year ghetto informants were able to furnish information

which was given to the local police and was helpful in containing

racial disturbances. In addition, since April, 1969, our informants

have been responsible for bringing about the arrest of 283

individuals (195 local

and' 88 Federal

arrests) and have been

responsible for selving 63 other cases, and recoveries valued

at $82, 038.40.

Although the ghetto informant program is procucuive,

review has clearly shown that certain field offices are getting

far more results from their ghetto informants than others. In

view of this it is believed every field office should analyze

their program.

In view of this, each field division should analyze

The attendees at the recent Specialized Training of

Bureau Personnel conferences concerning informant matters recommended

I that instructions be furnished to the field to the effect that

in addition to having ghetto informants as listening posts, a

larger percentage of these informants be given direction so that

Ithey will be actively seeking racial information on a regular basis.

The Ghetto Informant Program was instituted in July, 1967,

in order that the Bureau would have access to pertinent racial

information in the ghetto areas in anticipation of outbursts of

racial violence. This program has proven to be very successful;

however, it was noted that some field divisions were operating

their ghetto informants as listening posts and other divisions

were actively operating the ghetto informants by giving them

positive assignments.

5-Dlepiet's

It is noted we are presently operating 4,520 ghetto

informants and it is essential that we have some operated as

listening posts but we would also achieve greater efficiency

if the greater number of these informants were given positive

assignments in the racial field.

These assignments would include

attendance at public meetings held by extremists, surveys of

extremist bookstores, verification of residence and employment

of Agitator and Security Index subjects who may live or work

in ghetto areas, identification of extremists who may be agitating

in a local area, as well as furnishing information concerning the

activities of youth gangs operating in the area when these activities

may tend to increase racial tensions. In addition, ghetto informants

because of their access to criminal information, could furnish

information concerning both Federal and local crimes.//..

R&: GHETTO RACIAL INFORMANTS

-=

Index subjects who may live or work in ghetto areas,

identification of extremists who may be agitating in a local

area, as well as furnishing information concerning the

activities of youth gangs operating in the area when these

activities may tend to increase racial tensions.

It is recognized that certain individuals presently

being operated as ghetto informants would be more useful in

their role as listening posts; therefore, they should be

continued as such.

In line with the above, each ghetto racial informant

file should be reviewed in connection with the regular review

of ghetto informant files in order to determine whether the informan

should be operated as a listening post or whether he should be

given positive assignments as set out above.

In the future development of ghetto racial informants

you should strive to obtain quality ghetto informants,

particularly the type which can be operated so they will be

actively seeking racial införmation in their ghetto areas.

It is to be noted that when ghetto informants are furnishing

information on a regular basis concerning extremist activity

they should be designated as probationary racial informants

and the ghetto designation deleted. An aggressive and

Imaginative approach to the Ghetto Informant Program will

enhance the overall Racial Informant Program in every

field division by producing on a regular basis, individuals

who can be directed to positions where they will have access

to pertinent racial information on a regular baris..

To obtain authority to revise current policy with

regard to the administrative handling of the Ghetto Informant

Program.

The Ghetto Intormant Program instituted in July, 1967,

Ior the purpose of providing the Bureau with in-depth racial

coverage in ghetto areas.

We currently operate 4520 ghetto

informants throughout the Nation.

This informant program is

productive with its value having

been clearly established. We

have been exploring methods to administratively streanline this

program to reduce paperwork and

correspondence; in this regard

it was suggested during a recent Specialized Training of Bureau

Personnel conference concerning informant matters that we

discontinue the classification of probationary ghetto informants

and

permit Special Agents in Charge to authorize and supervise

all ghetto informants within their respective territories requir

ing

that only a number count be included in the monthly racial

informant progress letter.

Current, policy requires that removal of the proba

tionary status on

ghetto informants be on Bureau authority

after notification that specific requirements have been met.

Proposed plan eliminates necessity for the probationary status

and will place all ghetto informants in one classification

-

upon completion of necessary requirements on SAC approval.

The recommended procedure will materially reduce corespondence

between the field and the Bureau.

Additionally above

recommendation eliminates the necessity for the currently

required two-week contact with probationary ghetto informants

which was necessary at the beginning of the program and will

place all ghetto informants under a thirty-day contact rule

whick we feel is more realistic at this the lYin

In Ridgeway lin. Kif tri

To obtain authority to revise current policy with regard

to maintenance of subfiles concerning ghetto informants.

As a result of recent specialized training of Bureau

personnel conferences concerning racial matters, it was recomnended

that the maintenance of field office subfiles concerning ghetto in-

formants be left to the option of the Special Agent in Charge (SAC).

Current policy requires that reports written or oral

(reduced to writing) from racial informants including ghetto

informants be filed in a field office subfile. Many ghetto

informants serve only as "listening posts" and often furnish only)

information to the effect all is quiet. This type of information

is considered positive information and

according to current re-

quirements a copy of the report should be placed in the informant

subfile along with a copy in the racial situation control file.

In view of the nature of "listening post" type infor-

mation it is believed sufficient to place a copy of the report in

the racial situation control file, thereby eliminating the

necessity for its inclusion in a subfile.

The above policy change

is considered a streamlining device materially reducing paper work

currently involved in the maintenance of the ghetto files and will

increase the efficiency of our operation.

RECOMMENDATION:

That a to SA totten in andanto thale

be approved and sent to all SACs.

If approved, appropriate

Manual changes will be prepared.

(D) GHETTO INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- As a result of re-

cent conferences concerning racial informants held at the Seat of Govern-

ment, it has been recommended and approved that ghetto informants be

approved on the authority of the Special Agent in Charge and that the

probationary status of these informants will no longer be necessary.

Current policy requires that before a ghetto informant can be removed

from a probationary status the Bureau must be advised that certain

specific requirements have been satisfied; thereafter, Bureau authori-

zation is given to remove the probationary status of the informant. You

will no longer be required to advise the Bureau of the identity of the

ghetto informants and your only requirement will be to give the number

of ghetto informants currently being operated by your office at the time

you submit your monthly racial informant status report.

Current investigation required concerning development

of ghetto informants will remain in effect and it will be the responsi-

bility of each SAC to assure the necessary requirements are fulfilled

before approving these informants.

In addition to the above change it will no longer be necessary

to contact any ghetto informants on a two-week basis as was required in

the handling of probationary ghetto informants. You are now required

to contact ghetto informants on a 30-day basis.

The above changes do not affect your requirements to ob-

tain Bureau authority concerning ghetto informants who will be utilized

in connection with educational institutions.

The above changes should materially ease the administrative

handling of your Ghetto Informant Program and provide you with more

time to develop additional productive ghetto informants throughout your

territory.

Appropriate Manual changes are forthcoming.

E) RACIAL INFORMANTS - GHETTO INFORMANTS -- As a result of recent

racial informant conferences held at the Seat of Government, a recom-

mendation was made and approved giving the Special Agent in Charge

(SAC) the option of maintaining subfiles concerning ghetto informants.

As you are aware, current policy concerning subfiles relating

to ghetto informants requires that a subfile be maintained on all ghetto

informants regardless of whether or not they are furnishing only "listen-

ing post' type information. Effective immediately, the maintenance of a

subfile for your ghetto informants is being left to the option of the SAC.

There is little reason to maintain a subfile on those ghetto informants

who are used primarily as "listening posts" and furnish information con-

cerning attitudes and tensions within a ghetto area. It will suffice to

place a copy of the report (FD-209) in the racial situation control file,

thereby eliminating its inclusion in a subfile.

Subfiles may be necessary in those instances when ghetto

informants are reporting valuable substantive information.

Appropriate Manual change forthcoming.

accomplishments in the racial field on a regular basis all

the Ghetto Intormant Program was instituted by memorandum

G. C. Moore to Mr.

w. C. Sullivan, dated 10-11-67, captioned

"Racial Informants, Racial Matters." A ghetto informant is an

individual who resides or works in an area described as a ghetto

and can furnish pertinent general racial information. At the

present time we are operating 5,178 ghetto informants and as of

This is an

During the past year ghetto informants have been responsible

not only for obtaining valuable racial intelligence in the ghetto

areas but also for bringing about the arrest of 76 individuals, 43

on Federal charges and 33 on local charges. In addition, these

informants were responsible for solving 88 other cases, nine of

which were Federal and 79 local as well as bringing about

recoveries valued in excess of $67,660. The types of cases

involved in this were bank robberies, mail robberies, stolen

automobiles, deserters, narcotics, assaults and general fugitive

matters.

As to the racial intelligence furnished by ghetto

informants during the past year it has been responsible for not

only preventing racial violence in certain areas but also for

identifying those individuals who have perpetrated violent acts

in connection with racial disturbances. These informants have

also furnished information concerning acquisitions of firearms

by racial extremists as well as information concerning individuals

In accordance with the Director's request the

following is set forth to show the difference between a

racial informant and a ghetto

A racial

intormant is an individual who is

furnishing information on a confidential basis concerning

extremist groups (black or white) as well as information

concerning individuals who are members of these groups.

A ghetto informant is an individual who lives

or works in' a ghetto area

rea and has access to information

regarding the racial situation and racial activities in

his area which he furnishes to the Bureau on a confidential

basis.

The difference between the above types of informants

is that the racial informant is targeted towards extremist

organizations and their members whereas the ghetto informant

furnishes general racial information and is not a member of

an extremist group.

#o: 2544-111-219X

At the present time we are operating 953 racial

informants and 6,024 ghetto informants.

The combination

of these two types of sources gives us a combined total of

Ghetto informants are approved by the authority

Purpose of this memorandum is to advise concerning

the racial Ghetto Informant Program in respect to the article

which appeared in Sunday's 7/4/71 edition of "The Washington

Post" highlighting this Program.

"The Washington Post" article captioned "Analysis

of Stolen FBI Documents Provides Glimpse of Bureau at Work, "

(copy of which is attached), sets out the Bureau instituted

a new program "ghetto informants" to cover the ghettos of

America. The analysis in the article is based on the

stolen documents from the Media, Pennsylvania, Resident Agency.

The article sets forth that some of the specific

assignments were to attend and report on open meetings of

known or suspected black extremists, visit black Afro-type

bookstores to determine if extremist literature is available

and report on changes of the attitudes of the Negro community

toward the white community which may lead to racial violence.

The Ghetto Informant Program was instituted in

October, 1967, by memorandum dated 10/11/67 from G. C. Moore

to Mr. W. C. Sullivan captioned "Racial Informant, Racial Matters."

It was recommended

and approved that the Bureau develop sources

living or working in ghetto areas who are in a position to

keep the Bureau advised of situations of potential violence.

This was necessary because of our responsibility of developing

racial intelligence concerning black extremists who could

foment: racial violence in the ghetto areas. 170 - 2-

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. Brennan

Re: Ghetto Informant Program

This Program has been productive in furnishing racial

intelligence information which has been responsible for not

only preventing racial violence but also identifying individuals

who have perpetrated act of violence during racial disturbances,

identifying individuals attempting to sell explosives,

individuals who participated in firebombings as well as

reporting on the activities while racial disturbances were

occurring.

In addition, these ghetto informants along with all

our racial informants from January to May 31, 1971, were

responsible for bringing about the arrest of 231 individuals,

on both local and Federal charges, 64 af which were FBI

fugitives, as well as being responsible for the recovery of

$63,865 in stolen merchandise.

OBSERVATIONS:

The Ghetto Informant Frogram is a sound program even

if the liberal press such as "The Washington Post"

using

stolen documents attempts to imply that the Bureau through

this Program is checking on every black living in a ghetto

area. Such a task would be impossible. At the present time

we have 6,301 ghetto informants throughout the U.s.

These

are mostly Negro individuals who are cooperating with the

Bureau in order to help fight the extremist and criminal

elements in their reighborhoods which jeopardize and disrupt

the law abiding Negro citizen.

This Program is analyzed on a regular basis through

field inspections, inspection of the Seat of Government and

through supervision by the Domestic Intelligence Division.

In view of the need for racial intelligence that is provided

by the Program and its productivity, we will continue to

operate it in accordance with Bureau standards.

ACTION: For information.

The incident frames a cru-

stop?

The Media documents pro-

this question, but they do

contain a series of similar

accepting the negative re-

In order to increase the productivity of the Ghetto

Informant Program, there is attached for approval an airtel to

all continental field offices instructing that each Special Agent

in Charge (SAC) thoroughly evaluate the Ghetto Informant Program

in his respective division and submit recommendations for

improving the program in line with the guidelines set forth by

the Bureau.

The Ghetto Informant Program was instituted 10-11-67.

A ghetto informant is an individual who resides or works in an

area described as a ghetto and can furnish general information

concerning extremist activity.

When originally instituted, the

ghetto informant was mainly a listening post; however, with the

change in extremist activities, a good number of these informants

were given positive assignments, which assignments definitely

increased the productivity in certain field divisions.

At the present time we are operating 6,541 ghetto

informants. This is a valuable reservoir of individuals who

-should be elevated into positions in extremist organizations.

In addition, by increasing the productivity of the ghetto

Informants, the Bureau will be in a position of obtaining

additional

criminal statistics.

It is to be noted that in addition to obtaining

information concerning extremist activities, the ghetto informants

along with other extremist informants since January 1, 1971, have

been responsible for bringing about the arrest of 445

i individuals on

both local and Federal charges, 127 of which were FBI

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

RE: GHETTO INFORMANT PROGRAM

well as being responsible for the recovery of $193,181.28 in

stolen merchandise. With the increase in extremist activity as

seen by the disturbances in penal institutions, the unprovoked

attacks against police and the definite trend concerning

guerrilla warfare throughout the U.S., we must accelerate our

penetration of extremist groups.

Accordingly, in order to fully utilize our vast

reservoir of ghetto informants, it is believed each SAC should

be instructed to evaluate the Ghetto Informant Program in his

division along the following lines.

1. Ascertain the number of ghetto informants that

have been elevated into extremist organizations. 2. Determine

what percentage of the ghetto informants are given positive

assignments on a regular basis. 3. Evaluate the extremist

intelligence accomplishments of the ghetto informants in the

particular field division. 4. Evaluate the criminal

statistical accomplishments. 5. Set forth specific steps

being taken to not only increase the productivity of the

Ghetto Informant Program but also the steps being taken to

elevate the ghetto informants into extremist organizations.

Upon receipt of the above from each continental field

office, analysis will be made and appropriate instructions will

be furnished all field divisions concerning the future handling

of ghetto informants.

ACTION:

That attached airtel to all continental field offices

be approved furnishing instructions concerning the ghetto

The increasing need to fully penetrate all extremist

groups in U. S. dictates that we fully use the vast reservoir

of individuals now being operated as ghetto informants; there-

fore, each SAC must fully evaluate his ghetto informant program

so that the Bureau may evaluate this program as a whole.

The

_evaluation should include but not necessarily be

limited to: l. Number of ghetto informants elevated into

extremist organizations. 2. Determination of percentage of

ghetto informants regularly given positive assignments.

3.

Evaluation of extremist intelligence accomplishments of

these informants. 4. Evaluation of their criminal statistical

accomplishments. 5. Specific steps taken to not only increase

the productivity of the ghetto informant program but also the

steps being taken to elevate the ghetto informants into

extremist organizations.

Ghetto intormants should be so operated as to elevate

them to key positions in extra?.

The evaluation of the ghetto informant program made by

each continental field division clearly shows that there is a

definite relationship between the accomplishments of this program

and the percentage of ghetto informants being given positive

assignments.

In additton, the ghetto intormant brogran has proven to bey!?

* a most productive program not only in the extremist intelligence

field but it has also shown that ghetto infommants can be helpful in

so sam to at yet

obtaining criminal statistical accomplishments. Since 2/1/71 ghetto

infornants: have been responsible for bringing about the arrest of

I11 individuals, 51 of whom were Bureau fugitives, as well as

bringing about the recovery of $49,999.

In view of the increase of guerrilla warfare activity on

the part of black extremists, it is necessary that we develop

additional informant coverage to obtain information concerning this

activity. .

community (ghetto areas); therefore, our ghetto informants

must be targeted to obtain information concerning this

guerrilla warfare activity.

In order to fulfill our responsibilities in this

field, each field division must promptly improve both the

number and quality of ghetto informants in accordance with the

guidelines set forth below: (1) New ghetto informants

developed must be the type who can obtain information concerning

black extremists who are operating in the ghetto areas and

planning or perpetrating guerrilla-type activities such as

robberies, attacks on police, and other violent activities;

(2) The recent survey of ghetto informants showed that the

productivity of the program in each field office was in direct

relation to the percentage of ghetto informants being given

positive assignments. Those field divisions achieving greater

productivity are the ones who had a greater percentage of their

ghetto infornants being given positive assignments.

Accordingly,

on your ID-405b setting orth your extrenist informant accomplish-

ments you must set forth the percentage of your ghetto informants

being given positive assignments.

Each ghetto informant must be evaluated on a yearly

basis; and if it is determined that the informant has not

produced positive extrenist intelligence-type information, which

information would include criminal-type information, the informant

must be closed and a new ghetto informant developed.

It is expected that the quality and quantity of ghetto

informants will be improved in the near future in order that the

Bureau may fulfill its responsibilities in the extremist

intelligence field.

Purpose of this memorandum is to obtain approval for

attached airtel to all continental field offices instructing that

the extremist ghetto informant program be upgraded in accordance

with the guidelines set out in order to increase the productivity

of this program and to obtain information concerning the present

phase of extremist activity, namely, the guerrilla warfare phase.

By airtel dated 9/22/71 all continental field offices

were instructed to evaluate the ghetto informant program.

These

evaluations have been received and reviewed.

The review clearly

shows that those field offices giving the majority of their ghetto

informants positive assignments are achieving not only positive

intelligence information but also valuable criminal statistical

accomplishments. These informants, since 2/1/71, have been

responsible for bringing about the arrest of 111 individuals, 51

of which were Bureau fugitives, and the recovery of $49,999

stolen merchandise, weapons, and cars.

In addition, we are now seeing another phase of extremist

activity, that is the guerrilla warfare phase, as opposed to the

mass demonstrations which occurred in the past. Extremisis are

involved in expropriations (robberies), killing of police,

and other terroristic activities. The extremists involved in

guerrilla warfare have very limited or no contact with the

aboveground extremist organizations; therefore, our coverage has

been limited in this respect.

The guerrilla operates within the

community (the ghetto area, and this is the area where we also

operate oux ghetto informants; therefore, our ghetto informants

should be targeted toward developing information concerning

•acts

,of guerrilla warfare.

This is to justify continuance of captioned program

in view of the fact that this program is producing substantial

accomplishments in the extremist field on a regular basis.

During the past year these informants have furnished

intelligence information concerning extremist activities which

has brought about the arrest of Black Panther Party (BPP) members

on armed robbery charges, identified individuals responsible for

a fire bombing of a food store, identified individuals who have

been involved in murder cases, as well as information which

brought about the recovery of weapons and ammunition, and

information which has been of assistance to local police in

handling civil disturbances.

While the primary objective of the ghetto informant

program is to obtain information concerning extremist activities,

it also provides substantial accomplishments in the criminal

field in that these informants either live or work in ghetto

areas which are usually high crime areas. During the period

7/1/71 to 4/30/72 ghetto informants were responsible for bringing

about the arrest of 305 individuals (174 local and state, 131

Federal), of whom 85 were FBI fugitives. In addition, these

informants were responsible for the recovery of $174,994*

occur in the form of disturbances and riots. As the program

progressed it was noted that these informants could be operated

in such a manner to increase their value by giving them positive

assignments to develop information concerning black extremists

who are operating in ghetto areas and planning or perpetrating

guerrilla-type activities such as robberies, attacks on police,

and other violent activities. In addition, the field has

constantly been reminded of the potential of ghetto informants

to obtain criminal information in addition to the extremist

intelligence, and this has paid off as indicated above.

Information has recently been developed indicating

black extremists are obtaining funds by robbing narcotics

dealers. Accordingly, the field has been instructed to target

ghetto informants specifically toward ascertaining the identities

of narcotics dealers in their particular areas as well as

obtaining information concerning plans of black extremists to

rob these individuals.

The ghetto informant program is a sound program and

is analyzed on a regular basis through field inspections,

inspections at FBI Headquarters, and through supervision

by

the Domestic Intelligence Division. In view of the need for

extremist intelligence information provided by this program

and its productivity, it is believed this program should be

continued, and it will be reevaluated in July, 1973.

ACTION:

If approved, this program will be continued and

rejustified in July, 1973.

This is to obtain authority to implement a modified

ghetto informant program which will reduce the number of ghetto

informants by fifty per cent without impairing the efficiency

of the operation.

After careful analysis of the ghetto informant pro-

gram during the recent inspection of the Domestic Intelligence

Division, it was concluded that a modified ghetto informant pro-

gram would streamline and improve efficiency of the existing

program. This will be achieved by having only Special Agents

assigned to extremist matters handling ghetto informants.

Experience has shown that Special Agents experienced in extremist

matters are in a better position to achieve maximum use of ghetto

informants.

Growing civil unrest in the mid-1960s created an urgent

need for a comprehensive network of "listening post" type sources

within ghetto areas to provide advance intelligence information

relating to civil unrest. To fill this need the ghetto informant

program was initiated on October 11, 1967. The ghetto informant

program proved highly successful and subsequently these informants

were directed to areas of greater responsibility in addition to

their "listening post" function. A notable byproduct of these

informants has been their ability to furnish highlyfsignificant

criminal information.

Re: Ghetto Informant Program

explosive element smouldering within the ghetto areas throughout

the Nation. This volatile force, more sophisticated than in the

past, frequently surfaces in the form of urban guerrilla terrorist-

type activities often by unaffiliated extremists, resulting in the

sniping and killing of police, firebombings, and other violent

criminal activities. The current threat of civil unrest in the

ghetto is perhaps an even greater menace to our society than the

unrest we have witnessed in the past.

To cope with this continuing

undercurrent, a more selective ghetto informant program is necessary.

The primary purpose of our modified ghetto informant pro-

gram is to provide a highly selective corps of "listening post"

informants versed in the type of information desired by the Bureau

which will assure we are abreast of growing civil unrest and

developing extremist activities.

This can best be accomplished

by having ghetto informants exclusively handled by those Special

Agents assigned to extremist matters. Inasmuch as ghetto informants

generally work or reside in high crime areas and frequently associ-

ated with the criminal element, we will continue to encourage the

acceptance of criminal information coming to the attention of these

informants.

While we expect a fifty percent decrease in the 7,514

ghetto informants currently being operated, the modified ghetto

informant program in no way diminishes the

responsibility of the

Special Agent in Charge (SAC) to have "listening post" type sources

in those ghetto areas where there is a potential for civil unrest

or extremist activity. In addition, the SAC will be instructed to

carefully analyze each current ghetto informant and those with the

best potential to be retained as ghetto informants or elevated to

probationary extremist informant and others, if appropriate, redesig

nated as criminal informants or discontinued.

Some SACs have levied an arbitrary rule requiring Special

RE: GHETTO INFORMANT PROGRAM

EXTREMIST MATTERS

To achieve greater efficiency and maximum utilization

of our ghetto infornants and to reemphasize the "listening post"

concept of these informants, & modified progran designed to

reduce the number of existing ghetto informants has been instituted.

Effective immediately all ghetco informants are to be exclusively

handled by those Special igents assigned to extremist matters.

Experience has show chat Agents knowledgeable in extremist matters

are better qualified to realize the full potential of ghetto

informants.

With the implementation of the nodified program, you

will be expected to redesignate or close at least 50 percent

of your ghetto informants.

Accordingly, carefully analyze each

of your ghetto informants

and the most qualified should be retained

as ghetto informants or elevated, if appropriate, to probationary

extremist informants.

In the event you have ghetto informants

predominately furnishing criminal information they should be

designated criminal informants. All others are to be discontinued.

While it remains the primary purpose of the ghetto

Informant program to provide "listening post" type sources in

ghetto areas where there is a potential for civil unrest or

extremist activities, you are still expected to fully utilize

these informants by giving them specific assignments where appro-

priate.

Because these informants generally live land work Ir

high crime areas, you are encouraged to continue

Re: Ghetto Informant Program

This modified program in no way mininizes your

responsibility for having an aggressive and effective ghetto

Informant program and in this regard you are still required

on a yearly basis to evaluate each ghetto informant pursuant

to instructions set out in airtel fron Director to ilbany

dated November 24, 1971, Captioned "Upgrading Extremist

Ghetto Informants."

In the past, some Special Agents in Charge have

levied an arbitrary rule requiring Special Agents, regardless

of assignnent, to develop ghetto informants. This practice

is to be discontinued.

Promptly advise the Bureau, under the Ghetto Informant

Program caption, when you have completed your transition to

the modified program setting forth the number of ghetto informants

retained, closed, or reassigned as criminal, security, or

extremist informants.

Ms. Herwig

/

A request to reduce the number of ghetto informants by fifty

percent, which gives the appearance of being an arbitrary figure,

AGREE

immediately suggests the need to explore thoroughly the merits of the

ghetto informant program and to consider what, if any, more practical

alternatives might exist.

An informant who is classified as a ghetto informant, as dis-

tinguished from a criminal, security, potential security or extremist

informant, appears to be one who is expected to provide advance

intelligence information relating to civil unrest. In evaluating the

program, it is therefore important to know of each instance since the

program was begun on Ocotber 11, 1967, in which intelligence informa-

tion prior to an urban riot or upheaval was obtained from a ghetto

informant.

I am not referring to criminal and security information.

If

the information from a ghetto informant fits within one of these two

categories, it would seem more plausible for the informant to be

carried as a criminal, a security, a potential security or an extremist

informant. Only if he has furnished intelligence information concerning

an urban riot or upheaval should an informant be designated as a

ghetto informant.

S1514. REC 43 170 M

1420 NOV T-1972

Classifying the informant as a ghetto informant whew yo

information obtained from him falls only within the criminal or security

field is not a mere matter of semantics. It seems apparent from the

Agents Handbook, Part I, pp. 20a and 20b, that carrying a person as a

ghetto informant involves a vast expenditure of Agent and clerical time.

There has to be a background investigation, at least one contact a month

and, in some instances, progress letters to the Bureau every six months.

Memorandum for Mr. Gray

Re: Ghetto Informant Program

Extremist Matters

Although I have not seen the answers to the question referred

to above as to the instances in which ghetto informants have furnished the

type information which was expected of them when the program was

established, my initial opinion is that the ghetto informant program has

not produced any information which could not be obtained by (1) regular

debriefing of criminal, security, potential security, and extremist

informants; (2) liaison with local police departments who, as a part of

the increasing emphasis upon better police-community relations, are

much closer to the pulse of the local ghetto community than may have

been the case heretofore, and who have probably always been closer to

the ghetto than the FBI could ever hope to be; and (3) volunteered

information from interested citizens.

The last paragraph of the Moore to Miller memorandum of

9/8/72 impliedly suggests what I believe to be the major justification

for continuing a separate program under the heading of ghetto informants.

SACs do not levy an arbitrary rule requiring SA's to develop ghetto

informants unless the SACs, rightly or wrongly, believe the Headquarters

expects a certain caseload of ghetto informants from their respective

ottices.

The suspicion that it is the caseload concept which underlies

much of the current discussion about the ghetto informant program in

the aftermath of the recent inspection of DID is increased by the proposed

cutback of fifty percent, which, as previously indicated, appears to be

a somewhat arbitrary figure.

You should know in advance what the consequences would be as

far as the budget is concerned if the ghetto informant program, which

has undoubtedly accounted for a significant number of cases, were dis-

continued. If those consequences include a drastic cut in funds, you of

course can not be oblivious to them, but, at the risk of sounding naive,

I would hope that the future of this program can be decided solely on the

basis of the program's merit or lack thereof without regard to the case-

load factor.

Re Dave Kinley's note about our discussing this matter,

I believe I heard at the SAC Conference on 9/26 that DID was going

to poll the Field to get the views of SAC's and I got the impression

that DID, upon receipt of these comments from the Field, might

wish to revise the proposed SAC Memorandum which was the

subject of the 9/8/72 memorandum from Mr. Moore to you.

If there is to be a revised proposal from DID in light of

comments from the Field and the comments of Mr. Gray, it may

be that our discussion would take a substantially different form than

it it occurred now. Therefore, I suggest that the meeting contemplated

by Mr. Kinley not occur until after you have had a chance to poll the

Re: Venceremos Brigade

105-195696

The passport file review conducted in all VB cases usually

indicated a Social Security number.

The NIC stops for

questioning only are for the exclusive use of the Dureau

and the fact that sucu stops may be placed should

not be made

known outside the Bureau.

Stops should be plnced within

30 days frol the date of

this airtel.

Although informant coverage for the recond

and

third contingents of the VB was considered adequate, there is

a continuing need for Bureau sources within the VS at a

policy-making level. Efforts should be intensified to recruit

informants who are members of the National Committee of the VB

in order that the Bureau may be informed in advance of policy

decisions of this Castro-oriented group.

Information has come to the Bureau's attention which

indicates that the Cuban Government is exercising more control

to organization policies and activities and

sclection of

individual members of the VB.

Every effort must be nade to

obtain proof of violations of the laws of the U.S, by members

the VB or by members of the Cuban Government

acting in

concert with the VB. All offices should be aleit

for violations

ot the foreign agents Registration act, oi the various

espionage statutes, and of the various laws administered by the

Internal. Revenue Service relating to funds for orgauirationg

such as the VB, and intensive investigations of possible

violations should be conducted from a prosecutive staudpoint.

ofrices, advising fiald to submit stop nottoes for

Identification Division and NCIC, concerning Venceremos Brigade

(VB) subjects whose whereabouts are not known, as well as

requesting field to furnish statistical data concerning

Security Index (SI) status of VB subjects.

BACKGROUND:

By airtel dated 5/15/70, the field was instructed

to intensify investigations of VB

subjects including interview,

placing such subjects on the SI when warranted, and to follow

these subjects for a period of one year in order to determine

their long-range role in the revolutionary movement.

Since

approximately one year has expired since return of

first VB,

requirements for closing cases and furnishing statistical

data and recommendation of Inspection Division that subjects

be reinterviewed prior to case being closed, are included in

attached airtel.

REC 45 TE: 15656-1275

Inspection Division also recommended that stops be

placed with Identification Division and NCIC on those VB

subjects (approximately 115 in first and second VB groups)

who have not been located for intervier to date.

NCIC is

currently programing stops for "questioning only" which will be

completed in approximately 30 days.

NCIC stops must be

handled at Seat of Government and duplicate copies of the

Identification Division stops (FD-165) are being obtained IT iy/l

from field for purpose of placing NCIC stop when available.

SUBJECT:

STOP INDEX

NATIONAL CRIME INFORMATION CENTER (NCIC)

Đ.A2100

The Executives Conference, presided over by Mr. Tolson,

consisting of Messrs. DeLoach, Mohr, Bishop, Callahan, Casper, Conrad,

Felt, Gale, Rosen, Sullivan, Tavel, Walters, Beaver and Soyars, met in

your office today. Mr. Bishop proposed the establishment of a Stop Index

in the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) computer which would take

advantage of the surveillance capability of the NCIC, to which over 10 million

inquiries were directed in 1969 concerning persons arrested locally, suspicious

persons and vehicles observed in police operations. These observations of

persons and things can provide valuable intelligence intormation to the FBI

*and save a considerable amount of investigative time.

142-115784-1

The investigative divisions of the Bureau are interested in locating

suspects for interview, such as Selective Service delinquents, etc., but on

whom no warrant is outstanding; in any police contacts with Soviet Bloc cars

and personnel; in any police contacts with, or movement of, agitators; in

police contacts with Cosa Nostra members; and in the movements of criminal-

suspects such as bank burglars, sex perverts, etc. The identity of such

individuals or the license numbers of the cars used by them can be entered

into the NCIC computer. Should an inquiry be made by a police agency any-

where in the country with respect to these records, the NCIC computer

would advise the inquiring police agency "no warrant

i," "no want outstanding"

or "no stolen record." At the same time, the computer would advise a

monitor terminal located in the NCIC control room that an inquiry was

received, identifying the police agency, the time and the information used

to make the inquiry. This information would be furnished to the appropriate

investigative division which, in turn, would advise the field to follow up with

the inquiring agency as to the nature of the inquiry and whether the subject

is in custody. Each of the investigative divisions would establish the criteria

for entering a record into the Stop Index and all entries of Stop Index records

in the NCIC would be done through the NCIC control room for control purposes,

with no entries being made directly by the field office an aT out a Pa

Memo for Mr. Tolson

RE: Stop Index

National Crime Information Center (NCIC)

In order to program (instruct) the NCIC computer to handle such

a Stop Index for the FBI, it would cost approximately $1320 of employee

time. Computer storage is available and would not be extensive since it is

estimated by the investigative divisions that the Stop Index file would not

exceed 10, 000 entries during the first year.

It was the unanimous opinion of the Conference that the above-

I proposed Stop Index in the NCIC should be established.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

That the Domestic Intelligence, Special Investigative, General

Investigative, Administrative and Crime Records Divisions work out the

necessary details to place the Stop Index into effect, with criteria and

procedures for implementing the program to be sent through for approval.

subjects the file will continue to expand and the number of inquiries

will increase. In order to insure that only those individuals meeting

the approved Stop Index criterion are entered, the appropriate substantive

Division at Headquarters should review and approve all requests prior

to actual entry with the exception of Selective Service delinquents. If

the request for entry is approved, a copy of the request should be so

noted and routed to the Voucher-Statistical Section.

A new form (ED-15T) has been designed and approved for

entry,_ modification and cancellation of a Stop Index record. The form

will be used for all authorized categories with the exception of Selective

Service cases which will continue to be processed from a copy of the

FD-165 (Wanted-Flash-Cancellation Notice) which is prepared for the

Identification Division.

:.

With the exception of Selective Service delinquents, the

appropriate substantive Division at Headquarters must approve all

individuals and velicles before they are entered into the Stop Index

File. Therefore, communications requesting entry of a record must

"be directed to the attention of the appropriate Division.

A new form (FD-457) has been developed that will

accommodate entry, modification, and cancellation of Stop Index File

records. A sample of the FD-457 is attached. The form is self-

explanatory. A supply of these forms will be furnished to each field

office.

For Selective Service delinquents, the field should continue

to use the Wanted-Flash-Cancellation Notice (FD-165). One copy

should be designated for the Voucher-Statistical Section, Computer

Systems Division, rather than National Crime Information Center

(NCIC). The Special Investigative Division does not have to approve

Selective Service delinquents prior to their entry.

Rememo from N. F. Stultz to Mr. Campbell 9/11/73

enclosing a draft prepared by the Law Enforcement Assistance

Administration (LEAA) of proposed security and privacy regulations

governing criminal justice information systems funded by LEAA.

It was requested that comments of interested Divisions be

furnished to the Computer Systems Division.

That portion of the regulations which would affect

Intelligence Division (INTD) operations, in that it would place

restrictions on the use of the Stop Index, is included in

which relates to criminal intelligence information

Section "'"Criminal intelligence information" is defined as

"any information contained in a criminal justice information

system and indexed under an individual's name, or retrievable

by reference to an individual by name, or otherwise associated

with an identifiable individual, other than criminal offender

record information."

Section 7

reads, in part, "Information

regarding an individual may be entered into a

criminal intelli-

gence information system only if reasonable cause exists to

believe that the individual has committed a criminal amense for

which the maximum penalty provided by applicable law excéeds/84-35

six months' imprisonment."

ST.708

REC 43

120 OCT 26 1973

The Bureau's Stop Index would presumably beneategorizer

as a criminal intelligence information system.

INTD matters

contained in the Stop Index include individuals in Category I of

the ADEX; urban guerrilla warfare suspects; Venceremos Brigade

members;

Medburg case individuals; Weatherman suspects,

including the known false identities used by them; and license

numbers of vehicles used by official personnel attached to

communist-bloc establishments in the United States. In many:

instances these matters do not fit the criteria for entry as

outlined in Section 7 of the proposed regulations.

RECOMMENDATION FOR DISCONTINUANCE

hone Rm..-

Disedtor Sec'y -

By memo M. F. Row to Mr. Soyars 5/1/73, it was recommended

and approved that captioned program be evaluated semiannually beginning with

the period 12/31/73. The field offices have now submitted their first six-months

reports. The Intelligence Division, General Investigative Division and Special

Investigative Division have analyzed the reports coming from the field and a

memo from each of these Divisions setting forth the results of this analysis is

attached.

The great majority of the field offices felt that the Stop Index has

great potential and a substantial number cited positive results from its use.

Most of them recommended the continuance of the Stop Index program; however,

a few expressed doubt as to whether the program should be continued and two

recommend outright that the Stop Index program be discontinued. Albuquerque,

Dallas and Philadelphia felt that the danger of losing public support for NCIC

shouldthe existence of Stop Index become known overshadowed the benefits of

the program. It was pointed out that the now defunct Counterintelligence

Programs (COINTELPROS) became known to the public despite caveats designed

to protect their in-house nature.

i'll is

Several field offices made recommendations to expand the categories

included in the Stop Index. Others made recommendations to eliminate some

categories. Still other field offices recommended some minor changes to the

program. None of these suggestions will be considered at this time pending a

decision as to whether the Stop Index program is to be continued.

REG-8 in

The General Investigative Division advised that they felt the Stop Index

was invaluable with bank robbery suspects and the Top Thief Program. They

indicated they were considering expansion of the information entered into the

Stop Index.

Re: Stop Index Program Evaluation

Recommendation for Discontinuance

and 17 hits respectively concerning bank robbery suspects. On one occasion

a hit was useful in determining the death of a bank robbery subject who was

at that time being sought for interview. On a second occasion a bank robbery

suspect was located as a result of a hit and thereafter admitted his participation

and that of other individuals in two separate bank robberies. The General

Investigative Division believes that the Stop Index is a valuable investigative

aid with great intelligence potential and should, therefore, be continued.

The Special Investigative Division advised that in one of the more

important areas (Organized Crime Figures and Top Echelon .. Criminal

Informants) less than a dozen instances were cited of Stop Index "hits" producing

positive results with only two examples set forth in detail. More than 20 Selective

Service subjects were located and interviewed as a result of Stop Index "hits."

The Special Investigative Division believes the Stop Index has shown some promise

to date and if it can be retained without jeopardizing other Bureau operations

(such as NCIC) then it should be continued for another trial period of six months

with the field offices being instructed to maintain more accurate records so that

I a better evaluation can be obtained.

The Intelligence Division advises that Los Angeles cited three

examples of hits on subjects with close association with Weatherman activity

and these hits were of assistance in learning the whereabouts and activities of

these individuals. Boston cited four examples of hits on Revolutionary Activity

and Extremist subjects which resulted in determining their locations. Portland

also cited examples of positive results from Stop Index hits including one on a

missing Weatherman, resulting in his location. On this particular individual

over a dozen hits were received over a period of time from different parts of

the country and it is Portland's opinion that because of his nomadic nature his

whereabouts can only be ascertained through the continuation of the stop Index

program. The Intelligence Division advised there is no question that Stop Index

is a useful and cost-effective investigative tool but it is not a crucial tool - not a

technique that if taken away would seriously jeopardize the success of the overall

investigative responsibilities of that Division. They raised the issue of whether

we are on solid ground (1) in maintaining a computerized file essentially for -

intelligence purposes on individuals against whom warrants are not outstanding

- 2 -

and (2) in systematically running this file against all NCIC queries in an

attempt to develop further intelligence concerning these individuals which

would be of interest to us, this being a technique which is not available to

other users of NCIC. Intelligence Division's position is that if by continuing

the Stop Index NCIC operations would be jeopardized the Stop Index should be

After careful consideration of the comments of various field offices

and of the three Divisions who have analyzed the six-months results, it is my

firm belief that the Stop Index should be discontinued immediately for the

1. • A full disclosure of the existence of this file, which

must be recognized as a distinct possibility in our

present environment, would be a severe blow to FBI

credibility. We have stated categorically in writing

to Congress and others that we have no intelligence

data in our computer banks. While this is technically

true since the Stop Index data is maintained off-line

and off-line searches are made against NCIC activities

this would be a shallow argument with which to combat

criticism.

2. Although some positive results have been cited by

a few field offices and the majority believe there is

good potential in the continuance of the program there

have not been any substantial accomplishments at least

to the extent that would justify the risk we are running

in maintaining the program. Although the present

evaluation program only covered a six-months period

the Stop Index program has been in existence for several

years and if it was really going to result in major

accomplishments such should be evident by now.

Re: Stop Index Program Evaluation

Recommendation for Discontinuance

3. Provisions of the Security and Privacy Bill

being introduced by the Attorney General and

similar bills being introduced by Ervin and others,

if passed, could throw doubt on the legality of the

Stop Index operation.

4. The cost in the Computer Systems Division of

operating the Stop Index program as it now exists

has been determined to be approximately $50, 000.

This does not take into consideration cost of the

substantive divisions at FBIHQ or costs in the various

field offices.

I strongly feel that the risks to our credibility far outweigh any

positive results of the Stop Index program. It is believed that a decision as

to whether the program should be continued should be made immediately since

in the Director's testimony before the House and Senate Committees on the

pending Security and Privacy Bill he could very well be asked questions whose

answers would involve the Stop Index program.

RECOMMENDATION: That the Stop Index program be immediately discontinued

Reference Sizoo to Brennan memorandum 8/5/70 advising

that former Special Agent Charles Stine contacted Mr. Sizoo from

Ohio seeking to establish liaison between the Commission staff

conducting investigation at Kent and the FBI. Stine was advised

that contact with the Bureau should be handled through established

headquarters channels.

Subsequent to this, Mr. James Arthur,

Administrative Officer of the Commission,

contacted Supervisor B. H.

Haynes, who has served as the point of contact with the Commission, .

and stated that Stine. had called Commission headquarters in

Washington with request that inquiry be made of the FBI concerning

photographic coverage of the Kent State disorders. The Bureau's

reports were furnished to the. Commission at the direction of the

White House, are in the possession of the investigative team at

Kent, and, therefore, Arthur had some difficulty understanding

what

Stive wanted.

He asked if it would be satisfactory if Stine

called Haynes directly and was told this would be all right.

Stine called late in the afternoon of 8/5/70 and advised

that he had just joined

the Commission staff under Kenneth McIntire

that morning.

He is still trying to get his feet on the ground

but has several requests from McIntire. He stated that the

investigative reports contain references to photographs obtained

from students and other citizens and wanted to know it these

photographs would be available to the Commission as Mcintire felt

they would be helpful. He was advised that previous inquiry had

been made regarding these photographs and they had been furnished

to the Commission in Washington and he should contact Arthur in

this regard (this is in accordance with Wannall to Brennan memorandum

7/29/70 recommending that the additional photographs be furnished

Stine volunteered that the Commission is planning to

hold hearings on the Kent State affair commencing August 21st.

the location is not yet settled, but there is some feeling that

the hearings could create incidents if held at Kent so there is

some thought to holding them in Cleveland.

Stine stated that the

Conmission staff in reviewing the FBI reports were "flabbergasted"

that the Bureau had done such a big job in such a short time.

¡ The Bureau reports are most helpful and they are not going to try

"to re-cover the same ground but are going to try to look into aspects

Ithe disturbance on May 4th. He asked if the Commission staff should

develop information not covered in the Bureau's reports, would the

Bureau wish to be advised of this. He was told that any information

which they develop which he believes might fall within the Bureau's

jurisdictional responsibilities, the Bureau would accept it.

Stine said that inasmuch as he was previously acquainted

with the Ohio State Patrol, he was assigned by McIntire to handle

Liaison with that organization. Upon briefing the head of the

State Patrol on his

assignment with the Commission, the head

of the

Patrol commented, "So you have joined the camp of the enemy."

Stile thought this was a most curious statement and wondered what

the basis of it could be. No comment at all was made

to Stine.

in this regard.

ACTION:

If approved, the Commission will be advised that the

Bureau does not have in its possession any IV film coverage of the

disorders and the Commission may wish to contact NBC and CBS in

This case concerns the shooting of students at

Kent State University (KSU) on 5/4/70.

The President's

Commission on Campus Unrest has prepared a 92-page report

containing their findings with regard to the burning of

the National Guard Armory at ISJ on 5/1/70 and the shooting

of students on 5/4/70.

press

release through whick they released the report to the

press

at 6:00 PM on 10/4/70, A copy is attached.

The

press release stated that the Commission

condemned as "intolerable" the violent actions of some

students and non-students at ISU and labeled as unnecessary

and unwarranted and unexcused the fusillade of gun fire by

Ohio National Guardsmen that killed four and wounded nine

students.

They concluded that the actions of some students

were violent,

dangerous, reckless and irresponsible but that

the danger which the guardsmn faced was not a danger which

called for lethal force anc did not justify the firing of

61 shots by the guardsmen.

The President's Commission report, a copy of which

is attached, does not make any ducrogatory reverances to the

FBI.

Nine references are made in the report to the FBI's

investigation.

These refercaces basically state that the

Commission reviewed 8000 pagod of FBI reports; that the

reports did not indicate the disturbances were planned by

Students for a Democratic Society (SDS); that SDS students

previously arrested in connection with the disturbances at

Kent State did not plan or direct the events on 5/1/70

through 5/4/70. It also stated that FBI reports indicated

a significant number of persons participating in the ROTC

fire were not students and that General Cantaburry told the

FBI his order to disperse the students on 5/4/70 was based.

RE:

KENFOUR

The Commission report stated four students

were killed and nine were wounded and it quoted from

FBI Laboratory reports the distances of each killed

and wounded student from the firing line.

The report

stated that the FBI

has located no evidence of sniper

fire.

The report also mentioned that the FBI had

collected 340 rocks weighing 175 pounds at the scene

of the shooting.

The Commission's report also includes

approximately 60 pages of photographs taken during

and after the shooting at KSU.

For the most part,

these are photographs collected in our investigation

and furnished to the Commission.

The Commission's press release noted that

its investigation at Kent State was especially sensitive

because a

State Grand July began proceedings in September

while the report was being prepared.

The State Grand

Jury is currently sitting and conducting hearings con-

cerning the kent State incidents.

Copies of FBI reports

were furnihed to the Ohio State Attorney General by the

Civil Rights Division.

1970

WASHINGION, D. C.; Oct. 3 - The President's Commission

on Campus Unrest today condemned as "intolerable" the

violent

actions of some students and nonstudents at Kent

State University and labeled "unnecessary, unwarranted

and inexcusable" the fusillade of gunfire by Ohio

National Guardsmen that killed four and wounded nine

students on the Kent State campus on May 4.

In a report released today by the White House,

the nine-member panel said that "the actions of some

students were violent and those of others were dangerous,:

reckless and irresponsible."

But the danger the

guardsmen faced "was not a danger which called for lethal

force," the panel said.

"The 61 shots by guardsmen

certainly cannot be justified."

The lessons learned from Kent State were drawn upon

in making its report issued September 26.

The special

report on the events at Kent State demonstrates vividly

that those lessons must be learned by the Guard, students,

police and faculty.

"The widespread student opposition to the

Cambodian

action and their general

resentment of the

National Guard's presence on the campus cannot justify

the violent and irresponsible actions of many students

during the long weekend"

stated the panel.

Even so, the Commission pointed ut there would

have been

no deaths if the guardsmen had not been

equipped with loaded M-1 rifles which are high. velocity

weapons with a horizontal range of almost two miles.

As

the quardsmen confronted the students, the

nine-man panel recalled "all that stood between the

guardsmen and firing was the flick of a thumb on a

safety mechanism and the pull of an index finger on a

trigger.

"The Kent State tragedy. must surely mark the last

time that loaded rifles are issued as a matter of course

to guardsmen confronting student demonstrators," said

the Commission.

"Kent State was a national tragedy," the Commission

said, but it was not a unique tragedy. "Only the magnitude

of the student disorder and the extent of students' deaths.

and injuries set it apart from the occurrences on numerous

other American campuses during the past few years."

The events at Kent State illustrate the necessity

for adopting the recommendations made in its general

report, said the Commission.

The Commission described in detail the events

of the first four days in May in Kent including wide-

spread disorder in the city of kent on May 1, and burning

on May 2 and disorderly rallies on May 3. The Commission

stated that "those who wreaked havoc on the town of

Kent, those who burned the ROIC building, those who

urged them on and applauded their deeds share the

responsibility for the deaths and injuries of May 4."

The Commission pointed out that the May 4 rally

began as a peaceful

assembly on the commons, the

traditiona site of student assemblies. They noted

that

even

if the Guard had the authority to prohibit

a peaceful gathering - a debatable proposition --

"the decision to disperse the

noon rally was a serious

The "timing and manner of the dispersal were

disastrous.

Many students were legitimately in the

area

as they went to and from class.

The rally was

held during the crowded noon-time lunch period, and

there was

no apparent impending violence,"

said the

report.

The Commission noted that only when the Guard

attempted to disperse the rally did some students react

violently. "Under these circumstances," the panel

continued, "the Guard's decision to march through the

crowd for hundreds of yards up and down a hill was

highly questionable. In fact, the Guard never did.

disperse the crowd... Guardsmen had been subjected to

harassment and assault, were hot and tired, and felt

dangerously vulnerable by the time they returned to

the top of Blanket Hill.

When guardsmen confronted the students, "it was

only too easy for a single shot to trigger a general

fusillade,"

the Commission said.

The panel noted that many students considered ithe

Guard's march from the ROTC ruins across the Commons

up Blanket Hill, down to the practice football field,

and back to Blanket Hill as a kind of charade: The

report told of tear gas cannisters tossed back and forth

to the cheers of the crowd, many of whom acted as if

they were watching a game.

"Guardsmen have claimed that they were under an

increasingly heavy barrage of rocks and other objects

as they advanced back up Blanket Hill, and that

students rushed toward them threateningly," the panel

said.

"Many indicated that they began firing when

-they heard one or some of their fellow guardsmen open.

fire."

The Commission stated that the closest student

killed was 85 yards from the Guard at the time of the

shooting. The closest of the nine wounded students

was 20 yards from the Guard.

"The Guard fired amidst great turmoil and con-

fusion, engendered in part by their own activities. But

the guardsmen should not have been able to kill so

easily in

the first place. The general issuance of

loaded weapons to law enforcement officers engaged in

controlling disorders is never justified except in the

case of armed resistance that trained sniper teams are

unable to handle. This was not the case at Kent State,

yet each guardsman carried a loaded M-1 rifle.

"No one would have died at Kent State if this

lesson had been learned by the Ohio National Guard."

In the preface to the report, the Commission noted.

that its task at Kent state was especially sensitive.

At the outset of the Commission's investigation, the

Kent incidents had not been placed before any grand

jury, either county, state or federal. During the

investigation, the Attorney General of Ohio announced the

convening of a state grand jury. The grand jury began

proceedings in September as the Kent report was being

prepared.

The ghetto informant program was instituted on 10/11/67,

to fulfill an urgent need to develop a network of "listening posts"

In the ghetto areas of our cities.

Ghetto informants are those

persons living or working in ghetto areas who could furnish

information concerning the potential for riots and violent civil

unrest.

As the field gained experience in the handling of these

informants, their value steadily increased. The "listening post"

concept was expanded and ghetto informants are now utilized to

attend public meetings held by extremists, to identify extremists

passing through or beating in the ghetto area, to identify

purveyors of extremist literature as well as given specific assign-

ments where appropriate. A valuable by-product of the ghetto

informant program has been their ability to furnish highly

significant criminal information.

In addition, our ghetto informant

program has been a proven reservoir of productive. extremist

informants who have been elevated from the ghetto informant ranks.

We currently operate 7,482 ghetto informant! * iése

informants are developed and handled by field agents regardless

of their assignment, whether it be criminal, extremist, of

security. During the recent inspection of the Domestic

Intelligence Division, it was concluded that a modified

ghetto informant program would streamline and improve the

efficiency of the existing program. This was to be achieved

by having only Special Agents assigned to extremist matters

handle ghetto informants and instructing the SACs to reduce

their ghetto informant numbers by 50 percent in order to

eliminate the less productive informants. To date this

modified program has not been approved.

As a result of the number of views expressed during

the SAC conference on 9/26/72, concerning the appropriate

utilization of ghetto informants, there is a need to obtain

concerning the

the opinion of all SAls before considering modifying the

existing program. Accordingly, there is attached an airtel to

all SACs with instructions to promptly analyze their ghetto

informant program and submit their recommendations concerning

the most efficient use of these informants in accordance to their

needs to fulfill their respective responsibilities in the

extremist field. Upon receipt of these views, a thorough review

will be made at FBI Headquarters and appropriate recommendation

that will best serve the needs

of all field offices will be

made.

BUDED

10/9/72

The Bureau is currently considering modifying the ghetto

informant progran for the purpose of achieving greater efficiency

and maximum utilization of these informants while carefully preserv-

ing the "listening post" concept of the program.

One proposed change to the ghetto informant program

recommends a reduction in the number of these informants by fifty

percent and the handling of these informants exclusively by Special

Agents assigned to extremist matters.

This proposal emphasizes

quality and the closing, where appropriate, or redesignation of

chose informants best suited as extremist, criminal or security

informants.

The proposed modification of the ghetto informant program

Was discussed during the 9/26/72 session of the Special Agent in

Charge (SAC) conference held at FBI Headquarters. A number of

opinions were expressed as to the value of ghetto informants in

enabling each office to fill its responsibility in the extremist

field.

It was agreed that further study of the program is necessary

before initiating any modification of the program.

For your ready reference, our ghetto informant program

follows guidelines set out in Bureau airtel to Albany dated 11/24/71,

Äirtel to All Field Offices

Re: Ghetto Informant Program

captioned "Upgrading Extremist Ghetto Informant Program."

This airtel requires that ghetto informants be the type of

individuals who can obtain information concerning black

extremists who are operating in the ghetto areas and planning

or perpetrating guerrilla-type activities such as robberies,

attacks on police, and other violent activities. Our current

ghetto informant program requires that these informants be

given positive assignments and that they be evaluated on a

yearly basis in order to close the unproductive informant.

To assist the Bureau in determining what changes,

if any, should be made to the existing ghetto informant

program, you are instructed to carefully analyze your ghetto

informant program in line with the following points and sub-

mit your recommendations to reach the Bureau by 10/9/72.

Bear in mind our purpose

is to have a uniform program to

best do the job intended:

1) Retain current program without modification.

2) Adopt the proposed change set out above calling

for a fifty percent reduction in the number of ghetto

informants. Should you disagree with the fifty percent

reduction, submit your recommendation concerning the

percent of reduction you consider appropriate with an

explanation as to how you arrived at your conclusion.

Bear in mind that quality is difficult without

quantitative measurement.

3) Other changes believed necessary.

4) Abolish the ghetto program in its entirety.

If you recommend the program be abolished, submit

specific alternate program you recommend to obtain

the intelligence information now being developed by

ghetto informants.

This is to advise that instructions issued by

Mr. Gray on the memorandum from Mr. Daniel M. Armstrong III

to Mr. Gray dated September 18, 1972, concerning captioned

program are being complied with.

Mr. Armstrong's memorandum set out observations

concerning the ghetto informant program based on the recommenda-

tion set forth in memorandum dated September 8, 1972, from

G. C. Moore to Mr. E. S. Miller that the ghetto informant pro-

gram be modified.

This modification included reducing the

number of ghetto informants by 50 percent and instructing each

Special Agent in Charge to carefully analyze the current ghetto

informants and to retain those informants with the best potential

and to either elevate other informants to probationary

extremist

informants or, if appropriate, redesignate as criminal

informants

or discontinue.

Mr. Gray stated, 'WI

will not buy a meat-axe reduction.

Let's go into this thoroughly.

Submit recommendations."

The ghetto informant program was the topic of a lively

discussion at the September 26, 1972 Special Agents in Charge

conference held at FBI Headquarters. Various opinions were

expressed concerning the most efficient utilization of this

program and it was agreed that further study of the program

The purpose of the memorandum is to secure

approval of a letter to all offices modifying instructions

concerning the ghetto informant program.

A survey of all field offices relative to the

ghetto informant program has been completed.

The field overwhelmingly expressed a desire to

continue the program; however, a number of suggestions were

offered to modify certain aspects of it.

the following recommendations are made:

Based upon a review of the results of this survey Cle

1) The number of informants operated under this

program should definitely be governed by the needs of a

specific office as determined by the Special Agent in Charge

(SAC). Attached letter will instruct each office to conduct

an analysis to determine its needs and only those informants

absolutely necessary to fulfill the needs of the office are

to be operated.

The letter will also instruct that this

program is not to be utilized as a device to increase the

office case load.

about equally divided as to whether these informants should

security matters or by all Agents in the office. Attached

4) We, recommend that the name of this program

be changed from "ghetto informant" to urban, informant!' as

more properly descriptive. Tt has been mentioned that

some offices actually do not have "ghetto" areas but do

have certain geographical locations of potential civil

unrest and extremist activity.

As of September 1, 1972, we were operating 7,482

ghetto informants.

It is not possible to determine at this

time the number of these informants that we will end up with

based on the instructions set forth in attached letter.

However, we anticipate a decrease from the existing level.

OBSERVATION: There have been a variety of opinions expressed

In the past on the value of the ghetto informant program and,

in fact, we have utilized a discussion of this program to

"warm up" Agent conferences and in-service classes because

of the lively discussion it generates.

The recently completed

survey, however, shows that only four offices were in favor

of doing away with the existing ghetto informant program.

It is obvious

that this program 1s considered to be of con-

tinuing value to our field offices.

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re:

Ghetto Informant Program

It has been said that there has not been a single

instance where a ghetto informant has furnished significant

information pertaining to civil unrest. This is a mis-

conception because, in fact, since the inception of this

program there have been numerous times that these informants

have furnished significant information concerning civil

unrest.

Examples of a few of these are as follows:

A Memphis ghetto informant identified four Negro

males who had assaulted and stabbed a high school teacher

which lead to their arrest and resulted in the quieting

of a potentially riotous situation. A Minneapolis ghetto

intormant identified participants involved in a disturbance

at the University of Minnesota. A Jackson ghetto intormant

provided pertinent information concerning a disturbance at

Jackson State College and identified four individuals

setting fires on the campus.

This informant also identified

individuals leading a mob of 100 persons attacking the

Reserve Officer Training Corps Building on that campus.

Ghetto informants of the Knoxville Office furnished informa-

tion on black extremists extorting money from white merchants

with the threat of fire bombing their stores if they failed

to cooperate. A Norfolk ghetto informant furnished informa-

tion that a gathering of 200 young blacks had 40 fire bombs

which they intended to use. Local authorities credited this

information with avoiding a massive civil disturbance. A

Springfield ghetto informant identified an individual attempt-

ing to sell a large quantity of explosives for use in creating

a civil disturbance.

A Tampa ghetto informant identified five

• Negroes responsible for provoking trouble at a local school.

• In addition, ghetto informants have furnished a

large amount of valuable criminal information which is perhaps

best highlighted by a recent case wherein a ghetto informant

of the Oklahoma City Office furnished the information which

lead to the identification and apprehension of four subjects

in a terrorist-type slaying of a man, his wife, and a young

son.

ADDENDUM OF THE INSPECTION DIVISION L. M. WALTERS:wmj 10/24/

Ghetto Informant Program instituted 10/11/67 to fulfill a need

then recognized to develop a comprehensive network of "listening posts"

in the ghetto areas of urban centers throughout the country. Over the

succeeding years number of such informants has gradually built to some

7500 existing today. Field inspections in past year have pointed to diffic Its

of evaluating justification for such informants because, unlike the other

informant programs (criminal, security, extremist, revolutionary

activities, and top echelon) the justification for an individual informant

cannot be supported by what he is producing. It is sufficient that ghetto

informants are geographically well dispersed and promise cooperation.

The practice of opening such cases varies widely and can be used by a

field office to effect sharp changes in total case load upward or downward.

The number of ghetto informant cases substantially affects manpower

utilization in that each ghetto informant opened requires a background

investigation and thereafter 30-day contacts.

Accordingly, during inspection (8/18 - 9/1/72) of Domestic

Intelligence Division (DID) the merits of the overall program were

thoroughly reviewed and discussed. As a result, DID proposed in inspection

that hereafter assignment of such informants be limited to those Agents

assigned to extremist squads or extremist work and that SACs be instructed

to cease levying a requirement that all Agents, regardless of assignment,

must develop and operate ghetto informants. DID estimated that such a

change in the program would probably reduce the total number of such cases

by 50%.

The proposed letter to the field accomplishes little meaningful

change. It changes the name of the program; it provides latitude to SACs

to determine extent of program within guideline that the number of

informants operated must be deemed necessary to fulfill the needs of the

brade ened

office (this has always been so); it also provides latitude to SACs as to

whether all Agents in the office participate or only those Agents assigned to

extremist matters. Implementation of changes proposed herein would

result in an extraordinary lack of uniformity throughout the field.

The point really called into question here is whether concrete

steps should be taken to effect an overall case load reduction by sharply

reducing marginally productive cases in order to divert Agent manpower

to more productive uses in major program areas. The broader question

is currently under consideration and the results of that consideration should

HH 55179 DoOId: 32989648

Page 446

---

## Page 447

more clearly dictate the proper approach to the Ghetto Informant

Program. Accordingly, it is recommended that any change in this

program be deferred until the overall question of case load vs.

manpower utilization is resolved.

Re memo of G. C. Moore to Mr. E. S. Miller of 10/18/72

on this subject.

The first paragraph of the Addendum of the Inspection Division

sets forth some of the considerations which have caused my skepticism

as to whether the benefits gained from this Program are sufficient to

justify the costs in terms of resource utilization attendant to the Ghetto

Informant Program.

With reference to the recommendation of the Inspection Division

that no action be taken until the overall question of caseload versus man-

power utilization is resolved, I am not certain as to the precise inquiry

currently in progress which is being referred to by the Inspection Division.

If there is such an inquiry with a view towards instructing. the Domestic

Intelligence Division not to let fears as to the consequences of a reduction

in the quantity of its total caseload interfere with devoting concentrated

attention towards the most important matters within its jurisdiction, I

would be the first to applaud this inquiry.

In this regard, the problem I see with the proposed letter of

the Domestic Intelligence Division is that by giving wide latitude to SACs

to administer the Ghetto Informant Program within their respective offices,

the memorandum is not likely to accomplish meaningful change as long as

so much turns within the Bureau on the total caseload of an office.

Even

though an SAC in Field Division X believes that he could terminate his

Ghetto Informant Program altogether and, by doing so, increase the

effective utilization of his personnel, he will hesitate to make such a

decision because he knows it could well result in a substantial reduction

in his total caseload, which in turn would mean that his office would lose

Agents and/or supervisors or would not be able to obtain additional Agents

and/or supervisors.

Re: Ghetto Informant Program

Extremist Matters

This is why it seems so vitally important to achieve the

by no means easy goal of finding some way to measure the needs of an

office without resort to dependence upon the total caseload of the office

because the present reliance upon caseload figure restricts the SACs

ability to make decisions, otherwise called for, which would reduce

his total caseload.

The Domestic Intelligence Division furnished to me copies of

the responses received from the Field Divisions in connection with the

Field survey concerning the Ghetto Informant Program. The information

submitted by the Newark Division so closely approximates my opinion

concerning the Ghetto Informant Program that I am attaching a copy of

the Newark airtel to this memorandum.

A review of ghetto iniormant files in the Newark

Division following the guidelines set out in Bureau airtel

dated 11/24/71 captioned "UFGRADING EXTREMIST GHETTO INFORMANT

PROGRAM" has revealed the following:

Ghetto informants are divided into two general

groups.

The first group are those serving as "listening

posts". These informants are generally individuals who own

or are employed in such businesses as gas stations, candy

stores, barber shops,

etc. and are usually in no way directly

connected with extremist or criminal matters.

These Individuals

are contacted on a regular basis and routinely report that

"a1l is quiet in the neighborhood".

The value of such

informants is highly questionable.

Civil disturbances are either planned or spontaneous.

In the first case, such planning is done by various militant

It is the

responsibility of all flold offices to

have developed infornants of such character in these groups

that they are in a position to furnish advance information

about such plans.

"Listening post" Informants are not in &

position to furnish intormation about preplanned disturbances

and they certainly cannot furnish prios information relative to

a Spontaneous discurrance.

Onco & disturbance or riot has

started, it is virtually impossible to contact these individuals

lunsnuch as most connercial enterprises are closed down and

entry into these areas is not teasible and the ability of these

informants to report by telephone 1s very doubtful.

Targeting of such informants towards obtaining

information concerning black extremiate, robbertes, attacks on

police and other violent accivities, as

well as recent targeting

cowards obtaining narcotics information has been extrenely iimited

11n 1ES VaIUO.

In vow of this, it is felt that the value of

the "Ilstening post" is limited and they should be eliminated.

The manner in which this action should be taken is set out later

in this connunication.

The second group consists of those individuals opened

as ghetto informants who are considered to have definite value

in the extremist field and who are targeted to furnish specilie

information relative to extrenist organization and individuaig.

These informants sre actually under development towards becoming

extronist informants. They are generally individuals who are

presently menbers of extromist organizations or are in some way

airillated with those organizations through contact with nembers.

These ghetto informants are of great value for the continued

development of new informants in the extrenist field. In the

Newark Division 1t is this group of ghetto informants who have

furnished positive iniornstion relative to extremist activities,

as well as contributing information rolative to lugitives, bank

robberies and local criminal matters. They are sil targeted

towards furnishing information relative to narcotics activity.

and it is anticipated that they will be of great value in this

izeld.

These ghetto informants

are of definite valua and in

the Newail Division are all assigned to Agents conducting

oxtremist investigations.

Tho Newark Division disagroes with arbitrarily

closing firty percent of all ghetto informants.

The following

15 Newark's recommendation as to how ench ghetto ilorzans

should be evaluated:

The Extremist Informant Coordinator or Supervisor,

83

the esso applies, routinely reviows all files under the

tickler system.

AS

a file comes up on tickler for revier,

it should be evaluated.

I1 is appears to be a "listening post"

with so value as a future extremist informant, this should be

brought to the attention of the case Agent.

This Agent should

then within one nonth make a reconmendation to either close this:

informant or convert hin to a criminal or gecurity informant

¡or development in a specific ares.

All ghetto informants

considered to be of no other value than as "listening posts"

should be closed.

In the Newark Office ghetto Informants are assigned

to the extremist squad or security squads, the applicant and

accounting squads.

Those assigned to other than the extreuiet

squad are generally "Itstening posts" in character. Upon

raview, is set forth above, il it is determined the informant is

of value in the extremist field he should be reassigned to an

Agent porking extremist matters.

I1 of value in another field

of investigation, he should ba appropriately reassigned..

It is felt that it the above is

adopted, a great deal

of Agent time and clerical time would be saved and could be

diverted to more productive and efficient usage, particularly

oy the Agento conducting investigationg in the extremist, security

and criminal fiolds.

Further, concentration on the remainder

of the informants would logically result in their becoming more

produetiva and efficient.

Mrs. Neenan -

In connection with various memoranda concerning captione

matter, Mr. Gray inquired "Why not handle this program in same mann

as our other programs involving informants? G III 11/9 2:34 P

The question asked is similar to the questions raised at

the time the captioned program was inaugurated in October, 1967.

Faced with the need for a rapid development of a particular type of

informant, the decision was made to implement

a program with a

minimum amount of Headquarters'

supervision.

i. "Accordingly, authority

was granted for the Special Agents in Charge (SAC) to approve the

operation of an individual as a ghetto informant.

Program is in line with other Bureau informant programs in that ther

are specific guidelines for the operation of the informants, as well

as requirements for the justification of the informants and

requirements for contacts with these informants along with the

regulations concerning payments to informants.

There are also set forth observations concerning the

comments made by Mr. Armstrong in his memorandum of November 2, 1972,

and the comments made by the Inspection Division in its addendum

of 10/24/72.

Need for the Ghetto Informant Program

s. telfor

In 1967 the United States experienced violent racial

disturbances in many cities and it was indicated that there was a

need for cooperative individuals (sources) in those areas

experiencing the above disturbances. Such questions as "Are these

disturbances spontaneous or are they planned?" "Are these dis-

turbances caused by organizations or individuals? If so, identify

them" were being asked not only by FBI Headquarters officials, it

also by high-ranking coverment ofelials including the white paod.

Memorandum to Mr.

RE: GHETTO INFORMAN

S. Miller

PROGRAM

Analysis of the then existing Security, Criminal and Extremist

Informant Programs determined that none of these existing programs could

supply the answers to the questions being asked..:

The above analysis further showed that due to the orientation

of the various informant programs mentioned above, that is, criminal

informants to obtain criminal information, security informants for

security information, and extremist informants for specific information

concerning extremist organizations and known extremist individuals,

there was still a vast area where racial unrest was rampant, namely, the

ghetto areas where there was a need for a "listening post" type

intormant. Accordingly, the Ghetto Intormant Program was

s instituted.

Comparison of Ghetto Informant Operations With Other Bureau Informant

Operations

The Security Informant Program as well as the Extremist

Informant Program require tight supervision at both Headquarters and

field level because of the extreme sensitivity of these operations.

As

previously stated, there was a need for development and rapid operation

of sources in the ghetto areas which were to be utilized as "listening

posts." In view of the nature of this operation, it was decided that the

tight supervision required by the other informant programs was not

necessary, however, it was also recognized that for any program to be

fruitful and administratively sound, there must be guidelines set out..

The guidelines formulated were based on our experiences with

the Security and Extremist Informant Programs and required that some

background checks be conducted prior to the approval of an individual as

an informant; a contact be made with the individual designated as an

informant at least once every 30 days; that any payments made to a ghetto

informant must be in accordance with Bureau policy which is also the

requirement for other informant programs.

In synopsis, it can be said that the Ghetto Informant Program

is similar to other informant programs (security and extremist) in that

there are definite guidelines set

for the designation and operation of

an individual as

a ghetto informant, as well as the fact payment to these

informants must conform to Bureau regulations. In short, the Ghetto

Informant Program, although operated basically as other informant

programs, does serve a separate and distinct need which our experience

has shown the other Bureau informant programs did not and could not

fill.

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

RE:

GHETTO INFORMANT PROGRAM

Comparison of the Justification of Ghetto Informants With

Justification of Other Existing Informant Programs

In the Inspection Division's addendum dated 10/24/72 to

the memorandum from G. C. Moore to E. S. Miller dated 10/18/72

concerning captioned matter, it was set out "Field inspections

in past year have pointed to difficulty of evaluating

justification for such informants (this refers to ghetto

intormants) because, unlike the other informant programs

(criminal, security, extremist, revolutionary activities, and

top echelon) the justification for an individual informant

cannot be supported by what he is producing."

The Inspection Division's difficulties have not previously

been brought to the attention of the Domestic Intelligence

Division (DID), however, this Division does not agree with the

above set out difficulty.

The statistical accomplishments of the ghetto informants

have been set out numerous times, therefore, this in itself would

assist in making a justification

for ghetto

• informants; but,

it is more important that the ghetto informants be justified

by obaining information concerning potential civil unrest.

This must be considered in light of present circumstances.

While we are not experiencing the burning of the cities that

we did in the late 1960s, we are still living in a state of

verong to donal feare concernine e polarstion of tha nacos

Therefore, based on our experiences, we recognized

that in reporting on the pulse of a particular area in regard

to the potential for civil unrest it is very important to

know that there is no indication of civil unrest in a particular

area at a particular time, as well as knowing that there are

indications of civil unrest. Accordingly, the report that there

is no indication of civil unrest in a particular area is

considered positive information and should be counted as such.

In accordance with these guidelines, there does not appear to

be any difficulty in justifying the continuance of a ghetto

In addition to the above, there will be set forth

observations concerning the comments made in the memorandum

of Mr. Armstrong dated November 2, 1972, as well as the

addendum of the Inspection Division dated 10/24/72.

Addendum of Inspection Division dated 10/24/72

Paragraph one of the above addendum in addition to the

comment concerning the difficulty of evaluating justification

for the Ghetto Informant Program which was answered above

makes reference to the practice of opening ghetto cases and

states these cases can be used by a field office to effect

sharp changes in total case load upward or downward. This

is merely an administrative matter and should not be considered

in connection with the concept of whether or not there should be

a Ghetto Informant Program.

The value of this program has been

previously set forth in connection with the obtaining of

intelligence information and will be repeated further in this

memorandum.

The above-mentioned addendum sets out that DID's

proposed letter to the field dated 10/20/72 accomplishes little

meaningful change in the Ghetto Informant Program. This is

exactly what the DID intended. DID's letter to the field was

based on the observations of the SAls and was a consensus of

their studied critique of the program and their respective

recommendations. As a result of discussion with SACs and

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

RE:

GHETTO INFORMANT PROGRAM

Mr. Gray concerning the Ghetto Informant Program on 9/26/72,

all SACs were instructed to submit their comments and

recommendations concerning this program. If we are not going

to take the recommendations of the SACs, who are our leaders

In the field, then why did we bother to request their opinions?

Likewise, they certainly are entitled to know the results of

the survey and this is what we are attempting to do.

In connection with the recommendation made that any

change in this program be deferred until the overall question

of case load versus manpower utilization is resolved, there

apparently is no indication as to when this will be resolved

and further, this question should not be the deciding factor

as to whether or not there should be a Ghetto Informant Program.

Memorandum of Mr. Daniel M. Armstrong. III dated November 2, 1972

Mr. Armstrong stated that in connection with the

inquiry concerning the overall question of case load versus

manpower that if there is such an inquiry with a view toward

instructing DID not to let fears as to the consequences of a

reduction in the quantity of its total case load interfere

with devoting concentrated attention towards the most important

matters within its jurisdiction, he would be the first to

applaud this inquiry.

In respect to this, DID is not aware of any fears in

connection with the above case load work load inquiry and,

further, we will always go full steam ahead to obtain the

maximum quality intelligence data needed to fulfill our

responsibilities to the United States Government, regardless

of any alleged "fears."

Mr. Armstrong stated that the problem he sees with

DID's proposed letter of 10/20/72 is that "by giving wide

latitude to SACs to administer the Ghetto Informant Program

within their respective offices, the memorandum is not likely

to accomplish meaningful change as long as so much turns

within the Bureau on the total caseload of an office."

OBSERVATIONS:

The Ghetto Informant Program since 1967, when it was

instituted, has been analysed and critiqued not only by FBI

Headquarters personnel, SACs, but also by Field Supervisors and

Field Informant Coordinators through a series of correspondence,

as well as specialized conferences. The overriding opinion

of the majority of individuals involved in the above has

been that this program has in the past and still is an

• effective productive program. The program serves a vital

need, that is, the need to know the potential for acts of

civil disturbances that could not only disrupt the operations

in local communities, but could also cause disruption on a

nationwide basis.

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

RE:

GHETTO INFORMANT PROGRAM

As previously stated, the country is not experiencing

the burning of the cities and

the major riots as we had in the

late 1960s, however, there are movements in this country that

are more dangerous

than the riots of the late 1960s. We are

familiar with the rhetoric of known extremists such as

Stokely Carmichael, Eldridge Cleaver, LeRoi Jones, and

unfortunately this rhetoric is the fact of life in our country

today. These extremists preached the theory of "kill the

pig," and we are seeing today not only known extremists

actively waging guerrilla warfare against the establishment

(the pigs) but we are also seeing individuals not affiliated

with extremist organizations taking this same action.

The above article sets out the hostility of racial

factions in the military which has caused military leaders to

declare it a threat to our national security. It further

points out the tensions and violence that exist in our high

schools and states that traditional white racism has collided

with a virulent new black nationalism to drive the races as far

apart as they have been in half a century, with an increasingly

destructive impact on the stability of our society.

As can be seen from

i the above, there is still a need

ADDENDUM OF THE INSPECTION DIVISION J.H. TRIMBACH:wmj 11/24/72

The attached series of documents arose from DID inspection review of

Ghetto Informant Program, 8/18 - 9/1/72. Inspection Division adheres to its

position expressed in addendum to 10/18/72 memorandum attached and still feels

that the proposed letter to the field contains no meaningful change in the

operation of the Ghetto Informant Program.

Under the heading, "Need for the Ghetto Informant Program, " in foregoing

memorandum (page 1, last paragraph), DID mentions questions such as "Are

these (racial) disturbances spontaneous or are they planned?", and "Are these

disturbances caused by organizations or individuals?", as questions asked by

high Government officials after the racial disturbances of 1967. Inspection Division

feels that advance information responsive to such intelligence needs must be

obtained from productive, well-placed Security, Revolutionary Activities, and

Extremist Informants, or as by-product information from Criminal Informants

and other sources from whom we have reasonable expectation of positive

information reporting based on past experience. Our current concept of

a Ghetto Informant includes the proprietor of a candy store or barber shop in

a ghetto (under new proposal in an urban area) who may or may not have

such information. One such proprietor could have significant information about

an impending racial disturbance and another may not. Can we assume that our

Ghetto Informant is the local proprietor with the answer because we have

selected him in the neighborhood as a listed Ghetto Informant?

Inspection Division feels that the Ghetto Informant Program as viewed by the

DID is different from all other informant programs in at least one highly

important respect. On page 3 of the memorandum, it is stated that the report

(from a Ghetto Informant) that there is no indication of civil unrest in a particular

area is considered "positive" information and should be counted as such. Negative

information is not counted as positive information in any other informant program

and in other programs we obtain some history of the furnishing of productive in-

formation before forming a conclusion that the individual is worthy of continued

contact or further development. If we accept the views of the DID, then every

Ghetto Informant opened by an office and established for monthly contact is

capable of furnishing "positive" information because everyone is capable of

saying they do not have information indicating civil unrest.

Some Ghetto Informants have in the past furnished information in extremist

or criminal matters. This has been recognized as a by-product of the Ghetto

Informant Program. A more meaningful approach to this whole problem might be

to concentrate more heavily in ghetto areas to develop proven Security, Extremist,

Revolutionary Activities, and Criminal Informants upon whom we can then rely to

keep us advised of civil disturbance plans as a steady by-product to the intormation

HH 55179 DocId:32989648 Page 461

## Page 462

in?

they are regularly furnishing on domestic intelligence or criminal matters.

Existing Ghetto Informants who have shown productivity in any area of FBI

jurisdiction should be converted to the appropriate substantive informant

program to which their services relate. Further, all informants designated

in the other informant programs who are strategically located in areas of

potential civil unrest, should be briefed on supplying information that may

come to their attention relating to develoing tensions and civil unrest. Such

approach would, in our view, represent a better ordering of priorities and not

have the "cart before the horse." Moreover, we have some concern of

justifiable apprehension that might be expressed by the Congress or the public

it this program were to be described in terms out of context with our real intentions.

We could fully defend informants providing us regularly with information directly

related to our jurisdictional responsibilities and using them for "by-product"

information on civil unrest.

It would be much more difficult to defend

establishment of ghetto or urban listening posts all over the country with a

possible by-product of information directly within our jurisdiction.

In our view, the Ghetto Informant Program is not a proven program and in

view of the manpower expended on it, the decision as to whether we should

keep it, modify it, or abolish it should be made after a decision is reached

concerning the overall question of case load vs, manpower utilization now pending

in connection with a separate management study.

Re memorandum from Mr. G. C. Moore to Mr. E. S. Miller,

dated November 20, 1972, on this subject and the addendum of the Inspection

Division thereto, dated November 24, 1972.

As noted in the addendum of the Inspection Division, the Urban

Intormant Program formerly known as the Ghetto Intormant rogram

difters from all other informant programs in that negative information is.

under this program, counted as positive information.

It would appear from Section 130 (H) (2) (b) (4) of the Manual of

Instructions that an urban informant who does nothing more than advise our

inquiring Agents that there is no indication of civil unrest in his particular

area could qualify for payments on a regular basis under Bureau authority.

In this regard, I believe it would be useful to know (1) how

many of the Bureau's present urban informants are being paid on a regular

basis, (2) of that number, how many have furnished only intormation to the

effect that there is no indication of civil unrest in their areas and (3) of

those urban informants not paid on a regular basis, are there documented

cases in which those informants have been paid for saying that there is no

indication of civil unrest in their areas?

The answer to Question (1) would appear to be readily available.

The answers to the other questions, especially lestion (2), might be

difficult to obtain.

If you deem it appropriate, I would be pleased to have you obtain

the answers to one or more of the above questions, or I would make the

effort myself. I would understand completely if you conclude that the ' s

request for this information should come only from Mr. Gray. y JAN IL i."3

SORBAN INFORMANT PROGRAM

One of the memoranda on this subject which was

included in the package which Mr. Deegan sent me at your

request was a memorandum of 12/5/72 from me to Mr. Kinley

upon which Mr. Gray had written - "Prepare a memo for my

signature requesting the info. G III 12-11 9:09A." The

information to which Mr. Gray was referring would be the

answers to three questions set forth in the body of the

memorandum.

In view of the fact that you are already in possession

of the memorandum containing the three questions and Mr.

Gray's instructions with reference thereto, I have suggested

to Mr. Kinley that the preparation of a memorandum for

Mr. Gray's signature would now be, under the circumstances

af this case, unnecessary. Mr. Kinley suggested that the

answers to those three questions could be compiled and made

available to Mr. Gray in conjunction with the overall project of

developing an Urban Informant Program which he also requested

in his notation of 12-11-72 at 9:11 AM

Therefore, I will not prepare a memorandum formally

requesting the answers to the three questions, and will assume

that the information will be furnished in connection with the project

we are now working on. Please advise if this suggested approach

presents any problems.

/re are the ate and Miter et on 22 017 men

which time they formulated a 'revised Extremist Informant

Program designed to be beneficial to the Bureau's

operation both in the field and at FBIHQ.

The new revised Extremist Informant Program

eliminates urban (ghetto) informants. and is limited to

potential extremist informants (PEI), extremist informants

(EI), and confidential sources-extremist (CS-E).

Definitions and qualifications for these new

informant categories are as follows:

Potential Extremist Informant:

A PEI is an individual who is in a position to

furnish information concerning extremist activities of

individuals and organizations as well as information of an

extremist nature in those geographical areas where there is

a potential for violence.

The personal authority of the SAC is necessary to

designate and operate an individual as a PEI with exceptions

as noted below. These informants are to be operated for a

period of not more than one year and not less than six months

providing their potential is such that it appears he will qualify

or elevation to El. The PEl must be discontinued immediately

rollowing a determination that he has no future potential as ar

EI and those PEIs not elevated at the end of one year must be

discontinued.

Memorandum to Mr. W. M. Felt

Re:

Extremist Informant Program

The following are exceptions to the SAC's authority

for granting the approval of the operation of a PEI. If any

of the following conditions exist, the SAC must submit his

recommendation to FBIHQ on a UACB basis:

1. Any individual in a sensitive position (i.e. news

media, educational field or any other field where disclosure

as an informant would cause concern to the Bureau).

2. Any individual being placed in an extremist

organization or any individual presently in an extremist

organization.

3. Any individual who has been charged with a

felony violation in the past five years.

4. Any individual who is presently under indictment

or is on probation or parole, Federal or local.

5. Any individual with an unsavory background yet

who, is in a position to furnish uniquely valuable information

not available from other sources.

The Special Agent in Charge has authority to

authorize payments to PEIs in the amount of up to $400.

Additional payment authority must be obtained from FBIHQ.

Bureau authority is necessary to elevate a PEI to

an il. Field recommendation must contain full justification.

If PEI does not qualify for EI within one year, he must be

discontinued.

Extremist Informant:

An EI is an individual who has been operated as a

PEI for at least six months (in order that his reliability can

be properly evaluated) and is furnishing extremist information

on a regular basis whether it be concerning an extremist

organization or an unaffiliated extremist. In order to elevate

a PEI to an EI, he must have produced authentic data on

extremist activities and be in a position to continue furnishing

extremist intelligence information.

Confidential Sources-Extremist:

A CS-E is an individual who is willing to cooperate

with the Bureau by furnishing extremist information brought

to his attention by virtue of his position in the community,

by his employment, of in view of his background in extremist

activities. This individual, whose identity must be protected,

will not be actively seeking information on behalf of the

Bureau.

OBSERVATIONS:

We contemplate no changes in the existing extremist

requirements as they pertain to background investigation,

payments, or other administrative policy.

Our present urban informants will be evaluated to

determine if they should be considered in the future as EIs,

PEIs, CS-E, directed to the Security or Criminal Informant

Programs, or discontinued altogether.

No individual will be operated as an EI or PEI solely

because he is in a "listening post" position. To insure we

have informant coverage in those areas where there is a potential

for violence, instructions will be issued to each SAC to insure

all Special Agent personnel are aware of the need for developing

information where there is a potential for violence and that

those Special Agents not directly involved with extremist

matters refer those individuals who may possess information of

potential violence to the Extremist Supervisor in order that

their informant potential may be assessed.

Re: Extremist Informant Program

The field will be instructed that CS-Es are not

to be kept in a pending status unless these sources are

furnishing information on a regular basis. Sources reporting

infrequently may be operated from a pending file with a

provision for closing after a fixed period of inactivity,

out of a dead file or out of a control file. Each SAC should

determine which method of operation is best suited for his

individual needs. SACs may desire to establish an informant

map which will clearly depict coverage in any geographical area

within their division.

Those informants currently carried as probationary

extremist informants should either be designated as PEIs

or elevated to EIs.

If the above revisions to the Extremist Informant

Program are approved, appropriate Manual changes will be made.

ADDENDUM

4/6/73

Mr. Gray in his instructions of 12/11/72, which led to the

aforementioned meeting of 2/20/73, said he was not persuaded that the

"listening post" concept continued to have merit. "It is," he said, "a

luxury that we cannot afford at the present." In view of the fact that the

"listening post" concept has up to now been a central feature of the Urban

(Ghetto) Informant Program, Mr. Gray's comments clearly contemplate

a major change in this program.

In order to insure effective implementation of the new policy,

it is therefore important that SAC's clearly understand that a major change

is intended. Unless the new policy is spelled out in unmistakably clear

terms, SAC's may understandably interpret the new policy as not repre-

senting a major change from the past.

The motivation for this kind of

interpretation is great because such an interpretation would be most

consistent with the maintenance of a high case load of urban (ghetto)

informants, and SAC's continue, I fear, to operate on the assumption

(erroneous I hope) that any significant decrease in their case loads,

regardless of the circumstances leading to the decrease, will automatically

mean a reduction in the number of Agents assigned to their Divisions, etc.

It is with the above in mind that I venture the following comments

on the proposed description of the revised Extremist Informant Program.

1. The revised policy statement should include language that

the revised Extremist Informant Program is designed to reduce substantially

the number of non-productive informants in the Urban (Ghetto) Informant

Program who have not provided positive specific intelligence concerning

extremist, security or criminal activities. The SAC's should be told that

careful and close attention must be given to insure that each informant

operating in the revised Extremist Informant Program is both in a position

to furnish and willing to furnish information of positive value to the Bureau

in the extremist area.

2. I would define a PEI simply as an individual who is in a position

to furnish information concerning extremist activities of individuals and/or

organizations. If we are covering both known individuals and organizations

with a potential for violence, "geographical areas where there is a potential

for violence" should automatically be covered. An additional reference to

"geographical areas...." is therefore unnecessary and could be confusing

ADDENDUM (Continued...)

to SAC's since they are told elsewhere that mere "listening posts" are no

longer to be operated.

3. It a PEl is defined as suggested in #2, it is not clear who else

would be left in the great majority of situations for an SAC to approve as a

PEl except an individual who is being placed in an extremist organization or

an individual who is presently in an extremist organization. Therefore,

requiring an SAC to submit a recommendation to FBI HQ before an individual

is approved as a PEI when the individual in question is being placed in an

extremist organization or is presently in an extremist organization, which

submission is required by condition #2 on page 2 of this memorandum, could

be tantamount to requiring notification to Headquarters in practically every

case.

This should not be necessary because the SAC seems to be in the best

position in the great majority of cases to make a final decision as to whether

a person should be operated as a PEI.

4. With further reference to those situations on page 2 of this

memorandum describing when the SAC must submit his recommendation of

a PEI to FBI HQ, there would appear to be very few candidates for a PEI

who have not been at least charged with felony violations. Therefore, the

fact that an individual has been charged with a felony violation in the past

five years seems of no great significance to the question whether that person

should be operated as a PEI, and the SAC should not be required to notify

FBI HQ when this situation arises. Thus, I would delete condition #3. With

specitic reference to condition #5, as presently worded, this condition seems

too broad and/or ambiguous. Practically speaking, couldn't anyone likely

to qualify as a PEI quite conceivably be described as a person with "an

unsavory background?" If so, this condition could have the effect of requiring

advance notification to FBI HQ in practically every situation, a result which,

as indicated above, I do not favor.

Finally, if FBI HQ is to be notified, as is

proposed by condition fl, when the individual is in a sensitive position, I

think the SAC should be given more specific guidance as towhat is considered

to be a sensitive position. The phrase "any other field where disclosure as an

informant would cause concern to the Bureau" is too vague.

Mr. Mintz -

Purpose is to respond to addendum of Mr. D. M.

"Extremist Informant Program."

Set forth below are comments concerning Mr. Armstrong's

observations:

1. Mr. Armstrong suggests the revised policy

should include language that the revised Extremist Informant

Program is devised to reduce substantially the number of

"nonproductive informants in the Urban (Ghetto) Informant

Program.

We believe this is clearly stated in our memorandm

to all SACs on page four, paragraph one "Under the revisea"

program no individual is to be operated as an ul or

PEI

solely because he is in a 'listening post' position."

2. Mr.

Armstrong proposed that he would define

a potential extremist informant (PEl) simply as an individual

who is in a position to furnish information concerning

extremist activities of individuals and/or organizations.

therefore, since we are covering both known individuals and

organizations with a potential for violence, there is no need

for a reference to

"geographical areas where there is a poten-

tial for violence."

The key to the weakness in Mr. Armstrong's

definition is the

statement

"covering both known individuals

and organizations with a potential for violence."

There are

many areas in the United States where known organizations and

known extremists do not operate. Nevertheless, there is a

potential for violence in these areas because of socio-economic

conditions that breed frustrations thereby making the individuals

Involved in these areas potential sparkplugs for extrenist

Consequently, our definition of a PEl must be broad

enough to enable informants to actively seek out this type of

information.

Re: Extremist Informant Program

3.

The observation that SACs have a better insight

in the great majority of cases to make a final decision as to

whether a person should be operated as a PEI in connection

with the placing of an individual in an extremist organization

is not accurate in each and every case.

It is pointed out

that extremist activity is nationwide

and individual FBI field

office files do not necessarily contain full information and

background concerning these organizations and the individuals

involved in these activities. Experience has shown that

Headquarters, after considering the sAC's recommendation.

1s in a better position to determine an individual's suit-

ability for operation as a PEI.

One of our greatest continuing

concerns is penetration of our informant ranks by extremist

"plants" as well as Agent provocateurs. Headquarters' review

percent fullproof,

in no way mitigates the SAC's responsibility as his

approval

and recommendation is necessary in the first instance.

4. With regard to the comment there would appear

to be very few candidates for PEI who have not been at least

charged with felony violations, it is stated that although

a great number of our informants have been charged with

violations, a felony charge in itself is not as frequent

as Mr. Armstrong believes.

A sampling of forty recently

approved PEIs shows that only seven of this forty had been

charged with a felony.

5. As to the observation concerning informants

naving an unsavory background. it is noted our present

regulations as set out in section 130, Volume IV, Manual Of

Instructions require that individuals

grounds who would not ordinarily be considered as Pils

Set forth below is a revised Extremist Informant

Program designed to be beneficial to the Bureau's operation

both in the field and at FBIHQ. This program was formulated

at a conference attended by Messrs. Walters, Miller, and a

representative of Acting Director Gray's Office.

the new revised extremist Informant Program elimi-

nates urban (ghetto) informants and is limited to potential

extremist informants (PEI) *extremist

informants (EI), and

leonfidential™

sources-extremist (CS-E).

Definitions and qualifications for these new infor-

mant categories are as follows:

A PEI is an individual who is in a position to fur-

nish information concerning extremist activities of individuals

and organizations. A PEI should also be utilized to furnish in-

formation of an extremist nature in those geographi salte

where there is a potential for violence.

nate and he person authority the sachs nee to dese

below. These informants are to be operated for a period of not

more than one year and not less than six months providing their

potential is such that it appears they will qualify for elevation

to EI.

A PEI must be discontinued immediately following a

determination that he has no future potential as an EI and those

PEIs not elevated at the end of one year must be discontinued.

Re:

Extremist Informant Program

The following are exceptions to the SAC's authority

for granting the approval of the operation of a PEI. If any

of the following conditions exist, the SAC must obtain author-

ity from FBIHQ prior to operating any individual as a PEI:

1. Any individual in a sensitive position (i.e. news

media, educational field or any other field where disclosure

as an informant could cause concern to the Bureau).

Any individual contemplating membership in, being

considered for membership in, or presently in an extremist

organization.

3. Any individual who has been charged with a

felony violation in the past five years.

4. Any individual who is presently under indictment

or is on probation or parole, Federal or local.

5. Any individual with an unsavory background yet

who is in a position to furnish uniquely valuable information

not available from other sources.

The Special Agent in Charge has authority to

authorize payments to PEls in the amount of up to $400.

Additional payment authority must be obtained from FBIHQ.

Bureau authority is necessary to elevate a PEI to

an EI. The field recommendation must contain full justifica-

tion. If a PEI does not qualify for EI within one year, he must

be discontinued.

Extremist Informant:

An EI is an individual who has been operated as a

PEI for at least six months (in order that his reliability can

be properly evaluated) and is furnishing extremist information

on a regular basis whether it be concerning an extremist

Re: Extremist Informant Program

organization or an unaffiliated extremist.

In order to elevate

a PEI to an EI, he must have produced authentic data on

extremist activities and be in a position to continue furnishing

extremist intelligence information.

Confidential Source-Extremist:

A CS-E is an individual who is willing to cooperate

with the Bureau by furnishing extremist information brought

to his attention by virtue of his position in the community,

by his employment, or in view of his background in extremist

activities. This

individual, whose identity must be protected,

will not be actively seeking information on behalf of the

Bureau.

Prior to operating anyone as a CS-E, advise FBIHQ of

the individual's identity and the type of information he is

to furnish on a UACB basis.

OBSERVATIONS:

Our present urban informants will be evaluated to

determine if they should be considered in the future as EIs,

PEIs, CS-Es, directed to the Security or Criminal Informant

Programs, or discontinued altogether.

No individual will be operated as an EI or PEI solely

because he is in a "listening post" position.

Io assure we have

informant coverage in those areas where there is a potential for

Violence, instructions have been issued to each SAC to insure

all Special Agent personnel are aware of the need for developing

Information where there is a potential for violence. SACs will be

instructed that those Special Agents not directly involved with

extremist matters, refer those individuals who may possess informa-

tion of potential violence to the Extremist Supervisor in order

that their informant potential may bé assessed.

The field will be instructed that CS-Es are not

to be kept in a pending status unless these sources are

furnishing information on a regular basis. Sources reporting

infrequently may be operated from a pending file with a

provision for closing after a fixed period.of inactivity,

out, of a dead file or out of a control file. Each SAC should

determine which method of operation is best suited for his

individual needs. SACs may desire to establish an informant

map which will clearly depict coverage in any geographical area

within their division.

Evaluation of our present urban informants is to be

handled promptly and completed within sixty days.

Those informants currently carried as probationary

extremist informants should either be designated as PEIs

or elevated to EIs.

If the above revisions to the Extremist Informant

Program are approved, appropriate Manual changes will be made.

That attached memorandum to all SACs be approved

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE

(A) EXTREMIST INFORMANT PROGRAM -- Effective immediately

changes in the Extremist Informant Program as set out below are to

be implemented.

The revised Extremist Informant Program eliminates

the urban (ghetto) informant category and will now be limited to the

following three categories:

(a) potential extremist informant (PEI)

(b) extremist informant (EI)

(c) confidential source-extremist (CS-E)

Potential Extremist Informant:

A PEI is an individual who is in a position to furnish in-

formation concerning extremist activities of individuals and organizations.

A PEI should also be utilized to furnish information of an extremist

- nature in those geographical areas where there is a potential for violence.

The personal authority of the SAC is necessary to designate

and operate an individual as a PEI with exceptions as noted below. These

informants are to be operated for a period of not more than one year and

not less than six months providing their potential is such that it appears

they will qualify for elevation to EI. The PEI must be discontinued im-

mediately following a determination that he has no future potential as

an EI.

The following are exceptions to the SAC's authority for

granting the approval of the operation of a PEl. li any of the following

conditions exist, the SAC must obtain authority from FBIHQ prior to

operating any individual as a PEI:

1. Any individual in a sensitive position (i.e. news media,

educational field or any other field where disclosure as an informant

could cause concern to the Bureau).

5. Any individual with an unsavory background yet who is

in a position to furnish uniquely valuable information not available from

other sources.

The SAC has authority to authorize payments to PEIs in

the amount of up to $400. Additional payment authority must be obtained

from FBI Headquarters.

Bureau authority is necessary to elevate a PEI to an EI.

The field recommendation must contain full justification. I PEI does

not qualify as an El within one year, he is to be discontinued.

Extremist Informant:

An El is an individual who has been operated as a PEI for

at least six months (in order that his reliability can be properly evaluated)

and is furnishing extremist information on a regular basis whether it be

concerning an extremist organization or an unaffiliated extremist. In

order to elevate a PEI to an EI, he must have produced authentic data

on extremist activities and be in a position to continue furnishing

CS-Es are not to be kept in a pending status unless they

are furnishing information on a regular basis. Sources reporting in-

frequently may be operated from a pending file with a provision for

closing aiter a fixed period of inactivity, out of a dead file or out of a

control file. Each SAC should determine which method of operation

is best suited for his individual needs. You may also desire to establish

an informant map which will clearly depict coverage in any geographical

area within your division.

You are instructed to carefully evaluate each of your

urban (ghetto) informants to determine if they should be considered for

redesignation as Els, PEIs, CS-Es, directed to the Security or Criminal

Informant Programs, or discontinued altogether. This should be

handled promptly and be completed within sixty days of receipt of this

communication.

Under the revised program no individual is to be operated

as an El or a PEI solely because he is in a 'listening post"' position.

It is your responsibility to insure that there is informant coverage in

those geographical areas where there is a potential for violence. Alert

all Special Agent personnel to the need for developing information where

there is a potential for violence. Instruct those Special Agents not

directly involved with extremist matters to refer those individuals who

may possess information of potential violence to the Extremist

Supervisor in order that the informant potential of these individuals may

be assessed.

Those informants currently carried as probationary

extremist informants should either be designated as PEIs or elevated

as Els.

NATIONAL CRIME INFORMATION CENTER (NCIC)

The Executives Conference, presided over by Mi. 'folson,

consisting of Messis. DeLoach, Moh, Bishop, Callahan, Casper, Conra.,

Felt, Gale, Rosen, Sullivan, Tavel, Waller's, Beaver and Soyars, met in

•your office foday. Mi. Bishop proposed the establishment of a Stoy Inde:

in the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) computer which would tre

lacivantage of the surveillance capability of the NCIC, to which over 10 mit on

inquiries were direcled in 1969 concerning persons arrested locally, suspicious

persons and vehicles observed in police operations These observations :

persons and things can provide valuable intelligence information to the 1B

and save a considerable amount of investigative time.

The investigative divisions of the Bureau are interested in locating

suspects for interview, such as Selective Service delinquents; etc., but ca

whom no warrant is outstanding; in any police contacts with Soviet Bloc curs

and personel; in any police contacts with, or morement of, agitators; in

police contacis with Cosa Nostra members; and in the movements of criminal

suspects such as bank burglars, sex perverts, etc. The identity of such

individuals or the license numbers of the cars used by them can be entered

into the NCIC computer. Should an inquiry be made by a police agency ari-

where in the country with respect to these records, the NCIC computer

would advise the inquiring police agency "no warrant," "no want outstand.

or "no stolen record." At the same time, the computer would advise a

monitor teiminal located in the NCIC control room that an inquiry was

received, identifying the police agency, the time and the information uses

to make the inquiry. This information would be furnished to the appropriate

investigative division which, in turn, would advise the field to follow up wit

the inguiring agency as to the nature of the inquiry and whether the subjee:

is in custody. Each of the investigative divisions would establish the criterin

for entering a record into the Stop Index and all entries of Stop Indes roeirds

in the NCIC would be done through the NCIC control room for control purgoses:

with no eniries being made directly by the field offices.

RE: Stop Index

National Crime Information Center (NCIC)

In order to program (instruct) the NCIC computer to handle suc:

a Stop Index for the FBI, it would cost approsimatoly §1320 of employee

time. Computcr storage is available and would not be extensive since it is

estimated by the investigative divisions that he Stop Index file would not

exceed 10, 000 entries during the first year.

It was the unanimous opinion of the Conference that the above-

proposed Stop Index in the NCIC. should be established.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

• That the Domestic Intelligence, Special Investigative, General

Investigative, Administrative and Crime Records Divisions work out the

necessary details to place the Stop Index into cifect, with criteria and

procedures for implementing the program to be sent through for approval.

SUBJECT:

STOP INDEX

NATIONAL CRIME INFORMATION CENTER (NCIC)

Programming (preparing instructions for) the computer

for the Stop Index has been completed. This computer application, which!

has been approved by the Director by memorandum dated 2/12/70 (attached),

provides the capability of having the computer notify the NCIC Control Room

when an inquiry is made from any terminal in the NCIC system relative to a

non-fugitive Bureau subject whose descriptors have been placed in this index.

For example, a police officer in Boston arrests an out-of-state

individual on a minor charge, e. g. drunkenness. He routinely requests an

NCIC check relative to the arrested person to determine whether he is wanted

elsewhere. Assume that this individual is a Selective Service subject wanted

only for interview and has been entered in the Stop Index. No warrants are

outstanding for this individual and, therefore, no Wanted Person entry has

been made for him previously in NCIC. The officer would receive a negative

response to his Wanted Person File inquiry ("NO NCIC WANT"). At the same

time as the "NO NCIC WANT" is sent to the Boston Police Department the •

NCIC Control Room would be notified by the NCIC computer of the inquiry

made against the Wanted Person File because a stop was entered in the Stop

Index. The NCIC Control Room would advise the appropriate FBI office

immediately of the Boston Police Department inquiry so that the Bureau's

interests could be secured before the arrested person is released.

62-115784-4

Initially, it is proposed that descriptors of Selectivé Service

subjects who are being sought for interview be placed in this file. Both of

the following criteria must be met.

Re: Sati Ond Crime Information Center (NCIC)

:

1. The subject must be in a non-fugitive status (Identities of

those in fugitive status are placed in the Wanted Person file).

2. The subject's whereabouts is unknown.

Proposed procedures for implementing this program

are as follows:

1. The Special Investigative Division, in coordination with

the Crime Records Division, will instruct the field to submit to the

Bureau (Attention: NCIC) the identities of those Selective Service subjects

meeting the above criteria.

2. NCIC Control Room personnel will enter the descriptors

of these subjects in the Stop Index via an NCIC Control Room terminal.

3. NCIC Control Room personnel will notify the appropriate

field office when a "hit" is made.

The productivity of the Stop Index can be tested on these

numerous Selective Service Subjects who are wanted for questioning only.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the above criteria and procedures for implementing

the Stop Index be approved.

Those in attendance at the conference on January 6, 1972,

included Messrs. Felt, Callahan for Mohr, Bates for Rosen, Soyars, ()

Bishop, Casper, Ponder, Conrad, Shroder for Bates, Waikart, Walters,

Miller, Bassett for Callahan, Mintz for Dalbey, and Staffeld for Cleveland.

The conference considered the suggestion that certain organized -

crime subjects be included in the NCIC Stop Index to assist in being alerted

to inquiries directed to NCIC from police departments and other sources.

The proposal was made by the Special Investigative Division.

Background of Proposal:

Over the years, subjects of interest to our organized crime

investigations have been frequently on the move from one part of the

country to another and on occasion have been subject of arrest or law

enforcement inquiry.

While stops are maintained in the Identification/

Division and elsewhere, when feasible, this gives us only limited capapility

in learning of such law enforcement interest.

the NCIC Stop Index can now accommodate inclusion of organized crime

figures which may assist in learning of any inquiry directed to NCIC with

respect to organized crime subjects whom we may include in the NCIC

Stop Index.

MCT 1 62-715784-5

Mr. Bishop raised the question as to whether or not this might

give rise to the possibility of outside criticism if it were learned that the

NCIC facility was being used;for the Bureau's internal use in this manner

Executives Conference Memorandum

RE: PROPOSED RENAMING THE "NIC STOP INDEX*

AND INCLUSION OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS OF

INTEREST TO CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY

bearing in mind that the NCIC has been publicly identified as a facility which

will give prompt response to any law enforcement inquiry as to whether or

not process is outstanding on an individual on whom an NCIC inquiry might

be made.

Suggested Alternative to Present NCIC Stop Index:

Mr. Walters pointed out that there can be no guarantee of positive

security (immune from dissemination through error or penetration) applicable

to sensitive data if it is stored on line in any computer system with remote

terminals. Also, we emphasize in public statements that no persons are

lodged in the NCIC system unless they meet the announced criteria, pursuant

to guidelines established by the Advisory Policy Board, and the Bureau would

be sorely embarrassed if it were discovered we were not strictly abiding by

our public pronouncements. He pointed out these arguments applied with equal

force to persons already included in the Stop Index as well as to additions now

being proposed for it. As a solution, Walters proposed the entire Stop Index,

which is strictly a Bureau investigative aid, be removed from NCIC and made

a separate program stored off line in the computers. At the end of each day

(or at any established interval), a computer program coula be used to compare

that day's inquiries into NCIC (from the automatic log of such traffic maintained

on tape) against the separate Bureau Stop Index.

Any whits would be routed

to the interested investigative division for follow-up notification to the field.

The only disadvantage from the way the system has been operating is that the

field would not receive immediate notification. Assistant Directors of all

investigative divisions agreed, however, that the time element is not that

critical with respect to persons carried in the Stop Index.

The advantage to the change would be to make the Stop Index com-

pletely separate from NCIC & thus provide 100% assurance against NCIC

mechanical accident which could reveal our internal Bureau Stop Index program

to NCIC user agencies.

Matters Previously Authorized for Inclusion in the NCIC Stop Index:

It was noted that at the present time as a result of previous

approval, certain representatives of the New Left, Weatherman, Medburg

subjects, Venceremos Brigade members, Top Jewel thieves, Selective

Service delinquents and miscellaneous persons on whom the field may place

a special stop are included in the NCIC Stop Index. Mr. Miller pointed out

## Page 508

Executives Conference Memorandum

RE: PROPOSED RENAMING THE "NCIC STOP INDEX""

AND INCLUSION OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS OF

INTERES: TO CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY

that the results of stops pertaining to subjects of interest to the Domestic

Intelligence Division turned up information with respect to the where-

abouts of these subjects which on a timely basis would not have been

available from any other source. The Special Investigative Division

pointed out that it desires the same capability for selected La Cosa Nostra

members, Top Echelon informants, material witnesses who are under

assumed names and other selected organized crime figures.

Relative Costs:

The changeover in the manner suggested would enable the

Stop Index to be operated through our ADP facilities. The Administrative

Division has advised that this would be a much cheaper operation on a

day-to-day basis than present costs of on line computer time which is

being utilized by the NCIC Stop Index.

Conclusion of Executives Conference:

The conference was unanimous in agreeing that the NCIC Stop

Index should be set up as a separate entity and renamed "Stop Index*

and that the names on the Stop Index in addition to those individuals

now included should incorporate those individuals of interest to our

criminal intelligence investigations. The conference also agreed that

the Stop Index should in the future be run periodically during the day

possibly at 12-hote intervals against the inquiries directed by outside

agencies to the Nesturing the previous 12-hour period and the

results provided to ne interested Division for appropriate handling.

independently searched by Voucher Statistical Section through

persons in whom the Bureau is interested. "Hits" are furnished

only to interested field offices for follow-up investigation.

Category I, ADEX, extremist; and Weatherman subjects, as

well as Venceremos Brigade members are currently included in

Stop Index File and valuable intelligence has been secured as a

result concerning their whereabouts and activities. Expansion

of the Stop Index File to include those subjects known to be

involved in or suspected of involvement in urban guerrilla warfare

activities would materially assist in securing data regarding

such individuals' whereabouts and activities on a timely basis.

Stops concerning these subjects would pinpoint their possible

participation in acts of violence in that area and should

materially assist us in our investigative objectives. Subjects,

however, who are wanted by Federal or local authorities are

included in the NCIC Wanted Persons File and because of this

they should not be duplicated in the Stop Index File. This has

been discussed with Computer Systems Division.

The purpose of this memorandum is to récommend

bank robbery and bank burglary suspects be entered in the

Stop Index of the National Crime Information Center (NCIC)

on a selective basis.

OCT

The Bank Robbery and Bank Burglary Suspects Program

was instituted for the purpose of developing information on

potential bank robbers and bank burglars.

The objective of

the program is to maintain such information in a current

status and to have knowledge on a continuing basis as to the

whereabouts and activities of such individuals. This, of

course, enables the field offices to immediately consider these

persons as suspects at the time a bank robbery or bank burglary

occurs. All offices are not required to maintain a Bank

Robbery or Bank Burglary Suspects Program. However, those

offices which have experienced problems regarding unsolved

robberies or burglaries have benefited from utilizing this i

program.

62-115784-1

We currently have a total of 1094 bank robbery and

bank burglary suspect cases in 45 of our 59 field offices. It

is believed that the field could be substantially aided in

their coverage of the suspects' activities if selected suspects

known to be travel prone were included in the Stop Index of

NGIC. Substantial investigative effort could be saved in

attempts to determine the suspects' travel and activities if

inquiry is made of the indices and field offices are sub-

sequently advised of

fEr land location of such inquiries

5277

ACTION: It is recommended this memorandum bentouted through

the Computer Systems Division in order that appropriate observation

xe-may be made by that Division as to the adoptignmaf th4572

have been cooly

received.

Obviously is Communist background is undesiraole

to the Negro civil rights movement. It is true that he has

nad contact with BAYARD RUSTIN, but RUSTIN's leadership ir

civil rights appears toloe dwindling due to his past relations

with the CP movement and the recent publicity given to his

attending a USSR UN Delegation affair.

Additionaly, the NYO views DAVIS' threat to resign

as National Secretary with skepticism. Should he follow through

with this threat and take on a lesser responsibility, such as

in hallei, the question immediately comes to mina as where

would DAVIS be able to publicly speak out, on whose platior,

with whose backing and, additionally, where could he obtain

a news media such as "The Worker" to publish his articles?

obviously, if he does

resign, GUS HALI Will undoubtedly

look upon this act with an air of "good riddance."

Thereafter,

it is inconceivable HALL would permit DAVIS, should he remain

In the Party, to publicly speak out with the Party's plesssing

anà/or support, nor would he permit articles of DaVIs' to

appear in the Party publications.

The NYO feels DAVIS possesses enough intelligence

to realize how foolhardy such an act would be, that he does noù

intend to resign, and his only interst in making such statements

would be to gain more public recognition by HALL as a Party

functionary.

EISUR-

NY 2359-S* has reported on the details of a meeting of

the National Board, Communist Party, USA, held in New York City,-

12/4/63. Among the items discussed

was a report by Benjamin J

the Party's National Secretary, on the assassination of

President John I. Kennedy. U

Davis,

who blamed the assassination on the lawlessness

which was caused by the ultraright,

was confident that the American

Davis commented that Oswald

Harvey Oswald) was with the Central Intelligence Agency. C(U

'Davis feels that the appointment of Chief Justice Earl

Warren to head a commission to investigate the assassination was a

correct choice as he, Chief Justice Harren, is a person who acts

with concern toward the American people against the

"established

hatreds from

the State and local police in Texas and the FBI in

Washington." (p(u)

OBSERVATION:

Davis: comments are indicative of the Party's desires to

blane the assassination of President Kennedy on the ultraright.

The fact that Davis feels the American people, particularly the

Negro people, are not blaming the communists appeals to the Party as

it was most concerned over how the public was going to react.

lack of blame of the communists could well be utilized in the future

to boost the morale of the Party's rank-and-file members. Volu

COMES INFLURNCE IN RACKAL HAYERS CONFIENTIAL

Carl Bloice, correspondent for the "People's World," a west

coast communist newsnaper, who recently spent a great deal of time with

SNCC people in the uth,

Marxist classics ar very familiar to the SNCC Leadership.

conmented according to a source, resulte

Dorothy iller, a CP member in June, 1963, was identified

as a representatii of the SNCC in Georgia In

April, 1963.

In Noven-er, 1963, Gerald Stern advised a Bureau Agent that

he has been coordinating recent SNCC activities and the sNCC headquarters

in Greenwood would always know his whereabouts.

John Rosenberg has

allegedly been seen in close contact with SNCC workers and, according

to B. C. Hammond, Police Commissioner, Greenwood, a local police officer

observed Rosenberg departing a Negro hotel in the

company of a Negro

female, presumed to be an SNCC worker. (It is noted that rosenberg is

of the

white race.)

OBSERVATIONS:

It is evident from our investigations that Department Attorneys

Rosenberg and Stern are in close association with SNCC people in

mississippi, the reasons for which are unknown to us. We do not know if

they are operating under Departmental instructions.

We believe that

because implications inherent to this association could well prove to be

an embarrassing situation, the Department should be advised.

This way

the Bureau can be on record with the Department concerning the communist

background of some of the SNCC people in the event that a future question

arises as to Department Attorneys' not knowing the type of people that

they were counseling.

RECOMMENDATION:

Dra idiotis

The attached letter to the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney

General be hand delivered by Assistant Director Courtney A. Evans in view

of the

sensitive nature of this matter.

At that time, Mr.

advise that this information was received by the Bureau during our inves-

tigations of communist influence in racial matters, civil rights and

election laws and not as a result of

any Bureau investigation of Rosenberg

and stern or of the sNce,

other than an infiltration case of the SNCC.

Mr. Evans can call the attention of the Attorney General to the possible

embarrassing situation which exists

with the association of the Depart

mental attorneys and the SNCC.

This memorandum recommends that Special Agent Henry

Security Supervisor, and Special Agent Robert R. Nichols, both of the

Atlanta Office, be ordered to report to the Bureau on 12/23/63 for a

one-day conference in order to explore fully the communist influence

in racial matters as it pertains to Martin Luther King, Jr., whose head-

quarters are in Atlanta,

Georgia, and to discuss avenues of approach to

exposing King's unholy

alliance with the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA).

Thr racial unrest in the United States is currently the target

to the establishment of a Negro-labor coalition which the communists

This communist goal constitutes a serious national security problem

(SCHC)

Director approved

a conference be held between repre-

sentatives of our Atlanta Office and Seat of Government personnel.

Recognizing the delicacy of this entire situation because

of the prominence of King, the primary purpose of the conference was

to explore how best to carry on our investigation to produce the

desired results without embarrassment to the Bureau.

Included in

our discussivi vas à compiote unaljois es the avenues of approach

aimed at neutralizing King as an effective Negro leader and developing

evidence concerning King's continued dependence on communists for

guidance and direction.

The conference was held at the Seat of Government on

12-23-63.

It was attended by Security Supervisor Henry Rowse and

SA Robert Nichols from our Atlanta Office. The Seat of Government/?

representatives were Assistant Director W. C. Sullivan, Inspector

Joseph A. Sizoo,

Section Chief F. J. Baumgardner and Supervisors

L. I. Gurley and David Ryan. The conference lasted from 9 a.m..to

6 p.m.

Assistant Director Sullivan briefed the conference on the

task at hand. He pointed out the necessity for good judgment and

discreetness in conducting any investigation concerning this matter.

He made it clear it was necessary for us to continue obtaining

evidence of the CPUSA's influence on King and, through king, influence

on the Negro people.

although King is a minister, we have already developed information

COP

concerning weaknesses in his character which are of such a nature

as to make him unfit to serve as a minister of the gospel.

Mr. Sullivan pointed out

that the field should continue to

gather information concerning King's personal activities, such as

order that we may consider using this information at an opportune

time in a counterintelligence move to discredit him.

During the discussion which followed, the men from the

field outlined in detail the operation of the SCLC in Atlanta and

the manner in which it is managed by King.

by King's prominence

Our discreet approach to this case has been necessitated

and. the delicate situation which surrounds the

entire racial movement. A wrong move could well result in extreme

embarrassment to the Bureau.

As a result of the conference, it was

decided we need to develop

additional information in the following

areas:

()

He must determine and chock out ait of the employees

of the SCLC.

(2) We must locate and monitor the funds of the SCIC.

(3) We must identify and check out the sources who

contribute to the SCIC.

(4) We must continue to keep close watch on King's

personal activities.

(5) . We will, at the proper time when it can be done

without embarrassnent to the Bureau, expose King

as an immoral opportunist who is not a sincere

person but is exploiting the racial situation for

personal gain.

(6)

We will explore the possibility of utilizing additional

specialized investigative techniques at the SCLC office.

Our technical coverage on King and the SCLC is producing

excellent information. It was decided that, in view of this fact

and since

we could not engage in active investigation at this time

without embarrassment to the Bureau, we would hold in abeyance...2eb

another 90 days. During this

time, ve WilT utilize the information obtained from our technical

coverage and conduct whatever investigation can be made discreetly.

This 1s a preliminary memorandum of information available

as of early a.m. 8/29/63 concerning communist activities relative

to the March on Washington, 8/28/63. We had a number of informants

from various cities at the March who were unable, for security

reasons, to report to the Bureau while still in Washington, D. C.

(WDC) •

We are expediting debriefing of these informants by our

field offices after which a comprehensive memorandum will further

inform you.

Communist Party, USA (CPUSA), Members in Attendance

As of the morning of the March we had reports indicating

that almost 200 CPUSA members planned to attend. While most were

to be from New York City (NYC) and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,

other areas such as Upstate New York, Maryland, New Jersey,

Western Pennsylvania,

Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, Minnesota,

Colorado, Oregon, Washington and California were to be represented.

Bureau offices reported observing in excess of 150 Party members

boarding various nodes of transportation early on 8/28/63 bound

for WDC. Number observed does not necessarily include all Party

attending since complete information yet to be obtained.

Washington Field Office Agents identified Gus hall, Cruse General

Secretary, and several other national Party functionaries at March.

Although Gus Hall interrupted a Maine vacation

NEGRO QUESTION

COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN RACIAL MATTERS

INTERNAL SECURITY - C

Re Bureau letter dated 10/14/63 which set forth

the fact that JAMES LUSTIG made statements at a

meeting of the CP, USA, National Executive Committee

on 10/3/63 regarding the influence of the NiCe in

the racial situation in New Jersey.

In effect, LUSTIG claimed that (1) a "progressive

person" had actually handled everything in connection with

the March"on Washington (MOW), while a person named RICHARDSON

was only the titular head; (2) that Party people greatly

influencedthe participation in the mum on dizo/oo lu mem deisey?

and (3) claimed that demonstrations at City Hall and on

construction jobs would probably not have taken place if it

were not for party initiative.

Newark has reviewed its files and contacted know-

ledgeable informants and sources in order to assess the truth

or falsity of LUSTIG's claims.

IDENTITY OF "PROGRESSIVE PERSON"

The "progressive person" referred to by LUSTIG is

apparently SOPHIE FITZGERALD, a CP member at Paterson, N.J.

SOPHIE FITZGERALD was CO-Chairman of the North Jersey.

Coordinating Committee for the MOW.

The other Co-Chairman

was Assemblyman GEORGE C. RICHARDSON Of Rewark, New Jersey

Reverend JOSEPH RANDALL, Negro Minister active in

significant role in Essex County in preparation for

though RICHARDSON delegated considerable authority in prepara-

tIon for the MOW to his political campaign manager, who is

definitely not a "progressive person".

Ns 25/60 Seated

instruction meeting for leaders of the MOW held prior to

the March and was not a figurehead.

INFLUENCE OF CP PEOPLE ON PARTICIPATION

IN MOW FROM NORTHERN NEW JERSEY

Newark files and all sources contacted reflect

that the greater portion of the participants from Northern

New Jersey in the MOW were under the sponsorshiy of the

National Association for the Advancement of Colored People

(NAACP). The NAACP proceeded independently and was not in

any way connected with the North Jersey Coordinating

committee for the MOW

TwformAnt

NK 2116-S noted on 10/24/63 that most of the

participants from Northern New Jersey in the MOW came from

Essex Coanty. He stated that the NJCP exercised a minimum

of influence on participants in the MOW from Essex County;

in fact, prior to the MOW, the NJCP leaders in Essex County

were actually trying to find out what was going on in regard

INformati to the MOW, rather than influencing or guiding participants.

_NK 2116-S felt that aside from participating as individuals

in the MOW, NJCP leaders and members had no influence on

participants from Essex County.

PARTY INITIATIVE IN DEMONSTRATIONS AT

CITY HALL AND AT CONSTRUCTION SITES

Newark sources and files reflect no construction

site demonstrations which resulted from party initiative.

Two CP members are reported to have participated

in a picket l'ne at the site of construction of Barringer

High School 1 Newark.

One of the CP members, whose identity

was apparent y known to leaders of the picket line, was asked

to leave th picket line by an official of the Congress on

Racial Equa ity (CORE).

1 wark liles and canvass of informants and sources

reflect thai one demonstration at the Newark City Hall resulted

from Party initiative. This demonstration was sponsored by

Tuforman proposals by cp members..

the Unemployed Council of Newark (not defunct) as a result of

JAMES LUSTIG arranged for printing

or leaflets calling for the demonstration and LUSTIG made

arrangements for NK 2116-s to act as the leader of the

demonstration, which occurred on 5/11/63.

The result was

that on 5/11/63 Newark City Ball

was picketed for approximately

one hour by a total of approximately 35 persons.

Approximately

ten of these persone were CP members. headed by JAMES LUSTIG.

Most or the remainder were a group from the Labor Negro.

Vanguard Conference (LNVC) which is headed by CLARENCE COGGINS

and is opposed by the CP.

Following the picketing, the

pickets conferred with a representative of the Mayor of Newark.

(A summary of CP participationin this demonstration appears on

page 7 of Newark letterhead memorandum submitted by airtel

to the Bureau, both dated 7/24/63, and headed, "CP, USA,

'NEGRO QUESTION, COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN RACIAL MATTERS; IS - C".)

On 6/10/63, about 100 persons picketed Newark City

• Hall in a two-hour racial demonstration.

The Unemployed Council

of Newark endorsed this picketing, which was sponsored by

other organizations.

LUSTIG had favored and encouraged that

the UCN participate in this picketing, but it appears likely

the UCN would have participated in any case.

At Paterson, New Jersey, DANIEL and SOPHIE FITZGERALD,

both CP members, participated in a picket line at the Paterson

City. Hall on 7/29/63, which was sponsored by CORE and the NAACP.

The Mayor called in these pickets, including the FITZGERALDS

and conferred with them. (This information appears in Newark

airtel and letterhead memorandum dated 7/30/63, captioned

"DEMONSTRATION AT PATERSON CITY HALL BY CORE AND NAACP; RACIAL

MATTIRS", copy of which was designated for Bureau file 100-3-116.)

CP members have participated in other demonstrations

and activities in New Jersey concerning the racial situation.

The CP did not initiate these activities, but generally learned

of these activities and then participated in them with the

obvious desire to encourage demonstrations insofar as possible.

CONCLUSIONS

It as the conclusion of the Newark Office that

LUSTIG's sta ements to the Party's NEC meeting on 10/3/63

gave an exa, gerated impression of the intluence of the Nich

in connecti n with the MOW and racial demonstrations in

New Jersey. LUSTIG's probable aim is to enhance his own

position.

SOPHIE FITZGIRALD, as Co-Chairman of the North

Jersey Coordinating Committee for the MOW, did play a part

in arranging rides to Washington from the

New Jersey,

ared, but over all, the CP influence on participation in the

MOW from northern New Jersey was minimal.

NJCP influence on construction site demonstrations

was practically nil.

The NJCP did initiate a picketing demonstration

at Newark City Hall which lasted one hour on 5/11/63.

CP

members participated in other demonstrations, but the ci

did not originate them and CP influence on these other

demonstrations was very limited.

HERBERT

KRANSDORF, Organizer.

Chup, the only

CP, official currently active in this area,

heads a loosely

organized group of six Negroes with whom he meets regularly.

This group has been given no name and is the only known CP

group operating within the CPWP. Included in the estimated

CrWP membership of 17,

are 8 Negroes, none of whom maintain

a national level position or a district level position above

the status of club chairman.

During the past few months, KRANSDORE has taken

great interest in the problems of the Negro and civil

rights issues and he and members of his family have

participated in picketing demonstrations at Pittsburgh.

He supported and took part in the March on Washington and

has attempted to exert some influence on Negro groups to

break up segregation practices in Pittsburgh.

He has been

critical of the Pittsburgh chapter of the National

Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)

calling it a social group rather than a political action

group.

Although KRANSDORF has engaged in a great deal

of talking and "preaching" regarding racial matters in

general, the plight of the Negro, and the lack of

demonstrations in the Pittsburgh

area, to CP members and

his other associates, he (and the CPWP) have had very

little influence on racial matters in the Pittsburgh

He and his followers are not known to have

infiltrated or gained control of

any group involved in

civil rights demonstrations or any other groups working

to advance the cause of Negroes in this area.

Concerning Pittsburgh's coverage of communist

activities in the Negro field, it is noted that of the

six live informants who furnish information concerning

che CrWe, five are Negroes. In addition, two

(one a Negro) and another source (PG 180-S C6151

daily contact with KRANSDORF) provide coverage in this

regard. All of these live informants are cognizant of

situation and especially regarding any CP involvement

In any Negro movements or racial

have, during the past

I'ew months, provided pertinent and timely information

• concerning

KRANSDORF's statements and ideas regarding

racial matters and are in a position to be aware of

any action he might take to directly involve CPWP members

'in such matters in the future. In addition, Pittsburgh

has five other sources in groups sponsoring

the Western Pennsylvania area who can also furnish

• information concerning CP involvement in these matters.

It is believed that Pittsburgh's coverage of

communist

activities in the Negro field in Western

'ennsylvania at the present time is very good; nowever.

Pittsburgh will continue to emphasize the importance of

this matter during contacts with the above informants and

will

closely follow HERBERT KRANSDORE's activities so

that appropriate investigative steps may be initiated in

the event he and the CPWP become directly involved in

racial matters in this area.

COMMUNIS : INFLUENCE

IN RACIAL MATTERS

INTERNAI SECURITY - C

I thought you would be interested in a resume of pertinent

data concerning captioned matter, with particular reference to the

communist influence on the 8/28/63 March on Washington.

First, as to

communist "participation," you will recall that at the

• 10/1-6/63 meet-

ing of the National Executive Conmittee of the Party, Gus Hall stated

that an estimated 5,000 communists participated in the March in one

way or another. As to the number of Party members (here we are differ-

entiating between conmunists and Party members), the following analysis

has

been mare from reports received from the field. For the purpose of

making this estimate, we considered as current communist Pariy

(Cry

members any individuals who have been reported to be members of the

Party since 1/1/62. The estimate, based upon our field reports, is

as follows.

A total of 125 CP members from the territories covered by

all field offices other than New York was reported as observed in

Washington, D. C., 8/28/63. The New York Office reported a total of e

37.

The total for all offices, therefore, is 162.

We also had reported to us that an additional 67 Party men-

bers were observed boarding transportation media in the New York City

area destined for Washington on 8/28/63. While it cannot be positively

stated that these 67 were actually observed in Washington, D. C., it

would be a fairly logical assumption that they did come to Washington,

barring such unusual circumstances as a breakdown of a bus or buses or

any of the chartered trains.

We had no reports of such happenings.

Therefore, if we were to.add these 67 to the other 162, we could, with

justified logic,

estimate that approximately 229 Party members were ir

Washington, D. C., On 8/28/63.

REC-39 / 61-9-116-525

It is significant to note that among the current Party mem-

bers who were in Washington were such national functionaries as Gus

Hall, General Secretary; Joseph Brandt, Administrative Assistant; Phil

Bart, National Organizational Secretary; James E. Jackson, Editor-in-

Chief of "The Worker"; Arnold Johnson, Peace Activity and Public

Memorandum Baumgardner to Sullivan 11-22-63 entitled as above

pointed out that Department Attorneys John Rosenberg and Gerald Stern

spend much time with individuals connected with the Student Non-Violent

Coordinating Comnittee (SNCC) in Mississippi. Our continuing investi-

gation of all communist activities, as well as our investigations in

civil rights and election law matters, has revealed that certain

individuals having subversive backgrounds have been affiliated with

SNCC activities. We instructed Memphis Division to furnish additional

information concerning the identities of any subversive individual who

may have been contant with Rosenbons and steri chrougi orco driiviiles.

Instant memora.dum sets out a summarization of pertinent information

available to the Memphis Division pertaining to this matter.

By way of background, the sNCe is headquartered in Atlanta,

Georgia.

It is an organization working for desegregation and complete

equal rights for Negroes.

We have looked into SNCC on a national basis

and have found insufficient information on a national level to warrant

active investigation.

developments.

We are currently looking into communist infiltration of

SNce In the san Francisco, California, area. Pertinent information

concerning the connection

between individuals with subversive backgrounds

and the SNCC in the South has been previously furnished the Department.

Memphis advised that the individuals with subversive back-

grounds who have been connected with SNCC and who are involved in this

matter are Fxed Hirsch, Carl Bloice and Dorothy Miller.

Fred Isha Hirsch, identified as a Communist Party (CP) member

until early 1963, was one of five individuals recently arrested in

Greenwood, Mississippi. According to Curtis Lary, Chief of Police,

Greenwood, these five individuals were connected with or working on

behalf of

the Greenwood headquarters of SNCC.

is approximately 600 feet of 16 mm. negative film with

GUS HALL and CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT held on February 21, 1964,

at

the Midland Hotel, Chicago.

This press conference called by

HALL was his answer to an attack on CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT and the

Illinois CP which appeared in the February 20, 1964, issue

"Chicago's American."

The news article was a result ot

our counterintelligence program, two copies of which are also

enclosed herewith.

This particular news article was excellent for our

purposes since it touched on several very sensitive points

with the CP, including LIGHTFOOT's shortcomings as a CP leadei;

the inability of the Party to effectively infiltrate the well*e

and civil rights movements in this city much less

lead these

movements as a "vanguard" party is supposed to do; LIGHTFOOT's

rebuff and altercation with an arch enemy of the Party, THE ULSA

leader of a group of communists dedicated to the

revolutionary line of MAO Tse-tung, who has been able to

involve her group in these struggles; the accusation against

the CP by EHRLICH that the Party here is non-existent and

that LIGHTFOOT. and his crowd are "phonies"; and the accusation

that LIGHTFOOT has deserted the working class he purports to

represent.

In the film HALl dwells on the point that the CP

is involved in the Negro movements and will henceforth

increase their activity in this field. As far as we know this

is the first time that a CP official has made such statements,

publicly. HALL's statement served to alert

tens of thousands

of Negroes and their leaders of the Cp's objective to work in

their movements which can only mean the exploitation of their

difficulties.

It has been our experience in Chicago that to a

Negro, no one is more despicable than one who attempts to

exploit him for personal or political gain. Negroes are very

deeply suspicious of a member of the white

race, as in the

case of HALL, who makes claims of devotion and dedication to

the cause of Negro freedom.

HAII, and the CP have already been rebuffed by leaders

of CORE and the NAACP as evidenced by the proceedings of a

press conference held by JAMES JACKSON at the Hamilton Hotel,

Chicago, on February 26, 1964.

MARTY O'CONNER, a reporter for "Chicago's American"

reported that at the conclusion of the press conference of

JAMES JACKSON, an official of the Chicago Chapter, NAACP, who

was present,

loudly demanded a press conterence to answer

JACKSON who, like HALL, had stated the CP would become involved

in the Negro freedom movements.

This NAACP official disavowed

any connection between

the NAACP and the CP.

He said the NAACP

did not want the support of the Party in its fight for Negro

equality, and forther, that a number of years ago the NAACP bad

expelled

the communists from the organization.

He pledged that

his organization would continue to fight for Negro rights

without the assistance of the CP.

It is also reported in the February 27, 1964, issue

of the "Chicago Sun-Times" that JACKSON had stated that the CP

would support a "work-stoppage" proposed by Negro groups. The

newspaper noted that it had questioned Chicago area civil rights

groups who stated they had not heard of a work stoppage proposal

and would not support such a move..

The article further noted the communists said they

had invited representatives of all civil rights groups to the

press conference but only one appeared and he used the

opportunity to denounce the communists. He was described

aS SIDNEY FINLEY, a regional field secretary for the NAACP,

who accused the communists of "trying to force their way

into the civil rights movement."

It is obvious that this counterintelligence move

forced the CP to make a public announcement of their objectives

regarding the civil rights movement, and they have already

been rebuffed by the leaders of the movement.

A portion of the enclosed film was shown on a

Chicago telecast on the evening of February 21, 1964, and on

it is obvious that it

it may be beneficial to the Bureau, particularly for In-

Service training purposes.

The film may be useful for the

following purposes:

1. It depicts an excellent example of the impact

of a counterintelligence operation on the leadership of the

CP.

2. It shows the skill employed by GUS HAll in this

news conference, his ability to "thrust and parry" with the

press

and his ability to evade and skirt direct questions.

3. It depicts LIGHTFOOT's attempt to twist the press

attack on him into an attack on the Negro race.

that LIGHTFOOT convinced many people on this point, but it

shows his skill at propaganda.)

1. In considering points 2 and 3 above, the Bureau

may wish to consider future counterintelligence moves which

may give the CP opportunity to stage a counterattack by

employing their skills in the art of propaganda and turn a

counterintelligence move to their own advantage.

While this

was not the case in this instance, it could possibly happen

in future counterintelligence moves.

In the analysis of this investigation it should

further be borne in mind MARTIN LUTHERKING, JR., is so closely

related to the organization Southern Christian

this very fact, his realizatin

of this condition and that he was going to endeavor to eleyate

the character and picture of Southern Christian Leadershin

A. Utilization of an Anonymous Source

Based on information made available and evaluation

of same, consideration has been given to the utilization of

an anonymous source; however, it is noted that on one occasion

it was reported that STANLEY D. LEVISON had apparently proyided

$500 in funas to be utilized for

"night watchman purposes.

It is further noted there are approximately 40 employees at

this time in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

Office, whose hours of employment are most irregular and

Leadership Conference for such an anonymous source development

could not be conducted with sufficient discreetness to insure

the success of this type operation. It is further noted that

the building which houses the offices of Southern Christian

Leadership Conference is also occupied by a Negro Radio

Station Which has most irregular nours for its

employees.

Another portion of the building is occupied and utilized for

Lodge purposes and there is considerable traffic in and out

of the building at unusual or irregular hours.

This office

space is located in an exclusively Negro neighborhood for

approximately one mile in radius except for the downtown

business

district.

From the above the security problems are obvious;

however,

there is room to explore this further and our investi

gation will be designed to determine any weakness which we can

exploit to our advantage.

U.:?

B. Further Use of News Media

The illi

Sources have recently reported certain displeasures

on the part of kING relating to statements attributed to ROY

TWILKINS, Head_of the NAACP, which displeasures were resultant

of statements made by WILKINS in regard to the Civil Rights

Bill presently in Congress.

KING indicated he was tired of

WILKINS making these statements which in effect carried KING's

concurrence when in fact KING had not been consulted.

- 2=.

HH 55179 Do0Id:32989648 Page 573

## Page 574

AT 100-6520-D

AFM: elt

It is recommended that both the New York and Atlanta

Office remain particularly alert for any further indications o

a rift possibly developing between WILKINS and KING so that

Iull utilization may be made of this incident.

If information is developed confirming such a disagree..

ment a possible course of action may include the use of RALPH

MCGILI, Publisher of the "Atlanta Constitution" in order to

explore the basis of such disagreement and also to feed pertinent

subversive connections and dealings of KING to WIRKINS.

It is

unknown to Atlanta whether McGILL is personally acquainted with

WILKINS but it is known that McGILL has been most cooperative

Att at beth en

with the Atlanta Office of the FBI and the Bureau and if he

Is acquainted with WILKINS, this could be considered.

It is further suggested the Bureen, through its

respective auxiliary offices,

may desire to discreetly

furnish information to reliable news individuals who could

report by story and photograph items which would show KING's

high living and exorbitant spending. In this regard, it

• Is noted that since February, KING has been in San Juan, Puerto

Rico, Hawaii, Los Angeles, residing in the Hyatt House

at

$75 per day and again in Nassau, BWI, under an assumed name.

While it is realized that certain newspaper publicity might

be

favorable

to KING it is believed that certain articles reporting

this

high living would have a distinct advantage of causing

many

Negro supporters of the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference to lose faith in this organization, Its leader

and their endeavors and hence discontinue their support through

the contribution of funds.

It is realized that the bulk of

the financial support comes from the white community but Negroes

provide the numerical majority and support for demonstrations

in the street.

Information has come to the attention of the

Atlanta Office recently that BILL/SHIPP, State News Editor

for the "Atlanta Constitution" has been making inquiry in

the Albany, Georgia, area regarding the reconstruction of

the three Negro churches burned in that area during the

Conference as it relates to the employment of HUNTER PITTS

articles authored by SHIPP have related to the delay in the

reconstruction of these destroyed churches and he has also

been critical of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

'for its failure to make public records as to its financial affairs.

It is noted that funds, for the reconstraction of three

Negro churches in the Albany area, were obtained through public

solicitations initiated by the

"Atlanta Constitution" and other

organizations in Atlanta.

The SCIo also solicited funds for this

project and in so doing

used the volunteer services of JACke

TROBINSON to collect approximately $65,000 throughout the U.S.

SCLe in turn was in cnarge vi die fudo culicotea for this pro

ject and responsible for the disbursing of these funds to the

contractors building the churches. It is further pointed out

that the delay in the reconstruction of these churches has been

primarily a result of the contractor not receiving lunds from

Southern Christian Leadership Conference on a periodic basis

Ior the completion of these churches. It is suggested that the

'Bureau may desire to furnish to SHIPP on an anonymous basis,

certain specific leads where he may develop the necessary data

so that he may further write critical news stories which would be

based on information obtained by him rather than by this agency.

An example of this type of information would include furnishing

the name and address of a Catholic priest from South Alabama,

whose name is unknown to the Atlanta Office but possibly known

to the Mobile Office, who after several years affiliation with

the Southern Christian Leadership Conference publically

denounced this organization based on his experiences

and know-

•' ledge of their financial dealings.

This priest attributed to an

• SCIC Official a statement that they needed to have a demonstration

in order to raise money.

This was just prior to a large scale

demonstration held in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1903.

Background Investigation of Southern Christian

Leadership Conference Employees

The Atlanta Office currently is maintaining separate

files on all SCLC employees and is in the process of aiscreesi

investigating the background of twelve key employees and

associates in an effort to obtain some weakness that could

be used for counter-intelligence activities.

pertinent data has been developed on these

Indivlauals which

is recognized as an opportunity for counter-intelligence purposes

with the exception of KING's girl friends' activities.

Recommendations will be forthcoming if and when weaknesses are

developed.

D. Disgruntled Employees

It is to be noted tHat Atlanta sources have disclosed

recently that RUTH BAIled she contacted an employee of the

presents itself to exploit BAILEY's discontent. At this tire,

however, it is felt that because BAILEY was rehired that the

time for appraising her should be delayed.

Sources further reported a certain trend of dis-

content and dissatisfaction on the part of employees in

the Atlanta Office of SCIO based over preferential pay to

individuals performing the same duties. This discontent

has been temporarily alleviated by recent pay increases made

to all employees.

It is suggested that this area may present

opportunities in the future from a counter-intelligence

standpoint by the injection of false information with

certain discontented employees such as EDWINA SMITH, the

fiance of HUNTER PITTS O'DELL.

E. Financial Dealings of KING and the Southern Christian

Leadersnip Conference

Analysis of recently received tax returns through

1962 and Internal Revenue Service investigation of KING anc

the Southern Christian Leadership Conference for the years

1957, 1958 and 1959, reflects that the main question of

contention was the status of money received by Southern Christian

Leadershin Conference.

KING's contention was that these receipts

were gifts, while Internal Revenue contends that income fron

business operations, namely SCIC, was in reality

income.

Atlanta sources have recently reported

• Atlanta Retail Credit Company was furnished details to the

ellect that scLe had received $750,000 during 1903.

Sources have also advised that one

'Internal Revenue Service employee, was making a current income

investigation regarding the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference or one of their employees.

Sources at Internal

Revenue Service report that WILLIE RICHARDSON is the only

Negro Internal Revenue Agent of the Atlanta Regional Office

and has been so employed for approximately one year.

It is pointed out that KING has authored several

books and it is believed that funds received from this author-

ship are the funds most difficult to report as gifts as KING's

'contention has been' in the past, rather than as income.

From the return it is apparent that SCLC is

classified as a tax-exempt organization; however, contributions

to 1t are not allowable by the donor as a tax deductible

contribution to a charity organiation. SCLC is considered

- 6 -

_WH 55179 DocId:32989648

## Page 578

AT 100-6520-D

AFM: elt

a tax-exempt civil organization. It is noted that in order

to obtain this tax-exempt status, a petition must be filed

by the organization with Internal

Revenue Service, a copy

of the organization's charter, By Laws, financial

statements

and a list of sizeable contributors to this organization is

also filed.

It is suggested that the Bureau may desire to

obtain through liaison further data available regarding

On MARTIN LUTHER KING, TR., OF SCLC.

It is felt the list of contributors of sizeable

gifts to SCLo may be important as with future information it

may be possible to compare whether KING is recording all

of his contributions as gifts or whether in fact,

there

is a discrepancy in ine amuuni undieù iu cio anù the

amount KING reports as gifts.

If such a discrepancy does

exist it is likely KING is utilizing these funds for his

own personal affairs.

It is believed that through various past incidents

as reported by Atlanta sources a trend can be established

, to show collusion on the part of donors who are making

.: contribution to SCLE by various and devious means. Points

in contention in this regard relate to a sizeable contribution

of funds collected at a benefit held in California by SAMMY

It was proposed that these funds

be made payable to a church in California. These funds were

then forwarded by the church in California to Ebenezer Baptist

Church, Atlanta, and thence to SCIC, or MARTIN LUTHER KING,

Another point in contention relates to the recent

Atlanta sources

reported that this dealer was interested in establishing

a capital loss in his vusiness operations and was utilizing

the gift of the vehicles in so doing. In order to establish

-7-

this capital loss and as well claim a contribution, the

vehicles were actually

given

to the West Hunter Baptist

Church,

the Ebenezer Baptist Church and to the United Church

of Christ, Decatur, Georgia, all of which vehicles were to

be made available to the SCIo.

It is further panted out that Atlanta sources

advised that SCIC is currently short on

funds and is

known to owe Darby Printing Company, Atianta, approximately

1$12,000.

It is believed that donors and creditors of SCLo

present two important areas for counter-intelligence activities.

In regard to the donors it is suggested

that official SCIC

stationery bearing KING's signature, copies of which are availade

to the Atlanta Office and will be furnished by separate communi-

cation to the Bureau Laboratory for reproduction purposes,

be utilized in advising the donors that Internal revenue

Service is currently checking tax records of SCLO and that

KING through this phoney correspondence wants to advise the

donor insuring that he reported his gifts in accordance with

Internal Revenue requirements so that he will not become

involved in a tax investigation. It is believed such a letter

of this type fron SCLO may

• cause considerable concern and

'eliminate future contributions. From available information

it is apparent that many of these contributors to SCIC are

doing so in order to claim tax deductions and in order to be

eligible for such deductions, the contribution is being made to

the abenezer Baptist Church, which in turn is forwarded

KING or the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

It is also proposed that pretext calls be placed

to Darby Printing Company, impressing upon them the financial

plight of SCLo so that they may be incited into collection

-efforts of the printing bill owed to them in the amount of

• $12,000.

It is further suggested that investigative efforts

be made in auxiliary offices

to determine method used by

KING in settling his accounts and if credit cards are usea,

appropriate checks of these credit card accounts may develop

pertinent inforination regarding KING's financial dealings.

Atlanta confidential sources also advised that

KING has a personal account in New York City and Atlanta, Geor -=

at theCitizens Trust Company. The New York bank is uniencin.

There is also an SCIC banking account in New York City and

the Bureau in other investigative matters; however, it is

known that he is personally acquainted and considered iriendly

with MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., and other members of his

immediate family. It is therefore felt that the necessary

monitoring of his bank account could not be effective vit

the desired security warranted in this investization. It:s

noted that this bank is owned and operated entirely by mer

Э?S

of the Negro race.

F. Subversive Information Reg raing Southern

christian Leadership Conference Employees

It is noted that Reverend CORDY ILLAVIVIAN, Director

of Affiliates of SCLC, was identified by a Springfield

Informant in 1947 as a member of the Communist Party in

Peoria, Illinois. Investigation regarding VIVIAN has reen

instituted to determine his activities since 1947 and whet.er

he has any other sabversive affiliations:

SMITH, Secretary to the Program Director,

to HUNTER PITTS O'DELL, a former SCLC employee, and is noi

to be in frequent contact with him.

She has been responsi-le

for the purchase of numerous copies of the publication

"Freedomways"

some of which were forwarded to SCIC Offices

In Atlanta and others to an SCIC School at Dorchester, Georgia.

To date there are no known other subversive

affiliations on the part of employees of SCIC in the Atlanta

Office.

It is suggested that as a counter-intelligence rove

in this area, that the Bureau or New Yorks may, through its

sources or in other ways, establish publically the utilizator

of

"Freedomways'

and its connection with the Communist Parü.,

by SCIO.

G. Hide-Away

It is noted that the apartment frequently utilizes

by KING for his clandestine romances (FRED BENNETT's apartment)

and ostensibly for writing and resting purposes, has been

located at 3006 Delmar Lane Nai Atlanta teergia.

It is

noted that this apartment is on the ground floor level

having a separate front. and rear entrance. The apartment

building is

of two story construction with partial basement

throughout. The apartment building is one of approximately

seven buildings in a project all of which are occupied by

members of the Negro race.

This apartment project is surrourded

on either side by other multi-awelling unit Negro apartments.

Directly behind the apartment occupied as a hide-away, a

main line of the Aclantic Coast Line Railroad is located.

On

the other side of the railroad, approximately 150-200 yards

away in a house occupied by JOHN C. ALLEN, the only white

resident, from which the back entrance of

the hide-away can

be observed. ALLEN is a Plumbing Inspector for the City of

Atlanta Construction Department. The Atlanta Police Depari-ent,

Atlanta Credit Bureau and

• Atlanta indices have no record of

ALLEN or his wife, MARIE.

Possibly with a Zoomar lens durirs

daylight hours and with field glasses, the rear entrance onij

of the hide-away could be covered from the ALLEN residence.

However, the value of. anything obtained from this type of

coverage is not believed would add to information already

known to the Atlanta Office.

Therefore, no recommendations

along these lines are being

made from a

physical coverage

standpoint. It is noted that the front entrance is directly

across a parking lot from an apartment occupied by JAMES

Balts and his wife and small child. BEVEL is an employee sa

SCIC.

Consideration has been given to requesting Bureau

authority for a technical survey in this area; however,

Atlanta sources have on numerous occasions indicated

an interest on the part of KING and BENNETT of obtaining

another apartment in another area.

In the event this does

not materialize, Bureau authority for technical survey of

this facility will be requested. In regara to the utilization

of a misur, it is noted that the same basic security probler

the office space occupied by SCLe.

Quarters were enlarged

and additional employees hired.

It is unknown but believed

that additional talophone facilities may have been abtainea

and are possibly being installed at this time. Atlanta.will

in the near future,

through sources, determine what facilities

now service the office and make appropriate recommendations

therefrom.

The Atlanta Office will, by separate communication,

request Bureau authority for making a survey realting to

possible installation of trash cover in the office facilities

Of SCIC.

The above analysis is being set forth with..

certain recommendations bearing in mind the main objective of this

investigation is to determine extent of communist influence

in racial matters and

as to how the effectiveness of KING

can be neutralized or discredited, either through commun ist

connections, his moral degradation or his financial

operations.

It is felt that this coverage 'is adequate and, as in.

the case of the NNC meeting, coverage will continue to be afforded

to these type meetings which will bear upon the Party's policies

with respect to the racial situation in the United States.

As regards the extent of the Part's Influence 1n

racial matters, generally, in the United States, it is noted

there was a meeting of the National

Executive Committee (NEC) of the CPUSA, the first two days of

which were devoted to a report on civil rights. BENJAMINDAVIS

delivered the report on the civil rights movement,

during which

he stated that the Party should bear in mind the possibilities of

extending Its influence in the Negro movement, adding that the

Image of the Party as a militant organization among the Negro

people has been dimmed.

=!..

DAVIS sald the Party has credits in the Negro struggle,

Including its participation in numbers in the March on Washington,

"we"

have not brought the Party forward up to now and have

•failed to solve the problem of how to indicate to the Negro the

line of march. He added that' "we" have shown some responsibillty

in relation to the Negro freedom movement but still do not have a

clear line on the role Communists have to play.

He called for the

Party to find a center in the South around which to rally

progressive forces and said they must get Into the struggle in the

South and help solve some of the problems, even though there are

obstacles in the way, because otherwise the Party would be set

back for years.

At the NC meeting in Chicago in February, 1964, BENJAMIN

DAVIS gave the opening report, during which he discussed the role

of the CP. He said the CP 1s not in a position to solve the

many organizational questions facing the Negro movement, but

can establish a secure base in this movement 1f it developes

and demonstrates a sound line and policy.

He asked why the CP

must always be discussing how to assoclate with existing movements

and said the Party must take more Initiative and organize

Independent movements around the needs of the people. He said

the CP must act boldly and that the entire CP must be involved

In the Negro people's struggle.

JAMES JACKSON, at this meeting, said that the CP has

not recruited from the cream of the crop of the Negro people's

movement and that the leaders of the Negro people's movement are

not associating themselves with the CP.

He said this has to be a

direction of the CP's work.

"The Worker"

The Party, at the present time, through'it right

, Is giving considerable coverage to civil rights

actions throughout the United States and editorially is calling

Ior a strong civil rights bill. It also has backed demonstrations

such as the school boycotts of public schools.

II.

Communist Influence on SCIC

and Its Leaders

The SCIC operation in New York has been, until recently,

at 312 West 125th Street, New York City. The function of this

office appears to be that of operating the mailing procedures of

This operation was handled successiully by

HUNTER PITTSIQ'DELL, also known as JacHyO'Dell, and was directed

primarily toward mailings of fund appeals for the SCLC. O'DELL,

however, was dismissed from the SCLC by MARTIN LUTHER KING in the

Summer of 1963, following public disclosure in the press of his

Communist background.

O'DELL recently is reported to have stated

that he has not seen

MARTIN LUTHER KING since June, 1963.

Following O'DELL's dismissal, the operation of the

New.

York Office of the SCIC floundered under the direction of

RUTH BAILEY, an employee who had worked there for o'DELL,

Letic

New York has no subversive Information concerning BAILEY.

However,

It is felt that because of her possible dismissal

from the SCLO, she can be the subject of a counterintelligence

effort nette alrea

the SCLo

As regards the operation of the, New mork Office of

and personal contacts with MARTIN LUTHER

persong who are now directly involved are CLARENCEXJONES and

STANLEN LEVISON.

In addition, BAYARD RUSTIN is being considered

for a position

with KING and the SCLC, but it does not appear

that he will accept this post.

The following Information.

165641

concerns these three Individual.

STANLEY LEVISON, along with CLARENCE JONES, 1s One of

the prime movers in the SCLC.

As a close confidant of kInd,..

LEVISON has been instrumental in setting policy in the SCLO.

He normally meets with KING each time he visits the New York

area, and has made trips to Atlanta to consult on matters.

As of July, 1963, LEVISON was a secret member of the

CPUSA. In late 1963 and early 1964, he criticized the CP for

not being sufficiently militant in the civil rights struggle.

LEVISON was described by certain CP leaders as being to the

"Ieft" of the CP in his position on civil rights, and because

of these differences with CP leaders, LEVISON Is not now under

CP discipline in the civil rights field. There. has been no

indication, however, that LEVISON does not continue his

ideological adherence to Communism.

Following LEVISON's criticism of the Party, BEN DAVIS

was designated to be the intermediary between LEVISON and the

Party. However, there has been no Indication that LEVISON has

made any attempt to contact DAVIS, HALL or anyone else In the

Party.

CLARENCE JONES is a Negro attorney who, in addition to

practicing law with LUBELL, LUBELL and JONES, 1s the General

Counsel for the Gandhi Society for Human Rights, 15 East 40th

Street, New York CIty. JONES also represents MARTIN LUTHER

leadership in the Labor Youth League LL, which has beer

lesignated pursuant to Executive Order 10450. JONES 15 quite

frequently In contact with STANLEY LEVISON and in these contacts

they have discussed problems relating

to MARTIN LUTHER KING and

his activities, the SCLC In Atlanta, the operation of the SCIC

office In New York and civil rights in general. One function which

JONES serves at the present time is intermediary between LEVISON

and KING since direct contact between LEVISON and KING has been

on a limited basis. It is to be noted that no information has

been developed that CLARENCE JONES has been in contact with any

oIlicials of the CPUSA or that any effort has been made by CPUSA

Coordinator for the SCLC. However, this seems to be somewhat

in doubt at this time, because RUSTIN prefers to operate in an

Independent capacity,

and due to the reluctance of KING to appoint

him at this time.

Recently, indications were that RUStIN was setting up

the A. Phillip Randolph Institute, whose purpose will be to deal

with economic and social problems in relation to civil rights..

It is not belleved that RUSTIN is going to accept the

referenced position in the SCLC, which would preclude contact with

KING and other SCIC leaders.

Furthermore, there has not been

any Indication that he has contacted

any. CP leaders except

BENJAMIN J. DAVIS. He asked DAVIS' advice as to how he could

escape from speaking at a rally sponsored by the Emergency

Committee: for Disaster' Relief to Cuba. Although RUSTIN contacted

DAVIS, it is not believed that he is in contact with other CP

leaders, or that he is sympathetic to the CP cause. Io

substantiate this, RUSTIN as late as April 9, 1964, after

RUSTEN as hate

addressing a meeting of the National Council of the Fellowship

of Reconciliation, Nyack, New York, said he was opposed to the

communist movement.

He said there was no ultimate principle

or position in their movement; that he learned first-hand of the

Communists' desire to submerge the goal of social justice as a

former member of the Youth Communist League before and after

the end of World War II.

noted that in the recent past, DAVIS has been in contact with

BAYARD RUSTIN.

„In view of this information, it is being recommended

that NY, 1869-S*

To put the matter in proper perspective, let me agnin state that

Mr. Hoover believes there is a great nood to inform the public goneroily, and

particularly those dedicated indiridanis who are setirely engaged in the civi.

of the leading ciril rigats or unizationd that those will increece in freency in

the months abead. You are aware that many of these demonstrations huve

resulted in considerable violence.

Coupied with this is the history of communist tactics which

includo the use of violence in public domonstrations. That is why the ciser and

irrefutable fact of communist efforts to capitalize von racial demondirations

and disturbances is oi suci intense importance at this time--ior it constitutes

not only a serious and potentiaily growin; problem to law enforcement arcacies,

who must preserve law and onder, out also a threat to the lives and eniuty of

Mr. Edwin O. Cuthman

I note that this theme still predominates in your memorangum,

particularly in the six numbered points on Pages 1 and 2. With respect to

these six points, let me reiterate what I told you last Friday:

(1.) Regarding items 1 and & concerning the estent of commuist

infiltration in the civil richts movement, you indicate that Mr. Icover's

anawer "blanketed all Negroes." As I rescácily pointed out to you,

Mr. Roover's opening sentence is, "Let meärst emphasize that I

realize that the vast majority of l'egroes have rejected and recognized

communism for what it is." I further empissizodthat, in addition to

Stanley Levison and unter O'Dell, there ama number ol legro and

white communists and persons undor commuiat intuence toking an

active part in the civil rights movement. Kotonly did I name several

of these persons to you, but I aiso ervised ya that this information

about them had boen fumished to the Dapartnent of dustice and was

Vas will "sonll arnitting that you were not

conversant with this material.

(2.) Regarding item 3, I feel that you still niss the point, since the

very militancy of the groups active in this movement is the ingredient

which communists and others advocating violnce seeis to exploit.

(3.) Regarding item 1, these additional wore were incomorated in

the tinal statement by lix. Hoover, which youapproved and which was

given to Mir. vandenberg.

(4.) Regarding items 5 and 6, your misundesstanding of the purpose

and objective of Mr. Hoover's reply clearly nanitests itselt in these

two points.

Item 6 suggests that your sole cosideration in reviewing

Mir. Hoover's statement was the impact it poisibly might have on the

pending civil rights legislation.

As Inspector Wick and I told you, Miz. Hoover's short factual

answers to these questions were intended to bring gecific facts before the public.

His views concerning the need to protect and enhanorthe rights of all citizens

have been reiterated tize and again over the years.nd, in fact, have been

clearly expressed in major speeches by iar. Hooverwhich you personally have

read and approved. Your memorandum makes it char to me that your entire

objection to lar. Hoover's answers to Mir. Vandenberg's questions was that

publication might be detrimental to the civil rigins cause. Actually, we greater

canger hes in a failure to recognize and challenge the communsis and otner

spolesmen for violence who attempt to capitalize on the militancy of the sincere

advocates of equal rights.

I an enclosing a copy of (1) the original answer as prepared by

Mix, Hoover and (2) the revised version which was approved by you. Certainly,

the fact that ow discussion resuited in agreement is evidence that no stand

fast policy or "adamancy" existea.

At the bottom of Page 3 and the top of Page 4 of your day 8th

ITEM 1

Question:

You have been quoted as saying there are communists in the

civil rights movement. Are these men in positions.d leadership? How

much influence do they have on the civil rights movement?

Answer:

Let me first einphasize that I realize that the vast majority of

Negroes have rejected and recognized communism for what it is. However,

the infiltration, exploitation, and control of the Negro population for many

years has been one of the top goals of the Communist Party, USA. Communist

interest is not based on such noble ideals as iraproving the status or condition

of the Negro in this country. Its purpose, pure and simple, is the uitimate

advancement of communiet chiectives of domination, control and conquest

of zill it touches.

A special target of the Communist Party among the Negroes

is the exploitation of the militant forces of the Negro civil rights movement.

This exploitation is carried out through active members of the Communist

Party and individuals who are under communist influence and control.

The existence and importance of the communist influence in

the Negro movement cannot be ignored or minimized. The Communist Party

" will use its forces either in the open forum of public opinion or tho ugh its

sympathizers who do not wear the badge of communism but who spout some

of the same ideas carried in the Communist Party line. This is the influence

which is capable of moving large masses of loyal and dedicated citizens toward

communist objectives while being lured away from the true issues involved.

ITEM 2

Questión: •

You have been quoted as saying there are communiats in the civil rizis

movement.

Are these men in positions of leadership: How much influence do they

have on the civil rights movement?

Answer:

Let me first emphasize that I realize that the vast majority of Negroes

have rejected and recognized communism for what it is. However, the infiltration,

exploitation, and control of the Negro population for many years has been one of the

top goals of the Communist Farty, USA. Communist interest is not based on such

noble ideals as improving the status or condition of the Negro in this country. Its

purpose, pure and simple, is the ultimate advancament of communist objectives of

domination, control and conquest of all it touches.

The communists have always tried to make headway by playing on

emotion, faith and injustice and it is inevitable that they have tried and will continue

to try to exploit Negro militance for civil rights. Actire members of the Communist

Party and individuals who are under communist influence and control continually

attempt to work their way into civil rights organizations They have had some

success, but many failures.

The existence and importance of the conmunist influence in the Negro

movement should not be ignored or minimized, nor should it be exaggeraied. The

Communist Party will use its forces either in the openforum of public opinion or

through its sympathizers who do not wear the badge of communism but who spout some

of the same ideas carried in the Communist Party line. This is the influence which

le capable of moving large masses of loyal and dedicated citizens toward communist

objectives while being lured away from the true issues involved. It is up to the civil

rights organizations themselves to recognize this andice up to it.

DocId: 32989648

Late yesterday afternoon, Bob wick of the FBI brought over.

for clearance answers to tro sets of questions submitted to Mr. Hoorer

by the Associated Press and United Press International.

I made several suggestions and raised a serious question

about Mr. Hoover's answer to the UPI question:

"you have been quoied

as

saying there are comminists in the civil rights movement.

Are

these men in positions of leadership? How much influence do they

have on the civil rights movement?"

I based my objection on the total impact. of Mr. Hoover's

answer which, in my opinion, put communist influence in the civil

rights movement out of perspective. I made the following points in

talking with Bob Wick:

1.

The answers blanketed all Negroes without making the

point that most of the communists in the Negro move

ment are white. I said the only important white

communist that I new was Stanley Levinson who

advises Martin Luther King, and that almost all the

others are on the fringes of the Negro organization.

2.

Negro communists in the civil rights movement did

not hold positions of leadership. I said I know

only of O'Dell and that he appeared to have been

moved out.

3.

Negroes are so militant over the denial of their

rights that communist influence is not needed to

Ioment the, demonstrations--they are occurring out

of Negro resentment and not because of comminist

infiltration.

4.

I referred to the line in Mr. Hoover's answer which

said "the existence and importance of the communist

Influence in the Negro movement cannot be ignored

or minimized"; and suggested that the phrase "also

should not be exaggerated" should be added.

5.

The answer as a vicole was totally negative and

I contended that it a statement like that were made,

It was also necessary to point out that the way to

stop the communists iron gaining strength in the

civil rights movement is to make progress toward

eliminating discrimination.

I felt strongly that Mr. Hoover's answer would have

a very adverse effect on the civil rights bill.

Wick strongly supported Mi. Hoover's statement and after

discussing the matter brierly, I said that I could not clear this

statement because of the adverse effect it would have on the civil

rights bill. I said unless it were changed, it should go to the

White House for clearance.

Wick left the office about 7:00 p.m.

This forenoon, Deke Deloach and Bob Wick returned with the

statement and Deloach informed me that Mr. Hoover was standing last;

that le felt the statement was accurate and the truth; and that it

should be published.

I repeated my position.

- Deloach read the first paragraph of the statement and asked

me If there was anything in there that was not tria. 1 salù ünere was'ù.

He reaâ the secona paragrapin which said that the Negroes are a prime

communist target and that active members of the Communist Party and

indiviauals no are under communist influence are inrluencing the civil

• rights movement.

Martin Luther King's association with Levinson and other

incidents of communist penetration were discussed. DeLoach said that

the communists, through Martin Iuther King, had a strong voice in the

civil rights movement and that because King occupied a position of top

leadership, the paragraph was correct.

I said that standing alone this paragraph ascribed too much

power and influence to the communists; that some qualification was

needed indicating that while the communists had made some penetration,

they had also had many failures and that the communists always tried

to capitalize on social turmoil.

We discussed this and talked about possible changes.

could not come to an agreement and passed on to the thira paragraph.

I suggested that the phrase "nor should it be exaggerated"

be added to the first sentence.

DeLoach agreed.

He read the rest

of the paragraph and we discussed it. He said it was accurate as it

stood and was an important part of the answer. I felt it did not tell

HY 33179 DooId: 32989648 Page 601

---

## Page 602

=3=

the whole story and that some language was needed to indicate that:

(1) It was up to civil rights organizations to recognize the communist

problem and lace up to it; and (2) that coumunist efforts to infiltrate

the civil rights movement should not distract us fron the fact that

aiscrimination exists, and that particularly the white majority must

take action to ena discrimination.

DeLoach was agreeable to point one but not to point two,

and we discussed that lor a considerable period oi time.

DeLoach

said that Mr. Hoover could not "philosophize"; trat he was the head oi

an investigative agency ana could only tell what the investigations

would show. I said that Mr. Hoover's position was such in the country

that he was not just an ordinary Bureau head; that his word on this

subject was gospel with millions of Americans.

I said that the civil rights problem was a diffenant problem

than had ever faced this country before and that it was extremely

important that men in Mr. Hoover's position give leadership.

I also

said that any statement which would adversely affect President Jonson's

position on the civil rights bill would be a disservice to the President

and to the country.

•"=*

DeLoach disagreed that the statement would adversely affect

the bill. During the long discussion over this point, Deloach said that

perhaps the best thing to do was simply to withdraw the statement if we

wanted to "suppress" it. I said that he knew I was not trying to superess

anything; that what I was trying to do was to get a statement on communist

not that his tone to ha

infiltration in the civil rights movement that was exactly in perspective.

DeLoach repeatedly reminded me that Mc. Hoover's statement vas

the truth and that Mr. Hoover's position was highly respected in the

United States because he always told the truth.

I said at least once that I felt Mr. Hcover's answer as submitted

to me distorted the extent of communist influence in the civil rights

movement-a statement which DeLoach todissue with strongly.

We went back to the second paragraph and after further discussios,

L typea out the language as it now appears, and Daloach accepted iu.

• He said he felt that my changes had watered down the statement because j:

was talking about the future and the past, and not about the present.

I didn't quite understand this point but said Il he was not..

satisfied with it this way, that I woula be glad to see that the original

statement was sent to the White House, and ii President Johnson wished to

clear It, I would accept that decision.

DeLoach asked me 1I I would take It to Walter Jenkins. I said

that I would not; that my dealings in the White House were with George

= 4=

Reedy and Bill Moyers.

He said that he could take the statement over

to Walter Jenkins, but that he thought the thing for us to do was to

sit down and resolve our differences which we had done to a large

extent.

I made one more appeal for one line at the end which would

say something to the eifect that we should not let the communist

threat divert us from the fact that discrimination exists and must

be eliminated. But Deloach was adamant that Mr. Hoover would never

say that because it would be

"sermonizing" and "philosophizing."

Deloach said that the statement as it was finally draited

was weaker than Mr. Hoover's statement before the House Appropriations -

Subcommitiee. He also said; that Mr. Hoover was the only person who

was alerting the country to the communist danger in the civil rights

movement.

Historically the Communist Party, USA, has regarded

Negroes as a primary target group for agitation,

and recruitment.

Negroes have been subjected constantly to

intensive and extensive communist propaganda. The Communist

Party seizes upon any opportunity presented to exploit the

racial issue.

Martin Luther King and his Southere Christian

Leadership Conterence have, over the years, received advice

and guidance iron' such dedicated communists as Stanley Levison

and Hunter Pitts O'Dell, a former national leader in the

Conmunist Party. C. T. Vivian, an official in the southern

Christian Leadership Conference, is a former communist.

Lavisor went to Atlanta, Genrgia

: to confer with king during

the June, 1966, march from Memphis to Jackson. He was in

nicago to confer with King in connection with King's activities

for open housing in August of 1966.

Clarence-Jones, Harry

lachtel, and Bayard austin, all with histories of prior

communist affiliation, have also been close advisors of King

land his organization.

Basically each riot which has occurred in the

United States since the Summer of 1964 followed a single

incident generally involving efforts on the part of police to

effect an arrest of a Negro.

The Communist Party and other

subversive organizations exploited the riots aftetathes at

area. William Epton, national vice chairman of this organiza-

tion and a former menber of the Communist Party, organized and

led young Negroes in fighting the police during the riot. In

an inflammatory street speech he warned "

'...we are going to

have to kill a lot of these cops, a lot of these judges and we

"will have to go up against the Army...." His activities in

fomenting and adding to the disorder led to his arrest and

subsequent conviction on charges of crininal anarchy.

The

Communist Party, USA, of course, and other communist-type

organizations had a propaganda field day.

In addition, on July 19, 1964, Jesse Gray, a Iormer

organiser of the Harlem region of

the Communist Party, called

for one hundred single revolutionaries who were ready

to die

to correct what he termed the police brutality situation in

Harlem.

PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA

Following an attempted arrest of a Negro woman in

a predominantly Negro neighborhood in Philadelphia,

group and former member of the Nation of Islam which preaches

hatred against the whites, mounted the porch of a house urging

the people who had gathered at the scene to violence against

police officers and thereafter the crowd began attacking police

land throwing stones and bricks at passing cars.

The following

two days saw riotous conditions in the area. During the course

of the riots, members of the Communist Party, USA, Were

observed distributing numerous copies of "The Worker," the

East Coast communist newspaper, in the riot area. Hayes was

arrested by the Philadelphia police and among other things

charged with inciting to riot.

A subsequent search of his

home revealed knives, an automatic pistol,

fifty gallons of

flammable liquid and

a quantity of communist-Marxist literature.

. LOS ANGELES

Communists were quick to exploit the Watts area

riot in Los Angeles, August 11-15, 1965. On August 14, 1965,

members of the W. E. B. DuBois Clubs, a communist youth

organization, and the Socialist Workers Party, a communist

Trotskyite organization, staged a demonstration at the police

administration building

and on August 16, 1965, the DuBois

RE:

SUBVERSIVE INFLUENCE IN RIOTS

Club members circulated leaflets calling for expulsion of

the Los Angeles Chief of Police. Communist Party members

prepared articles for a communist publication written in

an eifort to place blame for the riot on local authorities.

The leader of another procommunist China communist splinter

group stated in October, 1965, that his group had spent over

two years carrying on agitation against the police in the

Watts area.

He added that his group was engaged in the

formation

and development of units and squads to fight against

"police brutality" and "United States imperialism" which could,

lin the future, provide the basis for "liberation armies.",

During the riot which erupted in the Watts area in

Los Angeles on March 15, 1966, the Southside Defense Committee,

which was set up by the Communist Party, held a press conference

protesting alleged police brutality in connection with the

arrest of four members of the W. E. B. DuBois Clubs who were

lin the riot area.

A disturbance which occurred in the Watts area of

Los Angeles on May 17, 1966, is directly attributed to actions

of the communists who organized the rally at the will Rogers

Park in the Watts area to protest the killing of a Negro,

Leonard Deadwyler.

An inflammatory handbill announcing

rally was prepared by a Communist Party nember and following

the rally approximately five hundred incividuals led by a

paid organizer of the W. E. B. DuBois Club who was driving

an automobile equipped with loud-speakers proceeded to the

77th Street Division of the Los Angeles Police Department

where they staged a boisterous picketing demonstration. A

I news vehicle was attacked and one occupant seriously wounded,

a liquor store window was broken and looted; bottles and bricks

were hurled at passing cars.

An inquest into the death of

Deadwyler on May 19, 1966, was disrupted to such an extent by

unruly spectators that it

had to be recessed. The Progressive

(Labor Party, a violence-prone pro-Chinese communist organization,

got into the

act during the inquest by distributing a leaflet

captioned "Wanted for the Murder of Leonard Deadwyler, Bova,

a Cop." At the courthouse while the inquest was in progress,

the Communist Party circulated a petition calling Ior Indict-

ment of the officer involved in the shooting.

CLEVELAND

In connection with riots which began in the Hough

area of Cleveland,

Ohio, on the night of July 18, 1966

Cuyahoga Grand Jury reported that "The outbreak of lawlessness

and disorder was both organized, precipitated and exploited

by a relatively small group of

trained

and disciplined

professionals of this business.

They were aided and abetted

willingly or otherwise by misguided people of all ages and

colors, many of whom are avowed believers in violence and

extremists and some of whom are also either members of or

officers in the Communist Party."

A prior disturbance had begun on the night of

June 22, 1966, in the vicinity of the Jil House, a private

community center in Cleveland, which continued nightly througs

пот

June 25, 1966. The Bureau sources, as well as sources of the

Cleveland Police Department, agree that the June disturbance

was organized by leaders and members of the JFk House and

JFk youths were primarily involvea.

of the JFK House have been affiliated with the Revolutionary

Action Movement, an all-Negro

black nationalist procommunist

China organization, whose nominal leader is Robert I. Williass,

a fugitive from justice now residing in Communist China.

addition to their involvement in the June disturbance, the

grand jury reported that these leaders caused two thousand

pieces

Of literature to be printed and circulated citing

alleged incidents of "police brutality" on the eve of the

Hough area riots in July.

The greatest numver of these were

circulated to youths of non-voting age under the guise of urging

the defeat of a levy at the polls,

and while not instigating

the July riots, the JFK House people did exploit the Hough area

"during the course of the riots.

According to a police undercover agent, a member of

the Communist Party in Cleveland, contact was made with

Lewis G. Robinson, the head of the JIk House by a member of

the Communist Party, and offered Communist Party support.

This was done at the instructions of the District Organizer of

the Communist

Party in Cleveland.

In addition, Robinson is

known to have attended public functions of the

Socialist

Workers Party in Cleveland in 1965 and 166 and, in tact,

was among those arrested by the Clevelami Police Department in

Novenber, 1965, during a disturbance at a Socialist Workers

Party-sponsored public function. Robinson's wife visited

cuba in 19ol and ta fact, was employed by the Ministry of

education while

in Cuba.

She traveled without State Depart-

ment permission.

She has also attended Socialist Workers

Party public functions.

Communist contacts with Robinson

occurred prior to the

July 18 riot with the last contact

being July 14, 1966.

During the course of the Hough area riots, four

members of the l. E. B. DuBois Club were arrested in the

riot area vith a considerable amount of communist literature

in the car. In this

connection it is noted that the Dubois

Club headquarters had been set up in the Hough area of Cleveland.

•CHICAGO

During a disturbance in Chicago in August,

leaflets containing intlanatory statements vere distributad

in the troubler ares hy members of Sparticist, a Trotskyite

organization, composed of former members of the Socialist

Workers Party. The leaflets compared the riot situation in

Chicago to Vietnam and Santo Domingo.

During the course of the Chicago riot which began

July 12, 1966, Douglas Andrews, the leader of a civil rights

organization and also a former

member of the Revolutionary

Action lovement, together with twelve other members of the

civil rights organization, were arrested by the Chicago Police

Department following receipt of infornation that they were

preparing

Molotov cocktails for use later in the riot area.

DETROIT

In Detroit on August 9, 1966, a riotous situation

developed following an attempt by police to arrest three

Negroes.

The same night, General Gordon Baker, Jr., a leader

of the Revolutionary Action lovement, and several of his

associates were arrested by police.

These individuals were

in possession of weapons and were

en route to the riot area.

In all of the above and similar situations, the

Communist Party has seized every opportunity to exploit the

situation, to set itself up as the "champion" of social

protest,

and to portray itself as

the "leader" in the

struggle for full and equal rights. In other words, the

Conmunist Party wants to "keep the pot boiling" by any

possible means.

Memorandum for W. C. Sullivan

RE:

SUVERSIVE AND EXTREMIST.

ELEMENTS IN RACIAL VIOLENCE

RESEARCH-SATELLITE MATTER

the past three years highlight the enormous success achieved

other minority groups.

mis study analyzes racial riots ana disturbances

against the background of known comnunist, aims, and objectives.

'It shows that communists seek to advance their

cause by in-

jecting themselves into racial situations and exploiting them.

In analyzing the riots and disturbancessor the past-

three years, this study also deals with other factors which

have contributed to racial

turmoil and violence. It notes

that a certain susceptible segment of the Negro population

has been aroused and influenced by demagogic public statements

of prominent persons--notably civil rights leaders-which have

encouraged, aduncatan

no condoned lawlessness and civil dis-

obedience.

This has had the effect of relieving the partici-

pants in mob action of all responsibility for their reckless

actions.

In addition, it is noted that the nationvide pub-

licity given to riotous activity in one locality has served

• to stimulate impressible people in other areas of the country

to mass action.

From this study, it is apparent that the net result

of the racial activities of communists and other subversives

and extremists has been to promote an increasing breakdown of

respect for law and order_ across the

•Nation and a flagrant

disregard for the personal and property rights of our citizens.

Moreover, their activities have played a major role in pol

soning the atmosphere and in creating a climate of conflict

between the races.

The enclosed document has been proofread by the

• Reading Room.

Upon approval, it should be returned to the

• Research-Satellite Section for printing and distribution.

RECOMMENDATION:

That this document, the yellow copy of which is

enclosed, be approved for dissemination by letter to the

Honorable Harvin latson, Special Assistant to the President;

Chicago

In August, 1966, Chicago was the scene of a series of

civil rights narches spearheaded by Martin Luther Eing's

Christian Leadershiy Conference and the Chicago Freedom Hovement

into white neighborhoods domanding open housing. Those marches

aroused bitter and retaliatory white reaction. On August 7, some

1,500 civil rights demonstrators marched through a crowd of

some

2,000 jeering, rock-throwing whites in an all-white neighborhood of

Chicago's Northwest Side to demand an end to housing discrimination.

One knot of counter-demonstrators corried the banner of the NSRP,

American Nazi Party

The American Nazi Party (ANP), another white hate group

which preaches and promotes antagonisn toward Negroes, Jews, and

communists, is led by George Lincoln Rockwell. ANP membership is

estimated to be less than 200. In the same manner as the Klan and

the National States Rights Party, the ANP engages in activities

calculated to create disorder in

conjunction with civil rights

denonstrations.

The AMP has headquerters in klington, Virginia,

but Rockwell and his aides make frequent appearances in areas where

racial tension exists.

throwaway denounced "black pover," "blood-thirsty, black savages,"

and

"rampaging black seun." It also stated that

Rochwell and his

associates were prepared to train white mon for "anti-insurrection

Power of News Media

During the past three years, some Negro leaders have period

ically issued ominous predictions of violence io cone, naned specific

citles as targets for organized civil rights activity, or varned that

as many as several score of cities were ripe for riots.

These

inflammatory statements have been given nation-wide publicity in the

press, on television, and over the radio.

Provocative statements

such as these have only served to arouse

Negroes to mass action and

violence.

Representatives of the news media have frequently been so

sctive in their coverage of a riot that they have tended to generate

excitement anong the rioting elements.

During the course of many of

the riots and disturbances, radio and

1 televIsion incerviers have

conducted with the participants, thereby affording sell-seeking

individuals an opportunity to circulate wild and unfounded unors,

especially of so-called "police brutality." These interviews have

heaped fuel on the fire by attracting others to the riot area.

JESSE WILL JARD GRAY

Jesse Williard Gray is a Negro male born May 11, 1923,

at Tunica, Louisiana. He resides at 41-15 Vernon Boulevard,

Long Island City, New York, and is employed as Director of the

Community Council on Housing, 300 West 121st Streot, New York,

New York. Since November, 1958, he has been engaged in

organizing tenants in the Harlem area of New York City. Gray

is also Director of the Organization for Black Power (this

organization fully decribed elsewhere in this summary).

He has recently come into prominence in connection

with the Harlem rent strike in which tenants were organized

to refuse payment of rent until certain housing conditions

were corrected. He is also originator of "Bring a Rat to Court"

campaign whereby tenants were encouraged to bring a rat either

live or dead into court when eviction cases were being heard in

order to dramatize housing conditions. ("The New York Times,"

12/31/63)

In connection with the "stall in" campaign at the

opening of the 1964 World's Fair in New York City, the

April 24, 1964, edition of the "New York Herald Tribune" quotes

Gray as saying he had sent 20 cars but had held off on his

threat to show upattle opening ceremonies with live rats to be

turned loose in the crowd.

the self-control wich Negro integrationists use in their

non-violence campaign for equality is reaching the breaking
