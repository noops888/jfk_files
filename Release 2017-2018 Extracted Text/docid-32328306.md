involving ARTIE CRESPO, Attorney MANUEL "MANNY""

JAMES,

ISMAEL GARCIA, and others.

The Miami Div. advised that the name "ARTIE"

listed after telephone number of PATRICIA CLARKE, IS

apparently in reference to ARTEMIO CRESPO, aka "ARTIE,"

who has long

been the bolita banker in the greater Key West,

Fla. area.

Previous investigations conducted by Miami

have identified CLARKE as being

CRESPO'S mistress, which

association

she has maintained

for approximately 5 years.

CRESPO is known to use CLARKE'S residence, 404 Balido,

Stock Island (adjacent to Key West), and her telephone

for purposes of conducting his gambling and narcotics

operations. A former Miami source, MM 2778-PCI, who was

acquainted

with CLArkE, advised that ChARNe, herselt, was

not an active participant in CRESPO'S operations, and was

largely ignorant about the extent and nature of his activities.

CRESPO'S personal residence at 1404 Patricia St.

West, Fla., was

raided by Agents of the Elorida Department

of Law Enforcement (FDLE), on 5-15-72, and numerous items of

gambling paraphernalia were confiscated at that time.

The

raid followed 3 months of extensive surveillance activity

by the FDLE

Although the results of that raid were

proposed action, the case was returned to Monroe County, Fla.

for local prosecution on 2-6-73.

Pursuant to this, CRESPO

with violation of State of florida Lottery Laws, and Conspiracy

to Violate Fla:

Lottery Laws.

He was indicted by a Monroe Co.

Grand Jury, and is presently free on bond pending trial on

these charges.

On 3-15-73, MM 2786-PCI, who has furnished reliable

information in the past

activities in Key West, Fla

advised he was unaware of any

gambling or organized crime links between CAGNINA and ARTEMIC

CRESPO, although in his opinion,

this was entirely possible

in view of their individual involvement in criminal operations.
