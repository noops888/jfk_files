Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

".:

Unilateral Coverage:

From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947 until

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in

Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK)

isted of multiline

phone taps, three photographic sites, a mobi

unveillance team and a

mail intercept operation.

Telephone taps (LIFEAS

a si aced by an emprayee of the tocal

telephone company who

adled by a Station

case officer. The number

of lines tapped was

datited only by the availability of a listening post

nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,

Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-

• American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer

assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station

on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These

operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC

and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-

bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and. a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

• Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned

street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).

LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental

basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

tion received word that the photograph of the "unidentified man" was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site bu

Embassy. LICALLA, the third photographi

purpose of this opera

nowas to get good identification photographs of

cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother

and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the

LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-

veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips.

LICALLA film was

originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-

nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.

These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents

which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team

could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of

interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of

the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for

identification purposes.

1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a joint telephone tap

operation came into existence. The operation, which became known as

LIENVOY, was run by a Mexican officer. The listening post had 30 lines

connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican

Army officers. In 1961, because of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-

cipals, the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A

Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening

post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes. There was also

an American technician inside the listening post.

3. Oswald Coverage:

In mid-1962, the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (the

joint tap operation) asked the American officer at the fervoY listening

post for the telephone numbers of the Sovlet, Cuban satellite In-

reafter connected five Cuban lines, five

Soviet lines, three Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav

line. At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of

conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume

for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,

full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two.

ir a language other than Spanish or English were taken to another location

for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-

tions but because of the volume of Russian conversations, the translations

usually ran about a week behind the date of the conversation.

As soon as the Station learned that an American identifying him-

self as Lee Oswald phoned the Soviet Embassy, Miss Ann Goodpasture of the

Station started screening all photographs. However, here

again, there

was a backlog because the photographs were picked up

were conscientious. The Cuban Embassy coverage had more sophisticated

equipment using a pulse camera which frequently developed mechanical dif-

ficulties.

There was some delay because Station personnel waited to compare the

photographs with the typed transcript. All transcripts were made in

these two languages and because he personally screened the transcripts

the Station got word that the photo of "uniden man" was being releasea to the

public by

the Warren Connission. The photo operators were moved to another apt

nearby. The property was sold (under an operational agreement with LIMOUSINE

for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment blding to be built

on this site). LILYRIC was planned as an alternate photo base to LINITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the sare side of the street

the front gate of the Soviet Enbassy. The agents in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both

of the lexican services at that time. The Mexican DES (Direction of Federal

Security) with which ve dealt was a hip pocket group run out of the vinistry

Of Gov:rnment.

This linistry spent a rajor part of its tire on control of

foreigners and solitical investigations. Their agents vere vicious, venal,

corrupt extortionists. Robert Melberg established

During 1958, Jir Scott met socially some of the chronies of the

Mexican President elect, Adolfo Lopez lateos.

During this period, the J.S.

Ambassador Robert C. Hill (reflecting the policy of then Sec State J.F. Dulles)

was energetic in organizing groups to "fight communism".

of these seeds

grew into a proposal Miguel Aleman (jr. son of former lexi President), acting

for Loçez lateos, made to Win Scott for a joint telephone tap operation. This

project (LIENVOY) went through about four distressing years of a shakedown.

The lexican in control (LIELEGANT) was inexperienced, old, and greedy. His

son (LIE!VOY-2) was a masterpiece of deceit and corruption. LIELEGANT also

manipulated control over the principal agent

of LIBIGHT mail intercept. The

About nid 1962 (check date) Litvoy outside lexi rept asked

for the telephone nunvers of the Soviet, Cuban, and Satellite Ebassies.

With this forewarning, LIFEAT (unilateral coverage) was disconnected. However,

as I recall, the Mexicans connected 5 Cuban lines, 5 Soviet lines, 3 Czech,

2 Polish, and I lugoslav line. The basehouse listening

post had a live

nonitor wco mede short sumnaries of interesting conversations for a daily

resume which was received each day arourd 8 a.u. (passed by Flick to Goodcasture

to get to Scott before 9.a..) Later (when the reel was completely recorded)

full transcripts were typed and passed to the

station in the same way, however,

there was usually a time lag of a day or

so. Those transcripts which rad

Russien or another language besides Spanish or English went

out of the listening

post the day after the transcript (of otter conversations on the reel)was

typed. Theise reels were taken to another locationare they vere translated

and typed. In the case of the Russian translations, Boris Tarasoff usually ran

about a week behind the date aries

aversation bacause of the volume of

Russian conversations am

decembers of the Soviet Eubassy. During this

period (fall of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the station

and carried to Boris by one of the people from the Soviet Section or they may

have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and

gave

it to Herbert Manell to take to Boris. Herbert Manall and his wife Barbera

handled all of the processi:g of Soviet transcripts. ly job involved screening

the photographs. as soon as we learned that the man calling hinself Oswald was

probably an Anerican.

However, here again there was a backlag because the

photos were picked up three times a week but the ones ricked up were usually

for dates a few days previously because the doctor processed the film on a

night time basis. Photographs were made usually until one roll vas used but

later we got it changed to one day coverage on each roll - in other words the

operators, cleared the camera each day wother there was angrikas a full

roll of film exposed. Instructions were to cover office hours, photograch each

error did occur but generally the azents vere conscientious.

The Cuban

embassy coverage had more sophisticated equipient (a gulse ca:era) but it

frequently develored rechanical difficulties. Bob Zanbarnardi and Spatkar

(I think) handled this film - pick up and delivery. Lorna l'ackay screened

the film inside the station.

I am certain that the Oswald call came to our attention from the

Soviet line.. It was picked up

and taken to Boris for a translation because

the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay was caused by waiting to

compare the photographs with the typed transcript. There were no copies of

transcrists every made in languages other than Spanish or

lish because Win

Scott could read only those two languages ard

The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute.

DURAN gives her name

she has moved and

THEN LEAVE FOR CUBA, OR DID HE PLAN TO RETURN TO THE STATES FIRST

AND THEN LEAVE LATER• ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS THAT HE WAS THEN THINKING

ONLY ABOUT A PEACEFUL CHANGE OF RESIDENCE TO THE SOVIET UNION,

IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT HE WAS GETTING DOCUMENTED TO MAKE A QUICK

ESCAPE AFTER ASSASSINATING THE PRESIDENT•

DEPARTMENT OF STATE

THE DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE AND RESEARCH

WASHINGTON

SECRET

OCT 25 1960

Dear Dick:

Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including some

from the White House Staff, have revealed that,

though CIA and the

FEI have detailed records concerning Americans who have been recruited

as Intelligence agents by Bloc

countries,

there does not appear to be

a complete listing of those Americans now living In Bloc countries

who might be called "defectors". Using the definitions of DID l/2,

these porsons might be described as those who have either been

capable of provicing useîul intelligence to the Bloc or those whose

desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited

for communist propaganda purposes.

This would mean that no attention

need be paid to Americans whose resettlement within the Bloc had no

counter intelligence implications or had attracted no particular

attention; for instance, this definition rould not cover individual

US citizens of East European or Chinese origin who returned to the

"homeland" because they had never been completely assimilated into

the American society®

There is attached a list of such persons, covering the last 18

months, and it would be appreciated if the Agency could verify and

possibly expand this list for the use of interested Bureaus of, the

Department.

Sincerely yours,

Hugh S. Cumming, Jr.

We weren't given

With regard to E - Mrs, Paine, etc., we are working on that.

between him and the Embassy up there.

'Ie wife is being interrogated. I don't kaow if that took place yesterds

just giving you a preview.

With regard to that, Nicaraguan's; allegations that the man was in the

Cuban Enoassy on 18 September, I understand we do have information that

he applied for a tourist card about the 15th of Segtember. There is a

record showing entry into Mexico on September 26. On abort the 15th he

applied in New Orleans for a tourist cafd.

We do know he was 1n -

I may even have some later information which came in during the nigat -

As you know, he was in ten antears the asth when the family left.

and the landlady said be skipped during the night.

He was last seen by the landlady

Now we have Immigration records showing him

entering Mexico on the 26th which very strongly suggests that he was not in Mexico

on the l8th. What we are trying to find out is where he was every single day -

the 25th, 24th, and all the way back. I think the Nicaraguan story is fabricated
