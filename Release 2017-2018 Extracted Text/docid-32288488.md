MARCY:

color leave it to me I'Il work it out.

Then the kid says I don't care what the hell

you do just see that there's a little in it for

me.

I says I'll take care of that. This guy

gave me a free lance. He isn't even going to

put him in the insurance business.

He doesn't

want him in it. He doesn't want him to know

anything.

It's good that you talked to him. Cause you

know that he is the person that the kid is

going to run to. But now you got the power.

He said if it pertains to the organization tell

him everything, if it's off color, tell him

nothing. So I

can't beat that.

Now you're all set.

Put all them other worries

out of your mind.

Now for JOHN, he's got some

big friends who can talk for him as the

committeeman.

He was made about VITO.

He talked about the

Mayor, the police department. He said he give

that away.

On the police committee.

He's mad at VITO.

I told him now listen I don't have too much

to

do with him.

But I'd probably take the same

attitude that VITO's taking.

He might feel that

if he makes a move he's hurtin' something' that

you got going.

Why don't you tell him to........

some beat.

You know what he says, those (obs)

greaseballs, you got to act like you did in

1920.

He says to me well do it nice and easy.

I said I'll shoot him in the head or chase

him out of the city.

BUTCH would be BUTCH BLASI, a top lieutenant and

chauffeur for GIANCANA.

TONY GIROLAMI is presently the Clerk

of the Probate Court, Chicago, and identical with CG 6498-PC.:

VITO is identical with Alderman VITO MARZULLO of Chicago's /

25th Ward.
