CIA reported all militant

were frustrated and not under complete control. The Matahambre operation

was not mentioned by the CIA in reporting in operational teams inside Cuba,

OCCURRENCE: Fitzgerald states "The activist Cuban exiles will probably not be

deterred by the order (to stop hit and run raids). They may even profit by

the decree. It will now be a greater honor to engage in operations against

Fidel.

The double jeopardy arising from the threat of detention by U.S. agents

and the chance for martyrdom at the hands of Fidel will be an even greater

challenge. Actually the supply of recruits for such hit and run raids may

run shallow but not dry."

OCCURRENCE:

Fitzgerald states it is too soon actually to state definitely

what the effect of this policy (i.e. stopping raids) will have on our recruit-

ment program. The Agency's problem is not the number of recruits, but their

quality.

The unemployed, poorly educated, hungry are always with us. Some of

the more discerning Cuban types will avoid recruitment as they are convinced

that a priciple reason for the U.S. action is to control who fights Castro in

order to insure who will succeed him.

OCCURRENCE: Fitzgerald states Another advantage arising from the scrutiny

of U.S. agents will be the improvement and control and better clandestine

security practices on the part of the exiles. But as the U.S. restricts and

apprehends these men, confiscating goods and funds, the loci power will have

a tendency to move back to its traditional center:

the exile--monied interests

such as the bosches, prios and Batistas.
