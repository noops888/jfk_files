ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCES

All electronic surveillances employed by the FBI in the field

of organized crime are authorized in advance by the Department of Justice

and by a United States District Judge in the form of a Federal court order,

as provided for in Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets

Act of 1968.

CAR-TRACKING DEVICES

These devices, also known in the law enforcement profession

as 'beepers," are miniature transmitting devices attached surreptitiously

to the bumper, fender, or some other part of an automobile so that surveil-

lance vehicles may more easily follow the travels of an individual using

such an automobile.

Authorization for the use of these tracking devices by Bureau

Agents must be obtained from FBI Headquarters on a case-by-case basis,

but no requirement exists that the Department be notified regarding such

authorization. As the result of two recent Federal court decisions, offices

covered by the State of Oregon and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals

(including Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas,

and the Canal Zone must obtain a warrant before using car-tracking

devices.

CONSENSUAL MONITORING DEVICES

Special Agents in Charge of FBI field offices may authorize

the monitoring of telephonic conversations in nonsensitive cases where

one of the participants has given written cons ent and the appropriate

United States Attorney concurs. In cases of extreme sensitivity, authority

must be obtained from Bureau Headquarters. No notification is made

to the Department.

With respect to on-the-body recorders or recording devices

installed on a premises with the permission of one of the participants,

Departmental policy requires that the FBI receive Departmental permission

before attempting such coverage. In certain instances, when the event

to be covered does not give sufficient time for the Bureau to obtain

Departmental permission, the Director or someone designated by him

may authorize the desired on-the-body or premises coverage immediately,

provided that the Department is notified of the full facts in writing promptly

thereafter.

POLYGRAPH EXAMINATIONS

The polygraph (or so-called "lie detector") technique involves

the use of instrumentation with an individual to record psychophysiological

responses during a carefully controlled interrogation in an effort to

determine whether or not deception is indicated. Over the years it has

generally been held to be inadmissible in court although, properly admin-

istered, it can be an invaluable investigative tool.

Because of the continuing: controversy in the public media,

courts, and the scientific community regarding use of the polygraph, the

FBI has adopted a conservative policy and rationale, utilizing it to implement

an interrogation and provide investigative direction without relying on it

solely as a substitute for logical investigation.

In each instance, authority must first be obtained from FBI

Headquarters and a written waiver be signed by the person to be interviewed.

No Departmental permission is required to employ this technique.

CLOSED-CIRCUIT TELEVISION

In addition to its use as a training aid by law enforcement,

closed-circuit television has proved to be an invaluable investigative tool,

particularly in connection with physical surveillances.

Bureau policy regarding this technique varies with the individual

circumstances. Where the units are being installed without trespass

(such as those covering bank entrances, phone booths, and the like), the

only requirement is that permission be obtained in advance from FBI

Headquarters. In these instances, no authorization is obtained from the

Department.

Where there is trespass, however, some sort of court permission

is required. In the case of visual observation alone, court authorization

under Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure will generally

suffice at the present time. If oral interceptions are desired along with

the visual coverage, permission must be obtained under Title III of the

Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (which means obtaining

a court order and permission from the Attorney General).

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS

In the field of criminal investigations--and particularly

those dealing with the subject of organized crime--no investigative technique

is more valuable than that dealing with the use of confidential informants.

These sources, at the risk of their lives, furnish information

relating to law violations, the whereabouts of desperately wanted fugitives,

the structure and activities of organized criminal groups, the identities

of racket bosses and their spheres of influence, and the sources of hoodlum

funds. In most cases, the probable cause utilized in affidavits requesting

court-authorized electronic surveillances comes from confidential informants.

Bureau policy with respect to the development and control of

confidential informants is generally aimed at the need for exercising great

care and judgment in the selection, operation, and evaluation of these

sources.

Safeguards provide for a preliminary analysis of an individual's

potential for development, a probationary period of observation before he is

declared a full-fledged informant, continuing corroboration of his information

as compared with that furnished by other sources and investigations, regular

certifications as to his reliability and mental stability by the Agent handling

him, and the utilization of an alternate Agent to assist the primary Agent in

handling and evaluating the informant.

In addition to on-the-scene supervision provided by the office

operating him, each informant is also evaluated continually at FBI Head-

quarters based upon the payment requests and progress letters detailing his

accomplishments and by the inspection teams which visit each office annually.

Close supervision is also necessary to insure that the Bureau

never gets into a position where it can be accused, either rightly or wrongly,

of financing illicit operations, condoning criminal violations, entrapping

persons into committing offenses, or having its representatives serve as

agents provocateur.

In order to protect the lives of its informants, the FBI

closely restricts the number of persons having access to the files dealing

with these sources. For this reason, no authorization is sought from the

Department for the operation of individual informants.

MAIL COVERS

The FBI's "Manual of Rules and Regulations" (II-8-B-10)

states that requests for mail covers must be held to an absolute minimum,

being utilized only in important investigations and when it is anticipated

that informátion of value will be obtained. This technique does not

involve the opening of mail but merely the listing of external data on the

outside of the envelope, such as postmarks and return addresses.

Postal regulations stipulate that mail covers may be requested

in fugitive or criminal cases in order to locate fugitives or to obtain evidence

of a commission or attempted commission of a crime punishable by more than

a year in prison.

In recommending a mail cover in such a case, the field

has been instructed to notify FBI Headquarters that, unless advised to the

contrary within 10 days, it intends to request a mail cover from the Postal

Inspector in Charge of the local area. Such requests to the Postal Inspector

must be in writing and specify reasonable grounds for the need of a mail

cover, the statute and penalty involved, whether the subject has been indicted

and, it so, the identity of his attorney (providing he has one and the identity

is available). In fugitive cases, this same information must be supplied

regarding the fugitives as well as the person to be covered.

In fugitive and criminal cases, mail covers may be placed for

30 days' duration and subsequently renewed for additional 30-day periods,

up to a total of 120 days.

Special Agents in Charge of field offices are responsible for

regularly checking the productivity of mail covers being utilized by their

offices.

Departmental authority is not required for use of this investigative

technique.

ALL INFORIMATION CONTAINED

TRASH COVERS

Because the subjects of security, as well as criminal, cases

often dispose of highly incriminating material in garbage recepticals, the

recovery of this material by law enforcement agencies can be important

from both investigative and evidentiary standpoints.

On September 17, 1964--following a complaint in the press

by the American Civil Liberties Union--the Bureau sent a radiogram to

all offices instructing that the use of trash covers be discontinued immediately.

From then until 1971, with the exception of one security case approved by

Mr. Hoover in 1965, the FBI made no use of this investigative technique.

Then, on July 27, 1971, a letter was sent to the Attorney General requesting

general permission to use trash covers on a "selective and judicious" basis.

By return letter, dated September 3, 1971, Assistant Attorney General Will

Wilson, of the Criminal Division, replied that permission was granted to

utilize these covers on the basis requested. There is no notification of the

Department, however, regarding the operation of individual trash covers.

The major issue raised with respect to the use of this investiga-

tive technique hinges on the question of whether or not trash covers constitute

unreasonable search and seizure.

In 1963, the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari in

a Federal gambling case (involving Internal Revenue Service agents) on the

grounds that, by the time the agents had taken the defendant's trash containing

incriminating gambling documents, it had been abandoned by the defendant.

The taking of things abandoned was not deemed an unreasonable search and

seizure. General guidelines drawn from this case (U S. v. Minker, 312 F2d

632, cert. den., 83 S. Ct. 952) indicate that the trash in question must be

outside the defendant's house and yard before it can be held to have been

abandoned. In the case of a person living in a hotel or an apartment house,

the general rule of law is that his constitutionally protected area does not

extend beyond his room or apartment, although the safest course to follow

is to wait until the trash has left the building. If the trash is that of a

55107 DocId: 32989558 Page 21

123

---

## Page 22

company or organization which controls the entire building, it would not

be abandoned until it had moved into the hands of the public trash collector

or the private contract trash collector hired to haul it away.

Other principal decisions upholding the legality of trash

covers, if properly operated, are: Abelv. U. S., 362 U. s. 217 (1960);

U. S. V. Stroble, 431 F2d 1273 (1970); and U. S. v. Dzialak, 441 F2d 212

(1971).

It should be noted, however, that there is one discordant

note in the trash cover situation. In a series of three decisions, the

Supreme Court of California has outlawed the use of trash covers in

that state: People v. Edwards, 71 Cal. 2d 1906 (1969); People v. Bradley,

1 Cal. 3d 80 (1970); and People v. Judith Krivda and Roger T. Miner

decided July 12, 1971. The last case was a 4-3 decision which held that a

trash cover was illegal even when the officers had obtained the evidence

from the trash collectors without trespassing on the subjects' premises.

PEN REGISTERS AND

TOLL CALL RECORDS

By way of background, "pen register" is the generic title for

a set of instruments known as dial-pulse recorders (when employed in

connection with dial telephones) and touch-tone decoders (for use with

push-button telephones). Unlike electronic surveillance installations,

pen registers do not intercept conversations but merely record on a

printout tape the various numbers called by the telephone in question.

The connection between the telephone and the register is made either

through a cable near the subject's place of operation or at the telephone

company's central office. The printouts, in turn, are received on a machine

located either in the local FBI field office or at some other space under

Bureau contra. As investigative material, these tapes are invaluable in

leading from one organized crime contact to another; as evidentiary material,

they sometimes constitute part of the probable cause for obtaining Title I

coverage in certain cases.

Inasmuch as pen registers do not involve the interception of

communications, the Department of Justice has advised in its "Manual for

Conduct of Electronic Surveillance under Title IlI of Public Law 90-351"

that court authorization for use of the registers should be sought under

Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure rather than Title III.

A Rule 41 order is analogous to a search warrant and may be issued by

either a United States Magistrate or District Judge, whereas a Title III

order can only be issued by a District Judge. With respect to the probable

cause affidavits, those prepared in connection with a pen register request

are not reviewed by the Department or FBI Headquarters personnel,

unlike Title III affidavits which must be approved by the Attorney General

before being presented to the court. In both instances, however, the

affidavits are prepared after close consultation with the local United States

Attorney or appropriate Strike Force representative. For practical

purposes, it should be noted that, in a number of instances, the Federal

judge issuing a Title III court order authorizing the interception of com-

munications will also issue a separate Rule 41 order authorizing the

utilization of a pen register.

Achieving somewhat the same purpose as the pen register--

that is, helping identity the recipients of telephone calls from the subject

under investigation--is a review of toll calls maintained by the telephone

company. No Departmental approval is necessary for the use of this

technique, but the FBI's "Manual of Rules and Regulations" (II-8-B-1)

states that, 'Wherever possible, it is desirable that a subpoena be utilized. "

As a matter of fact, the American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T)

Company and its affiliated members have adopted regulations requiring

the production of a civil or criminal subpoena before making available toll

records and will notify a subscriber within 24 hours of the receipt of the

subpoena unless the Special Agent in Charge of the local FBI office certifies

that such notification could prejudice an investigation.

With respect to pen registers, it should be noted that some

telephone companies, such as the Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania,

have been ignoring Rule 41 orders for the production of printouts (except

in Title Ill cases) on the grounds that the company may incur liabilities

from which it is protected by the provisions of Title III.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

The purpose of the below is to set forth a brief

summary of actions carried out by the FBI to discredit and

neutralize King.

These actions include those taken in the

investigative file of King and those included in our

"COINTELPRO" files.

It is noted that in testimony before the Senate

Intelligence Committee on 11/19/75,

Mr. J. B. Adams of the FBI

stated there were approximately 25 incidents of actions taken.

against King and that Mr. Schwarz of the Senate Select Committee

(SSC) had those available.

It is believed that the actions

Mr. Adams referred to are included in the following:

A. Mailing of a tape and anonymous letter to King (note that

this incident was never established as an official FBI action)

A copy of the letter which may have been used in

mailing of the tape to King was discovered in the papers of

former Assistant to the Director W. C. Sullivan when he left

the Bureau. This letter was made available to the SSC and the

Department by FBI memorandum dated 9/18/75, in response to SSC

request dated 8/20/75, Part VII, Item 16c.

B. FBI plan to replace King with another black leader of our

choice

The only information available concerning this action

was a memorandum by w. C. Sullivan which was furnished the SSC

and Department by FBI

memorandum 10/16/75 in response to SSC

request dated 9/29/75, Item 19.

C. Proposals under our COINTELPRO (previously reviewed by Dept.)

D. Dissemination of information outside the Executive Branch

to discredit or neutralize King

E. Memoranda which specifically mention discrediting or

neutralizing King

By request of 10/15/75, the SSC desired all materials

and memoranda concerning FBI efforts to discredit or neutralize

King.

A review of King and related files was conducted to identify

memoranca which specifically used the terminology "discredit"

or I'neutralize."

Results were furnished to the SSC and the

Department by FBI memorandum dated 11/6/75. A summary of this

memorandum is as follows.

1. In June; 1966, Bureau authority was denied for

Atlanta to conduct background investigation regarding Zernona

Clayton, "Office. Hostess"

at SCLC Headquarters, Atlanta, with

view towards possible use of intormation developed to discredit

Martin Luther King, Jr:, and/or SCLC.

==

2. In December, 1965, Bureau received information

indicating King allegedly had a

numbered bank account in a

Nassau bank.

A bank officer in a position to have information

concerning this was approached with negative results. No further

attempt was made to develop information regarding a numbered

account.

..

Proposal in February, 1964, that letter be written

regarding King's new book which would incorporate all communist

influence upon him; for example,

the counsel which Stanley David

Levison gave relative to the book. No indication this was

accomplished.

F: The remaining instances regarding FBI efforts to discredit

or neutralize King, as outlined below,. were obtained through

a review of a work paper prepared in 1974 by former SA C. E.

Glass, These items were apparently not previously furnished

the SSC or Department.

===

1. On 1/15/64, an SA of the Atlanta Office telephoned

W. C. Sullivan and told him that Eugene Patterson, editor of the

"Atlanta Constitution" newspaper, was a close personal friend of.

the Agent. The Agent and Patterson had theorized about men of

questionable character in public life and Patterson had said

these people should me empere, mr me me agent to

mention was

made of King

, but the Agent thought that if the Bureau

would in the future want to use Patterson and his paper as a

friendly source it could do so securely.

Mr.. Sullivan told the

Agent that this type of thing should be handled out of Head-

quarters and the

Agent should take no action without being

advised.

There is no record that anything was ever done

result of this suggestion.

However,

5/21/73 quoted Eugene Patterson as recalling that an FBI Agent

attempted in the pring of 1964 to have Patterson expose King's

running around with women while posing as a moral leader.

According to the article, Patterson said he refused to engage in

this type of activity (serial 3949 and 100-3-116-784)•

TV show on King.

The results of this action are not

known (serial 455).

justify and substantiate his position in his efforts to maintain

responsible Government.

On 2/22/71, he was furnished a copy of

the Congressional Record of 5/16/68

containing derogatory infor-

mation regarding King and a copy of an article in "The Evening

'Star" dated 6/19/69 concerning the initiation of a wiretap on

King•

This was public source material but furnishing it to this

State. Representative was possibly outside the normal

scope of.

the Bureau's jurisdiction.

However, no nonpublic information

from our files was furnished to the State Representative nor was

information regarding King's personal conduct (serial 3904).

It is noted that in addition to the above,

a review

of King and related files revealed that in numerous instances

throughout our investigation of King, information was provided

local law enforcement agencies.

This action is not deemed as

efforts to discredit or neutralize King, but merely as part of

our responsibilities, since at that time, demonstrations resulting

in violence often occurred where King appeared.

In most instances,

these Local agencies had requested the FBI to furnish them advance

information regarding King's travel plans and itinerary.

It should also be pointed out that as a highly

controversial figure,. King was widely loved and hated.

letters were

received at FBIHQ, both from supporters and enemies

of King, asking for information to verify or disprove rumors and

reports

concerning him.

Many furnished information containing

allegations of communist influence on King. The only information

furnished by the FBI in response to these inquiries was verifica-

tion that Mr. Hoover did call King the most notorious liar in the

country because of his gross distortion of the facts concerning

our handing of civil rights investigations in

the South. We

refused to substantiate information about King's communist

connections.

He has not been previously identified publicly as an FBI

informant. Documents were delivered to SSC from which

Dorsett's identity could be deduced and the facts in the

news article are contained therein. Senator Robert Morgan

of North Carolina, member of the SSC, has referred to the

formation of the CKKKK as an FBI operation. Dorsett was

interviewed by Charlotte Agents 12/12/75 and expressed his

sense of betrayal upon having his identity disclosed. Dorsett

was assured his disclosure was not by the FBI which he

recognizes. It is being recommended that attached letter be

sent to the Attorney General pointing out this disclosure

and enclosing for the Attorney General's delivery to Senator

Frank Church, Chairman of the SSC enclosed IHM which requests

SSC to advise if they did, in fact, publicly disclose the

identity of former FBI informant George F. Dorsett as alleged and

Details:

By teletype 12/10/75 Charlotte Office advised that the

12/10/75 issue of the "Greensboro Daily News," Greensboro,

North Carolina, contained an article by Jack Betts captioned

"Greensboro Man Named as FBI Klan Informant." This article

states in part:

"Washington - A Greensboro man long active in the

Ku Klux Klan has been identified as an informant for the

Federal Bureau of Investigation's campaign to disrupt the

KKK in North Carolina during the latter 1960's.

"A Senate Intelligence Committee source said Tuesday

that George F. Dorsett, former Imperial Kludd (National Chaplain)

of the United Klans of America, was a paid FBI informant who,

with the FBI's assistance, broke away from the Klan in 1967 to

form a rival group.

The source said Dorsett was named in FBI documents

obtained by the committee as the man whom the bureau had recruited

to spy on the United Klan.

"FBI documents obtained by the committee indicate

that Dorsett, who was disenchanted with KKK Grand Dragon.

J. Robert Jones of Granite Quarry and with Imperial Wizard

Robert Shelton of Tuscaloosa, Ala., was encouraged by the FBI

to leave the Klan in the summer of 1967 and form the

Confederate Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. The FBI helped

Dorsett draft letters recruiting for the new group, according to

the committee source.

"According to the documents, the FBI's plan was to

harass the KKK and to dilute the influence of the United Klans

and to keep closer tabs on the new group.

"Sen. Robert Morgan, D. N.C., a member of the

committee said last week that charters for some 41 new Klaverns

or chapters of the Confederate Klan were issued, but that not

all charters resulted in active new Klan groups."

George F. Dorsett was an FBI Klan informant from

January, 1959, to October, 1970. He was discontinued as an

informant when his activity in the Klan ceased. His

relationship with the Bureau at the time of his being

terminated as an informant continued to be excellent at that

time.

He has not been disclosed publicly as an FBI informant.

Dorsett did in fact separate from the UKA and form the CKKKK.

He formed the CKKKK on his own initiative; however, we utilized

this opposing Klan organization through Dorsett as a means

of disrupting and causing confusion and dissension within the

Klan.

Re:

Activities (SSC)

62-116395

On 8/28/75 SSC Staff Member Barbara Banoff accepted

copies of 212 excised serials relating to White Hate matters

of the SSC COINTELPRO requests. Among the material provided

was a series of communications captioned "Counterintelligence

Program, Internal Security, Disruption of Hate Groups (United

Klans of America, Inc., North Carolina," dated from 5/9/67 to

9/13/67 and one communication with the same caption except

that it related to the Confederate Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,

and one captioned "Counterintelligence Program, Disruption of

Hate Groups, Internal Security, Racial Matters

(Klan)," dated

9/25/67.

157-9-8, Serials 100, 102, 107, 110, 115, 113, 114,

126, 127, 128, 151, 129)

These documents detail dissension within the UKA in

North Carolina in 1967. Dorsett who was the Imperial Kludd

(National Chaplain) for the UKA at that time, was directly

involved in the dissension.

He separated from the UKA and

formed the CKKKK. The handling agent assisted Dorsett in

preparing a letter announcing his resignation from the UKA

and his formation of the CKKKK. This letter invited Dorsett's

friends in the Klan to join him in the CKKKK. A total of

41 chapters of the CKKKK were chartered, however, all of them

did not become effective operating chapters.

The documents delivered to the SSC were excised to

delete Dorsett's name as an informant. Charlotte airtel dated

8/22/67 and C. D. Brennan memorandum to W. C. Sullivan dated

8/24/67 set forth the recommendation and approval for the

mailing of a letter from Dorsett to all Klan units in North

Carolina announcing his resignation from the UKA and the

formation of the CKKKK. Dorsett's name is deleted from these

documents; however, it is clear that the informant is preparing

the letter.

Charlotte airtel to the Director 9/13/67 refers

to the 8/22/67 Charlotte airtel and states that the referenced

airtel recommended Bureau approval for letter to be mailed over

Dorsett's identity can readily be established as the FBI

informant.

In the December 6, 1975, issue of the "Charlotte

Observer'' a daily Charlotte, North Carolina, morning

newspaper there is a front page article captioned "FBI Started

41 North Carolina Klan Units, Morgan Says." In this article,

North Carolina Senator Robert Morgan, member of the Select Senate

Intelligence Subcommittee, said Friday, the FBI organized

41 KKK units in North Carolina during the 1960's as part of its

campaign against the white supremacist group. Morgan was also

quoted as saying, "The vast majority of people in the Klan in

North Carolina were law-abiding citizens. They may have had

different political views, but the organization was legitimate.

There may have been some violence, but we're not even sure

about that now." Morgan is further quoted

as saying, "There

is nothing basically wrong with having an informer in any

organization but when these informers do more than just listen,

when they instigate trouble, that's wrong." Morgan also said

the FBI financed the operations of the Federally organized

Klaverns.

The same information attributed to Morgan as set forth

above, was also received by radio station WBT at Charlotte on

December 5, 1975, and story received widespread media coverage.

By teletype 12/12/75 Charlotte advised Dorsett was

interviewed by Charlotte Agents at which time he advised he

feels "betrayed" by his government in view of the public

disclosure in the news media of his identity as an FBI source.

In view of this disclosure he has experienced great consternation

among his close friends and also with his son who was previously

unaware of his relationship with the Bureau. He stated difficult

personal relationships have developed between friends and family

as a result of this disclosure.

He has received some phone calls

during one of which the caller stated, "Tell that pimp to get

his casket ready." He expressed his concern for his personal

safety and for his family as well, as well as concern for the

safety of his personal property.

Dorsett was assured that the Bureau was not

responsible for his identity being disclosed and he

acknowledged that he knew the Bureau would not do so.

stated that he feels what he did for the FBI was right and

that it constituted a service he could render to his country.

Attached hereto is a letter to the Attorney General

pointing out this disclosure and recommending that the Attorney

General have delivered personally to SSC Chairman Senator

Frank Church the LHM being enclosed with the letter to the

Attorney General which sets forth this incident and requests

the SSC to advise if they did, in fact, publicly disclose

the identity of former FBI informant George F. Dorsett as alleged

and if so, the basis for such disclosure.

Director Sec'y --

Purpose of this memorandum is to inform you that

captioned individual, who has repeatedly complained about his

activities as a former FBI informant, telephonically advised

our Atlanta Office on December 9, 1975, that he was filing a

brief before the "Church Committee" (U. S. Senate Select

Committee on Intelligence Activities). Rogers stated that

although he holds the FBI in high esteem, he still feels he

was treated improperly by the Bureau, and upon request of the

"Church Committee" a brief is being submitted providing details

lof his allegations against the Ibl.

Rogers was operated as a Klan informant (former

AT 1366-E) of our Atlanta Office from December, 1957, to

November, 1958, and was compensated for his services and expenses

In December, 1958, he testified at a State trial concerning

the bombing of a Jewish Temple in Atlanta, and provided

significant evidence. During the trial Rogers was vigorously

cross-examined and even accused by the defense attorneys of

having participated in the bombing. Since the trial, Rogers

lappears to have developed a persecution complex, directing

letters of complaint to our Atlanta Office and FBI Headquarters,

Basically, he believes that we should publicly. acknowledge

that he was an undercover agent rather than an informant for

the FBI. He alleged being classified as an informant, placed

a stigma on him, and as a result he was held up to rigaguleri

and persecution

by the community.

3

Rogers' complaint has been discussed with him on

numerous occasions, and our position

has been clearly outiined.

Memorandum to Mr. J. G. Deegan

Re: Leslay E. Rogers

Former Extremist Informant

Rogers wrote to our Atlanta Office in February, 1973,

requesting that the FBI publicly' acknowledge him as an

undercover agent. He was subsequently interviewed by Agents

of the Atlanta Office and was informed his family would be

made aware of his valuable service performed in the past for

the FBI, but Rogers did not indicate he desired this be done.

Rogers said he was not being harassed or intimidated at that

time in connection with his testimony at the aforementioned

State trial, and indicated he wanted a statement from the FBI

concerning his activities for his own personal satisfaction.

In a letter dated March, 1, 1973, Rogers requested a

three man board of arbitration. to consider his complaint.

In-

asmuch as the Bureau's position in this matter had been made

quite clear to Roger's, the Atlanta Office did not acknowledge

receipt of Rogers' letter, and Headquarters concurred with the

Ros Roses, the

action taken.

We advised the Atlanta Office by airtel dated

March 14, 1973, that in the event Rogers contacts them again,

he should be courtenusly inforned of our position which has

been fully explained to him, and we consider the matter closed.

On the evening of December 9, 1975, Rogers telephonically

contacted our Atlanta Office and ad ised he was filing a brief

before the "Church Committee" (U. S. Senate Select Committee on

Intelligence Activities).

Rogers stated that while he holds the

FBI in high esteem, he still feels he was treated improperly

by the Bureau following his testimony at the State trial. Rogers

stated he recently telephonically contacted the "Church Committee"

regarding his complaint, and the Committee requested that he

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED

DATE 111,00 BY SPLALMK

On the morning of November 19; 1975, we were advised by

John Elliff, of the Senate Select Committee staff, that the Committee

desired to have the Director appear with the Attorney General on

December 8th or 9th to discuss the future of the FBI. This request

was referred to Mr. Adams who subsequently advised that Mr. Kelley

would be available for testimony on December 9th. He said that the

Director requested a briefing concerning such testimony on December 8th.

The Attorney General is out of the city today, however, we are

discussing this request with Douglas Marvin his Assistant in order to

determine the acceptability of December 9th for the Attorney General's

appearance with the Director. John Elliff will be advised when it can

be confirmed that the date is acceptable to the Attorney General.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. That Legal Counsel Division determine from John Elliff and

others of the Senate Select Committee as precisely as possible the

subject matter of the hearing and the general questions that will likely

be asked by the members and provide such information for the development

of briefing materials.

In accordance with the telephonic arrangements made by Mr.

BeLmOnt, LIaISOn Agent Bernard "ells, supervisor HiLliam AtkInson oI

the Washington Field Office, and I interviewed Mr. Arthur, Sylvester,

Assistant Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs) at the pentagon on

the evening of 6-27-61 concerning captioned matter. Mr. Sylvester

advised that the Department of Defense had first learned of the leak

when Fred Hoffman of the Associated Press called to inquire Concern~

(president vas deeply disturbed

ing the article. Subsequently, Pierre Salinger called, said the

and asked that this be looked into.

Mr. Sylvester was unable to furnish any information to pin-

point the leak, but stated from an analysis prepared by the Joint

Chiefs of Staff (JCS) it appeared that at least portions of the News

Week article had been obtained tron ICS documents dated 6-21 and 6-26.

Mr. Sylvester advised that he understood there was also a document

dated 6-24 which might be involved.

He said he was not familiar with

the documents and that details concerning their contents and distri

bution should be obtained from JCS.

Mr. Sylvester advised he did not know who obtained the in-

formation utilized in News Week or who wrote the story for news leek

but stated that Mr. Lloyd H. /Norman, 5420 Sist Street, N. "•,

Washington, D. Co, (telephone EM 3-6268) is the only News Week re-

porter covering the Pentagon and Mr. Sylvester assumes that Norman

least assisted

in preparing the story.

possibility that News Week reporters covering the White House and the

Department of State might have obtained bits of information and by

piecing their information together with information obtained by Norman

could have come up with this story.

He said he had no factual intor-

mation as to who leaked the information or that Norman was actually

the person who obtained the information.

LEAK OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION

7-3-61 "NEWS WEEK"

Subsequent to our discussion with Mr. Sylvester, General

L..

Le.

Lemnitzer, Chairman JCS, was interviewed on the evening oi

6-28 and again on the morning oi 6-48.

General Lemnitzer was unwilling

to definitely conclude that the News Week article came from recent

ICS papers and stated that similar planning has occurred in previous

crises, including the Berlin crisis in November, 1958, when the Soviets

threatened our position in Berlin.

He said, however, that there were

(certain points in the News Week article which appeared closely re-

lated to recent JCS documents and be would want to give turther study

to the article and documents before making any conclusion.

General Lemnitzer on the morning of 6-28 made available It.

General E. G. Wheeler, Director of the Joint Staff, and Rear Admiral

F. J. Blouin, Secretary, JCS.

Both General Wheeler and Admiral

Blouin indicated the belief that the News Week article had to have

been obtained at least in part from recent JCS documents and both

disclaimed any knowledge as to the possible source of the leak.

A subsequent review of various related documents indicates

quite probably that the News Week article was obtained from a JCS

memorandum dated 6-21-61. A brief history of this memorandum is as

follows:

On 6-14-61, Mr. Dean\Acheson, Special Advisor to the Presi-

dent, met with JCS and indicated that in his view the credibility

of the U. S. nuclear deterrent is no longer sufficient for restrain- -

ing the Soviets as Premier Khrushchev and some U. S. allies in Europe

doubt the U.S. would be willing to use nuclear weapons in the event

of a crisis over Berlin. Accordingly a study was undertaken to de-

termine what action should be taken in order to preclude the develop-

a rot to preto to

ment of such a crisis, which study was to include the urgent need to

re-establish the credibility of the U.S. nuclear deterrent.

On 6-21 JCS met and recommended certain immediate political

decisions be made in order that actions could be initiated to con-

vince the Soviets of the U.S. determination to maintain its own

rights and those of its allies. JCS recommended in view of the

urgency of the current situation and in order to preclude the de-

velopment of a Berlin crisis that after the necessary political de-

cisions have been made, certain preparatory military measures be

implemented.

JCS recommended to the Secretary of Defense by memo-

randum of 6-21 that the Secretary of Defense and JCS discuss this

with the President at the earliest opportunity.

Attached to the

JCS memorandum to the Secretary of Defense on

6-21 were two ap-

pendices - a (on political matters) and b (on military requirements).

This memorandum of 6-21 with the two appendices contains all of the

information needed for someone to write the News Week article al-

though certain wording is obviously changed and certain information,

such as the number of U. S. dependents and the number of U.s. troops

to be used as reinforcements have apparently been obtained elsewhere.

From an analysis of the article and an analysis of the 6-21 memo-

randum, it appears to us that someone had access to the information

and thereafter wrote the News Week article.

In this connection (and this was noted by General Lemnitzer)

there is additional startling information in the 6-21 JCS paper which

does not appear in the News Week article and this might indicate that

whoever furnished the information to the News Week representative

deliberately furnished only certain information.

An example of

startling information not included in News Week is the fact that the

6-21 paper recommended that the U.S. resume U-2 reconnaissance flights

INTERVIEWS CURRENTLY BEING CONDUCTED

We have completed or are completing early this afternoon inter-

views with JCS representatives familiar with the documents prepared

and the dissemination of these documents. We

will also have completed

the review of the documents to determine those possibly involved

l in

this leak. We will also have determined today the identities of

recipients of the documents and be prepared to start with detailed

interviews of those receiving the pertinent document of 6-21 to de-

termine who had access to it and whether the recipients have disclosed

the infornation to anyone or have any possible information as to the

News Week story. In this connection it is known that the document

was furnished to such prominent people as the Secretary of Defense,

Dean Acheson, Special Advisor to the President, Admiral Arleigh Burke,

and the very top military men.

We plan on interviewing all of the

people who received this document, but will not interview anyone at

the White House or Mr. Dear Acheson until this is specitically ce

General Lemnitzer and all concerned have stressed the ex-

"Top Secret". General Lemnitzer has beencompletely cooperatiye,

but has indicated he does not desire to furnish any documents to

be taken from JCS. In this connection I believe it is necessary for

us to have copies of the actual JCS memorandum dated 6-21 for us to

This is being given top priority and you

On June. 29, 1961, a confidential informant, who

as furnished reliable intormation in

the past, Learned

that Dorothy Norman, wifelor Iloyd id Norman, Correspondent

for "Newsweek" magazine, with residence at 5420 jist Street,

N. W., Washington, D. C., had advised an unidentified

woman that at about 6:30 p.m. that evening Federal Bureau

of Investigation (FBI) Agents were at her

nome to talk to

her husband about an article that Lloyd Norman had written

and were trying to discover his source of the information.

On this same date, this informant also learned

from Mrs. Norman that the FBI Agents were at her residence

concerning Lloyd Norman's story on Berlin. Mrs. Norman

did not know what was going to happen, but she hoped they

would not start an investigation and the Normans would not

have to postpone their trip.

AKALARRY

This informant also-learned on June 29, 1961,

that Lloyd Norman was in contact with Larry (possibly

Lawrence He Burd, Washington Correspondent, Chicago Tribune

Press Service) of the "Chicago Tribune." According to the

informant, Norman advised Larry that he had just had a

visit from

the FBI. The informant stated that this did not

surprise Larry.

The informant stated that Larry advised Norman

that "we" got a call back and the "Sun Times" has written

a story on this "thing.". According to Larry, the magazine

"Newsweek" was not mentioned by name, but was referred to

as a national publication.

According to the informant, Larry advised Norman

that apparently Norman's story has "them" upset. Norman

did not know what they were worried about, but guessed

that they were upset about it and added that unfortunately

he had nothing he could say. The informant stated that

Norman continued that they (FBI) are trying to find out

where he got the story, and he was trying to explain that

no one gave it to him on a platter, by which he meant it

did not come from one source.

Norman continued that they

are going to have to get educated in the techniques of the

newspaper business, whereby you develop surmises and

deductions, pick up a few ideas, put it together, and then

you say that this is what these

people must be working on.

The informant also learned that Norman was to see the Agents

again during the morning of June 30, 1961, and that he is

trying to take a trip this week, leaving Saturday, July 1,

1961, in the early morning.

"The informant stated that larry advised Norman

that lor Ross (phonetic) (possibly Thomas B. Ross, Washington

Correspondent, Chicago "Sun Times") talks about the White

House being ready to press criminal prosecution. The

informant stated that it was Norman's opinion that Salinger

(possibly Pierre Salinger, Presidential Press Secretary)

knows about that, and he (Salinger) said that there is an '

investigation under way, but did not say much else.

The informant learned that it is Norman's belief

that they are wasting their time and that to his knowledge

it was not a secret at the time, and people were writing about

the Berlin crisis.

Norman just

happened to put the right

things together, unfortunately.

The informant further lgärned on June 29, 1961,

that Norman had contacted a Mrs. Bradlee in an attempt to

locate Ben (possibly Benjamin C Bradlee, Chief, Washington

Norman advised Mrs. Bradlee that Ben should be told

that the FBI has made their visit to Norman, and they

are going to be talking to him tomorrow.

The informant

stated that Mrs. Bradlee asked if "he" is going to carry

out this idle threat.

It was Norman's opinion that "they" are crazy,

and he stated he has lost his faith in the New Frontier.

The informant learned from Mrs. Bradlee that

"he" is terribly upset about it. Norman advised her that

she" should be told that Norman discussed the normal

routine of working the story through the office and that

there is nothing he has to or wants to conceal except

the identity of the sources.

Norman does not believe

"they" have any reason to believe any secret material was

given away.

The informant stated that Norman planned to

talk to Ben during the morning of June 30, 1961, and

has an appointment to see "them" (FBI) at 9 o'clock in

the morning to continue their conversation.

The informant stated that Norman advised

Mrs. Bradlee that he would be home for about ten minutes,

as he was just changing clothes, and inquired as to the

advisability of attempting to contact Ben. at the office.

The informant stated that Mrs. Bradlee suggested that

he try this.

Subsequently, on June 29, 1961, the informant stated

he learned Ben Bradlee discussed with Lloyd Norman the interview

Norman had with FBI Agents earlier on June 29, 1961. Bradlee

asked Norman what did you do, get "us" in trouble. Norman

laughed and commented that the FBI would probably be questioning

Bradlee also, as they had his name and they obviously knew a

great deal.

Norman said he told the FBI Agents Bradlee knew

Bob Kennedy and President Kennedy; that whatever information he

had was already available to them and "we" knew a good deal

about this case already.

Informant said that in the discussion which ensued,

Norman told Bradlee what the FBI had asked him. Norman said

he had been asked how Norman knew that the Joint Chiefs of

Staff were doing this and that.

and th to

Norman stated he tried to

explain the business of journalism; how reporters anticipate

and

assume or conclude by adding two and two together what

action might be taken.

Norman said he told the FBI he did not

know what the Joint Chiefs of Staff were doing,

since he did

not sit in on their meetings. He said he made it clear to

the FBI Agents "we" did not need an official confirmation to

assume that the Joint Chiefs of Staff were doing certain things.

Informant advised Norman told Bradlee the FBI Agents

asked him

if anyone had confirmed the information in his article.

Norman said he told them no, however, "Newsweek" felt it was

an accurate story.

Norman said he also told the FBI he

understood no such "reports" (not further identified) were in

existence when Norman wrote the article, which fact Norman

just discovered on June 20, 1961.

According to the informant, Norman told Bradlee he

agreed with the FBI that if there was a leak of information

harmful to national security, efforts should be made to plug.

the leak. Norman said he told the FBI he did not feel the

information in his article was classified information, even at

this time. Further, he felt that this article was beneficial

to the national security and believed there was no reason why

it should not be discussed. Norman indicated to the FBI he

was not a judge of security, but had a pretty good idea what

was security information, since he had been in the reporting

business for a long time.

Informant said Norman told Bradlee he advised the

FBI Agents he would not cooperate with the FBI by naming or

giving a list of the individuals he contacted at the Pentagon;

that it was an unwritten rule about revealing sources; that it

would be unfair to the persons involved and that he did not

feel anyone was guilty of a violation in this matter. Norman

said he did want to cooperate to any normal extent, but did

not want to devote a lot of time to it.

-

According to the informant, Norman told Bradlee the

FBI Agents had advised him he had a right to counsel and so

forth, and that anything he said could be held against him.

He said he had been interviewed for about one hour.

This informant advised Norman told Bradlee he had

an appointment with the FBI Agents at the District Headquarters

of the FBI at 9 a.m., June 30, 1961, and intended to keep

this appointment. Informant said Bradlee and Norman discussed

the advisability of an attorney accompanying Norman to the

interview on June 30, 1961, but Norman decided against it.

Bradlee told Norman he should talk an absolute minimum and

confine the conversation to the esoterics of the journalistic

profession. Norman indicated to Bradlee he would spend a little

time with the FBI on June 30, 1961, but did not want to waste

time since he had other things to do.

According to the informant, Bradlee told Norman he

felt Norman had talked enough already. Bradlee also commented

"they probably have you bugged" and want Norman to sign a

statement or something like that. Bradlee commented later in

this discussion he thought Norman could assume his telephone

was "tapped." Norman stated he hoped it was, as he had nothing

to conceal.

Informant advised Norman stated he felt badly about

this situation because it involved a lot of innocent people

and wasted time. Bradlee asked Norman if he had not been

referred to Bureau's investigation in captioned case and fact

that a telephone tap was installed by Bureau on Washington

residence of Lloyd H. Norman, a reporter for "Newsweek" magazine.

The Director requested more details pertaining to this matter.

USE OF WIRETAP

Nornan wrote an article in the 7-3-61 issue of

"Newsweek" which disclosed "Top Secret" information and our file

in that case contains a memorandum from A. A. Belmont to the

Director, of 6-28-61, in which Mr. Belmont pointed out that

a technical surveillance had been placed on Norman's residence

as oi 10:45 P.M., 6-27-61.

The Director, on 6-28-61, advised

the then Attorney Genera1

Robert F. Kennedy that we had put a

wiretap on Norman's telephone without consulting the Attorney

General. Kennedy advised that he thought it best to keep the

wiretap on Norman, and when the Director told him we intended

to interview Norman, Kennedy thought we might say something to

him to make him institute a call.

By letter, 6-29-61, 10

Kennedy, we confirmed the installation of the wiretap on

Norman's residence.

The original of this letter, which bears

Kennedy's signature approving the wiretap, dated 6-30-61, is

a pari of our files.

This technical surveillance was discontinued

at 6:00 P.M. on 7-3-G1. We did not obtain information from this

wiretap which assisted

person responsible for leaking the ciassified information to

MICMORANDUM DATED JULY 6, 1961

MICFOPHONE AND TECHNICAL SURVEILLANCES

RESUME OF INVESTIGATION

On 6-27-61, the then Attorney General Robert F.

Kennedy called the Director to advise that there had appeared in

the 7-3-61 issue of "Newsveek" an article pertaining to our

militasy plans in Germany. Kennedy stated the President had

called him to see if it would be possible to find out who was

responsible for this leak.

Investigation showed that the

"Nowsweek" article contained information from a "Top Secret"

document prepared by the Joint Chiefs of Staff dated 6-21-61,

which contained proposals to be discussed with the President,

which, it adopted, would result in the United States assuming

a general war posture.

The disclosure of this information

undoubtedly would cause a great deal of consternation not only

in the Uniced States but throughout the world.

We completed our investigation on 7-5-61 and

furnished the Attorney General on 7-6-61 a 361-page memorandum

incorporating results of 253 interviews, incLuding individuals

at coint chiers of start, and the Departments of the Army, Navy,

Air Force, and Defense, as well as Lloyd Il. Norman, the "Newsweek"

reporter who wrote the

article.

Norman claimed he based his article on speculation

and conjecture and he refused to name his contacts. The

majority of those interviewed thought a competent, well- informed

reporter familiar with military affairs could have written the

article without having reviewed or received classified data.

ur investigation did not pinpoint the source of the leak and

s in the usual leak case involving a reporter, ve found tha

Norman had almost unlimited contacts in government.

ACTION:

For the Director's information.

HERE 1/0 5 5 AUMP

In talking with the Attorney General on April 15, 1961, I

mentioned to him the extensive investigation which had been conducted

by the Bureau in line with the Attorney General's request in connection

with Dominican Lobbying Activities, particularly with relation to the

intensified coverage during the time preceding the passage of the sugar

quota law:

The Attorney General stated that he had had this subject

in mind and had intended to mention it earlier in the week. It was his

feeling that the investigation conducted by the Bureau had been most

worthwhile and had been of particular value to the State Department in

connection with State Department discussions with Dominican representatives.

The Attorney General stated that now the law was passed he did not feel

there was justification for continuing this extensive investigation. The

Attorney General said he knew the technical coverage which had been

instituted was time-cortsuming and expensive. It was pointed out to him

that we still have and will continue to have regular coverage of the

Dominican consulates in Washington and New York in addition to our

live informant coverage in this field. The Attorney General said he

thought this would be most satisfactory; that we could discontinue the

additional intensive activities. He was informed that we would, of

course, advise him of any pertinent information developed through our

regular coverage.

This memorandum is prepared to briefly set

concerning our lyo Dominican sugar lobbying Investigation and

the extent Congressman (Harold D. Cooley (Democrat - North Caroling

This investigation was initiated 2/9/61 at specific

request of then Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to develop

intelligence data which would enable him to provide President

Kennedy a picture of what was behind pressures exerted on behalf

¡of Dominicans regarding sugar quota deliberations in Congress.

This was in connection with pending sugar legislation. It is

noted the Dominican Republic, under the rule of infamous dictator

Generalissimo Trujillo at the time, was in the throes of an

economic crisis and Trujillo intensely desired the passage of a

sugar bill by U. S. Congress which would contain quotas favorable

On the other hand, the Kennedy

Administration desired a bill which would give the Executive

Branch necessary flexibility in establishing country quotas,

ostensibly for purpose of denying quotas to countries (such as

Dominican Republic under Trujillo) whose foreign policy was at.

odds with ours.

Our intensive investigation (which at peak consisted of

twelve telephone surveillances, three microphone surveillances,

and physical surveillances on eleven different individuals)

produced voluminous data showing extensive activities by Dominican

officials and their agents to secure favorable sugar legislation.

Coverage revealed Dominicans to have entree to offices of various

senators and congressmen (including (Cooley) and Agriculture

Department officials.

It was also determined that they had sources

of information in such hey spots as house committee on Agriculture,

24/15/61 the Attorney General advised that our investigation had

However, we developed no

FRANK CAPELL

ESPIONAGE - X

Capell, editor of extremist anticommunist newsletter "The

Herald of Freedom," is involved in three instances of what may be

unauthorized possession of classified information. He has printed

of this data which is similar to information which originated with

Bureau in his newsletter, and plans to include other classified informa-

tion in a book now at the publishers. The published information

pertains

to derogatory data regarding certain State Department employees

who were investigated by us under the loyalty program.

The other

information identifies a Soviet official as a KGB agent. It appears

his sourceris at State, since that agency is the only one which has all

the classifieddata involved. Capell has refused to furnish identity of

his source whose action, plus Capell's practice of printing the data,

constitutes a danger to

the security of the United States.

-та.

We should try to eliminate this security threat and dry up his

source.

We have asked State Department to conduct administrative inquiry

to see if the source is a State Department employee. The best way for

us to resoive the identity of Capell's source is through a technical

surveillance. Newark on 4/15/65 advised full security assured for

technical surveillances (tesurs) on subject's residence and place of

business. At present we have 56 investigative-type tesurs in operation

with four pending. The limit is 75.

This memorandum recommends that we close our investigation of •

¡Capell, Including discontinuance of technical surveillances on Capell and

la close associate of the subject, Robert Manuel.

Subject is anticommunist extremist who publishes weekly newsletter

and has written various books attacking alleged security risks in U.S.

Government. He has in past published classified data, some originating

with Bureau, and our investigation has been aimed at identifying his sources

in the Government. With the Attorney General's approval, we instituted

technical coverage of Capell's residence in Zarephath, New Jersey, on

5/11/65 and also on residence and office of Manuel, Fairfax, Virginia,

Lattorney, on 6/25/65.

"We have not developed any data since outset of investigation which

would show that Capell or Manuel are currently receiving information from

individuals in the Executive Branch of the Government. In fact, we now

believe that it is highly unlikely that our technical coverage will develop

such information in the future.

We have received a volume of information regarding day-to-day

contacts of Capell and Manuel, including identities of various sources and

associates of their's in the news field, among clergymen, in the Legislative

Branch, in the ranks of other right-wing extremist groups and among various

local law enforcement agencies. On occasion, our coverage has provided

information of some interest with regard to the efforts of Capell and his

associates to smear or discredit high-ranking Government officials, such as

Supreme Court Justices Goldberg and

fortas, various liberal Senators,

• In addition, our coverage has occasionally provided information

which has been of personal interest to the President,

such as data regarding

an unfavorable book being written.

We have furnished information of this

instance involved advising Chief of Police John Layton of the Metropolitan

Police Department, Washington, D. C., on a confidential basis of the

improper activities of two local police officers in supplying Manuel and

Capell with confidential data from police morals records.

Despite the occasional information of value our technical

coverage has developed, the fact remains that these sources have not and

evidently will not assist in resolving our primary objective; namely,

identification of any person in the Executive Branch of the Government

testine out

who might be leaking classified data. As a matter of fact, our coverage

of Capell and Manuel has failed to indicate that they have been receiving

classified information from sources in the Executive Branch.

Under the circumstances, it is believed we can no longer justify

the continuance of technical coverage on Manuel and Capell and it is felt we

should discontinue our investigation. However, we feel that at this time we

should on a confidential basis alert the New York State Police with regard

to the activities of a lieutenant in that Department who has also been

cooperating with Capell and Manuel and who has been apparently furnishing

them information obtained during the course of his official duties; namely,

Lieutenant William Lovelock. In this regard it is noted that the super-

intendent of the New York State Police is the former Special Agent in Charge

Arthur Cornelius and he could be furnished the information relating to

Lovelock through contact by the Special Agent in Charge of our Albany Office.

HH 55107 • DocId: 32989558

Ihe Committee has asked me to talk with you

today about the future of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

I thought

Áe might be helpful if I outline quite briefly

some of

the points I would like to make, some of the

problems I

think ought to be considered, and some of the

steps we have taken.

The first point is that the statutory base

for the operations of the Bureau cannot be said to be fully

satisfactory. The basic statutory provision is 28 USCA

533 which provides that the Attorney General may appoint

officials"(]) to detect and prosecute crimes against the

United States; (2) to assist in the protection of the

President; and (3) to conduct such investigations regarding

official matters under the control of the Department of

Justice and the Department of State as may be directed by

the Attorney General."

There are other statutes, such

as the Congressional Assassination, Kidnapping and Assault

Act, which vest in the Bureau special responsibilities to

investigate criminal violations. In addition, there are

Executive orders and Presidential statements or directives

which place investigatory responsibilities upon the Bureau.

A number of questions are often asked about this

statutory base.

It has the virtue of simplicity, but the

Executive orders which deal with government employee

investigations are complicated and confusing, and Presidential

Page 87

- 2.

memoranda, or, perhaps, oral instructions from a President,

may be difficult to collate. I think it is important,

in any case, to separate out the kinds of questions which

are

asked

about the Bureau's authority base. Some questions

are constitutional in nature, relating to the inherent power

of the President; others go to the interpretation of the

statutes and the relationship between the statutes and

Presidential directives; others go to the failure of the

statutes to define sufficiently the areas of the Bureau's

jurisdiction or to spell out sufficiently--and this is

partly constitutional--the means and methods which the Bureau

is permitted to use in carrying out its assigned tasks.

The second point, related to the first, is a

continuing discussion of the role of the Bureau in intelligence

investigations or domestic security investigations. The

argument is sometimes made that the Bureau's proper role,

at least in purely domestic matters, should be limited to

investigations of committed crimes. The basic statute for

the Bureau is broader than this, as have been Executive

orders and Presidential mandates to the Bureau. The basic

statute is broader, since it refers to investigations

regarding official matters under the control of the Department

of Justice and the Department of State as may be directed

by the Attorney General. A disparity is sometimes seen

among the different roles of the Bureau in crime detection,

in on-going domestic security matters, and in foreign

intelligence or foreign counterintelligence matters. In

recent days a statement by the then Attorney General Harlan

Fiske Stone, who established the Bureau and chose J. Edgar

Hoover as its director, has been quoted

as a relevant

warning.

Stone warned. "There is always the possibility

that a secret police may become a menace to free government

and free institutions, because it carries with it the

possibility of abuses of power which are not always quickly

apprehended or understood .... It is important that its

activities be strictly limited to the performance of those

functions

for which it was created and that its agents

themselves be not above the law or beyond its reach ....

The Bureau of Investigation is not concerned with

political

or other opinions of individuals. It is concerned only

with their conduct and then only with such conduct as is

forbidden by the laws of the United States. When a police

system passes beyond these limits, it is dangerous to the

proper administration of justice and to human liberty, which

it should be our first concern to cherish."

I should like to suggest that Stone's warning always

must be considered relevant to the proper conduct of the

Bureau's duties, but it does not necessarily follow that

domestic security investigations are, therefore, outside

the Bureau's proper functions. The detection of crime in .

some areas requires preparation and at least some knowledge

of what is likely to be going on. What is at issue, I think,

NH 55107 DocId:32989558 Page 89

---

## Page 90

-4 -

is the proper scope, the means and methods used, the attention

paid to conduct and not views, and the closeness of the .

relationship of the conduct and that which is forbidden by

the laws of the United States.

Third, I realize that some proposals, since I

was asked about this when I last appeared before this

Comnittee, might separate out in some fashion domestic and

foreign intelligence functions from the FEI or from one

another within the FBI. This is, of course, an issue to

be looked at. I assume it is recognized that there may

be some relationship between that intelligence which is

domestic and that intelligence which is involved in foreign

counterintelligence work. One may lead to the other.

And there may be a relationship between foreign counter-

intelligence and foreign intelligence. If the work were

separated out into different agencies, I do not know if

the decision about when an investigation should pass

from one agency to another always could be made easily.

Moreover, even so, information presumably would pass from

one agency to the other. I know that one consideration

has

been that it might be decided that information collected

by some permitted

means in intelligence investigations

under some circumstances should not be used in criminal

prosecutions. But if there is an exchange of information,

this must always be a consideration, whether there are

separate agencies

or not, and the basic question then is one

HW 55107 DooId: 32989558

Page 90

---

## Page 91

- 5 -

Of use and not organization. The more active concern,

I believe, is that there is a risk that conduct proper for

one area may be improper for another, and that the combination

can work a contamination. My view on this is that in any

case we must decide what conduct is appropriate and is

inappropriate

for each of the areas, and we must take

steps to make sure that conduct is lived up to. My hope

is that the fact that the FBI has criminal investigative

responsibilities, which must be conducted within the confines

of constitutional protections. strictly enforced by the courts,

gives the organization an awareness of the interests of

individual liberties that might be missing in an agency

devoted solely to intelligence work. I know the argument

can be run the other way. I believe the dangers

are greater

if there is separation.

NH 55107 DocId: 32989558 Page 91

## Page 92

Fourth, there is a question as to the proper role of

the FBI in crime prevention and whether or not it should be

considered authorized to take steps under some circumstances

to reduce

the likelihood that crimes will be committed

or that serious injury to persons or property will occur.

Preventive action has raised serious questions and these

must be dealt with. But I suppose an initial question is

whether it should be allowed at all. Yet I beliéve under

special circumstances and with proper controls most would

believe this to be a proper function.

Fifth, the problem of proper controls, supervision and

accountability is all-embracing. By statute the Federal

Bureau of Investigation is in the Department of Justice,

and also by statute the Attorney General is the head of the

Department of Justice. The history is mixed, of course, and .

we all have a tendency to over simplify, but it is à faix

statement that there have been times in the past when the

supervision by Attorneys General, granted that the Bureau must

have considerable autonomy, has been sporadic, practically

nonexistent, or ineffective. I hope that is not the case now.

The responsibility is a heavy one. But in any event the probt

lem of proper controls, supervision and accountability goes

beyond the Director of the Bureau and the Attorney General.

I have already mentioned that in my view the statutory base for

the operations of the Bureau cannot be said to be fully satis-

factory. I think that better controls and performance can

be achieved through statutory means, executive orders, guide-

lines, and reporting to appropriate congressional committees.

sixth, before

come to a resume of some

the steps •

which have been taken, let me say I know we all realize that

• in the past there have been grave abuses. I am uncomfortable

with a kind of writing of history, however, which sees it only

in terms of the abuses and not in terms of past and present •

strength. It is very difficult to be fair to the past in which

many institutions of government carried a share of responsibility.

But more than unfairness is involved. If we are not careful,

we will turn to solutions of the moment which a better reading

of history might indicate are not the best solutions. I know

we must seize the moment if I may use such a phrase in this

setting. I know also that this Committee realizes that a very

important agency with dedicated, highly professional, greatly

• disciplined government servants is involved. The importance

is to the security and domestic tranquility of the United States.

Stone's warning was given in an act of creation. He was proud

• of his creation. In spite of the abuses, there is a proper

place for pride. I take it our mutual work should be to nurture

that pride and the conditions which justify it.

I turn now to a review of some of the steps which have been

• taken or are in progress. We have tried most diligently, under

safeguards to protect the privacy of individuals and with an

awareness

of the unfairness of instant history to give a

great deal of information to Congressional committees. Attorney

General Saxbe, Deputy Attorney General Silberman, and Director

Kelley testified about the so-called COINTELPRO. When the FBI

discovered evidence of several more COINTELPRO projects after I

HH 55107 DocId:32989558 Page 93

---

## Page 94

became Attorney General, these were revealed.

One of my first

acts as Attorney General, my third week in office, was to testify

before a Congressional committee about possible incidents of

political misuse of the FBI by the White House in the past

• and about the nature of FBI file-keeping systems, particularly

•the files kept by Director Hoover in his office suite. Director

Kelley has spoken publicly and before congressional committees

about incidents in the past in which FBI agents engages in

break-ins to gather or photograph pyhsical evidence in intelli-

gence investigations. On a number of occasions, most recently in

testimony before this Committee, I have described the history

of the use of electronic surveillance by the FBI. We have

welcomed such opportunities.

On February 26, 1975, I directed Director Kelley to

• report to me any requests made of the Bureau or practices within

the Bureau which he deems improper or which present the appear-

ance of impropriety. On February 28, 1975, Director Kelley

ordered FBI personnel to report such requests or practices to

•him. In July 1975 I reaffirmed my February directive and also

asked for a report of all sensitive investigative practices.

Dixectory Kelley has regularly provided information on conduct

by Bureau agents and programs underway within the Bureau that

could raise questions. These matters have been reviewed and

discussed within the Department so that a consistent and approp-

riate policy can be achieved. This is a continuing process.

I do not assert that we are aware of everything about the Bureau.

Nor do I suggest that we ought to know everything. Appropriate

НН 55107 DocId:32989558 Page 94

## Page 95

communication, consultation and supervision at this level

have to be selective. I make this point, which I think may

sound disconcerting, not in any way to minimize the respon-

sibility of the Bureau to keep the Department informed nor

to minimize the Department's duty to find out. Rather

I want to be realistic about a learning and organization

problem which requires realism if it is to be understood

and perfected.

With respect to possible legislation, the Department

has in preparation various drafts of possible bills which may

be of assistance in the area of what is now warrentless

electronic surveillance. Although obtaining a judicial warrant

does not automatically eradicate the possibility of abuse,

it is perceived to be an important safeguard of individual

privacy interests, and we are exploring, as we said we would

do, various possibilities and alternatives.

Finally, a committee within the Department of Justice-:

chaired by Mary Lawton, Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the

Office of Legal Counsel and composed of representatives of my

office (Jack Fuller), the Criminal and Civil Rights Division

(Phil White, Walter Barnett), the Office of Policy and Planning

• (Alan Kornblum) and the FBI (John Hotis)--has been working for

eight months reviewing FBI procedures in many areas and drafting

guidelines to govern those procedures in the future. The Committee

has produced draft guidelines covering White House inquiries,

Congressional

and Judicial staff appointment investigations, un-

solicited mail, and domestic security investigations. It is

currently at work on guidelines covering counterespionage. in-

vestigations and will later consider the use of informants, the

employee loyalty program, organized crime intelligence investiga-

tions, criminal investigations, and other aspects of FBI practice.

The Committee's work has been extensive and time-consuming. "It

has involved not only questions of proper safeguards but also of

efficiency in the proper functioning of the Bureau. It has

been an effort to translate into words the complicated and

important mechanisms for controlling the FBI. I hope the

Committee's efforts at articulation will be of use to this Con-

mittee and others as it considers drafting legislation.

You have received copies of the latest drafts of the

guidelines that have been substantially completed by the Committee.

These guidelines do not yet represent Department policy. There

is disagreement within the Department on some aspects of these

guidelines. I have disagreed with the Conmittee recommendations

HH 55107 Do0Id:32989558 Page 96

---

## Page 97

-11' -

from time to time, and the FBI has raised substantial questions.

about other recommendations--particularly with respect to the

treatment of unsolicited mail. Some of the proposals in the

guidelines could be promulgated as departmental regulation.

Congress

may feel some ought to be enacted into statutory law.

Other provisions would require implementation by executive order.

I would be glad to discuss these draft guidelines with

you in detail in response

to your questions, but a brief discussion

of the guidelines on domestic security may be useful at the outset.

The guidelines begin by attempting to impose some order

and definiteness

to the domestic security field.. To begin

with, these guidelines do

not deal with FBI efforts to counter-

act the work of foreign intelligence services operating within

the United States.. Standards for determining when there is

foreign involvement sufficient to place a subject in the category.

of foreign counterintelligence investigation are now being debated

• within the guidelines committee: The domestic security guidelines

also are not meant to cover security or background investigations

of federal appointees or investigations of ordinary crimes: Under

the draft guidelines domestic security investigations are only

to be authorized when there is a likelihood that the activities

of individuals or groups involve or will involve the use of force

or violence in violation of federal law. Domestic security inves-

tigations are to be limited to activities of individuals or groups

intended to accomplish one of five purposes: overthrowing the

government of the United States or of a State; interfering with

the activities within the United States of foreign governments

NH 55107 DoOId:32989558 Page 97

---

## Page 98

- 12-

or their representatives; influencing government policies by

interfering by force or violence with government functions or

interstate commerce; depriving individuals of their civil rights;

and creating domestic violence or rioting when such violence

"or rioting would necessitate as a countermeasure the use of

federal armed forces. There is also a provision for limited

investigation when there is a clear and immediate threat of domestic

violence which is likely to result in a request by a state for fed-

eral armed assistance.

Currently there is no procedure requiring the review out-

side the FBI of all domestic intelligence investigations con-

.. ducted by the FBI. Under the draft guidelines there would be

a comprehensive program of reporting to the Attorney General or

his designee of all preliminary and

full domestic intelligence

investigations.. The Attorney General would be required under

the draft guidelines to put a stop to any full investigation whose

justification did not meet an established standard. The standard

would be that there must be specific and articulable facts jus-

tifying the conclusion that the individual or group under inves-

tigation is engaged in the activities I have just listed.

Anther feature of the draft guidelines is to place

strict controls upon the use of any technique by the FBI which

goes beyond the gathering of information. COINTELPRO was the

name given the use of some such techniques. As I have said

before,

some of the activities in COINTELPRO were outrageous

and

the others were

Foolish. Nonetheless, there may 'be circum-

HH 55107 DocId:32989558 Page 98

---

## Page 99

- 13 -

stances involving an immediate risk to human life or to extraordin-

arily important government functions that could only be

countered by some sort of preventive action. The guidelines

require that any such preventive action proposal be submitted

to the Attorney General. He could authorize the preventive

action only when there is probable cause to believe that the

violence is imminent and when such measures are necessary to

minimize the danger to life or property. The preventive action

would in all cases have to be nonviolent. The Attorney General

would be rquired to report to Congress periodically and no less

often than once a year on the use of preventive action by the

FBI.

I make no claim that during this rather difficult but

interesting and--I must trust--promising period, that we have

achieved all that might have been possible. In many ways the

work has been disappointingly slow. But I do think we have

made advances in nurturing and helping to improve a structure

which will be supportive of the best efforts of the men and

women in the Department of Justice and in the Federal Bureau of

Investigation. No procedures are fail-safe against abuse.

The best protection remains the quality and professionalism of

the member of the Bureau and of the Department.

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

INQUIRY CONCERNING PUBLICAIION "ON TARGET ARE CAS PLANKP

By letter dated 7-29-65 Senator Long advised that he had received a

letter stating that FBI Agent Leonard Frank called upon a person in Portland, Oregon,

to ascertain whether the person subscribed to the right-wing publication "On Target."

He commented that the writer of the letter was curious to know how the FBI knew of

the subscription and why such subscription could cause a visit and lengthy questioning

by the FBI. He stated he was equally curious and asked "Could you help us out?"

Senator Long is Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Administrative

Practice and Procedure. He has been taking testimony in connection with mail

covers, wire tapping and various snooping devices on the part of Federal agencies.

He cannot be trusted and although the FBI has not become involved in these hearings

our name has been mentioned quite prominently on several occasions. His letter of

July 29th is an inquiry as Chairman of the Subcommittee and is not an inquiry from

one of his constituents.

"On Target"' is a publication of the "Vinutemen," a radical right-wing

group which has as its main purpose the formation of an underground organization

ORIGINAL

equipped to overthrow our Government should it come under communist control. We

have been actively investigating the "Minutemen" to determine whether the activities

of the organization and/or its members are in violation of any Federal statutes over

which the Bureau has jurisdiction, the present aims and purposes of the organization

and any information concerning plans to overthrow the present Government of the

United States and whether any of the individual members through their activities

pose a threat to the life of the President or other public officials.

M. A. Jones to DeLoach Memo

RE: SENATOR EDWARD V. LONG (D - MISSOURI)

individuals and organizations throughout the United States. This mail was copies of

"On Target"' and was mailed to several individuals, organizations and members of

Congress. These mailings indicated that the organization was going underground, that

the FBI was investigating them and that they would never surrender. At that time

the field offices covering the residences of the individuals to whom this publication was

being mailed were instructed to review their indices, conduct credit and criminal checks

and contact logical informants concerning them. In the event no reason to the contrary

existed, these individuals were to be interviewed. SA Leonard E. Frank, GS-13,

assigned to Portland, advised that under this program he interviewed seven individuals.

Bufiles indicate that SA Frank did interview certain individuals in the Portland area

concerning their possible affiliation with the'Minutemen" It is apparent from the

results of these interviews that SA Frank did query them, among other things, con-

cerning their receipt of the publication, "On Target." This was in accordance with

instructions given Portland and several other field offices who were instructed to

Interview the recipients of the publication,

"On Target." It appears from the results

"of the interviews, however,

that the interviews were not centered on the publication,

"On Target," but were interviews encompassing the entire activities of the "Minutemen."'

OBSERVATIONS:

We must be most circumspect in our dealings with Long. We did nd

interview the person in Portland principally because of his receiving "On Target,"

but because of his possible affiliation with the "Minutemen." However, we should not

advise Long that we received these names from the Postmaster in Richmond, Missouri.

It is believed that we should reply to Long merely by stating that we are actively

investigating the "Minutemen"' in view of their avowed purpose and during the course

of this investigation have contacted numerous individuals believed connected with the

organization. Long was not polite enough. to furnish us either with the identity of the

individual who wrote to him or the date of the alleged contact by the Bureau, so we

should tactfully ignore his inquiry as to how we knew a certain individual was a sub-

scriber to "On Target."

RECOMMENDATION:

1. That the attached letter go forward to Senator Long.

Dear Ms. Hoover:

Have received a letter stating that FBI Agent

Leonard Frank called upon a person in Portland,

Cregon, to ascertain whether the person sub-

scribed to the right-wine publication on Target.

The person in question did so subscribe to that

publication, as well as many publications of all

kinds.

The

person in question was curious to

know how the FBI knew of the subscription and

why such subscription should cause a visit and

lengthy questioning by the FBI.

I am equally curious.

Could you help us out?

THOMAS VILLIAM LA VENIA

INQUIRY FROM THE SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE

ON ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES

RaymondE. Cole, Jr., Chief Investigator of the Senate Subcommittee on

Administrative Practices and Procedures,

Senator EdwardV. Long (D - Missouri),

Chairman, telephonically contacted SA David W. Bowers on October 1, 1965, inquiring

about the possibility of securing information from the FBI on Thomas William LaVenia.:

Cole explained the Subcommittee, which has been inquiring into the use of wire taps,

microphone surveillances, mail covers and the like, was planning some hearings intò

such activities by privaie investigators. He said LaVenia has the reputation of being

one of the most active private wire tappers in the local area. Bowers gave Cole no

indication that we do or do not have information about LaVenia and no indication that

any information could be furnished to the Committee.

Bufiles contain more than 75 references to LaVenia and the following

has been obtained from a review of main files and summaries only.

LaVenia was born 7-23-11 in Brooklyn, New York. He holds a law

degree from St. John's College in Brooklyn and has worked in the past as a lawyer in

New York, for the U.S. Secret Service, on active duty with the Navy, for the Office of

Price Stabilization and the Senate Subcommittee headed by the late Senator McCarthy.

A special inquiry we conducted in 1954 revealed LaVenia, while

employed by the Secret Service and stationed at Hyde Park, New York, was involved

in alleged improper activities involving heavy drinking and disclosing the nature of his

jassignment to a telephone operator he was dating. LaVenia claimed he was on a special

assignment to act like "a playboy, " and one of his superiors confirmed assigning

LaVenia to an Administrative investigation at Hyde Park in 1943 and stated he conducted

an excellent investigation and uncovered a "rotten mess" which could have been

embarrassing to the Service. Other information developed during this investigation

indicated LaVenia was of unsavory moral character and that he had been Vice President

of the American Law Students Association in 1936. This group was cited by the

House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1946 as a communist front.,

M. A. Jones to DeLoach Memo

RE: THOMAS WILLIAM LA VENIA -

LaVenia in 1954 was denied security clearance by the Department of

Defense while he was employed as an investigator on the McCarthy Subcommittee and

LaVenia subsequently was asked to resign from the Subcommittee. (121-33003 and

77-47707)

LaVenia was associated to some degree with former Agent John Joseph

Frank who was sentenced to prison for a violation of the Registration Act for his

involvement with the Dominican Republic. LaVenia traveled to the Dominican Republic

in October, 1955, with Frank but there was no indication that he was involved in illegal

activities and he subsequently testified before the Federal Grand Jury investigating

Frank's activities. (97-3293-128)

LaVenia allegedly was involved in 1958 in an effort to identify Govern-

ment witnesses scheduled to testify against Vito Genovese, leading New York racketeer.

He reportedly engaged a former FBI Agent in this effort. (92-2709-33)

In 1962-63 LaVenia was involved in the bribery investigation of C. Louis

Knight of the Federal Power Commission, Paul Kayser of the El Paso Natural Gas

Company and others. LaVenia, on interview, admitted being hired by Kayserito

investigate Knight. He also admitted paying approximately $12, 000 to former

Senator Earl C, Clements for Clement's use in locating witnesses to oppose Senate

confirmation of Robert Bicks to the Antitrust Division in the Department of Justice.

The Department advised in May, 1963, that prosecution in this matter was not

warranted. (58-5270)

OBSERVATION:

There would appear to be no harm in our confidentially advising Senator

Long of the foregoing information on LaVenia and in doing so this would afford you (Mr.

DeLoach) an opportunity to talk with Senator Long and perhaps ascertain future plans

of his Subcommittee

RECOMMENDATION:

That Mr. DeLoach contact Senator Long to confidentially brief him on

LaVenia and to determine future plans of Long's Subcommittee.

DATE 11100 BYS/ZALMKP

Senator Long called from Kansas City Monday afternoon, 11/29/65.

(This matter was telephonically reported to the Director that same afternoon.)

The Senator stated that United States Attorney Miller in Kansas City was his

appointee. He stated, therefore, he was quite shocked when Miller approximately

two weeks ago gave a speech in which he severely criticized Senator Long and the

¡activities of his subcommittee. The Senator stated that Miller on 11/27/65 held a

press conference, at which time he gave reporters principally the same critical

remarks as given during the above-mentioned speech. Miller, however, during the

press conference also indicated that the Director was displeased over the activities

lof Senator Long and his subcommittee.

Senator Long told me that apparently Miller had seen the Director

recently and was quoting the conversation of that particular meeting.

Senator Long told me that he rather hesitated to cooperate with the

FBI if we planned to attack him, particularly in his home state. He stated he

recognized our problems and he planned to specifically lay off any matters of

technical installations involving espionage or internal security. At this point I

interrupted him and stated that during our last telephonic conversation he had

agreed that he would lay off any exposure of FBI activity with respect to organized

crime or high ranking criminal operations.

The Senator stated that this was

correct; however, he would depend upon my approaching him on each occasion when

we found out his subcommittee had wandered into the field of organized crime or

criminal activity.

RE: LONG SUBCOMMITTEE

FBI activity in Kansas City and came close to exposing activities regarding

espioriage in San Francisco. The Senator stated that this was true; however, he

had talked to me since then and had given me a commitment. I stated, nevertheless,

the Director had a right to express concern over the activities of Fensterwald and

Cole, two of the Senator's assistants.

The Senator stated he felt better after discussing the matter. He

asked if the Director would issue a public statement indicating that this entire

matter had been discussed with him, Senator Long, and that an agreement had been

reached, that Senator Long would definitely not interfere with FBI activities in

¡ the internal security or espionage fields. I told the Senator that I didn't think that

he had thought this matter out very clearly. He asked why. Ithen mentioned that

once Mr. Hoover issued a statement to the above effect that the "Washington Post, "

"New York Times" and the Senator's own home state paper, "The St. Louis Post-

Dispatch" would most certainly take the FBI to task for intimidating members of

Congress. I stated this also would represent a very grave reflection upon the

Senator himself. Senator Long stated he had not thought of this angle and he

agreed. He once again indicated that he felt better after clearing this matter up

and he hoped that we could get together in the near future.

With the approval of the Director, I called Bernard Fensterwald,

Chief Counsel, Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure, late in

the afternoon of 12/22/65. He was not in. When he failed to return my call by

12/23/65, I called him at 10:30 a.m.

Fensterwald was advised that we were in receipt of his letter dated

December 20, 1965, attaching enlarged X-ray photographs of an alleged miniature

listening device. I told Fensterwald that, pursuant to his request, the FBI

Laboratory had examined the X-ray photographs and had indicated that this

examination revealed nothing which would indicate the manufacturer of the device

in question.

Fensterwald indicated appreciation and stated that he felt the X rays

did not reveal sufficient clarity in order to identify a source. He stated in the

near future it might be possible to find an A-44 telephone terminal block which

could be taken apart and the listening device removed. He pointed out that no

efforts would be made to do this until aiter the first of the year. I made no comment

in this regard.

With the Director's approval, Mr. Gale and I saw Senator Edward Long M

(D-Missouri) at 2:00 p.m. today in his office. Conference lasted for one hour and

N

a halt.

To lay the groundwork, I told the Senator that we approached him with

"clean hands" and wanted to be completely honest and aboveboard.

I stated that

apparently he was concerned about FBI activities in Las Vegas and that we were pre- .

pared to use Las Vegas as a perfect example of justification of FBI activities. In

general terms, I outlined to the Senator the skimming operation in Las Vegas and told

him that these funds, delivered by couriers to various points around the United States,

had been used for such reprehensible activities as prostitution, narcotics, financing of

hoodlum interest in legitimate businesses and many other enterprises to the detriment

of mankind and the internal security of the country.

The Senator expressed confusion in the differences between wire taps

and leased line microphones or stationary microphones. The differences were clearly.

explained to him. He was told that the FBI had no wire tap coverages whatsoever of

criminal activities. He was told that we did have at least ten leased line microphones

in Las Vegas and that we were in his office for the specific purpose of justifying our

activities in that regard.

REC6 62-98826-231

At this point we told the Senator that apparently the real basis of his

invasion of privacy hearings turned on the fact of whether installation of wire taps and

microphones was controlled or uncontrolled. I told him that the FBI had never

participated in usage of electronic devices, wire taps, microphones or otherwise, in

an uncontrolled manner. I stated this was true of Bobby Kennedy's term in office as

well as Attorney General Katzenbach's term. The Senator interrupted to state that

Katzenbach had implied to him that Kennedy had not known of FBI usage of leased line

microphones. I told him that this was absolutely false and Mr. Gale and I were pre-

pared to prove the falsity of this claim. At this point we showed Senator Long the

August 17, 1961, memorandum which former Attorney General Kennedy signed.

DeLoach to Tolson memorandum

Re: Senator Edward Long

We also read to Senator Long certain excerpts from the Director's

letter to the, Attorney General dated January 5, 1966 (copy attached) in which the

Director pointed out numerous instances which proved that both Kennedy and

Katzenbach had sanctioned and approved of FBI usage of wire taps and microphones.

Senator Long stated there was no doubt in his mind but what the FBI had complete

approval for such activities. He stated he was glad to learn this information inasmuch

as he dislikes Bobby Kennedy very much. He added that he has no bve for Katzenbach

because he feels that the entire Department of Justice is still a Kennedy haven.

Senator Long stated that he personally felt that former Attorney General

Kennedy was behind the uncontrolled sprees of wire tapping committed by Internal

Revenue. He stated that Kennedy obviously used Internal Revenue for political reasons

and that actually some of his friends had been hurt. I interrupted the Senator to state

that Kennedy nor Katzenbach had ever had the guts to order the Director to do any

political wire tapping and that the Director would have resigned his job rather than go

along with nefarious tactics. The Senator stated he regarded the Director as an

honorable man and had high respect for the Director.

At this point, I turned to Mr. Gale and asked him to show, in rough

draft chart form and in pictures, some of the activities of the Cosa Nostra hoodlums

on whom we had leased line microphones in Las Vegas. We, of course, at this point

were attempting to shock Senator Long both as to the vast amounts of knowledge

gathered as a result of microphone coverage and of the importance of gaining intelli-

gence of such coverage.

The amount of money in skimmed funds which made its way into La Cosa

Nostra coffers from Las Vegas was outlined in considerable detail to the Senator,

including ostensible ownership of record by straw men in Las Vegas, and in a detailed

outline of the real owners, i. e., such Cosa Nostra figures and key associates as Vito

Genovese, Meyer kansky, etc. The Senator appeared to be genuinely surprised as to

the extent of Cosa Nostra influence and domination in the Las Vegas casinos as well as

to the amount of take which was being skimmed oft and distributed to key La Cosa

) Nostra leaders throughout the Country•

Pictures of some of the bombings and killings ordered by Cosa Nostra,

such as the CAVBOMB case out of Youngstown wherein an 11-year-old boy was killed

and another son of Charles Cavalaro was crippled, were shown to the Senator. He

was obviously shocked at the savagery of these Cosa Nostra activities.

It was explained to him in detail the kangaroo court tactics utilized by

Cosa Nostra in sentencing their victims to death. The lack of judicial safeguards and

the fact that a trial of this type takes only several minutes and mere suspicion

DeLoach to Tolson memorandum

Re: Senator Edward Long

instead of evidence is sufficient to convict the victim was set forth for the Senator's

information. It was pointed out to him that compared to the extralegal activities of the

Cosa Nostra bosses, the "invasion of their privacy" by microphone coverage was indeed

dwarfed by their vicious activities. The number and magnitude of gangland killings

throughout the countsy was pointed out to the Senator including the fact that over a

thousand of these gangland killings had taken place in Chicago during the past 25 years

with only two being solved.

At this point Senator Long stated he could recognize why the FBI had to

"fight fire with fire."

It was pointed out to Senator Long that as a result of our micro~

phone coverage we had been able to alert potential victims and forestall a considerable

number of gangland slayings which had been planned by Cosa Nostra. He quickly

added that he had been afraid however that the FBI had used microphones on "peanut

gamblers and hoodlums. "

He mentioned that hearings in Kansas City had convinced him

that the FBI was using electronic devices on people not worthy of such attention. I told

him that we were glad that he had brought up that point. I stated we were prepared to

meet the challenge and wanted to outline to him some of the activities in his own home

state.

We then used the case of Salvatore Palma. I told him that the FBI had had a

leased line microphone on Palma and that he was one of the so-called "peanut hoodlums"

to which the Senator had recently referred to in a press release. I told the Senator that

unfortunately this "peanut hoodlum" who had committed armed robbery, burglary, and

assault and who constantly associated with Cosa Nostra chieftains, had been found

murdered just outside Kansas City last week. I mentioned that the leased line micro-

phone we had once had on this individual would probably have told us who murdered this

man and why; however, of course we had taken off these microphones once the Senator

started squawking about them. Senator Long appeared to be a little shocked at these

revelations and he became even more shocked as we gave him a number of other

examples in the Kansas City and St. Louis localities.

We also bretled the Senator with respêct to certain Cosa Nostra activities

in Chicago and New York. In fact, he was briefed to the extent that he eventually

halted the conversation by stating,

"You've firmly convinced me. " He went on to state

that he did not want to hurt the FBI in any manner and he felt that what we had been döing

was entirely justifiable. He stated he could see no objections to FBI usage of leased

line microphones as long as they were restricted to coverage of Cosa Nostra members or

top hoodlums and racketeers. I told him that Mr. Hoover would not consider such

coverage on unimportant individuals. He was further told that our Agents, unlike those

of other agencies, were never allowed to independatly operate in installing such devices

and the Director would fire a man forthwith if he even pondered en such activity.

Senator Long spoke lengthily about his great difficulty with Internal

Revenue and how this agency, unlike the FBI, had attempted to lie to him. He stated in

all fairness that Secretary Dillon and Commissioner Cohen probably did not know what

Re: Senator Edward Long

was going on in their own organization. He stated that if Internal Revenue had

approached him with the same honesty and frankness that the FBI had, there would

have been no difficulty.

Senator Long reiterated that he could see no objection to the FBl using

leased line microphónes in coverage of Cosa Nostra or hoodlum activities provided

these were considered to be topflight cases. We again impressed upon him the fact

that no installations were allowed unless they were fully justified and approved by the

Department. We told him of course that we had no microphones on at this particular

time. He expressed surprise and stated that he had not meant to hurt us with his

hearings. We told him that the hearings had been harmful in this regard and we had

/ lost considerablé intelligence as a result.

The Senator spoke briefly of espionage and internal security cases and

stated that there had never been any question whatsoever about the FBI handling such

activities. I told him that the various Presidents, including Mr. Johnson, and the

Attorneys General down through the years had approved such usage.

We told the Senator that his Committee should possibly look into

draft statement of approximately four or five instances in which"private eyes, such

as characters like Bernard Spindel, had involved themselves in usage of electronic

devices. This of course is all public source information which is widely known. The

Senator immediately grabbed for the memorandum however and stated he was very

appreciative. We told him that we possibly could be of assistance from time to time

in furnishing him further information in this regard on a completely off-the-record

basis.

Senator Long stated he had another problem wherein we might be able to

be of assistance. He stated he knew that the FBI was quite close to Dick Amberg,

Editor of the St. Louis "Globe-Democrat. " He stated that the other Newhouse news-

papers were very friendly to bim, however, Amberg had cut him to pieces on occasions.

I told the Senator that very much off-the-record, if the opportunity presented itself,

we might try to put in a good word for him with Amberg, particularly as to how the

Senator had been of assistance in connection with not attempting to harm the FBI in his

hearings.

The Senator stated he thought this was a great idea and he would deeply

appreciate it.

Senator Long asked if we could meet with him later on this week at

which time he would have his Chief Counsel, Bernard Fensterwald, also present.

He

stipulated it would be an off-the-record meeting. He further stated that the FBI

possibly had the opinion that Fensterwald was anti-FBI. He stated this was not true,

Re: Senator Edward Long

that Fensterwald respected the FBI but actually disliked Internal Revenue because of a

personality clash with Commissioner Cohen. We told the Senator that the Director had

instructed us to meet with him at any time and that we had no objections to Fensterwald

being present as long as the meeting was strictly off-the-record. He mentioned that he

would deeply appreciate Fensterwald receiving the same type of briefing that we had

given him.

The Senator stated that the next most important thing to discuss was a

procedure by which he could "get off the hook." He stated that unfortunately a number

of people were bringing pressure on him to look into the FBI's activities in connection

I with usage of electronic devices. He stated he had to make some statement or take

some action which would relieve this pressure. I told him that perhaps he might

desire to issue a statement reflecting that he had held lengthy conferences with top FBI

officials and was now completely satisfied, after looking into FBI operations, that the

FBI had never participated in uncontrolled usage of wire taps or microphones and that

FBI usage of such devices had been completely justified in all instances. The Senator

immediately seized upon this idea and stated he completely agreed. He stated that he

(frankly did not know how to word such a release but would struggle with it. I told him

that we would be glad to prepare the release for him on a strictly confidential basis.

He stated he appreciated this offer and would gladly accept it. He asked thai we have

the release ready by the time we met later on this week.

This of course will be done

immediately.

OBSERVATION:

We have not completely resolved this issue yet. There is still the

handling of Fensterwald who can be tricky. Both Mr. Gale and I feel that Senator Long

is now thoroughly convinced of the complete justification of FBI activities. While we

are hopeful of convincing Fensterwald or at least using Senator Long, his boss, to

convince Fensterwald, there can be no assurance of this until we have had our meeting

later on this week. There is no doubt but what we have won over Senator Long. He

thoroughly understands the justification for our activities and feels that we should

continue the usage of leased line microphones in either security or criminal work.

His statement: "I agree that you must fight fire with fire" was used many times by.

him throughout the hour and a half conference.

ACTION:

(1) That the Director approve our meeting with Senator Long and

Fensterwald on a completely off-the-record basis later on this week.

Crime Records Division, will immediately prepare a suggested press release

which Senator Long can issue and which will thoroughly absolve the FBI of any

wrongdoing whatsoever in the usage of wire taps and microphones. This release

will thoroughly reflect the justification for FBI usage of such devices.

SUBCOMMITTEE ON ADMINISTRATIVE

EREIN SAUNCEASSIFIE

ATE LUMO

By memorandum dated January 10, 1966, Mr. DeLoach advised

Mr. Tolson of a conference which he and Assistant Director Gale had had with

Senator Long of Missouri. During this discussion, Senator Long stated that a

number of people were bringing pressure on him to look into the FBI's activities

in using electronic devices, and he stated he had to make some statement or take

some action which would relieve the pressure.

Mr. DeLoach suggested to Senator Long the possibility of issuing

a statement reflecting that he had held lengthy conferences with top FBI officials

and that his Subcommittee had conducted exhaustive research--with the conclusion

the FBI had not engaged in highhanded or uncontrolled use of electronic devices

and that our carefully limited use of such equipment has been justified in all

instances. The Senator expressed his complete agreement with this idea and

'indicated a desire that we prepare such a statement for him in strict confidence.

Attached, on unwatermarked bond, is a proposed statement for

Senator Long's use. This statement was prepared in cooperation with the Special

Investigative Division. It is written from the viewpoint of the Senator and his

Committee in that it indicates they have taken a long, hard look at the FBI and

have found nothing out of order--but that they will continue looking over our

procedures and techniques from time to time in the future. Such an approach is

felt to be essential if the statement is to have the desired effect. A statement

reflecting a stronger pro-FBl position might not only prove ineffective in thwarting

those persons who are exerting pressure on the Subcommittee for a probe of our

operations, but it could also bring criticism and adastional pressure on senator, tons.

RECOMMENDATION:

ENCLOSURE,

That the attached statement (which is undated and on unwater marked

bond, be approved so that

can confidentially be handed to Senator Long later

this week.

end, my staff and I have not only conferred at length with top officials

of the FBI, but we have conducted exhaustive research into the activities,

procedures and techniques of this agency.

While my staff and I fully intend to carefully review FBI

operations from time to time in the future, I am at the present prepared

to state, based upon careful study, that we are fully satisfied that the

FBI has not participated in highhanded or uncontrolled usage of wire

taps, microphones or other electronic equipment.

The FBI's operations have been under strict Justice

Deparbuent control at all times. In keeping with a rigid system of

checks and balances, FBI installation of wire taps and microphones has

in the most important and serious of crimes either affecting the

internal security of our Nation or involving heinous threats to human

life. Included among these are major cases of murder, kidnaping,

and sadism perpetrated at the specific instruction of leaders of La

Cosa Nostra or other top echelons of the extralegal empire of

organized crime.

Investigation made by my staff has reflected no

independent or unauthorized installation of electronic devices by

individual FBI Agents or FBI offices in the field. We have carefully

examined Vir. J. Edgar Hoover's rules in this regard and have found

no instances of violation.

DATE I S PONEKASSIFIEI

Pursuant to Senator Long's request, and with the approval

of the Director, Mr. Gale and I met with Senator Long and his

Chief Counsel Bernard Fensterwald, Jr., in the Senator's office at

1,00 p.m. this afternoon.

The meeting lasted approximately two

and one-half hours.

This was the second meeting inasmuch as we

first met with the

Senator alone.

He asked that the same briefing

be given

his Chief Counsel, Bernard Fensterwald.

would

The Senator had previously agreed that the same ground rules

apply as during the first meeting, i.e., all remarks would be

on an oil-the-record basis.

I, nevertheless,

advised him of this

fact at the opening of this particular meeting.

We told Fensterwald, as with Senator Long, we wanted to be

perfectly honest and above

board and that we would' answer any

questions whatsoever he had on his mind. Fensterwald replied this

was satisfactory to him and he would have a list of questions to be

asked... At this point I generally briefed Senator Long and Fensterwald

regarding la Cosa Nostra and the complete justification and need fox

the FBI constantly being knowledgeable concerning the activities of

this organization. I then turned to Mr. Gale and asked him to

specifically brief the Senator and Fensteiwald concerning the situation

in Las Vegas.

The skimming operation in Las Vegas, together with its tie-ins

to La Cosa Nostra was outlined in detail to Senator Long and Fensterwald

In addition, the use to which skimming funds are put, i.e., control of

gambling enterprises, shylocking, etc., was outlined to him. Examples

of La Cosa Nostra extortion,

kidnapping and murder was related to

them and pictures and details of gangland slayings perpetrated by

La Cosa Nostra were set forth.

Specifically Mr. Gale mentioned the

cases involving Charles Cavallaro, Youngstown La Cosa Nostra member

who was slain together with his eleven-year-old son; William "Action"

involving John Biele, Frank Esposito, Dominic Alaimo and William

Marfeo.

The procedures

utilized by La Cosa Nostra in deciding

the guilt and sentencing one of their victims was explained to

Senator Long and Fensterwald, particularly, the fact that they

hold a trial which often times takes all of two minutes and sentence

their victim to death with no appeal. It is felt that these facts

made a considerable impression on Fensterwald and again on Senator

Long.

We made thepoint at this stage of the conversation that it

seems a little ludicrous to consider the civil rights of such

hoodlums have been violated by microphones being placed on them

when these same individuals are dealing in murder, racketeering and

complete sadism.

I told Fensterwald that contrary to some beliefs, the FBI

had never engaged in uncontrolled electronic devices.

I told him

that we had shown the Senator written proof of the fact that former

Attorney General Kennedy, as well as Katzenbach,

had fully subscribed

to the usage of wiretaps

and microphones utilized by the FBI.

Fensterwald was advised that we are prepared to show him the sane

documents we showed to Senator Long if he so desired. He replied,

"The boss has already seen these and is satisfied and so am I.""

We told Senator Long and Fensterwald of the well-disciplined

control the Director has over all of our personnel with respect to

any

devices or techniques that might possibly.

smack of violation of

privacy or civil rights.

We outlined the administrative controls in

effect on the usage of two-way mirrors on surveillance trucks,

sniperscopes (telescopic lenses for viewing at a distance),

recorders that can be worn around the body of a man, etc.

Senator

Long was most impressed.

At this point he stated he desired to use

the Director and the FBI as a shining example for all Federal

agencies to follow. Fensterwald agreed. I told the Senator and

Fensterwald that we came to them with complete honesty and clean

minds

They were advised that we were prepared to answer as to

our actions in any case whatsoever.

Fensterwald at this point asked several questions. He

specifically asked whether we had a microphone on the former

Superintendent of Police Maloney in Pittsburgh, Bernard MCGarry

in Boston and Milton Margoles in Milwaukee. He was advised that

we never had any microphone coverage on any of these individuals.

He inquired as to whether we had any wiretaps on the La Cosa Nostra

figures. He was advised we had no wiretaps on La Cosa Nostra

figures.

He questioned whether we had placed any microphones on

any individual for the Internal Revenue Service.

He was advised

in the negative. He likewise asked whether we had had Internal

Revenue place any microphones for us. He was advised in the negative.

He also asked whether the Federal Bureau of Narcotics had asked us

to place any microphones for them.

He was advised they had not.

In this regard it will be noted that he indicated that the Federal

Bureau of Narcotics was one of the most flagrant violators insofar

as the invasion of privacy of individuals was concerned. Fensterwald

also asked if we had a microphone on Senator John Williams (R)

01 Delaware. He was told that we had not ever placed a microphone

or wiretap on any member of Congress.

Fensterwald inquired as to whether or not former

Attorney General Kennedy had ever requested the FBI to place a

microphone on matters strictly pertaining to politics.

• told

Ithat Kennedy had not had the nerve to do this.

He was further

advised that Mr. Hoover would have tendered his resignation

immediately had

Kennedy attempted to force the FBI to do such a

reprehensible thing.

At this

point Senator Long interrupted and

referred to the Deputy Sheriff who served as a witness in hearings

in Miami, Florida.

He said this Sheriff testified that the FBI had

requested him to place wiretaps in a criminal case. I told the

He was then told

Miami Agents to inter-

view this man and pin down the falsity of his claim. He was told

this man admitted he had made a mistake and that under no circumstances

had the FBI requested him to place any wiretaps. The man further

admitted his knowledge was strictly hearsay and rumor. I told

Senator Long

we were not satisfied and had gone to the original

source of this rumor and this man had fully indicated the FBI had

not been involved in this matter.

The Senator was advised we were

prepared to give him a complete set of facts in this regard if he

wanted them. He indicated this would not be necessary.

Fensterwald inquired as towhether or not we had placed any

microphones ol anyone on behalf of the Fairfax County Police. He

was advised in the negative.

He then made the observation that the

Fairfax County Police had been indiscriminately tapping wires and

that the telephone company had brought a number of these cases to

, their attention. He stated he was well aware the fairfax County

Police had all the equipment necessary to tap wires and the Committee

contemplated subpoenaing the Chief of Police in the near future to

testify in this regard.

Fensterwald inquired if the FBI knew of any wiretap experts

that former Attorney General Kennedy had on his payroll while in

the Department of Justice. He specifically inquired as to one

Walter Sheridan. I told lensterwald that we knew of no specific

incident Wherein Sheridan had tapped wires or used microphones;

however, in strict confidence Sheridan had served as a runner" for

Bobby Kennedy and obviously carried out many assignments for Kennedy.

I mentioned also that Kennedy and Sheridan had been instrumental in

initiating a céquest that the Director

assign them a large number

of Agents to conduct investigations. I told them that the Director

had steadfastly refused to do this inasmuch as the men vere to be

only on "fishing expeditions."

I mentioned, of course, the former

Attorney General did not like having his adverturesome request turned

down and this was one of the reasons he had not likedthe FBI during

his term of office.

Fensterwald asked whether or not Carmine Bellino had tapped

Assistant

Kennedy was in the White House.

I told Senator Long that President

Johnson had fired this man immediately after taking office.

Fenstervald

indicated that he planned to subpoena both of these men in the near

future.

Senator Long asked if we would furnish him on a strict, off-

the-record

basis,

what FBI files contained on Sheridan and Bellino.

I told him we had little or no information other than what was

indicated in their personnel files. He stated he would appreciate

receiving anything we

had.

Fensterwald next inquired whether or not the FBI knew a

Thomas Lavenia, a private deteative.

He also asked if we knew

anothe private detective, Richard bast. He was told that we knew of

the names and both had rather unsavory reputations; however, we knew

of no specific cases of wiretapping or use of microphones involving

Senator Long said he had one last request and that was

to be furnished with a confidential memorandum concerning Lavenia

if at all possible.

We told him that this would be taken under

consideration.

At this point Fensterwald and Long were extremely critical of

the accomplishments which Internal Revenue had obtained in their

organized crime drive. Long again referred to the individuals Internal

Revenue had obtained convictions on as "minnows." Fensterwald said

that they had asked Internal Revenue to give them the names of the

individuals who had been indicted and convicted in connection with the

organized crime drive and that Internal Revenue had refused to give

this information to them.

НН 55107 Do0Id:32989558 Page 139

## Page 140

MEMO TO: MR. TOLSON

RE: SENATOR EDWARD • LONG

At this point we outlined some of the Bureau's major

accomplishments in the organized crime drive, particularly concentrating

on such gangland leaders as Sam Giancana,

Milwaukee Phil Alderisio,

Murray Humphreys, Frankie Carbo and a number of others in the same

category.

They were advised that the individuals. that we were

successful in proceeding against were either top echelon leaders

or trusted lieatenants, who were an integral part of La Cosa Nostra.

Senator Long stated there was no question in his mind that

the FBI had made quality contributions in the fight on organized

crime and he was certainly impressed by our accomplishments.

He

was advised that we, of course, would have no reluctance in giving

convicten lote list of all the individuals who have been indicted and

as a result of FBI investigations.

At this point Senator

Long said he was completely satistied as to the fBi usage of micro

phones in the organized crime field and top racketeering field;

however, some procedure or legislation had to be established which

would prevent other agencies from committing uncontrolled usage of

electronic devices. Fensterwald agreed.

We reiterated the policies and procedure related at the first

meeting with Senator Long insofar as the FBI never places a microphone

on any individual

who could be possibly slassified as "small fry."

Fensterwald stated he could understand

this fact; however, Internal

Revenue and Bureau of Narcotics most certainly had not participated

in controlled usage of such devices.

Senator Long quoted an

Internal Revenue official as stating "We have no hesitation

in

violating the law inasmuch as we don't believe in such laws."

Fensterwald stated that the pressure brought by various segments

of the press to subpoena FBI officials for hearings had been terrific.

I told him that undoubtedly the New York Times and the Washington Post

and other extremely liberal newspapers had wanted to see the FBI

crucified. Senator Long spoke up to say that he thought this situation

could be resolved by issuing a statement to the press.

He asked me

if we had brought up a statement which was discussed at the previous

meeting in his office.

I handed him the statement and told him that

as he could see the statement was heavily weighed on the side of the

Committee.

The Senator read the statement and said it was entirely

satisfactory with him.

He handed it to rensterwald who, after

reading it, stated he "would like to sleep on it for one night."

Fensterwald stated the statement might be sufficient to get them off

the hook; however, some members of the press had been adamant that

the FBI be called. He stated a few members of the press had told

him the Committee was afraid to call the FBI. Fensterwald then inquired

as to what harm could be done in holding hearings in Las Vegas and

having FBI witnesses testify.

MEMO: DeLOACH TO TOLSON

RE:

SENATOR EDWARD LONG

I told Fensterwald that such hearings would be damaging in

many ways.

The intelligence and information gathered thus far would

be rapidly dissipated inasmuch as the organized crime mobs and

La Cosa Nostra would rapidly and completely revamp their "skimming

off" and courier set up

to the extent that we would have to start

again.

I told-him that it would be very difficult to ascertain in

what direction hundreds of thousands of dollars were going if the

underworld learned through the medium of hearings exactly what the

FBI knew at the present time. I told him also that while we do not

condone gambling in any shape form or fashion, nevertheless,

Senator Long might like to think about what harm could befall his

fellow Senators, the Governor of Nevada and the economy of the entire

state if FBI information concerning organized crime in Nevada broke

forth in the newspapers.

The Senator agreed. He stated under no

circumstances would he want to hurt the FBI's Las Vegas activities.

over

I also told him at this point of the great efforts being

made by Attorney Edward Bennett Williams to make a "deal" with

the Justice Department to get a look at FBI files regarding Las Vegas

activities.

I stated this was a perfect example of the lengths that

hoodlums and hoodlum attorneys would go in an attempt to find out

what the FBI had on them.

I also informed him that such hearings

might well jeopardise live informants as a result of information

La Cosa Nostra and the gambling leaders would be able to gather

therefrom.

Fensterwald was also advised by Mr. Gale that there is a

pending appeal in the Milwaukee Alderisio case and that any hearings

might well be frowned on by the Supreme Court inasmuch as they

might well interfere with the matter under consideration by the Court.

Fensterwald stated that he and the Senator obviously would

not want to hold any hearings that would serve to damage the fBi

reputation or Its investigations Involving organized crime.

Senator Long asked me if the FBI was satisfied that former

Attorney General Kennedy had definitely known of the intelligence

received

as the result of microphones in Las Vegas.

I reiterated

once again the record that had been established in this regard,

including the fact that former Assistant Director Evans, who

maintained liaison with Kennedy, had personally briefed

regarding the usage of microphones by the FBI.

At this point I

RE: SENATOR EDWARD LONG

the Director had sent Attorney General Katzenbach, only to receive

a double-talk distorted memorandum back from Katzenbach, attempting

to deny the tact that Kennedy was cognizant of such activities.

senator Long stated that this was reprehensible. He asked if the

Director had advised the President of this matter.

I told him the

Director had not; however, the opportunity might present itself

lat sometime in the future.

Senator Long asked if there was any evidence that Kennedy

had at any time known of the usage of microphones by the various

investigating agencies of the Treasury Department. I told him

once again of the memo which was handed to Kennedy by Commissioner

Caplin of Internal Revenue at a meeting in the Treasury Department

in 1961.

The memo in question clearly revealed the usage to which

the Internal Revenue Department planned to use microphones in their

drive against organized crime. Senator Long stated he was very

grateful to know this.

Fensterwald asked if we had any microphone on any criminal

¡cases at the present time.

He was

told we did not.

He asked why

not. I told him that the

Director had felt that because of the

failure of the Attorney General to back us up and also because of

the activities of

senator Long's'Subcommittee, we had removed such

microphones.

Senator Long said he had no objections to the usage

of microphones in top hoodlum and La Cosa Nostra cases as had been

outlined to him.

He stated the type of control exercised by the

Director obviously put the FBI in a different light than other

Linvestigative agencies.

Fensterwald asked if the FBI utilized microphones in

conference or interview rooms, in Washington or throughout the

|field.

He was told that we did not.

Fensterwald stated that he

had interviewed a former Agent at which time this man told him that.

to attempt to use a microphone without obtaining the approval of

FBI Headquarters in Washington was more or less an attempt to "commit

suicide."

Hewas told that we basically agree with this mang that

there was no incident whatsoever in which an Agent, without complete

authority from both the Director and the Attorney General, had placed

a wiretap, microphone or any other listening device.

At this point Senator Long stated he was one hour overdue to

make a videotape for television.

He stated he was completely

satisfied as to the FBI's activities and he would be glad to advise

the President that he had no quarrel with the FBI. He stated that

questions at this particular time.

Ve attempted to thank the Senator and Fensterwald, however, they

appeared to be much more grateful than we did.

The Senator

expressed the hope,

in conclusion,

that some day soon he could

come down to the FBI and tour our facilities.

He laughed and

stated this would not mean the place where microphones were made

but rather thé regular tour taken by the tourists.

we would be glad to have him at any time. He stated the Director

would probably not remember him; however, one of the greatest

ACTION:

The Special Investigative Division will review files on

Walter Sheridan, Carmen Bellino and private eye Thomas Lavenia.

I do not think

that we should go much beyond the information in

the out-of-service personnel files of Sheridan and Bellino. It

may

be that we do have

some information on Lavenia that would be

of interest to Senator Long, including public source information.

A memorandum will be submitted attaching the suggested information

that we recommend be given to Senator Long on a completely

confidential basis.

It appears obvious, of course, that Senator

Long thoroughly dislikes former Attorney General Kennedy and will

luse such information against Senator Kennedy•

continued usage of microphones in criminal cases to the Attorney

General. While it is believed that Senator Long and Fensterwald

Pursuant to instructions, I went over to the Attorney General's office

at 7:15 p.m., 1/20/66, relative to the captioned matter. Mr. Gale accompanied me.

The Attorney General read the Director's letter to Senator Long dated

1/20/66 then turned to me and stated that, "If the FBI feels that this letter might do

some good with Senator Long I will be glad to approve it. " He stated he had no

objections to this letter and personally hoped that it would prevent senator Long from

harming the FBI in any manner. He asked how I felt about the matter. I told him

that the letter certainly couldn't do any harm and might be of some benefit. He agreed.

The Attorney General brought up the matter of the forthcoming confer-

ence with the President on the subject of organized crime. He stated he had no idea

as to how this conference should be handled. He indicated he knew that he would, of

necessity, run the conference in the capacity of Attorney General, however, he felt

that "some of the stars" should definitely be called upon in the briefing of the President

He then stated that obviously the Director should handle a considerable part of the

briefing. He of course has in mind also calling upon one.or two of the other agencies

The Attorney General stated this conference would last for approximately 25 minutes.

The President will take part of this time in responding to the remarks previously

Imade to him concerning organized crime. The Attorney General had no further infor-

The Attorney General stated he missed having lunches with the Director.

to an order to impound the specific FBI logs concerning Levinson. He gave me the

attached memorandum which he stated he would like returned to him. He pointed out

that he thought this plan had possibilities.

Basically, Assistant Attorney General Douglas' idea encompasses the

following provisions:

(1) The defendants (which of course means FBI) shall deliver to the

court by

which any defendant or defendants may have made or received as result of any

lof course means FBI logs).

(2) The attached order stipulates that these records shall be sealed and

impounded in the custody of the court upon delivery.

(3) The order further stipulates that Levinson shall be afforded access

to the impounded records for a reasonable time to be fixed by the court and for the

sole purpose of inspection.

of said records.

personally does not desire to remove this case from state court. He feels that the

state authorities have the opinion they have a specific prerogative to keep this matter

in state court. This is a silly argument. The Attorney General told Mr. Gale and me

that there was a distinct possibility that Levinson might see the logs anyhow if the

pending case ever went to trial; consequently, the Attorney General felt there would

be no objection to Levinson seeing the logs in court chambers.

WAR UN GAMBLERS

IN NEVADA CURBED

Suit Against Bugs by F.B.I.

Hinders U.S. Prosecutors

By WALLACE TURNER

Speclal to Thie New York Tunes

WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 -

/Electronic eavesdropping by the

Federal Bureau of Investigation

'at Las Vegas casinos has crea-

ted serious problems for the

Justice Department in its pro-!

secution of Las Vegas gamblers.

The problems arose as a direct!

of a suit for $6,000,000

damages filed by Edward

Levinson a Las Vegas casino

operator. He charged that an

"bug" in his office had

invaded his privacy..

The suit was filed last month

by Mr. Levinson,

the Fremont Hotel. Its impli-

cations are far reaching.

The suit and attendant detail

Trespass Issue Invad

The problem for prosecutors

dealing with evidence gathered

by such devices arises

because

almost

without

exception the

"bug"' has been planted through

trespass.

Evidence, such as the

in

this way, cannot

Federal law on this question

is clear. Eavesdropping with the

¡admissible evidence. But a tres-

protection have included homes,

apartments, hotel rooms, even

Concealing a microphone "in

these protected places is a tres-

pass, the courts have held. Thus

evidence so obtained is

changing values of electronic

eavesdropping as an investiga-

Wiretapping in the

usual sense is not at issue, al-

though telephone lines were use

to

connect

concealed

micro-

phones to listening devices some

distance away.

Wiretap Evidence Barred

A telephone tap is illegal un-

der a section of the Federal

Communications

Act of 1934

that prohibits interception and

divulging of telephone conver-

sations.

Telephone tapping has

falien into disrepute among law

enforcement officials. Increas-

ingly,

the evidence it yields is

being barred by the courts.

The law on electronic eaves-

dropping is more complex, since

it traces to the Fourth Amend-

ment guarantees against seauch

and seizure. Thus the rules arel

based on court decisions, not on

statutes.

Generally,

evidence

from

such eavesdropping may

not be used.

The suit filed by Mr. Levin-

son and a companion suit filed

by his associate, Johnny Grandy,

will cast a cloud for

long

time to come on evidence pre-

sented by Federal prosecutors

in any case connected with Las

Vegas gambling.

The Levinson suit is a straight

demand

for

damages

from

agents of the Federal Bureau

of Investigation and from the

Central

Company

Prior to discussing official

his saninistrative Assistant, Baled that the subject of the discussion

business matters all parties

would be completely off the record, as usual.

Senator long had on his desk the statement which we had pre

viously prepared for him.

He stated he had been reading the statement

over and had a

few reservations as to whether the statement should be

issued at this time. He agreed that the statement was truthful in

all aspects; however, he expressed the opinion that issuance of the

statement would perhaps pour gasoline on

the fire.

He referred to the

New Xork Times article of 1/21/66 by Wallace Turner, stating that this

article had caused a

few raised eyebrows, no doubt,

and that a release

by him, senator long, at this time, completely clearing the fBl, woulo

in effect cause further articles.

He indicated that the article was

Iboth against his subcommittee and the FBI.

I presented the Director's letter to Senator Long and told

Thim that he might want to read this letter carefully prior to making

up his mind. He did read the letter and stated it vas a fine one.

His Administrative Assistant, Miles,

also read the letter and indicated

no objection to it. I pointed out that the letter was most strong

in praise of the Senator and specifically that the Director had

commensed the Senator and his subcommittee on the fact that they were

attempting to establish guidelines against indiscriminatemand

uncontrolled wire tapping in the future.

I|he had given

the whole matter a great deal of thought and that he

personally believed it would be far better to wait a short period

of time and release both the Director's letter and his statement in a

status report af the final report of his committee. He stated ho

Inad not given

up the idea of issuing both the statement and the

lettex

at this time; however, he thought it would be best for both the rBI

and his committee ii he could wait brielly until the current furore

Iby the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times had died down somewhat.

I told the Senator that, regardless of his actions, some

reporters would have mental halitosis and attempt to embarrass both

the Senator and the FBI, whether the statement was issued or not. He

was advised that reporters usually bring criticism for three or four

days and then forget the matter completely.

He was told that 95%

of the papers in the United States would praise him for his actions,

particularly papers in his home

state, such as the Kansas City Star

and the St. Louis Globe-Democrat.

The Senator stated this was all true; however, he felt it

¡ise said the time was just not right.

would be unwise to make a public' statement at

this specific time.

The Senator was

told that it was, of course, his prerogative

as to when he wanted to issue the statement and the letter. However,

he was advised we wanted

to be informed when he planned to make such

a release.

He stated he might decide to make such a release in

San Francisco on 2/2 or 3/66.

I then asked him point blank whether or not he intended to

hold hearings concerning the fBl at any time in the future. He stated

he did not. I asked him ii he would be willing to give us a commit-

ment that he would in no way embarrass the EBI. He said he would

lagree to do this.

Fensterwald asked if it would be possible for me or Mr. Gale

"to appear before the Long subcommittee in San Irancisco and make a

¡simple statement to the effect that the FBI used wire taps only in

cases involving national security and kidnaping and extortion, where

¿ life is involved, and used microphones only in those cases involving

heinous crimes and Cosa Nostra matters. He stated no further questions

"would be asked.

I told lensterwald that to put an IBI witness on the stand

would be an attempt to open a Pandora's box, in so far as our enemies

lan the press were concerned.

He was advised

that such an appearance

as only a,token witness would cause more criticism than the release

or the statoment in question could ever cause.

Senator Long stated

The had no plans whatsoever for calling fbl withesses.

Fensterwald advised that the hearings in San Francisco would

flast for two days. He stated the hearings would 95% concern the

Internal Revenue Service, and 4% concern private detectives and

industrial espionase.

He indicated there was a possibility of the

remaining 1% involving the BI.

We asked him if he had any witnesses

in this regard, and he replied that he had one

_ex-agent. He pressed

thim for the identity of this ex-agent.

He stated it was a man who

had spoken very highly of the. FBI and that we could suffes no harm

"because of his testimony. I asked him again the name of the ex-agent.

He finally admitted his name was William turner.

I told l'ensterwald that Turner was a first class s.o.b.,

a liar, and a man who had volunteered as a witness only to get a

I briefed all parties present as to Turner's background

and told them why he was aismissed with prejudice. I told the senator

that Turner had strongly objected to being transierrea ixom seattle,

Washington to Oklahoma City, because he objected to mingling with

"hicks" and "Bible-thumping Baptists" (Senator Long is a Baptist)

Nin the West and Midwest.

Fensterwald indicated maybe they had better look at Turner

a second time. He insisted, however, that Turner had been most

favorable concerning the IBI initially. I told him this was only for

the purpose of soft-soaping rensterwald so that he could be called as

lla witness.

Senator long stated he had spent nost of yesterday, 1/20/66,

with President Johnson in Independence, Missouri and Kansas City.

He stated the President had asked questions concerning the subcommittee

hearings, and the President had been most interested in this matter.

He indicated that the President had shown to him, Senator Long, the

1961 memorandum which had been exhibited by the Commissioner of

Internal Revenue at a meeting in the Treasury Department which was

attended by Bobby Kennedy. Senator Long stated the President was •

to sum up, it was our understanding that we had a commitment

from him

that he would not bother the FBI.

He stated this was true and that

we could have his word in this regard.

that at the conclusion of his

The following concerns an interview of former FBI

SA Barrett George Kemp by Staff Members of the SSG.

By letter dated November 7, 1975, to the Department

of Justice from the SSG,

it was indicated that its Staff

desired to interview FBI SAs who had handled former FBI informant

Gary Thonas Rowe, JI=

One of these handling agents was

identified as former SA Barrett George Kemp who currently

resides and practices law at Saint Marys, Ohio. The FBI waived

Kemp's confidentiality agreement for the purpose of the inter-

view which was to be contined to his lorner handling of former

informant Rowe.

Prior to the interview,

the legal Counsel Division

of the TBI advised kemp that he need respond only to those

questions

pertaining to his former handling of Rowe.

Ile was

also told that there were four privileged areas concerning

which he was not required to answer questions.

These areas

were: matters pertaining to ongoing IßL investigations;

information fron third agencies,

including foreign Intelligence

agencies;

infornation which would reveal identities of

confidential sources; and information concerning sensitiva

methods and techniques.

Specific matters covered during the interview,

Kemp, in

handling Rowe, had encouraged Rowe to connit violence.

Over and over again, Kemp emphasized that at no time, did he

encourage love to connit violence and that as a matter of fact,

he had many times admonished Rowe to avoid such involvement.

Kelley inquired into Kemp's employment history in the

Bureau which was supplied and showed that Kemp left the Bureau

in 1961 Kelley desired intormation as to how kemp developed

Rowe as an infornant, It being noted that Kemp

was the agent tho

first developed Rowe

as an informant and therefore, was the

first handling agent.

Inasmuch as Kemp understood his clearance

from the FBI was to discuss only the handling of Rowe,

as

distinguished from developing Rowe into an informant, Kemp

refused to discuss developmental aspects. Ilkewise,

and using

the same rationale, Kemp said he refused to discuss with the

SSG

the paper work procedures in the Bimingham Office at the time

he handled Rowe or anything concerning the chain of command in

that office.

DECLASSIF ED BY SPRALMKP

20530

We have been asked to chair a special subcommittee

of the Select Committee on Intelligence which will con-

centrate on matters relaring to domestic intelligence

activities of the Federal

government.

Our mandate is to

prepare for the full committee's consideration a draft

report of findings of fact on alleged abuses or excesses

by the FBI and other domestic intelligence agencies; the

causes of such

alleged abuses or excesses and recommendations

which the Committee might make to remedy the problems we

have uncovered.

We are aware of the fine work in which your staff has

been engaged in these areas and hope that they will be

available to work with the Committee staff on these matters.

However, the Subcommittee finds the Committee record needs

to be supplemented in several important respects and there-

fore finds it necessary to direct a number of requests to

the FBI

for further information which we hope will be

treated on a priority basis so that the Subc. mmittee can

meet the deadlines set by the full committee.

These and

future requests which will be handled between the tro

committee counsel or Mi. Ellift, Domestic Task Furce Leader,

ana Mir. Shaneen, Special Counsel for Intelligence Coor

dination, will pertain to both information necessary for

us to formulate meaningful recommendations and to pursue

matters on certain specific alleged abuses which remain

unsettled. Among the future requests will be questions

pertaining to your guidelines on "Domestic Security Inves-

tigations"

and on manpower and budget statistics for the

FBI's domestic intelligence program.

For us to meet the deadline set by the full committee,

i/is essential that the information requested below be
