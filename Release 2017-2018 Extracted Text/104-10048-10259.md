MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Frank Anthony STURGIS

This morning I received a phone call

Frank Sturgis called the DUD,

]who advised me that yesterday

expressed a desire to meet with one of the

officers.

Sturgis claimed to have new information

on the movement

of narcotics through Mexico and

other information which he did not specify.

The DCD Miami Office thanked Sturgis for

calling and referred him to the FBI.and DEA,

who would be the most interested recipients of

the information he has.

Sturgis was very pleasant

the telephone and the DCD people obviously

responded correctly.
