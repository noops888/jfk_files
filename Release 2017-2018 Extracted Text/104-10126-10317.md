MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting with Mr. Blakey

Mr. Leader and I met with Mr. Blakey and Mr. Cummins for

about an hour this afternoon.

2.

I told Mr. Blakey that I had spoken to the IG and he in-

formed me that we are authorized to give Mr. Cornwall access to the

unsanitized version of the comments on the Schweiker Report, subject

to his signing the same agreement signed by Mr. Blakey.

3. I took the occasion. to emphasize again our uneasiness with

some of the information exposed in the report.

I reiterated some

of the detail about persons in Cuba, as well as technical operations.

Reference was made once more to the effect on various foreign

I were to be

I expressed the opinion that the basic story could be told,

where it was judged appropriate to discuss a given subject, without

revealing sensitive sources and methods. I said that our work with the

Church Committee had been generally successful in this respect, and

that language could usually be worked out that would convey the story

while still protecting sources and techniques.

4. Mr. Blakey indicated that

at this point he felt that a number

of issues in our paper would prove irrelevant to his investigation.

I told him that I was of the opinion that a number of them are irrele-

vant to the issue, but that we were addressing the Schweiker Report

rather than the broader issue.

He indicated that he was specifically

interested in the airplane flight that had been treated in the Schweiker

Report, but that depending on how his investigation developed it might

become irrelevant as well.

For instance, if he concluded that right-wing

Cubans and criminal elements were responsible for the assassination a

flight to Cuba ceased to have meaning.

However, if there was occasion

to comment on that particular flight they would like to review the basis

for our treatment of the subject.

5. I expressed the hope that Mr. Cornwall would not need a number

of people to do the work for him, as we wished very much to hold down

the number of persons familiar with some of the operational detail. He

stated that he too wished to hold down the number.. I expressed the hope

that the membership of the staff would remain stable until the con-

clusion of the investigation a year from now. He indicated that he

would be here until a year from now when he returns to Cornell, where

he has tenure as a Professor of Criminal Law.

6. Looking to the time that he begins to pick the issues on

which he must write I expressed the hope that we would have as much

lead time as possible.. Only one or two Agency persons would be re-

viewing the draft report, and if we had to do so on a crash basis--

an experience faced in the past--it would be very difficult for us

to do a proper job. He recognized the problem but made no firm

commitments although he indicated his willingness to cooperate.

He

said that he plans to proceed on schedule and thinks that the report

will be written, reviewed and published by the end of 1978.
