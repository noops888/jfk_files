SUBJECT: SECURITY INVESTIGATION OF INDIVIDUALS

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

HEREIN IS MCLASSIFIED

PURPOSE

DATED dO BYREALMEN

To recommend streamlining procedures for handling

Reserve Index - A and Reserve Index - B investigations.

SYNOPSIS

Bureau responsibility in this field originated with

Presidential Directives, the first one in September, 1939.

The purpose of these investigations is to identify potentially

dangerous individuals who are affiliated with subversive move

ments.

This is field wide and is closely related to the

Emergency Detention Program which involves plans for the

apprehension and detention of potentialiy dangerous juividuals

in the event of an emergency.

The emergence of the new left and expansion of the

racial militant now poses dangers which parallel the threat

aL communism to the internal security. of the United States and

2.

The criteria for placing individuals on the Reserve

Index - A (RI-A) remain the same.

Current procedures

for annual reopening and limited investigation in

these cases be suspended at this time.

The field

office file for an RI-A subject should be reviewed

by the field whenever informant information or other

information is channeled to the file to determine if

additional investigation is warranted.

3.

The criteria for placing subjects on the Reserve

Index - B (RI-B) remain the same. The current pro-

cedures for reopening of these cases be suspended

at this time.

The field office file of an RI-B

subject be reviewed by the field whenever informant

information or other information is channeled to the

file to determine if additional investigation is

warranted.

4.

Maintenance of the RI-A and RI-E by the field office

and the Bureau will remain the same.

OBSERVATIONS

To bring RI-A and RI-B cases up to date by investi-

gation is desirable; however, it is felt that examination of

the case file by the field when new information is placed

in

the file will serve as a backstop to catch those cases which

have an accumulation of minor activity indicating that active

investigation is required. Coverage of subversive activity

through informants or other sources will reveal any activity

which will require active investigation. We are streamlining

our procedures without sacrificing essential controls,

changes will free manpower to handle investigations of emerging

new subversives in the "new left" movement.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. That attached SAC letter incorporating above

be approved.

2. That attached manual revisions be approved.

Memorandum C. D. Brennan to W. C. Sullivan

RE:

Security Investigation of Individuals

DETAILS

Presidential Directives, the initial one being issued

in September, 1939, and since repeated on several occasions,

charged the Bureau

with the responsibility of investigation of

individuals in the internal security field.

We are the col

lecting agency of the entire executive branch for subversive

information and have the responsibility of seeing that such

information is distributed to those Government agencies having

a legitimate interest in these individuals.

The purpose of

these investigations is to identify those individuals who

because of aftiliation with subversive organizations may present

a potential threat to the internal security of the United States

in the event of an emergency and the development of evidence

of violation of Federal statutes on part of

these individuals.

If it is determined that an individual does pose a potential

threat to the internal security of the United States, he is

scheduled for apprehension under the Emergency Detention

Program by the inclusion of his name in the SI. Close attention

is given these investigations to insure that we are fully dis-

charging our responsibility.

The emergence of the new left and the expansion of

the racial militant now poses dangers which parallel the threat

of communism to the internal security of the United States.

This expansion of work has put a serious strain

on our manpower. During the recent New York inspection,

observations were obtained recommending procedural changes

to streamline these investigations.

We also secured comments

of offices having a significant number of these cases.

In

line with the field comments and our own experience, we have

evaluated the standards for including or deleting individuals

on the SI and Reserve Index.

The SI represents those individuals who have been

determined through investigation to be dangerous or potentially

dangerous because of their membership in or affiliation with

or espousal of doctrines of basic revolutionary organizations

and/or front organizations no will-be apprehended upon receipi

of instructions from the Attorney General..

RE :

Security Investigation of Individuals

The criteria for placing and retaining names in the

SI is governed by the following:

No name shall be added to or retained in the Security

Index unless one or more of the following situations

have been established through investigation:

(A)

Subject has had membership or participation in the

activities of a

basic revolutionary organization with-

in the last 5 years as shown by overt acts or state-

nents established through reliable sources, inform-

ants, or individuals.

(B)

Subject has had membership or participation in the

affairs of one or more front organizations, which

achere to the policies and doctrines of a revolu-

tionary group, in a leadership capacity or by active

substantial participation in the furtherance of the

aims or purposes of the front organizations within

the last 3 years as shown by overt acts or state-

ments established through reliable sources, inform-

ants, or individuals.

(C)

Investigation has developed information that

individual, though not a member or a participant

In the activities or a subversive organization, has

anarchist or revolutionary beliefs and is likely to

seize upon the opportunity presented by a national

emergency to endanger the public safety as shown by

overt acts or statements within the last 3 years

established through reliable sources, informants,

or individuals.

(D)

Although investigation has failed to establish

overt acts or statements on the part of a sub-

ject within the time limits set out above, facts

have been developed which clearly and unmistakably

depict the subject as a dangerous individual who

could be expected to commit acts inimical to the

national defense and public safety of the U.S. in

time of emergency.

As of 1/26/68, the Security Index contains 10,109

individuals.

RS:

Security Investigation of Individuals

Then the field has completed an investigation and

the subject's activities meet the criteria for inclusion

in the SI; a report and FD-122 are submitted to the Bureau

with recommendations for inclusion in the SI. The substantive

Supervisor, Unit Supervisor in Charge, Section Chief and

Assistant Director of the Domestic Intelligence Division

approve the field's recommendation.

The employment and

residence of si subjects are verified every six months and

an investigative report is submitted annually.

The Reserve Index was established in 1960 to include

those individuals whose subversive activities do not bring

them within the SI criteria but who in a time of national emer

gency are in a position to influence others against the national

interest or are likely to furnish financial or material aid

subversive elements due to their subversive affiliation and

ideology. These individuals are scheduled to receive priority

consideration with respect to investigation following the

apprehension of SI subjects.

The criteria for placing individuals

in

the Reserve Index is as

follows.

Individuals are to be included in the Reserve Index when,

following investigation, the information does not justify

the inclusion of the subject's name in the Security Index

When

there is evidence of:

(2)

(10)

Membership in a basic revolutionary organization

subsequent to January 1, 1949, together with some

indication of sympathy or association with such an

organization or a subversive front organization

subsequent to the reported membership and no reliable

evidence of defection.

Investigation has failed to substantiate allegations

of membership in a revolutionary organization within

the past five years, coupled with some evidence or

infornation indicating activity, association, or

sympathy for the subversive cause within the

period, and no reliable evidence of defection.

Security Investigation of Individuals

(c)

The individual, within the past five years, by

his

associations, writings, financial support, or

conduct in relation to and support of subversive

organizations or the international communist move

ment is in a position to influence others at the

time of a national emergency and no reliable evidence

of defection.

(d)

Leadership or substantial activities in a major sub-

versive front group over three years ago, together

with some evidence of continuing activity, association,

or sympathy for the subversive cause within three

years and no reliable evidence of defection.

(e)

Membership in a subversive front organization within

the past three years and no reliable evidence of

defection.

The Reserve Index is divided into two sections,'

Section A and Section B.. If a subject does not meet the

criteria for the sI or is deleted from the si, he is con-

sidered for either section of the Reserve Index.

Those

individuals who are included in Section A fall within the

following categories: professors, teachers and educators,

labor union organizers, writers, lawyers,

doctors and other

potentially influential

persons

on a local or national level

or individuals who could furnish material or financial aid.

Current procedures call for investigation of those individuals

in the RI-A to be reopened and brought up to date annually

and considered for SI status or retention in the RI-A.

This

investigation is

limited to verification of residence and

employment, check of informants and file review to determine

if additional investigation and/or submission of a report

is warranted. Section B contains the names of all other

individuals in the Reserve Index and is maintained only by the

field office.

These cases are reopened every two years.

The

investigation is limited to verification of residence, em-

ployment and contact with logical informants.

If the results

of the case are negative, the case is then closed.

SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS

SYNOPSIS: This is to recommend obtaining Departmental approval

for amended criteria for individuals on Security Index (SI) and

to set up Priority Apprehension Program based on dangerousness of

individuals on SI.. Present criteria for SI include individuals

in basic revolutionary groups, front groups, anarchists, and those

with anarchistic tendencies.

Department has recently amended.

definition of

a dangerous person in new Presidential

Emergency

Action Document 6, broadening it to include terrorists or persons

who would interfere with Government operation and defense effort.

With Director's approval, conference was held with

Departmental representatives and in view of amended definition

of a dangerous person referred to above, a corresponding amend-

ment

to Item D of SI criteria was agreed upon. (Set out in

details, page 7, and page 1 of memorandum to Mr. Can

In

addition,

our study of the entire Emergency Detention Progran sug

gests desirability of alterations to set up priorities for

apprehension based on dangerousness of individual. Priorities

would include:

1) Priority I. Top national and state leadership of basic

subversive organizations, leaders of anarchistic groups, individ-

uals who have shown greatest propensity for violence, as well as

those who have special, training in sabotage, espionage, guerrilla

warfare, etc.

Subversives

cluded.

Present individuals designated Key Figures would, if

appropriate, be in this category.

priority III. All other individuals on SI.

Made up

mainly of rank and file members. Verification of residences and

employments to remain at 6 months with submission of reports

each 2 years.

4) Each priority will be broken down into nationalistic

tendencies and organizational affiliations so that apprehensions

can be made in each category on a selected basis.

5) Changes will not alter total number of individuals on

SI and not materially affect SI.

OBSERVATIONS:

Implementation of program will continue to require

authorization of Attorney General for any apprehensions. Priority

lists will streamline effectiveness of Program to allow us to

"zero in" on most dangerous and influential individuals and will

permit us to "lop off" top level inmediately it program impiementea.

This should result in paralyzing organizations, and subjects with

lesser priorities would lose top leadership and could be appre-

hended at later time, if necessary. Since SI made up principally

of rank and file, we

will save approximately. 3,500 reports per

year while at same time we will intensify coverage of those cor-

sidered most dangerous.

This presents logical and workable program

, while cutting back substantially on desirable but unnecessary

paper work and is in line with our continuing analysis to stream-

line by cutting out unnecessary requirements and retaining only

that which is absolutely essential.

RECOMHENDATION :

That attached letter to Department setting forth above

proposals be forwarded.

Upon Department's approval, appropriate

Instructions and manual changes will be sent to the field.

Memo for Mr. W. C. Sullivan

RE: DETPRO

DETAILS:

The responsibilities of the FBI with respect to

investigations in the internal security field have been

established by Presidential Directives.

The primary purpose of the investigation of sub-

versive individuals is to determine their identities and

activities and/or whether they present a serious threat to the

internal security of the country. If investigation develops

positive evidence indicating that an individual presents a

threat or potential threat to the internal security, his name

is included in the Security Index.

The Security Index contains names of individuals who

should be considered for immediate apprehension and detention

in the event of a national emergency in order to safeguard the

"internal security of the United States by preventing sabotage,

espionage, and insurrection.

The list now consists of over

10:000 names.

Additions and deletions are made when it is

determined that the individual either represents a threat or

no longer represents a threat.

A plan of action has been prepared to implement the

apprehension and detention of individuals listed in the Security

Index and for the seizure of specified contraband.

This plan is

formally known as the "Program for Apprehension and Detention of

Persons Considered Potentially Dangerous to the National Defense

and Public Safety of the United States." Details concerning

this plan are contained in

the Attorney General's Portfolio,

copies of which were originally furnished to this Bureau on

August 3, 1948. The proposed actions have been subject to con-

tinuous study, and revisions have been made as needed. The

proposed actions under this plan will be implemented by Presi-

dential Proclamation through Presidential Emergency Action

Documents (PEAD) •

The PEADs provide for the arrest and detention

o1 all persons, citizens as well as aliens, who are considered

dangerous to the national defense and public safety and for the

seizure of property which there is a reason to believe may be

used to the detriment of national defense and public safety.

The results of our investigations are provided to

the Department of Justice on a continuing basis for its con-

currence and approval of the persons listed for apprehension.

RE:

DETPRO

Detailed instructions are in the hands of all of our

field offices for the handling of this matter in the event we

are called upon to effect apprehensions of SI subjects. Plans

are also in existence in seven field offices for the handling.

of detainees on a temporary basis by the Army, and close

coordination is maintained between our offices and the military.

Departmental instructions from the Attorney General to United

States Attorneys, who will be the administrators of the program

following implementation, and to U. S. Marshals have been fur-

nished our offices at the Department's request for delivery to these

officials. The Immigration and Naturalization Service is respon-

sible for

the detention of alien enemies, and on a quarterly basis,

through the Department, the number of all aliens included on the

SI is furnished to them. This list is broken down by field office

and by sex.

The criteria for placing and retaining individuals was

approved by the Department on April 11, 1955. They are as

follows:

A.

B.

•C.

Membership or participation in the activities of a

basic revolutionary organization within the last 5

years as shown by overt acts or statements established

through reliable sources, informants or individuals.

Membership or participation in the affairs of one or

more front organizations, which adhere to the policies

and doctrines of a revolutionary group, in a leader-

ship capacity or by active substantial

participation

in the furtherance of the aims or purposes of the

front organizations within the last 3 years as shown

by overt acts or statements established through

reliable sources, informants, or individuals.

Investigation has developed information that an individual.

though not a member or a participant in the activities

of a subversive organization, has anarchist or revolu-

tionary beliefs and is likely to seize upon the opportunis?

presented by a national emergency to endanger the public

safety as shown by overt acts or statements within the

last 3 years established through reliable sources,

informants, or individuals.

the time limits set out above, facts have been

developed which clearly and unmistakably depict the

subject as a dangerous individual who could be expected

to commit acts inimical to the national defense and

public safety of the U.S. in time of emergency.

In November, 1967, the President ordered a comprehensive

review of the Presidential

Emergency Action Documents as to the

desirability of modifying or deleting certain standby orders.

The Attorney General served as the chairman of the comnittee

reviewing the documents.

After extensive review, in

A which the

FBI participated, a proposal was submitted to the President that

be revised.

It was proposed that the faergency

Detention Program be revised to agree with the provisions of the

Emergency Detention Act.

The Internal Security Division (ISD) of the Department

has raised questions as ts the ability. to discharge the respon-

sibilities of the Attorney General under the Emergency Detention

Act of 1950. By letter dated 2/26/68 the Department requested

a conference with the FBI for the purpose of reviewing the.

Implementation of the Emergency Detention Program.

The Director

approved memorandun not to ir. Anties dated

3/1/68, captioned "presidential Emergency Action Documents,"

designating Section Chief Ears and SA EnAMe

Internal security section, Domestic Intelligence Division, to

attend discussions with ISD.

One of the changes in PEAD pertains to the definition

of a "dangerous individual."

The document, which has been

approved by the president,

now states "The

Attorney General,

acting through such officers and agents as he may designate

¡OX

the purpose, shall apprehend, and by order detain, pursuant to

the provisions of the Emergency Detention Act, each person as

to whon there is reasonable ground to believe

that such person

probably will engage in, or probably will conspire with others

to engage in, acts of espionage and sabotage, including acts o1

terrorism or

assassination and any interference with or threat

to the survival and effective operation of the national, state,

and local governments andof the national defense effort.

As

used in this section, the term 'person' shall mean any citizen

ox national of the United States, or any citizen, subject or

national of any foreign ration, or any stateless

person."

• Memo to Mr. W. C. Sullivan

RE: DETPRO

The above

is an all encompassing definition of a

"dangerous person." This will extend the criteria for the

Security Index.

During the conference of 4/22/68 with ISD, the definition

of a dangerous individual was discussed, and it was decided

that Item D of the SI criteria should be expanded to include the

definition as stated in the new PHAD 6. It was also determined

that prior to implementing the EDP under the EDA additional

planning and prepositioning of necessary forms and documents

must be completed by the Department.

We are continually examining our procedures and policies

to eliminate everything except absolute essentials. We have

made a study of the Priority Apprehension Program procedures to

Insure that they are both current and meaningful. We also are

taking a hard look at the individuals on the st to justify their

retention.

With the emergence of the New Left and the intensification

of activities by the racial militants and black nationalists

are not affiliated with basic revolutionary organizations bus tho

because of their anarchist tendencies do present a threat to the

internal security of the United States, it has become apparent

that these individuals warrant inclusion on the sI.

Many individuals on the SI, because of their violent

tendencies and their representation

of the top leadership of sub-

versive organizations, are scheduled for priority apprehension.

The administrative procedures developed to make these apprehen-

sions are referred to as the Detcom Program. In an all-out

emergency, all subjects whose names are in the SI will be con-

sidered for immediate apprehension.

Our study indicates the necessity for establishing new

priority apprehension procedures which will continue to be based

on potential dangerousness of the individual. Accordingly, the

following suggestions are being made:

I. That the Priority Apprehension Program be continued under

the code name Detcom; that the program be divided into

3 priority levels and be named separately.

2.

That the first priority apprehension list be entitled

Priority I.

It is believed

that if these individuals are apprehended as scheduled

this will completely disrupt the subversive orgaizations

zation is in the best interests of the national defense

of the United States.

That a secondary priority list be entitled Priority II.

This group should consist of the second level leadership

of basic revolutionary organizations and other subversive

organizations or other individuals who present a signifi-

cant threat but are in less influential positions than

those in Priority I. These individuals will be apprehended

only when the Attorney General announces that their immo-

bilization is in the best interests of the national defense

of the United

States.

That a third priority list be entitled priority III.

preparation and handling of approxinately 3, 500 reports a year.

The field will promptly report any unusual or important

changes concerning a subject.

This will also release agent investigative time to

concentrate on those individuals deemed more dangerous and at

the same time not lose control over lesser subjects.

The field will continue to be required to know the

current whereabouts of all subjects.

It is believed that this program is logical and workable

and is in line with our continuing analysis to streamline our

We are substantially cutting back on desirable but

unnecessary paper work by cutting out unnecessary requirements.

It is believed these proposals will greatly improve the

efficiency of our work.

Cel guathout the curse out of the TA MORATON CONTANED

INDEX CARDS

HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED

AT QUANTICO

Under Vital Records Program a duplicate set of the master

sacurity Indes cards is maintained at the Quantico relocation site.

Additions, cancellations and changes of the Security Index are made

on a continuing basis to keep the Indez in a current status.

Under

our current procedures, when a Security

Index card is changed, the

old card. is then destroyed; when an individual is removed from the

Security

the card is cancellad and

is retained at the bureau

for a period oi j years Iiled alphabeticaily by year. Tue caris at

Quantico have been maintained on an indefinite basis.

We now have

25,000 cancelled Security Index cards stored at Quantico. These cards

are petained to sarve as a ready lisi of individuals no do not meet

the criteria lor the security index at this time; however, because

of previous

activities, they could represent a potential danger to

the interaal security of the U. S. in time of an emergency.

In line with our continuing analysis to streamline our

procedures, it is recommended that the cancelled security index cards

over 5 years old maintained at Quantico be destroyed and hereafter

be maintained for the period of 5 years filed alphabetically by year.

OBSERVATIOTS:

The destruction of these cancelled cards will release 4

file cravers of vitally needed storage space.

During this S-year

period il a subject's activities would warrant, he would be placed

DaCi

*::

on the

Reserve Index.

It is believed that

this

an individual's

activities would warrant reconsideration for inclusion on the

Security

index. This will serve as a backup for a ready list of

individuals who could be potentially dangerous in time of emergency.

basie revolutionary organizations and other subversive

organizations and individuals who present a significant

threat but are in less intluential positions than those

The third priority list will be entitled priority Ill.

This list will consist of all other individuals on the

Security Inder, It will be made up mainly of rank and

SUBJECT, PEAD 6: Criteria for persons to be appic.

taù.

and Priosity Apprehension Program

•This is in response to your request of May 16, 1968,

Fordinale concert me men me me me, .

of the existing criteria for determining persons to be ap-

prehended pursuant to that PEAD, and the acceptability of

the FBI's proposed Priority Apprehension Program. ,

Criteria

The criteria set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d)

on pp. 1-2 of your memorandum, and the background file cón-

taining the basis upon which these criteria

were approved by

the Attorney General on April I1, 1955, have been reviewed.

While no change appears necessary in the essential substance

of the criteria, the language used is in some respects unclear

and possibly inconsistent. The proposed revisions set forth

below are intended mainly to clarify what we understand to be

the meaning of these criteria. These sevisions are, of coursa,

subject to further change in the event that they do not accur-

'ately, reflect the intended meaning.

It is noted that the present criteria do not contain

(and we are informed that there do not exist) formal defini-

tions of the terms

"basic revolutionary organization"

, 'Levo-

lutionary group''

"front osganizations"

, of "subversive

organization". While more precise indications of what is

meant by these terms would be desirable, we have not insisted

on formal definitions at this time in view of (1) the require-

ment that any person actually detained will be entitled to a

''to

hearing at which time the evidence will have to satisfy the

standards of $ 1 of PEAD 6 and the Emergency Detention Act, and

(1]) the needed flexibility and discretion at the operating

level in order to carry on an effective surveilance program.

The revisions recommended below have been drafted to

correct the following problems raised by the language of. the

existing criteria:

(1) Paragraphs (a) and (b)

respectively, although we are informed that no difference in

meaning is intended.

(2)

Under paragraph (b, it would be sufficient to ap.

prehend a person on the basis of "active substantial partici-

pation in the furtherance of the aims and purposes of the front

organization." Since it is one of the basic characteristics of

a front organization that its announced aims and purposes may

be wholly innocuous, or even praiseworthy, it is conceivable

that some individuals might participate aetively in (and sym-

pathize with) only those activities of a front organization

that are related to unobjectionable purposes, and have no in-

volvement in those activities which relate to the aims and pur-

poses of a basic revolutionary. organization. The detention of

such persons would not appear to be appropriate in the absence

of other considerations:

(3) Paragraph (c) is made applicable only to a person

who is "not a member or a participant in the activities of a

subversive organization."

We have been informally advised by

the Internal Security Division, however, that the type of in-

dividual intended to be reached by this paragraph is likely to

belong to some form of organization, though not one that meets

the standards of paragraphs (a) or (b).

(4) As it is presently worded, paragraph (d) can be in-

terpreted as being no more than a special provision to include

individuals who otherwise qualify under one or more of para-

graphs (a), (b) or (c) except fos the faci that they have made

no overt acts or statements within the prescribed five or three

year time limits. The Internal Security Division has informally

advised, however, that paragraph (d) is also intended to serve

as a

catchall for certain individuals who do not meet the cri-

teria of paragraphs (a), (b) or (c).

2

SECRET

HH 55102 DooId:32989622 Page 26

## Page 27

(5)

Both paragraphs (c.) and (d) apply on the basis of

the likelihood that the different categories of individuals

that they describe will perform undesicable acts in the event

of an emergency. No reason is perceived why paragraphs (c)

and (d) describe differently the undesirable acts that such

individuals may perform, as distinguished from the facts in-

dicating the likelihood that they will perform them,

or why such description should differ from that in s 1 of

PEAD 6.

Accordingly, it is recommended that paragraphs (b), (c)

and (d) be revised to read as follows (underscoring indicates

or changed language) : .

" (6)

Subject has had membership or participation in

the affairs of one or more front organizations

which adhere to the policies and doctrines of a

basis revolutionary organization, in a

leadership

capacity or by active substantial participacion

in ile furtherance of those aims and purposes of

the front organization which coincide with those

of a basic revolutionary organization, within

the last three years as shown by, overt acts or

statements established through reliable sources,

informants, or individuals;

"(c)

'(d)

Investigation has developed information that an

individual, though not a member of or a partici-

pant in the activities of a basic revolutionary

or front organization, has anarchist or revolu-

tionasy belieis and is likely to seize upon the

opportunity presented by a national emergency to

commit acts of espionage or sabotage, including

acts of terrorism, assassination o any inter-

ference with os threat to the survival and ef-

fective operation of the national, state and

local sovernments and of the defense effort;

Although investigation has failed to establish

the facts required by (a), (b) or (c) above,

either as to the substance of those criteria or

because there have been no overt acts or state-

ments within the time limits prescribed, facts

have been developed which clearly and unmistakably

scribed in (c) above."

As we informally advised your office by telephone on

June 13, 1968, we have no objection to the proposed Priority

The report and verification requirements regarding SI

an SAC Letter has been prepared in order to advise each field

The SI consists of three priorities.

Reports pertaining

to individuals designated as Priority I Of the SI will henceforth

be submitted on an annual basis. Such reports were previously sub-

mitted on a semiannual basis.

Verification of their residence and

employment will continue to be conducted every three months.

The

verification of residence and employment of individuals designated

as priority il and priorily iii vi ine si will henceforth sa voriti

on an annual basis. Such verification was previously handled on

a semiannual basis. No other changes are being made regarding SI.

Verification of residence and employment regarding subjects on

Agitator Index is also being changed to a yearly basis. This vas

previously done on a semiannual basis.

The field is being instructed that the reduction in thê

'Irequency of reports for Priority I subjects and verification of

residence and employment of Priority II and Priority III subjects

should not be interpreted as meaning that security investigations

should be curtailed in any fashion.

In addition, the field is being

reminded of its responsibility, as well as the Bureau's responsibilit

to be aware of the location of

SI subjects so that in the event a

national emergency arises requiring the implementation of the Emer-

gency Detention Program (EDP), SI subjects can be located

for

apprehension and detention.

Each division is being instructed that

appropriate sources should be established to alert the Bureau in

the event an SI subject changes his residence and/or employment.

The establishment of such sources is vital in order that the Bureau's

responsibilities under the Idp can be fulfilled in the manner

expected.

SECURITY INDEX

The Security Index is designed for the purpose of

maintaining a list of individuals who should be apprehended

and incarcerated in the event of a

national emergency, such

as an attack from abroad or internal revolt. Such individuals

must be proven to be a definite threat to the national security.

All additions to and deletions from the Security Index are

approved in each field division by the Special Agent in Charge

or his designated representative; are completely reviewed by

Bureau supervisors who approve or reject the field recommendation;

and final approval is given by the Department. The Security

Index is based upon Iitle 2 of the Internal Security Act of 1950

and is a part of the over-ali Emergency vetention Program.

In June, 1968, we thoroughly revised investigative

procedures of individuals on the Security Index by setting up

priorities.

Individuals designated Priority I are hard core national

and state leaders of basic revolutionary groups or other sub-

versive organizations who have indicated propensity for violence.

Verification of their residence and employment is conducted

three months and™

a report submitted every six months

PEtersion

Reports

concerning such individuals were previously submitted on a

quarterly basis.

There were 647 individuals in Priority Ias

of February 14, 1969.

Individuals designated Priority. II fall in the second

level leadership of

such basic revolutionary organizations or

groups who have indicated a propensity for violence.

their residence and

Verification

employment is conducted every six months

with a report submitted on an annual basis.

There were I,738

individuals in Priority II as • February 1421969.

Priority III is made up of all other individuals on the

Security Index.

Their residence and employment is verified every

six months with

a report being submitted every

two yearS.

Reports

were previously submitted on an annuai basis.

As of rebquary 14,

1969, there were 7, 816 individuals in Priority III.

The Security Index is constantly changing through

penetrative review by the field, Bureau supervisors and the

the ex 1a,

Department.

We have been making anywhere up to 38 changes

SYNOPSIS:

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend

that the Department be consulted regarding the removal of

Priority III subjects from the Security Index (SI).

This

could in no way mean a lessening of investigative attention.

regarding individuals carried as Priority III SI subjects

but would mean concentrating our attention in areas most

essential to the internal security of the country.

These Priorities were established during the latter

part of April, 1968, as it was the Department's feeling that

all

individuals on the SI would not be apprehended in the

event of a national emergency, Uniy inose wiu die top leadeis

of the various groups (Priority I) would currently be considered.

for apprehension in the event of a national emergency with

follow-up consideration being given to individuals in a

secondary leadership capacity (Priority II). Apprehension of

rank and file SI subjects (Priority III) is extremely remote.

Of the 10,786 individuals on the SI, 8,125 are in Priority III.

These security subjects could be maintained on a subversive

index by the Bureau and in the event of an extreme national

energency, this list would be available for whatever action

is deemed

necessary by the President and the Attorney General.

The criteria for this subversive index would remain exactly the

same as for existing Priority III SI subjects.

After the initial

investigation in this category, necessary information could be

submitted by letterhead memorandum making the preparation of

investigative reports unnecessary. This could result in consider

able savings to the Bureau since routine investigation would not

be required after the initial investigation.

Memorandum to Mr. W.C. Sullivan

RE:

PROGRAM FOR APPREHENSION AND

DETENTION OF PERSONS CONSIDERED

POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS TO THE

NATIONAL DEFENSE AND PUBLIC

SAFETY OF THE UNITED STATES

DETAILS:

We constantly review our operations in the internal

security llela in an eltort to effect streamlining measures,

where possible, in order that the most effective use can be

made of the available manpower.

pertaining to routine Security latter - Communist cases, as

well as investigations of Priority II and Priority III SI

subjects, we are not at this time conducting our normal periodic

investigation of Priority III SI subjects.

In an effort to further streamline security investi-

gations and to effectively utilize the manpower available, it

is believed that we should at this time consult the Department

regarding the necessity to continue Priority III designations

on the SI. Priorities were established during the latter part

of April, 1968, as a result of conferences with the Department.

The establishment of these Priorities was confirmed by letter

to Assistant Attorney Conoral 2. Walter Yeagley dated May 1, 1958...

The establishment of Priority listings for SI subjects was

brought about by the fact that there were at that time over

10,000 individuals on the SI, and it was the feeling of the

Department that all individuals on the SI should not be appre

hended for detention in the event of a national emergency

requiring the implementation of the Emergency Detention Program.

The Priorities were established on the basis of leadership

capacity within the various organizations and groups.

Priority I was made up of all hard core national and

state

basic revolutionary organization leaders and leaders of other

subversive organizations and unorganized groups and individuals

who indicated a propensity for violence and/or had received

specialized training in sabotage, espionage, and/or guerrilla

warfare.

Priority II was based on second level leadership and

Priority III was made up of all others on the SI, mainly rank

and file members of the various organizations and groups.

It has been the feeling of the Department that in

the event of a national emergency the Bureau will be

authorized.

to apprehend and detain only certain individuals in Priority I.

There are currently 712 individuals in Priority I of the SI.

Memorandum to Mr. W.C. Sullivan

RE:

PROGRAM FOR APPREHENSION AND

DETENTION OF PERSONS CONSIDERED

POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS TO THE

NATIONAL DEFENSE AND PUBLIC

SAFETY OF THE UNITED STATES

Te could conceivably apprehend as little as 10 individuals

in this group or as many as the entire list of 712. The

Department has indicated that individuals included in

Priority II of the SI may possibly be considered for appre-

hension and detention, but this would be secondary and

would follow by at least a short period of time any

apprehension of individuals in Priority I.

It is doubtful

that instructions would be issued for the Bureau to apprehend

anyone in Priority III of the SI. This is based on the theory,.

which appears to be sound, that the immediate removal of leaders

would effectively paralyze the various organizations and thereby

remove considerable potential for acts inimical to the best

interests of

the nation.

It is, therefore, believed that we can delete Priority

III from the actual SI without in any way seriously affecting

a lessening of our vigilance pertaining to security matters

and the responsibility of this Bureau to take necessary steps

to safeguard the internal security of this country. Although

these individuals would no longer be carried on the actual

SI,

we would maintain their names on a subversive index which

would contain the same information as does the SI. Investigations

would be initiated

on individuals concerning whom

we receive

information of a subversive nature and an initial report would

be submitted much as we now do recommending that this individual

be included on this subversive index or that no further investi-

gation be conducted based on the results of the investigation:

If the individual meets the criteria for being included on this

subversive index,

subsequent information could be submitted to

the Bureau by letterhead memorandum rather than an investigative

report which is the current practice regarding Priority III SI

subjects.

This would result in considerable savings

to the

Bureau in investigative, Agent and stenographic time if and when

the current moratorium

regarding certain phases of security

investigations is lifted.

As you are aware, the moratorium which was placed

into effect during March, 1969, affected investigations and

submission of reports regarding Priority II and Priority III

SI subjects and in addition, suspended routine Security Matter

Communist investigations, We are, therefore, in effect not

currently investigating these Priority III SI subjects nor

are reports being submitted concerning them based on the

moratorium. The removal of the Priority III subjects from

RE:

SAFETY OF THE UNITED STATES

the SI will cause little or no effect on the current workload

at the Seat of Government or the field. It will greatly

assist the field once the moratorium is, removed since the -

field will be able to immediately initiate investigations in

the security field without having to bring up to date the

8,077 Priority III cases.

This step is also deemed necessary since the moratorium

on security investigations has actually resulted in an increase

in the total SI of over 500 cases.

The total listing on the SI

as of March 1, 1969, was 10,208, approximately 7,826 of whom

were included in Priority Ill.

The total SI as of October 15,

1969, was 10,786, approximately 8,125 of whom were Priority. III.

A portion of

this increase is directly attributable to the

moratorium since existing cases

are not being periodically

reviewed for removal from the SI. A study has been made and

the increase in the over-all SI

during the first six months of

the moratorium was 4.9 per cent.

Since the moratorium has been

continued we can anticipate that the over-all SI will increase

by approximately an additional 5 per cent before March, 1970.

The rate of increase in the SI for a similar period

prior to the moratorium was at a rate of 0.72 per cent. This.

level was maintained since we were constantly reviewing existing

SI cases for deletion.

The deletion of Priority III subjects from the SI

will result in an efficiently organized Si that will be

completely workable, especially under emergency conditions.

It is noted that as of October 15, 1969, there were

8,125 individuals included in Priority III of the SI.

If these

8,125 individuals were, in effect, removed from the SI, we

would have a remaining SI totaling 2,661..

We will continue to maintain Priority designation

on the SI and the standards for the Priority designation will

not be lessened to permit any widespread redesignation of

Priorities.

With the maintenance of the individuals currently

listed as Priority III SI subjects on the subversive index

a complete list would be available in the event the national

emergency deteriorated to such an extent as to warrant the

apprehension and detention of all individuals considered to

be subversive.

HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED

DATE/012:00 BYSBALM/L

R. D. Cotter to, Miller, memorandum 9/17/71, Captioned as above,

reported congressional repeal of Emergency Detention Act (EDA) and

indicated a study would be made as to how our Security Index (SI) Program

could best be maintained and used without EDA. Director noted "Expedite."

History of Security Index

Essentially, our Security Index is a list of those individuals who

have been identified as subversives who represent a potential danger to the

national security in time of emergency and who would have been apprehended

and detained under the provisions of EDA. As a matter of fact, our

SI predates passage of Title II of the Internal Security Act of 1950, the

statute containing EDA which hasjust been repealed. Prior to 1950, SI

subjects would have been apprehended and detained under authority derived

from Executive Order supported by joint resolution of House and Senate.

The Act repealing EDA, however, would apparently preclude any

future use of such executive authority, since it amended Title 18, U.S. Code,

to insert the language "No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained

by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress.."

Need to Continue SI

Although the Government does not currently appear to have any

authority to apprehend and detain subjects listed in the SI, we feel that

continuance of SI is an administrative necessity to the FBI,, if not to the

Department also, for the following reasons:

Those listed now or included under existing criteria in the future

will continue to represent a potential danger to the national defense. Should

this country come under attack from hostile forces, foreign or domestic,

there is nothing to preclude the President from going before a joint session c

Congress and requesting necessary authority to apprehend and detain those

DocId:32989622 Page 50

Memorandum for Mr. Miller

RE: EMERGENCY DETENTION ACT REPEAL

SECURITY INDEX PROGRAM

who would constitute a menace to national defense. At this point it would be

absolutely essential to have an immediate list, such as the SI, for use in

making such apprehensions. The SI, backed by our investigative files, would

provide documentation of subversive backgrounds during any hearings

which might be required following apprehensions.

The SI constitutes an extremely valuable list of subversives and

malcontents who constantly pose a threat to the safety of the President.

Secret Service is provided a constant flow of data concerning current

whereabouts and backgrounds of individuals on the SI. In addition, the SI

would immediately pinpoint for our own use the identities of subversives

who:: would require intensified investigative attention to provide evidence of

espionage, sabotage or the like.

Operation of SI

Currently the field makes recommendation for an individual's inclu-

sion in the SI and the Bureau either concurs or disapproves the recommendation.

It is bolioved this procedure should continue, However, when it has appeared

that some reason exists for removal of an individual from the SI, we have

sought advice in this regard from the Department. Departmental concurrence

in our listing of SI subjects was based on the possibility of such subjects

being apprehended under EDA. Since apprehension is not currently possible,

it is believed that the Bureau should decide whether an individual should be

removed or retained in the SI. We will, of course, continue to disseminate

our security reports to the Department.

We have furnished the Department a monthly list of subjects on

Priority I and Priority II (those subject to probable emergency apprehension)

and this list was the basis for a continuing review by the Department of

subjects to be retained on SI. For the above-named reasons we believe that

the Department should no longer make the decision as to who is retained or

removed from SI. However, the Department may desire to continue to receive

the monthly list for information purposes.

Quarterly we have furnished Passport Office of State Department a

list of those on Priority I (the most potentially dangerous) so that we can be

advised of travel abroad by these subjects. The list is not identified in any

way as SI and since it is beneficial to us, it is believed we should continue to

send it.

Effect of Repeal on Future Investigations

Repeal of EDA raises question of what effect such repeal may

have, in a legal sense, for the FBI to conduct investigations of this type.

In other words, do we have statutory authority or mandates such as

Executive Order as bases for our investigative authority?

A quick perusal of Section 87, Manual of Instructions indicates

that EDA, which was Title II of the Internal Security Act of 1950, was only

a small part of our overall investigative authority. Title I of the Internal

Security Act of 1950, which relates to Subversive Activities Control Board,

strengthened by Executive Order 11605 dated 7/2/71, provides investigative

authcrity as do Smith Act of 1940, Communist Control Act of 1954. Fraud Avainsi

the Government, Rebellion and Insurrection, Sedition and Seditious Conspiracy,

among others.

However, it is believed that Office of Legal Counsel should

examine this more critically from a legal standpoint.

Observations

It is to be noted that the Department has an entire staff set up

to administer emergency apprehension of dangerous subversives. It is

believed that in the interest of national security the Department will make

some effort or provision to implement an alternative to EDA. It is therefore

felt that the Department would have a collateral interest in the FBI's

maintaining the Security Index without the provisions of emergency

apprehension.

It is believed that in face of the substantial Congressional

sentiment which resulted in repeal of EDA, we must exercise care not to

subject the Bureau and Director to unwarranted public criticism for

unilaterally deciding to maintain the SI, which might appear to be an

attempt to evade the will of Congress.

For this reason it is believed that

although we should continue to maintain the SI on a temporary basis,

we

deletion or additions thereto.

(2) Upon determining that the President has signed the Act

various above-mentioned reasons why the FBI should continue to maintain

SUBJECT: EMERGENCY DETENTION ACT REPEAL

SECURITY INDEX PROGRAM

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED

Memorandum 9/21/71, of same caption, from Mr. Cotter

to Mr. Miller contained recommendation #3, approved by the Director,

that Office of Legal Counsel examine legal bases for security investigations

of the emergency detention type to determine whether repeal of the

Emergency Detention Act (assuming repeal act will be signed by the

President) will restrict legal basis for FBI investigation of subversives.

Our conclusion is that repeal of the Emergency Detention

sician

Act will in no way interfere with FBI investigation of subversion in its

many forms. The effect of the repeal is to outlaw only, summary apprehension

ana/detention of persons alleged to be subversive and hence dangerous in a

time of national emergency.. The FBI did not obtain its basic investigative

authority from any provision of the Emergency Detention Act and does not

(lose that authority by repeal.

Our basic investigative authority for this type of case is in the

Presidential directive of September 6, 1939, which still remains in effect,

with updatings. In addition to that there is a host of criminal statutes •

which are particularly applicable to the type of action-oriented subversives

with whom we now deal. The principal subversives now carry guns, rob

banks to get money, steal arms and ammunition, commit arson, set off

bombs, incite riots, and do many other things which violate one or more

criminal statutes over which this Bureau has investigative jurisdiction.

From a combination of those statutes, plus the original Presidential directive.

on internal security, we have wide investigative authority.

## Page 56

Memorandum to Mr. Tolson

Re: EMERGENCY DETENTION ACT REPEAL

It also is our opinion that elimination of the Emergency

Detention Act does not prevent this Bureau from carrying in its files

an assessment of each principal subversive which would be sufficient

to mark him for Government attention should a need arise in a national

emergency.

Bearing in mind that the Emergency Detention Act could as

easily be put back in force should an emergency convince Congress of its

need,

this Bureau would then be expected to have on hand the necessary

action information pertaining to individuals. Investigations under the

Emergency Detention Act call for persons subject to possible summary

apprehension and detention to be listed under Priority 1 and Priority 2.

In lieu of that standard, we would suggest one called Estimated Violence-

Potential (EVP)" which could be further subdivided by the numbers one,

two and three. The Estimated Violence Potential would be arrived at

from investigation and would be an estimated potential for sabotage;

kidnaping or assassination of public officers; destruction, robbery, or

theft of Government property; riot; etc. Factors entering into the judgment

would ba such matters as criminal offenses which the person is known

or reasonably believed to have committed or planned; statements of

violence planned, intended or advocated against piblic officials or other-

wise; membership in, or affiliation with, organizations advocating forcible

overthrow of, or damage to, the Government; travel performed in furtherance

of any violent activity or objective; possession of firearms or other weapons

of destruction, etc.

In spite of firm belief that the Bureau has adequate investigative

leeway remaining to us, we strongly suggest that upon official repeal of the

Emergency Detention Act, a letter should be written to the Attorney General

in which this Bureau asks for a reassessment of our/investigative and

record-keeping authority concerning subversive matters. It world be

foolish of us to continue investigation without first building a record to

show that we have sought the advice of the Department in every important

particular. This is good management in general and it will also tend to

protect us against the anticipated challenge from some spokesmen of the extreme

left in which it is claimed that repeal of the Emergency Detention Act does,

in fact, eliminate our investigative authority. Such a claim logically is

to be expected and we should at least be in a position to say that this question

has been raised to the Department of Justice.

Director, FBI

EMERGENCY DETENTION PROGRAM

In view of the fact the President has signed the Act

repealing Iitle II of the Internal Security Act of 1950,

which was commonly referred to as

the Emergency Detention Act

of 1950, your views are being solicited concerning FBI

authority to continue investigations of subversive activity .

covered, in part, by this Act.

We have discontinued all planning for energency

apprehension and detention of those subjects listed in the

Security Index, which is a list of individuals whose histories

show they might engage in or conspire to engage in acts of

espionage ui saiotage during a national emergency. We have.

lIkewise discontinued operation of the Security Index, which

was an integral part of implementation of emergency apprehension.

In addition to statutory authority provided in the

Smith Act of 1940, Iitle I of the Internal Security Act of 1950,

the Communist Control Act of 1954, and statutes relating to

espionage, sabotage, rebellion and insurrection, sedition and

seditious conspiracy, we feel that authority for the FBI to

conduct investigations of subversive activity and related activity

is clearly set forth in certain Presidential Directives. For

example, on June 26, 1939, the President issued a confidential

Directive to the heads of various Government Departnents which

stated:

"It is my desire that the investigation of all espionage,

and sabotage matters be controlled and handled by the Federal

Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice...."

September 6, 1939, the President issued a Directive as follows:

"The Attorney General has been requested by me to instruct the

Federal Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice

to take charge of investigative matters relating to espionage,

sabotage, subversive activities and violations of neutrality

regulations."

This Directive also pointed out that "the inves-

Ligations" (by the FBI)'must be conducted in a comprehensive and

effective manner, on a national basis, and all information

The Attorney General

On January S, 1943, the President issued a Directive

reiterating his previous Directive of September 6, 1939, and

subsequently on July 24, 1950, the President issued a third

Directive, reiterating previous Directives of September 6, 1939,

and January 8, 1943, and broadened the scope of investigative

activity by the

to include "subversive activities ana

related matters" as well as the specific matters involving

On December 15, 1953, the President

issued a statement in which he set forth the language containea

in the combined Presidential Directives dated September 6,

1939, January 8, 1943, and July 24, 1950, concerning the

investigative sesponsibility of the FBI in matters relating to

"espionage, sabotage, subversive activities and related matters."

The statement then pointed out the FBI is also charged with

investigating all violations of the Atonic Energy Act and

requested cooperation of all enforcement officers, as in the

previous Directives, in reporting all information

relating to

violations of the Atomic Energy Act to the nearest representative

of the FBI.

Based on interpretation of exigting statutes aná the

language set forth in the various Presidential Directives cited

above, we feel that the repeal of the Emergency Detention Acc

of 1950 has not eroded the FBI's authority and responsibility

to conduct investigation of subversive activities

and related

matters. Likewise, we

feel that the repeal of this Act does

limit the FBI's authority and responsibility to keep and maintain

administrative records, including various indices, which may be

necessary in fulfilling such responsibility and authority.

I strongly feel that irrespective of the repeal of the

Emergency Detention Act, the Federal Government must take

whatever steps are necessary, within the law, to protect itself

from all hostile forces bent on its destruction.

We, therefore,

feel that it is absolutely incumbent upon the FBI to continue

Investigations of those who pose a threat to the internal securit

of the country and to maintain an administrative index of such

individuals as an essential part of our investigative

responsibility. Such an index not only enables the FBI to pin-

point individuals who have exhibited a propensity to conduct acis

inimical to national security, but also serves as an extremely

valuable list of individuals who pose a continuing threat to the

safety of the President and thereby enables us to provice current

data to U. S. Secret Service conceming backgrounds and where-

abouts of such individuals.

RE:

SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS

DETAILS:

Subsequent to the repeal of the Emergency Detention

Act (EDA) the field was instructed to make no recommendations

for additions to, deletions from, or other changes to the

Security Index.

EDA would limit our authority to conduct investigations of

those who pose a threat to the internal security of the country

and to maintain an administrative index of such individuals as

an essential part of our investigative responsibilities.

The Department has advised that the Bureau's authority

to investigate violations of the espionage, sabotage, Smith

Act,

Atomic Energy Act, and related

statutes, as well

as subversive

activities and related

matters

in accordance with Bureau

statutory responsibilities and the Presidential Directives,

remains unaffected.

The Department further

advised that the

repeal of the EDA does not prohibit the Bureau from compiling

and maintaining an administrative index to

assist in making

reauily reiiievabie

available the resulis of our invosti-

gations into subversive

activities and related matters.

Therefore,

we propose

setting up

an administrative index

which we will refer to as the AdEX.

It will contain four

categories which

represent the degree of dangerousness

a subject

represents toward the internal security of the country.

A careful analysis has

been made of various categories

of security cases handled in the Domestic Intelligence Division,

for inclusion

in the Security Index (SI)

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

RE: SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS

Our study leads us to believe that the old SI, broken

down into Priorities I, II, and III in line with a theoretical

concept of arresting the most dangerous subversives first, should

be restructured.

Instead of listing individuals in priority of

arrest, we feel that the list should be set up to signify the

overall

threat or potential threat to the national security.

Thus, instead of Priority I, we propose Category I which will

those whom the Bureau should keep under

constant investiga-

tion due to their proclivity for violence and danger to the Nation.

Instead of Priority II we would have Category II listing those

whom we should check on at least twice a year. Category III

would be those whom we check on at least once each year and

Category IV would be those whose residence and employment

should be verified at least annually.

It is believed, for example, that in old Priority I too

much emphasis was placed

on leadership capacity and organizational

affiliation. The new Category I

will consist not only of those

in leadership capacity and organizational affiliation but any

individual who has deminstiated thiough aots or statomonts that

he represents a constant danger to the national security and

therefore should be under constant investigation.

For this

reason, the new Category I will list more

individuals than the

old Priority I.

Likewise Category II, which will require a minimum of

semiannual verification of employment and residence addresses,

will

also list individuals not in a leadership capacity who

have adequately demonstrated they are actively participating in

movements with which

to

the national defense or are likely to furnish financial

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

RE: SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS

Based on our best analytical efforts, we believe that

adoption of the four-category administrative index as described

above will result in an increased

case load

in the field.

It is

believed that the total number of our overall security cases in

office of origin and auxiliary offices will increase by more than

23,000 cases during the coming year.

between 17,000 and 18,000 individuals, virtually all of whom are

either now

being investigated or who have been investigaied in the

It is also pointed out most of the increased case load will

involve a moderate

amount of investigative activity by our Agents

and will not be an investigative burden on the field as may be

implied by the estimated increase in case load.

We believe that the increased case load can readily

be handled by utilizing currently available manpower since all

we are doing in the cases falling within the estimated increases

is verifying residences and employments. All time-consuming.

background investigation has previously been

completed in these

cases.

Our standards for inclusion in the ADEX will allow

us much greater leeway as to the individuals to be included.

The standards

are tailored to fit our own needs and Bureau

Headquarters will make the final decision

as tò

those to be

included.

Change from

the old Security Index to the new

administrative index will require some changes in automatic

aa processing Procedures

ALL IRFORMATION

CONTAINED.

PALM RI

T. J. Smith to Mr. E. S. Miller memorandum dated 8/11/72,

captioned "Fiscal Year 1974 Budget Policy Guidance," referred

to the fact that

we have been conducting a seven-month's analysis

win de indee i'm

we of the, Bureau:s

Administrative.Index:(ADEX):.and that at appears...

that by implementing certain streamlining measures and altering

requirements for reporting

and periodic verification of informa-

tion, some manpower might be available for

reassignment to one

of the other critical areas of oux work. In this

connection the

same memorandum pointed

out that the Domestic Intelligence Division

has an urgent need for in excess

of 500 Special Agents to handle

several areas of national security work which are not receiving

attention deserved.

BACKOROUNE

By way of background, the ADEX is an outgrowth of the old

security Index program which in itself was

an integral

part of

the Emergency Detention Program.

The Emergency Detention Program

in latter years derived its

authority from Title II of the Internal

Security Act of 1950 (better known as the Emergency Detention

Act) .

-"".

•In the Fall of 1971 the Emergency Detention. Act was repealed by

='

Congress and we, of course, immediately discontinued the Emergency

Detention Program.

Since

the security Index was in actuality

an extension of an integral part of the Emergency Detention

Program, it was believed that the Security Index as it was

structured should also be discontinued

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re :

Administrative Index

Streamlining Measures

that the Government might have to defend itself from attack and

that it would be

necessary at such time to quickly identify

persons who were a threat to the national

security so that

investigation could be intensified and if necessary the President

could go to a joint session of Congress

and ask fox

emergency

legislation

permitting apprehension and

detention of persons

who threaten

existence of the Government.

The Department advised after consultation that the FBI's

authority to investigate individuals engaged in subversive

activity had not been eroded by repeal of the Emergency Detention

Act, and that further repeal of this

Act did not in any way

prohibit the FBI from maintaining an

administrative index of

individuals who were under investigation for subversive activity.

Accordingly, we devised the Administrative Index for the

purpose

vi being able to quickiy ideniiiy peisons represeniing d intedi

to the

national security.

Since we already had the identities

of such persons contained in the Security Index, we used the

Security Index as a basis for setting up the Administrative Index.

The major difference,

of course, was that whereas persons listed

in Security Index had been listed with

a view of possible

apprehension and detention, the persons being listed in ADEX

would

not be subject to detention, but would be listed for ready

identification purposes.

......

..since persons listed.in ADEX. would not be subject. to:."

apprehension

and detention, the

requirement for Departmental

concurrence in listing no longer existed. Also, since the

detention factor was no longer

listed irrespoctive of dogree

a major issue, persons could be

of threat they may represent to

the national security.

Re:

Administrative Index

Streamlining Measures

ASSESSMENT OF 'ADEX

ADEX has now been in operation about 8 months and we

have had a chance to evaluate its operation and effectiveness.

Based

on discussions with field

personnel as well as

our own

observations, we believe that several major changes should be

made at this

time.

(1) While ADEX has not been intended as an investigative

program,

it is somewhat of an extension of security Index which

was an integral part of an investigative program, and there are

vestiges of the investigative program

apparent in our operation

Of ADEX. ADEX must be clearly separated from investigative

criteria and policy so that it represents a mere by-product or

administrative supplement to our investigations and not as a

guideline or controlling factor in the investigation itself.

The very nature of the critoria for inclusion of individuals in

not the gated son

are such to generate investigative activity which

may not

be necessary were it not for ADEX. Reporting procedures for a

great bulk of our security cases

are based on the category of

ADEX or the fact that the subject is listed in AdEX.

A great

deal of investigative

activity is created because of the requirement

of periodic verification of residence and

employment addresses.

In other words, existence of ADEX creates investigative and

reporting activity which might not be necessary otherwise.

•.,. (?.)

particularly

from

tts belleved that Abel Is needlessly complex, .:

the standpoint

of criteria for inclusion

of an individual in the ADEX, and is administratively cumbersome.

conditions existing today, particularly with respect to emphasis

on invasion of/privacy.and Other First and Fourth Amendment

Micrights. the current criteria for designating. individuals. for ADEX

Re:

Administrative Index

Streamlining Measures

believed that such broad terminology would leave us in a vulner-

able position if our guidelines were to be scrutinized by

interested Congressional committees, which has been threatened.

PROPOSED NEW ADEX CRITERIA

If for no other reason

but practicality,

it is believed

that ADEX should be a list of individuals who realistically represent

an immediate threat to the national

seucrity, as opposed to

individuals who might theoretically pose a threat in the future

under a given set of circumstances.

We recognize that anyone

who has

embraced a philosophy that includes an overthrow of the

American

form of government is a potential enemy of the Government.

However, in many such instances, an individual may believe in some

other form of

government but would be unwilling to engage in

activity more

violent than philosophical discussions.

On the other side of the coin is an individuai who not

only embraces the philosophy of overthrow of the Government, but is

actually engaged in some form of activity designed to bring

about

that overthrow by force or violence or other unconstitutional means.

It is this latter individual who would seize upon any type of

national emergency to exploit a weakness in Governmental functions

in an effort to wrest control, or who would commit violent acts

such

as bombings of public buildings which are symbolic of our

national institutions; ambush killings of police officers who

are the visible symbol of our democratic system; attack water.

supplies, power systems;

or transportation" facilities in 'an"

effort to create a chaotic void into which a revolutionary force

might be able to supplant the Government. This is the type of

individual who should be listed in the AdEX.

It is therefore proposed that the existing ADEX with four

categories. representing-an unrealistic.concept.of individuals

...constituting athreat tothe national security.be.revised-so..thaty.

Re:

Streamlining Measures

To do this the criteria would be changed to

read as

follows:

"ADEX should be limited to those individuals whose

actions or statements have clearly established that they represent

current threat to the national

security.

"Included are individuals, whether affiliated with organ-

ized groups of not, who have shown a willingness and capability

for engaging in treason, rebellion or insurrection, seditious

conspiracy,

sabotage, espionage, terrorism, guerrilla warfare,

assassination of Government officials or leaders, or other such

acts which would result in interference with or a threat to the

survival and effective operation of national, state, or local

government.

"The toregoing wouid include leader uf viganizations

whose aims include the overthrow or destruction of the United States

government of any State, Territory, district,

or possession

thereof, or the government of

any political subdivision therein,

by unlawful means.

Individuals affiliated with such organizations

who have demonstrated a willingness and capability of activity

set forth under criteria set forth above would be included, but

mere membership in

organization is not sufficient to

justify

inclusion in ADEX.

'"Individuals. should be considered a

current threat': to

the national security when

reliable information has been

developed that they have engaged in activity falling within

the above-described criteria during the past two years

and

there is no indication that they have given up or ceased to

Re:

Streamlining Measures

Such a list would also be advantageous in quickly

identifying extremists, who though not posing a threat to the

national security, do seek to deny constitutional rights of

others, or are white or black chauvinists or nationalists who

on race hatreds and ethnic discord.

We will also

propose that a counterpart to the "Communist Index" be established

to be known as the "Extremist Index."

Neither of these indexes

will constitute

a program but will merely be a listing which will

be computerized for ready retrieval at any time we need to quickly

identify persons of this type who were involved in activity inimical

to the national interest.

Details concerning these indexes will

be included in the separate proposal.

MANPOWER SAVINGS

It is difficult if not impossible to estimate a manpower

savings as resuit vi ituefluing ADEX and streamlining iis operation.

However, based on the premise

that the revised ADEX

would contain

primarily what is now Categories I & II, this would mean that about

10,473 individuals would be dropped. If chese remained on ADEX,

this many cases would be opened during a twelve-month period due

to necessity to verify employment and residence addresses

and to

report any pertinent data developed to date.

These cases would be

in a closed status in the field and would be reopened on a

regular staggered basis.

….:.A Canvass of ten: field

offices including New York,

Newark, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Milwaukee,

Minneapolis, San Francisco,

Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia resulted in an estimate

that roughly 89% of the above-described total of 10,473 cases

would be affected. These offices could not give any realistic

Re:

It is important to note that there will be no immediate

review

Of ADEX cases will not be completed for at least 12 months.

To avoid creating a sudden increase in workload in thé field,

instructions are being issued to review existing ADEX cases

as they

would normally come up on tickler during the next 12 months under

the old ADEX rules. In this manner all cases now listed in ADEX

Revisions will

be made in Manual of Instructions and submitted separately.

(2) If proposed revision is approved, investigative

"In reviewing existing criteria, it is believed that

essentially those individuals who are presently in Categories I

and II would

meet the

test of being dangerous now, but that

most, if noü all,

of those in Categories III and IV would not.

It is further believed that ADEX

should not be broken into

separate categories, but should be a single, seloctive listing.

It is also felt that ADEX should be strictly a by-product of our

investigative activity and not in and of itself generate any

investigation or govern reporting procedures.

"Accordingly, the following revisions with respect

to ADEX are being placed in effect immediately:

"Rovised Criteria

"Only the following individuals should be included

in ADEX:

"Individuals, whether affiliated with organized

groups or

not. who have shown a willingnoss and capability of

ongaging in treason, rebellion or insurrection, seditious

conspiracy, sabotage, espionage, terrorism, guerrilla warfare,

assassinacion of Government officials or leaders, or other

such

acts which would result in interference with

0s a threat

to the

survival and effective operation of national, state or

local government.

"This would include leaders of organizations whose

aims include the overthion or destruction of the United States

or the

government of any State, Territory, district, or

possession thereof, or the govornnent of

any political sub-

division therein, by unlawful means. Mere membership in such

organizations is not sufficient in itself to warrant inclusion

"The term

'leaders' denotes those individuals,

irrespoctive of title, who are in a position to significantly

influence the policies or direct the activities of the group.

"Individuals should be considered 'dangerous now' to

the national

security when reliable information has been received

that they have engaged in activity falling within the above-

described

criteria during the past two years and there is no

indication

they have given up or ceased to engage in such activity.

"There may ba some instances where retention of an

individual in ADEX is justified

even though no specific information

available during the prior

two years.

for example,

such

retention would be warranted in the case

of individuals who have

gono into hiding, loft the country, have been imprisoned, or

similar circumstances and there is no rollable information

available indicating

that they have renounced activities covered

in the above criteria.

"Dotermination of Eligibility for ADEX Inclusion

"The Bureau recognizes that anyone who has embraced a

philosophy that includes advocacy of the overthrow of our form

0f

government is a potential enemy.

However, in many instances

an individual may believe in some other form of government or

oven in the overthrow of our form of government, but without a

willingness or capability of engaging in activity other than a

philosophical discussion

Such persons subscribe to

au alien philosuphy, but their accivitios save not gone ssyond

an ideological stage.

This would include attendance at meetings,

taking part in theoretical discussions or other activity which

stops short of advocating or engaging in action to overthrow

the United States.

"Examples might be members of the Communist Party, USA,

or the Socialist Workers Party, or other old-line revolutionary

groups which

basically advocate an overthrow of our present form

of government, but where the subject's activity has been

ideological in nature and not oriented towards action.

In this

connection, however, each case must be reviewed on its individual

morits, since the willingness and capability of individuals to

engage

in action dangerous to the national security is the

primary factor in making a determination for the inclusion in AdEX.

"Under normal circumstances members of such hate

the Ku Klux Klan would not meet the criteria for

inclusion

in ADEX.

There could be exceptions, however,

and each

case must be examined individually to determine if

it meets

the new

criteria.

These criteria

can apply to

involved

with extreme right as well as extreme left

organizations, or to individuals who have no affiliation

organized groups but who are anarchists and are

engaged

in attempts to destroy the United States.

The following is set forth to answer the inquiry of the Acting

Director concerning the attached memorandum from Assistant Attorney General

Henry E. Petersen dated 6/6/73, captioned "Presidential Emergency Action

Document No. 5 (PEAD 5)," and classified "Secret."

PEAD 5, classified "Secret," provides for the apprehension

and detention and disposition (including deportation) of enemy aliens during

periods of national emergency. PEAD 5 is based on Title 50, u.s.C.,

Section 21, under which the President is empowered to issue a Presidential

proclamation that war has been declared or a hostile invasion or predatory

incursion is to be attempted, or is threatened against U.S. territories.

Following such proclamation, the Attorney General would be authorized by

that statute to set into motion measures necessary to effect control of enemy

aliens.

tinue furnishing information previously requested by the Department in

(1) memorandum dated 6/21/72, regarding PEAD 5 and (2) memorandum

dated 10/26/71 regarding the Emergency Detention Program.

The 6/21/72 memorandum requested that the FBI furnish on

a regular basis a listing of aliens to be considered by the Department for

apprehension and detention when deemed dangerous to the public peace

and safety of the United States in conjunction with PEAD 5. The aliens

identified to the Department on a monthly basis are those in our Administra-

tive Index of individuals whose activities constitute a possible danger to

the national security.

The 10/26/71 memorandum requested the FBI to furnish a

monthly memorandum reflecting the identities of Government employees who

by significant acts or membership in subversive organizations have demon-

strated a propensity to commit acts inimical to national security. Identities

oi Government employees on our Administrative Index have been furnished

to the Department monthly as requested.

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re: Presidential Emergency Action

Document No. Five

The caption of the 10/26/71 memorandum "Emergency Detention

Program" refers to planning for the apprehension and detention of individuals,

both aliens and citizens, who might engage in espionage or sabotage during

times of national emergency. That planning, which included a listing of

potentially dangerous individuals, had been authorized under the Emergency

Detention Act (Title II) of the Internal Security Act of 1950, but was discon-

tinued with the repeal in September, 1971, of the Emergency Detention Act.

Thus, no plans exist currently for the apprehension and detention of citizens

considered to be dangerous in the event of national emergency, but, as noted

above, enemy aliens would be subject to restrictive measures under PEAD 5.

We will discontinue submission of the above-mentioned two lists

to the Department. Response to incoming not believed necessary since the

Department will readily note our discontinuance of submission of lists. If

either or both lists are requested again by the Department at any time in the

future, they can be compiled immediately from information maintained in our

Arministrative Index.

None. For information.

• SUBJECT:

Program for Apprehension and Detention of Persons

Considered Potentially Dangerous to the National

Defense and Public Safety oi the United States.

SECRET

Reference is made to the several memoranda and to the con-

ferences which have been held between representatives of the Bureau

and of the Department conceming the adoption of' standardsto

Security Index purposes for apprehension of individuals in an

energency.

As you are aware, final approval of the Security Index standards

which have been used by the Bureau for a number of years has been with-

held pending not only careful study of the standards themselves, but of

possible alternative stendards.: The enactment of the Internal Security

Act of 1950 which creates another standard for the enforcement oi Title Il

of the Act has further complicated final determination of standards.

As you know, Title II of the Internal Security Act declares that

when a state of Internal Security Emergeney is proclaimed by the Presi

dent, he shall, acting through the Attorney General, apprehend and detain

each person as to wom there is reasonable ground to believe that such

person probably will engage in, or probably will conspire with others.to

engage in, acts of espionage or of sabotage. While it is contemplated

that in the event of war other legislation relating to the apprehension

and detention of potentially dangerous persons will be speedily sought,

nonetheless so long as the standard provided in the Internal Security Act

of 1950 remains the guiding legislative principle for the apprehension and

detention of potentially dangerous individuals, the Department must con-

sider this standard in reviewing the files of individuals who may be.

subject to apprehension and detention.

After careful study of the application of the standards which have

been used by your Bureau in the listing of names on the security. Index list,

it is my ovinion that these standaras can be utilized by your Bureau and

by the Criminal Division in meeting the responsibilities.of.each under

the apprehension and detention program. Accordingly, I approve the stand-

In further examining our position and the basis for

apprehending dangerous individuals at the time of an emergency

you will recall that previously both orallu and in uriting, the

Departmentarasaduised that it

is not anticipated the detention

provisions of the Internal Security Aoth Aotah1950, wilt supersede

the Departnento detention program.

The Internal Security Act of 1950 became a law on

September 23, 1950. At a conference with fermer Attorney General

McGrath on the norning of sertenber i 1950, he aquised the

Director that he had received a memorandum

Bureau had been working in conjunction with the Department.

IT. McGrath aduised the Director he did not believe the passage

of the bill should in any way Interfere with the Department

program as previously outlined. In ansuer to the memorandum

referred to by the former Attorney General the Bureau received

In regard to the Attorney General's suggestion that

¡representatives of the Bureau and the criminal Division confer for

the purpose of devising the most efficient method of notification

to the Bureau as reviews are completed by the department it is

recommended that a conference be promptly arranged to work out

the procedures that will be used.

ACTION:

Is you approve, there is attached a memorandum to the

Attorney General requesting his assurance that the department's

detention progran will be used in an emergency and his advice

an to whether or not he agrees with our concept of the security

Index program and standards as outlined in Bureau memorandun to

Mr. Peyton Ford dated June 28, 1951.

If you agree, I will arrange a conference with

representatives of the Criminal Division to plan a method of

(2) The current standards we use in determining the

regarding getting approval by the department of the standares

that the Department had already given the

authority to apprehend anone on the security Inder pending

the Department's decision with regard te the standards.

Bureau representatives insisted on the Attorney General's

specific approval of the standaras under union we are operating,

inasmuch as ve are an investigative agency and the policy as

to whom should be apprehended under any detention pregram

must rest with the turInen GeneraL.

From time to time the Department, while maintaining

that the plan as set forth in the Department's Perifolio il

be used in the event or an emergency, has intimated that the

Internal security lot of 1950 cannot be ignored.

The Deparimeri

One of the purposes of Security-type investigations is to

of individuals.

wIth subversive groups, are considered dangerous or potentially

dangerous to the internal security of the country and the consequent

you must be alert at all times to evaluate each and every security

investigation to be certain the case

has been thoroughly investigated

to resolve the question of the subject's dangerousness.

To fulfill your responsibillty in connection with every

case in which a subject's name is presently on the Security Index,

you must be certain that the case

receives appropriate re-evaluation

so that at all times there is sufficient information developed to

Justify aubject's detention In the event of an emergency.

On the other hand we have a definite responsibility to

appraise cases fairly to be certain that names are either not added

to the Security Index or are deleted therefrom when individuals no

longer present a danger to the internal security of the country.

Because of the underground operations of the Communist Party and

the security measures adopted by the Party, It has become increasingly

more difficult to evaluate certain cases because of the absence oi

open Party activity.

Whenever doubts are raised for any reason as

to whether a Security Index subject is still dangerous, additional

positive, thorough and searching investigative action must be taken

to resolve the question.

In far too many instances you have failed

to take such action and

the Bureau has been forced to call individual

cases to your attention.

The Bureau desires to reiterate emphatically

that it remains your responsibility to insure that your cases are

properly evaluated and are investigated thoroughly without the

necessity of repeating this basic instruction in correspondence in

the Individual cases.

An evaluation of dangerousness to decide whether or not

a. subject's name should be added to or retained in the security

Index must be made following every interview of a security subject.

If a subject on interview denies in whole or in part pertinent

derogatory information contained in our files and there is not

Incontrovertible proof in the files that the subject 1s untruthful

resolve the matter.

In order to reaffirm the correctness

of the information previously

furnished and to determine if the individuals can recall any

additional subversive information they failed to furnish or which

I cannot emphasize too strongly the absolute necessity

The Consab ciussification indicates the subject possesses the potential

to be a saboteur

The nunder of priority arrests has increased to the point

priority subjects to each special Agent aucilable for arrasta, The

Chicago Office has recommended that authority be granted to permit

It is estimated that the above change will reduce the

number of priority subjects by over 50 per cent.

This will provide

a more selective basis for such tabbings and will permit a more

efficient handling of the arrests.

field will be done on a staggered basis, the

RECOLMENDATIONS:

1) It is recommended that there be no change in the instruction

that a special Agent be assigned to each arrest of a

security Inder subject tabbed for priority of apprehension.

2) If you approve, there is attached an SAC letter instructing

DETAILS:

Due to the large number of security Index arrests to be made

in an emergency we have a priority of apprehension program set up

so that efforts to arrest will be directed against the more dangerous

a prior t

persons first.

The priority classifications are identified as

comsas and Detcom.

The comsab classification has been set up for the purpose

of providing ready identification of those security Index subjects

who, because of special training, employment in or access to key

facilities or certain other factors, possess the potential of

saboteurs in the event of an emergency.

specifically, the Comsab

classification includes security Inder subjects who are:

(1) Employed in key facilities; (2) Veterans of military services

of any country and particularly the Abrahon Lincoln Brigade;

(3) Veterans of O.Soso (Office of Strategic Services); (4)Graduates

of the lenin school in Russia and (5) Inoun to have engaged in

acts of violence during industrial strikes and those who have

engaged in fomenting trouble among laborers in industrial plants.

The Deucom classification includes all Security Index subjecis

who are considered exceedingly dangerous and should be apprehended

prior to others in the securry Index.

specifically, it includes the

effectivenesso

This is particularly true in view of the jäct

that present instructions require that a special Agent be

assigned to the apprehencion of each security Index subject

tabbed for priority of arresta

Observation:

The larger offices are principally affected in

this matters for although they may use police officers alone

without special Agents being present to apprehend Security

Index subjects not scheduled for priority attention, a special

Agent must be assigned in the latter type of arresto The Chicago

Office has raised a question in this matter and has suggested

that authorization be granted to permit a police detective and

police officer to be assigned to arrests of subjects listed for

priority attention. This recommendation was made because that

office plans to use approximately 195 arrest teams consisting

of a special Agent and a police officer to effect the arrests of

approtimately 691 subjects tabbed for priority of apprehension.

This means three to your such subjects to each arrest team.

There are other offices in which it would be necessary to assign

as many or more priority of arrest subjects to each special Agent

available for arrest assignment.

It is believed that priority of arrest subjects should

continue to be assigned to arpesi reams in which a Special Agent

will be present because those subjects are the more dangerous

and we must be certain that every effort is made to effect their

arrests as rapidly as possible rather than permit police officers

alone to apprehend such subjects. It is believed we should re-

consider the elements upon which

All of the reasons for the Comsab and Detcom tabbings

are based on an individual's

violent tendencies, subversive

leadership or special subversive training except the Comsab

tabbing because of employment or access to key or vital facilities

tendenciess et cetera.

The fact that the subject has access

to such facilities is sufficient to warrant his prompt

apprehension.

Individuals who have been tabbed jor Comsab because

of military service alone

with no other element for the tabbing

present o different situation. this group represents a large

portion of the 11,033 persons now considered for priority of

arresto Although

the exact number is not known it

is estimated

that the number so tabbed on military service alone will rur

over so per cent of the total. although military training

in most instances indicates training in the use of firearms

other individuals who have had experience with firearms such

as hunters, et cetera, are not considered exceedingly

dangerous based on that experience alone. of course, if an

investigation has developed information concerning specific

previous training or violent tendencies indicating the subject

possesses the potential to be a saboteur the subject should be

cuinôidered under the pricrity program. It la heliened that

each case should be considered separately on the facts developed

rather than to arbitrarily list a subject for priority arrest

just because he is known to have been in the armed Services.

The recommended change in procedures to reduce the

number of security Index subjects to be afforded priority

of arrest will not weaken our program. It will permit prompt

and more effective efforts by special Agent personnel to arrest

the more dangerous persons due to the reduction in the number

of.priority.arrest.assignmentso

The attached SAl Letter instructs field offices with

a relatively small number of COMSAB subjects

to review the

files at this time and submit a form Fa-122 to change tabbing

when necessary.

Larger offices may review the files at the

time of the next verification of addresses

reviews are to be completed by June 15, 1955.

(K) SECURINY INDEX - COMSAR TARRING -- The Comsab classification

has been se up within the priority apprehension program for the

purpose of providing ready identification of those security Index

subjects who, because of special training, employment or past acts

of violence, possess the potential of saboteurs in the event of a

national emergency. The fact that the Security Index card for a

subject has been tabbed Comsab is one of the reasons the subject is

also tabbed Detcom to indicate the subject should be apprehended

bed.

has

been a corresponding Increase in the number of subjects designated

for priority of apprehension.

Under present instructions in Section 87C of the Manual of

Instructions, one of the reasons for the Comsab tabbing is when a

Security Index subject is a veteran of the military services of any

country and particularly the Abraham

Lincoln Brigade.

Henceforth,

you should continue to tab for Comsab all veterans of the Abraham

Lincoln Brigade.

Veterans of the military services of any country

are no longer to be tabbed Comsab based on military

service alone.

However, you should be certain all subjects of Security

Index sards are considered undor the Comsab progran whon the investi

gations have developed information concerning specific previous

training or violent tendencies indicating the subjects

possess the

potential to be saboteurs.

In that connection each case must be

considered on the facts developed in the particular case.

The above amends the instruction relating to the basis for

considering a subject under the Comsab program because of military

service.

There are no changes in the other reasons for considering

the Comsab classification as outlined in the Manual of Instructions.

In order to adjust the Security Index cards tabbed Comsab

in your office in accordance with the above instructions it will be

necessary to review each case so tabbed in order to delete the tab-

bings. when based on military service alone. Form FD-122 should be

submitted to the Bureau to delete any

change necessary.

Offices with

a relatively small number of Security Index cards tabbed Comsab should

review each case

file for such subjects at this time. Offices with

a large number of cards so tabbed may desire to review the case files

at the time the residence addresses and places of employment are

verified during the next six months. As soch as the reviews have been

WASHINGTON 23,

(A) SECURITY INDEX ~ Due to the present grave and tense inter-

national situation I am deeply concerned over our Security Index

Program which in time of national emergency represents the Nation's

most powerful weapon in combating espionage, sabotage and insur

rection by preventing dangerous or potentially dangerous individuals

from remaining at liberty.

I want you to know that the Attorney General has advised

me that he does not have the funds or manpower to review the Security

Index cases but that in an emergency he will direct that all persons

whose names are then included in the Security Index be promptly

apprehended. Therefore,

the Bureau for all intents and purposes 1s

responsible

for the listing of all names included in the Security

Index and for the arrests which will follow at the time of an emer-

gency.

We must be certain at all times that the listing of every

name in the Security Index is supported

and justified by sufficient

internation concerning subversive aotivitios or revolutionary.

tendencies developed during thorough

investigations to establish

grounds for detention in the event of a national crisis.

The failure to have the names of all dangerous or poten-

tially dangerous individuals in the Security Index at the time of

an emergency means we have not fulfilled our responsibilities in

the security field and we will not be in a position to prevent

sabotage, espionage, sedition, insurrection and strikes or slowdowns

directed

by subversive elements,

On the other hand it is essential

that only dangerous or potentially dangerous individuals are listed

for apprehension in an emergency.

In that connection I want to emphasize to you again the

absolute necessity for bringing all pending security cases to a

logical conclusion where

investigation reinains to be conducted be-

fore a determination can be made regarding inclusion in the Security

Index.

In view of the importance of this matter I am holding

each Special Agent in Charge personally responsible for each Security

Index listing in his office to be certain that each listing is based

on sound grounds.

The following instructions shall be placed into effect

Immediately:

the inclusion of each name for the Security Index and the removal

of any name from the Security. Index, except in those offices having

more than 1,000 Security Index subjects in wnich instances the

recommendations must be made personally by the Special Agent in

Charge, Assistant Special Agent in Charge or Bureau-approved Security

Supervisor.

2. An Immediate review of the case file on each individual

whose name is presently included in the Security Index shall be

made at this time.

Although the recomnendations for inclusion of

the names that are in the Security Index at this time have emanated

from your office in most instances and under present requirements

these cases are reviewed in connection with the preparation of annual

supplemental investigative reports during which reviews you have

been specifically instructed to evaluate each case to be certain

the Security Index card is warranted, I am initiating this compre-

hensive review at this time to make absolutely certain that all

factors in every case have been thoroughly considered by you to

determine if the cases remain sound.'

Each Special Agent' In Charge shall personally approve or

disapprove the retention of the names of all subjects In the Security

(A) SECURITY INDEX,--IT TIEW of recent developments in the inter

national situation it has become necessary to re-evaluate the priority

if arrest features of our Security Index Program.

At the present

includes subjects who are tabbed Comsab,

Security Index tabbed Detcom will be arrested first in the event

(In the event of an all-out emergency all

subjects whose names are included in the Security, Index will be con-

sidered for Immediate apprehension.):

In order that the most dangerous persons will be ap

prehended

during a limited but:grave emergency, there are set forth

below the new standards to be used in deciding who should be listed

for priority of apprehension and Detcom tabbing.

1.. The Comsab tabbing 18 to be discontinued,

or members. of any basic revolutionary organization when

there 1s evidence of one or more of the following:

(2)

Experience as picket captains, strong-arm men

or active participation in violent strikes, riots

or demonstrations..

c. Persons active in the Communist Party underground.

d. Any other security Index subject whose activities, past

or present, regardless of membership in a revolutionary

organization, clearly and unmistakably depict the

individual as a potential saboteur, espionage agent

or disruptionist in the event of an emergency.

Subjects who will be tabbed Detcom should comprise a

hardcore of subversives. Each individual case should stand on its

own and the decision to consider a

subject for priority of appre-

hension should be based on the subject's subversive activities and

revolutionary tendencies. Employment in a key or vital facility

will no longer. be a reason alone for Detcom tabbing.

In evaluating each Security Index case 1t will be neces-

submitting your personal recommendation for retaining a subject

in the Security Index you should also submit your recommendation

regarding the Detcom tabbing as indicated above along with your

reasons why the subject meets. the new Detcom standards in sufficient

detail to justify your recommendation. If a subject is tabbed

Detcom

comsab at this time and you are not recommending the

tabbing in accordance with the above instructions you should

submit a Form FD-122 attached to your Security Index recommendation

in order. to delete the Detcom and Comsab tabbings. If you are recom-

mending the Detcom tabbing in accordance

with the above instructions

and the subject is already tabbed Detcom, you should so advise the

Bureau and Form FD-122 need not be submitted. In instances in

which you are recommending the Detcom tabbing

and the subject is

already tabbed Detcom and Comsab you should attach a Form FD-122

in order that the Comsab tabbing can be deleted. Of course, if the

subject is not already tabbed Detcom and you are recommending such

tabbing under the new instructions, you should at-ach a Form FD-122

to your Security Index recommendation in order that the Detcom

tabbing can be added to the Security Index card.

There will be instances in which you have already sub-

mitted your recommendations that a Security Index subject

should be

retained in the Security Index.

In those instances it will be neces- .

sary for you to recheck the individual case files to determine whether

a Detcom tabbing is necessary and to advise the Bureau in accordance

6. I want you to discuss this matter fully with both Agent

and Supervisory personnel and point out to them the vital

necessity of studying the Security Index cases critically.

and objectively.

Application of the new criteria to your

cases will undoubtedly result in substantial reduction in

the Security Index throughout the field.

Under the Security Index review project, each case must

be analyzed as 1t stands.

Do not request authority to inter-

view or any other action of the Bureau in the memoranda

submitted in the review project. Interviews already authorized

should be conducted and the

results considered under the

review project, but they must not delay submission of

recommendations

regarding Security Index status by the dead-

line date.,

B. Security Index Criteria

• Effective at once, the addition to and retention or names

in the Security Index shall

be governed by the following criteria:

1. No name shail be added to or retained in the Security

Index unless one or more of the following situations has

been established through investigation:

(a.) Subject has had membership or participation in the

activities of a basic revolutionary organization within

the last 5 years as

shown by overt acts or statements

"established through reltable sources, informants, or

individuals.

the opportunity presented by a national emergency to

endanger the public safety as shown by overt acts

or statements within the last 3 years established through

reliable sources, informants, or individuals.

(d.) Although investigation has failed to establish overt

acts or statements on the part of a subject. within the

time limits set out above, facts have been developed which

clearly and unmistakably depict the subject as a dangerous

individual who could be expected to commit acts inimical

to the national defense and public safety of the United

States

in time of

emergency

•2.

In evaluating interviews insofar as Security Index status

is concerned you should be guided as. follows:

(a.) Whenever a subject of a security investigation by

a positive statement to interviewing Agents clearly

indicates a continued adherence to the doctrines, aims

or purposes of a revolutionary organization or a front

organization, the positive statement shall be considered

an overt act

on the part of the subject in establishing

continued adherence.

(bo): Other than as indicated above, interviews with

Security Index subjects or potential Security Index

subjects

are not to be considered as factors requiring

the

placing or retaining of names of persons on the

Security Index; for example, lack of cooperation or

partial cooperation are not

to be regarded as such

factors.

With regard to the new criteria, I want to make it exceed-

ingly clear that item 1, (d), above, must be given strict inter-

• pretation. It is not to be construed as a "catchall" for cases not

otherwise meeting Security. Index standards, and there must be over-

whelming evidence to support any Security Index case. predicated

upon the terms of item l. (d).

Further,

during the Security Index

review and on a continuing basis thereafter any

recommendation for

retention in or addition to the Security Index based upon item 1.

(a) must note specifically those factors which bring the individual

cases within its provisions.

The revised criteria

are more stringent than those

previously in ellect, introducing specilic time Limits insolai

revised criteria will undoubtedly result in the removal of great

numbers of subjects from the security Index. In many cases

They remain potential threats and in case of

an all-

out emergency, their identities should be readily accessible to

¡permit restudy of their cases.

It has been suggested that procedure be devised whereby

the field may keep track of these subjects.

Two possible methods

may be considered: (1) By permitting the field to retain under

appropriate security the cancellea Security Index cards of these

subjects removed purely on the basis of application of the new

criteria or (2) forwarding to the field the respective Security

The field was

instruoted to mark "CANCELLED" on each such card.

The field has two security Index cards - one is in all cases

(1) The principal purpose of the procedure is to retain aùminiouruiivo

control over the identities of the cases and for that reason it was felt

that the cancelled Alphabetical Section cards were sufficient; (2) We

sought to avoid the possibility, however slight, of the use of the

cancelled cards during the stress of extreme emergency, it being noted

that the active cards with descriptive dato will actually be handed to

Agents to make arrests and (3) as times passes, the descriptive data

on the reverse sides of the cards (as of the date of cancellation) willl

become outdated. Some of the descriptive items are subject to change,

such as directions to residences and normal changes in physical

Newark ánd san Francisco Offices have suggested that the

rederiptive material on the reverse sides of the cancelled Security

Index cards (those previously filed in the Geographical, Special ot

Re:

OBSERVATIONS:

The Department is not aware of our reasons for keeping the

names of imprisoned subjects on the sI nor the manner in which such

cases are handled administratively. We, of course, recognize that

these individuals constitute no potential danger as long as they are

incarcerated. The fact of imprisonment, while it makes it temporarily

physically impossible for the individual to do harm, has no bearing

on his subversive of revolutionary beliefs and he remains a person

who will be dangerous to the security of the country upon release.

Therefore, we feel that our present practice of retaining their names

on the Index in the Unavailable section is preferable to deleting

their names entirely from the sI and subsequently reconsidering the

cases after their release, which could conceivably cause delay in

"prompt apprehension of a dangerous indiviauai üi lit iime of on

HERESY IS UNCLASSIFIED

DATE 0-12200 BYLP2ALM/RU

Upon completion of the security Index review in october,

we nad approximately 12,810 names included in the security

Index (SI).

Today there are 12,921 names included therein. The li.

initial review was deemed essential to insure that all cases were

sound as the Department had advised it was unable to review these cases,

thus leaving the [BI, in effect, the sole juage as to who was to be

included in the sI.

Consideration was also given to the fact that in

excess of 98, of these indivicuals are citizens of the United states.

Specific criteria were established at the inception of the review as

guidelines to be utilized in determining a subject's potential

dangerousness.

These criteria continue to be usea as guideiines in

connection with additions to, retention in and deletions from the st.

tangoos

Every sI case is subjecten tra percotrutiüe review in tre

Ture Control Section not only upon receipt of periodic renorts

required in these cases but in each instance that a case comes up for

review on tickler or otherwise.

In connection therewith, our basic

objective is to insure that we have included therein those individuals

who would constitute a potential threat. in time of emergency and eaci

review of a security case is approached from this stanapoint. Our.

criteria are sufficiently elastic to permit the retention of an indi-

vidual's name in the sI when facts developed depict him as a dangerous -

individual even though evidence is lacking of membership and activity

this fact in mind in every instance.

He do not take steps to remove a name from the sI immediately

upon determining that he is no longer a member of a prescribed organi-

left-wing of the right wing of the Communist Party (CP) have publicly

severed connection with the Party; nowever, many of these individuals

Re:

SECURITY INDEX

• .

Interviews with

security subjects are taken into consideration

in connection with these reviews; for example, a positive statement to

interviewing Agents indicating continued adherence to aims and

purposes of a revolutionary organization is considered an overt act

within the sI criteria. A negative interview in and of itself is

not considered an overt act for placing or retaining a name in the

SI in the absence of other specific facis indicating such action.

However, refusal to cooperate is certainly taken into consideration

along with other facts in arriving at o determination of the dangerous

ness of an individual.

As an example of the importance we attach to the sI program

and the thoroughness with which we approach this problem, each recom

mendation for addition to the sI is thoroughly analyzed on three

Re:

OBSERVATIONS:

In connection with the sI and application of the sI criteria.

thereto, these criteria are practical and workable provided they are

not

accepted blindly.

The fact that we adhere to the basic

principle, namely, is this person potentially dangerous in the event

of an emergency, is clearly reflected by the fact that we repeatedly

deny requests from the field to remove people from the Index. We are

able to do this by liberal interpretation and application of

criterion number (4) which places weight on the past activities of

a subject and his potential threat arising as a result of such past

activities.

ACTION:

We will continue to affora the SI cases careful attention

and will continue to critically analyze each such case with respect

to addition to, retention in of deletion from the sI. our plans for

During Domestic inteligence Division Inspection the Subverstive».

Control Section was found to have excessive administrative overhead due to the amount

of supervisory time being spent in administrative type functions compared to actual

supervision of investigative matters. One of the factors contributing to this condition

was the review of each field recommendation concerning additions to the Security Index

on 4 levels in the Section whereas 3 levels would be sufficient and, in fact, record ap- /

proval existed for review on only 3 levels in the ordinary cases ten

The attached memorandum from the Domestic Intelligence Division sets

forth the present handling of recommendations for inclusion in, continuance on, or

deletion from the Security Index. Included therein is the procedure now being followed

of having all field recommendations for additions to the Security Index approved by the

SOG Supervisor on the substantive desk, his Supervisor in Charge, and on the Section

Chief level. Prior to the inspection there was an unnecessary intermediate level

between the Supervisor in Charge and the Section Chief wherein one person also passed

on all such recommendations for coordination purposes whereas coordination on Section

Chief level would have beën adequate.

action is warranted, the recommendations are forwarded to the Branch Chief, Assistant

Bulet of 10/2/58 issued instructions to the field with

Index is designed to represent a list of individuals who should,

in

the light of ever-changing conditions, be continually borne in mind

with a view toward possible investigation under the security Index (SI)

program.

In connection with this program, we instructed the field to

submit certain stutistics on a quarterly hasis. Reports from.all

offices are in and tangible results obtained to date fon the above

program are as follows:

1) The names of 11 individuals have been added to the SI basea

on investigations conducted under this program.

2) The field has developed four security informants or poten-

tial security informants.

3) 14 individuals were found to be employed in sensitive posi-

tions requiring additional investigation or dissemination on

our part.

At the inception of this program, there were 17, 783 names

included in the CI and approximately one-fourth of this total would

have been handled by the field as of 1/15/59.

In addition to the results tabulated under items 1, 2 and 3

above,.

there have been a number of cooperative interviews resulting

from investigations conducted under this program.

Cooperative

views under this program produce additional intelligence data,

inter-

provide sources of information, and provide a potential reservoir of

possible witnesses in various type hearings even though interviewees

may not be potential security informants.

Ine Communist Index (CI) was designed to represent a

list of individuals who should, in the light of ever-changing

conaitions, De continually borne in mina with a view towara possible

investigation under the security Index (51) program. Bulet.

of 10/2/58

issued instructions to the field to re-examine cases of individuals

whose names are included in the CI, the re-examination to be conducted

in equal monthly installments over a 12-month period.

Quarterly reports were required of the field in connection with

this program and reports received from the field for the period from

1/15 to 7/15/59 have been reviewed and they show the following statisti

cal results:

1) The names of 32 individuals have been added to the sI Based

on investigations conducted over this period. (During the

•previous quarter, the names of 30 individuals were so added.)

2i The field has under development eight security informants

or potential security informants. (For the period ending

4/15/59, this figure was 15.)

3)

66 individuals were found to be employed in key facilities

and/or sensitive positions,

requiring additional investigation

or dissemination on our part.

For the period ending 4/15/59,

this figure was 63.).

At the inception of the program, there were 17, 783 names

included in the CI.

Reviews during the past nine months have resulted.

in the removal of 1, 768 names, with the CI containing at present 13,015

names.

These 4,68 individuals are either deceased, their names returned

to the sI, or otherwise do not qualify for inclusion in the CI.

Memorandum for Mr. Belmont

Re: COMMUNIST INDEX

-

In addition to the above statistical results, other advantages

have resulted from the program. Cooperative interviews have been

obtained in many instances.

Each case opened results in the obtaining

of, as o minimum, current residence and employment,

thus bringing

to date our information concerning the subject's activities.

FOr

example, during this past quarter, the New York Office handled 1,369

CI cases. Of this number, it was found that 557 of the individuals

naa changed either residence or employment or both with an additional

16 individuals having moved to other field office territories,

necessitating changes in office of origin.

OBSERVATIONS:

The results being obtained from this program justify the time

and effort necessarily involved in re-examination of the CI. This

Index lists individuals who, next to isl subjects, present the greatest

potential threat to the internal security.

ACTION:

This program will be followed and you will be advised of the

final results obtained upon completion of the program on 10/15/59.

10-2-58 issued instructions to the field to re-examine cases of

conducted in equal monthly installments over a 12-month period.

The field was required to submit quarterly reports concerning

progress being made.

Final reports have now been received from the field in

connection with this program.

such reports have been reviewed and

they show that the following statistical results were achieved during

the year that the program was in effect:

1) The names of 120 individuals were added to the SI based on

investigations conducted in the program.

Initiation of the development of 28 security informants or

potential security informants las accomplished.

3, 249 inarviduals were found to be employed in key facilities

and/ or sensitive positions, requiring additional investigation

or dissemination on our part.

In addition to the statistical results set out above, other

advantages have resulted from the program. Each case opened resulted,

as a minimum,

in the obtaining of current residence and employment

data, thus bringing up to date our information concerning the subject.

It uas found that a considerable number of the individuals on the

CI had changed either residence or employment ana, therefore, as a

RE: COMUNIST INDES.

'In addition, the names of a considerable number of individuals

ascertained to have died or otherwise not qualified for inclusion in

the CI, were removed from such Index.

At the inception of the program

there were 17, 783 names included in the CI. At the present time such

Index contains the names of 12, 781 individuals. The program has thus

been of benefit in purging the Index of individuals no longer qualified

for inclusion therein, thereby resulting in making the Index a more

workable one.

It is to be noted that at the recent Internal Security -

Espionage Conference, 10/22-23/59, the CI was the subject of discussion.

The Conference felt that a periodic re-examination of the C'I would be a

desirable thing to do if and when manpower commitments and other urgent

matters would permit, and recommended that the matter of such a

re-examination again

be considered at the next Internal security -.

Espionage Conference.

ACTION:

For information.

Te will continue to follow the status of

the us and at the time of the next Internal security - Espionage

conference, or at such other time as conditions indicate it desirable,

will again give consideration to re-examination of the CI.

SECURITE INVESTIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS

COMMUNIST INDEX

Regarding the question of establishing a reserve index

composed of those individuals whose activities in subversive

organizations do not quite bring them within the security Index

(SI) criteria, the following proposals are offered.

Each field office presently maintains a communist Index

(CI) separate and apart from the sI designed to represent those

individuals who should be continually borne in mina from the stand-

point of the security of the country with a view toward possible

investigation, interrogation or action at some future date.

Ipropose to rename this index the "Reserve Index." It is felt that

this name would be more descriptive as this Index also contains the

names of individuals formerly affiliated with subversive

organizations other than the Communist Party (CP).

We recognize that some individuals included in this Index

represent a greater potential threat than others.

For example,

¡individuals in public life who are in a position

• to exert considerable

influence, such as professors who teach the CP line, present more of

'a threat than would a common laborer. A similar situation exists

in connection with our sI and we have taken steps to identify such

individuals for priority

apprehension. Therefore, in connection

with the "Reserve Index," we propose to set up two sections,

Section A and Section B.

Section A

We suggest that this section include those individuals

whose subversive activities do not bring them within the sI criteria

e others gainst the nati

their subversive associations and ideology. Included therein

Fle feel that the cases on these individuals should be

brought up to date annually and evaluated for sI purposes or for

Section B

This section of the "Reserve Index" would be handled as

we are now handling the present CI in the individual field offices.

Standaras for inclusion of names in the "Reserue Index"

would, at present, be similar to the standards for inclusion in the

For additional infornation this Index has been schediled

for discussion at the forthcoming Internal security - Espionage

Conference on June 9.10, 1960, the discussion to cover such points

as the current adequacy of our standaräs for inclusion in the

Index and the question as to whether we should establish a systematic

review on a periodic basis of the cases on the individuals listed

the consensus of

opinion that this particular point of the criteria should be utilized

sparingly and with sound judgment as to the potential dangerousness

of the individual subject. Among the type of cases now arising are

individuals with long Communist Party (CP) history although no known

membership within the past five years. It was felt that this long

history in the CP should be given definite weight in retaining an

individual

on the SI and that usually some "plus" factor will exist

in the individual case such as

training in the Lenin School, service

during the Spanish Civil War, leadership training or assignments

or activity during the underground period of the CP in the arly 1950's.

It was recognized that the facts in each individual, case must

All necessary instructions dealing with the establishment

of section A of the Reserve Index and forms to be used in connection

therewith are in the hands of all field offices. He should begin to

receive nominations for inclusion in section A of the Reserve Index

in the immediate future. Plans have been completed with the siatistica

Voucher section for the handling of this matter. The mechanics insojar

as the handling in the Subversive Control Section will be as follows.

1) The field's nominations for inclusion in the Reserve

Index,

Section A, will be reviewed by the substantive case supervisor;

the unit supervisor in charge and by my office with final approval

on the section chief's level except very close cases which will be

referred to you for a decision.

2) The field's recommendation will then be forwarded to

the statistical-Voucher Section in order that cards may be printed.

Four cards are to be returned to the subversive Control Section and

will be distributed (a) 2 to the field office, (b) 1 will be filed

in Boom 1256 in strict alphabetical order. The remaining card will

be forwarded to the SAC, quantico, where it will be filed in alpha-

betical order. Inese cards are to be filed by the SAc, quantico,

separate and apart from our security Index cards, a set of which is

also maintained at cuantico.

3) Recommendations for deletion from the Reserve Index

and destroy it. The card maintained at the Bureau will be destroyed.

4) Additions to, deletions from, and changes in Section A

of the Reserve Index will be handled on a daily basis as is the case

in connection with our Security Index cards.

Re: SECURITY INDEX

In checking this list against your Security

Index

the following itens should be considered and handled

as follows:

1) If the name of a subject on the list is not

his correct Security Index status.. An appro-

priate hotation should be placed adjacent to

the subject's name on the enclosed list

Showing

the correct Security Index status

for the subject.

If his name should be

deleted from the Burcau's Security Index,

the

•notation should refer to the previous communi-

cation fron your office which recommended

cancellation.

If you do not have a Security

Index card for the subject and a card should.

be in your Index, the notation should request

the Bureau to forward cards to your office.

2)

If this check discloses the names of

subjects in your Security Index which do not

appear on the list, the names of such subjects

and the Bureau file number (where known) should

be set forth on & separate sheet of paper with

the date that the subject was recommended for

inclusion in the Security Index. Instances of

this nature wiis occur in those cases where

subjects have recently been recommended for

inclusion in the Index and were not included

therein at the time of printing of the list but

cards have subsequently been prepared at the

Bureau. Instances of this nature may also

occur in tnose cases where cancellation of &

security index card has recently been recom-

nended by you ind you have not vet received

Bureau authorization to cancel.
