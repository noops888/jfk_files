a. WOOD said that he was calling from a pay

phone in a beara Roebuck store in Dallas. He provided

& home telephone number, which we have not been able

to verily, and he believes that this telephone is bugged.

b. WOOD had found the telephone number of

DI. Aldrich in the directory. His only previous call was

made in 1966, when he requested a recommendation for

& newspaper job for which he was applying. Dr. Aldrich

referred him to Pereonnel.

c. Subject told DI. Aldrich on 27 December that

he had information which he urgently wanted to communicate

to ClA. He sounded upset.

14. C/CI/R&A advised Dr. Aldrich that 11 Subject telephoned

again, he should be told that his call had been referred to the proper

authorities. Because of the information reported above, there was

a possibility of provocation.

15. In the mid-afternoon of 28 December 1968 Subject again

telephoned Di. Aldrich from an unknown location. He asked whether

someone would be in touch with him. Dr. Aldrich said that Subject'e

information had been relayed to those responsible and that he had no

information about future contact. Subject said that he was not trying

to involve Dr. Aldrich but that he did have information to relay. He

sounded leas frightened than on his previous call. He suggested that

whoever called or visited him should idontlly himself by referring to

information held in common (i.e., to

1a 1951-1952). Out of a

job, WOOD had received two or three offere of employment but was not

mure of the identitiea of the prompective employers and feared

provocation, presumably from Garrison'e office. Apparently he belteves

that the FBI la monitoring bie hore telephone.

16. It to our intent to ank the Bureau to relay this information

to ita office in Dallas and to instruct an FBI representative to call

upon Subject and requeat elucidation, because such Information
