Re Philadelphia airtel 5/28/64 in captioned matter

and Bureau letter to Philadelphia

dated 6/2/64.

Re Philadelphia communications proposed that two

Special Agents, whose identities would be unknown to

PH 672-C-TE, render assistance to this informant in preparation

for opening a luncheonette at 900 South 8th Street, Philadelphia,

Pa. It was proposed that these agents, under previously

explained pretext, could, with complete security, install

microphone coverage at both 900 and 902 South 8th Street,

Philadelphia.

It is pointed out that there would be no security

problems involved in this endeavor.

There would be no

compromise of the Bureau's confidential techniques.

Re Phila-

delphia communications pointed out that if any breach of

security developed, the installation would not be made.

The installation would be made by the two sound

men whose identities would not be known to the informant.

The informant, with the assistance of ANGELO BRUNO, Commission

member and head of Philadelphia family of LaCosa Nostra,

employed as a truck driver working from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily

Accordingly, he would

be present while coverage was

being effected.

In addition, accompanying FD142 re coverage

proposed at, 900 South oth Street, under item #9, pointed out

that both FRANK MONTE and FRANK NARDUCCI,

both known members

of LaCosa Nostra, have promised source that they would

frequent this luncheonette if he was successful in opening

It was also pointed out that this luncheonette is

in the area most frequented by LaCosa Nostra members and

it would be the only luncheonette in this area where the

proprietor himself is a member of LaCosa Nostra.

It should not be overlooked that this source would

be extremely valuable in checking on the veracity of the

confidential informant involved.

It is believed that these reasons would indicate

that coverage of 900 South 8th Street has a high potential.

In addition, it is pointed out that coverage at

902 South 8th Street has extremely high potential inasmuch

as it 1s a known and established fact that ANGELO BRUNO

uses this location almost on a daily basis to hold meetings.

It is explained that the informant will not have

knowledge of the fact that microphone coverage will be

utilized in either 900 or 902 South 8th Street.

His employ-

ment is such that he will not be present.

He will not know

the identities of the agents with whomhe is dealing.

Philadelphia has deliberately developed this

situation, telling the informant that it would be advantageous

for him to have the luncheonette to show as a legitimate

income, considering that he is on probation in both Phila-

delphia and Montgomery Counties, Pa.

He has been advised

that the contacting agent would help him make preparations

for opening the luncheonette by obtaining the services of

individuals, who have not been identified to the informant,

in painting and making other necessary preparations for opening

the luncheonette.

It has been considered that 902 South 8th Street,

Philadelphia, would be the most advantageous position to

obtain microphone coverage known to this division, inasmuch

as ANGELO BRUNO meets his criminal associates at this location

on a daily basis.

It 1s further noted that PH 672-C-TE should be

a drawing card to the luncheonette and it is anticipated that

this luncheonette will become

a meeting place in the

neighborhood. ANGELO BRUNO'S

place of business is less

than

200 yards from this location.

Philadelphia, accordingly, requests that authoriza-

tion for microphone coverage at both

900 and 902 South 8th

Street be reconsidered. Time is of the essence in this

It is requested that the Laboratory, provided

authorization is granted by the Bureau, immediately forward

to the Philadelphia Division a Minnimite suitable for

penetrating a wall.

In addition, a Minnimite that would

housing of a public telephone which is

to be installed in the rear roam of 900 south 8th Street,

where the luncheonette will be located. It is felt

that these types of installations will afford security and

will not be available for inspection by unauthorized

telephone personnel.

It is noted that the Minnimite or other

microphones suggested by the Laboratory will be in an area

where voice volumes will fluctuate; consequently, it is

requested that equipment be provided, if available, that

has an automatic volume control.
