DETAILS: The JFK Task Force uses two distinct computer

operations (1) the inventorying of each document in each of our

files and (2) the creation of Identification Aids.

Operation #1 is using R-Base via token ring to store

for later research the description of each document.

Eight IWS

computers are available to create the inventory.

During the day

shift (8 a.m. to 4 p.m.) five of the eight computers are used to

enter/edit inventory data.

The other three computers are used by

analysts to inquire about the data stored. During the night

shift (4 p.m. - midnight) four employees are entering or editing

During the midnight shift (midnight - 8 a.m.) two

employees are entering data.

At times

• (normally 3 - 4 times per

week) the hardware and/or software is unresponsive and we cannot

enter data.

This requires technical adjustment by Manfred

Patterson or Carrie Perry.

When more than two people are making

inquiries we usually experience delays as the computer searches

for the document we need.

We are told that the delays are the

result of the inadequate size of the R-Base and/or the result of

too many people inquiring at one time.

Memorandum from Terry I. O'Connor to Mr. Baugh, dated 9/20/93

Re:

Operational Status of Computer

Hardware/Software

JFK Task Force

The JFK Task Force began using computers for operation

#1 in August, 1992, and the Task Force was advised that R-Base

was the most

logical storage mechanism which was available to the

FBI for our inventory which inventory would eventually exceed

157,000 documents.

Jack Sobolewski and Manfred Patterson have

provided excellent computer support for the task force and they

have always responded promptly to any requests for assistance.

Mr. Patterson has even split the database in two components to

help us expedite our searches.

The Task Force recommended and it

was approved that Mr. Patterson receive an on-the-spot award for

his work in writing

a software program to support the inventory

process.

In the past three months Carrie Perry has

worked with

Manfred

Patterson to solve problems when the computers' become

unresponsive.

Mr. Sobelewski has

suggested 'that.a file server will

speed up the

response time and reduce errors but will not solve

all problems.

Software problems might continue to exist. They

also noted that the file server is very expensive and has already

been previously requested by Carey Linton for other applications.

We are presently having no trouble with the computer

hardware used in Operation #2.

Operation #2 requires the

creation and placement of data (Identification Aids) on a

disk

using

software designed by the National Archives and Records

Administration (NARA) • NARA provides the disks for the software

which was designed in

December, 1992 (and updated in June and

September, 1993).

Nine IWS computers are being used to enter

JFK Task Force from the Executive Agencies Dissemination Unit.

Beginning 9/13/93, we will have approximately 20 people creating

Identification Aids in rough draft and nine people entering the

data.
