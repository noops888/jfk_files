ADMINISTRATIVE:

On October 11, 1963, DN 249-C advised SA PAUL E. BUSH

that some four years ago he was in frequent contact with FELIX

ALDERISIO in Chicago and at that time ALDERISIO's close associa-

tes were OBBIE FRABOTTA and CHUCKIE ENGLISH, who were generally

rumored to be muscle men for ALDERISIO and who would ordinarily

be called upon to handle any "muscling" operations for him.

card co

Informant expressed the opinion that if ALDERISIO has any in-

as any in-

tention of attempting to do away with EGAN at Denver or else-

where it was his belief that FRABOTTA or ENGLISH might be

assigned to handle the job.
