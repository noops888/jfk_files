Memorandum Branigan to Sullivan

RE:

ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT

JOHN FITZGERALD. KENNEDY\

62-109060

OP. SECRE

We feel we should disseminate this data since

we have previously disseminated the information we received

from Yuri Nosenko regarding the assassination even though

we recognized some of the data was not subject to proof,

particularly, that occurring within the Soviet Union.

We feel that

by documenting (Shamrocklas a "confidential

informant, contact with whom has been insufficient to

establish his reliability," we will alert other agencies

that the information has not been established as true

We have received information from numerous other

sources that the Soviets did mourn

the death of President

Kennedy and that soviet leaders felt they could work with

president Kennedy.Au/

ACTION:

If you approve, we will disseminate the data furnished

by the Shamrock informant as set out herein to the Department; (S)

to sècret Service,

to State Department and to Central

Intelligence AgencyTE
