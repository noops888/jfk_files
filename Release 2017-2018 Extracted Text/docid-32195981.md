The Garrison Investigation of the

Assassination of President Kennedy

Alleged CIA Connections with Garrison's

Suspects

SECRET

' New Orleans

• District Attorney James C. Garrison has

made numerous charges that several of his suspects in his

investigation of the assassination of President Kennedy have

had connections with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

There follows some of his specific allegationg which we have

learned about either from Garrison's public statements or

from FBI sources and the known comments of the CIA with respect

thereto.

2.

Garrison claims that Lee Harvey Oswala did not

kill President Kennedy but that the President was assassinated

by five anti-Castro Cubans who were angered over his handling

of the Bay of Pigs invasion.

Garrison claims that the assassins

were former CIA employees committed to an adventure in Cuba.

Garrison has said that he does not believe the CIA planned

Kennedy murder, or knew of it beforehand, but that the CIA is

making every effort to prevent his office. from trailing or leam-

CIA was quoted in the newspapers as stating

that the organization would have no comment on

Garrison's remarks. (Evening Star, 5/22/672 JAN 18 1971

2.

Garrison has reportedly said that he has| letters

signed by CIA representatives or by Senator Robert E

. Kenneay

which authorize certain Americans to work with Cubans for the

assassination of Castro. (FBI Memo 5/17/67)

CIA advised the Bureau In May 1967 that such

letters never existed and therefore could not

be in the possession of Garrison. (FBI Memo

5/17/67)

3.

Garrison reportedly believes that there was an anti-

Castro training camp on the shores of Lake Ponchartrain near

New Orleans which was operated by the CIA to train assassins

to send to cuba and that Oswald was once at the camp. This camp

was reportedly run by an individual known as Richard Davis:

(FBI Memos 4/6/67, 5/15/67)

To our knowledge, no information has been

received from CIA concerning the alleged

training

camp

or Richard Davis. An FBI

memorandum of

March 3, 1967, reported that

the Bureau files contain no information indi

cating that Oswald had any connection with

Davis. Davis has been described as a pro-

moter

and

hustler, who will do anything for

money, and is often carried away with his own

thinking. (149-4801)

Garrison claims that Oswald was probably a CIA agent

who worked undercover with anti-Castro Cubans with the knowledge

of Federal agents.

Garrison claims that Oswald was recruited

by CIA for an operation.

5. Garrison has charged that the CIA gave the Warren

Commission a fake photograph instead of providing a picture of

Lee Harvey Oswald and a Cuban companion leaving the Cuban Embassey

In Mexico City in 1963, because Oswald and/or his Cuban companion

were CIA agents.

CIA has furnished the Criminal Division of

the Department with an affidavit that they

do not have, and have never had, a photograph

of Oswald in Mexico City.

Garrison has charged Gordon Novel and Sergio Arcacha

Smith with the burglary of the Schunberger Well Service Company's

munitions bunker in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, in 1951:

Gordon

Novel reportedly contends that he was employed by CIA, was act-

ing for CIA, and that the burglary of the munitions bunker was

not, an actual burglary.

Novel reportedly contends that CIA had

an arrangement with Schumberger to keep ammunition, bomb casings,

and other material in the ammunition bunker; that Schumberger

became upset over the Bay of Pigs invasion and wanted to get out

of their contract with CIA; and that arrangements were then mede

for the bomb casings and other materials stored in the bunker to

Novel has indicated that

he and Sergio Arcacha, smith are still employed by CIA.

Novel

has stated that in the event he is returned to New Orleans to

face charges of burglary, this will be his defense. (FBI Memo

4/24/67) Novel also claims that he once operated the Evergreen

Advertising Agency as a front for CIA communications and that

funds were channelled to him by CIA.: (FBI Memo 4/27/67) Gordon

Novel's attorney also stated on May 25, 1967, that Novel worked

who has been charged by Garrison with conspiracy to assassinate

President Kennedy, was a CIA agent involved in ari anti-Castro

p.lot which either backfired or was redirected against President

Kennedy.

on May 9, 1901, Deputy Director Cabell, CLA,

was introduced

before his speech to the roreigi

Policy Association in New Orleans by Clay Shaw,

who was the program director, and that from

December 1948 through May 1956, TA's Domet

Contact Service did have some relationnhip with

Shav, as it was interested in Shaw's inter-

national contacts.

CIA claims that the last
