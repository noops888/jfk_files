JEK Act 6 (4)

During the Fall of 1953, the Algam Corporation

came under investigation by the

state appointed Moreland

Act commission, which was investigating harness racing

tracks.

After numerous hearings, the Old Country Trotting

Association, Incorporated was ordered to sell its Yonkers

stock under a common ruling which banned interlocking direct-

orates in- the harness racing industry.

Other New York hoodlun interests inirace tracke was

reported on September I0, 1958;

"by PCI,

on that datel

advised that SALVATORE GRANELLO

and his partner and associate GEORGE LÃ‰VINE are the present

owners of the

Oriente Park Race Track in Havana, Cuba.-

le informant a

advised that these Individuais aiso operate

gambling casinos at the track site and obtain most of

their revenue from this. latter activity.

Regarding the Oriente Park Race Track, an interview

with well known hoodlum MEYER LANSKY by Bureau agents in

1939 indicated, according to LANSKY, that he and FRANK

ERICKSON, nationally known New York gambler, had in 1938

obtained a six year contract to operate the

track. LANSKY

at that time failed to indicate the exact degree of

ownership that he and ERICKSON exercised in the operation

of the track.

C. Degree of Influence

No additional information is known concerning

the amount of influence exerted by the above individuals

in the operations of

the tracks involved, other than

that set out above.

It is also noted that although NICHOLAS RATTENNI

holds a large block of voting stock in Roosevelt Raceway.

here was as of August, 1958, over six and one hall millior

shares of stock outstanding in that corporation.

It would appear, however, that in sizing up the

degree of influence exerted by these individuals on the

entire industry in the New York Division that it could be

considered negligible.
