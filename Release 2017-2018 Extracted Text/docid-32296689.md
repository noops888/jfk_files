INTERNAL SECURITY - CUBA

It has been previously reported that

CONRADO RODRIGUEZ SANCHEZ, a Cuban exile and former

labor leader in Cuba, now

residing in Miami, represents

the Accion Sindical Independiente (ASI) and

the Junta

Cubana Revolucionaria (JCR). The ASI is the labor

grOUP Of JCR.

In December, 1972, and January, 1973,

information was received indicating that RODRIGUEZ

planned to begin terrorist activities in the event

the United States should sign an agreement with

FIDEL CASTRO of Cuba. RODRIGUEZ reportediy said

that

the principal targets would be ships and diplomatic

offices belonging to countries which trafficked with

Cuba.

On February 26, 1973, as previously

reported, a Miami source tho

is acquainted with some

members of the ASI, reported that RODRIGUEZ intended to

kill five individuals, since the United States hau

entered into an agrcement with Cuba on the subject of

hijacking. He named one of his intended victims as a

professor who has beon identified as professor JAIME

on the staff of the University of Miami..

When interviewed

on March 1, 1973, by Special Agents of the FBI, RODRIGUEZ

denied that his organizations had any intention of

violating any U.S. laws by attacking ships, diplomatic

establishments, or any individuals in the U. S. or elsewhere.

CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS

On April 9, 1973, the same Miami source

reported that RODRIGUEZ reiterated that sometime within

the very near future, his men would place bombs in the

homes of some individuals who are working for peaceful

co-existence.

for same would be claimed by a fictitious clandestine

organization. He added that his plans included attack

on some ship which is trafficking with the CASTRO regime.

He did not identify any of the individuals whose homes

he said he would bomb, nor did he identily any particular

EARLE

ship or the country of registry of any such ship.

Source informed RODRIGUEZ that he had

learned through friends at the University of Miami that

SUCHLICKI is opposed to peaceful co-existence between

the United States and Cuba, that SUCKLICKI has the

reputation of being anti-Conmunist, and that SUCRLICKI

appeared on a Miami television program there he definitely

expressed hinself in opposition to peaceful co-existence.

RODRIGUEZ said that might be so, and that in any event,

he is too busy with other plans

to be concerned about

SUCHLICKI.

Source reported on April 12, 1973 that

RODRIGUEZ disclosed on the previous day that he will

continue his plans for bombings, but again he did not

supply the targets.

The source

said that RODRIGUEZ is

now employed as a salesman at Biltmore Motors, Miami.

It is to be noted that in the past, RODRIGUEZ

has disclosed the existence of plans of violence to other

sources, but none of these have yet been carried out.

ANDRES NAZARIO SARGEN, head of Alpha

that they were being

served with a warning that the U.S. Government would vigorously

investigate and prosecute any violations of Federal law

occasioned by Cuban exiles in opposition to the hijacking agreement

between the United States and Cuba.

Both of these individuals

were requested to pass the word along to other Cuban exile

organizations and individuals. This was done in order to protect

MM 1337-S by giving RODRIGUEZ the impression that his interview

by FBI Agents was the result of a general program.

Also, as an additional means of causing RODRIGUEZ to

cancel out his

plans against sUchLICkI, MM 1337-s was instructec

to notify RODHIGUEZ that he had researched SUCHLICKI by making

inquiry of some of his contacts at the University of Miami and

had determined it would be a grave mistake for RODRIGUEZ to

subject of hijackings. RODRIGUEZ named one of these intended

victims as a Professor JAIME SOSLICKI (phonetic) of the

University of Miami and formerly of Cuba.

SOSLICKI as a Polish professor and member of the "Radical

Left" who had made trips to Chile.

RODRIGUEZ expressed the desire for publicity and

said that he would use a phone name "Comandos Pedro Luis Boitel"

in order to claim credit for these acts of terror.

RODRIGUEZ commented that he is now in the process of

collecting information concerning the habits and routine of

SOSLICKI. RODRIGUEZ did not furnish further details.

On February 26, 1973, Mr. DAVID WIKE, Associate Director

of Security, University of Miami, advised that

a Professor

JAIME SUCHLICKI, a Cuban National of Polish ancestry, is on

the staff at the University of Miami and has been making

international studies on the subject of Latin American

revolutions and counter-revolutions.

He has also authored

books concerning revolutionary activities of students.

One of

his recent books is entitled

"Cuba, Castro and Revolution"

Mr. WIKE described Professor SUCHLICKI as being a research

analyst and anti-Communist. He was also one of the motivators

of the American Institute of Free Labor Development which

concluded several days ago a 2-week session at Miami Beach.

Pertinent information concerning

the alleged threat

made against Professor SUCHLICKI, as described above, was

furnished to Mr. WIKE who said he would immediately notify

Professor SUCHLICKI, the Coral Gables, Florida Police Department

which has jurisdiction over the University of Miami, and

the

Dade County Public Safety Department which has jurisdiction over

Professor SUCHLICKI's residence at 8800 S.W. 54th Terrace.

Mr. WIKE also agreed to immediately provide

security for

Professor SUCHLICKI on the University of Miami Campus.

On February 27, 1973, MM T-l advised that he had

been unable to obtain any additional information

from RODRIGUEZ

who has indicated that at the present time he is laying the

ground work for carrying out his plans.

On March 1, 1973, Special Agents of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation interviewed CONRADO RODRIGUEZ SANCHEZ

at a construction project in the 800 block of Ponce De Leon

Blvd., Coral Gables, Florida, where he was working.

RODRIGUEZ was notified that any violations of Federal

law or State law by Cuban exile organizations or anyone else

based upon opposition to the recent hijacking agreement

between the United States and

Cuba would be vigorously prosecuted.

RODRIGUEZ asserted that his organizations, the ASI

and JCR, have no intention whatsoever of violating any U.S.

laws by attacking ships, diplomatic establishments or any

individuals in the United States or elsewhere, despite the

fact that he is personally opposed to the hijacking agreement.

He explained that his opposition is based upon that portion

of the agreement which requires the U.S. to return to Cuba

RODRIGUEZ said that he has learned from the example

concerning the prosecution by the Federal Government of ORLANDO

BOSCH AVILA, a notorious bomber convicted in 1968, that it is

foolish to engage in such acts of violence.

RODRIGUEZ

added, however, that he will, through

freedom of speech, continue to oppose the Communist Regime

Of TIDEL CASTRO and will voice opposition to peaceful co-

existence with Cuba.

RODRIGUEZ said thÃ¤t he is personally

depressed by the fact that the new generation of Cuban exiles

in this country have little knowledge or interest in the Cuban

problem as it exists today.

On November 22, 1972, MM T-1 who is acquainted with

some

members of the ASI in the Miami area advised that RODRIGUEZ

disclosed that on November 24 and 25, 1972, there would be a

national conference in New York City of members of the ASI

and the JCR along with some young Cubans who had received

military training. RODRIGUEZ said that although it would

be specifically announced that this was a political meeting,

the real purpose of the convention was to work out plans on

a national level for terrorism in the event United States and

the communist Cuba should reach some kind of an understanding

or political arrangement.

He claimed that if such an agree:

ment was entered into between the United States and Cuba his

group would be ready to carry out sabotage all over the United

states and Canada.

He asserted that he already has explosive

experts located in various parts of the United States.

On December 8, 1972, MM T-1 advised that RODRIGUEZ

after returning from the congress in New York City, said

that those in attendance had taken the necessary measures

and reached the necessary agreements so that if the United

States signed an agreement with FIDEL CASTRO,

they could

begin terrorist activities in the United States.

He said

that the principal targets would be ships belonging to

countries which traffic with Cuba. Other targets would

be the diplomatic offices of countries which maintain

relations with CASTRO.

would avoid attacks against American ships or installations

in order to avoid prosecution by United States investigative

agencies. RODRIGUEZ said that the places where they have

their best men for such activities are New York, New Jersey,

Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, D.C. and Miami.

On JanÃºary 31, 1973, MM T-1

advised that RODRIGUEZ

had just disclosed that his organization has now established

the necessary connections with various labor organizations

in Latin America and the United States to carry out sabotage

against property of the Castro regime along with the property

of any country which maintains relations of any type with

CASTRO.

RODRIGUEZ pointed out that he has confidential

relations with the AFL-CIO which is willing to make economic

contributions and supply confidential information on the

ports where ships tie up with merchandise from the communist

world.

RODRIGUEZ pointed out that at the moment, more

than

six major organizations in six different countries

have

promised to work together to carry on sabotage activities

against the communist regime in Havana. He also claimed

that they would carry out terrorist attacks against individuals,

Cuban or foreign, in the United States who collaborate with

or sponsor co-existence with the Castro regime. He said

that they already have explosives located in various countries
