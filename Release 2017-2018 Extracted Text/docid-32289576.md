He used to have a special bank officer,

an American, whom

he contacted to handle his business per-

sonally. This man has changed jobs and is now New Business

Manager of a mercantile bank located on 57th Avenue and

Southwest 9th Street.

bạnk.

years.. He has been in personal contact during the past

four years on numerous occasions asking for loans and advice.

MACHO GENER who would arrange the meeting. GENER was for-

merly a Representative in Cuba and was employed by TRAFFICANTE

at $100 per week to take any calls, make appointments and

generally be the "arranger", GENER no longer has this

position and now if source wants to contact TRAFFICANTE

he must do so through GARCIA VIDAL:

RAUL, GONZALEZ JEREZ, formerly of the Club Intimo

was very close to SANto in Cuba and presumably is a close

friend. He is not connected to the bolita activities in

Miami

SANTO once mentioned to source that EVARISTO

had given him $20,000 that he needed.

Source has net with SANTO after the appointments

made by GENER at the Doral Beach Hotel; Sonny's Restaurant

in Miami Beach on several occasions; and also several times

at the Mayflower Restaurant on Northwest 36th Street and

Miami Avenue.

EVARISTO mentioned to source on one occasion

that SANTO had made & lot of money in the exporting of

television and small appliances from Tampa.

SAM MONDELLO, & longtime associate of TRAFFICANTE

from Tampa has recently moved into Key West

and set up a

gambling operation there.

On May 2, 1967, Detective Sergeant ADAM CARTER,

the RANDAZZO residence. Source advised that TRAFFICANTE

is extremely upset over the round-the-clock surveillances

being conducted both in Tampa and Miami. In Miami, the

police sit outside his house and follow him whenever
