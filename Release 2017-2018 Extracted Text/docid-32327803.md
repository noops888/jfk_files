since certain information was not received from the auxillary

that he had just been contacted by ROCKY GRAZIANO and was ordered

by GRAZIANO not to leave town on business for the West Coast

any further developments in this respect.

the informant is convinced this matter has not been forgotten

and will be repeated in the immediate future.

The informant further stated that he had been

recently advised by his attorney, that the latter had been told

y the former attorney of JOHN KEILLY, that KEILLY is in

onsiderable trouble relative to conversion of approximatel:

$25,000.00 to his own use and issuing a bad check to cover

the maneuver.

According to the informant, the victim of this

deal, name unknown to the inbrmant at the present time, has

threatened to file a complaint.

The informant stated

. that he

/would endeavor to ascertain additional information relative to

this matter.

During the early part of February, 1964, NY 3936-C

advised SA WILLIAM A. VERICKER, that SALLY BURNS and ROCKY

GRAZIANO have a fighter, who was scheduled to fight in Puerto

Rico, on Saturday, February 15, 1964. BURNS told the informant

that

he wanted to go to Puerto Rico to see the fight, but was

restricted because of his bail in the SDNY, relative to an income

tax matter.

On 2/10/64, BURNS and his attorney filed a petition

before the US District Court,

SDNY, to get permission to travel

to Puerto Rico. This permission was denied by the court and

on 2/11/64, BURNS indicated to the informant that he still

intended to travel to Puerto Rico with his girl friend on

2/13/64.

on 2/13/64, NY 3936-C advised SA WILLIAM A. VERICKER

On several occasions on 2/13/64, NY 3936-C advised

SA VERICKER that he had been in contact with the subject and

the subject was still undecided whether or not to defy the

court order.

However, late in the afternoon of 2/13/64.

GRANELLO finally decided against any travel to Puerto Rico.

In view of the fact that the subject was dealing directly

with the informant in this matter,

this information has not been

included in the details of instant report.

During

February, 1964, NY 3936-C advised SA VERICKER

that it appears that GRANELLO has a hidden interest in Avon

Wreckers, since GRANELLO approached the informant and asked for

a loan for this company.

The informant stated that an associate

of his had loaned Avon Wreckers $20,000.00 and the latter had

defaulted in their payments.

The informant stated that his

associate presently has a judgement against Avon Wreckers and has

threatened to go to the District Attorney unless GRANELLO Or

the principals of Avon, repay the loan.

During February, 1964, NY 4195-PC advised SA FREDERICK

W. KUHLMAN that one, FRANK VANDERVETTER (phonetic) has been a

close associate of SALLY BURNS during the past few weeks.

nas told VANDERVETTER that RALPH SERRANO owes him, GRANELLO,

approximately $7,000.00. BURNS suggested that VANDERVETTER and

he, GRANELLO, coordinate their efforts to locate SERRANO for

repayment of

this money and also some money owed to VANDERVETTER.

According to the informant, VANDERVETTER and BURNS

are closely aligned because of their mutual and intense interest

in women.

MARLENE MAC LAINE,

MARLENE MAC LAINE

is an exotic dancer, but according to the

information furnished by VANDERVETTER

i to the informant, she is

presently engaged either as a prostitute or an operator of a

house of prostitution.

VANDERVETTER indicated to the informant

that MAC LAINE resided at 300 East 51st Street, NYC, and operated

out of 309 East 51st St., NYC.

ADMINISTRATIVE Cont'a

VANDERVETTER is married to the daughter of the owner

of Rembrandt Frocks, a dress company in NYC. The name of this

individual is not known to the informant. However, the

informant stated that the father-in-law of VANDERVETTER is

completely alienated from VANDERVETTER and regards him as an

individual only interested in his daughter's money. VANDERVETTER

reportedly withdrew all the money available to the : daughter

and is apparently trying to arrange for a large mortgage on a

home owned by the daughter in Harrison, NY.

BURNS is reported to be lending considerable sums of

money to

VANDERVETTER.

The informant theorized that this mones

Is undoubtedly being put out in the form of shylock money anc

that repayment for such loans will undoubtedly come from the

proceeds of the mortgage obtained by VANDERVETTER. In the

vent this maneuver does not materialize, the informant is o

he opinion that GRANELLO will endeavor to exert pressure o

Rembrandt Frocks, through the intercession of VANDERVETTER's wife

with her father.

Since the informant is directly involved with the

subject and VANDERVETTER in this matter, this information has not

peen included in the details of this report.
