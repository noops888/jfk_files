II. Production

Although Subject submitted a good number of, reports

which were of interest

to JMWAVE internally, only

seminations were credited to him during the

UFG-2781 (cable) from Frank Fiorini and Pepin Bosch,

"Frank Fiorini's Agreement to Participate in Air Strike

Against Cuba":

UFG-2901 (cable) from Frank Fiorini, "Request by

Venezuelan National that Frank Fiorini Purchase Arms

for Him'.

Pedro Martinez Fraga,

"Possible Cooperation Between

Manuel A. de Varona and

Manuel Artime

One item of information which Subject received from

Frank Fiorini on 28 May was considered possibly of interest to

readguarters, but probably best not forwarded in reports

Fiorini said

that he had spoken twice during the month with

General Clare Chenault, Jr:, who phoned from California.

Chenault indicated his

desire to participate in the anti-

Castro effort, and asked Fiorini

about the different organ-

izations in the Miami area and their leaders.

reply put Manuel Artime at the head of the list, and noted

that lack of financial backing was Artime's most pressing

problem.

In the second phone call, Chenault recommended

Artime solicit aid from the representatives of the Chinese

Nationalists in Washington,

and urged that nis (Chenault's)

name be used.

Fiorini promised to pass this on to Artime

when the latter returned to the U.S. from a tour of Latin

American countries.

Future Plans

Subject will continue his rounds of the exile conmunity

in general, but will also look for more covert sources of

He will also

be useful for debriefing of now arrivals

connected with revolutionary groups of interast to JiNAVE:

In this regard he should be of considerable assistance in
