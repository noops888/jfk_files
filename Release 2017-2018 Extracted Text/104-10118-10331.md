In addition LIRING-3,

finds himself involved in

the development of a connercial venture, an undertaking for which he is

ill equipped.

This chine shortcoming requires very close guidance by

turn, makes LIRING-3 even pore dependant on his case officer.

Thus, while LIRING~3 occasionally thinks of returning to

Jand develops qualms about, taking money from Rolmon for

what he considers' to be little result, LIKING-3 keeps involving himself

deeper and deeper in activities of interest to ROWTON.

The above does not mean that frang-s's activities should not

be subjected to every operational control possible, on the contraty.

be obtained in Northern Mexico to secure valid Mexican, passports continues;

neerning

Slawson or the Presidential Commission:

telephone conversation bether, Caban

Bertica:

Ambas trelor

On 5 hay, Me. Whitesand Me, Hall met with Mr. Slawso

of the Commission in Mr. Whitten Sloffice. This meeting had been

requested to ask for a fresh translation of the taped conversation

between Cuban President Dorticos atld Ambassador Armas.

Win Scott had told the Commission staff visiting Mexico City that

his translators, in the rush at that time, might have misconstrued

certain nuances of meaning in what was a difficult recording. In

viety of this, Mr. Slawson asked that a new translation be made,

if possible, by à person knowledgeable of the Cuban dialect.

According to Mr. Slawson, only y

esses. Rankin,

Willens, Colemar (?)land he presently koow of the telephone taps

in Mexico City. Slawson, Willens and Coleman were briefed on

the taps during their visit to Mexico City.

3. In about three weeks the staff will begin presenting to

the Commission evidence on the conspirational aspect of the

assassination. At this time, apparently, their evidence is against

the existence of a plot. They will wish to present to the Commission

the Armas - Dorticos conversation. Slawson suggested the possibility

that a knowledgeable CIA man could make this presentation; interpreting

the conversation in the light of our study:

M=. Wilten' said that we will again translate the tape,

using the best available Cuban linquist, and onde again study the

nuances of the conversation.

Any presentation to the Commission,

howevet, would have to be reterred to Messes.

Helms ane Rosca

According to it. Slawson, no member o the

Commission now knows of the telephone taps in México City (he did

not mention Mr. Dulles).

. M?- Whitten carefully briefed Mr. Slawson (probabl

rebriefed-him) on the importance of these telephone taps to Ú.S.

"security and the grave damage that would be done to U.S. - Mexican

relations ifk

owledge of their existence became public.

6. pr. Slawson quite clearly was a bit unhappy that certain

ipformation could not be used, sinde the taps were the only source.

OSWALD's very bad Russian was the example he used. I asked

what opinion Mrs. OSWALD had of her husband's Russiah. She"

thought that he spoke it very well.

7. Mr. Slawson asked if the retranslation of the Dozucos - Armas

conversation could be made available to him by the end of hist weck.

(201-240720)

1. 1p 8

According to Mr Slawsor, the Commission Staffhad come

up with the ided that Silvia DURAN might belinvited to the United

States, ostensibly, to be interxiewed by a periodical, and then

questioned by the Commission. The Chief Justice turned down the

proposal at once, on the ground that she was a Communist and

U,S. - Mexican relations might be damaged. This idea has beet

abandoned.

9 From Mr,. Slawson's remarks it is evident that the

preparation of the Commission's report has begun, and is in its

initial stages

10. Mr. (Whitten called me after the meeting to say that the

work of retranslating the Dorticos-Armas conversation from the

tape had started.
