I: -SCD SUSPICIONS CONCERNING IVAN YEFREMOV

-IVan YEFREMOV, was one of the most prestigious and

talented Russian science fiction writers. He was also a Soviet

scientist and paleontologist.

Nearly every Russian home has al

book written by YEFREMOV.

The source heard a bizarre story, about tarREMov Irom

not cite seen attry Department of the KeB's

Second Chief Directorate (SCD); and his instructors from the

Minsk Higher Counterintelligence School. The story is as

follows.

Shortly after YEFREMOV's death in the 1980s, a man

went

to SCD Headquarters and asked for a meeting with KGB British

specialists.

The man claimed that he had been recruited by

YEFREMOV to

work for British intelligence against the USSR.

The source does not know whether the information' was

valid or not.

After some investigation, however, the SCD

determined

that his trips were always to closed areas of the country....

OLEG

PENKOVSKIY \CAS

when the source first joined the Second (British and

Commonwealth) Department of the KGB's Second Chief Directorate

(SCD) in 1982, he was allowed to read the original SCD files of

the PENKOVSKIY case.

The Second Department was directly

responsible for investigating PENKOVSKIY, and they encourage new

case officers to read. the file to enhance their knowledge and

expertise.

The source was required to get the permission of the

Chief of the Second Department (at that time Nikolai STEKLOV) to

review the file.

The PENKOVSKIY file consists of twelve or more thick

volumes.

Much of the file consists of rather tedious technical

and physical surveillance reports on PENKOVSKIY.

PENKOVSKIY first came under suspicion in 1960 during a

period of time when the SCD decided to place total surveillance

on all British Embassy personnel and their families.

The file

did not indicate why the SCD made this decision, and the source

does not know the reason. According to the source, there was

nothing in the file to suggest that information about PENKOVSKIY

had leaked to the KGB, thereby prompting the SCD to initiate full

-surveillance of all British nationals in the Embassy.

The full surveillance of British Embassy personnel

lasted for several days.

Finally, one of the surveillance teams

observed the wife of a British diplomat, who was not an

intelligence officer, coming out of the

entrance of a shabby

Russian building.

It appeared strange to the surveillance team,.

particularly because she was pregnant.. They continued to watch

the building: A few minutes later, a man emerged from the house.

The KGB followed him with five or

six men in two cars.

They followed the man to an office building of the

State Committee for Science and Iechnology (GKNT). His entry

into this office building fueled their suspicions.

They

subsequently identified the man as oleg PENKOVSKIY.

The SCD then thoroughly checked the entrance of the

shabby Russian house and discovered a likely dead drop under a

radiator. Investigation of PENKOVSKIY rapidly escalated.

The scd and keB surveillance used a camera to illn

PENKOVSKIY's movements and activities. They observed that he

acted in a very suspicious manner.

The SCD also eguipped his living areas with cameras.

certain they were primitive at that time.

the scD realized that they had to intercede, and he was arrested.

The SCD had some thoughts about using him in a controlled double

agent manner to entrap British or American intelligence

personnel, but it was thought to be too risky in this case.

his review of the file, the source estimated that the entire

investigation took about 6-8 months.

After his arrest, PENKOVSKIY immediately informed the

SCD of his contacts with Greville WYNNE and how he was handled by

the CIA and British intelligence.

He told the SCD that he first

went to British intelligence, but they didn't believe him and

thought he was a provocation.

He then went to the Americans who

accepted him. Later, the British also jointed the operation.

During one of his foreign trips, the British made him an

"honorary" Army Colonel and gave him his choice of uniforms. The

I. SCD did not find any espionage paraphernalia at PENKOVSKIY's

workplace, probably because he was too experienced to make that

mistake.

KeB security officials in the first Chief Directorate

(FCD) had previously noted that

PenKovSklY exhibited behavior of

possible security concern (e.g.; too many girls and too much

money), particularly during his tour in Turkey. The KGB's Third

Chief

Directorate, which was normally responsible for the

investigations of

GRu officers who are suspected of treason,

never seriously suspected PENKOVSKIY, however.

PENKOVSKIY had

Following his arrest, PENKOVSKIY fully disclosed the

extent of information he had passed to the Americans and British.

He admitted passing vital information on the Soviet Union's

strategic nuclear weapons and air defense systems.

He also

admitted passing information on GRU operations.

Even before the publication of Peter Wright's book,

mole in the high circles of British counterintelligence fi.e.,

MI-5) •

The source heard about this KGB success

from four

separate sources.

First, the source heard about this success from his

instuctors in the Minsk Higher Counterintelligence School in

These instructors were all retired intelligence and

counterintelligence officers.

Some of them dealt very closely

with the British intelligence target. The only instructor the

responsible for the flood of illegals from Fast Berlin into west

Berlin.

The source did not believe these instructors at first.

He assumed they were exaggerating such accomplishments for their

own aggrandizement.

Subsequently, however, the source had a conversation

with his boss Nikolai STEKLOV,

then chief of the Second (British

and Commonwealth) Department of the KGB's Second Chief

Directorate.

STEKLOV told the source that the KGB did have -a

very good success in MI-5 at a certain perioa.

The conversation with SIEKLOV took place in the early

19805, perhaps 1983. During this conversation, STEKLOV was

recalling old cases and a personal meeting he once had with

British defector Kim PHILBY.

STEKLOV told the source,

you know, there was a third

man they couldn't detect.

It was a

guy who passed all information he could and was as reliable as

PHILBY. "

According to STEKLOV's account, the man was still in

place after PHILBY's defection, and he continued to provide

reliable information to the KGB. PHILBY's defection did not

interfere in the case..

wish

Aleksey Victorovich KOZLOV was a third source who told

the source about this previous penetration of MI-5. KOZLOV was a

long-time KGB officer who served in Britain during the 1950s as a

member of the KGB residency's counterintelligence branch. KOZLOV

had started his KGB career in 1945, right after the war. He

retired from the KGB in 1986.

said to the source

"Do you know what we did in the 1950s?

We

had a very, very high man in British counterintelligence." The

source asked KOZLOV who it was. KOZLOV said that it was either

the chief or one of his deputies.

More recently, following the publication of "Spy

Catcher," the

source heard about this previous penetration

of MI-

5 from Nikolai ZHUKOV, a Directorate K Officer who was stationed

in Britain in the mid-1980s, and may have been expelled.

ZHUKOV

is the KGB First Chief Directorate (FCD) counterpart of

the

officers in the Second Department, SCD. He is responsible for

the Russian Colony in Britain and

for all cypher reports from the

KGB residency in London. He is a frequent visitor to SCD

Headquarters.

During a conversation between ZHUKOV and Second

+ .

Department case officers (including the source) on such cases as

EMERSON and PATTERSON (see previous reports on these cases),

ZHUKOV boasted that these cases were not so significant. A

: discussion then ensued about "the boys in blue," the SCD slạng

_term for M1-5.

According to ZHUKOV, the KGB had a very high

penetration of MI-5 in the past.

In all four cases mentioned above, the subsources

not tell our source the name of the MI-5 penetration.

The source

is not certain whether it was Roger HOLLIS, former chief of MI-5, •

Based on the above accounts, however,

the source is certain it was a man in the top circles of MI-5.

le is also certain that his suosources were not referring t

BURGESS, MACLEAN, Or BLUNT. None of his subsources mentioned the

name of the KGB case officer who handled the MI-5 penetration or

how the penetration was handled.

DEBRIEFER'S COMMENTS:

Needless to say, we will continue to debrief the source

on his knowledge of the above matter with the hope of acquiring

any additional information he may possess.
