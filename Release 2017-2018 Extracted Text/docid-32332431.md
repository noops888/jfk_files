Enclosed for the Bureau are five coples of an

LIM, dated and captioned as above.

It is recommended that this LHM be disseminated

only to the U.S. Department of Justice, it being noted that

GEORGE VOLSKY,

friend of LESNICK,

allegedly plans to contact

Attorney General RICHARD KLEINDIENST concerning this matter.

Miami is requesting

examination by the FBI Laborataly

and Idatification Division

several of the envelopes and

anonynous letters in an effort

to identify the author of these

communications.

REC-53

Miami is of the opinion that the facts contained in

this LHM constitute a vicious attempt to discredit MRALES

and SA DAVIS because of the successful Federal prosecution

Of GUTIERREZ, BOSCH and seven other defendants in 1968.

BOSCH was paroled from prison on 12/15/72, and is alleged to

be a frequent visitor pt Replica. modeshn deniale

MM 105-3492

SA DAVIS has warned MORALES to be on his

guard since the maneuvers of LESNICK could be designed

to establish an alibi of self-defense in the event

MORALES is setup for assassination. It is suspected

that GUTIERREZ and BOSCH may be responsible for the

anonymous letters.

MM 1337-S has expressed the opinion that the

Spanish portion of the anonymous letter is characteristic

of the style of writing of JORGE GUTIERREZ and contains

in a co nerd nato

phrases and expressions frequently used by him.
