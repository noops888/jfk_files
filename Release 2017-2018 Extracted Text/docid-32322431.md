Title: JOHN F. KENNEDY RECORDS COLLECTION

ACT OF 1992 (the Act)

Synopsis: Results of indices

search.

Reference: 62-HQ-1029205 Serial 418

Details: Re Bureau EC to All Field Offices, 5/29/98.

Referenced Bureau EC requested all field offices

conduct a new indices search for any additional information

related to President John F. Kennedy's assassination that may

have been placed on record since the previous search.

A search of Houston's indices to the central records

system failed to locate any additional information.

A search of

the indices was made on the core and related subjects listed in

the referenced Bureau EC. Additionally, an inquiry was made with

the SAC's Secretary concerning any old "archived" SAC

assassination related material. This inquiry also failed to

locate any records.
