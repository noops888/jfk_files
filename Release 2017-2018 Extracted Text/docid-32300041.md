EMISTOWSKI, CHASTINE, BROZ, FOREST JONES and

LEO ANDERSON said they would advise regarding any infor-

mation coming to their attention concerning 1902 Notre

moula ton

Dame Boulevard, Lake Worth, or persons associated there-

with.

Miami will be alert for opportunity to utilize

confidential investigative techniques at that home. U

It is believed that logical leads concerning

that residence and the Sea Breeze Motel, Palm Beach,

looking towards linking subject with their ownership,

have been exhausted in the Miami area insofar as the

history of those places are concerned, and future

investigation will concern current activities at 1902

Notre Dame Boulevard, Lake Worth. U

JOHN R. DAY, Attorney, City Center Building,

Lake Worth, Florida, interview of whom was reported on

the administrative pages of referenced report of SA KELLOGG,

advised on May 8, 1961, on viewing photographs of KRUSE,

never seen GIANCANA. He said he saw KRUSE at the First

Federal Savings and Loan Association, Lake Worth,

subsequent to his last being interviewed and also

suggested that BURNS used to frequent the famous restaurant

in Lake Worth where EDDIE BROZ, son of the owner, would

probably know him. u

On May 8, 1961,

• MM T-4 in instant

report, 1109 Verdun Street,

Riviera Beach, Florida,

advised SAS RICHARD B. KELLOGG and ROBERT W. WISEMAN

that he used to do lawn work for LESLIE KRUSE at KRUSE's

home on Seminole Avenue, Palm Beach, Florida, and obtained

that job by reason of the fact that he was working on the

lawn next door. About four years ago, KRUSE indicated

he could get _

work for a couple of days a week at

a home in Lake. Worth, Florida, and at that time

ANDERSON started doing yard work at 1902 Notre Dame

said he works there

about 2 days a week and

when he went there he was told

just to do his work and

not ask any questions and that

is what he has done. U

said when he first started working

there,

there was no one there and the home was all closed

up. At that time, he was paid either by KRUSE or Mr.

DICK BURNS who was a man who took care of some of the

maintenance on KRUSE's home in Palm Beach and now takes.

care of repairs, etc., on the house in Lake Worth. About .

3 years ago, JAMES FIORE moved into that house as an

overseer and has been there almost continually since that

time, and now pays L

house has been kept open ever since FIORE got there, but

is very seldom, to his knowledge, used by anyone.

said since he is, not around that house too much,

could very well be someone there without his knowing it,

but to his knowledge the last time there was a group of

people there was last New Years, when there was a group

there for a few days, none of whom he could identify.

He said KRUSE was there for a few days about 2 weeks

ago,

but

]did not believe there was anyone with him

and

BURNS was there once this summer reportedly looking

into the possibility of installing central heating and

air-conditioning in the house, but those are the only

persons he has seen this year. He said BURNS always

stays with FIORE when he is in town relative to the house,

and he never knew BURNS to be at the house for any

reason other than contemplated repairs or maintenance. U

said he never did know who owned

that house and never asked any questions about it.

He

said he did not know how FIORE got his job there, but

added he is always there and [

could recall his

leaving for a day or so on only one occasion since he

arrived there. He said the only car FIORE has is a Ford

Station Wagon and he does not. associate a new Thunderbird

with that house.

He said since FIORE started paying him,

he sometimes pays in cash and sometimes by check, but
