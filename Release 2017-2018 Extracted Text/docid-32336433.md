Reference is made to your memoranda of February 14, March 1, and

March 10, 1952, relative to the subject matter.

You state that in

November, 1951 the subject was arrested in Marin County, California

on a bad check, charge, and

subsequently made lengthy statements to the

County District. Attorneyconcerning her alleged association with the

Walter butler Corporation, and certain Government officials,

transarpus of which statements (attached to your nemorandun of February 1ir /

(1952) you advise were furnished to the Bureau by Senator Richard MYNixon

As you are aware, some of the activities involved in

Mrs. Christensen's statement to the Marin County, California officials

were the

subjects of investigation in 1950, the results of which were

incorporated in the reports of Agent Milton L. Snyder, made at Minneapolis,

Minnesota, on October 17 and November 8, 1950, and the report of Agent

Rosser L. Nalls, made at Washington, D.C. on October 19, 1950.

upon the information submitted at that time it was concluded that the

subject's described conduct was not in violation of any Federal. law, and

you were advised on November 29, 1950 that no further investigation of

the matter was desired at that time.

In view, however, of the present allegations

made by the subject

about officials of the Butler Corporation, as well as various Members of

Congress and Government officials, it is desired that further investigation

be made to determine whether there is evidence of the substantive, violation

or a conspiracy to violate,

any Federal law, particularly 18 U.S.C. 201,

202, 204, 205, 216, 218, 432 and 433.

In conducting the interviews involved in this requested investiga

tion, consideration should be given to the questionable reputation of the

subject for moral conduct, integrity, truth and veracity.

graduating.

Her excuses for absences were.

usually quite fantastic.

It was rumored

around the school that she indulged in liquor

and drugs so that we were not sorry when she

left school.

According to the Parole Report of Agent J.P. Gleason, dated

January 2, 1942, at New York City, the subject advised that during the

period February, 1938 to February, 1939, she carried on an affair with

a married attorney of Niagara Falls, New York.

In January, 1939

she was hospitalized in Saginaw, Michigan and received medical treatment

for complications resulting from an abortion.

In February, 1939

she married one Carl Bose in Indiana, whom she claims to have left

after three weeks, obtaining a divorce in September, 1939.

Upon interview,

subject stated that following her divorce in

1939, she renewed relations with the attorney in Niagara Falls and

became pregnant around December, 1939°

It appears from Lauckner's

statement that the attorney was fearful of his reputation, and that he

paid her $10,000 on condition that she would never see him again.

subject states that she accepted the $10,000 and went to Detroit, Michigang.

1940, and thereafter arranged through the attending physician for the

child's adoption.

She says that she moved to New York City in

September, 1940, and thereafter lived at an apartment hotel, during which

time "Vince" regularly gave her $150. per month.

Subject states that

she never had a steady job and never tried to obtain one during the time

she was in New York City.

She admits that during December, 1940 and

January, 1941, she was employed by Polly Adler, operator of a house of

prostitution in New York City, which employment has been verified by a cow

worker.

She also claims to have worked in New York during this period

as a model and night club entertainer, but according to her probation

report did not supply any verifiable information of legitimate employment.

During the spring of 1941 some of the employees at the apartment-

hotel where subject was living concluded that she was possibly a call

girl because of her drinking activities and the number of men who

visited her rooms:

She was described by some of the tenants in the

building as a girl who used foul language and who

was constantly endeavoring to interest men in her.

Investigation at a number of bars and grilles fre-

quented by Lauckner indicated that she was a general

nuisance, a terrible liar, and a thorough tramp.

She was

also described as being noisy and objectionable

after drinking and it appears from the number of

different stories which she told that she was

an invet-

erate and consummate liar.

It is reported that of this period "she tells fantastic

stories of being wined and dined in 'cafe society,' of meeting

an elite crowd that knew gay times.

According to her account, life

was a series of cocktail parties, penthouse gatherings, and men

waiting to serve her pleasure. ** In order to give herself notoriety,

she identified herself with the German sea-raider in the last war,

Count Von Lauckner, claiming to be his cousin.

(All connection

with the Count has

been disqualified by subject's sister who maintains

thatthis was but another of subject's lies in order to gain publicity.) "

Subject claimed that from "Vince" she learned sufficient legal

jargon to enable her to talk in a lawyer's vernacular.

various aliases during this period, and under the name of Carol Hille

began representing herself to be an attorney in the Lands Division of

the Department of Justice.

In June of 1941 subject was badly sunburned

while at the beach and upon returning to her apartment fell and injured

her hip. She was hospitalized at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York for a

period of eight days.

Upon being presented a hospital bill of $160.69

she gave a bad check in payment and induced the hospital officials to

accept it upon the representation that she was an attorney in the Lands.

Division of the Department of Justice. Upon discharge from the hospital

subject went to Saratoga, New York, where she was arrested on August 21,

1941 for impersonating a Federal officer.

It is reported that from the

time of her arrest until the date of her trial on October 23, 1941, the

subject took advantage of the circumstances to obtain publicity for her-

self.

She was convicted in the Southern District of New York, on three

counts of impersonating a Federal officer and was sentenced by Judge Grover

Mo Moscowitz, on October 30, 1941, to be imprisoned for one year and a

day in the Federal Reformatory for Women, at Alderson, West Virginia, and

to be placed on probation thereafter for

a period of three years.

The following comments are made in the pre-sentence probation

report submitted to Judge Moscowitz:

Defendant herself admits having indulged in promiscuous

sex activities, but claims to have been "discreet":

in her choice of "customers." Defendant also reluc

tantly admits that she drank heavily, but is inclined

to look upon this as part of her assets as a "glamor

girl.". Defendant is completely egocentric.

She

considers herself beautiful and "photogenic" and is

proud of her attempts to live "dangerously." Her present

offense she feels is unimportant except as it contri-

butes to her publicity as a desirable figure in so-

called "cafe society."

She appears to have no intention

of altering this sordid way of life unless authoritative

means are used.

****

She drank heavily, indulged

in promiscuous sex activities and committed this offense

with no thought of consequences to herself, to her family

and upon others whom she involved..

She appears to be

utterly conscienceless and completely without remorse.

Defendant is obviously not material for probation.

She is

in need of medical and social treatment in a controlled

environment.

Following conviction the United States Attorey submitted the

usual report on convicted prisoners in which he stated that he regarded

the subject as an habitual criminal and that neither he nor the Judge

considered parole advisable in the case.

Subject was admitted to the Federal Reformatory for Women at

Alderson, West Virginia, on November 13, 1941, and in her Admission Report

it is stated:

The subject gives the impression of one who has been

a problem to her family. since childhood; who has been

willful, and has deliberately lived a daring life.

She has projected her wilfull thinking into situations,

centric, independent, unscrupulous and an impressionist.

Subject

can unmask, can discard her mannerisms and

affectations, and be an unassuming, pleasant person.

She has warped ideas on social conditions and needs in-

sight regarding her conduct, morals, and standards.

This

sentence has come as a bitter experience yet the publicity

and notoriety has been but a part of the thrilling adventure;

she fails to comprehend the seriousness of her

offense.

Until subject realizes the necessity

of working legitimately, can overcome her passion

for telling untruths, and the desire for decent

standards is aroused, it is felt that she will

continue being a social parasite.

on January 15, 1942 the subject made application for parole to

which she became eligible under the law on March I, 1942, and after a

hearing on February 4, 1942 by the Parole Board her application was

denied on March 6, 1942.

In a Progress Report to the Parole Board, dated January 31,

1942,

it is stated:

Subject has been a problem since admission. Her

many untruths and fantastic stories regarding herself

have made her very unpopular with the inmate groups.

Correction makes no impression and she profits little

by reprimand.

Her desire for attention, both from

girls as well as

the officers, makes her most annoying

at timese:

She is affable, has a sense of humor, and

can be pleasant when she drops her many affectations.

She has projected her wilful thinking into situations, and

has wished to identify herself with society and professional

circles for so long, that she is unable to shed this

cloak of imagery.

In a Special Progress Report dated May 21, 1942 it is stated:

She tells such big tales that some girl is always

calling her down and then there is an argument to

settle. No one in the dining room wishes to eat with

her because of the tall tales she tells of her past

experiences. She is courteous to the officers, but this

is merely on the surface.

She is not popular with the

group because of her concentrated efforts to make out

that she is so much better than anyone else.

In a Release Progress Report dated August 13, 1942 it is stated:

1o Custodial: Continued assignment in the Dairy until

July 19, 1942. Did not do satisfactory work and because

of her inefficiency was moved from one department to another,

but on every occasion it was still like trying to fit a

square peg into a round hole. She is capable of doing good

work, but is so enamored by her own estimated good looks and

pretty hands that her work is done in a neglectful and hap-

hazard way. When reprimanded always has her alibis fixed up,

which in her own opinion is sufficient to explain her failure.

In the cottage she is an unstable type, who cannot be depended

upon to perform any of her duties without the maximum amount

of supervision and direction.

She does not keep a neat

room and is usually untidy about her personal appearance.

She misquotes both officers and inmates, thus often causing

friction.

Cannot be depended upon for self direction, much

less to assume responsibility for others.

Warnings, repri-

mands and other forms of discipline slide right off her back

as easily as the proverbial "water off a duck's back.". She

typifies the ogomaniac.

2o Social:

*rox It is not believed that this sentence has

made much of an impression on subject. She does not like to

work and will hope to find some man to support her so that

it will not be necessary for her to work.

It is not expected

that she will ever make a satisfactory adjustment to society k

and that she will again be in difficulty with the law.

Training: --- Because of subject's difficult personality,

it was necessary to excuse her from the formal classes which

had been assigned.

4 Psychiatric: Patient is a psychopath utterly incapable

of handling her emotional reactions. Possesses no judgment

and her life will be one difficulty after another.

The subject became eligible under the law for conditional release,

from confinement on August 19, 1942, at which time she moved to her mother's

home in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

Available information indicates that after her release

from prison in August, 1942, the subject lived at the home of her

parents until October, 1942, at which time she was employed as an

inspector and later as a tool designer by the Detroit Iool Engineering

Company, Detroit, Michigan', engaged in the performance of Goverment

contracts.

While so employed, it appears that she met RoyKehristensen,

an army engineer, assigned to work at the company; that the subject

She returned to Washington, D.l. in July, 1950,

and Morgan told her he was glad National Management

did not approve her plans as she could form her own

corporation and represent the Butler Corporation of

Minneapolis, Minnesota, headed by Robert Butler, the

Ambassador to Cuba, which company was interested in

securing atomic energy contracts.

Morgan told her

not to worry about financing as that could be arranged

through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which

arrangement was later confirmed to her by the Chairman

of the R.F.C., in the presence of' Morgan..

In Morgan's

office, in the presence of Dick Paxson, she then called

the Chicago firms affiliated with National Management,

and obtained their consent to forming her own corpora-

tion, such conversations being preserved on a tape re

corder.

Morgan and a former Bureau agent took her to

Senator lydings' office around August 6, 1950; the

Senator was told of her interest in getting contracts

for atomic enerer construction and said that he would

be happy to be of any assistance he could, and his

office made an appointment for her to see a Me milliams,

head of construction for the Atomic Energy Commission.

Around Aeust 14, 1250 Ed Morgan and Senator Brien

McMahon took subject to lunch at the Occidental Restau-

ranted Washington Do, where they discussed the

award of atomic energy construction contracts to the

Butter Corporation.

Senator McMahon stated he could

be helpful because he was on the Senate Atomic Energy

Committee and his former law partner, Gordon Dean, was

chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, who he felt

would look favorably on the Butler Corporation.

The necessary papers were then prepared and

Christensen Corporation was organized under the laws

of Delaware on August 18, 1950.

Shortly thereafter

she telephoned the Butler Corporation in Minneapolis, but

Robert Butler was not in; thirty minutes later Robert

Butler called her from Cuba and said he would immediately

Morgan told "Andy" the Christensen Corporation could be

instrumental in getting Government contracts for Butler,

Corporation and indicated that because of his dealings

with Senators McMahon, Tydings and Connally, no diffi-

culty would be experienced.

That evening a further

conference was held between the same parties, attended

also by a Butler Corporation attorney from Virginia

near Washington, D.C., who was also a newspaper publisher

and bank president.

The Butler attorney remarked that

subject would have to make large campaign contributions

to the senators involved, and also discussed the fee to

be paid him. Shortly thereafter the subject went to

che Butler Corporation offices in Minneapolis and dis-

ussed the matter with Robert Butler, his son Walter

Butler, "Andy" (Longbothem)

and Hatriksen, treasurer of

the Butler Corporation, as a result of which a contract

was entered into between Christensen Corporation and

Butler Corporation under which Christensen was to act as

Washington representative for Butler in consideration

of 10% of Butler's net profits on Government contracts

procured, plus an additional 5% for expenses.

amount had been loaned to her by a friend.

The draft

was not put through for collection and she later cancelled it.

Around this same time she also entered into negotiations

for a lease of office space in the World Center Building,

Washington, DoCo, at an annual rental of $6, 600, for

which she gave a check but later recalled it when the proposed

deal fell through.

In the latter part of August 1950 she met Robert Butler

and Ed Morgan in her suite at the Mayflower Hotel,-at which

time Morgan informed her that she was to be the pay-off man.

The pay-off to Senators Connally, Tydings and Lucas was to

Brien McMahon and Tom Connally, together with paxson,

Around September 1, 1950 the subject met with Robert

Butler, Butler's secretary, Morgan and Mott in her suite

at the Mayflower Hotel for the purpose of confirming the

fee to be paid to the Christensen Corporation, at which

time Morgan said he had started the ball rolling and that

it would be just a matter of a couple of weeks until the

contracts could be signed.

Between September I and 11, 1950, Senator McMahon mailed

to subject a memorandum at her hotel

suite, in which he

summarized the procedure to be followed by Butler Corporation

in securing Government contracts on the hydrogen plant

project (included as an exhibit to the transcript. of subject's

testimony) .

On September 10 or 11, 1950, subject met Robert Butler

in his suite at the Mayflower Hotel for the purpose of securing

brochures to substantiate the construction responsibility of

Butler Corporation, at which time she gave him a memorandum,

dated September 11, 1950, setting out information to be supplied

to her by. Butler Corporation (included with the transcript of

subject's testimony as an exhibit).

Butler, his secretary;

GoA, Meyer, superintendent of Butler Corporation, and subject's

secretary, Deg Dew, were present.

Between September Il and 13, 1950, subject was told by

Morgan that it would be necessary for her to make campaign
