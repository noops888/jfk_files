up nationally.

But what he's going to try to do is

get then to make this the first thing they sponsor

Now all he's going to coneern himself with, honey, is

getting them to sponsor it.

They'll

work

You know. But the final details

weill work out if they tell us to what extent they'll

sponsor it, either from the district or nationally.

We want them to do it nationally.

Now, Mr. PEARSON feels
