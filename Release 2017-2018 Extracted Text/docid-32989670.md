The only letter which I had anything to do with clear-

Russell dated 11-1-63.

The circumstances surrounding this are

as follows:

Shortly after noon on 11-1-63 Assistant Attorney

General (AAG) Marshall furnished to me the Department's file of

correspondence with Senator Russell concerning the association

of King with Hunter Pitts O'Dell. A proposed letter to Senator

Russell for the Attorney General's (AG) signature dated 11-1-63

was attached.

Marshall said he and the AG had discussed the

proposed letter with the President.

Marshall asked us to con-

Since time was of the essence I took the proposed letter

to Mx. Belmont's office and discussed it with him.

that there were definite objections to the letter as it was written

He called the President and

Marshall and the AG tried to redraft a letter which would be in.

Each draft after written was dis-

cussed with the President telephonically by the AG and none of

the drafts were satisfactory to the President. He thereafter

decided that an innocuous letter saying nothing of substance

should be sent to Senator Russell which letter should be delivered

by AAG Marshall and me. At the time the letter was delivered

the Senator was to be furnished orally. by Marshall with detailed

information as to Martin Luther King's activities. I was merely

to assure the Senator as to the sensitive position of our informant

and the fact that information from this informant of a continuing

nature was vital to the country's welfare. After the AG had left

the city Deputy AG Katzenbach was substituted for Burke Marshall

as Katzenbach knew the Senator. An appointment to see the

Senator was made for 5:00 p.m., 11-1-63.. At this meeting Katzenbach

furnished the Senator with information concerning King and his

communist connections.

at this conference other than to confirm Katzenbach's statement

about the sensitiveness of our source.

The Senator indicated

satisfaotion with the explanation given to him by Katzenbach and

said that he did not intend to make any speech on the floor of the

"Senate about this.

The Atlanta Division has received information indicating Mr. Trotter

association not only with Hunter Pitts

Guthman came over to see me February 4, 1964,

at 4 PM. | He stated

that he had been tipped off by Schanke (phonetic) of the Saturday Evening Post -

that Cleghorn was preparing an article on Dr. Martin Luther King and that the article

would expose King's connections with the Communist Party. Guthman stated he was

quite concerned inasmuch as it appeared there had been a leak from the FBI in

connection with this matter. He told me that the Attorney General had been most

hopeful that there would be no "leaks" concerning King. Guthman quickly added that he

and the Attorney General, of course, knew that King was no good and that King

actually did have communistic connections as well as the fact that King was morally

bad. In a very apologetic tone of voice, Guthman added that the Attorney General's

record concerning King was perfectly clean and that no exposure of King could have

lany reaction whatsoever against the Attorney General.

I told Guthman he had raised several points that should be straightened

out. I mentioned that there had been no leaks from the FBI.concerning Dr. Martin

Luther King,

however, Congressmen had made speeches concerning King's background

and there had been a number of articles in newspapers. I mentioned that the Attorney

General's connections with King were none of our business, however, I could understang

why Guthman might be somewhat perturbed inasmuch as the Attorney General had mage

public statements before the Congress which indicated King had no communistic

connections.

" ENCLOSURE

Guthman stated that he wanted to repeat once again that an exposure

of King would not hurt the Attorney General in any way.. He stated his only intekes?

and the Attorney General's only interest, in keeping information concerning-King out

of the newspapers, was because both he and the Attorney General felt that FBI sources

might be unduly exposed. I made no comment to this, however, MAlerfaitfA did not

believe Guthman.

Informal Memo to Mr. Mohr

Re: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

Guthman told me he had no proof whatsoever that the FBI hag furnished 6f

intormation to the newspapers concerning King. He stated that obviously the

Department had not leaked any information inasmuch as only four individuals in

the Department, the Attorney General, Katzenbach, Assistant Attorney General Miller .

and Guthman, were the only ones who knew of King's connections with Stanley

Levinson. I told Guthman that Burke Marshall undoubtedly knew of such connections '

inasmuch as I believe he had talked to King. Guthman admitted this was true.

From the tone of Guthman's entire remarks, it would appear he had

two thoughtsin mind without actually stating such thoughts.

These thoughts were

(1) that the Attorney General is most anxious that information concerning King not

be released; and (2) that the Attorney General's connections with King, and his

defensive statements concerning King to the Congress in Civil Rights hearings,

could certainly injure the Attorney General's political chances for the future.

I made it a point to tell Guthman before he left that the Department was,

of course, very close to the Saturday Evening Post, particularly in view of the

deliberate leaks of information to the Saturday Evening Post on the Cassini and

Valachi matters. I told Guth man that if the Saturday Evening Post had obtained

(information concerning King, it would appear that they might have received such

information from the same sources where they had gotten their previous facts.

Guthman reacted to this quite anxiously and stated all this may be true, however,

under no circumstances would they give any publication the facts concerning King.

In a very hurt tone of voice, he told me once again the Attorney General was not worried

about what an exposure of fing could do to him. He stated he and the Attorney General

are only

no miners

Following my conversation with the Director at approximately 10 AM

this morning, after the Director had talked with the Attorney General, I called Guthman

and told him he apparently had misquoted my conversation with him of last night.

I asked Guthman if he had told the Attorney General, in quoting me, that i: had been •

"quite concerned about a letter the Attorney General had written in which he defended •

Martin Luther King." I told Guthman I had not mentioned any letter in my conversation .

Guthman replied that the Attorney General had gotten all mixed up in his

conversation with the Directar. Guthman admitted i made no refereate to any letter.

He also admitted I had not indicated that I was "quite concerned" in referring to the

Attorney General. Guthman explained the basis of the Attorney General's call to the

Director by stating that he and Burke Marshall had gone over to see the Attorney General

and while in his office had mentioned the information which apparently has been

accumulated by the Atlanta, Georgia, reporter. In explaining to the Attorney General,

Guthman stated he told the Attorney General he had discussed this matter with me

last night and that from the tone of my remarks, Guth man understood that (l) any'

exposure of King might possibly jeopardize FBI sources; and (2) any exposure of King®

might react publicly against the Attorney General inasmuch as the Attorney General

had defended King before the Congress. I told Guthman my remarks to him had

not meant to imply any potential embarrassment whatsoever to the Attorney General

and that I had brought the Attorney General's name into the conversation only because.

of the many newspaper articles which had been written quoting the Attorney General

and his defense of King. Guthman stated that the Attorney General was very fond

of me, and that he and the Attorney General, though they would not be around much

longer, felt their relations with my office had been or the closest nature. He stated

the Attorney General did not under any circumstances believe that my remarks had

implied possible potential embarrassment but the Attorney General had called the

Director merely to keep the record straight.

Guthman referred once again to the so-called "letter" the Attorney

General had written concerning King. He admitted once again this matter did not

come up in our conversation last night. He stated there had been a letter, however,

as a result of the Attorney General's appearance before the Magnuson Committee in

Ithe Senate. This occurred at the time of the Attorney General's appearance concerning

Civil Rights legislation. Senator Monroney had questioned the Attorney General as

to King's communistic connections, according to Guthman. The Attorney General

promised to write Senator Monroney a letter. Guthman stated that such a letter had

been prepared and had been couched in a very careful language."' He mentioned that

the letter had been cleared by Assistant Director Evans and had then been deivered

to Senator Monroney.

He stated that following delivery of this letter, either Katzenbach

or Burke Marshal along with Vir. Evans, had orally brieted Senators Russell and

Monroney regarding King's guanistic connections.

malout Evans

FACTS FROM BUFILES:

tE baron titria is this matters.

Senators Monroney and Magnuson wrote the Director in early July, •

1963, inquiring about the current racial agitation and allegations that King and other

civil rights leaders had subversive affiliations. The letter from Senator Monroney

was referred to the Attorney General on July 17, 1963, with the Senator being so

advised on the same date.. In the communication to the Attorney General, a summary

of the communist association of King was set forth, including the intluence which

Stanley Levinson, Communist Party member; had with King and Levinson's alleged

statement that "King is a whole-hearted Marxist...") On July 18, 1963, the letter

from Senator Magnuson was referred to the Attorney General along with a similar.

letter from Congressman Jeffrey Cohelan.

No record was located in Bureau files to indicate that the Attorney

General or anyone in the Department contacted us regarding what information should

be supplied to the Senators and Congressman relative to King. Mr. Evans has declared

that he most certainly did not clear any letter written to the Senators or the

Congressman on this topic.

Informal Memo to Mr. Mohr

Re: DI. Martin Luther King, Jr.

2/5/64

On July 26, 1963, newspapers throughout the country reported that

Senator Monroney had released the contents of a letter to him from Attorney General.

Kennedy stating there is "no evidence" that King or any of the other top leaders of

the civil rights groups is a communist or communist controlled. The letter revealed

the Attorney General based his statement "on all available information from the FBI

and other sources. " This letter was dated July 23, 1963. A similar letter

apparently also was sent to Senator Magnuson.

On July 27, 1963, Senator Russell of Georgia wrote the Director

inquiring about much the same matter. This letter also was referred to the Attorney

General under date of July 31, 1963. On November 1, 1963, Assistant Attorney

General Burke Marshall contacted Mr Belmont's Office relative to the letter from

Senator Russell and a subsequent letter from the Senator to the Attorney General

vigorously complaining about not having received an answer to the earlier

communication. A proposed reply to Senator Russell over the Attorney General's

signature was provided and Mr. Belmont expressed objections to the wording,

particularly since it would jeopardize a most sensitive source. Mr. Evans conferred

with the Attorney General and Mr. Marshall later on 11-1-63 and it was determined

that the draft of the letter to Russell had been approved by the President. The draft

was rephrased three times and each draft was rejectedby the President who finally

instructed that an innocuous communication be sent to the Senator and delivered

personally by Mr. Marshall and Mr. Evans with Mr. Marshall to orally brief the

Senator. Subsequently on 11-1-63, Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach and

Mr. Evans delivered the communication to Senator Russell and Mr. Katzenbach

briefed him about King. Mr. Evans merely verified that a sensitive source was

involved.

An interesting parallel to the situation occurred on August 1, 1963,

when the Attorney General gave Mr. Evans a report submitted by our New York Office

on July 22, 1963, on King asking that it be resubmitted to him with a cover memorandum

detailing exact evidence to support a statement contained therein to the effect that

King had been l described as a confirmed Marxist-Leninist as of June, 1963.") He told

Mr. Evans that if this report got up to the imi at this time he would be impeached. He

stated Assistant Attorney General Marshall had reviewed the entire report and stated

" there was nothing new concerning King's alleged communist sympathies and that it

was the timing of the report and its possible misuse which concerned him. The

statement the Attorney General objected to previously had been furnished to him on

several occasions including the letter to him on July 17, 1963, forwarding to him the

letter from Senator Monroney. The Attorney General was advised by memorandum

of August &, 1963, that "the description of King was made by Stanley Levinson first

in 1962 and again in 1963. "

those which Duckett can cause King.

Jones should have raised these objections yesterday.

We have

just obtained details of his itinerary for travel abroad which reveals

that he will leave the United States

either 9/11 or 12/64 and not

return until 9/22/64. Included in his itinerary is a visit to Rome,

Italy.

He is. to go there from Madrid, Spain, 9/18/64, and remain in

home until the morning of 9/20/64 when he will go to London, England.

He have not as yet obtained

any information indicating the

purpose of his visit to Rome, bui it is entirely likely that he may

seek and be given an audience with

the Pope. This likelihood is

clearly evidënt when one considers that King is receiving more and

more acclaim as a leader of the Negro people in this country, plus

the fact that he is a clergyman.

Further, King we know is being con-

sidered for the Nobel Peace Prize andhis receiving an audience with

the Pope would likely receive considerable publicity, especially in

Europe, further enhancing his chances for the Prize.

It would be shocking indeed for such

an unscrupulous character

as King to receive an audience with the Pope.

It is believed that if

a plan to see the Pope is in the making,

it ought to be nipped in the

We have considered different possibilities for meeting this

problem and believe that the best one would be to have Assistant

Director Malone of the New York Office personally contact Francis

Cardinal Spellman and on a highly confidential basis bring to the

Cardinal's attention (1) the fact that King is to visit Rome and the

likelihood of his receiving an audience with the Pope and (2) the

unsavory nature of King's character, both from a subversive and moral

Standpoint.

Malone should be

to impress upon the Cardinal the

likely embarrassment that may result to the Pope should he grant King

an audience and king is later discredited. In this light it would

hardly even be necessary for Malone to "suggest" what the Cardinal

should

do to forestall any possible audience. Malone should stress

the highly confidential nature of this matter with the Cardinal, who

If approved, Assistant Director Malone should personally

Reference is made to my

memorandum to you in this

dated August s1, 1904, In Which the Director approved the recommendation

to have Assistant Director Malone orally brief Francis Cardinal Spellman

concerning Martin Luther King, Ir.'s communist connections and

degenerate make-up to avoid the possibility of having the Pope graat

an audience to King in connection with his proposed visit to Rome

later this month.

Malone was briefed in this matter and told to stress two

things in his contact with Cardinal Spellman, the first being that

he should stress of course the contidential nature of our briefing

so that the Bureau would not be drawn into the picture, and, secondly,

to ascertain is Cardinal Spellman could take the necessary action

in his relationship with the Pope so that if he could not, we could

take appropriate steps through other channels.

."."1""

Malone called today and stated that he had discussed the

situation with Cardinal Spellnan over the weekend and he said that

the Cardinal took instant steps to advise the Vatican against

granting any audience to King. He stated that Cardinal Spellman

assured him that he would respect the confidential nature of the

information and added that the Cardinal vas most pleased and

ratified that the Director thought enough of him to take him into/l

his confidence and to rely upon hin to handle such a delicate matter

Cardinal Spellman is going to Rome next week to attend the Ecumenical

Council and thus will be on the scene personally and further insure

that the Pope is not placed in an embarrassing position through any

The "Washington Post and Times Herald" contained a small

article in today's edition stating that Martin Luther King, JX.,

had

announced through his office in Atlanta that he had been granted an

audience with Popeypaul Vi to take place on friday, 9-18-04, 2t

Which time he hopes to discuss the racial situation in the United

States with the Pope.

You will recall that several weeks ago, when we first

learned of King's intention to travel abroad, ve

anticipated the

possibility of King's asking for an audience

with the Pope and

arranged to have Assistant Director Nalone of the New York Office

contact Iraneis Cardinal,,Spellman to see if appropriate action could

not be taken to prevent such an audience.

Malone did briet Cardinal

Spellnan in the matter and told us the Cardinal had in fact called the

Vatican immediately aiter being contacted by Malone.

Malone vas contacted telephonically today to see if he J

could shed any lurther light on the report that King was to have an

audience with the Pope.

He contacted Cardinal Spellman's office and

was told that the Cardinal, who presently is recuperating from an

operation, had spoken personally several weeks ago by telephone to

the secretary of state at the vatican and had strongly recommended

that no audience be granted King because of very serious but highly

confidential information which had come to his attention but which he

could not discuss in detail over the telephone.

Malone was asked to determine if there possibly could have

been a slip-up so that the rope did not actually receive Cardinal

Spellman's warning.

He was advised

by Cardinal Spellman's office

that with the information being furnished to the Secretary of State

at the Vatican it would be mandatory for the Secretary of State to

furnish the information directly to the Pope and that there was every

assurance the Pope had received

the information. Cardinal Spellman's

office advised Malone today that it is possible that arrangements

such an audience had already, been made and could not be

"SWORD OF LOYOLA" AWARD DINNER

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

NOVEMBER 24, 1964

"TIME FOR DECISION!!

HH

I am deeply touched to be selected as the first

recipient of the "Sword of Loyola." It is very difficult to express

happiness in words, but assure you I will always cherish the great

honor you have paid me tonight. I am humbled by the meaning of this

distinguished Award.

Saint Ignatius Loyola belongs to that glorious band of

men who make the history others write. And he is an enduring

symbol of fierce dètermination and the dauntlessness of soul which

swing the human race a little nearer to the ultimate fulfillment of

that divipe purpose toward which the whole of creation moves.

It is most fitting that you should establish this Award

in the name of a man who turned aside from narrow self-interest to

dedicate his life and his sword to God! By your action you remind

the world that Saint Ignatius proved there is sufficient divine power

in the soul of each of us to move the universe--if we will use it.

I am convinced there is a compelling necessity for us

to make that effort now.

This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for dissemi .

nation outside your Committee.

Its use is limited to official proceedings oy

your Committee and the content may nut be disclosed to unauthorized person

nel without the express approval of the FBl.

To every man and every nation there comes a time

when decisions must be made about grave problems. Further delay

in seeking solutions can bring disaster. That time has come forthe

United States.

The moment has arrived when we must face realis-

tically the startling fact that since 1958 crime in this country has

increased five times faster than our population growth! Serious

crimes-murder, forcible rape, robbery, burglary, aggravated

assault, automobile theft--have mounted steadily since the end of

World War II. In 1951 these crimes for the first time topped the

one million mark, and more than two and one-quarter million

serious crimes were reported during 1963.

Even more ominous is the fact that this terrifying

spiral in crime has come about through a growing wave of youthful

criminality across the Nation. Last year for the fifteenth consecutive

year crimes involving our young people increased over the previous

year. For all serious crimes committed in the United States in 1963,

youthful offenders were responsible for a staggering 72 percent of the

total arrests for these crimes!

What a grim and unhappy commentary on the moral

climate of this great Nation! The moral strength of our Nation has

decreased alarmingly. We must return to the teachings of God if we

are to cure this sickness.

These shocking statistics together with the public's

apparent indifference to them are indicative of the false morality we

are tolerating today. It is a false code which is based on the worship

of things of man's own creation. It is as imperfect and feeble as man

himself! However captivating to the senses, this type of moral climate

cannot give the support nor the strength which is so vital to our national

survival. This breakdown in our, moral standards can only render us

impotent as a people and as a Nation.

Law and order are the foundations" upon which successful

government must stand. Without law and order, society will destroy

itself.

HY 55278

DocId: 32889670 Page 64

## Page 65

We must never forget that government cannot favor

one group or one special interest over its duty to protect the rights

of all citizens. We must constantly guard government against the*'

pressure groups which would crush the rights of others under heel'in

order to achieve their own. ends.

The law of the land is above any individual. All must

abide by it. If we short cut the law, we play a dangerous game which

can only result in total defeat for all of us because if we destroy our

system of government by law, we destroy our only means of achieving

a stable society.

It is a great misfortune that the zealots or pressure groups

always think with their emotions, seldom with reason. They have no com-

' punction in carping, lying and exaggerating with the fiercest passion.

They cry liberty when they really mean license!

Justice has nothing to do with expediency. It has nothing

to do with temporary standards. We cannot, and will not, permit the

FBI to be used to superimpose the aims of those who would sacrifice

the very foundations on which our government rests! I take humble

pride in emphatically stating here tonight that as long

as I am Director

of the FBI, it will continue to maintain its high and impartial standards

of investigation despite the hostile opinions of its detractors. Further-

more; the FBI will continue to be objective in its investigations and will

stay within the bounds of its authorized jurisdiction regardless of

pressure groups which seek to use the FBI to attain their own selfish

aims to the detriment of our people as a whole.

Unfortunately and too often humanity, if left to itself,

moves along the line of least resistance.. That is the reason we make

such slow progress, and why we are prone to wait for pathfinders to

blaze the way for us to follow. Each of us hopes that beyond the despair

and darkness of today there is something better in store for tomorrow.

It will be tragic if nothing but hope is brought to bear on the problem of

- crime in the United States today.

We must have men and women with ideals, with faith

and hope and determination who will transmute noble purpose into

accomplished action. If we are to reverse the crime picture in this

country, we must make a sustained effort to stir the complacent ones

to awareness.

We mollycoddle young criminals and release unreformed

hoodlums to prey anew on society. The bleeding hearts, particularly

among the judiciary, are so concerned for young criminals that they

• become indifferent to the rights of law-abiding citizens.

We must have judges with courage and a high sense of

their duty to protect the public and to adequately penalize criminals if

we are to stop the spread of serious and dangerous crimes against

society.

We must adopt a most realistic attitude toward this

critical problem. We have tried the lenient approach and it has failed.

It is the fashion among many to sneer at ideals, to flout

them with derisive jeers as the insubstantial dreams of the naive, and

to scornfully prophesy that most men will abandon their ideals as

useless encumbrances in the race for wealth and fame. The cynics

are too often right, but the fault is not with the ideal--remember that.

A worthwhile ideal may be difficult, but it is never impossible, of

attainment.

I believe in the omnipotence of the human spirit. Man

has repeatedly shown that he can both make and master circumstances.

It will take this type of determination on the part of the majority of our

ii people if we are to halt increasing numbers of our young people from

swelling the crime statistics columns each year. We badly need a

moral reawakening in every home in our Nation.

The voices of temperance, logic and decency must

speak out. Terrorism cannot be tolerated in a free society. Hate,

terror and lawlessness are not the American way.

I trust you will give consideration to my remarks and

not dismiss them as typical of the traditional age-old lament about the

moral climate of one's native land. We are courting disaster if we do

' not soon take some positive action against the growing moral deteriora-

tion in this land.

It is a grievous trend wnich is being steadily reflected in

the attitude of contempt which many of our people have for the values

which made this Nation great.

Today, patriotism seems to be out of style. Those

who express their love-of country are often looked upon as paranoiac

patriots or right-wing extremists.

Д Д

Let me quote from an article which appeared in a

recent issue of a student publication of one of our Midwestern colleges.

Entitled "Nix Patriotism," this article stated, "Patriotism is an

emotion that is marked by ignorance, stupidity, prejudice, autism,

fear and hostility."

We can only pray that this undesirable trend which is

evidenced among students in all too many of our colleges and universities

can be reversed before it is too late.

This attitude, can be seen in the widespread public

indifference concerning the real threat of world communism. The

philosophy of communism flourishes best in an environment where per-

sonal responsibility and self-discipline have been undermined by

immorality, materialism and expediency.

Its duplicity is difficult for young Americans to compre-

hend. If our young citizens turn an objective, analytical searchlight on

this ideology and its organizational arms, they will understand commu-

nism for what it is--a materialistic, godless dogma dedicated to world

domination.

When man places himself above the law and bases his

decisions on his,own selfish interests, he aids the communists'

relentless efforts to destroy the ideals of our civilization. He contributes

heavily to reducing life to the code of the jungle, by making it easier for

communism to spread its deadly doctrines, terror and the brutalization

of man. What Ignatius Loyola taught, communism seeks to destroy.

The man who has no objective values by which he judges

his actions--who allows his passions to run wild, unchecked by a moral

" standard of what is right--that man is surely risking the loss of his

immortal soul.

Faith in man cannot exist without faith in God. Faith in

God takes root and grows strong only when it is expressed in service

and good works.

It seems we are never converted in mass to any

genuine reform in society, science, religion, morals or government.

There must be a beginning and the time is now.

America stands at the crossroads of destiny. It is a

common destiny in which we shall all finally stand or fall together.

Though we contest with utter vigor for the prevalence of whatever

attitudes and policies may possess our souls, may we ever remember

that we finally must be all for one and one for all against the vicissitudes

of fortune--and perhaps against the world.

We are still capable of producing leaders who have the

power to move, quicken and transform their environment, and to awaken

an answering thrill of appreciation and support in us who read or hear of

their struggles and achievements.

I sincerely hope the "Sword of Loyola" will mark the

beginning of a new and enlightened era in the United States.

Man is blessed with the liberty to choose between opposing

factors, between action and inaction, between good and evil, between God

and the Devil. Surely our immediate situation requires an endeavor by

man to raise himseli above ordinary standards to a higher degree of •.

SUBJECT: PRESENTATION OF "SWORD OF LOYOLA" AWARD

TO THE DIRECTOR

NOVEMBER 24, 1964

Merlibership.

Loyola University of Chicago is initiating an annual award, known as the

"Sword of Loyola," which is to be given to an American of any religion whose services

have been outstanding, dedicated and courageous. The actual award will be a scale mocel

of the original sword of Saint Ignatious Loyola, who gave up the profession of being a

soldier to found the Jesuit Order. He dedicated his sword to God, hence the symbolism

of the award, which is the highest honor to be presented by the University.

It will be given at the annual award dinner of the Medical School of Loyola

University, which is attended by approximately 1, 100 individuals who pay $250 each.

¡The funds are used to defray the deficit of the medical school. Over a quarter of a

million dollars is raised each year. The affair is reputed to be the main social and

charitable event of the year, with the leading social and business leaders of Chicago in

attendance. It is reported the guest list is usually a vertable "Who's Who" of Chicago.

This year's diner will be held in the grand ballroom of the Conrad Hilton Fotal on

11-22-64, the Tuesday before Thanksgiving. It will be formal and among those attending

will be His Eminänce, Albert Cardinal Meyer, Archbishop of Chicago, Illinois

Governor Otto Kerner, Jr., and the Major d Chicago, Richard J. Daley.

The Trustees of Loyola designated a jury to make the selecton'for the

award. This group was composed of Chief Judge William J. Campbell, U. S. District

Court, Chicago;, Father James F. Maguire, President of Loyola; T. J. Connelly,

Chicago industrialist; Charles Kerwan, Chicago investment broker; Don McNeill,

Chicago radio personality and Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg. They have

proposed the Director as the first recipient of the "Sword of Loyola.

Father Maguire said the purpose of this presentation was not one of

trying to get Mr. Hoover to Chicago ior a speech. All that would be expected are

some appropriate acceptance remarks and any comments which Mr. Hoover may feel

suitable to the occasion, not to run more than ten minutes.

M. A. Jones to DeLoach memo

Re: Presentation of "Sword of Loyola" Award

Judge Campbell has expressed the earnest desire that the Director give favorable

consideration to receiving this award and asked the SAC of Chicago to convey his persomal

request to Mr. Hoover that he accept it. If Mr. Hoover can give a favorable reply,

a delegation probably composed of Father Maguire, T. J. Connelly and, possibly,

Juage Campbell will visit Washington to formally invite Mr. Hoover to become the

first recipient of this honor.

The SAC also wishes the Director to know that he and the Chicago Office

would be most honored to have him accept the award.. It is anticipated the office will

be in its new quarters at the time of the formal presentation, and its personnel would

deem it a great honor if Vir. Hoover could visit them while he is in the city. The SAC

has also advised he will personally advise Judge Campbell, on behalf of the award jury,

of the Director's decision in this matter.

INFORMATION IN BUFILES:

Judge Campbell is on the Special Correspondents' List and is known to

the Director on a first-name basis. Don McNeill is known to the Director on a first-

name basis and our relationship with him has been a cordial one. He met Mr. Hoover

and was conducted on a special tour on 12-8-61. Mr. McNeill was a member of t e

Board of Judges of the Mutual Of Omaha which selected the Director as recipient of the

Criss Award. Mayor Daley issued a proclamation designating 5-10-60, as J. Edgar

Hoover Day in Chicago in commemoration of the Director's 36th Anniversary. We have

some derogatory information concerning Justice Goldberg, much of which he verified

when he contacted a Bureau official in 1955. He was affiliated with the Chicago Chapter

of the National Lawyers Guild; however, he claimed, and the record tends to indicate,

he opposed communist domination of that organization. During the FBI investigation of

him for the position of Secretary of Labor, numerous high-ranking and responsible

individuals vouched for his character and loyalty. Our relationship withhim has been

cordial and he was a graduation speaker at the 68th Session of the National Academy.

We have had previous cordial correspondence with Mr. Connelly and with Father

Maguire. No record in Bufiles concerning Charles Kerwan.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Director indicate his desires with respect to this matter.

The Director is correct. The only fending speaking engagement

for Mr. Hoover at the present time is the one on December 12th at the

Pennsylvania Society dinner in New York City.

What you, Mr. DeLoach, had in mind in suggesting a declination

"in view of other speech commitments" was the close proximity of the

November 24th invitation to the commitment on December 12th. This would

mean two speeches within a period of 3 weeks.

Confidential source one advised on March 30,

4. 1964,

that on that date RUT BAILEY (an emplovee of the southern

Christian Leadershit conference in New York City was in

contact with EDWIN SMITH (Secretary to the Program Director

Southern Christian-Leadership-Conference-Atlanta-leorgi; ).

BATEY toid SMITH that she had received a letter from RALPH

BERNAY Greasurer of Southern Christian Leader

Conterence.)n

lated March 27, 1904, advising that her services

would no longer be needed after

March 15,: 1964.

BAILEY waS

at a loss

to understand why she would receive a letter

terminating her employment 15 days after the termination date.

According to the source,

BAILEY said the letter was to the

effect that Southern Christian Leadership Conference had asked

CLARENCE GONES to notify BAILEY of her termination but she

"had not heard from JoNES.

source one also stated that BalLly then went into

an attack of the "brass" at Southern Christian Leadership

Conference stating that STANLEY LEVISON was running Reverend

MARSIN LUSHER KING,

JR., although KING had been warned to

stay away from him.

•BAILEY tOId SMITH that "they" have a

bIe fIle on LEvISoN but theying on "OD" (phonetic): BAILEY

said that she believes

should have something on "oD"

BAILEr said that she wanted to talk to ABERNATHY about this

termination of her employment.

Confidential Source Two stated on March 31, 1964,

that on that date CLARENCE JONES Of New York City, RALPH

ABERNAWHY and MARIIN IJIHER KING, JR., of the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference Office in Atlanta, discussed

RUTH BAILEY'S dismissal at the Southern Christian Leadership

According to source two they all admitted she was

very dedicated to the cause but that since: HUNCER PITIS

'DeLL had left BAILEY had had no guidance.

Source Iwo also stated. on March 31, 1964, that

JONES told KING and ABERNATHY that there was a possibility

that the New York Office of Southern Christien Leadership

Conference would move into the space with the Gandhi Society.

should move the office out of the Harlem District, ox-not.

source Two also said that on March 31, 1964,

JONES, ABERNATHY and KINC discussed the strong possibility

thât the current Civil Rights

filibuster in the J. S.

Senate would bring out the "JACK O'DELI, and Highlander

business"

(This apparently refers to the fact that HUNTER

PIUS C'DELL was formerly an official In Southern Christian

Leadership Conference).

JONES told KING that he now

sees the wisdom of KINd's decision to hold off on hiring

•SAYARD

eStiN for a while.

Source two said that during this same conversation

on March 31, 1964, KING asked JONES for the $2500 that the

santha society owes Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

KING mentioned the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

treasury was very low at the present time.

JOHN M. MATTER

SPECIAL AGENT, GS-14

PART I - GENERAL COMMENTS

SA Matter is rated as excellent in personal appearance and in regard

to his personality and over-all effectiveness of contacts. In his assignments

he has daily contact with Government officials outside of the Bureau, thereby

affording many opportunities to properly represent the Bureau. SA Matter

has a driving aggressive enthusiasm toward his assigned work and the over-all

work of the Bureau.

SA Matter is mature and experienced. He can handle complex

investigative assignments. There are no limitations as to general or special

assignment. He is carried on limited duty because of a previous mycardial

infarction.

He is presently precluded from participation in raids, defensive

tactics, firearms and strenuous exertion. In this connection it is noted that

his overtime exceeded the Division average on 12 of the past 18 months. During

the past year he took but 2 hours of sick leave.

During this period, SA Matter exercised primary responsibilities

in the area of the countermeasure program, security checks, relocation site

problems, special committee on countermeasures, sound recordings, alarm

systems and budget matters. In addition, he had over-all supervisory

responsibilities in the broad category of field sound recorders, technical

manuals, sound training, infrared devices and related electrical matters.

SA Matter's over-all supervision of these matters is rated as excellent.

Of particular note were his many countermeasure installations for

high Government officials during this period as well as numerous security

surveys, design projects, and tape recordings. In addition his achievements in

the area of training were of significance during the rating period.

SA Matter, having a scientific degree and a law degree, is particularly

well suited to his assignment in the Laboratory. He

continues to be a valuable employee in view of his record and special

qualifications. His performance is rated as satisfactory from an over-all

standpoint.

JOHN M. MATTER

SPECIAL AGENT, GS-14

PART I - SPECIFIC COMMENTS

Justification for Any Minus Ratings Given

SA Matter has been on limited duty during the entire rating period.

He is not rated as satisfactory in the category of physical fitness

for this reason. His over-all rating has taken this into account

and he has been rated as satisfactory overall since he cannot

perform all of the duties required of a Special Agent. It is

noted that SA Matter's overtime exceeds the Division average

more than half the time. He continues to be a very valuable

Special Agent employee.

Experience and Ability as Inspector's Aide

JOHN M. MATTER

SPECIAL AGENT, GS-14

PART I - GENERAL COMMENTS

SA Matter continues to be rated excellent as regards personal appearance

and over-all effectiveness of contacts made on behalf of the Bureau. His develop-

ment of sources of information is regarded as outstanding. This supervisor's work

places him in contact with high Government officials where his ability to properly

carry the particular technical liaison program through to a logical conclusion has

been amply demonstrated during this period. SA Matter's assignments are con-

sistently approached with aggressiveness and a strong desire to place Bureau

interests foremost.

This supervisor is experienced and capable of handling complex field

investigative matters.

He has no limitations as to special or general assignment.

. It is noted that SA Matter continues to be carried on limited duty because of a

previous mycardial infarction suffered in 1957. Since that time, he has been

precluded from participation in raids and use of firearms. In connection with

te performance of this supervisor, it is noted that his daily overtime has been

above the Division average for eleven of the past fifteen months, averaging two

and one-half hours per day during the rating period.

During this period, SA Matter was assigned primary supervisory responsi-

bilities in the broad area of sound recording and related matters. These included

alarm devices, the countermeasure program to protect telephones of Government

officials against compromise as listening devices, electrical special assignments,

sound recording equipment for the field, security surveys and participation on a

special technical surveillance countermeasures committee. In addition, training,

special recordings, field surveys, development work and case examinations are

responsibilities of this category.

From a technical standpoint, SA Matter has produced outstanding work,

some of it unique in character, performed under considerable pressure on

numerous occasions during this period.

On January 21, 1964, SA Matter was commended by the Director for

his competent performance in an investigation of a delicate nature.

SA Matter, having a scientific and law degree, is particularly well suited

to his current assignment.

He continues to be a valuable employee. His

performance is being rated as satisfactory from an over-all standpoint.
