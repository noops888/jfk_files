Rerep SA VERNON G. WALTERS, Detroit, 10/15/63.

Since submission of rerep, Dept. Attorney WILLIAM FRENCH has

not been in Detroit.

Through his office at Detroit, FRENCH

telephonically requested a preliminary inquiry regarding an

allegation received by him from a Department source. This

source had hearsay information that during the FDIC examination

formation tha

of Public Bank (which provided the basis for investigation in

captioned case) a substantial loan from Public Bank to Redford

Iron Works, Inc., (RIW) was in serious difficulty; and that

JOSEPH F. VERHELLE, president of Public Bank, allegedly caused

HARRY S. LEVINE of Ewald Steel Sales & Supply Co. to assume

liability for the loan.

LEVINE allegedly did so with the

understanding that it was just for the duration of the FDIC

examination; but he was not later relieved of this liability

by VERHELLE.

FRENCH requested inquiry to determine whether there appears

to be any basis for the above allegations and whether there

was any connection indicated with the matters under investi-

gation in this case,

Review of the FDIC report of examination of Public Bank and

other records indicated extensive business dealings with Public

Bank by RIW, Ewald Steel Sales & Supply Co., LEVINE; and IRWIN

J. KASOFF,

an associate of LEVINE.

Former president of RIW,

CHARLES A. HORIST, advised LEVINE and KASOFF appeared to have

influence at Public Bank; and VERHELLE and JEROME J. ZIELINSKI,

a vice president of Public Bank, may have helped them get

control of RIW.

No connection was

indicated with

other loans previously investigated in this case.

Report will follow.
