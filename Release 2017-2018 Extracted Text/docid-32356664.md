MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Traces on Santos TRAFFICANTE

1.

There is no official 201 file on TRAFFICANTE.

Following are extracts from references

in Agency files:

a .

Memo for the Record dated 6 March 1964 on

AMNIP-1 (A-1) with

exchanging dollars for Cuban pesos.

(-2 with a on pesos and by.

1. This memo concerns the involvement of

a group in Cuba headed by SANTI, in

A-l's involvement

was by invitation of SANTI who turned out to be G-2. SANTI

told

A-l that they would have to be on the alert because

of other important group, also involved in money changing,

directed by Evaristo GARCIA, then in Miami and a friend of

Cuban gambler fnu SANTOS Trafficante (sic); Roberto sUsI;

and fnu LEAL, with whom they would sooner or later have

trouble.

Möney was sent to Miami by diplomats accreditod to

Cuba in the false bottom of a cardboard suitcase made by

SANTI's

younger brother in the latter's office in "old

Havana."

The suitcase was received in Miami by a person

of confidence who had a passport and a visa. Travel by

plane and permission to leave the country was obtained by

SANTI through the Chief of the Department of Technical

Investigations (DTI) of the Department of Investigation of

the Rebel Army (DIER) at the International Airport at

Rancho Boyeros. Suitcases with false bottoms for the other

groups were also made by SANTI's brother as he was the only

one who could make them with perfection. A crisis did

the perfect ther

develop between SANTI and the other groups, because they

diverted money exchanges to themselves.

2. SANTI reportedly left Cuba on a Greek shir

(date unknown). In October 1962 SANTI had reportedly just

opened a-store in New Orleans, Louisiana.

A-l learned from

a person in Miami in 1963 that SANTI had said he was prepar-

ing a false bankruptsy for his store in New Orleans.

SANTI

also reportedly declared a false bankruptsy for a store he

owned in Caracas, Venezuela, when he returned to Cuba

following the downfall of Batista.

3.

Members of SANTI's group were Danilo

PARADELA, Enu GASTON, Alberto MONTOTO, Leonel GOMEZ, fnu

ROSELL (police official and Cuban smuggler), Rebel Army

Capt. Boris, commander of the troops assigned at the

Hippodrome of Marianao, another Rebel Army Capt., name

unknown, and a Lt. named "Robertico" lnu.

4. SANTI is said to have arranged for the

arrest of Roberto SUSI, a member of an opposition group,

who was accused of being a contact for the counterrevolut-

ionary group and the CIA, allegedly because SUSI had been

a boy friend of SANTI's wife before her marriage to SANTI.

A-1 said that SANTI was very closely

connected with the Cuban gambler, fnu SANTOS Trafficante (sic).

Also, that SANTI was an unscrupulous character who would

do almost anything for a dollar, and was fearful for his

life.

A-1 said SANTI could be made to talk by being

threatened with the thought of going to prison. In 1964

SANTI's brothers and parents lived in the U.S.

to remain in Cuba and was prepared to cooperate with the

Castro Government in order to continue business as usual.

One person in the G-2 most willing to become involved with

be useful to support G-2 operations in the Miami area.
