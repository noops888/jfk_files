SUBJECT: Lee Harvey Oscald Case: Briefing of Congressman

Richard Ichora,

 Yay 107?

1. T. Joseph O'Neill, Office of the Legislativa

Counsel, presented Nr. Arthur Dooley, who furnished the

exhibits requested by the Congressman, and answered his

questions as follows:

committee. He wanted io know if "during CIA's investigation

of Oswald when he was

in Mexico" ve develoned any evidence

of a conspiratorial relationship between the Soviets and

Oswald either through

our coverage of the Embassr or

outside meetings. He

specifically referred to Sovict

consular officials Pavel Antonovich Yatskov and Valeriv

Vladimirovich Kostikov, one or both of whom Oswald

contacted at the

Soviet Embassy. (Both Yatskov and Kostikov

were identified in the Commission's Report as consular

officials and KGB representatives.) I told him that CIA

did not have Oswald under investigation when he was in

Mexico City; directed his

attention to the pertinent

exhibit; and

explained

that the KGB affiliations of the

two soviets were supplied by CIA experts who were avare

of their activities

and not by anything said

Dy Oswald in the evidence compiled by us. Mr. Ichord

examined the exhibit,

noted that Oswald's short conversations

only related to securing visas; indicated that he had been

misinformed; and said that he had no further questions to

ask on this

point.

3. He said that his question was sparked by Bernard

•ensterwald, or. a tormer constituent, about whon he

new very little when he requested the documents. Since

then he has learned of Fenstervald's dubious credentials

as an expert on the assassination and of his association

with Jim Garrisson and others of questionable repute.

I detailed our own difficulties with Fenstervald, his

insistence that we are hiding something, and how,

as

Executive Director of the Committee to Investigate

Assassinations, he has been pressing us to release

our

classified documents under

• threat of invoking the

Freedom of Information Act.

refuted

the assorted

allegations regarding

this nicture which vore concrated by Edward Fostein,

Lane,

volunteered his name. One of Garrisson's charges

was that

Cald was a CIA agent and that we cut him out of the

picture. I took the occasion to stress that Oswald was

not a CIA agent and that ve never had anything to do with

5. I mentioned that when the President's

Commission

came into existence Mr. Helms issued specific instructions

to cooperate fully with the Commission and to give it

complete access

any information bearing

on the assassina

tion; that Commission menvers, at Mr. Helm's invitation

visited our Mexico City station for

an on-the-scene

briefing and

inspection. I told him

that we have not

released exhibits relating to Oswald's visits to the Soviet

and Cuban Embassies, because the sources of the above

information are extrenely sensitive and still productive.

Mr. Ichord fully agreed on this score and complimented us

on

the extent of our coverage.

f..

Mr. Ichord asked what stops CIA was taking to

declassify its other documents. I

told him of the required

five year cycle (one coming un shortly), the review

process, our interim releases, and CIA's desire to release

as quickly as the need for protecting them subsides.

I pointed out that most of

our material consists of "nut

corplaints':

significance

etc; which have no security

rumors, cossalid he embarassing to innocent

persons; disclose a productive and friendly foreign source;

or acknowledge CIA's presence abroad where diplomatically

this

would be inadvisable.

cited our experience with the

"crank call" that originated in|

in 1968 we tried to declassify this exhibit but

security officials objected on the grounds that it would

publicly acknowledge ClA presence on their soil

and perhaps

str unwarranted controversy.I stated that despite the

above-type problems we gradually have been declassifying

CId's material, sanitizing exhibits, as necessary to

protect our

sources and

methods.

7. I mentioned in passing, that tvo other things

beyond

our control have contributed to the misconceptions

over

our exhibits:

A)The inadvertent release by National

chives of the master list of numberer exhibits shortly

after the demise of the President's Commission without

distinguishing betveen overt and classified items; and

B) the fact that many exhibits bear different numbers

but are interrelated, thus giving a

false impression that

there are more exhibits than is the case. The release

of the

of the master list without the accompanying documents

caused much

apprehension and misinterpretation, particularly

among assassination "buffs" and Agency critics. I cited "

"Oswald and the U-?" entry which was widely exploited

until ve declassified tie document a couple of years ago..

8. Nir. Ichord asked if any. CIA members served on

the President's Commission. I said no, but mentioned that

former DCI Allen Dulles

was on the Commission. He

then

turned to the makeup of the Commission staff and how it

was chosen. I replied that we were not really competent

to comment

on how it was chosen but the staff consisted

largely of attorneys of varied

political and ethnical

backgrounds from widely separated parts of the country;

that,

fron my observation,

the Conmission was impressively

organized and a highly notivated, hard vorking group.

9. Mr. Ichord stated that he had no further questions

to ask: and thanked us for easing his mind. We offered

to

produce any other documents he might wish to see. Mr. Ichord

replied that this would not be necessary. He returned our

exhibits and told us to consider the matter closed.
