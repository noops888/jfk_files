1• IN THE FACE OF MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT ALVARADO IS FABRICATING HIS

STONY OF SEEING OSWALD TAKE MONEY IN THE CUBAN EMBASSY• URGE YO! FOLIO

UP WITHI

WE FIND IT INCREDIBLE THAT THE CUEANS WOULD

BRIZF AND PAY AN ASSASSIN IN FRONT OF A NIC INTERLOPER. WE THINK IT

POSSIBLE OR EVEN LIKELY THAT HE HAS BEEN IN AND OUT OF THE CUBAN EMBASSY

AS A MIC AGENT TRYING TO INFILTRATE CUBA AND HAS PICKED UP THE NAMES AND

FACES THERE IN SO DOING-

ALL HE WAS SAID ABOUT OSWALD HE COULD HAVE

GOTTEN FROM THE NEUSPAPERS, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN INCORRECT ITEMS SUCH AS

HIS STATEMENT THAT OSWALD WORE GLASSES®

THE FACT THAT ALVARADO IS A CALM, NICES AND INTELLIGENT YOUNG MAN

DOES NOT MEAN HE IS NOT A FABRICATOR.

FYI WE AND OTHER AGENCIES ARE

BEING FLODDED BY FABRICATIONS ON THE GPFLOOR CASE FROM SEVERAL CONTINENTS

SOME ORIGINATING WITH PEOPLE ON THE FRINGES OF THE INTELLIGENCE BUSINESS®

SUCH FABRICATIONS ARE NOT USUALLY DONE FOR NONEY BUT OUT OF SICKLI

PANCE AND A DESIRE TO CZI INTO THE INTELLIGENCE GAME®

WE DO NOT THINK IT A REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE THAT

BOTH DORTICOS AND

ALVARADO TALK ABOUT MONEY PAID TO OSWALD•

__FOR ONE THING, PAY FOR AN

ASSASSIN IS A FACTOR WHICH IMMEDIATELY

RISES IN THE MIND OF EXPERT AND

LAYMAN ALIKE•

SECONDLY, DORTICOS MAY HAVE HEARD THROUGH SOME RUSSIA!

OP. CUBAN SOURCE IN THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT THAT DURAN WAS ASKED WITHER

THE CUBANS PAID OSWALD FOR THE ALLEGED ASSIGNMENT•

WHILE WE DO NOT INSIST THAT ALVARADO'S STORY IS BEYOND ALL BELIEF

WE DO URGE THAT MEXI PLACE IT AND ALVARADO UNDER THE MOST SEARCHING

SCRUTINY• HIS INTERROGATORS HUST PRODE DEEPLY INTO HIS MAKE-UP AND

LEAD HIM BACK THROUGH THE THROUGHT PRECESSES WHICH MAY HAVE LED HIM TO

MAKE THIS POSSIDLE MIS-STEP.

1 SECURING CONFESSIONS DE FARRICATIONE

A SIMPAMLIIC ATTITUDE, STRESSING AWARENESS OF THE SEVERE MENTAL STRAIN

THE SUBJECT MUST RE UNDERS AND WITY GENEROUS RECOGNITION OF HIS "DASIC-

ALLY FINE MOTIVATION," COUPLED WITH PROMISES OF FACE-SAVING SECRECI
