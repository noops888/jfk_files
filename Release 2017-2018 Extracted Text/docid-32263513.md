Summary of Contact:

On 5/29/78 Ms. Thomas was interviewed at her home on 50th Street NW by Dan

Hardway and Harold Leap. Ms. Thomas said that her husband, Charles W.

Thomas had committed suicide in 1971.

Ms Thomas was questioned about Elena Garro de Paz.

She said that she was

familiar with the story and only wondered why we had not contacted her earlier.

She said that Elena is now in hiding and has always been a little bit wild.

Ms. Thomas was adament in denying that Elena was at all "crazy"

Ms. Thomas

believes very strongly that Elena had to have had some basis for her reporting.

Ms. Thomas said that she believed Elena's allegation about Duran being

Oswald's lover because Elena was not the type of woman who took part in

gossip,

"women talk'' or stories about other women.. Ms. Thomas said that

it was her husband, not Elena, who had figured out the correct dates of:

the party from Elena's datebook. • Ms. Thomas does not know where this date-.

book is now. Ms. Thomas said that Elena was very bright and "knew too much"

When

asked

why she knew too much, Ms. Thomas hedged and did not divulge

any specifics.

Ms. Thomas said that their last contact with Elena was

in 1968. At that time Elena called her husband from New York. She (Elena)

said that she

was being held at a hotel against her will and asked Charles

Thomas for help.

Thomas

tried to help her. Cynthia does not remember

all the

things that her husband did to try to help, but does remember that

he called Octavio Paz.

She was sure that Thomas took other actions at

the time but cannot remember them. She said that he always kept extensive

notes and she would try to locate his notes from this incident. After

contacting Octavio, Charles Thomas tried to locate Elena at the hotel she

claimed to be at. When he called there he was told that she had checked

out in

a hurry, leaving

her luggage behind.

Ms. Thomas said that Elena had trusted Charles Thomas and had taken

him into her inner circle of friends. Most of Elena's friends were Mexican

intellectuals and leftests, hence the value of this contact to the CIA.

Ms. Thomas

said that the CIA used Thomas to get information from these

people and that Charles Thomas willingly cooperated in this effort.

Ms. Thomas offered two reasons why Charles Thomas' report of Elena's

allegations recieved the type of response from the American officials that

it did. The first reason was that Win Scott was very close to President

Diaz Ordaz and that this, in some way, may have been the reason for suppressing

Elena's story. The second reason

that she offered was that Ferris, the

Legal Attache at the time, resented someone from the political section

poking around in his business.

Ms. Thomas said that her husband had always "bailed out" the CIA

by providing them

with the information that he obtained. She said, because

of this the CIA was always trying to "pick up" their expenses but they

always declined the CIA's offers.

The Thomas' left Mexico City in 1967. At that time a CIA officer

took over Charles Thomas' contacts. Ms. Thomas said that the officer

was named Stanley Watson and that he was now retired and living in

Cuenavaca,

Mexico.

Ms. Thomas termed Waton

a "bungling manipulator".

She said that Waston was involved in some way that she is not sure of

in the Student riots in Mexico in 1968. She speculated that he may

have been involved in inciting them. When asked specifically whether

Watson had taken

over the contact with Elena in 1967 Ms. Thomas

responded affirmatively.

Not long after the last contact with Elena in 1968, Charles Thomas

learned that he was being ''selected out" of the Foreign Service. The

reason for his selection out was that he had not recieved a promontion

in the required manner. After his selection

out Mr. Thomas applied for

over 2000 jobs. He remained unemployed nevertheless until his suicide

in 1971. It is Ms. Thomas' beleif that he was blackballed. Ms. Thomas

provided an article about her husband that appeared in the Washington

Evening Star. (Copy attached.) She also showed us a copy of an article

that appeared in Time magazine, p. 20, on 11/15/71.

After Charles' suicide, Cynthia took actions to get her husband

reinstated in the Foreign Service. As a result of this she obtained

a job in the Foreign Service. William Fulbright and the Senate Foreign

Relations Committee held hearings on the case.

Most of Charles' documents

were turned over to the SFRC. Mrs. Thomas dealt with Robert Dockery (phon.).

at the SFRC. After holding hearings the SFRC introduced a private bill

which reinstated Charles Thomas. (Copies of report and bill attatched:)

Ms. Thomas said that she took the matter to the Foriegn Relations Committee

only after she had tried to get relief through State Department channels.

She said that her case was handled at the State Department by Wilmet Hastings,

an assistant to Eliot Richardson,

and John McCumber.

Ms. Thomas said that

it was McCumber who offered her

the job with the Foreign Service, and that

he is now associated with the Museum of Modern Art.

She said that he has

always had strong

• ties to the CIA.

Ms. Thomas suggested two other people who might know something about

Charles Thomas and Elena Garro de Paz's allegations. Wally Stewart was the

Political Consul in Mexico City at the time and all of Charles Thomas'

reports went to him. He was Thomas' direct superior. Ms. Thomas said

that he was also

a very good friend of the Legal Attache. The other person

Clare Boonstra was also

a political officer and was aware of the

discussions with Elena. Ms. Thomas thinks that Stewart is retired in

Mexico and that Boonstra is retired somewhere in Florida.
