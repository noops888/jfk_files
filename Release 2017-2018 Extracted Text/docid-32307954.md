informant was pot pinpointed at this point as to enact

spelling of names or as to the names of all initiates.

This

will be gained during future interviews).

The infor-

mant's sponsors into the BONANNO Family, LCN, were MIKE

SABELLA and one "MARIANO." He states that MARIANO is about

the age of the informant (62), and SABELLA is his (infor-

mant's) third cousin.

There was no candle light ceremony during this

initiation, nor was there mixing of blood, nor oaths given

with religious pictures. He states that this ceremony

(as described with oaths, etc.) went out approximately

twenty five years ago. At the time of the informant's

initiation, it was

not a pre-requisite for the member to

have participated in a "hit,

"although this was the case

for the older members (prior to twenty-five years ago).

Informant states that the "books" for new members are now

closed and have been for some time, at least insofar as

his particular family is concerned. At the time of his

initiation, there were approximately twenty members in

the BONANNO Family.

There were othef family people present during the

initiation banquet, and following the banquet, for the next:

several weeks, informant was "taken around" to ICN members

and introduced as a new member. This latter situation is

that which the informant described during the previous con-

tacts and states that this is what he construed as formal

initiation, when he was taken

around.

The current

situation with regard to BONANNO

remains as described by the informant after his return to

Miami from New York. Informant states there will be a

"call out" in the near future for members as himself and

others to have a meeting and decide finally if the current

BONANNO Family members still affillated with this family

wish to switch membership to GAMBINO, CARMINE ALUCHOSE

Family) or "retire."

Informant states he will go with

whatever the majority of his colleagues decide, Informant

will advise as to the time and location of the meeting

when he is told by SABELLA or PAUL VARIO..

RE: LON ACTIVITIES, MIAMI DIVISION

Informant advised that at the present time, the

Miami area is relatively quiet, and most of the prominent

people are out of town (those who winter in Miami). They

will start to arrive in several weeks, at which time informant

will advise as

to their arrivals.

Informant re-iterated that the most powerful LON

figure in Miami is PASQUALE ERRA, who is with the GENOVESE

group. Under ERRA in Miami and connected with the GENOVESE

Family are JOSEPH BISOGNO (BRUNO); "JOE SCOOTCH"' (INDELICATO);

"LITTLE PUSSY" (TONY RUSSO).

Among those with CARLO GAMBINO in Miami are JAMES

PALMISANO and TOMMY ALTAMURA.. He states that AGOSTINO AMATO,

VINCENT AMATO and FRANK AMATO, although LON members, are not

with the GAMBINO Family.

He states that JOE RIVERS (SILESI),

to his knowledge, has not been "made" and is utilized primarily

to set up gambling operations.

Informant states that PALMISANO is in constant

trouble with his

"family" through his habit of getting financial

backing from visiting ICN people on lbust out" operations or

through

outright stealing or swindles from his own people.

A case in point, according to the informant, occurred about

three years ago when

a family member named "BIG STEVE" (now

deceased), a junk dealer from New York, came to Miami ard:

MM 137-4138,

was convinced by PALMISANO and INDELIGATO to invest $50,000

in a bar in Miami named the "Skyview" on North Biscayne

Boulevard.

The bar was not worth more than 55,000 and went.

out of business. about a month after it was sold. As a

result, a contract was let for both PALMISANO and INDELICATO

and they were to be "set up" in Hallandale. PALISANO,

however, made peace and gave back the money to "BIG StEvE."

RE: GRAFT AND CORRUPTION

- MIAMI DIVISION.

Informant was asked about recent publicity which

disclosed that a "contract" had been let for Dade County

state Attorney, RICHARD E. GERSTEIN. (This tact had beer

'leaked" to the press by GERSTEIN'S office, which hac

received the tip from a Wackenhut Detective Ageney source.)

Informant stated that this

was the biggest laugh to hit

Miami in some time,

in that GERSTEIN was, and still is,

"their" number one connection in the Miami area.

Informant

said "Them guys (sic), including Wackenhut, and all the

locals haven't yet come close to us, The only people who

have the proper line on us are those in the FBI."
