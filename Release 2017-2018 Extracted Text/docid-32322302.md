Title: JFK TASK FORCE

Synopsis: Work anticipated by the N.O. Division

Reference:

Numerous telephone conversations in May and June,

1996 between Carol Keely, Judy Bowen, Warren Jung, and Elizabeth

Nemeth.

Details: This communication is to advise the JFK Task Force what

steps

the New Orleans Division will take before forwarding the

requested documents to the task force.

New Orleans will inventory and prepare a list of all

Title III transcripts.

As each box of transcripts are

inventoried, they will be forwarded to the Task Force so that

they can be copied.

New Orleans will make a copy of the Title

III logs and forward these logs to the Task Force since a copy

must be maintained by the New Orleans Division (these are our

only copies) for retrieval purposes should New Orleans be

required to respond to other requests regarding this case.

Transcripts found for consensual recordings will be forwarded to

the Task Force for copying.

UAC bY JFK Task Force New Orleans Division will proceed

as set out above.
