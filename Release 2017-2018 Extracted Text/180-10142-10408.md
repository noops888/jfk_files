MOVIMIENTO DEMOCRATA CRISTIANO (MDC)

After Castro's assumption of power in 1959, it became

evident to many Cubans that political parties were being

surpressed and the 26th of July Movement was being infil-

trated by Communists. This political atmosphere gave rise

to the creation of underground organizations such as the

Christian Democratic Movement of Cuba (MDC). Proclaiming

the doctrine of Christianity as its foundation, the MDC

published a manifesto in March, 19602 denouncing Communism

and strongly advocating the free enterprise system.? One

of the founders of the MDC, 35-year-old law professor,

DI. Jose Ignacio Rasco, was elected

head of the organization

and immediately criticized the violence prevalant in the

Castro regime, 5

This public criticism produced pressure on

him to leave Cuba and he arrived in Miani on April 22, 1960.

By June, Rasco had allied himself and the MDC with the Frente

Revolucionario Democratico (FRD)?

and thus became one of the

five original exile Cuban leaders brought together by the

State Department and the. CIA to form the nucleus of a Cuban

8

government-in-exile.

After the Bay of Pigs invasion, the MDC split into factions.

Rasco remained head of the largest faction and organized

delegations in Miami, New York, Chicago, Venezuela and Cuba. 10

credentials to the Cuban Revolutionary Council, (CRC) ,

discovery and made inter-group liaison extremely risky.

Despite the inherent dangers, the underground movements of

the MDC and Movimento Revolucionario del Pueblo (MRP)

worked jointly for an all-out sabotage effort in the

fall

24

of 1961.

The "Batista" faction of the MDC (so named after the

youthful military chief rose to the position of president

in 1962)

entered into similar cooperative alliances with

other exile groups for the purposes of propaganda, sabotage

and

supplying the Cuban' underground. Many MDC members joined

the Cuba Committee in 1962 which was formed to counteract

the propaganda of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, a pro-

Castro organization in the U.S.

26 The MDC and the Directorio

Revolucionario Estudiantil (DRE) worked together to formulate

plans for an underground organization to infiltrate Oriente

27

Province.

The active operations between the MDC and other

anti-Castro groups peaked in the year 1963. One involved

the MDC, the Movimento Insurrecconial de Recuperacion

Revolutionaria (MIRR) and the Movimento Recuperacion

Revolutionaria (MRR). In April, Frank Sturgis, Miami-based

soldier of fortune, supplied information that

Orlando Bosch Avila, Manuel Artime and Alexander Rorke were

jointly planning an air strike over Havana on April 25.

According to Sturgis, the strike was to originate from an

airstrip in ClassifiCafion:

and the target was a sugar refinery. ?9

The bombs were homemade, assembled by Batista.

annorancel thotrotlededeumers) had taken place as scheduled,

which took the other planners by surprise.

Sturgis claimed

the strike was still in the planning stage and financial

backing had not been completed.

32 This incident created a

stir and resulted in an intensive FBI investigation of Rorke's

allegation.

Since Radio Havana, contrary to usual policy,

34

made no immediate protest over the bombing,

the FBI concluded

that Rorke's story was probably untrue and, according to

36

Sturgis, merely a publicity stunt.

In early June, 1963, the MDC made a unity pact with

Commandos I in which the latter group was to provide training

and assistance in military intelligence and the MDC to provide

three small boats and a team of men to infiltrate Cuba.

MDC also made a pact with Dr: Carlos Prio Socarras, former

President of Cuba who donated $50,000 to the group for military

aid in return for its promise of political support.

39

Richard Rudolph Davis, a Cuban alien,

had a preipheral

association with the MDC through his contact with

in the summer of 1963. This association was noted in Book V,

Final Report of the Senate Select Committee

40

mental Operations.

Davis was residing in New Orleans and, although not an

MDC member, claimed to have once been a "coordinator" for the

41

group and the New York Police Department.

was in a position to recommend men in the Miami area

42

who needed work.

Davis claimed he could provide employment

for a small group of Cuban emigres.

He said he had entered

into a business deal with geologist David L. Raggio and

a wealthy, right-wing New Orleanian, Gus de LaBarre, forming

43

the Guatemalan Lumber and Mineral Corporation.

It was their

intention to train the Cubans on some land in Lacombe, Louisiana

to which De LaBarre had access through his nephew, Frank

44

de LaBarre.

After a

necessary training period, the group

was to be sent to Guatemala to cut mahogany trees, he claimed.

A group of about 18 Cubans did arrive in New Orleans in

the summer of 1963. Leading them was a well-known Cuban

exile, Victor Paneque

who used the military code name of

46

"Commadante Diego".

Paneque was closely associated with

in the military activities of the MDC.

47 Davis

later admitted|to the FBI that the men had arrived dressed

and thought that

they were to receive military

training.

In the latter part of July, 1963, the FBI conducted a

raid on property near that of the "lumber company" training

camp. The Bureau seized a cache of dynamite and other ex-

50

plosives.

This raid, according to Davis, unnerved his

51

trainees, and they elected to return to Miami.

from Gus de LaBarre's nephew and attorney, Frank de LaBarre,

who first related his story in 1966 to his former law school

classmate, Jim Garrison.

De LaBarre said his "Uncle Gus" had introduced him to

Davis, whom De LaBarre described as a "floater." They came to

see De LaBarre about drawing up articles of incorporation

for the Guatemalan Lumber Company and that is when he says

he learned of their plans to bring unemployed Cubans from

Miami to train as lumberjacks. Uncle Gus sent provisions to

the exiles on a daily basis and solicited money for food and

clothing from friends and relatives.

Although he suspected that military training was being

conducted at the camp, Frank-de LaBarre said he didn't pay

much attention to the activities of the group. Hewever, When

he heard on his car radio that the FBI had seized a cache of

howeks

ammunition at a house in Lacombe, he immediately called his

uncle. Although receiving assurances that the lumber group

was not involved, De LaBarre called the officers of the

corporation together and

insisted that the Cubans be taken

out of there. Davis, however, told him that the Cubans did

not want to leave, whereupon De LaBarre said he had to do

some real "brainstorming." He rented a Hertz ton-and-a-half

the Cubans loaded their gear,

jumped in the truck and were

brought to the Greyhound bus terminal in New Orleans. Each

was given a one-way ticket to Miami plus a small amount of

cash and told they would get their orders when they reached

Miami. Looking as though ready for war, with knapsacks and

guns bulging from under their clothes, they boarded the bus.

That was the last, De LaBarre said, he saw of them.

The last he heard of davis, he said, was in 1964 when

one of De LaBarre's friends reported he had gone into business

with Davis and was left with a lot of bills. 54

Other than providing the manpower for the training camp,

was not involved in this episode or was the

MDC as an organization.

Concurrent with his involvement with leaders of other

exile organizations,

was dealing with foreign

governments in an effort to gain support for his faction of

the MDC. After the World Congress of Christian Democrats in

Strasburg, France, two West German officials of the Christian

Democratic Party conferred with the MDC in Miami. 55 According

to ore of the officials, the West Germans, after months of

study, had decided to help finance the MDC, not because they

were particularly fond of them, but felt once Cuba was liberated

the Cubans would have

56

Latin America.

Another offer of help came from Luis Somoza, former

President of Nicaragua, who provided the MDC a base for

operations in that country.

57 Venezuelan President, Romulo

Betancourt, allegedly also offered to make a base available

58

for the MDC and provide it with personnel and supplies.

Recognizing that these Latin American bases of operation

were important to the MDC,

nonetheless pre-

ferred to work out of the Miami area. Its proximity to

Cuba, good facilities for operating boats and the availability

of a large

number of Cubans to serve as mechanics and do other

necessary labor made Miami more desirable than the Latin

American facilities. 5o

The major drawback in Miami was the

presence of U.S. government officials

determined to strictly

enforce the Neutrality Act and other Federal statutes.

• U.S. Customs raided MDC headquarters in Miami on

April 21, 1964 and confiscated a large cache of arms and

ammunition.

Undeterred, the MDC simply relocated the

military section in separate headquarters, continued to store

who, once they

got adequate arms and ammunition, planned to

go into the mountains of Cuba. 63

The MDC eventually suffered the fate of other anti-Castro

organizations -- finding it increasingly difficult to finance

infiltration and sabotage missions, and experiencing in-

creased surveillance by U.S. authorities determined to limit

their activities. The organization's activities gradually

declined,

eventually gave up his anti-Castro

activities, moved to Washington, D. C. and received a doctoral

degree in political science. 64
