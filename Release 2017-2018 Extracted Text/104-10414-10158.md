I assured Mr. Blakey that I would be happy to discuss

with him any of the deleted items and explain the nature of

the content and the reason for its deletion.

I told Mr. Blakey

nat since he was personally reviewing the material, and the

same would hold true for Mr. Cornwell, I telt that I

could be

very candid in describing the deleted portions. Mr. Blakey

thanked me, but did not at any time raise

any questions about

deletions.

After he had finished his reivew I repeated my

offer to discuss any portion of the material. He again thanked

me and

said he had no questions.

Mr. Blakey did not indicate (nor did I ask) whether

he would continue to seek access to the entire three volume

history in its unsanitized form.
