MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

Director

Center for the study of Intelligence

Errors in Release of 1967

Inspector General's Report

Your Memorandum, Same Subject,

Dated 30 December 1993

1.

This memorandum is in response to your request for

an explanation of why certain information contained in the

Kennedy Assassinations records was released.

2. The 1967 IG report is part of the "sequestered"

records that CIA provided to the House Assassinations

Committee.

As far as we can determine, the facts are as

described

below.

3.

With one exception, it was our intention to protect

the information in question

to the extent permitted by the

Kennedy Assassinations Records Act.

It appears that in the

final redaction phase three items were inadvertently left in

he version that was sent to the National Archives.

This

ersion is the same as that reviewed by the Do officers

assigned to us to conduct coordination of releases.

4. There are three specific types of information

involved:

a. Staff officer's

name

Nestor Sanchez's name was deleted from all but

one page, where the last name only--which is

common one in Spanish--remained. It had bee

agreed with the DO several months earlier that

Sanchez's name could be released in other JFK

documents. (The officer is a well-known person,

now retired, who has been publicly identified as

formerly with CIA.)

Errors in Release of 1967

Inspector General's

Report

b. Names of two covert assets

we one test a sue at he at, who.

name was deleted every place it appeared, with one

exception. We deeply regret these two mistakes.

c. Reference to Rome

The reference appears in connection with a

well-known former Agency officer--Bill Harvey.

Following is the precise wording.

"After Harvey--

was winding up his headquarters responsibilities in

preparation

for assignment to Rome, he wrote a

memorandum. "

The word "station" does not appear.

The JFK

Act does not permit protection of an assignment

location if it is not explicit that a station or

other permanent facility is identified.

Harvey's

assignment to that city was acknowledged in the

open literature.

3.

We regret release of the names of two covert

assets.

It may be that the rush to review more than 250,000

pages within a mandated deadline contributed to the problem.

We are making every effort to ensure that the process of

multiple review is as effective as possible and note that

thus far, only a few mistakes have come to light.
