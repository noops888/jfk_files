Although Subject acted as a guard

he appeared to be fairly well educated and was

not subservient to any of the other

with the

exception of

(201-028975).

On one occasion Subject was reported to be

helping the daughter L

with nér arithmetic homework. On another,

Subject was asked

about nethods of producing metal wire,

a subject on which Subject was well informed as a result of

his having once worked for a wire factory.

Subject had

a tape recorder at home which he liked to

listen to.

le also occasionally

went fishing

Subject told

to build a large garage,

because he was bringing a big car back with him. He also

asked whether

had bought a refrigerator and IV for the

apartment.

On another occasion he was negotiating for a can

of paint

to take backl

with him to repaint

Subject and his wife were both buying watches

just before leaving

From the above it appears

that Subject was fairly well-off financially, for a guard.
