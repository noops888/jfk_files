DOCUMENTATIONS

are set forth to be utilized by all field offices in handling

"La Cosa Nostra" investigations.

"La Cosa Nostra", translated as "Our Thing", is the

name used by members of the

organized Italian criminal element

to refer to their over-all criminal organization.

The framework

of "La Cosa Nostra" consists of "bonsate" or

"families"

, each

ruled by a "capo" or "boss"

The "capo" appoints

a "sotto-capo"

or "underboss"

and a "consiglieri" or "counselor", who advises

the "boss" and

the "soldati" or "soldiers", when required.

The "soldati"

are the lowest strata of membership and are

directly under a

"capodecina" (a "captain" or "lieutenant"),

appointed by the "capo" to exercise his authority over the

"soldati" assigned to a "decina", or group. A "Commissione"

on "Commission'

comprised of a group

of "bosses" from various

parts of the United States is the uitimate authority of "La

Cosa Nostra". Members of the "Commissione"are referred to

individually as

"rappresentante"

a term also signifying the

status of "boss".

(Note:

Sources:
