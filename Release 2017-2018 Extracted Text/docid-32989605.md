FBI INDEXING PROCEDURES

The FBE utilizes a system of maintaining its over 6, 500, 000 investigative,

personnel, and administrative files by which all information on a given subject is

channeled into one file. In order to facilitate control of the file and accommodate

multiple subject(s)'matters, a numbering system is used to'indicate: (1) gèneral.

classification and nature of the violation; (2) the individual case file in this category;

and (3) serialization of each piece of mail in the file. For instance, the 'number'

7-100-10 on a piece of mail indicates it is the 10th piece of mail in the 100th file*:

assigned in the. Kidnaping (7) classification. Our files are maintained in 185 classi-

fications. A list of these classifications is attached.

The key to these numerically maintained files is the general index presently

consisting of over 58, 000, 000 index cards on all manner of subject matters but

primarily a name index of individuals. This master index must be searched to

determine what information, if any, the FBI may have in its files. In view of this

system, each communication must have a subject.

The classifier in the Classifying Unit of the Mail Processing Unit of the

Records Section in the Files and Communications Division designates the "subject"

of the particular communication on which a "main" index card is prepared; assigns

the classification showing the violation or nature of the matter involved; and designates

names in the body of the communication on which "see" (contraction for see reference

or cross-reference) index cards are to be prepared.

The "main" index card denotes that the name on index card is the subject of

the file and the name on "see" index card indicates the name is not the main subject

of the file but that the name only appears in a specific communication filed in the file

of a different subject matter.

The subject of the file may be on a variety of topics such as an individual,

organization, company, publication, foreign intelligence activities, or such adminis-

trative items as space, equipment, or automobile accidents involving FBI automobiles

After the classifier has designated the "subject" and assigned the classificati

for the communication, the classifier designates the names in the body of the com-

munication on which "see" index cards are to be prepared. The nature and extent of

## Page 55

detail in the communication require the classifier to utilize judgment as to whether

information should be designated for index cards. The classifier has general guide-

lines for each of the 185 classifications. Generally, in a criminal-type matter, the

following will be cross-indexed: suspects; uncooperative individuals; anyone giving

assistance to the subject such as a person who allowed a bank robber to use his car

while committing a bank robbery; person passing, possessing and disposing of

ransom money; fences of stolen property; titles of song sheets or films being dis-

tributed in violation of copyright laws; madames and procurers; a person suspected

of harboring a fugitive, and the original complainant in the case.: Complainant is

indexed so that the 'investigation can be identified should the complainant make inquiry

- regarding his allegation at a later 'date.=

.. s

In security-type investigations, the classifier is governed by the type lof

investigation and the nature and extent of the information in the communication.

The classifier will generally index associates and relatives of the subject; members

of organizations under investigation or determined to be possible subversive; indi-

viduals contributing funds to subversive-type activity; subversive or seditious

publications; writers of articles in subversive or seditious publications; bookstores

specializing in subversive-type publications and related types of information.

As an example of such indexing, the following indexing would occur in con-

nection with a case involving the investigation of an extortion threat against Congress-

man X in which the individual making the threat is unknown. The vast majority of

extortion cases we receive involve threats against individuals by unknown individuals.

As previously stated, each file must have a subject to insure all mail on a matter is

filed in one place. Accordingly, in order to insure that all mail on an investigation

is placed in the same file, the victim's name is used as the subject of the file when

the individual who made the threat is unknown. Accordingly, Congressman X, as

the victim, would be subject of the file for mail filing purposes.

The "main" index

card prepared would show that he is the victim and not the extortionist. "See" index

cards will be prepared on any individuals suspected of writing the threatening letter.

If a suspect is later identified as the extortionist, a "main" index card is prepared

• on his name to indicate we now have a file on this individual as the subject of a

specific criminal investigation.

As previously stated, access to the numerically maintained files is through

the index cards maintained in the general index. The index cards are, accordingly,

retained as long as the file is in existence.

Age of information in FBI files covers a relatively short span of years.

FBI had a relatively small number of files until the President, in 1939, directed the

FBI to be responsible for the internal security of the United States. In view of this

and, as the number of violations of law over which the FBI has jurisdiction has

increased greatly since 1939, the vast majority of FBI files has been created since

:HH 55019 Do0Id:32989605 Page 55

## Page 56

1939. We do, however, have a program for destroying files which no longer have

a contemporary value. Regulations of the National Archives and Records Service,

General Services Administration, issued under authority of Chapters 29, 31, and

33, Title 41, U.'S. Code, govern our file retention and destruction procedures.

When the files are destroyed, the "main" and "see" cards for all matters in the

files are pulled from the general index and destroyed.
