Re your airtel 3/10/67.

Attached for information of Chicago Office are copies

of a communication from Legat,

Bern, with respect to

current status

of the exclusion order which the Swiss

authorities had previously imposed on Gus Alex.

In view of the

fact we have provided them with significant information in

the

past, it does not appear that providing them with any

additional information is at this

time warranted.

It is noted that Alex's legal representative

allegedly advised a Swiss official that it was illegal for

a U. S. representative to furnich derogatory information

concerning a U. S. citizen to a foreign goveriment. For

your information, the Bureau is unaware of any such

prohibition.

GUS ALEX,

Re Buairtel 7/27/66.

CHARLES HEUBI, Chief of the Service of Appeals

Swiss Federal Department of Justice and Police, stated that his

office had come to the conclusion that the Swiss authorities

did not possess sufficient proof of a legal nature to uphold

the interdiction of entry into Switzerland against ALEX.

HEUBI

noted that in his opinion this entrance ban had been instigated

by the Zurich Police in an effort to avoid the loss of manpower

and funds required to keep track of ALEX when he was in their

territory.

In the coursè of the conversation, HEUBI made

available pertinent sections of his file on ALEX

which con-

tained items he thought might be of interest to the Bureau as

follows:

(1) A letter dated 5/15/65 from DR. Iur. HUGO

ROSENSTIEL and DR. Iur. ANDREAS GIRSBERGER, 8011 Zurich,

Talstr. Il, who appear to have been ALEX's former legal

representatives in Zurich.

This letter forwards a birth certi-

ficate for ALEX,

a police certificate stating that ALEX had

no police record in Evergreen Park, Illinois and a police

certificate

stating

that ALEX had

• County, Illinois.

no criminal record in cook

as far as he was aware ALEX had never been convicted of an

He concluded by describing ALEX

a law abiding, decent, successful representative of the business

community in Chicago.

(4) A. letter from EVERETT MC KINLEY

U.S. Senator, to the Swiss authores, MCN TRESEN that

it was his understanding that ALEX had no criminal record

whatsoever,

and that despite this, AlEx had been denied entry

into Switzerland on the basis of criminal behavior of an

desired foreigner.

Senator DIRKSEN asked that ALEX be informed

of the basis for this action on the part of the Swiss authorities,

and asked that the Swiss

government reconsider its decision.

(5) Signed statement of ALEX dated 10/20/66, in

which he explained that the discrepancies in his birth date were

caused by an error on the part of the midwife who delivered him.

He denied ever having been a bodyguard for anyone, and stated

that he was not responsible for rackets in the Chicago under-

world, nor was

he a gang leader.

With regard to accusations in the "Spiegel"

article, he had never been a vice president of the Cosa Nostra,

and was not nor had he been one of GIANCANA's directors in the

syndicate.

He was not a caporegima in the syndicate and was not

He claimed that he does not live in an apartment

under the name of SAM TAYLOR, but that SAM and MAE JAYLOR are

his brother and sister-in-law who have adopted the name TAYLOR.

years old, and ALEX never knew or saw CAPONE. He claimed he

or of any person.

He had never been convicted of an offense

except for minor traffic offenses.

(6). A letter dated 11/30/66 from DR. AUGUST KELLER,

Attorney,

Zurich, who appears

to be ALEX's present legal counsel,

to the Swiss authorities stated that his client claims never to

have done anything which was not allowed or which would make him

undesirable in Switzerland.

If ALEX had had illegal gambling

halls, why hadn't the authorities prosecuted him?

From 1953-54

he worked for Stanley Stupner, Inc., liquor distributors, in the

sales department.

From 1955-57 and

part of 1958 he worked for

Blatz Brewing Co. as sales manager.

From 1957-58 he worked as

head of the public relations department of De Luxe Cigarette

Service, Inc.

In 1958 he worked as head of the public relations

department of Ajax Phonograph Co.

He never had any financial

interest in these firms, however.

In 1950 he visited Greece with his mother.

Since

1956-57 he has gone to Europe every year for winter sports,

except for the winter of 1959-60 when he was sick.

In 1961 he visited

Greece, Germany, Italy, Switzer-

land, and made vacation trips to Mexico,

Canada and the Bahamas.

On some of these trips he was accompanied by his wife.

(7). with regard to the various names used by ALEX,

Attorney E. BERNSTEIN in Chicago, lawyer for the De Luxe Cigar-

ette Co., informed by letter dated 8/15/66 that ALEX uses an

apartment under the name TAYLOR, which is the name of his brother-

in-law (sic). ALEX has an account at the American National Bank

under the name G. N. ALEX.

RYAN is the maiden name of ALEX's

wife. His true birth date is April 1, 1916. He is a respected

member of the St. Nicholas Orthodox Church, Oak Lawn, 111., anc

Congressman WILLIAM L. DAWSON and Senator EVERETT MC KINLEY

DIRKSEN have intervened on his behalf. Included with this letter

was a blank check of the American National Bank and Trust Co.;

a statement dated 8/22/66 signed by EARL KIES, president of the

De Luxe CIgarette Service, Inc., and HAROLD EDWARDS, secretary,

certifying that neither ALEX nor any of his family were owners

of part owners of the company.

for the Ajax Phonograph Co.

(8) A letter dated 8/20/66 from Rev. Father LOUIS I.

GREANIAS, Pastor of the Orthodox Church at 4501 West 103rd

St., Oak Lawn, Ill.; certified that ALEX was a respected member

of

that congregation.

HEUBI mentioned that he had had a meeting with

ALEX's legal representatives, including JOSEPH H. SHARLITT.

These individuals stated that in their opinion "the material

furnished the Swiss authorities by the American Embassy in

Bern" was not sufficient on which to base an entry ban.

stated that he made a non-committal answer to this statement,

and did not indicate that any of the information in his

possession

was obtained either from the Embassy or from the FBI.

SHARLITT further remarked that it was illegal

for a U. S. representative to furnish derogatory information

concerning a U.S. citizen to a foreign government.

Bureau is requested to inform if there is any

basis to. SHARLITT's statement.

Bureau is further requested to inform if there is

any information in addition to that already furnished the Swiss

authorities which could be used by them as a basis to retain

the entry ban against ALEX.

It is felt that there would be

some benefit to the Bureau if ALEX could be kept out of Switzer-

land:

since there is a possibility that he may attend to some

banking business when

he is here.
