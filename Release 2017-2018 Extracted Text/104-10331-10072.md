NOTE FOR:

SUBJECT:

JFK Assassination Files

our goal is to meet the 22 August 1993 deadline for

completing the processing of the JFK Assassination records.

We have added personnel on evening and weekend shifts to

perform the indexing of documents, which is a major task

There are several outstanding issues that we plan-to

liscuss with the JFK Review Board,

once the President

appoints the members.

We are advised that the appointments

will probably be announced by the end of July, but that it

is unlikely that the Board will be in full operation by

22 August.

Among the issues to be discussed with the Board

are the relevancy of certain sensitive operational records;

the handling of MHCHAOS (US persons) files; and processing

of microfilm which includes duplicatory material.

Pessina
