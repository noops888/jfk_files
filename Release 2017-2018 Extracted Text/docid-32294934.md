to Pittsburgh, 4/30/58.

The matter of subject's conferences with his confederates at

the Ken Iron and Steel Company, New Kensington, Pa., has

been the subject of considerable discussion among agents

assigned to Top Hoodlum investigations in Pittsburgh, Pa.,

with respect to the possible use of unusual investigative

investigative techniques could be established. Unfortunately

adequate security cannot be guaranteed; consequently, confidential

or unusual investigative techniques are not being considered

at this time.

the individual referred to as #LOUIE"

of Chicago, Illinois,

regarding the gambling situation in Havana, Cuba,

was

partially overheard by TOM LATTOS, the roommate of PCI|
