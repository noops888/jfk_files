MENORANDUM FOR: Chief, Central Cover Staff

SUBJECT

: Offictal Cover for Mr.

We have been informed by the Clandestine Service

Agent Panol that they pose no objection to the converston

of Mx03

Jiron Staff Agent status to Stall Employee

statua which will enable him to work regularly in the

Headquarters building.

They do, however, feel that prior

to his conversion a suitable cover, consistent with his

legal background, must be arranged.

In informal discussions with your office, a

possibility of arranging non-offielal cover with a local

law firm was discussed.

This law firm would ostensibly

will be hired by the law firn to serve as a

legal advisor to the goverment agencies thus enabling

hi. to be gone from the office a great part of the time.

In view of his many contacts in goverment and private

circles, this type of cover vould hold up since some of

his friends may try to physically reach hin at the

office.
