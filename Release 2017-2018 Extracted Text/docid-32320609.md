5.

If the policy of not acknowledging our FCI

targets is changed for any country's establishment or

officials, all coverages on the establishment or

officials, as well as cases opened on persons who

contacted

the establishment or officials will also be

declassified for foreign relations reasons.

HOW

DOJ/DRC will handle these matters under Executive Order

12958 is uncertain since no case history has been

established yet.

It appears, at present, that the DRC

will protect the technical coverages, lookouts and mail

covers by allowing classification under the "method"

exemption.

The DRC has classified several

investigations using the foreign relations and method

exemptions.

To date, no foreign relations exemption

has been declassified, but two on the former soviet

Union are being referred to USDS. If the investigation

is declassified, any telephone calls received at the

establishment or by the officials would be

declassified; however, much of the information would

still be protected under FOIA guidelines.

That would

not protect the fact of the technical coverage nor the

target. (8) (u)

If the investigation and technical, mail, banking,

of other coverage of one establishment

is declassified,

it sets the precedent of an open acknowledgment that

the United States Government condones and, in

there are countries we currently have disagreements or poor

relations with since the policy of our government is to improve

such relationships in the short term or long term and such

revelations would show a disrespect for the people of that

country; and the declassification for release of some documents,

even of

significant historical interest, will be carefully

weighed by the FBI against the revelation of our investigative

partieular country. Mil the establishments or officials of a

• The FBI notes that since the Intelligence Community's

current policy is not to admit any technical or other coverages

or investigations of foreign officials or establishments, any

release of documents that confirms such coverages would therefore

be harmful both to United states foreign relations with that and

other countries and the FBI's FCI investigative capabilities

including the revelation of sensitive sources and methods.

i (1)

The FBI is not aware of any country which acknowledges

the use of any technical or other coverages or investigations of

foreign officials or establishments in their own country

elsewhere. (Ru)

OF SPECIAL NOTE:

In making a decision on whether declassification would

harm

foreign relations with any country, the FBI requests careful

consideration of the effects on the FBI's FCI capabilities,

including our investigative sources and methods, or technical

coverages. The FBI contends that if USDS decides it would not

harm foreign relations with a particular country to officially

acknowledge that the FBI investigates its establishments or

officials, this will nevertheless result in the revelation of the

FBI's investigative sources and methods used, as well as have a

detremental effect on our capabilities to enter foreign

counterintelligence or law enforcement cooperative exchanges.

The FBI also requests USDS to consider the interests of

the lational security Agencyland consult with them prior to

reaching a decision.
