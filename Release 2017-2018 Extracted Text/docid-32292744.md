Alderman D'ARCO,

PAT HOY,

at which time HOY was instructed to see that persons involved

in this situation employed at the Hilton Hotel did not make any

arrangements to interview FIO RITO with the proviso that he

would write a favorable story regarding him.

It is pointed

out that on 2/23/63 PETAQUE met with MARCY and made

arrangements to write a story favorable to the First Ward

situation and FIO RITO and was given a monetary gift despite

his objections by MARCY.

Election Commissioner HOLTZMAN has ruled that to be

eligible to be elected as an Alderman that the only residence

requirement is that the individual elected reside in the Ward

the day he is elected. From this ruling it is obvious that

MARCY has misinterpreted the rule. All of this consternation

with the papers has resulted from

this misinterpretation, the

net result obviously lowering MARCY's position with the hoodlums.
