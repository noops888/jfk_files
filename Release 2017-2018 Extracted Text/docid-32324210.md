The investigative period of this report predates

the last report because the results of investigation

were not received until after the dictation of that report.

DL 275-C-TE advised SA WILLIAM B. HOLLOMAN

on 8/20/69, that subject ISADORE MAX MILLER visits almost

daily Denny's Coffee

Shop, 3130 W. Mockingbird Lane, Dallas,

Texas, which is owned

managed by JOHn ELI STONE.

During these visits he is in contact with StONE, who is

known to be active in booking and gambling eircles in the

Dallas area.
