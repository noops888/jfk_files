PAGE 3 FROM PHILADELPHIA

082000

IN FLORIDA INTENDING TO REMAIN APPROXIMATELY TWO MONTHS

CONTINUING INVESTIGATION OF ANGELO BRUNO'S TAX MATTERS.

CHIOVERO IN SUBSTANCE WAS STATING THAT HE WAS IN CHARGE

OF IRS INVESTIGATION IN PHILADELPHIA. AL SIASI MENTIONED

ABOVE HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO BE REVENUE AGENT DOING AUDITING

WORK ON UNKNOWN PHASE OF BRUNO'S TAX INVESTIGATION. IT IS

KNOWN THAT CHIOVERO HAS INTERVIEWED SUBJECT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS

AND IF DESIROUS OF INTERVIEWING OR ARRANGING AN APPOINTMENT

WITH BRUNO FOR LEGITIMATE REASON IN LINE OF OFFICIAL BUSINESS,

-WOULD NOT NEED LOU AS AN INTERMEDIARY. MARIO MAGGIOSS INTEREST

IN IRS AGENT AL SIASI MAY BE DUE TO POSSIBILITY HE CONDUCTED

AUDIT OF RECORDS OF BRUNO'S NEPHEW, MICHAEL GRASSO, WHO

APPARENTLY IS NOT TRUSTED BY MARIO MAGGIO. AT THE PRESENT

TIME THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT LOU MAY BE MAKING OVERTURES

TO BRUNO AND THE MAGGIO BROTHERS, WITH APPROVAL OF JOHN

CHIOVERO. THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS, HOWEVER, THAT LOU MAY BE

CLAIMING TO REPRESENT CHIOVERO AND AL SIASI TO ENHANCE

HIMSELF WITH BRUNO, WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF OBTAINING A GIFT.

ACCORDINGLY, THE PHILADELPHIA DIVISION IS OPENING A SEPARATE

INVESTIGATION ENTITLED "LOUIS ALFRED PERSICHETTI; BRIBERY,"

AND WILL ADD CHIOVERO AND SIASI AS SUBJECTS IF INVESTIGATION

ESTABLISHES THIS FACT. WITH TWO TECHNICAL SOURCES IN OPERATION,

PLUS A LIVE INFORMANT

IN THE EMPLOY OF THE SUBJECT, IT IS FELT

THAT BEST RESULTS CAN BE OBTAINED BY USE OF INFORMANTS RATHER

THAN OPEN ACTIVE INVESTIGATION. THE POSSIBILITY THAT SURVEIL

LANCES AND OPEN INVESTIGATION COULD JEOPARDIZE INFORMANTS IN

THIS MATTER IS REALIZED. MIAMI AND NEWARK ARE BEING ADVISED

BY MAIL COPIES WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO USE DISCRETION, IN THE

EVENT THEY RECEIVE AN INQUIRY FROM IRS RE BRUNO, CONSIDERING

THAT IRS IS CONDUCTING INVESTIGATION ON SUBJECT

IN BOTH THE

NEWARK AND MIAMI DIVISIONS. BRUNO CONSIDERED DANGEROUS.
