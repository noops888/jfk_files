It he had any suspledons about 18/502

We do not want to turn this

into a "Dear Abby" letter, but feel that Golúb may be suffering from a

father compler. Golub and his wife have been unable to have children, and

ho has mentioned that he would desperately like to. Whenever he talks about

this he becomes noticeably distressed.

Golub appeara to be attracted to

Jounger

This was the case with his former assistant in the sovlot

Consulate here, Mikhall Lyubinor, who was a young, intelligent, cultured

Soriet.

Golub frequently refere to Lyubinor mentioning how much he llked

Golub'o personality, we do not think it too strange that he likes her for

attempt a recruitment or some other form of embarrassment; but we also believe

that his feelings are such toward AEy5 that he would continue soning (AE5D2

the fact that Golub 1s a shred Intelligence operator.

Fron the outset of

OZthe AT)'5-Colub contact, ve Instructed her to use extreme caution, that Golub

was hore than a Consul, and that behind this friendly and gregarious nature,

there was a calculating, diabolical individual, and that she should at all ..

questions that Golub night raise feeling that she was clever and well-read

enough to answer on her own. We did not want to give Golub any impresaion

that she was being briefed on what to say and to sake.
