Office, central plant, not possible at this time. It was

determined that Mrs, MILANO, due to a temporary

illness,

has limited her activity and spends majority of time at

motel. Periods away from motel room are for short periods

only.

Mrs. MILANO has indicated to motel operator that

she expects

her son and her husband to be in Cuyahoga Falls,

prior to wedding, July 10, 1965, and has inquired re

accommodations for them at motel although no definite

arrangements made. Mrs. MILANO has indicated that she

is considering moving to kitchenette apartment in same motel

when other members of family arrive.

Because of her

possible move to another room and her limited periods away

from the room, no permanent installation will be made,

however, WACB, a WASP will be installed in Room 119 and

will be monitored on a select basis from a local plant:

In the event she does move, a survey of the new quarters

will be made prior to occupancy and misur coverage

installed, consistent with full security.
