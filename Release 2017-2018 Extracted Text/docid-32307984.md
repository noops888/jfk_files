DI 92-383

FRANK DESIMONE, LOS Angeles; CARLOS NARCELLO, New Orleans.

Based

on recent developments, it appears that

JOE IANNI

is in the probable

position of "underboss" to CIVELLO in

the Dallas

"Family".

As noted in the report,

IANNI iS

possibly related

to the PELLEGRINO family of

New York,

ROCCO PELLEGRINO having been identified as a member.

IANNI has been in touch with PETER PELLEGRINO, a SOn Of

ROCCO, in the recent past and was reportedly involved

with PETER's attempts to set up a bookmaking operation

in Dallas several years ago. The PELLEGRINOS are also

A number of CIVELLO's associates, as well as

CIVELLO, migrated to the Dallas area years ago from the

Baton Rouge - New Orleans, Louisiana, area.

Study of

previous information received from the Bureau of Narcotics

shows that CIVELLO clearly had his connections in the nar

cotic traffic out of New Orleans.

There has been no

indication that CIVELLO has been involved with narcotics

since his release from the Federal penitentiary in the

early 1940's, yet he still maintains contact apparently

with prior contacts he established while involved with

narcotics.

With regard to DL 105-C, Dallas is of the view

that this informant has probably furnished the most accurate

information available as to the early existence of the

tamily in Dallas.

In order to understand why he knows;

it should be born

in mind that informant's father was a

close associate of the group he identifies, was involved

in the same criminal activities, and after making

"his

money"

• went legitimate and became a bondsman, where he

continued to have close contacts with members of the

same

group.

This informant is not active at this time, although

a current effort is being made to induce him to cooperate.

Through other informants in position to know, it has been

determined that DL 105-C is extremely close to CIVELLO and

The Bureau is aware of efforts by the Dallas Office

of prodding IRS into raiding BOSCO's operation, due to added

complication that Detective SANSONE was involved and IRS and

Dallas Police Department were doing nothing about it

This

was reported to the Bureau in the BOSCO case by airtel dated

-C.
