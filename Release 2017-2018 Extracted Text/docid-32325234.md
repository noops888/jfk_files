ReWFOairtel to Bureau 1/25/60.

For info of Lab, subject EDWARD F. WEINHEIMER

has been indicted by FoJ, WDC, for perjury and his trial

will commence 23/6 Investigation determined that on

8/14/57, $1,000 in currency was sent via registered air

mail in three separate envelopes by ESCO to

WEINHEIMER

at Des Moines, Iowa and on 9/16/57,

$1,000 in currency

was sent via registered regular mail in two separate

envelopes by ESCO to WEINHEIMER at Detroit, Michigan.

The government is contending that these funds were given

to subiect BAKER by WEIN EIMER.

JER Law 10(a)2

On 1/25/60, PLATO CACHERIS and ABRAHAM PORETZ,

Department of Justice attorneys, stated that a possible

defense by WEINHEIMER would be that the currency would

have weighed too much to have been sent via minimum postage.

In this connection the attorneys advised that GEORGE

FRANCIS CALLAHAN of ESCO was unsure in his testimony

whether or not the currency was in

$100 or $50 denominations.

They said he indicated the money was not sent by cover

letter or within an enclosed inner envelope, however,

they

said they felt that this was possible.

that a test be made by the FBI to determine whether or not

20 used bills of any denomination as well as a letter size

piece of paper and a business size envelope could be sent

through the mails for the minimum amount of postage.

tests to accomplish the request of the departmental

attorneys.

In addition, it is requested that the FBI Lab

if possible determine the weight of various denominations

of currency.
