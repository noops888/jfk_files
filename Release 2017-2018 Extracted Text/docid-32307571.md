Local 495 in September, 1961, but that the employees

knew they were members of a union and that they did know

this transfer took place.

The number of SCHEIB workers belonging to Local

from HOFFA to DORIA (CSLA 4350-C estimated $250,000)

although the SCHEIB contract was Local 886's largest and

it does not seem logical that they would give 1t up for

nothing. It was indicated, however, that the possibility

exists in the future that the Teamsters may. grant a

charter to Local 886.

As far as RICHARDAKAVNER Obtaining a loan and

putting up borrowed

stock as collateral in an attempt to

hide the percentage of pay off he received on the SCHEIB

deal, investigation

showed that he did receive a loan

but the collateral (stock) was in his name and had been

in his name for a year or

two prior to the SCHEIB deal

and that the loan was paid off through the sale of some of

the same

stock.

SCHEIB and KAVNER did fly to San Francisco in

the SCHEIB company's plane on 7/18/61 to meet with JAMES

RIDDLE HOFFA to talk over the transfer of SCHEIB workers

in Southern California from Local 886 to Local 495

and to give SCHEIB a

the possibility of his opening up new shops in Northern

California with Teamster contracts, but this would not

be considered unusual taking into consideration Mr. SCHEIB'S

idea of having all of his shops under one international

union. (Review of records show that the majority of

SCHEIB's shops throughout the country were represented

by Teamster Locals up to two years prior to the transfer

of the Southern California shops from Local 886 to

Local 495.)

Mr. SCHEIB admits to meeting ANTHONY DORIA at COL

two other occasions but there is no way of knowing at this

time how many times or how well SCHEIB does know DORIA.
