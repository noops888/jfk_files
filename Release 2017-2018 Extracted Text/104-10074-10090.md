MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Mr. Stephen Van Cleave

1. On 27 and 28 February calls were received from Bill

Cantrell, OPS/ITG, andE

WH/4/AR, concerning

0-AS 322 03435/4

nformation and 83 Cantrell wanted to be sure FBI had

wanted to advise DCD that there was

a file on subject and DeD should be aware of some of his

background. Evan Ames stopped in to seef

next visit to headquarters and received a fill-in on subject's

background.

2. Subsequently a call was received from Charlotte in

C/WH Division office (x-7350).

It was imperative to determine

the exact date of contact with Van Cleave as C/WH, thru

Legislative Counsel, had advised Congress on 7 January 1974

that the Agency had no contact with Van Cleave. Atlanta and

Miami were contacted and date of first contact was set at 25

one nate or first con

January 1974. Both offices were requested to provide a record

of contact with Van Ceave.

Atlanta had several

hours of tape

(from first and second meeting) which Pangburn would have transcribed

and forwarded for the record.

Called John Peterson later and

advised that WH has asked that tapes also be forwarded to

headquarters for retention.

3.

We.were advised that the Congressional inquiry on

Van Cleave resulted from a remark overheard at a cocktail

party - that Van Cleave had commented that he was working with

CIA under cover.

Van Cleave was scheduled as potential witness

of House Internal Security Committee so House had inquired

as to whether his appearance would embarrass the Agency. As

noted, response on 7 January was that Agency had no contact with

Van Cleave.
