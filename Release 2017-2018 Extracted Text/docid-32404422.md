27 October 1993

NOTE FOR: D/CSI

FROM:

John Carver

SUBJECT: Answers for Dave Christian (and Jim Wolf, Reuter)

I gave Dave the following figures today, updating those

used by the DCI in his testimony to Congress on 28

could estimon

September, so he could be prepared to talk to the Reuter

reporter.

We did in fact transfer 125,000 pages of HSCA

sequestered Agency files on JEK to NARA by 22 August (a

Sunday), meeting the statutory deadline.

agency to meet the deadline. NARA made these available to

the public within a week.

As to the 20,000 pages of HSCA-originated material in

Agency files, HRG

was about half way through the review of

this when we

were overtaken by the higher priority placed by

the DCI on review of the Microfilm material. Thus,

processing

was interrupted, but will resume ASAP once the

microfilm job is complete.

(We do have the proper

authorization from Congress--the House Administration

Committee--but, physically, this material will be delivered

to NARA'S JFK Task Force, which is the agent for HAC.)

The story on the 7,000 pages of "third agency

material"--that originating in FBI and about 15 other

ยง is

agencies--is similar.

This, too,

was partly completed, but

is not our highest priority until the Microfilm job is done.

)dependen

in spee

As to the 10,000

pages of material earlier postponed ir

full in the first review, we can now say that 90 percent

it srel

will be released to NARA, but here again, processing has

been slowed by the Microfilm job. We will not make the date

suggested by the DCI in his testimony (28 October), kbut all

of this

should be done and transferred within a matter of

weeks, in any case certainly by 1 January.

The top priority job for HRG--the 150,000 pages of

material on microfilm--has all been printed out and all

available manpower is

concentrated on reviewing this massive

set of records.

We will be ready for Assassination Records

Review

Board examination of all this material by 1 January.

We still plan to ask

sources

and methods, and foreign sensitivities.

Journalists should be reminded that everything for

which the Agency will be asking for postponement under the

provisions of the JFK ARCA, both that denied in full and

that presented in sanitized form, will be shown in its

original unredacted state to the ARRB, without exception, as

required by the Act.

Thus, there will be an outside

authority making sure that

the Agency's requests for

continued protection of information fully meet the criteria

set down in the Act.
