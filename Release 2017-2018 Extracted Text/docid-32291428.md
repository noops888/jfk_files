ITAR - GAMBLING, ETC.

(DL 166-84)

On 4/23/63, Bureau Agents observed the automobiles

of MEADONS and his associate, BILLY RAY GRIMES, parked at the

subjects' gambling house on Copeland Road, north of Arlington,

Texas. On 4/23/63, in effort to locate and interview subject

DRISCOLL, Bureau Agents went to this gambling house and arrived

at about the time that GRIMES was pulling out of the drive in .

a station wagon, accompanied by his girl friend, JANICE

CHRISTAKIS.

GRIMES was asked to have DRISCOLL contact the

Dallas FBI Office and he stated he would but had not seen

DRISCOLL in over a month. This contact had followed a discussion

with USA, Dallas, who advised he believed there was a possible

violation by the subjects of the Federal anti-gambling statutes

in connection with the transportation of gambling debt funds from

Montana to Texas by DRISCOLL for MEADOWS and the cashing of a

cashiers check in Texas by the subjects, which check was a pay-

ment of a 51,500 gambling loss by JOE DAN TRIGG Of Oklahoma City

and which check was drawn on an Oklahoma city bank.
