MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: WIROGUE/l Mission to Kinshasa, December 1960

On 13 March 1975 a search of available documents was

made to determine the reason for the comment in paragraph 2

of a 17. December 1960 cable from Leopoldville indicating

hat WIROGUE/l had attempted to recruit a European to be :

member of "an execution sauad.'

The research did not clarify

this matter to any great extent, although some assumptions

can be made on the basis of circumstantial evidence.

WIROGUE/1 was an ethnic Georgian recruited

and trained

for the old REDSOSe program.

Although born in the

Union, he moved to lestern Europe when two years old.

In January 1961 Leopoldville asked for authority to

perait KIROGUE/1 to take flying

lessons so that the station

plane could be used for clandestine missions (the plane was

registered in YQCLAM/1's name).

Station acknowledged dis-

aurantage of crossing WIROGUE/1 and YOCLAM/1 operations

(YOCL1M/1 was never involved in any assassination schemes.

Headquarters approved flying lessons.

By March 1961 WIROGUE/1

hau obtained the position

of adviser to the Congolese Air

Force with the rank of Major and was almost immediately used

for the purpose of gathering intelligence on the Congolese

Air Force.

By April 1961 the Congolese were attempting use

himobtain arms and instructors in Western Europe.

April 1961 WIROGUE/1 was teaching the Congolese to fly

aircraft, although he himself had learned only several

months earlier and was reading navigation manuals at night

to stay ahead of his class.

Leopoldville because he had run into difficulty obtaining

a residence permit.

He was terminated in September 1961.

the polit-
