A review of records made available by Dominick

Edward Bartone, as previously reported in this casey disclosed

a letter dated March 22, 1961 to Bartone from Peter H./Clayton,

Chicago,

Illinois, which

vice-President Meissner Engineers, Inc. (MEI) 'Investigated

indicated MET had received and

a proposal by Bartone regarding the sale of Niagara Crushed

Stone (Humberstone), Ltd. (NCS) .

In regard to the subsequent

bankruptcy proceedings in Canada involving NCS, the Clarkson

Company by letter dated July 17, 1961 to MEI requested the

names of officers of NCS.

In that connection

a list of

officers showed Peter H. Clayton as President, and there also

an undated statement signed Peter H. Clayton indicating

he resigned as President of NCS

information regarding Peter H. Clayton has been received by

"on this date". The fodlowing pR,

MASS mex,

Clayton's true name was Peter Heinrich Klein, he-stin

born In Austria, he and his family were associated with and

sympathetic to

the Nazi cause during World War II, and he came

to this country from Vichy, Erance in late 1945 or early 1946.

He attended classes at Harvard University for three years

before being expelled for alleged homosexual tendencies, and

he had a record of homosexual arrests in New York City.

became associated with the campaign organization of President

Eisenhower and Vice-President Nixon and was reportedly under

the sponsorship of one Jack Whitney, supposedly a cousin of

Clayton.

In 1956 Clayton reportedly was General Counsel for

the "Citizens for Eisenhower" organization.

In 1957 Clayton was hired by MEI, Chicago, at a

salary of $20,000.00 a year plus a percentage bonus

for MEI. Clayton had many contacts in Central and South

America, and was fluent in English, German, French, and

Spanish. In 1958 Clayton traveled

primarily in Mexico,

Jamaica, San Juan, and Caracas.

In 1959 his travel was pri-

marily contined to central and

South America, but in both

and 195y Clayton made at least two trips to Europe.

In

connection with matters handled by Clayton at MEI, it was

subsequently discovered that there were fictitious memoranda

in the files supposedly originating from

ILL

President of MEI, requesting that Clayton travel tò Europe,

Mexico, San Salvador, Costa Rica, and Honduras.

It was also

noted that some of the incoming correspondence to Clayton at

MEI from Europe was incoherent on its face and presumably

was in code.

JFK Act 6 (4)

Clayton continued in the employ of MEI until

September 15, 1962 when he formed a company entitled Pan-

American Council for Engineering, for the purpose of servicing

MEI accounts on a contract basis.

This company was believed

to be a partnership between Clayton and a fictitious person

and was registered in Cook County, Illinois.

In 1960 Clayton had brought a friend by the name

ĐT P. ĐOK

XMaktos to MEI in Chicago.

Maktos, an alleged

attorney

from Cleveland, Ohio and

Boston, Massachusetts, was

accompanied

by Dominick

Edward Bartone,

with whom Clayton also

was acquainted. Bartone discussed with MEI officials the need

for an engineering survey of NCS in Canada. MEI conducted the

engineering survey and subsequently there were two or three

meetings in MEI's Chicago office regarding financial diffi-

culties of NCS. Present at these meetings were Clayton,

Bartone, Maktos, James Ganoom, Gregory Pahules, and Meissner.

Clayton claimed to be acquainted with Ben Cohen,

Tommy Cohen, Sam Kaye, Ben Dranow, Lou Poller, Bennie Hussick,

Dave Yaras,

and

James Hoffa.

This acquaintanceship resulted

from an allered loan from the Teamsters Pension Fund to Tommy

Cohen, from which Hoffa, Maktos, and Clayton were each

supposed to have received a $50,000.00 "kickback".

Clayton

political background and the fact that he was "of counsel"

for the firm of Javitz and

Javitz in New York. Hoffa allegedly

wanted Clayton to contact "Fuller Warren and Pepper" in an

attempt to form a strong political team to fight "Bobby"

Clayton reportedly also was friendly with or did

business with many prominent individuals in various parts of

the United States and other countries, including businessmen,

industrialists, public officials, and

politicians.

Clayton appeared to be knowledgeable in the field

of foreign banking and claimed to have opened bank accounts

in Mexico City and in Switzerland for various individuals.

On at least one trip to Europe, Clayton reportedly was

carrying at least $50,000.00 in cash for deposit in one of

these accounts.

In regard to Clayton's banking connections

in Switzerland he reportedly was in contact with Dr. Nicholas

Bar, Julius Bar and Company, Vahnhofstrasse 36, Zurich,

Switzerland. To conceal some of his financial

transactions

Clayton allegedly had created a non-existent person with a

name dissimilar to Clayton's, having a Post Office Box mailing

address on an island in the Bahamas,

and having bank accounts

there and elsewhere.

Clayton had indicated that such non-

existent persons could be utilized by making up aname, getting

a Social Security card in that name, opening a small bank

account, and subsequently obtaining a domestic air travel card

and other credit cards.

JFK Act 6 (4).

Clayton and Bartone allegedly had

obtain

a bank charter on Grand Cayman Island, British West Indies,

in 19610

Bartone had mentioned to Clayton that "they" had

started

a bank in Nassau, Bahamas, but "the feds blew it

right out of the water"

Bartone

claimed to be working on

"certain matters" with "Jimmy" Hoffa, and also said Grand

Cayman Island was an excellent location because he could do

business for and with the

head man of the Seafarers Inter-

national Union.
