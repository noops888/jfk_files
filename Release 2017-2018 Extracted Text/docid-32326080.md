DEPOSA HOUSER:

This case was assigned to me on 8/9/67.

• I

was on annual leave from 8/11/67 to 8/28/67.

Upon my return from leave I began

inmediate efforts to locate

JOSE CARDOSA, who had moved from

his last known address.

Considerable difficulty was encountered in locating his

current residence and then contacting him for interview,

as he was working as a truck driver and putting in mụch

overtine, making him unavailable for interview.

He was

interviewed as soon as I could locate him and

the results

of the interview were immediately reported. During this

period I was carrying a heavy case load in

the Latin American

field, averaging 42 cases each month.

I was aware the anti-CASTRO group with which

CARDOSA was formerly associated, the ECA, was inactive both

in Chicago and in Miami from infornation

available, and

Miami was known to have coverage of this organization, which

would logically make known any renewal of activity by

I also considered the fact that no additional infor-

mation concerning renewal of activity had bacome known from

any source during the ensuing period from the time Detroit

first received the information in question.

• With these

factors in mind, the inquiry concerned seemed less signifi-

cant than if we were dealing with an active organization.

These were

the factors

on which I based my decision

to handle

this matter as I did.

I now realize the significance of the informa-

tion received from the

Detroit Division could best be evaluated

by the Bureau and Miami and that investigation to completely

resolve this matter should have been initiated. I appreciate

the observations of the Inspector,

and his instructions

will be immediately carried out.

I regret my misjudgment

in this instance and give every assurance that I will take

every measure to diligently handle each and every matter

in the future with due dispatch and thoroughness to explore

to the fullest all ramifications of any fact or allegation

under investigation.

SA DUFF:

On 11/17/67 I was relieving on the S-4 Desk in

absence of the supervisor on annual leave.

recall the matter in question and remember discussing with

SA HOUSER the delay in the interview, and he advised me

along the

same lines set forth above.

I was aware of his

case load, as well as the problems encountered in locating

Cubans generally in Chicago, as they are all predisposed

to shift jobs and residences frequently.

In

these factors, I considered his reasons for the delay reason-

able.

I authorized the closing of this case on a memor

andum to the SAC, based upon information set forth from the

interview of CARDOSA concerning the inquiry in question and

being also aware of the coverage available by Miami of the

group in question. I also noted that in the period from

the initial receipt of this information by the Detroit Divi-

sion until this time no corroborative information of

_SUPERVISOR RANDY:

I appreciate the observations and instruc

tions of the Inspector in this case

and these instructions will be immediately carried out.

I realize the importance of this matter and that it should

have been given more expeditious and thorough handling.

I assumed supervision of the S-4 Squad on 10/2/57, and I

am positive that ison this date to the date the case in

question was closed. I did not see this particular file.

This case should have come up on tickler on one occasion

during this period for desk review. I note that on-the-

spot supervision took me away from

the desk for four hours
