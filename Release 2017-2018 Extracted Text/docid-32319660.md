Title 50, United States Code, Section

781 (Internal Security Act of 1950)

stated that, as a result of evidence

adduced before various committees of

the Senate and House of Representatives,

Congress found the existence of a world

communist revolutionary movement, whose

purpose is to establish a communist

totalitarian dictatorship in the world's

countries through the medium of a world-

wide communist organization. Communist

action organizations in various countries

endeavor to carry out the objectives of

the world communist movement by bringing

about the overthrow of existing governments

by any means.

The communist organization

in the United States -- the CPUSA --

pursuing its stated objectives, presents

"a clear and present danger to the security

of the United States."

The Subversive

Activities Control Board, established by

Section 791 of the above

Act, found the

CPUSA to be a communist action organization.

This finding was upheld by the United States

Supreme Court in June, 1961.

The CPUSA

has continued to be an arm of the inter

national communist movement dominated by

the Soviet Union.

The CPUSA, in its

dependence on the Soviet Union, has never

knowingly adopted a position contrary to

Soviet policy.

Its leaders frequently

confer with Soviet leaders to receive

guidance and direction on the policies

the CPUSA is to follow.

There has been

no evidence that the primary aims of the

CPUSA, as they conform to Soviet objectives,

have

changed over the years.

The investigation revealed Mr. and Mrs. Rudder

were active members of the CPUSA from the early 1950s to

1967 •

During this period Mr. and Mrs. Rudder participated

in numerous demonstrations organized by the CPUSA or

Washington, D. C., on several occasions.

During the

early 1960s, Mr.

and Mrs. Rudder considered living and

working in the Union of

the Soviet Socialist Republica

and contacted the Soviet Embassy, Washington, D. C.,

concerning this matter.

From the mid 1950s to the mid 1960s,

Mr. and Mrs. Rudder actively supported a communist-

dominated private school in Washington, D. C., in which

they enrolled their children.

Since 1967, no information has been obtained

concerning their active participation within the CPUSA

and their current status is unknown.

A security-type investigation was initiated

by the FBI in 1966 concerning Miss Rudder's brother,

Bugene John Rudder, based on his parents' activities within

Since 1969, no information has been obtained

concerning his membership in the CPUSA and' his current

status is unknown.

Agency Check

The files of the FBI, Including the files of the

Identilication Division, contain no additional pertinent

information concerning Miss Rudder.

Laura Mae Holt

Mr. Sprague noted that Mr. Lehner had told him

that he, Mr. Lehner, considers Miss

Holt to be a "trouble-

maker" because Miss

Holt was reportedly telling black

congressional members of the committee that Mr. Lehner was

racially biased and motivated. He said Mr. Lehner informed

him Miss Holt had

a tendency to go on a tangent of her own

concerning the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., assassination

investigation and

to pursue the tangents, which Mr. Lehner

believed in many instances had no relevancy to the

gation. He said he had the distinct feeling that

investi-

Mr. Lehner wanted him to transfer Miss Holt from

Mr. Lehner's investigative team.

Mr. Sprague stated that in his direct contacts

with Miss Holt he had no reason to question her ability.

He said he recalls Miss Holt's asking relevant and important

questions at meetings he had with members of the

ox. Martin Luther King, Jr., assassination investigation

team.

He said he

had intended to look into the situation

posed to him by Mr. Lehner concerning Miss Holt's performance,

but he did not have

the opportunity to do so.

He said he

had somewhat hesitated to look into the situation because

he wanted to avoid any further confrontations with members

of this committee.

He said that based upon his own personal

observations of Miss Holt, he has no reason whatsoever to

question her

character, associates, reputation, or loyalty.

He said

he is reluctant to recommend Miss Holt for a posi-

tion of trust and confidence with the United States Government

because Mr. Lehner's statements concerning Miss Holt's

performance as a member of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,

assassination investigation team have made him cautious.

Robert J. Lehner, Deputy Chief Counsel, Select

Committee on Assassinations, United States House of Represen-

tatives, Washington, D. C., advised he has been acquainted

with Miss Holt on a

limited professional basis since

January, 1977.

He said he did not interview or hire

Miss Holt for her present position with the committee, noting

that this

was done by Richard A. Sprague. He said he

super -

vises eight to ten individuals, and Miss Holt is one of

these individuals. He said he has had no conflict with

Miss Holt; however, he did not wish to comment concerning

Miss Holt's character, associates, reputation, or loyalty.

He recommended Miss Holt for a position of trust and confi-

dence with the United States Government.

Twenty-eight additional persons, consisting of
