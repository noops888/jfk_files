THE MINUTEMEN

ERNEST AVANTS, Natchez, Mississippl, is very interested

in the Minutenen Organization and talks a great deal about

revolution. He does not seem interested in actually joining

the Minutemen.

It is believed that a man named (FNU) GUTHRIE in

Ferriday, Louisiana, has tried for sometime to join the Minutemen

and has recently been tentatively accepted for membership.

It has been brought out that each Minuteman knows only

four other members of the organization.

MISCELLANEOUS

There has been no discussion or indication among members

of the WKKKKOM that any new organization is being formed in which

the members would wear uniforms or be required to own highpowered

rifles.

There has been no discussion or indication of knowledge

among members of the WKKKKIM in the Adams County, Mississippi, •

area, with regard to the burning of the COFO House at Indlanola,

Mississippi, recently.

JULIUS HARPER, BILLY BUCKLES and SAM BOWERS have discussed

at length the manner in which the bodies of the three slain civil

rights workers in Neshoba County, Mississippi, were discovered. It

is the consensus opinion among these individuals that the bodles

were found as a result of a lucky guess on the part of Agents after

seeing fresh dirt from a helicoptor flying over the area in which

the bodies were found.
