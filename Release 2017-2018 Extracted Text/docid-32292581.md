SPECIAL INVESTIGATIV- DIVISION

(In connection with the Swiss Government's

ban on the entrance of Chicago hoodlum Gus

Alex into Switzerland, the Chicago Crime

Commission was contacted by the Swiss

Consulate General's Office in Chicago for

background and activities of Alex.) After

spending two hours in the Chicago Crime

Commission's files, the representative

expressed amazement at the available

material showing hoodlum activity and

association with Alex. He indicated he

intends to recommend a continuation of the

ften-year ban against Alex. )

Alex has been vigorously resisting the

Swiss efforts to continue this ban.
