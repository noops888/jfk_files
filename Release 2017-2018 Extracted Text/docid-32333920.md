RE:

OTHERWISE

DL 21=S, on 11/19/68, orally advised SA KUYKENDALL

that HARRY KOGER, of San Antonio, Texas, telephoned J. C.

BECKWORTH, Route

1, Tatum, Texas, on 11/2/68, asking whether

the Tatum

School District had reinstated any of the Negro

teachers who had lost their jobs there; also whether any

message had been received from Mr. BILLUP of the National

Education Association (NEA), Dallas, Texas; also whether the

school district had made any offer to place the teachers

back

on the payroll. He also wanted to know if BECKWORTH had been

back to Houston to contact anyone there to tell his story

about his being let out as principal of Mayflower School, Tatum

District, before his contract expired. KOGER told BECKWORTH

the first one he wanted BECKWORTH to see was RONNIE DUGGER,

who lived in Houston but had now moved to Austin, Texas.

KOGER told BECKWORTH that if the teachers wanted

KOGER's

assistance, he would return to Tatum and give them all the

assistance

he could. KOGER said H. C. THOMPSON, former

Mayflower School bus driver, had lost his job also. (THOMPSON

was not reassigned at the beginning of the September, 1968

school year.)

KOGER

said he felt sure the teachers would win

out and would either

get their jobs back or be paid for their

lost time..

KOGER asked BECKWORTH to telephone him to let him
