a that to have been presto:

covered and reported by the Chicago Division.

It is also to be noted that the Chicago Division

is now carrying TOM ACKERMAN, Insurance Examiner, Bureau of

Liquidation, Illinois State Department of Insurance, as a

PCI. This is nécessitated by the fact that Mr. ACKERNAN

advised that IRVIN WEINER has now taken over the office of

the Bureau of Liquidation, Illinois State Department of

Insurance:

This was accomplished by the removal of Mr.

ALBERT VERB,, after which WEINER was influential in placing

CLARENCE E. MALLOY and FRANCESKTAGUE in this office.

Mr. ACKERMAN also advised that

on January 9, 1964, IRVIN

WEINER placed a clerk, PATRICIA/MOFFETT,

who resides in

Downers Grove, Illinois, on the staff of the Bureau of

Liquidation, Illinois State Department of Insurance.

Mr. ACKERMAN pointed out that MALLOY and TAGUE

have asked him such questions as the identity of the

various government agencies who have made inquiry and

have reviewed the records of the Central Casualty Company.

They have also asked Mr. ACKERMAN if the information

located in these files would in any way implicate IRVIN

WEINER in regards to this matter.

Mr. ACKERMAN has

expressed the opinion that he believes the only reason

that MALLOY and TAGUE are in the office of the Bureau of

Liquidation is to protect the interest of IRVIN WEINER.

Mr. ACKERMAN pointed out that the name of FELIX ALDERISIO

has not been discussed to date by either MALLOY or TAGUE.

INFORMANTS

CG 6588-C-TE advised SA RUSSELL R. GIRSCH on

December 13, 1963, that FELIX ALDERISIO is instructing his

associates that it is all right to threaten people, but do not

hit them.

ALDERISIO has never referred to his Miami, Florida,

lawyer by name. However, he mentioned that this lawyer was

in connection with the Miami case and

remarked that Chicane, attorney GEORGE EE WERE PoLy

$20,000 in addition to his regular

fee.

On December 20, 1963, CG 6588-C-TE advised SA RUSSELL

R. GIRSCH that FELIX ALDERISIO furnished the name of his

Miami attorney as being O. B.XCLINE

art tie organ as a christmas present.

ALDERISIO stated that he was of the opinion that CLINE did

not have this case quashed prior to his arraignment as he

was afraid that if he did, he would not get the $20,000.

ALDERISIO indicated that he paid CLINE a lesser amount to

handle this case.

ALDERISIO has also indicated that
