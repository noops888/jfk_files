Careful consideration has been given to the use of

symbols in this report and they have been used only in those

instances where it is necessary to conceal the source.

Detroit Intormante DE 370-C, DE 878-C-TE, DE 889-C-TE,

and DE 906-C* have furnished considerable information in the

past which cumulatively reflects good over-all coverage of

the Detrolt "Family", but every effort is being made to develop

new sources which can authoritatively define the organization

in the light of current organizational: changes.i. It is to be

noted that the local organization appears to be undergoing a

ZILLI, reported

"Commission" member and

the "older statesman" becoming more inctive while the second

generation leadership is apparently beginning to take over.

It has not been authoritativoly determined whethet the organization

of the Detroit "Syndicate", including non-Itallans,

coincides

in all respects with the organization

01 "Causa Nostra".
