Enclosed are the original and seven copies of an LHM

dated and captioned as above.

The informant mentioned in the LHM is NY 4047-S*.

The memorandum is classified "Confidential" because

it contains information from NY 4047-S*

The Washington Field Office is requested to contact

the Fassport Division

U. S. Department of State, to determine

-he status of the subiects

passport application.

Since the possibility exists that the subject may be

going to Israel for other purposes than to accompany her father

and since these other purposes may be quite significant in deter-

mining the scope of her Chinese Communist activitles, the Bureau 1s

requested to consider contacting the U. S. Denartment of State so

that the subject may receive her passport.

It is

to be noted that

Israel maintains diplomatic

Peking, andit would be quite significant it the

subject contacted the

diplomatic establishment in Israel
