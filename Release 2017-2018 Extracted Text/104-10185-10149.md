Operational Departments.

Of the eight departments making up the headquarters, three are

four are concerned with operational support or

training, and one is administrative.

The three operational de-

partments are Legal Centers (Contros Legales - NS). Illegal

(Ilegal), and National Liberation (Liberacion Nacional - LN);

the last two were formerly a single department, known as MA

(Intelligence).

All three departments handle operations abroad

for the purpose of collecting information on the host country.

Their operations are distinguished by two factors,

legal connectiors and Communist Party-leftist group liaison.

The Departmen: of Legal Centers is responsible for operations

conducted through Cuban official missions in countries with which

Cuba has diplomatic relations and has normally nothing to do with

illegal agents. The other two departments handle illegal agents,

both in countries with which Cuba has relations and in those with

which she has none.

•The Illegal Department has no connection

with Communist Parties or organized leftist croups abroad; the

National Liberation Department deals mainly with such parties

and groups; the Department of Legal Centers may work with them

or unilaterally.

All three departments are organized in geo-

graphical divisions with area

desks for each country within

their respective fields or

responsibility; there is thus some

overlapping in desk coverage.

The DGI has two types of overseas intelligence operations (as

distinct from guerrilla warfare

operations covered below in

paragraphs 19 and 20):

legal field stations and illegal agents.

The legal field station exists in every country with which. Cuba

has diplomatic relations; its porsonnel are members of the local

stations vary

depending on local objectives and

the quality of diplomatic relations.

In Soviet Bloc countries,

for example, field stations are usually small, with only one or

two officers, who have no intelligence collection or similar

responsibility but are charged principally with aiding travelers

o Cuba and with liaison with the local intelligence service.

In countries outside the Soviet Bloc, legal field stations have

various responsibilities; in Latin America, their principal a-

civities are promotion and direction of

and arrangements for guerrilla varfere. lubversion and sabotage

The largest field

station is in Mexico, which is important because it is a major

transit point for both personnel and materials, and because it

is a contact point for any leftist organization of any country

which has representatives in Mexico. Naterial for other latin
