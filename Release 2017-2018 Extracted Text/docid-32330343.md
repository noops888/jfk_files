the data furnished this Division concerning subject points to a

possible violation, if the facts were proved, of a law within the

The information furnished in a memorandum dated June 5, 1959 at

Washington, D.C. and captioned Anti-Fidel Castro Activities points to

a possible violation, if the allegations contained therein were proved

by competent and legally sufficient evidence.

Rojas, Justo Luis Pozo del. Puerto, and Pedro Diaz have entered into

to effect the object of the conspiracy is committed, such as the

gathering together of individuals under such circumstances as to

make clear that they were about to engage in an expedition against

Cuba from the United States, there could be a conspiracy to violate

Section 960.
