among a group of 5 individuals who made two unsuccesa ful

attempts to fly into Cuba in order to discharge certain

passengers.

On April 5, 1963. U.S. Customs Service, Miami,

seized an American motor vessel,

the VIOLYN III, on

grounds there was probable cause to believe that arms

and munitions of war had been exported or removed from

the United States in violation of law, aboard this boat.

This vessel had been purchased by ALEXANDER I. RORKE,

a United States citizen, newspaper photographer and ad-

venturer; who had been closely assoclated with FIORINI In

anti-CASTRO activities.

(RORKE disappeared in 1963 after

departing South Florida by plane on a trip to Mexico, and

is presumed to be dead.)

FRANK FIORINI and WILLIAM JOHNSON advised U.s.

Customs that due to arrangements made with RORKE, they had

committed this boat to the use of an anti-CASTRO organ-

Ization known as Los Pinos Nuevos.

They admitted that

they had loaded the vessel with three 100 pound bombs,

and proceeded to Norman Key in the Bahama Islands, where

the bonba were hidden, pursuant to a plan for a later

attack againat Cuba.
