FY 77; Spring Planning Call

DATE: February 14, 1975

Attached is a copy of the Department of Justice FY 77. Spring Planning

Call which outlines the requirements for the formulation of your FY 77. budget

request.

In recent weeks, you and your staff have been contacted by members

of the Office of Management and Finance to elicit your experiences during the

FY 76. MBO/Budget cycle and your views of how the process could be improved.

We have attempted to address the problems which were identified throughout

the Department and to make those changes which will simplify and improve the

MBO/Budget process. These changes do not deviate from the philosophy and

concepts of management-by-objectives but, rather, attempt to eliminate some

of the formulation and analytical problems experienced in the FY 76 cycle.

One of the innovations for FY 77, is that organizations will not be

required to submit objectives for their entire range of activities. In FY 77,

we will be more interested in soliciting objectives in selected program areas.

It remains each program manager's responsibility to identify objectives which

have the most importance for his organization and highlight those specific

objectives which could be of presidential level interest.

You should also

be prepared to develop your objectives in response to policy guidelines that

may be subsequently issued by the Attorney General.. In addition, you should

be prepared to define objectives in program areas which are of particular

interest to the Department; you will be advised of these designated program

areas within the next three weeks.

Twenty copies of your FY 77. Spring planning submission should be trans-

mitted by April 14, 1975 to the Assistant Attorney General for Administration.

The Office of Management and Finance will provide staff assistance in imple-

menting these instructions.

PREFACE

In February 1974, the Attorney General promulgated the Depart-

ment of Justice Management-by-Objectives (MBO) system. As indicated

in the MBO Handbook, the Department's MBO system was designed to be

introduced in phases: in FY 76, the budget and the MBO submissions

were concurrent; the FY

77 Spring Planning Call, which is the second

phase of the Department's MBO system, integrates the MBO submission

into the budgetary process through the Department's program structure.

The. FY 77 Spring Planning Call also contains several changes in re-

porting requirements which will hopefully minimize the formulation

and analytical difficulties experienced in the FY 76 MBO/Budget process.

N7ll be facing in the coming years, it is essential that the Depart-

nent carefully analyze and prioritize its resource reauirements sc

that it may compete effectively with other Government agencies for

available financial resources.

PART I

GENERAL INFORMATION AND POLICIES

A. INTRODUCTION

The Department of Justice's FY 77 planning and budget cycle will

reflect changes in the scheduling, the number of submissions required

Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974.

During the FY 77 cycle there will be four distinct calls for sub-

missions of information:

the FY 77 Spring Planning Call which is the

Department of Justice's management and planning instrument; the FY 77

Call for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) submission; the

Current Services Budget Call which is a new requirement of the Con-

gressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974; and the FY 77

Congressional Estimates Call. Appendix A outlines the major events

in the FY 77 planning and budget cycle.

B. SPRING PLANNING CALL

The first of these calls, the FY 77 Spring Planning Call, is

addressed in detail below.

Organizations will submit twenty (20

copies of their Spring Planning Submission to the Assistant Attorney

General for Administration by April 14, 1975. The Department's

hearings on FY 77 program plans, objectives and proposed budgets are

scheduled to begin in mid-May 1975 and will continue through mid-June

1975. Organizations will be advised in April regarding the final

Department hearing schedule.

C. OMB SUBMISSION CALL

The second call for the traditional OMB submission will be issued

by the Department in late July 1975; this call will request organizations

to prepare the FY 77 OMB submission.

The OMB submission will be prepared

on the basis of Department budget marks approved by the Attorney General,

subsequent to the Spring review hearings.

These Department marks will be

communicated to the organizations by late July 1975, and the Department

will consider appeals up to ten days after the communication of the in-

ternal marks. The Department's FY 77 budget estimates must be submitted

to OMB by September 30, 1975.

Pending approval.of the Department's pro-

gram activity structure (see

Appendix B), the Department expects the

FY 77 OMB budget submission to conform to the presently approved budget

activities.

## Page 11

D. CURRENT SERVICES BUDGET CALL

The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 re-

quires the submission or a current services buaget which will be the

subject of the third call of the FY 77 cycle.

The FY 77 Current Ser-

vices Budget must be submitted by OMB to the Congress by November 10,

1975. Details for preparing the Current Services Budget will be for-

warded as soon as the Department receives OMB's instructions.

E. CONGRESSIONAL ESTIMATES CALL

The normal call for Congressional Estimates for FY 77 will be issued

by the Department to organizations by early January 1976. The exact date

of this call is a function of when OMB's final decisions on the FY 77

budget are received by the Department.

F. NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SPRING PLANNING CALL

Based on the experience of the FY 76 MBO/Budget cycle, several

refinements have been made to the Department's MBO/Budget system which

will increase its utility to the Department's resource allocation

decision making process.

1.

Single Submission - The FY 77 Spring Planning Submission

will differ in a number of significant ways from the FY 76

MBO/Budget Submission.

The most obvious change is the re-

quirement for a single submission of program and budget

data organized in a Department-wide, program activity

structure.

Each organization will display its total re

sources against the relevant portions of the Department's

program activity structure; Appendix B contains the Depart-

ment of Justice program activity structure with an explana-

tion of each part of the structure.

Treatment of Objectives - The treatment of objectives and

their supporting cost data will also change in the ry 11

Spring Planning Call.

The basic concepts embodied in the

Jou management-by-objective system, as articulated in Do

Order 3210.1A, dated May 1, 1974, remain the same. Objec-

tives still must be impact oriented and stated in measurable

1 Title VI. Sec. 605(a) of Public Law 93-344 requires a current

services budget covering estimates of financing required to carry on

existing programs in the budget year at the same level as the current

fiscal year. The Congress has indicated that it will review data by

agency, by functional program categories and major programs withir

functional program categories.

HH 55299

DocId: 32989691 Page 11

## Page 12

terms. The significant difference, however, is that

the total cost of all program objectives planned for

FY 77 do not have to add up to the total organization

budget, nor do the objectives reported under a single

program have to add up to the total costs of that program.

This means that while some programs may have objectives

which reflect the total or a significant percentage of

the program costs, other programs may not require objective

statements to be submitted to the Department.

3.

Direct and Indirect Costs - Another difference between the

FY 77 Spring Planning Submission and the FY 76 MBO/Budget

Submission is the treatment of direct and indirect costs.

The spreading of indirect costs across all programs will

no longer be required because two of the six major

categories of the Department's program activity structure

are designed to capture the majority of the indirect costs

of Department programs. These categories are: Department

Progrom Direction and Organization Program Direction.

Go PROGRAM NARRATIVE

Each organization's submission must include a narrative explanation

and justification as well as detailed financial analysis information

for all FY 77 on-going programs and new program initiatives.

Programs

or significant activities within programs which were on-going in Fy 76,

but which will be terminated during FY 77, should also be noted in the

program narrative along with the reasons for termination.

•Narrative statements about programs should be concise, informative

and factual.

Organizations should avoid using generic, vague or turgid

language to

describe their programs.

Ho RESOURCE REQUESTS •

The funds, positions, and manpower estimates contained in the FY 76

Congressional Budget, adjusted for changes including the three month

transition budget period, is the base for allocating resources to FY 77

programs.

See Appendix C for approved definitions of uncontrollables

for use in adjusting the FY 76 base resource levels.

I. FRAMEWORK OF OBJECTIVES

The Attorney General will be issuing a set of Department policy

guidelines. These guidelines should be used as a framework for the

formulation of priority program objectives for FY 77. Each organiza-

tion head is also responsible for identifying objectives which high-

-3 -

## Page 13

Tight the major program initiatives for his organization. In addition,

some organizations will

be directed to submit specific program objec-

tives for program areas of Department level interest.

J. FORMAT CONVENTIONS

The spring planning submission from all organizations must adhere to

the following format conventions:

1. Type on only one side of the paper.

2. Beginning with the table of contents, number the pages of

the submission sequentially without an alphabetic prefix.

Page numbers should be centered at the bottom of the page.

3. Single space all narrative material. Type in block style.

4. Make no pen or pencil corrections in the submission.

Have all material reduced where necessary and printed on a

10 1/2 inch by 8 inch page.

6.

Assemble without staples or clips.

8.

Punch for standard three-ring binders as follows: three

holes across 10 1/2 inch side of paper, 3/8 inch drill.

Dollar amounts shall be rounded to the nearest thousand.

However, notwithstanding the rounding, all columns for

all fiscal years should add to the correct totals.

PROGRAM PYRAMID

Organizations are required to submit a FY 77 program pyramid that

reflects only that portion of the Department's program activity structure

applicable to them.

Total obligations and total position data should be

shown for each level of the program activity structure and should aggre-

gate to each succeedingly higher level of the pyramid, i.e., totaling

to the organization's full FY 77 request. A general mission statement

will be required only at the top of the program pyramid.

Appendix D contains an example of the Department's program struc-

ture applied to the Immigration and Naturalization Service's (I&NS)

program pyramid.

Page 1 of Appendix D details the program pyramid thru

the area level of the program activity structure.

The element and sub-

element levels are simply outlined below the appropriate program activity

ared.

The following page expands one of the I&NS program activity areas

by detailing the elements and subelements. The other areas should be

detailed in the same manner.

D. SUMMARY PROGRAM NARRATIVE

A summary program narrative will be submitted as part of the FY 77

submission.

This narrative offers each organization the opportunity

to highlight its overall program direction and to discuss the relation-

ships between its programs. The summary program narrative should be

limited to a maximum of three single spaced pages.

E. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS SUMMARY

The Financial Analysis Summary is an

analysis of changes in budget

authority and total obligations from year to year and will begin with

the FY 75 Budget (see Appendix E). Changes will be shown from FY 75

to the FY 76 Congressional Budget; from the FY 76 Congressional Budget

to the transition budget base year, i.e., Fy 76 Congressional Budget

adjusted for the interim three month period of July l to September 30,

1976; and from the transition budget base year to the budget year.

Changes will be shown under the headings listed below, with a brief

explanation of each entry.

• Significant items should be shown separately:

small items may be grouped

as "other decreases" or "other increases."

Decreases will be listed under the following headings:

1. Profity be ease eductions in the wantients

or terminations.

Non-Recurring Items - Decreases in workload and non-

recurring items from the previous year, including full

amounts for construction, major equipment purchases,

major systems development, etc.

Transfers Out - Activities to be financed by another

organization in the succeeding year; all relevant

dollars, manyears and positions should be reflected.

Increases will be displayed under the following headings:

HH 55299

DocId: 32989691 Page 15

-6 -

---

## Page 16

1. Uncontrollables - Increased pay costs, other mandatory

costs,

and workload increases over which the organization

has no control under existing laws and policy.

Program Increases - All discretionary program increases

over which the organization exercises control.

3.

Transfers In - Activities financed by another organiza-

tion in

the preceding year; all relevant dollars, man-

years and positions should be reflected.

F. DETAILED PROGRAM AND BUDGET DATA

1..

General Program Information - Detailed justification data

will be required for each program. A program is defined

as the lowest program activity structure level applicable

for each organization.

The program narrative will include

program description, major outputs and clients served, pro-

gram justification, legislation affecting the program,

evaluation, workload and manyear data, program resource

requirements and, if applicable, program objective state-

ments.

•

Reporting Level - Program narratives are required

to describe the lowest level of the program activity

structure.

The lowest program activity structure

level is defined at the subcategory level if there

is no program activity area(s) under, the subcategory;

it is defined at the area level it there are no pro-

gram activity element levels: it is defined at the

element level if there is no

• subelement(s). It is

defined at the subelement level whenever there is a

subelement in the structure.

Program Iitle - This title should be taken from the

Department program structure in Appendix B. The

.:.

title is composed of an alpha-numeric prefix followed

by the program name. Below is an example of how the

title is formed when the program activity subelement

2. Program Narrative - The program narrative has eight parts,

T.e., the program description, major outputs and clients

served, program justification, legislation affecting the

program, evaluation, workload and manyear data, program

resource requirements and, if applicable, program objec-

tive statements.

Program Description - The program description should

be concise and factual. Organizations must use simple,

straightforward language in describing program plans.

The program description should try to address the

following key issues:

a. The purpose of the program;

b. The planned FY 77 impacts on public problems

addressed by the program;

c. Program impacts to date;

d. How program plans will be achieved;

e. Program alternatives which have been considered;

f.

Justification for the selection of this program

alternative;

g.

The risks and uncertainties which may affect the

success of this program;

h.

The amount of coordination and joint planning

with other Department organizations or other

government agencies required to assure program

success;

## Page 18

j.

Identification of programs or activities within

the programs which are being terminated or

curtailed;

New program initiatives planned for FY 77.

This section of the program submission should not exceed

one single spaced typewritten page for each program.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served - Organiza-

tions should list the major program outputs and clients

served.

Program Justification - The justification should briefly

cite specific legislation, Executive Orders, Department

Orders, or other policy statements and directives which

support the program's continuance, initiation or termina-

tion.

If none of the above support a given program,

organizations should justify the program from their

perception of national need or the impact the program

has on solving public problems.

Legislation Affecting the Program - This section should

briefly address any changes to existing legislation

or proposals for new legislation which would increase

the probability of program success. If there is a

proposal to terminate or curtail a program, specify

any changes to legislation required in order to

terminate or curtail the program. If the program

not require either new legislation or changes

to existing legislation, organizations should state

that no legislative changes are required.

Evaluation of On-going Programs - Cite the most

recently completed formal evaluation of the program's

effectiveness and impact, i.e., the evaluation title

and any other nomenclature which would aid in re-

questing the evaluation report. If there is formal

evaluation currently in progress, describe briefly

the evaluation process and the scheduled completion

If this program has not been formally evaluated

da terms of effectiveness and impact within the last

three years, so state.

Workload and Manyear Data - Organizations must sub-

mit workload and manyear data for each program: this

data may be estimated if actual data is not available.

- ₴ -

HH 55299

DocId: 32989691

## Page 19

3.

Workload data supporting each program, when appropriate,

will be formated as indicated in Appendix F. Only

major program outputs need be reported. If a program

has more than one major output, actual or estimated

manyears should be allocated between the outputs.

Workload data for existing programs must include

FY 72-77. Workload data for new programs should

be estimated for FY 77-81.

Program Resource Requests - Resource requests are

required for the FY 77 planning period and in certain

cases for the five year planning period.

Resource re-

quests must be submitted at the lowest levels of the

program activity structure applicable for the organization.

•

Program Resource Requirements for Budget Planning

Perrod - Urganizations will summarize and display

total manyears, positions and funds by only those

major object classes required by the program for

FY 75-FY 77, including the interim three months

July 1 through September 30, 1976. Appendix G

contains a sample exhibit of the summary of pro-

gram resource requirements for a program utiliz-

ing all the major object classes.

In addition, organizations must provide a narra-

tive explanation of change for both FY 76/75 and

for FY 77/76. Explanations should focus on the

rationale for the change and not merely on the

specifics of the change. The explanation of change

lever at a minimum, occur at major object class

It would be preferable for organizations

to explain resource changes by major items within

the object class. The explanation must also include

the identification of manyears and positions by

major personnel category, i.e., agents, investiga-

tors, attorneys, clerks, etc.

Uncontrollable increases

should be specified. Non-recurring costs should be

identified.

Program cost increäses should be identi-

fied as specifically as possible, e.g., purchase of

new equipment by type, increased manyears by grade

and program activities, printing increases,

increases

for supplies, vehicles, rents for buildings, equip-

ment rentals or leases, non-governmental and govern-

mental service contracts.

Program Resource Requirements for Five Year Planning

Period - Certain program efforts which have rela-

tively small first year start-up costs often lead

to successively higher costs in the succeeding

years.

If any program has significant long range

HH 55299

---

## Page 20

cost escalation built into present decisions to

proceed with the program effort, organizations

should estimate such future year costs through at

least the budget year plus four years, 1.e., FY 77-81.

Future year costs should be estimated for program

efforts such as:

a.

Large scale construction projects, i.e.,

$1,000, 000 or greater per year;

b. Large scale modernization or rehabilitation

of physical plants, i.e., $500,000 or

greater per year;

c.

Research and development projects, i.e.,

$250,000 or greater per year;

e.

Large scale automated systems development

and implementation projects, i.e., $250,000

or greater per year;

Large scale network communications system

improvements, i.e.,

$250,000 or greater per

year;

f.

g.

Large scale capital equipment purchases apart

from normal replacement of obsolete capital

equipment, i.e., $250,000 or greater per year;

Programs which are projected to have large

increases in manpower, i.e., 10 percent per

vear over the five vear period.

•Program Objectives - Program objectives are specific state-

program manager should achieve and be accountable for during

The program objectives are aimed

at ensuring accomplishment of the program mission and aiding

in the accomplishment of the organization's and the Depart-

element in the FY 76 submission.

Treatment of Objectives - Unlike FY 76, the resources

allocated to achieving program objectives for a given

program do not have to reflect the total resource

- 11 -

HH 55299

DocId: 32989691

## Page 21

request for the program. For a given program there

may be an objective or set of objectives which consume

resources equal to the total resource requirements of

a program, or the resources associated with an objective

or set of objectives may consume less than 100% of

a program's resources.

Organization management may

determine that certain programs have no objectives

of Department management import.

When identifying program objectives, organizations should

keep the following criteria in mind:

a.

Every program objective must clearly support

the program under which it is stated.

b.

Program objectives may support more than one

program but must be clearly identified under

each of the programs which they support.

c.

Program objectives should generally be achiey-

able within the budget year.

d.

Program objectives must clearly impact upon

the program which they support. The impaci

should be quantifiable or otherwise be

The expendi-

ture of funds or other resources is not an

acceptable measure of a program objective's

impact.

e.

If qualitative measures of effectiveness are

used to judge a program objective's impact,

then the base standard of quality and the

desired new standards of quality should be

Programs Requiring Objectives - Program objectives are

required for a program when:

a.

Attorney General policy guidelines indicate

the requirement for a program objective to

execute the policy guidelines;

b.

An organization has been directed by the

Department to submit a program objective;

c.

A new program is being initiated;

H7 55299 DocId: 32989691 Page 21

~ 12 .

---

## Page 22

•

d.

A major new program effort within an existing

program is being initiated;

e.

A substantial change in program thrust occurs

in an on-going program;

f.

An increase of $1,000,000 or 15 percent is

requested in FY 77 over FY 76; the lower of

the two would generate the need for a

program objective.

Program objectives need not be limited to these six

requirements,

i.e., they can and should reflect other

on-going program efforts, especially when those pro-

grams are of high priority to the organization. Pro-

gram objectives not only assist the manager in

targeting his resources but also serve to inform De-

partment management, organization personnel and the

public of the directions the organization intends to

take and the impact it intends to have.

The decision

to submit objectives should not be based solely on the

amount of resources required for that program, 1.e.,

program objectives are a good means of setting forth

significant management improvement efforts even though

relatively few program resources may be required.

Content and Format of Objective Statements - Each

program objective except for multi-program objec-

tives will be documented in the following order and

format:

a.

Program Objective Statement - This is a one

sentence statement which clearly expresses the

program objective.

b.

Accountable Program Manager - Organizations

should name the program manager who has direct

responsibility for achievement of the program

objective. The following information should be

Jiven: the program manager's name, positior

title, and organizational unit

c.

Program Objective Resource Requirements - The

following information is required: manyears,

positions, and total dollars.

Program Objective Description - This section

includes a brief description of the objective's

intended impact and the measure of effectiveness

• 13 ..

HH 55299

which will be used to determine the impact. In

addition, the description should also include

the assumptions upon which the program objec-

Key Milestones - Milestones are the major steps

which constitute an action plan toward achieving

the program objective.

These will be listed in

chronological order and will show

• the logical

sequence of events that are planned toward the

achievement of the objective.

Milestones are

to be output and not impact oriented; their accom-

plishment should be used by the organization as

measures of performance and not as measures of

effectiveness.

Content and Format of Multi-program Objective State-

ments - Each multi-program objective will be documented

in the following order and format:

bo

Program Objective Statement - This is a one

sentence statement which clearly expresses the

program objective and must appear under each

ORGANIZATION OVERVIEW

the organization to take an overall look at the individual resource

requests and program plans presented in their submission.

are designed to assist the Department in integrating each organization':

FY 77 requests.

1.

Priority Rankings - There are three priority ranking require-

ments; each should be listed in descending order:

• Priority ranking of programs within the program

structure.

• Priority ranking of all program objectives.

• Priority ranking of all program increases.

It is essential that these rankings reflect the decisions

of each organization's senior management since these

rankings offer a quick summary for the Attorney General

of each organization's most important programs, objectives

and increases.

If the Department is again limited by

resource constraints in FY 77, these priority rankings

will become a critical factor

in the Department's resource

decisions.

In the Department's review of these rankings,

the important relationship will be the relative placement

of programs, objectives, and increases and not their

specific rank number.

over any program increase.

With continuing resource con-

highest priority program increases if it has absorbed as

much of its uncontrollable increase as possible through

the termination or curtailment of marginal program efforts.

Assessment of Alternative Funding Levels - This portion of the

pring Planning Call should be undertaken after all other

portions of the Call are complete. Regardless of the pro-

posed resource requirements requested by an organization for

Fy 77, this section requires each organization's senior manage-

to make two critical assessments:

Assume the organization receives a FY 77 dollar resource

allocation which is ten percent greater than its FY 76

Congressional Budget dollar level; how would such an

increase be accomplished and what would be the benefits

of such an increase?

Assume the organization receives a FY 77 dollar resource

allocation which is ten percent less than its FY 76 Con-

gressional Budget dollar level; how would such a reduc-

tion be accomplished and what would be the consequences

of such a reduction?

These two narrative responses should not exceed two single

spaced pages each.

They should also be consistent with the

three priority rankings in Section G.l. The narrative

assessments should be specific in terms of programs and

program objectives which would be affected.

Major Changes to Current FY 76 Congressional Budget -

Department management would like a concise, narrative dis-

cussion outlining major changes anticipated to the current

ry 16 operating plan represented by the ry 16 Congressional

Budget. The discussion should not exceed three single

spaced typewritten pages and should cover the following

topics:

Budget Amendments;

• Supplementals;

Major anticipated reprogramming or shifts in resources

rom current FY 76 Congressional Budget, including pro

osed inter organization transfers not yet surfaced:

• New programs not examined during FY 76 program review

process;

• Approved program objectives for FY 76 which will in all

likelihood be dropped;

New program objectives for FY 76 which were not

addressed during the FY 76 Department MBO/Budget

hearings.

Legislation changes affecting FY 76 programs not

yet presented to Department management.

Department of Justice

Program Activity Structure

The activity structure to be used by all Department of Justice organi-

zations in FY 77 will display program and budget data at a maximum of five

levels of detail. The nomenclature used for these levels is as follows:

I. Category

A. Sub-category

1. Area

a. Element

(1) Sub-element

The highest level of aggregation in this activity structure is the

category of which there are six proposed for FY 77. These categories were

designed to mesh with the functional categories used by OMB and the Congress.

The Departmental categories would be:

I. Enforcement of Federal Law and Investigations

Il. Enforcement of Federal Law Through Litigation

III. Federal Corrections and Rehabilitation

IV. State and Local Assistance

V. Department Program Direction

VI. Organization Program Direction

Most organizations will display their program and budget data under at

least two of the six categories. Where required, the activity structure

which follows has definitions of activities and the names of contributing

organizations which would report under a given level of activity.

DEFINITIONS OF ADJUSTMENTS TO BASE

mor be per to aye else the tiP on ere to on met on,

major equipment purchases, major systems development, etc. which have

been expended in the prior year. It should also be noted that FY 77

B. UNCONTROLLABLE INCREASES

The following are the only uncontrollable increases which will be

considered by the Department during the spring review:

To Annualization of Additional Positions Approved in FY 76 -

The amount authorized may not exceed the annual salary

rate and benefit cost for newly authorized positions less

the amount included for the compensation and benefits for

these positions in FY 76 Congressional action. In most

cases, some continuing lapse should be projected, e.g.,

4 percent.

2.

Within Grade Step Increases - An increase of 1% in

FY 77/FY 76 is acceptable for personnel compensation for

full-time permanent positions. This increase applies

only to GS employees and their equivalents.

3.

4.

Administrative Salary Increases - The successive annual

pay increases provided to United States Attorneys are

essentially the same as within grade step increases.

Because these increases apply to only one appropriation

and are not mandatory, they must be distinguished from

within grade increases and justified separately. This

justification should include a description of how the

estimate was calculated and how increases granted for

FY 75 for this item were expended.

Federal Telecommunication Services (FTS) - An estimate

should be submitted for the incremental costs of FTS

in FY 77 over FY 76.

When the Department receives the

bill for the actual FTS costs, these costs will be used

in lieu of the estimates.

C-7

HH 55299

## Page 65

6.

8.

10.

GSA Space Rental and Services - Only those adjustments

in SLUC charges that result from increases agreed to

with GSA and which support on-going existing programs

and personnel levels will be considered to be uncon-

trollable items.

Employee Accident Compensation - An estimate for employee

accident compensation in FY 7T should be included.

When

the Department receives the bill for the actual compensation

costs, these costs will be used in lieu of the estimates.

Increased Government Contribution to Law Enforcement

Retirement Fund - P.L. 93-350 provides that law enforce-

ment and firefighting personnel will be subject to

mandatory retirement at age 55 in 1978.

Beginning in

January 1975, the rate of the Government's share of

retirement contribution increased from 7% to 7 1/2%.

Appropriate bureaus and offices will determine the num-

ber and types of employees subject to the increased con-

tribution rates.

Consideration should be given to the

large volume of anticipated retirement actions due to

this legislation. Some areas of concern are: (a) back-

fill of positions; (b) grade structure; (c) recruitment,

training, and placement of new personnel; and (d) training,

placement, and relocation of promoted personnel.

Economies

due to retirement at senior grade, promotion from mid-level

grades, and hiring at lower grades are to be utilized to

defray additional costs to the maximum extent possible.

Wage Board Pay Increases for Employees - The estimate for

wage board salary increases should include increases in

salary rates that were not reflected in the latest Con-

gressional justification and anticipated salary. increases

for the current year.

Increased Retirement Contribution for Employees Under

Social Security Coverage - This allowance is intended to

provide for the annualization of certain increased costs

for employees earning FICA. For FY 77 calculations,

the compensation subjected to FICA has been increased

rom $12,600 to $14,100 and the rate applied againsi

hese earnings ceilings was raised from 4.85% to 5.85%

Printing and Reproduction Cost Increases - Contract

printing or other printing done under the control of the

Government Printing Office (GPO) of a recurring nature is

considered an uncontrollable cost. Since GPO determines

the disposition of most printing requests, increased costs

for printing services should be separately stated rather

C-2

HH 55299

DocId: 32989691 Page 65

## Page 66

than being included with estimated costs of wage board or

GS. salary

increases.

An increase of 10% may be used where

printing is a significant portion of the budget request.

Significant cost increases resulting from increased

printing workloads must be requested and justified as

program increases.

11:

Increased Government Contribution of Health Benefit Costs -

The Government's share of the cost for most health benefit

plans will grow in FY 77. This item was included in the

and wil be there to the tina 1 or

Only increases necessary to maintain ongoing programs

and staffing levels will be allowed.

C. INFLATIONARY RELATED COST INCREASES

For the fy 77 spring submission, organizations should identity items

which have been particularly sensitive to inflation.

The cost basts for

these estimates is the FY 75 column of the FY 76 Congressional Estimate.

The average FY 75 price level in effect shall be used to compute these

estimates.

All estimates must be supported with a copy of the calcula-

tions. The decision to consider these items in the FY 77 budget will

be made at a later date.

These estimates will allow the Department to

assess the impact of cost escalation on organizational resources.

Gasoline and Other Vehicle Fuel Costs - Although the

increased cost of gasoline is clearly recognized, it is

anticipated that economies in operation can compensate

for a portion of these costs.

The balance of these

increased costs should be identified.

2.

Utility Rate Increase - Some organizations are required

to pay for utility services; consequently, increased

costs resulting from utility service rate increases may

be justified as uncontrollable.

Increased costs that

result from increasing the units of consumption are not

considered as uncontrollable. This entry is restricted

to the Bureau of Prisons unless other organizations which

pay their own utility bills can justify such increases as

uncontrollable.

3.

Building Materials - The increased cost of building

materials has been dramatic and the shortage of basic

commodities assures continual cost escalation. Uncon-

trollable increases will be considered to maintain

C-3

## Page 67

existing facilities at the current level. This will

permit replacement of plumbing supplies, lumber,

wallboard,

etc.

Food - An accurate estimate for the increasing cost of

food is difficult to make, but there is strong evidence

that the upward cost trend will continue. Uncontrollable

increases will be considered for the salary and expense

accounts of the Bureau of Prisons and Immigration and

Naturalization Service.

SUMMARY PROGRAM NARRATIVE

In the fiscal year 1977, the FBI will continue to carry out its mandated

investigative responsibilities and provide essential services to the

criminal justice community. While these basic responsibilities are not

expected to change substantially, the FBI's approach to carrying out

these responsibilities will change in many instances when doing so will

have a favorable impact. In this regard, several FBI field divisions

have been engaged in a trial program whereby investigative emphasis

has been directed away from lower priority areas to criminal and

security matters having a greater overall impact on society. Consid-

eration is now being given to a field-wide application of this approach as

a matter of policy. This will not lessen the FBI's responsibilities but

it will result in less of an increase in the number of investigative matters

than would otherwise be expected.

There are several factors which will affect traditional workload indicators

or measures of accomplishments; however, we expect that the quality of

matters handled and the results obtained will be considerably improved.

One of those factors which will not necessarily decrease investigative effort

but will lessen the number of convictions obtained as the result of inves-

tigative activity is the Department's "Pretrial Diversion' program. Under

this plan, certain accused are diverted, generally before indictment, into

a structured rehabilitation program. If successful, charges are dropped.

The Speedy Trial Act of 1974 will also have an impact on FBI investigative

activities. This Act will ultimately require that over a four-year period,

beginning July 1, 1975, that an individual arrested or served with a

summons be indicted within 30 days, be arraigned within 10 days there-

after and brought to trial within 60 days following arraignment.

This restric-

tion on the prosecutive time allowed is certain to have an impact on the FBI's

investigations; however, it is too early to assess the extent of the impact.

Among the areas which will receive increased emphasis in the fiscal year

1977 will be white-collar crime and organized crime, each of which costs

the American public billions of dollars each year. Also, bank robberies,

which frequently result in injury or death to innocent people as well as

substantial monetary losses, are increasing at an alarming rate and will

receive substantial investigative attention. In order to increase the

effectiveness of FBI investigations, increased use will be made of the

highly successful undercover technique of investigation.

Notwithstanding any changes in emphasis of handling investigations of

criminal matters, the FBI must continue its concentrated efforts in the

counterintelligence and internal security areas to combat those organ-

izations or individuals who are intent on subverting our form of govern-

ment.

Not only does the FBI have a responsibility to investigate a myriad of

Federal crimes but it also has a most important obligation to provide

a variety of services to state, local and other Federal criminal justice

agencies so that those agencies can carry out their responsibilities for

the overall good of the American people. These service responsibilities

are steadily increasing and will require a substantial effort on the FBI's

part.

The amount requested for the fiscal year 1977 is $534, 092, 709, an

increase of $68, 325, 709, 14.67%, over the amount of $465, 767, 000 for

1976 which is presently pending in the Congress. The 1977 request will

provide for a staff of 21, 600 full-year employees (9,321 agents and

12, 279 clerks). This will be an increase of 2, 54% full-year employees

(821 agents and 1, 726 clerks) above the 19, 053 full-year employees to

be provided for in the 1976 fiscal year. In order to partially correct the

disproportionate ratio of field clerks to agents, an adjustment in esti-

mated agent man-years will be made to provide for 102 additional field

clerks in the 1976 fiscal year. Thus, the funds to be available for the

fiscal year 1976 will provide for 19, 053 full-year employees instead of

18, 951 as contained in the FBI's fiscal year 1976 request.

Following is a summary of the increase of $68, 325, 709, along with an

explanation of the items representing program increases.

Additional 2, 547 full-year employees

$36, 153, 882

Of the 2, 547 additional full-year employees requested, 954 (97 agents

and 857 clerks) are to restore personnel reduced in the fiscal year 1976

budget process because of the effects of a proposed rescission. A total

of 477 full-year employees (23 agents and 454 clerks) were cut as a

direct result of the rescission effects and another 477 full-year employees

(74 agents and 403 clerks) were lost as the result of a duplication of funds

cut because of the proposed rescission. It is essential that these

employees be restored if the FBI is to fulfill its investigative and service

12

HIH 55299

responsibilities. As an example of the critical need for these personnel,

the Identification Division, one of our major users of clerical personnel,

is already 400 people below authorized strength and will lose at least

100 more before the end of fiscal year 1975. These personnel cannot be

replaced because of the fiscal year 1976 cuts in personnel. As a result,

the Division is in a severe state of delinquency with no prospect for a let-

up in the foreseeable future. The response time to fingerprint receipts

has slipped from three days to five days and substantial overtime work is

now necessary to avoid a further delinquency. While the personnel

complement has been and will be reduced, the work of the Identification

Division has increased approximately 9. 5 percent during the first nine

months of fiscal year 1975. It is expected also that the Division's expunge-

ment workload will increase by 96 percent in the fiscal year 1975 and will

continue to grow because of recent court decisions regarding "detention

only" arrests. The State of California alone has indicated it will request

up to two million expungements over the next two years. There is also

substantially increased work because of the Division's support of the

Computerized Criminal History program and the necessity to operate a

dual fingerprint handling system in connection with the fingerprint auto-

mation effort.

An additional 638 full-year agents are to replace 1, 035 agents who are

subject to mandatory retirement as of January 1, 1978, under provision

of Public Law 93-350. It is essential that these agents be brought onto

the rolls and trained so that they will be productive by the time the

retiring agents are separated from the rolls early in the fiscal year

1978. While these additional agents are shown in the individual program

writeups as assigned to the field, they will be brought in and trained

throughout the fiscal year and will, therefore, add little to the investiga-

tive output during the fiscal year.

An additional 135 clerks are needed to correct an imbalance existing

in the field staff. The clerical staff in the field operations is well below

required levels. In order to provide adequate support for the agent

complement, a ratio of clerks to agents at the 61 percent level is re-

quired. These additional 135 clerks to achieve this ratio are exclusive

of 281 clerks which we are requesting be restored because of a reduc-

tion in the fiscal year 1975 due to the effects of a proposed rescission.

A total of 105 full-year employees (11 agents and 94 clerks) are neces-

sary to handle increased work brought about by the Freedom of Informa-

tion Act.

The remaining 715 full-year employees (75 agents and 640 clerks) are

needed to handle increased workloads throughout the FBI Headquarters

divisions.

Increase in costs for equipment

$6, 549,952

Approximately $3 million of the increase requested is for equipment to

be used in field office operations as follows: The amount of $273, 000

is for specialized weapons to be utilized in hijacking and hostage-type

situations.

Also, $111,000 is being requested to provide a total lighting

system which will provide light sources from minimal intensity to one

million candle power units with infrared and strobe capabilities. Pur-

chase of this equipment is needed to provide maximum safety for our

personnel. Presently, the Bureau does not have light systems with the

exception of two-cell flashlights and the mileray lamp. Special opera-

tions require specialized equipment to accomplish the operational

objective and to protect our personnel in a range of conditions from

subdued light to total darkness. An increase of $77, 000 is also requested

for the purchase of firearms and related equipment. The sum of $50, 000

is requested to begin a three-year program to provide concealable body

armor to our field offices. Presently our field offices have ceramic body

armor which is bulky and is worn on the outside of clothing. Approxi-

mately $1. 5 million of the increase is for additional voice communications

equipment, voice privacy systems, physical surveillance support systems

and various other technical equipment needed to support the FBI's investi-

gative functions. Also, an increase of $200, 000 is requested to provide

the funds needed for the New York Office to expand its photographic labora-

tory to provide a color processing capability to its current black and

white capability. An increase of $500, 000 is requested for crypto and

associated equipment. The amount of $150, 000 is needed for special com-

munications security equipment required for the New York Office due to

its impending move and reorganization. Also, an increase of $150, 000 1S

requested for emergency communications facilities to replace the CW

radio network which is being phased out.

Approximately $3. 5 million of the equipment increase is for headquarters

operations as follows: Approximately $1. 8 million is for specialized

laboratory equipment, including speech analysis and magnetic tape analysis

equipment, covert modulation equipment and various spectrographic and

analytical equipment. The amount of $1. 5 million is requested for an

automated document storage and retrieval system which is necessary to

efficiently handle the constant expansion of records. This system is

essential to the FBI's overall effort to automate its filing and record

processing functions. Also, $70,000 is requested for 70 additional cars

necessary for the Telelift system in the J. Edgar Hoover F. B.I. Building.

Additionally, $30,000 is also being requested for audio-visual equipment

needed for training of the large number of people in the Files and Com-

munications Division. An increase of $100, 000 is needed for printing

equipment.

Capital additions and increased equipment

and operational costs for the FBI Academy,

Quantico, Virginia

$4, 829, 480

Increased equipment costs comprise over $2. 2 million of this increase.

Funds are requested to purchase video tape viewing equipment, which

will be applied to each field office, so that video tapes that will assist

in training FBI personnel and state and local police can be prepared at

the Academy and supplied to the field offices. The necessary equip-

ment will cost $425, 000. An increase of $80, 000 is requested to buy

electronic targets for one of the three practical pistol course ranges at

the FBI Academy.

The moving targets will permit the implementation

of additional reaction courses which are vital in types of training

involving life and death situations. Also, under present conditions,

shooters spend one-third of their time scoring, pasting and refacing

targets. The installation of electronic targets will reduce this time sig-

nificantly, thus enabling the training of more students in the same

amount of time. Funds to purchase electronic targets for the other two

ranges will be requested in fiscal years 1978 and 1979.

An increase of $100, 000 is requested to purchase ear protectors which

are fitted with radio receivers. Under present conditions, shooters

wear ear protection to dampen the sound of gunfire; however, this

protection is considered inadequate. Further protection, including the

use of ear plugs with ear protectors, will reduce the noise. To afford

this protection, however, will make it almost impossible to hear in-

structions over the existing public address system. This could lead to

a dangerous situation. Ear protectors fitted with radio receivers will

allow instructions to be broadcast from the instructor's tower directly

to each shooter, eliminating confusion in instructions from range to

range.

The FBI has begun a program to provide specialized scientific aid and

training for police laboratory development. The amount of $1, 150, 880

is requested to purchase the specialized laboratory equipment needed

to provide this training.

The sole benefit of this equipment will be to

assist local and state police departments and their crime laboratories.

The FBI Laboratory is to begin specialized training at the FBI Academy,

including training related to gambling matters for the Accounting In-

Service and New Agents' training. The equipment needed to provide

"hands on" training, which is essential to successful investigative usage,

will cost $220, 000:

15

HH 55299

DooId: 32989691 Page 96

## Page 97

The increase also provides $1, 834, 000 for the addition of a fourth

floor to the classroom building at the FBI Academy to provide ade-

quate Laboratory training space and $235, 000 for equipment and

laboratory demonstration counters.

The increase provides $80, 000 to replace existing asphalt walkways

on the

pratical pistol course ranges with concrete and to replace

the grass areas with concrete between the seven-yard line and the

target line. Existing asphalt walkways must be resurfaced every three

to four years. This is costly and the ranges cannot be used while the

work is being done. Concrete should last indefinitely and provide more

secure footing.

The increase includes $100, 000 for renovation of the rifle range. This

includes replacing manually scored targets with an elecrically initiated

self-scoring type. These funds also provide for radiant heating units

to be installed in the ceiling over each shooting position.

Faculty development, publications and increased utilities costs make

up the remainder of the increase in costs.

Increase needed to fund an increased level

of transfers

$2, 472, 615

The needs of the FBI require that a large number of trasfers take place

each year. Developing crime trends in certain geographic areas, filling

vacancies left by retirements, promotions and need for specialized skills

all create a need for transfers to be made. Funds were provided in the

pending fiscal year 1976 request for approximately 1, 600 transfers,

using the rates experienced in the 1974 fiscal year. Funds for 2, 400

transfers have been requested for several years, that number being con-

sidered the necessary number to permit desired objectives to be

accomplished. The requested increase for fiscal year 1977 was computed

by applying the actual rates experienced in fiscal year 1974 to the increase

of 800 transfers requested.

Increase in rental of automatic data processing

equipment

$2, 239, 000

Exclusive of the rental of automatic data processing equipment for the

National Crime Information Center, Computerized Criminal History

program and the fingerprint automation effort, the increase in rental

of automatic data processing equipment for fiscal year 1977 will be

$2, 239, 000. These increased costs are necessary in connection with

payroll preparation and distribution, voucher processing, the uniform

crime reporting program, automatic data processing required for field

office specials, automation of the files and general index as well as

personnel and other administrative functions.

Funds needed to expand efforts in

investigative undercover operations

$1, 000, 000

The FBI has become increasingly engaged in undercover operations in

its investigative approach to organized crime and major theft matters.

This concept requires agent personnel to penetrate gambling rings or

establish small businesses for the purpose of exposing large shipments

of stolen property, bribe payments to public officials and Federal

wagering violations. Although the Bureau has been successful using

this technique, it has been severely restricted in its use because of a

lack of funds.

The FBI believes that undercover operations, often

involving the "store-front" approach, are a most effective weapon in

combating both organized crime and major theft rings and their use

should increase in the future. Therefore, an increase of $1, 000, 000

is requested to fund these operations.

Increased research and technical services

needs of the FBI Laboratory

$660, 500

This increase provides $40, 000 for research and development into

indented and obliterated writing; $150, 000 for research and develop-

ment regarding speech analysis and speaker identification; $285, 000 for

research and development for secure closed-circuit television trans-

missions; and $55, 000 for research and development into circuit minia-

turization. The remaining $130, 500 of the requested increase is needed

for iodination service, anti-sera and funds to attend technical seminars.

Increase in rental of space and equipment

$644, 214

An increase of $644, 214 is needed for the rental of special purpose

space and equipment, other than that related to automatic data processing,

at FBI Headquarters, in our foreign liaison offices and throughout our

59 field offices.

Increased costs for the National Crime

Information Center

$544, 000

The increase provides $230, 000 for the increased travel and per diem

expenses for meetings of the NCIC Advisory Policy Board, the Security

and Confidentiality Committee of the Board and meetings of partici-

pating agency representatives.

The increase also provides $167, 000

for increased communications lines costs and $147, 000 for increased

rental of automatic data processing equipment.

Costs for Terrorist Research and

Management Staff

$330, 000

The FBI is in the process of organizing a study-action team which will:

a) initiate and correlate research and data gathering relative to factors

involved in decision making during terrorist incidents; b) identify,

catalogue and consult with, on a contractual basis, outside experts of

the various disciplines concerning the dynamics of terrorism of interest

to law enforcement; c) travel on-site as needed to offer assistance to

FBI operational offices in dealing with terrorist negotiations; d) be avail-

able for consultation, without charge, at Quantico or on-site, to local

and state law enforcement agencies relative to terrorist incidents;

e) train Federal and local law enforcement personnel.

The estimated costs to proceed with this function, exclusive of salaries

of FBI personnel, are as follows: a) academic consultants, $80, 000;

b) per diem for FBI personnel, $40, 000; c) conferences, $60, 000; d) use

of personnel from other U. S. Government agencies, $50, 000; e) mis-

cellaneous expenses and computer time, $50, 000; and f) publications,

$50, 000. This program will be initiated in the 1976 fiscal year and funds

are being requested from LEAA to cover the costs, exclusive of the

salaries of FBI personnel, for the first year.

Communications line cost for the

Criminalistics Laboratory Informa-

tion System

$195, 120

The Criminalistics Laboratory Information System will be a nationwide

computerized laboratory information system. Forensic data will be

identified, collected and stored at a central location accessible to nation-

wide telecommunications lines. Although a final decision has not been

made as to where the data files will be housed, it is expected that the

FBI will be chosen because the NCIC is operational with a successful on-

line telecommunications network. It is expected the additional commu-

nications line cost will be $195, 120.

Refurbishing office and filing equipment

and other costs

$148, 210

This increase provides $100, 000 for refurbishing office and filing equip-

ment in the J. Edgar Hoover F. B.I. Building; $28, 210 to provide

language training for 32 clerical personnel to free an equal number of

agents for more complex investigative assignments; and $20, 000 for the

increased costs of Bureau publications.

designation for informant payments since FY 76? For each program

increase and uncontrollable increase items one and six in your sub-

mission detail the object classes affected and the programs affected

unless the increase is spread by manpower. Each increase should be

supported by an overall explanation of major items or services to be

for the same program. These increased funds will permit fiscal year

1977 activities at the same level as in fiscal year 1975. If this request

were to be disallowed, major curtailments in programs would have to

be effected in order to cut back to the fiscal year 1974 program level.

Item 6. Increase in payment to National Bureau of Standards for

nuclear reactor facilities

The amount of $20, 000 was placed in object class 25 - Other Services,

and thereafter distributed to the following program activities based on

estimated scientific examinations to be performed during the 1977

fiscal year.

I.A. 12. b.

Forensic Laboratories

60%

IV. A.3. d. (2)..

Forensic Laboratories

40%

Neutron activation analysis examinations are conducted for the most

part to determine whether an individual recently fired a firearm. A

paraffin cast of the web and forefinger of a suspect's hand is subjected

to a nuclear reactor and bombarded with neutrons to activate the ele-

ments antimony and barium, present in the primer of most cartridges.

Since the FBI does not have its own reactor capability, it must secure

this service from outside agencies through use of their reactors.

The increase in costs is occasioned by the increase in submissions of

this type by local police departments and crime laboratories which are

unable to conduct such a sophisticated examination. The increased

level of requested examinations is reflected by a comparison of the

July-April periods for fiscal years 1973, 1974 and 1975 as follows:

1973

1974

1975

1, 250

1, 610 (+29%)

2, 533 (+57%)

The fiscal year 1976 budget request contains $30, 000 for these exam-

inations. Due to the increased demand for this sophisticated type of

examination, a minimal increase of $20, 000 is requested and recent

experience indicates this amount may not be sufficient.

INCREASE FOR FBI PROGRAMS:

Item 1. Additional 2, 547 full-year employees

Exclusive of the personnel included in the program activity I. A. 2.a.,

Applicant Investigations - Reimbursable, the total increase of personnel

shown for all programs is 2, 649. This total does not give effect to an

adjustment in estimated agent man-years to provide for an additional 102

field clerks in the fiscal year 1976. The resultant mix by programs is

Too agents and 1, 884 Clerks. The total increase as shown by programs,

therefore, is 10% more than the 2, 547 additional employees requested.

which number gives effect to the adjustment to provide 102 additional

field clerks.

The program activities I. A. 12.c. and IV.A.3. e., Fingerprint Identifi-

cation, show a total increase of 738 employees for fiscal year 1977. This

increase is to compensate for the decrease in the fiscal year 1976 request

of 233 man-years which resulted from the effect of the 1975 proposed

rescission and realignment of program funds. The remaining 505 full-

year employees are for the ever-increasing workloads and the backlog

of work which is expected to continue to accumulate during fiscal year

1976.

The current pending fingerprint workload is approximately 80, 000

fingerprint cards and fingerprint work delinquency has reached 30, 000.

The Fingerprint Correspondence and Automation and Research Sections

are now relocated in the J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building and as predicted

the moves and subsequent settling in the new building have caused delays

in production and resultant increases in our delinquency. Between now

and the end of June, the larger file sections are scheduled to move to

the new Headquarters Building, which will continue to throw us behind.

Joviously with the increased workload of fingerprints to be processed

which are given priority, the FBI has found it necessary to let other

areas of work go which has caused serious backlogs in such areas as

fingerprint cards were on hand to be filed. At the same time the Card

Index Section had on hand to be filed more than 176, 000 index cards.

The backlog of disposition sheets has now reached 249, 000 and is growing

daily. With the tremendous current workload which has to be processed,

the records management programs such as purging, file checking, and

the like, are practically at a standstill because of the lack of personnel

to do this work. A prime example of this is the program to purge and

consolidate the civil fingerprint files. With the concurrence of the

Attorney General, the Defense Department, the Civil Service Commis -

sion, Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Archivist of the

19.4

HH 55299 DocId:32989691 Page 104

---

## Page 105

United States, the FBI established a long-term project to consolidate

and purge the civil file. Since 1970, personnel available for this work

has fluctuated depending on budget limitations and heavy work responsibili-

ties. The third phase of the original project, namely identification and

consolidation of duplicate fingerprint cards of individuals remaining in

file, keeping only one set of fingerprints and destroying all others on the

same person, has not yet been started.

The move to the J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building, along with the continued

growth of other Sections of the Identification Division, especially Automa-

tion and Research Section, require that premium floor space be conserved

in the most effective manner and that utilization of the fingerprint files

be made as efficient as possible. Completion of this most important

fingerprint consolidation project at the earliest possible date will greatly

enhance the realization of these goals. In order to obtain full benefits from

this project as soon as possible, the FBI requested an additional 150 full-

year clerks beginning with fiscal year 1975. The clerical employees

needed have not been made available; therefore, this most important project

has not been accomplished or even begun.

The fingerprint receipts through March 1975 show an increase of 242, 270

fingerprint cards or 9.46% over the same period last year. Receipts of

correspondence, forms and name checks for the first nine months of fiscal

year 1975 are running 9. 40% over the same period in fiscal year 1974.

An example of an unexpected increase in our workload, which necessitates

a considerable expenditure of manpower, is the receipt of approximately

70, 000 fingerprint cards of Vietnamese refugees. We are presently being

called upon to process these fingerprints along with the normal influx of

fingerprint. cards.

It is estimated that the expungement workload will increase by 96% in fiscal

year 1975 based on recent court decisions regarding "detention only" arrests,

as well as a notice from California that over the next 24-month period they

will request up to 2 million expungement records.

We are particularly concerned at this time about the FBI's automation time-

table which is being delayed as a result of the lack of personnel to train and

because backlogs are accruing by virtue of the fact that our data base has

now exceeded one million arrest records, some of which require updating.

So far we have continued to enter all "first offender" arrest records at the

rate of 3, 000 per day but a question arises as to the ability to continue to

do so and still update those records which have already been entered. At

present, there is a backlog of over 119, 000 dispositions (included in the

Division total of 249, 089) in the Automation and Research Section. Thus,

the FBI simply must take steps to post these dispositions to the existing

arrest records. The fact that the FBI is operating dual systems - automated

19.5

ITH

55299 DocId:32989691 Page 105

---

## Page 106

and manual - of necessity requires more personnel than operating a

single system. On July 1, 1974, we discontinued disseminating to non-

Federal applicant contributors arrest data over one year old unless

accompanied by a disposition. The FBI does not want to put itself in a

position of restricting dissemination because of its inability to process

disposition data that has been submitted.

In addition to the above, 'the Identification Division is presently having to

serve the Computerized Criminal History (CCH) program. The State

of Michigan is entering the CCH program which will require some 80, 000

computer printouts to be placed in the fingerprint files as flags.

The FBI must as soon as possible get more people on its rolls. In pro-

jecting attrition based on 1974 figures, the Identification Division expects

to lose an additional 100 employees between now and June 30, 1975.

It this situation occurs, there will be no alternative but to cut down and

possibly eliminate certain services and delay progress in the automation

of our manual system. This will be most unfortunate as the FBI is

committed to the expenditure of millions of dollars and presently has a

team of Rockwell International System Specialists on hand who are de-

signing its automated system in phases. If the FBI is unable to meet

the proposed timetable, it will result in an extension of its program

commitments which will result in additional expenditures of considerable

sums of money.

The proposed resource requests for object class 11, Personnel Compensa-

tion, and 12, Personnel Benefits, were allocated to the program activities

I. A. 12. c. Fingerprint Identification (Federal) and IV.A.3.e. Fingerprint

Identification based on the proportions of Federal and state and local

fingerprint receipts, correspondence, miscellaneous forms, name checks,

wanted notices and latent fingerprint cases received.

It is essential that in fiscal year 1977 there be a full restoration to the

Identification Division of clerical employees previously cut and additional

employees to accommodate the increasing service demands.

Category VI, except for VI. B.2. C.,

Systems Support, which will be addressed

elsewhère, consists of the' Director's Office, External Affairs Division,

Legal Counsel Division, Administrative Division, Office of Planning and

Evaluation and Inspection Division. These account for an increase of 20

agents and 103 clerks. The increased personnel are needed primarily

to respond to the ever-increasing level of requests for information from

the Department of Justice, the General Accounting Office, the General

Services Administration, the Civil Service Commission, various Congres-

sional Committees and FBI employees with respect to the 1974 Privacy

Act. Also, the centralized personnel function of the FBI is to be increased

19. 6

## Page 107

one agent and 31 clerks to supply support services for the additional

personnel requested for all other FBI programs.

The program

activity for VI. B. 2. b. (4)., Printing Services and Space Maintenance

shows an increase of one agent and 29 clerks. This increase, representing

19 percent, is generally consistent with the overall increase of those

programs it supports and is responsive to the level of requests for informa-

tion as indicated above. The costs for Personnel Compensation and

Personnel Benefits were spread to the program activities based on present

actual salaries.

Programs I. A. 12.a. and IV. A. 3.a. (2). deal with our training functions.

The costs were allocated between Federal training and state and local

training based on the field time devoted to each during fiscal year 1975

and by the estimated number and type of trainees at Quantico, Virginia,

during fiscal years 1976 and 1977. For fiscal year 1977, an

additional

120 full-year employees are requested which is consistent with the

increase expected in instructional hours afforded Federal, state and local

officers. Also, as detailed in our fiscal year 1977 submission, we

anticipate training about 1, 600 new agents during that fiscal year of which

approximately 1, 000 will be to replace those subject to mandatory

retirement under Public Law 93-350.

Maintenance of Investigative Records, program I.A. 12.g., shows an

increase of 161 full-year employees of which 105 (11 agents and 94 clerks)

are required for the handling of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.

While FOIA activity became heavy during fiscal year 1975, the costs of

staffing were not included in the FBI's budget request until fiscal year 1977.

An amendment to the fiscal year 1976 pending request has been requested

as these employees are now in place.

The additional 56 full-year employees

are to replace employees cut in the fiscal year 1976 request as explained

on pages 12 and 13 of our submission. The costs for this program activity

are in total those of the Files and Communications Division. It was there-

fore unnecessary to allocate the Division's costs to more than one program.

The costs for the additional full-year employees for those Headquarters

personnel who supervise field investigative activities, have been allocated

to the individual programs based on a survey of time spent on the respective

programs. The total additional full-year employees for fiscal year 1977

is 46 (17 agents and 29 clerks) who are necessary to handle increased work-

loads related to the supervision of field investigative activities and to handle

the spiraling increase in requests for data from other Government agencies

and Congressional Committees.

19.7

The category of Forensic Laboratories is split into those efforts for

Federal and state and local examinations conducted. On this basis, 47

additional full-year employees are requested in fiscal year 1977 for

program I. A. 12. b. and 32 for program IV. A.3. d. (2). Of the 79 full-

year employees, 17 are to replace personnel cut in fiscal year 1976

and 62 are necessary to handle the continuing increases in examinations

requested and the expanded program of training state and local crime

laboratory personnel.

Programs I.A. 12. d., Law Enforcement Information and Data Systems,

IV. A. 3. c. (2)., Law Enforcement Data Information Retrieval Systems,

IV. A. 3. C. (1)., Management and Statistical Data Assistance and VI. B. 2. c.,

Systems Support, represent the elements of the Computer Systems

Division. These account for a request for an additional 142 full-year

employees. The first 3 programs represent the NCIC/CCH and UCR

activities. The personnel costs for NCIC/CCH were allocated between

Federal and state and local based on the nature of the transactions

experienced. As UCR is dedicated to state and local criminal statistical

collecting, all costs for UCR remain in that program. The personnel

costs for NCIC/CCH, UCR and Systems Support were projected based

on the present organizational structure and future requirements.

additional personnel are required to service the increasing use of the

data systems of the FBI by other agencies and internally for investiga-

tive and administrative matters.

The total Headquarters increase for fiscal year 1977 is 1, 382 (86 agents

and 1, 296 clerks). This, added to the field personnel increase of 1, 267

full-year employees (679 agents and 588 clerks), totals the increase of

2, 649 full-year employees comprised of 765 agents and 1, 884 clerks.

The increase should be considered with the fact that an overall decrease

of 704 full-year employees (60 agents increase and 764 clerks decrease)

was experienced in fiscal year 1976 when compared with fiscal year 1975.

The net result is an increase from fiscal year 1975 to 1977 of 1, 945 full-

year employees (825 agents and 1, 120 clerks). The additional field

personnel as detailed above are needed to replace the 1, 035 agents subject

to mandatory retirement and to restore the clerical force to the proper

balance in support of the agent complement as set forth on page 13 of

our submission.

Item 2. Increase in costs for equipment

The increase in costs for equipment affects object class 31, Equipment.

It excludes increases in equipment costs for the Fingerprint Identification

programs and the Training programs, which increases are included in

"Decrease in funding of automation of fingerprint operation" and "capital

additions and increased equipment and operational costs for the FBI

Academy, Quantico, Virginia."

Approximately $3 million of the increase requested is for equipment to

be used in field office operations. This increase was spread to the

investigative programs based upon the proportionate amount of time spent

in each investigative program as reflected by the latest manpower utiliza-

tion survey. The specific items or class of items which make up this

increase are set forth under caption of "Explanation of Program Increase."

The remaining $3.5 million increase in equipment is for Headquarters

operations. Approximately $1. 8 million is for specialized laboratory

equipment, of which 60 percent was applied to program I. A. 12. b.,

Forensic Laboratories (FBl and Other Federal), and 40 percent to program

IV. A.3. d. 2)., Forensic Laboratories (state and local assistance). This

allocation was based on the number of scientific examinations conducted in

the two respective areas.

An increase of approximately $1. 6 million is requested for program

I.A. 12.g., Maintenance of Investigative Records. This increase will

provide for an automated document storage and retrieval system, 70

additional cars for the Telelift System in the J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building,

and audio-visual equipment needed for training the large number of people

in the Files and Communications Division. An increase of approximately

$100, 000 is requested for printing equipment. Increases relating to the

Administrative Division were allocated on personnel costs. Therefore, this

increase was applied to several General Services Support programs and

several Human Resources Services programs.

Item 3. Capital additions and increased equipment and operational

costs for the FBI Academy, Quantico, Virginia

This increase affects three object classes as follows: Rent, Communica-

tions and Utilities (23), $262, 900; Other Services (25), $2, 355, 700; and

Equipment (31), $2, 210, 880.

This increase was allocated to I. A. 12. a.,

Training (Federal), and to IV.A.3.a. (2), Training - General Law Enforce-

ment. For fiscal year 1977, the allocation between programs is 48 per-

cent and 52 percent respectively. The allocation is based on occupancy

rates at the FBI Academy.

19.9

HH 55299 DocId:32989691 Page 109

---

## Page 110

The $262, 900 increase is needed because of the increased utility costs

being experienced. In fiscal year 1974, when the 1976 fiscal year estimates

were prepared, the rate for electricity was $10 per 1, 000 kilowatt hours;

in tiscal year 1975 the rate increased to $22 and is presently, at the end of

fiscal year 1975, over $30 per 1, 000 kilowatt hours.

The $2, 355, 700 increase will provide over $2 million for the addition

of a fourth floor to the classroom building at the FBI Academy and for

equipment needed for the additional space. The additional classroom

space will provide for adequate Laboratory training space. Also, as set

forth in the section, "Explanation of Program Increases," $80, 000 is

requested to provide concrete walkways on the practical pistol course

ranges and $100, 000 is requested for renovation of the rifle range.

The requested s4, 210, 000 increase for equipment is also explained in

the section "Explanation of Program Increases." The increase will

provide funds to purchase video tape viewing equipment; electronic

targets for one of the three practical pistol ranges; ear protectors fitted

with radio receivers; and specialized laboratory equipment for training

purposes.

Item 4. Increase needed to fund an increased level of transfers

This amount was charged to the following object classes:

12 - Personnel Benefits

21 - Travel and Transportation

22 - Transportation of Things

Total increase needed

$

975,000

896, 800

600, 815

$2,

, 472, 615

The vast majority of these amounts were allocated to Category I -

"Enforcement of Federal Law and Investigations" and distributed to the

various program activities based on the proportion of effort actually

being expended in pursuit of the various investigative programs as

determined by a recent survey of all field offices and support services

actually being rendered.

A small portion of these amounts was allocated to Categories IV and

VI on the basis of the personnel dedicated to these program activities.

A large number of transfers must take place every year in order to

effectively fulfill our various investigative and service responsibilities.

Providing investigative support in response to changing crime trends,

filling vacancies left by retirements, promotions and the need for a

variety of specialized skills all create a need for transfers. Funds for

19.10

НН 55299 DooId:32989691 Page 110

---

## Page 111

approximately 1, 600 transfers were provided for in the fiscal year

1976 request.

Funds for 2, 400 transfers have been requested for

several years and this is considered the minimum number required

to efficiently meet our investigative and service objectives. In the

fiscal year 1977, funds for 2, 400 transfers are again being sought, an

increase of 800 over the amount provided for in the 1976 request. The

amounts were computed by applying the rates actually experienced in

fiscal year 1974 to the increase of 800 transfers requested.

A sustained level of transfers significantly lower than the 2, 400 target

level could seriously impair the FBI's capability to effectively address

its varied and changing responsibilities.

Item 5. Increase in rental of automatic data processing equipment

An increase of $2, 239, 000 is being requested for the rental of automatic

data processing equipment. This increase is in addition to that requested

and the National Came mation eton Centre cet ters ad tim out istory

change is 23, Rent, Communications and Utilities. The programs affected

and the amount of increase that applies to each program is as follows:

IV. A. 3. c. (1). - Management and Statistical

Data Assistance

$

30, 451

VI. B. 2.C. - Systems Support

$2, 208, 549

Allocation of the above figures was originally made based on personnel

costs incurred during the first nine months of fiscal year 1975 in the

Computer Systems Division. The increase for this Division was originally

subdivided into four program activities which were:

I.A. 12.d. - Law Enforcement Information and Data

Systems

IV. A. 3. c. (1). - Management and Statistical Data Assistance

IV. A.3. c. (2). - Law Enforcement Data Information Retrieval

Systems

VI. B. 2.c. - Systems Support

The above increases are required in implementation of the ongoing "in-house"

automotion projects and the ever-increasing workloads in other administra-

tive and investigative support functions.

19.11

IN 55299 DocId:32989691 Page 111

## Page 112

Item 6. Funds needed to expand efforts in investigative under-

cover operations

This amount was placed in object class 25 - Other Services and thereafter

spread to the various field investigative programs in Category I - Enforce-

ment of Federal Law and Investigations based on the proportion of effort

actually being expended in pursuit of these investigative programs as

determined by a recent survey of all field offices.

In recent years the FBI has become increasingly engaged in undercover

operations in its investigative approach to organized crime and major

theft matters. This imaginative approach has utilized agent personnel to

penetrate the underworld and to operate small businesses for the purposes

of exposing Federal wagering violations, large shipments of stolen property .

and bribe payments to public officials.

Notable successes have been accomplished in the use of this technique

although its application has been severely restricted because of a lack of

funds. The technique can involve large outlays of front money and operating

cash which is often not recoverable.

The most costly of these ventures

to date have been financed in conjunction with local and state law enforce-

ment agencies utilizing their own funds or grants from the Law Enforcement

Assistance Administration (LEAA). Cooperative ventures with state and

local law enforcement agencies are worthwhile and will continue to be

carried out where feasible. In past instances the great majority of funds

for these efforts have been supplied by the state and local participants

due to a critical shortage of available funding within the FBI. LEAA funds

are not available to the FBI for its use in this technique since Federal

law precludes the issuance of LEAA grants to other Federal agencies. If

the FBI is to continue to utilize this valuable investigative technique, and

to share a reasonably equitable portion of the costs, a financial resource

capability must be developed.

If sufficient funds are made available this highly productive investigative

approach could be used to combat other types of crime, such as white-collar

crime, which are on the upswing.

The limited experience which has been obtained in this technique clearly

shows its potential as a most effective weapon in combating certain types

of crime on a selective basis. Therefore, an increase of $1, 000, 000 is

needed at this time to fund such operations.

19.12

## Page 113

Item 7. Increased research and technical services needs of the

FBI Laboratory

This increase provides for the following costs, all included in object

class 25 - Other Services: $40, 000 for research and development

for indented and obliterated writing, which would be a new project in

fiscal year 1977; $150, 000 for research and development regarding speech

analysis and speaker identification which has received limited funding

in previous years; $285, 000 for research and development for secure closed-

circuit television transmissions and new miniature camera equipment

representing a new proposal; $55, 000 for research and development into

circuit miniaturization which has not been previously funded; $100, 500 for

initiation of iodination service and anti-sera which involves blood group-

ing for identification purposes; and $30, 000 for funds to attend technical

seminars.

These costs are included in program activities I. A. 12. b. and IV. A.3. d. (2).

Forensic Laboratories. Costs are allocated to these programs based on

estimated scientific examinations to be conducted by the FBI Laboratory

for both Federal and state and local agencies.

Item 8. Increase in rental of space and equipment

All of this increase is charged to object class 23 - Rent, Communications

and Utilities as it all represents equipment and space rental other than

through GSA. The major portion of this increase amounting to $565, 333

is for rental equipment such as duplicating machines, magnetic card

typewriters and specialized office equipment other than data processing.

Miscellaneous equipment where no purchase order is used accounts for

$7, 500. The remaining $71, 381 is composed of $64, 881 for annual space

rental other than from GSA such as remote radio relay installations and

for temporary space amounting to so, 500 for conterences and the like.

Substantially all of these costs are charged to the Laboratory, Files and

Communications and Training Divisions from which they were allocated

between Federal and state and local for program purposes on the same

bases as other object classes.

Item 9. Increased costs for the National Crime Information Center (NCIC)

The increase of $544, 000 for the NCIC falls into three general categories.

The object class for travel and per diem expenses is 21 - Travel and Trans -

portation of Persons and represents $230, 000 of the above amount. The

program activities affected by this increase are:

19.13

HH 55299

DocId: 32989691

Page 113

---

## Page 114

I. A. 12. d. - Law Enforcement Information and Data

Systems

IV. A. 3. c. (2). - Law Enforcement Data Information

Retrieval Systems

The allocation of these funds was based on the percentage of travel cost

of each Headquarters division which was in turn based on actual costs

for fiscalyear 1974.

The increase also provides $167, 000 for communications lines costs.

The object class for this increase is 23 - Rent, Communications and .

Utilities. An increase of $147, 000 is requested for the rental of automa-

tic data processing equipment.

This is also covered in object class 23.

The program activities for each of these increases is as stated above

for Travel and Transportation of Persons.

These increases are based on the increased use of the NCIC system.

Item 10. Costs for Terrorist Research and Management Staff

This increase will provide funding for a Terrorist Research and Manage-

ment Staff (TRAMS), a study action team, to do research on terrorism.

The costs, which are exclusive of salaries of FBI personnel, are dis-

tributed by object class as follows: (a) academic consultants, $80, 000,

(c) conferences, $60, 000, object class 25 - Other Services; (d) use of

personnel from other U. S. Government agencies, $50, 000, object class

25 - Other Services; (e) miscellaneous expenses and computer time,

siot sing a pe e) publications, $50, 000,

These costs are included in program activities I. A. 12.a. - Training and

IV. A. 3. a. (2). - Training - General Law Enforcement. The costs are

allocated to these programs based on estimated occupancy rates at the

FBI Academy fox Federal and state and local participants and actual field

experience during fiscal year 1975.

The FBI is in the process of organizing TRAMS which will be initiated

in the fiscal year 1976.

Funds are being requested from LEAA to cover

the costs, exclusive of the salaries of FBI personnel, for the first year.

19.14

H# 55299 DocId:32989691 Page 114

---

## Page 115

TRAMS is being organized to: a) initiate and correlate research and

data gathering relative to factors involved in decision making during

terrorist incidents; b) identify, catalogue and consult with, on a

contractual basis, outside experts of various disciplines concerning

the dynamics of terrorism of interest to law enforcement; c) travel

on-site as needed to offer assistance to FBI operational offices in

dealing with terrorist negotiations; d) be available for consultation, without

charge, at Quantico or on-site, to local and state law enforcement agencies

relative to terrorist incidents; and e) train Federal and local law enforce-

ment personnel.

Item 11. Communications line cost for Criminalistics Laboratory

Information System (CLIS)

The increase for this item is $195, 120. The object class covering this

increase is 23 - Rent, Communications and Utilities. The program

activity affected by this increase is IV. A. 3.c. (2). - Law Enforcement

Data Information Retrieval Systems. This increase is to cover communi-

cations line cost for the new system which will be in operation during

fiscal year 1977. The purpose of the system will be to collect, identify,

and store forensic data at a central location accessible to law enforce-

ment agencies throughout the Nation.

Item 12. Refurbishing office and filing equipment and other costs

This increase provides $100, 000 for refurbishing office and filing equip-

ment in the J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building in lieu of purchasing new

equipment.

It is included in object class 25 - Other Services. The costs

are included in program activity I. A. 12.g. - Maintenance of Investigative

Records and are based on estimates of actual cost.

The increase provides $28, 210 for foreign language training for 32

clerical personnel to tree an equal number or agents for more complex

investigative assignments. This is a new proposal for fiscal year 1977.

The costs are included in object class 25 - Other Services and are included

in program activity I. A. 12.a. - Training. The 32 positions are based

on a survey which indicated that of the Bureau's language requirements

of 101 positions, 32 could be handled by non-agent personnel. Costs are

allocated to the program based on training costs per student week provided

by the Defense Language Institute.

The increase provides $20, 000 for increased costs of Bureau Publications.

It is included in object class 24 - Printing and Reproduction and is included

in program activity VI. B. 2. b. (4). Printing Services and Space Maintenance.

CIVIL INVESTIGATIONS

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to provide the Department of Justice

(the Department) with investigative and accounting support in order to

protect the interest of the U.S. Government in connection with civil

matters in which the Government is a party of interest.

The planned impact of this program is to provide investigative support

for the defense of these cases and to insure that the Government pays

only its just debts. Conversely, in cases where the Government is the

plaintiff, this program will provide the investigative support to insure

that the Government receives full value for funds expended.

During fiscal year 1974, the FBI provided investigative support to

civil cases which when settled, resulted in a recovery and/or savings

to the Government of $179 million.

integrity, each Special Agent Accountant (SAA) receives periodic

training by our Certified Public Accountants and lecturers from the

private sector to provide them with the latest accounting and auditing

practices.

Because this program is responsive to the Department's specific

request and is not self generated within the FBI, no alternatives have

been considered.

There are no known risks or uncertainties which may affect the success

of this program.

The success of both the FBI and the Department's civil programs are

totally dependent on the interaction of both agencies. To foster this

coordination, SAAs attend seminars and lectures by various officials

of the Department relative to civil matters and U.S. Attorneys attend

similar sessions with FBI personnel.

There are no programs or activities within the programs which are

being terminated or curtailed and no new program initiatives are

planned for fiscal year 1977.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

The results of our investigative and accounting efforts are furnished

to the various Divisions of the Department which have cognizance over

civil matters and to virtually every U.S. Attorney. The direct client

served is the U.S. Government and indirectly the American taxpayer.

Program Justification:

This program is in support of the FBI's mission to conduct assigned

civil investigations at the specific request of the Department or U.S.

Attorneys.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

There are no known legislative matters pending which would affect the

program and no changes to existing legislation required.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

The most recent formal evaluation of the FBI's civil investigation was

conducted by the fBI's Inspection Division, the results of which are

contained in that Division's report dated 2/24/75, to the Associate

Director. Additionally, the effectiveness and impact of the program

has been followed and reported to the Department in bimonthly progress

reports for Management by Objective, program objective No. 1. The

latest report was dated 5/7/75.

I. A. 2. a. APPLICANT INVESTIGATIONS - REIMBURSABLE

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to render assistance to other Federal

agencies by conducting applicant-type investigations concerning indi-

viduals under consideration for sensitive and high-level appointments.

There is no direct impact on public problems through this program.

However, indirect effects may be reflected in areas such as public

confidence in Government through the knowledge that persons who

occupy important and sensitive positions are afforded an investigation

designed to discover those individuals whose employment would not be

in the public interest.

During the first eight months of fiscal year 1975, 1, 945 reimbursable

applicant-type cases have been referred to the FBI for investigation.

Procedures have been established to insure that a comprehensive

background investigation is conducted on each applicant. Close scru-

tiny is afforded each investigation to insure that it is thorough and

complete.

Since this program exists to examine each applicant's suitability for

Government employment,

there is no viable alternative to a full

inquiry into his background.

At the present time, the issue of privacy and the requirements of the

Freedom of Information Act raise uncertainties as to the future of this

program. More restrictive legislation could limit the amount of

information which could be developed and reported and, if access to

investigative results is granted to subjects of investigation, less can-

did information may be provided and some sources could discontinue

cooperation completely.

These investigations are conducted at the request of other agencies

and the results are forwarded to them. Liaison is maintained with

these agencies and every effort is made to maintain an even flow of

investigative requests to assure that this program will effectively and

efficiently fulfill its purpose as well as to provide more expedite

processing when necessary.

No termination or curtailment of this program is anticipated and no

new program initiatives are contemplated for fiscal year 1977.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

Outputs in this program consist of completed applicant background

investigations, the results of which are forwarded to the requesting

agencies. Principal sources of these cases include the Energy

Research and Development Administration, Nuclear Regulatory Com-

mission, Administrative Office of the United States Courts, and the

Department of State, as well as other Federal agencies.

Program Justification:

These investigations are conducted pursuant to statutory requirements

such as the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, Executive Order, and author-

ization of the Attorney General.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

No legislative changes which would increase the probability of program

success are anticipated. However, there are currently pending in

Congress a number of privacy bills (such as House Resolution 550,

dealing with access to bank records) which, if enacted, could adversely

affect FBI investigations in this field.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

A bimonthly progress report was submitted on May 7, 1975, evaluating

he progress to date in fiscal year 1975 of Program Objective Numbe

13 (Applicant Investigations).

These investigations are also regularls

reviewed during the course of FBI field office and Headquarters inspec-

tions.

I. A. 2. b. APPLICANT INVESTIGATIONS - NON-REIMBURSABLE

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to render assistance to other Federal

agencies and certain congressional committees by conducting

applicant-type investigations concerning individuals under consider-

ation for sensitive and high-level appointments. This program also

services the FBI's own needs with respect to employment.

There is no direct impact on public problems through this program.

However, indirect effects may be reflected in areas such as public

confidence in Government through the knowledge that persons who

occupy important and sensitive positions are afforded an investi-

gation designed to discover those individuals whose employment

would not be in the public interest.

In addition to those investigations concerning FBI employment,

2,506 non-reimbursable applicant-type cases have been referred to

the FBI for investigation during the first eight months of fiscal year

1975. The most extensive special inquiry ever conducted was

completed during this period - the investigation of Vice President

Nelson A. Rockefeller which commenced on August 20, 1974, and

ran practically continuously until his confirmation on December 19,

1974. Further, since February 11, 1975, the FBI has received on

an expedite basis 68 investigations for the Senate Select Committee

on Intelligence Activities.

Procedures have been established to insure that a comprehensive

background investigation is conducted on each applicant as appropriate.

Close scrutiny is afforded each investigation to insure it is thorough

and complete.

Since this program exists to examine the suitability for Government

employment of each person for whom an FBI applicant-type investi-

gation is requested or warranted, there is no viable alternative to

a full inquiry into his background.

At the present time, the issue of privacy and the requirements of

the Freedom of Information Act raise uncertainties as to the future

of this program. More restrictive legislation could limit the

amount of information which could be developed and reported and, if

access to investigative results is granted to subjects of investigation,

less candid information may be provided and some sources could

34

H# 55299 DocId:32989691 Page 130

---

## Page 131

discontinue cooperation completely. Concerning the FBI's internal

needs, the risks and uncertainties are the availability of candidates

to meet the general and specialized requirements of this Bureau.

For those investigations which are conducted at the request of other

agencies, the results are forwarded to them. Liaison is maintained

with these agencies and every effort is made to maintain an even

flow of investigative requests to assure that this program will

effectively and efficiently fulfill its purpose as well as to provide

more expedite processing when necessary. The portion of this

program which addresses the internal needs of the FBI requires no

coordination with other Department organizations or other govern-

ment agencies.

No termination or curtailment of this program is anticipated. As

noted in "I. A. 12. a. TRAINING"', about 1, 600 new agents are to be

trained during fiscal year 197%, which will cause increased activity

in this program. Also, additional applicant-type investigations for

clerical employees will be required.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

Outputs in this program consist of completed applicant background

investigations, the results of which are forwarded to the requesting

agencies, or evaluated internally for employment purposes. Princi-

pal sources of these cases include The White House, Department of

Justice, National Security Council, Civil Service Commission,

several congressional committees and the FBI itself.

Program Justification:

Investigations for other agencies are conducted pursuant to Executive

Order, public laws, Departmental Order 175-59, authorization of

the Attorney General, and agreement with The White House. Chapter

33, Title 28, U.S. Code. 28 CFR 0. 137 authorizes the Director of

the FBI to exercise the power and authority vested in the Attorney

General to take final action in matters pertaining to employment

with certain exceptions.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

No legislative changes which would increase the probability of program

success are anticipated. There are currently, however, pending in

Congress a number of privacy bills (such as House Resolution 550,

dealing with access to bank records) which, if enacted, could directly

affect FBI investigations in this program.

I. A. 3. ORGANIZED CRIME

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to reduce the impact of organized

crime on the American public through a sustained effort aimed at edu-

cating the general public; training local, state, and Federal officers;

and developing investigations with the highest potential for cutting off

hoodlum funds, breaking up major underworld syndicates, and success-

fully prosecuting top racket figures.

It is anticipated that investigative efforts in the field of organized

crime will impact on public problem areas by reducing the amount of

economic resources being lost to the gambling element; by promoting

the safety and welfare of individual citizens through the prosecution

of vicious loan sharks, labor racketeers, and the like; and, indirectly,

by reducing the incidence of spin-off crimes (such as burglaries,

robberies, muggings, and shopliftings) being committed by gamblers

and other organized crime victims seeking to support their illicit

habits.

By way of program impacts to date, FBI investigations of organized

criminal groups during the past ten years have resulted in approxi-

mately 6, 200 convictions and the confiscation of cash, property,

weapons, and wagering paraphernalia valued at more than $17 million.

In addition, there are currently some 1, 900 other organized crime

subjects in various stages of prosecution in FBI cases. Among those

arrested, indicted, or convicted during that period were the heads of

criminal syndicate operations in New York City, New Jersey, New

England, Philadelphia, Buffalo, northern Pennsylvania, Chicago,

St. Louis, Kansas City, New Orleans, and Los Angeles. Other major

accomplishments include several major bookmakers who allege that

FBI efforts have driven them out of business; three ranking hoodlum

figures who fled the country but were ultimately deported back to the

United States when FBI investigations established their whereabouts

(Joe Bonanno from Canada, Meyer Lansky from Israel, and Sam

Giancana from Mexico); and the disruptive influence of revolts by

younger mobs--such as the Black Mafia --which feel that Federal

prosecutive efforts have substantially weakened the older, more

experienced gangs.

Primarily the FBI has geared itself to the "target" approach in its

fight against organized crime. This means that, through informants

and other investigative techniques, key underworld figures are being

39

HN 55299 Do0Id:32989691 Page 135

---

## Page 136

identified, their chains of command determined, and their sources of

illicit revenue being pinpointed so that investigative personnel can

most effectively be concentrated on these major operations.

As part of this "target" approach, the FBI carefully considered the

advisability of instituting an alternate procedure somewhat similar to

the Drug Enforcement Administration's GDEP (Geo-Drug Enforce-

ment Program), which establishes a geographical and priority system

of selectivity in enforcing Federal narcotics laws. It was felt, how-

ever--partly because the FBI has more than 150 wide-ranging statutes

to enforce, compared with DEA's more restrictive responsibilities in

the drug field, and partly because small organized crime cases often

lead to bigger ones --that the FBI should not attempt to be selective in

the sense that it would ignore certain minor violations in order to get

at the bigger ones. Under the 'target" concept, primary investigative

efforts are directed at key operators, but no violations are knowingly

passed over simply because of size.

The 'target" approach was selected after more than ten years' exper-

ience enforcing the Federal gambling laws passed in 1961 and showed

that convictions of major operators and the breaking up of their wide-

spread rings had a greater effect on the underworld than did the broader,

less concentrated forms of investigative activities. At the same time,

however, this system does not ignore lesser offenses which come to

the Bureau's attention during the course of its organized crime investi-

gations. It simply places a higher priority on the more important

cases.

No program alternatives have been considered.

Although there is a slight risk that Agents concentrating on "target"

cases may overlook an equally important--but less well known--opera-

tion elsewhere, it is felt that good informant coverage of the under-

world will reduce this likelihood to an absolute minimum.

As regards uncertainties, the largest is the difficulty encountered over

the years in assessing actual results in organized crime cases. Is the

conviction of a Syndicate leader in a small midwestern state the same

as a similar leader in New York City? Since the President's Com-

mission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice reported in

1967 that there "is no accurate way of ascertaining organized crime's

gross revenue from gambling in the United States, " how can a scale

be drawn up to determine whether such revenue is rising or declining

at any given time? Although the disruptive consequences of prosecu-

40

55299 DooId:32989691 Page 136

---

## Page 137

tions, informant penetrations, abdications by leaders, and rival

incursions resulting from power vacuums are known to be seriously

handicapping major racket operations at the present time, it is diffi-

cult to evaluate this disruption and its advantages to the country as a

whole.

Where a given city has a Federal Strike Force, the local FBI office

works closely with this Strike Force in applying the "target" concept

to its organized crime investigations. Where there is no Strike Force,

the coordination is conducted through the United States Attorney's

office. Extensive liaison is also maintained with the Drug Enforce-

ment Administration; the Internal Revenue Service; the Bureau of

Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; the United States Secret Service;

and other Federal investigative agencies having responsbilities in the

field of organized crime.

There are no activities in the FBI's organized crime program which

are being terminated or curtailed, nor does the FBI have any new

organized crime program initiatives planned for fiscal year 1977.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

The principal outputs under the FBI's organized crime program

results in prosecutive action against hoodlum, gambling, and vice

figures, the training in organized crime matters of police executives

and officers attending the FBI National Academy, and the education of

the general public regarding the organized crime menace through

articles, speeches, and press releases. There are no clients, as

such, served directly under this program.

Program Justification:

FBI investigations of organized crime operations are carried out

under a series of statutes aimed primarily at large-scale gambling,

hoodlum loan-sharking, extortion, labor-racketeering, prostitution,

certain forms of bribery, and criminal infiltration of legitimate indus-

try.

In addition, at least two Presidents (Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M.

Nixon) and the 1967 President's Commission on Law Enforcement and

Administration of Justice have stressed the need for a major Federal

effort directed against the forces of organized crime.

## Page 138

Legislation Affecting the Program:

There are currently no changes planned to existing legislation or pro-

posals for new legislation which would increase the probability of suc-

cess in the organized crime program. There are currently pending

in Congress a number of privacy bills (such as House Resolution 550,

dealing with access to bank records) which, if enacted, could directly

inhibit FBI investigation in the field of Organized Crime.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

On May 7, 1975, a bimonthly progress report was submitted by the

FBI evaluating the effectiveness to date in fiscal year 1975 of Program

Objective No. 2 (Organized Crime). In addition, the Bureau's inspec-

tion staff regularly examines and evaluates the organized crime pro-

gram, both at FBI Headquarters in Washington and in each of the 59

field offices.

I. A. 4. WHITE-COLLAR CRIME

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to curtail White-Collar Crime (WCC)

involving the fraud, embezzlement, bribery, and conflict of interest

by individuals clothed in an air of respectability in Government, labor,

and business.

WCC is estimated to have cost the public over $40 billion annually.

The increased emphasis on WCC has resulted in an increase of 14 per

cent in the convictions in this category during fiscal year 1974 and it

is expected that the program will have a greater impact during fiscal

year 1977.

A four-phased program of research, training, intensified investigation,

and increased public awareness has been developed in order to attain

the program's stated goals.

No viable alternative programs appear to exist.

There are no known risks or uncertainties which may affect the success

of the program.

This program will interface with the Department of Justice's WCC

program in providing research and training seminars to the various

U.S. Attorneys as well as intensified investigative support for the

prosecution of these crimes.

There are no programs or activities within the programs which are

being terminated or curtailed and there are no new program initiatives

planned for fiscal year 1977.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

Investigative reports are made available to the Department and U.S.

Attorneys to support various WCC prosecutions. U.S. Attorneys and

Departmental Attorneys participate in the Bureau's WCC seminars on a

regional basis as well as at the FBI Academy, Quantico, Virginia.

Program Justification:

to combat the staggering loss due to WCC, the Department as well as

the Director of the FBI have designated WCC as an area targeted for

intensified investigation and prosecution on a nationwide basis through-

out the coming decade. Violations are investigated under existing

statutes.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

There are no known pieces of existing or proposed legislation which

would increase the probability of the program's success. However,

there are several pieces of pending legislation dealing with the confi-

dentiality of bank records, for example, House Bill No. HR 1005,

which, if passed, would effectively strangle the FBI's investigation of

WCC in the Bank Fraud and Embezzlement areas.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

as conducted the let see liston, the suits or grace

are contained in that Division's report dated 2/24/75, to the Associate

Director. Additionally, the effectiveness and impact of this program

has been continually monitored in bimonthly progress reports submitted

to the Department in the Management by Objective program. The last

report submitted was dated 5/7/75.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE

Program Objective:

To provide investigative support to the Department in combating White-

Collar Crime (WCC).

Accountable Program Manager:

Program Objective Resource Requirements:

Man-Years -

Total Dollars (in thousands) -

1,974

$50, 675

Program Objective Description:

A two-phased program of training and intensified investigation has been

developed in order to attain program's stated goals. In order to insure

that there is a clear understanding between the FBI investigator and

the Departmental prosecutor, seminars on both a regional and national

level are being developed to acquaint the various U. S. Attorneys with

accounting documentation and theories necessary to substantiate WCC

prosecutions. Concurrently, with this action, the FBI is revising its

report writing procedures to more clearly portray to the prosecutor

the results of the investigation contained therein. Because of the ever-

increasing complexity of the schemes utilized by the WCC criminal,

including the use of computers to perfect his crimes, the FBI has

embarked in a specialized training program for each of its accountants.

These training lectures conducted by our certified public accountants

insure that each accountant agent is cognizant of the latest accounting

practices and theories relative to the investigation of WCC.

Additionally, regional conferences with representatives of the States

Attorneys General offices will be held so that WCC may be attacked

from a state and Federal level simultaneously.

Certain fraud and embezzlement categories are being targeted for

intensified investigation and a nationwide public awareness program

has been established in order to encourage the reporting of WCC

activities. It is expected that these coordinated approaches will have

a significant impact on the incidence of WCC. Since it is almost

49

HH 55299

DocId: 32989691

Page 145

---

## Page 146

impossible to measure the exact impact of the program, statis-

tical information relative to the number of cases investigated by

the FBI will be monitored in an effort to determine the impact of

the program.

Key Milestones:

August 1976 - Initiation of regional conferences with representatives

of the States Attorneys General relative to the combating of WCC.

December 1976 - Evaluate the specialized computer course being

afforded senior special agent accountants, as it affects the FBI's

investigation of bank fraud and embezzlement matters.

Evaluate the results of the program objective through the monitoring

of statistical data.

March 1977 - Review the increased public awareness program to

determine its effectiveness in encouraging the reporting of WCC.

GENERAL CRIME - INTERSTATE

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to supplement investigative efforts of

local and state law enforcement which are inhibited by state and other

political subdivisions in pursuit of criminal offenders crossing state

lines.

In fiscal year 1974, investigation in this area resulted in 4, 704 con-

victions in which subjects received actual sentences in excess of 8, 304

years, but not including suspended and probationary sentences. Fines

in the amount of $1, 018, 581 and savings of $8, 180, 492 were recorded,

as well as recovery of $99, 584, 838. During these investigations,

3, 175 fugitives were located.

1977 is anticipated expressed in terms of the above statistics.

The program will continue through liaison, investigation and careful

supervision to be implemented. An alternate program to Federal

involvement is not considered feasible since only the Federal Govern-

ment may effectively work across the myriad of political subdivisions

and respective law enforcement agencies to combat interstate crime.

There are no known risks or uncertainties which may affect previous

success of this program.

Coordination is required between the Bureau and the United States

Attorneys' Offices for successful prosecution. No programs or activi-

ties are being terminated or curtailed. The same program initiatives

will be pursued in fiscal year 1977 unless new legislation should pre-

clude it.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

The major outputs of this program involve criminal investigation to

identify perpetrators of crimes against property, as well as the recovery

of the property and arrest of those responsible. To a lesser amount

though, no less in importance is the removal from society of persons

who commit crimes against persons, i.e., Kidnaping, White Slave

Traffic Act and Interstate Obscene or Harassing Telephone Calls.

The general populace, as well as the transportation industry, are

served by investigations of interstate crimes.

Program Justification:

Justification for these investigations is to be found in the various

titles and sections of the U.S. Code which designate investigative

jurisdiction to the FBI.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE

I. A. 5. a. INTERSTATE CRIME

Program Objective:

To reduce investigative activity in areas of concurrent jurisdiction

with local-state authorities through Federal-State Law Enforcement

Committees.

Accountable Program Manager:

Robert E. Gebhardt, Assistant Director

Program Objective Resource Requirements:

Man-Years -

Total Dollars (in thousands) -

Program Objective Description:

This objective is designed to lessen investigative activity concerning

minor cases and to permit greater concentration of efforts on more

complex, farther reaching interstate crime. Active participation in

conferences involving state and district attorneys, U. S. Attorneys

and Federal and state law enforcement agencies to clarity areas of

responsibility and insure that cooperation maximizing effective law

enforcement reaction will continue. Active liaison with the Depart-

ment concerning this objective has been and will continue to be

maintained.

A measure of effectiveness will be the conviction rates for interstate

crime as related to the more serious type offenders. This should

determine the impact of the Federal-State Law Enforcement Committees

whose objective is to reduce investigative activity in minor cases in

areas of concurrent jurisdiction.

Key Milestones:

October 1976 and quarterly thereafter - Will evaluate the impact

on FBI investigative activity in areas of concurrent jurisdiction brought

about through liaison and participation in Federal-state Law Enforce-

ment Committees.

I. A. 5. b. CRIMES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT

Program Description:

The bulk of the FBI's work in the area of Crimes Against the Government

(exclusive of Fraud Against the Government and Crimes on Govern-

ment Reservations which are covered elsewhere) consists of violations

of the following statutes: (1) Theft, Embezzlement, Robbery, Illegal

Possession of, or Destruction of Government Property; (2) Assaulting

or Killing a Federal Officer; (3) Impersonation (of Federal officials

or employees); (4) Illegal Wearing of the (military) Uniform; and

(5) Irregularities in Federal Penal Institutions.

The purpose of this program is to insure prompt FBI response to all

violations of pertinent statutes. Also, to insure that our Agents are

qualified to conduct the very best investigations possible in order that

perpetrators are swittly identified, arrested, and prosecuted. The

training of Agents to accomplish these goals is paramount. Close

supervision of investigations by field and Headquarters personnel is

considered essential.

As in the past, the FBI will, in fiscal year 1977 put forth every effort

to achieve the above goals.

This should result in decreases in losses

of public property, declines in injuries and deaths inflicted upon Fed-

eral personnel, etc. Program plans will therefore be achieved.

There are no apparent alternatives whereby program goals may be

reached.

For the five investigative classifications involved in this program in

fiscal year 1973, there was a total of 1, 026 convictions.

This figure

for fiscal year 1974 was 1, 200 and in the first nine months of fiscal

year 1975, there was a total of 1, 175 convictions. These statistics

illustrate that this program is producing a steadily increasing number

of statistical accomplishments.

There are no apparent risks or uncertainties to this program.

In conducting this program there is continued, substantial coordination

with other government agencies. For example, in investigating Thefts

of Government Property, the FBI frequently works closely with other

investigative agencies such as the Naval Investigative Service, the

Office of Special Investigations (United States Air Force), and the

Criminal Investigations Division (United States Army). In investigating

violations of the Impersonation or Illegal Wearing of the Uniform

Statutes, close liaison with the appropriate civilian governmental or

appropriate military agency is maintained.

56

HН 55299 DocId:32989691 Page 152

---

## Page 153

There are no programs or initiatives within the Crimes Against the

Government program which are being terminated or curtailed and

there are no new initiatives planned for fiscal year 1977.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

The major outputs of this program consist of the solution of the various

violations; apprehension and conviction of the perpetrators; and the

recovery of property involved. Clients served may be inferred from

a reading of statutes such as those listed under Program Description,

They include the many government agencies which suffer losses

by theit, embezzlement, etc.; Federal Government employees who

may be exposed to assault; the various military agencies involved;

et al.

Program Justification:

This program is justified by the various Titles and Sections of the

United States Code which rest investigative jurisdiction upon the FBI.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

At present, there are no changes in legislation pending which would

affect the workings of this program.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

Activities under this program are regularly scrutinized and evaluated

by the Inspection Division of the FBI. The purpose is to insure that

the program is operating with maximum effectiveness.

I. А. 5. c. FORCIBLE CRIMES AGAINST BANKING INSTITUTIONS

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to institute immediate investigations of

violations of the Federal Bank Robbery and Incidental Crimes Statute as

they occur with the objective of identifying subjects and developing evi-

dence for prosecution of those subjects in Federal court. This is fos-

tered by training FBI Agents to investigate violations of this Statute,

supervision of the Agent's activities, and continuous evaluation of the

results of our investigations.

During fiscal year 1977 it is anticipated that this program will impact

on possible problems stemming from crimes of violence associated

with Bank Robberies, Burglaries, and Larcenies, a loss of money

from financial institutions and other property and the removal of the

perpetrators of these crimes from the streets. In fiscal year 1974

there were more Federal convictions recorded of individuals prose-

cuted for forcible crimes against banking institutions than in the pre-

vious year.

Program Impacts to Date:

Program plans will be achieved by our continued immediate response to

to violations of this classification as they occur. There are no viable

alternatives available which accomplish the desired ends of this

program.

The risks and uncertainties which may affect the success of this pro-

gram depend upon the early identification of subjects along with the

accumulation of sufficient evidence on which to base successful prose-

cution of those subjects in Federal courts.

Continual coordination is effected with local police and other appropri-

ate agencies to assure program success. There are no activities

within the FBI's program which are being terminated or curtailed nor

does the FBI have any new initiatives in this field for fiscal year 1977.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

The major outputs of this program involve the solution of violations of

this investigative classification, conviction in Federal court of the

perpetrators and the recovery of loot whenever possible.

The banking industry may be observed as the direct client served by

this program, however, the U.S. Government as the insurer of many

of these institutions and the public at large are also served.

60

HN 55299

DocId:32989691 Page 156

## Page 157

Major Justification:

The fundamental authority for the investigation of the above activities

by the FBI is located in Section 2113 of Title 18, U.S. Code.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

There are currently no known changes being considered to existing

legislation or proposals for new legislation which would increase the

probability of success in the Forcible Crimes Against Banking Institu-

tions Program.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

This program is regularly examined and evaluated by the Bureau's

inspection staff to insure that it is operating with optimum effective-

ness.

I. A. 5. d. GENERAL CRIME - OTHER CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS

Program Description:

The program's purpose is to promptly solve violations of the Federal

law within this program, to gather and carefully preserve evidence ob-

tained during each investigation and ultimately the prosecution of the

perpetrators.

The planned fiscal year 1977 impact on the national crime problem

posed by violations of these laws is the significant reduction of the

volume and scope of these offenses and the judicial handling of each

violator. This impact on this particular public problem will serve to

act as a shield for victims, both individuals and organizations, of

these Federal crimes and convictions of crime perpetrators in U.S.

District Courts also register program impacts.

Program plans are achieved by setting as work product objectives the

successful early solution of violations, the proper collection of sub-

stantive evidence, both as to guilt and innocence, and the professional

preservation and presentation to duly constituted officials of such

evidence.

No program alternatives have been considered.

No curtailment of present programs is planned and no new program

activities are anticipated.

At the differing stages of each investigation, a certain amount of coor-

dination and joint planning with other departments or organizations is

required. Risks and uncertainties exist only so far as our ability to

solve cases, arrest perpetrators and secure convictions through

weight of evidence.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

Outputs are measured by the solution of violations and the rates of

conviction of violators. This, however, must be constantly followed

and evaluated, both from a qualitative as well as quantitative stand-

point, inasmuch as the seriousness and magnitude of violations can

differ markedly. Clients served, as they relate to FBI activities and

operations, are both individual and organizational victims.

Program Justification:

The justification for FBI operations and activities is specifically set

out in statute law, investigative jurisdiction of which has been specif-

ically assigned to the FBI. Additional justification is found in execu-

tive orders, Department of Justice orders, and the FBI's definite

responsibility to closely cooperate with legitimate law enforcement

officials at other levels of government.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

There are no known legislative changes at present that will affect this

program.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

A review of the work product is regularly evaluated by the FBI Inspec-

tion Division.

I. A. 6. CIVIL RIGHTS

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to continue to improve the potential

for citizens to obtain and maintain their Civil Rights as a result of

our Civil Rights investigations supported by a continuous program

of instruction in these matters during FBI training courses,

regional conferences as required, and during training sessions

afforded other law enforcement personnel.

This program should continue to have a favorable impact in fiscal

year 1977 on public interests, such as discrimination in housing,

employment, public education, public facilities, and public accom-

modations, as well as in voting and areas relating to due process

and equal protection of the laws of the United States.

This program is in support of our investigative activities in the

field of Civil Rights which has had dramatic impact and to a great

extent has substantially altered the social, educational and govern-

mental fabric as it previously existed in this country.

The program has been and will continue to be implemented through

training of personnel and careful supervision of cases in these

categories. It is not felt any alternate program would increase the

potential for desired results. Within the framework of our investi-

gative jurisdiction, the careful execution of investigative expertise,

training and supervision in these matters have the best potential

for achieving the desired ends with little or no risk or uncertainties

which could affect the program which at all times will be closely

monitored.

These matters are closely coordinated with the Civil Rights Division

of the Department, which formulates basic policy, to insure that

they are handled in accordance with those policies. No program

activities are being terminated or curtailed and no new program

initiatives are planned for fiscal year 1977.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

The major program outputs cover expeditious and thorough investi-

gative activity, as well as training courses which continue to be

implemented based on continued increase of cases handled in this

category over the past years. The program serves the public by

improving their potential for securing their Civil Rights and serves

68

55299

DocId: 32989691 Page 164

---

## Page 165

the Department which reviews results of investigation and makes

the determination as to whether prosecutive action should be taken.

Program Justification:

The primary authority for the FBI's activities in this field is mandated

by, among others, the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, 1968,

the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as well as other legislation in the

Civil Rights and Election Laws field.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

Hearings are currently being held on extension of the Voting Rights

Act of 1965 which will terminate in August, 1975, if not extended.

New provisions being considered will include coverage of Spanish-

• speaking Americans.

There is additional election law legislation

under consideration which could increase the workload in this area

and this program will enable us to effectively meet any additional

workload resulting therefrom.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

The most recently completed formal evaluation of this program is

set forth in the MBO bimonthly progress report dated 5/7/75.

I. A. %. ANTITRUST

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to provide the Antitrust Division

of the Department with investigative and accounting support in

its prosecution of criminal and civil Antitrust actions.

The investigative and accounting support provided by the FBI

coupled with the Department's intensified prosecution of Antitrust

violations are expected to curtail anticompetitive activities which

are presently costing our nation's economy many millions of

dollars annually.

During fiscal year 1974 our investigations in these matters resulted

in 12o convictions, fines imposed amounting to $1, 106, 200, and

recoveries in the amount of $88, 566, 000. During the first three

quarters of fiscal year 1975, as of 3/31/75, our investigations in

these matters resulted in 68 convictions, $1, 256, 000 in fines

imposed and $649, 534 in recoveries.

In order to achieve the program's plan, our Special Agent Accountants

must be fully cognizant of and responsive to the Department's intensi

fication program. Therefore, each Special Agent Accountant is

participating in seminars which include lectures by officials of the

Antitrust Division during the course of the FBI's In-Service training

program. In addition to the Antitrust aspect this program affords

our Special Agent Accountants up-to-date training in computer

methodology and the latest accounting theories and practices. No

program alternatives have been considered.

There are no known risks or uncertainties which may affect the

success of this program.

There are no programs or activities within the programs which are

being terminated or curtailed and no new program initiatives are

planned for fiscal year 1977.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

Investigative reports are submitted to the Department in response

to specific requests for criminal and/or civil Antitrust investigation.

The Antitrust Division of the Department is the direct client served

in addition to the American consumer.

72

## Page 169

Program Justification:

This program is in support of the FBI's mission to assist the

Department in securing the interest of the U. S. Government in

Antitrust matters.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

In December, 1974, the Congress revised the Sherman Antitrust

Act through Public Law 93-528 which increased maximum jail

sentences from one to three years and fines up to $100, 000 for indi-

viduals and $1, 000, 000 for corporations. This legislation is expected

to give added importance to the intensification of the Antitrust program

and may well have a deterrent effect on prospective violators.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

The most recently completed formal evaluation of the Antitrust

program was conducted by the FBI's Inspection Division, the results

of which are contained in that Division's report dated 2/24/75, to the

Associate Director.

FUGITIVE

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to afford assistance to Federal,

state and local agencies through the location of fugitives such as

unlawful flight fugitives, deserters, bond default subjects, parole

and probation violators, escaped Federal prisoners and individuals

sought for violating provisions of the Selective Service Act.

It is anticipated that investigative efforts resulting in the location

oi Federal fugitives sought in the above categories will impact on

public problem areas by confining individuals who are in fugitive

status and thus prone to commit additional crimes. These indivi-

duals, including unlawful flight subjects who, of course, are charged

With state crimes, have been involved in criminal acts which cover

the whole spectrum of crime. The speedy location of such indivi-

duals, thus insuring prompt justice, may serve to reduce those

instances of recidivism.

To illustrate the program impacts to date, FBI investigations

resulted in the location of 30, 286 individuals during fiscal year 1973

who were being sought in the aforementioned categories. As a

further example, in fiscal year 1974, 30, 904 such individuals were

located.

Program plans will hopefully be achieved in the above categories

by emphasizing to FBI investigative personnel the importance of

these investigations and the need for imaginative and aggressive

investigative effort. No program alternatives have been considered.

With regard to the uncertainties which may affect the success of the

program, the Presidential clemency program announced in September,

1974, has drastically reduced the number of Selective Service and

deserter fugitives being sought. FBI investigations were suspended

on all individuals eligible for amnesty. The Presidential amnesty

period concluded on 3/31/75 and the military services are now

reviewing their records so that the FBI will be requested to assist

in locating a number of the deserters who did not apply for amnesty.

With regard to the Selective Service category, the case load has

continued to drop because of the amnesty proclamation and in addition,

on 4/1/75, the 30-day registration provision under the Selective

Service Act for 18-year-olds was terminated by Presidential

proclamation pending new guidelines.

## Page 173

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

The principal outputs under the FBI's fugitive program include

speedy location of fugitives in the categories outlined above and the

development of the necessary evidence for prosecution in the bond

default and escaped Federal prisoner categories. In addition, of

course, the Unlawful Flight Statute is cooperative in nature and

affords the FBI an opportunity to assist state authorities in the

location of felons who have fled across state lines to avoid prose-

cution, custody or confinement. Clients served under this program

include Federal, state and local agencies for which fugitives are

located.

Program Justification:

FBI fugitive investigations in the above categories are carried out

under Federal statutes, Department of Justice directives, or in the

case of military deserters, by agreement with the Department of

Defense.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

There are currently no changes planned to existing legislation or

proposals for new legislation which would increase the probability

of our success in the fugitive program.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

On 5/7/75 a bimonthly progress report was submitted by the FBI

evaluating the effectiveness to date in fiscal year 1975 of Program

Objective No. 11 (Fugitive Program). In addition, the FBI's

Inspection Staff regularly examines and evaluates the fugitive

program both at FBIHQ in Washington and in each of the 59 field

offices.

I. A. 11. a. (1). INTELLIGENCE - ORGANIZED CRIME

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to support the nationwide drive

against organized crime through the development of a corps of

carefully selected, high-level informants familiar with the leader-

ship, structure, operations, associates, and revenue sources of

the organized underworld.

Since this program is in support of Program I. A. 3 (Organized

Crime), its impacts to date and those planned for fiscal year 1977

will be the same as those listed under the Organized Crime Program.

Supervised at FBI Headquarters in Washington is a campaign aimed

at developing informants capable of producing quality information

about the operations of the racket element throughout the United

States.

Each FBI field office is charged with the responsibility of

pinpointing individuals in a position to supply the desired information

and then developing a sustained approach to obtain their eventual

cooperation on a continuing basis. Each target selected for inclusion

in this program must be approved at the Headquarters level, and his

progress is followed at all times to insure that he is receiving

proper guidance and that maximum use is being made of his capa-

bilities.

The only feasible alternative to this informant program would be a

broader use of electronic surveillances under the provisions of

Title IlI of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of

1968. Such an approach, however, would have a number of

drawbacks. To begin with, Title III installations may only be

utilized for brief specified periods of time, whereas a good informant

may be operated in place for several years without jeopardizing

his safety. Secondly, the 1968 statute requires the establishment

of probable cause to believe a person is engaged in a Federal

violation before authorization can be obtained to install coverage

under Title III, and most of this probable cause is supplied by

live informants. Thirdly, informants report on a whole range of

crimes--including local, state, and Federal violations--and

countless dozens of subjects, while a Title III surveillance is

generally limited to one operation and the spin-offs stemming

therefrom. And fourthly, an informant may be asked to explain

an unclear remark, get additional details from his contacts, or

canvass the underworld for information regarding specific hoodlums

and their activities or associates.

80

HН 55299 DocId:32989691 Page 176

## Page 177

In dealing with criminal informants, particularly those reporting

on the operations of organized crime, the primary risks and

uncertainties involve: (1) the safety of the informant, if his coop-

eration with law enforcement becomes known; (2) the possibility

that he may be arrested by another agency for some criminal

violation in which he has become involved; (3) the possibility that

the operating agency will discover the informant is involved in

some activity for which he will have to be arrested by that agency;

and (4) the possibility that the informant may manufacture infor-

mation in order to enhance his own position, obtain more money, or

seek revenge against rivals and/or enemies. (The best protection

against the last contingency is adequate coverage by other sources,

so that regular cross-checks for accuracy can be maintained.)

Although the FBI has no jurisdiction in the field of illicit drugs and

narcotics, considerable attention is given in the development of

informants--as well as the debriefing of subjects in FBI cases--to

the solicitation of data relating to drug offenses for dissemination

to local, state and Federal agencies. In addition, information from

FBI sources is of major assistance to Federal Strike Force attorneys

throughout the country in their coordinated fight against organized

crime.

There are no activities within the FBI's Criminal Intelligence -

Organized Crime Program which are being terminated or curtailed,

nor does the FBI have any new initiatives planned in this field for

fiscal year 1977.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

Since this program is primarily in support of Program I. A. 3

(Organized Crime), its outputs are the same as those listed under

the Organized Crime Program. There are no clients, as such,

served under either program, but the American public benefits from both.

Program Justification:

All criminal intelligence operations carried out by the FBI in the

field of organized crime are directed ultimately at developing

prosecutive data against racket figures under local, state, or

Federal statutes. Organized crime laws falling within the juris-

diction of the FBI are aimed primarily at large-scale gambling,

hoodlum loan-sharking, extortion, labor-racketeering, prostitution,

certain forms of bribery, and criminal infiltration of legitimate

industry.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

There are currently no changes planned to existing legislation or

proposals for new legislation which would increase the probability

of success in the Criminal Intelligence - Organized Crime Program.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

On May 7, 1975, a bimonthly progress report was submitted by the

FBI evaluating the effectiveness to date in Fiscal Year 1975 of

Program Objective No. 2 (Organized Crime), which the Criminal

ntelligence - Organized Crime Program primarily supports. I

iddition, the Bureau's inspection staff regularly examines an

evaluates both programs, on the Headquarters level as well as at

all 59 field offices.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE

I. A. 11. a. (1). INTELLIGENCE - ORGANIZED CRIME

Program Objective:

Provide an intelligence analysis on organized crime for dissemina-

tion to the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice and other

concerned enforcement agencies.

Accountable Program Manager:

William V. Cleveland, Assistant Director

Program Objective Resource Requirements:

Man-Years -

Total Dollars (in thousands) -

$4, 102

Program Objective Description:

ment agencies freely exchange information which they develop during

the course of their hoodlum investigations. The FBI participation in

this exchange is achieved through dissemination of its investigative

reports to Federal Strike Forces stationed around the country and to

the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice for inclusion in its

electronic data bank code-named "Racketeer Profile"; through

dissemination of criminal intelligence data to other Federal, state,

and local agencies; through assistance rendered to the International

Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) by an FBI representative serv-

ing on the IACP's Organized Crime Committee; and through maintenance

of public-source organized crime data at the FBI's Learning Resource

Center in Quantico, Virginia.

Key Milestones:

July 1976 - Analyze the dissemination of information to Federal Strike

Forces and to the Criminal Division's "Racketeer Profile."

September 1976 - Analyze the dissemination of criminal intelligence

information to other Federal, state, and local agencies.

I. A. 11. a. (2). INTELLIGENCE - GENERAL CRIMES

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to support the investigation of general

crimes within the jurisdiction of the FBI--and to impact on the investi-

gations of other Federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies--

through the obtaining of information, the development of legally

admissible evidence for use in court, the location of witnesses, and the

apprehension of fugitives and other subjects of criminal prosecution.

During fiscal year 1977 it is anticipated that this program will impact

on public problems stemming from crimes of violence, the dangers of

air travel attributable to bombers and hijackers, the rising costs of

merchandise and insurance due to theft rates, and the removal of

vicious fugitives from the streets.

During fiscal year 1974 and the first eight months of fiscal year 1975,

information developed by FBI sources led to 11, 223 arrests in FBI

cases and 11, 505 arrests by other Federal, state, and local agencies.

In addition, these sources also made possible the recovery by FBI

Agents of $102, 985, 483 worth of stolen property and the recovery by

other Federal, state, and local agencies of $70, 929, 149 worth of

stolen property and $41, 061, 074 worth of illicit drugs and narcotics.

The achievement of plans, alternatives considered, justification, risks,

and uncertainties for this program are basically the same as those set

forth in Program I. A. 11. a. (1) under the caption "Criminal Intelli-

gence - Organized Crime".

Although there is no joint planning with other agencies, as such, re-

garding the operations of these informants, much of the information

they develop is disseminated to these other agencies, and specific

inquiries from other agencies regarding criminal activities are for-

warded to the informants by the Bureau Agents handling them.

There are no activities within the FBI's Criminal Intelligence - Gen-

eral Crimes Program which are being terminated or curtailed, nor

does the FBI have any new initiatives planned in this field for fiscal

year 1977.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

The major outputs of this program involve the criminal intelligence

developed, the fugitives located, and the stolen property or contra-

band recovered. There are no clients, as such, served by this

program; however, the American public in general benefits.

55299 DocId:32989691 Page 183

87

---

## Page 184

Program Justification:

All intelligence operations carried out by the FBI in the general crim-

inal field are directed ultimately at developing prosecutive data under

local, state, or Federal statutes. Among the more than 150 criminal

statutes enforced by the FBI are

those dealing with bank robberies,

thefts from interstate shipments, interstate transportation of stolen

property, kidnapings, crimes on

Government reservations, and white-

collar crimes.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

There are currently no changes planned to existing legislation or pro-

posals for new legislation which would increase the probability of

success in the Criminal Intelligence - General Crimes Program.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

This program is regularly examined and evaluated by the Bureau's

inspection staff to insure that it is operating with optimum effective-

ness.

I. A. 12. a. TRAINING

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to indoctrinate, train, and counsel

New Agents and to provide refresher and additional skill training for

experienced Agents and non-Agent personnel. The New Agent program

is 15 weeks in length and its terminal objective is to develop recruits

into professional investigators. Specialized courses for experienced

Agents and non-Agents run from one to four weeks. The objectives of

these courses are to reinforce certain skill areas taught during New

Agents training and to develop needed specialized skills. This program

directly supports the FBI's primary investigative and intelligence

objectives by providing trained investigators.

This program will insure that the FBI has a sufficient number of trained

investigators to fulfill its primary mission. As a supportive function,

there are no planned impacts involving public problems in fiscal year

1977 which are capable of being measured quantitatively.

The program impact to date can only be viewed from the fact that the

FBI is generally recognized as the most efficient investigative agency

in the world.

Program plans will be achieved by allocating the necessary instructor

manpower and other physical facilities required to accommodate the

trainee.

Due to the nature of the FBI's broad responsibilities, it is axiomatic

that a training program is required as there is no available supply of

highly trained investigators who can be recruited outside the organiza-

tion.

In conducting this program, the FBI utilizes the most modern teaching

methods available including the use of student response systems, visual

aids, and closed circuit television.

The risks and uncertainties affecting the success of this program per-

tain to budgetary constraints and the ability to recruit candidates meeting

the high standards for the Agent position.

Since this program relates directly to the responsibilities of the FBI,

there is no need for coordination and joint planning with other organiza-

tions outside the FBI.

91

## Page 188

As a result of the influx of New Agents to be trained in fiscal year

1977, there may have to be a curtailment of refresher training offered

to more experienced Agents.

There are no new program initiatives planned for fiscal year 1977,

except as noted below under "Legislation Affecting the Program".

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

During fiscal year 1977, the objective is to train between 800 and 1, 000

New Agents for replacement of retiring investigators. Additionally,

some 2, 000 experienced investigators and approximately 500 non-

Agent personnel will attend specialized training.

Program Justification:

Authority to train employees of the FBI to better enable them to fulfill

their responsibilities is found in 28 CFR, Section 0. 137 and 0.153.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

No legislative changes are required. It is noted that Public Law 93-350

will have a substantial impact on this program. During fiscal year

1977, we anticipate the training of approximately 1, 600 New Agents of

Which about 1, 000 will be required to replace those subject to manda-

tory retirement under Public Law 93-350.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

The Office of Planning and Evaluation recently conducted a study on the

training of investigative personnel. The overall objective of this study

is to determine if the training programs for investigative personnel are

valid and prepare the Agent to perform his functions to the optimum.

The conclusions and recommendations of this study are presently being

reviewed by the Training Division.

In addition, the programs are studied each year by the Inspection

Division, the most recent of which was concluded on 4/2/75.

I. A. 12. b. FORENSIC LABORATORIES

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to provide and improve scientific

support to our own organization and forensic services to other

authorized Federal agencies in both criminal and civil matters.

The impact of such scientific services increases with each passing

year--prompted by the development of new and/or the refinement

of existing techniques, for the examination of evidentiary materials,

and the growing realization within the criminal justice system of

the importance of crime laboratory findings. FBI Laboratory

services are invaluable for the investigative information they

provide to Federal law enforcement officers working on reported

• offenses and to U. S. Attorneys who must make maximum use of the

probative value of laboratory expert testimony.

There are no viable alternatives for the forensic services provided

by the FBI Laboratory to its own organization and to other Federal

agencies and as such there are no plans for the curtailment or

termination of these services.

New program initiatives for fiscal year 1977 involve the improvement

of existing services through research efforts to produce new

techniques for the scientific examination of evidence.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

The program outputs are the scientific examination of evidentiary

materials for the FBI (417, 866 examinations in fiscal year 1974)

and for other Federal agencies (17, 879 such examinations in fiscal

year 1974 for approximately 40 different agencies).

Program Justification:

The fundamental authority for the activities of the FBI is contained

in Chapter 33 of Title 28, U. S. Code which inherently includes

the activities of a forensic laboratory.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

No legislation changes are required.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE

I. A. 12. b. FORENSIC LABORATORIES

Program Objective:

To develop, through scientific research, additional dried blood grouping

procedures and techniques for use in forensic laboratories.

Accountable Program Manager:

Jay Cochran, Jr., Assistant Director

Program Objective Resource Requirements:

Man-Years -

Total Dollars (in thousands) -

$276

Program Objective Description:

Forensic laboratories currently use the ABO, MN and Rh systems in

grouping bloodstains immunologically. Through techniques now in

existence, scientists can determine whether blood is probably or in fact

present; the animal class or order from which the blood originated; and,

if human, the ABO blood group. Further MN and Rh sub-groupings allow

a consecutively more selective classification narrowing down the number

of possible sources.

A measure of the effectiveness of this research will

be the increase in probability toward identifying the source of a dried

bloodstain.

The research being conducted under this program is concerned with the

electrophoretic identification of genetically expressed enzymes and pro-

teins in blood.

As electrolytes, enzymes migrate in an electrical field. Positively

charged molecules migrate to the cathode, negatively charged to the anode.

The greater the net charge, the faster a molecule will move. A mixture

of proteins with different net charges, such as isoenzymes, can therefore

be fractionated or separated by electrophoresis. Specific staining

techniques may then be applied in order to visualize particular isoenzyme

• patterns.

100

HH 55299

DocId: 32989691

Page 196

## Page 197

The multiplicity of enzymes present in each human being and the variety

possible in their physico-chemical properties, which may be determined

in dried bloodstains, offer great potential for additional classification

systems and a great advance toward the individualization of blood.

Key Milestones:

October 1976 - Complete an evaluation of the enzyme systems, in the light

of presently known and established procedures.

May 1977 - Complete development of some of these systems into workable,

reproducible and relatively simple procedures.

August 1977 - Disseminate these procedures to FBI Laboratory personnel

conducting serology examinations and to other Federal and state and local

crime laboratory personnel through publication of these techniques and

through specialized scientific training sessions at the FBI Academy.

I. A. 12.c. FNGERPRINT IDENTIFICATION

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to provide identification and related

services to Federal criminal justice agencies and Government; and

to improve this service through research and development, and

implementation of automated and computerized procedures.

The FBI's Identification Division serves as the central repository for

identification data and as such receives, processes and maintains

fingerprint records which are submitted by Federal, state and local

criminal justice agencies and government; and disseminates corre-

sponding identification records. It is anticipated that fingerprint

receipts for fiscal year 1977 will total 6.34 million. Thus far in

fiscal year 1975, 2. 2 million fingerprint records have been received

from Federal criminal justice agencies.

The program plans will be achieved by maintaining appropriate

contact and liaison with contributing criminal justice agencies as well

as adequate staffing and training in the Identification Division to

accomplish the job to be done.

The Identification Division also provides assistance to authorized

agencies and entities in the resolution of investigative matters through

latent fingerprint examinations, training and instruction in latent

fingerprint matters, and by providing assistance in the identification

of unknown deceased, including disaster victims.

During fiscal year 1977, approximately 41, 000 cases will be received

for latent fingerprint examinations. Approximately 70 advanced

latent fingerprint schools and five administrative advanced latent

fingerprint schools will be conducted for criminal justice agencies, as

well as the training of new FBI Agents in this area. The FBI Disaster

Squad will furnish assistance as needed during fiscal year 1977.

Latent fingerprint examinations received during fiscal year 1975

totaled 35, 011 through April.

This program has impact on the entire investigative mission of the

FBI.

The program furnishes assistance to Federal law enforcement

agencies and other authorized agencies by providing them with a

centralized point where they can determine a person's true identity

and/or ascertain whether or not a person has a record of arrest

involving a serious offense anywhere in the Nation.

The FBI has for several years funded research and development

projects for the purpose of adapting advanced electronic data

processing technology to its fingerprint card processing operations.

One prototype fingerprint reader system known as FINDER is

presently operational in the Identification Division. A contract has

been let with an outside firm for fabrication of five production

models which will be known as FINDER II. This equipment supported

by data processing and storage systems is destined to eventually

assume the major portion of the highly technical work now performed

by approximately 1, 300 fingerprint technicians.

In view of the fact that development of such technology and equipment

is most difficult to schedule, risks and uncertainties which may

affect the success of the program are inevitable. Since the work in

this phase of operation is in large measure performed by private

contractors, the FBI is dependent on those organizations for its

successful accomplishment.

With regard to the research, development, automation and the

necessary equipment, a certain amount of coordination and joint

planning is being made with the National Bureau of Standards, which

is providing technical advice and assistance in this project. This

program is also supportive of the National Crime Information Center's

Computerized Criminal History program, a joint Federal - state

system for the computerized exchange of criminal history information

for criminal justice purposes.

There are no viable alternatives available which accomplish the

desired ends of this program.

There are no program activities being curtailed and no new program

initiatives are being planned for fiscal year 1977.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

Of the 6.34 million fingerprint cards received at the Identification

Division in fiscal year 1977, approximately 29 per cent will be

submitted by other governmental agencies and bodies; approximately

1 per cent submitted by the FBI. Approximately 70 per cent of the

latent fingerprint cases will be in connection with FBI investigative

matters; and about 3 per cent will be cases submitted by Federal

agencies other than the FBI.

103

## Page 200

Another ancillary service provided by the Identification Division is

the processing of name checks and miscellaneous correspondence,

many of which are submitted by governmental agencies and bodies.

It is anticipated that during fiscal year 1977, requests for these

services will total approximately 5. 78 million name checks and

processing of miscellaneous correspondence. Thus far in fiscal

year 1975, one million miscellaneous correspondence inquiries in

forms and name checks have been submitted by Federal criminal

justice agencies.

Program Justification:

The fundamental authority for the activities of the FBI is contained

in Chapter 33 of Title 28, United States Code, which inherently

includes the functions of this program activity. In addition, Section

534 of that Title authorizes the Attorney General to acquire, collect,

classify and preserve identification, criminal identification, crime

and other records and exchange these records with and for the official

use of authorized officials of the Federal Government, the states,

cities, penal and other institutions. The Attorney General has dele-

gated his authority under this statute to the Director of the FBI.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

No legislative changes are required and none are pending.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

The most recently completed formal evaluation of the fingerprint

identification function was conducted by the FBI's Inspection Division,

the results of which are contained in that Division's report dated

12/20/74 to the Associate Director.

DOJ comment 3., 6/3/75: There are no program resource require-

ments for five year planning. The FBI has several programs which

should meet this criterion, i.e., AIDS, FINDER and the automation of

the general index.

I.A. 12.c. FINGERPRINT IDENTIFICATION

Program Resource Requirements for Five-Year Planning Period:

In 1924 the FBI established its Identification Division to act as a

centralized national clearinghouse and repository of fingerprint identi-

fication and arrest records.

The FBI was entrusted with this mission

since many states lacked the resources to satisfy their own identifica-

tion needs and because, even where states had sufficient resources,

they were unable to deal with the increasing mobility of the population.

This mobility posed a requirement that a central point be established

where a single inquiry could be made to determine whether a person

was known to any part of law enforcement throughout the United States,

rather than necessitating the initiation of 48 or more such inquiries to

determine this information. The need for a centralized clearinghouse

for identification information remains today as a continuing require-

ment of the fingerprint identification function since there is presently

no nationwide system available to perform this vital function.

Starting with a base of just over 810, 000 fingerprint cards, the files

of the Identification Division have, over the past 50 years, grown to

approximately 161 million cards representing approximately 60 million

different individuals, 21 million of whom were fingerprinted as a

result of criminal arrest action by law enforcement.

The Division began as a manual operation and through the intervening

years to date still is a manually operated process. Presently the

Division is staffed by approximately 3, 000 employees, of which about

1,300 are engaged in the complex and exacting science of fingerprint

identification by actually searching the incoming fingerprint cards,

which daily average about 23, 000, against the massive file of criminal

arrestee cards retained therein.

The 1,700 other employees are

engaged in performing the ancillary functions of recordkeeping and

management associated with fingerprint identification. The staffing

of this large force of highly trained and skilled employees has presented and

continues to present a major problem to the FBI. The Identification

Division is vital to this Nation's society, as it acts as a "service

bureau" to provide without charge identification and arrest information

to Federal, state and local law enforcement and other authorized

officials, for the purpose of crime control and humanitarian needs.

106.1

## Page 204

The FBI for many years pursued the possibility of harnessing the speed

and accuracy of computer technology to the task of duplicating insofar

as possible the human fingerprint technician's visual and mental

processes and identifying criminals by their fingerprints using a

specially constructed computer to perform this task. In 1967 the FBI,

with the technical assistance of the National Bureau of Standards,

launched a concerted program of research and development with the

purpose of advancing the state of development of computer technology

to a point where automatic fingerprint identification would become a

reality and computerized systems would someday in the future replace

the vast numbers of human fingerprint technicians required in the

Identification Division. This was an ambitious goal because the finger-

print technician is the very heart of the identication function. in

196%, the FBI awarded a contract to Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory,

Inc. to construct a prototype fingerprint-reader system. In September

1972, after over 5 1/2 years of research and development effort and an

expenditure of $1.25 million, the FBI received delivery of the system

which is called "FINDER."

FINDER is capable of electronically scanning

inked fingerprint cards and locating and recording identifying character-

istics found in fingerprints, very much like a human would do it. The

scanned fingerprint data can then be entered into a computer and

compared with a large file of fingerprint data, again a procedure

paralleling the capability of a human fingerprint technician.

Following the delivery of FINDER, it underwent extensive tests to

evaluate and perfect its capabilities. FINDER lived up to all expectations,

and in 1974 the FBI, under Government competitive bidding practices,

contracted with Autonetics Division, Rockwell International Corporation,

to construct five production model FINDER systems at a cost of

$4, 715,000. The first of these FINDER II systems is presently scheduled

for delivery on 11/1/75. It is felt that with the receipt of these five

FINDER Il systems and the one FINDER prototype system, they will be

adequate to handle the workload of the FBI's Identification Division.

Therefore, there are no plans to expend funds for the purchase of

additional FINDER systems.

The FBI is presently pursuing a comprehensive plan for the automation

of the fingerprint card processing and related activities carried on at

the Identification Division. The complete system, which will be

implemented over the next several years, is known as the "Automated

Identification Division System (AIDS)." AIDS will eventually provide

for automatic fingerprint searching (the FINDER systems), computerized

name searching of the criminal name indices, computer storage and

retrieval of arrest record data and the capability to gather criminal

statistics and overall system performance data.

106.2

55299

DocId: 32989691 Page 204

## Page 205

The AIDS system will require the following known general kinds of

equipment: (a) FINDER systems (previously described); (b) data output

processors; (c) CRT key-to-disk terminals; (d) mini-computers; (e) large

general-purpose computer; (f) a mass memory system; (g) special-

purpose high-speed matching processors; (h) CRT verifying terminal

devices. There may also be a need for remote terminal mini-FINDER

systems to be developed. The above is not all inclusive but does give

an idea of the major equipment needed for the full development of AIDS.

Set forth on the following pages is a projected budget estimate for the

development of the AIDS system during the five-year period from

fiscal years 1977 through 1981:

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE

I. A. 12.C. FINGERPRINT IDENTIFICATION

Program Objective:

The FBI is pursuing a comprehensive plan for the automation of the

fingerprint card processing and related activities carried on at the

Identification Division, which functions as the national repository

for fingerprints.

Accountable Program Manager:

Richard H. Ash, Assistant Director

Program Objective Resource Requirements:

Man-Years -

Total Dollars (in thousands) -

538

$15, 827

Program Objective Description:

The program's objective description might be stated as the develop-

ment of a complete automated system that will provide: (a) auto-

matic fingerprint searching, which includes automatic reading,

registration, classification and matching of the unique identifying

characteristics of a fingerprint known as minutiae and ridge direction,

(k) computerized name searching of the criminal name indices, (c)

computer storage and retrieval of arrest record data and (d) the

capability to gather criminal statistics and system performance data.

The complete system is known as Automated Identification Division

System (AIDS). When AIDS is fully developed it will provide the capa-

bility of drastically reducing the amount of time and manpower

presently expended in manually processing fingerprint inquiries.

Evolving from this development will be several potentials that will be

made available to all law enforcement be it local, state or Federal.

One such potential is the possibility of searching latent fingerprints

(i.e., fingerprints found at the scene of a crime) against a vast

computerized fingerprint file and establishing an identification. This

capability is not feasible in a 10-finger manual fingerprint card file

of any significant size let alone the national repository with 21 million

subjects' arrest records. This will permit all of law enforcement to

identify criminals who have heretofore gone undetected. A second

potential is the possible use of automatic fingerprint reader equip-

ment as a means for transmitting fingerprint data over long distances

107

55299 DooId:32989691 Page 211

---

## Page 212

in computer readable format and at computer speeds. This will

drastically speed up one of the slowest processes in fingerprint

identification which is the transmitting of fingerprint cards via

the United States mail service. This suggests that with advancement of

the state-of-the-art of computer technology it may be possible for

distant law enforcement agencies to possess remote fingerprint

reader terminals which would extract the needed characteristics

from the subject's fingers and reduce that data to digital form for

transmitting them to the FBI Identification Division over the National

Crime Information Center's communications network or from a

remote area within a state to the State Identification Bureau, for on-

line searches of the computerized fingerprint data base file. This

would permit positive identification of a criminal subject or suspect

in a matter of seconds or minutes and would result in immeasurable

benefits to all of law enforcement and to other governmental agencies

who rely on such information as well.

Key Milestones:

There are major milestones to be achieved in the development of AIDS

program. These milestones are, however, dependent upon file con-

version from the massive manual files of the national repository to

those of automated files. By fiscal year 1977 the conversion of the

criminal fingerprint card file which is presently in excess of 21 million

subjects will be started. During fiscal year 1978 the automated name

search will be implemented and in fiscal year 1980 the automated fin-

gerprint search will become operational.

I. A. 12. d. LAW ENFORCEMENT INFORMATION AND

DATA SYSTEMS

Program Description:

The National Crime Information Center (NCIC) is a nation-wide

computerized information system established as a service to criminal

justice agencies -- local, state and Federal. Its purpose is to

improve the effectiveness of criminal justice through the more

efficient handling and exchange of documented criminal justice

information. The NCIC makes available, through the use of com-

puters and a communications network, documented information on

serialized stolen property, wanted persons for whom an arrest war-

rant is outstanding, and criminal histories on individuals arrested

and fingerprinted for serious or significant offenses.

Since its inception,NCIC has had the following impact on crime pre-

vention and detection: (1) It has increased the risk of detection and

improved the overall solution rate of crime; (2) It has rapidly

accelerated the growth of state and metropolitan computerized

criminal justice systems; (3) It has established discipline, standards,

and accuracy in the exchange of criminal justice information between

criminal justice agencies; and (4) It has combatted the highly mobile

career criminal by furnishing accurate and timely information. The

increasing participation of criminal justice agencies assures that the

NCIC will continue to impact on crime prevention and detection during

fiscal year 1977. There is no practical alternative which would

serve the purpose of the program. No curtailment of the program is

anticipated and no new programs are currently planned for fiscal

year 1977.

The new Missing Persons File, which will be a locator type file for

missing persons meeting the entry criteria as defined by the NCIC,

will become operational during 1975. It will have no connection

with the criminal data stored in the computer and should be fully

operational during fiscal year 1977. Continual coordination and

joint planning with all criminal justice agencies are required to

assure program success.

The establishment in 1971 of the Computerized Criminal History

(CCH) File as part of the operating NCIC system was a major step

forward in making this system of optimum value to all agencies

involved in the administration of criminal justice. There is an area

of uncertainty in regard to the development of the CCH File caused

109

HIH

55299 DocId: 32989691 Page 213

---

## Page 214

by pending Federal legislation and regulations regarding security and

privacy. The legislation reflects the concern of Congress and the

general public with computerized personal information data banks and

their effect on the right of individual privacy. It is imperative that

such legislation and regulations be carefully drafted in order to

properly balance privacy considerations with the legitimate needs of

law enforcement for information vital to their mission. Unless such

a balance is achieved, the usefulness of CCH and other criminal

justice information systems could be jeopardized.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

The NCIC makes available to criminal justice agencies documented

information on serialized stolen property, wanted persons for whom

an arrest warrant is outstanding, and criminal histories on individuals

arrested and fingerprinted for serious or significant offenses.

Program Justification:

The fundamental authority for the activities of the FBI is contained in

Chapter 33 of Title 28, United States Code, which inherently includes

the functions of this program activity. In addition, Section 534 of that

title authorizes the Attorney General to acquire, collect, classify

and preserve identification, criminal identification, crime and other

records and exchange these records with and for the official use of

authorized officials of the Federal Government, the states, cities,

penal and other institutions. The Attorney General has delegated his

authority under this statute to the Director of the FBI.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

No legislative changes are required nor are any pending other than

indicated above.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

Comptroller General's Report to the Subcommittee on Constitutional

Rights, Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, dated

August 19, 1974, entitled, "How Criminal Justice Agencies Use

Criminal History Information, " B-171019.

A formal evaluation of the NCIC was conducted by the FBI's Inspection

Division.

The results of this evaluation are contained in that Division's

report dated April 26, 1974.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE

I. A. 12. d. - LAW ENFORCEMENT INFORMATION AND DATA SYSTEMS

IV. A. 3. c. (2). - LAW ENFORCEMENT DATA INFORMATION RETRIEVAL

SYSTEMS

Program Objective:

To develop and implement rules and regulations to insure the security

and privacy of information on individuals are protected in Federal

criminal justice information systems operated or funded by the Depart-

ment of Justice.

Accountable Program Manager:

Andrew J. Decker, Jr., Assistant Director

Program Objective Description:

Existing NCIC policies set forth in the NCIC Computerized Criminal

History (CCH) Program Background, Concept and Policy Paper dated

June 11, 1974, sets forth stringent rules to provide security for the

CCH File and the privacy of records therein. Specific rules for

dissemination are also included in the Policy Paper. These rules pro-

vide for dissemination to criminal justice agencies for criminal justice

purposes except as provided by Federal or state statutes and Executive

Orders.

On August 27, 1973, the Attorney General directed the FBI to cooperate

with Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) in drafting

joint regulations on the security and confidentiality of criminal history

record information. This project was to be coordinated by the Office of

Legal Counsel (OLC) in the Department of Justice (DOJ. Proposed

regulations, promulgated by the Attorney General and the Administrator,

LEAA, were published in the Federal Register on February 14, 1974.

The Attorney General directed the OLC, DOJ, to coordinate FBI and

LEAA participation in the commenting process and the preparation of

final regulations. Public hearings began in March and were concluded

on May 2, 1974. After reviewing the various comments, a task force

composed of representatives of LEAA, FBI and OLC redraited the pro-

posed regulations.

НН 55299 DooId:32989691 Page 217

## Page 218

The proposed regulations will govern the dissemination of criminal

history record information. The purpose of these regulations will be

to afford greater protection to information which may be included in

the records of the FBI, criminal justice agencies receiving funds

directly or indirectly from the LEAA, and state and local criminal

justice agencies exchanging records interstate with the FBI or these

federally-funded systems. At the same time, these regulations pre-

serve legitimate law enforcement needs for access to such records.

The regulations will require that each state prepare a detailed and

specific plan establishing a method of developing and maintaining

criminal history record information for serious offenders and for

keeping all such information complete, accurate and current. Also,

each state must certify that it will comply to the maximum extent

feasible with the procedures set forth in its plan. The last part of the

regulations will deal with the Federal system and interstate exchange

of criminal history record information.

This program objective will be to define: (1) the responsibilities of

the FBI; (2) the offenses includable in the records; (3) the acceptable

limits of dissemination of criminal history record information; (4)

an individual's right to access criminal history record information for

purposes of accuracy or completeness; (5) the purpose and make-up

of the NCIC Advisory Policy Board (APB); (6) the rules for participa-

tion in the CCH Program and (7) the responsibilities for maintenance

of data in the CCH File of NCIC.

The proposed regulations reflect the Federal Government's concern

with privacy implications incident to the exchange, dissemination and

use of criminal justice information. The regulations will provide

guidelines to the states in the development of their systems thereby

insuring security and privacy of criminal history record information.

Key Milestones:

September 1977 - All procedures in the approved state plans to be

implemented and fully operational.

I. A. 12. f. LEGAL ATTACHES

Program Description:

The purpose of the FBI overseas liaison program is to insure a

constant and prompt exchange of information and assistance with

foreign law enforcement and security agencies. This is accom-

plished by FBI Agents, known as Legal Attaches, posted abroad

in 16 locations covering over 80 countries.

The program has had, and has, planned impact on the international

nature of crime and subversion by facilitating coordination vital to

the needs in these areas of public concern. During recent fiscal

years (1973 and 1974) 2, 188 FBI fugitives were located abroad, as

were 117 fugitives of other Federal, state, and local agencies.

The

value of recoveries abroad for the period totaled $8, 623, 555 and

242 automobiles stolen in the United States were located in foreign

countries. It is expected similar impacts will be experienced during

fiscal year 1977.

Alternatives to having FBI Agents assigned to certain Embassies are

(1) having other Embassy personnel handle FBI responsibilities;

(2) have FBI work handled by other U. S. Government agencies with

personnel abroad, such as DhA, INs, U. s. Customs service, etc.;

or (3) conduct all

FBl business, having foreign ramifications, by mail,

or other communication, directly with the foreign government. These

possibilities are considered to be grossly inadequate to the needs of

the FBI because they either involve having the FBI work done by

personnel with no experience in law enforcement, or by law enforce-

ment personnel who do not have the training or experience with the

broad scope of investigative responsibilities of the FBl, or would

involve long delays in communication, with possible serious security

risk involved.

The success of the program could be seriously damaged by budgetary

requirements necessitating a cutback in funds essential for personnel

and material to adequately service the program.

Prior to posting FBI personnel overseas, the concurrence of the

U. S. State Department, the appropriate U. S. Ambassador and the

Foreign Ministry of the host government must be obtained. The

U. S. State Department provides office space and other administrative

support of the program on a cost sharing basis.

The Beirut Office was closed February 26, 1975, in the interest

of efficiency and economy, and it is expected that the Singapore

Office will be closed soon

for the same reasons.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

The program outputs are the regular reports of the Legal Attaches

which are usually disseminated to the U. S. Department of Justice

and other appropriate government agencies. The Legal Attache

also relays, with his recommendations, requests of foreign police

agencies for investigation in the United States.

Program Justification:

The fundamental authority for the activities of the FBI is contained

in Title 28, U. S. Code, Section 533, which inherently includes

broad authority for the methods of fulfilling the responsibilities and

the activities authorized.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

No legislation changes are required.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

FBI personnel stationed overseas are very closely supervised by

the Intelligence Division of FBI Headquarters.

The most recently

completed formal evaluation of the overseas liaison program was

conducted by the FBI Inspection Division during late March and

early April, 1975. During the history of the program there have

been a considerable number of openings and closings of offices

overseas, concomitant with the change in the needs of the FBI.

I. A. 12. g. MAINTENANCE OF INVESTIGATIVE RECORDS

Program Description:

The primary purpose of the program is the maintenance and servicing

of all of the FBI's investigative, administrative, and personnel files

in support of its overall mission to investigate crimes within its

jurisdiction as set forth in the various criminal statutes and the over-

all internal security of the United States.

This program has impacts upon public problems in the areas of Right

of Privacy issues and overall government information systems as they

relate to records on individuals and information dissemination. Also,

this Division handles the myriad of requests received under the Free-

dom of Information Act.

The records system is operated by a trained staff of clerical employ-

ees and, depending on the urgency, file searches, if necessary, can

be handled immediately.

No program alternatives have been considered.

Uncertainties which may affect the success of the program are

changing legislation and Archival regulations governing destruction

or non-destruction of records, or additional investigative jurisdic-

tion which may result in a substantial increase in stored data.

No program activities are presently being terminated or curtailed.

New program initiatives in the records keeping function which are

being implemented are related to automation to increase efficiency

and significantly reduce manual clerical costs by eliminating consid-

erable repetitive work inherent in a large manual records system.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

The major outputs of the system are the servicing of all divisions of

the FBI with records to ensure the successful performance of their

missions; the servicing of other governmental agencies and depart-

ments with appropriate information on a need and right to know basis,

and where an official reason exists for such dissemination and the

response to all inquiries relating to the Freedom of Information Act.

118

HH 55299

DocId: 32989691 Page 222

## Page 223

Program Justification:

The FBI is under obligation to act as a clearinghouse for information

which affects the internal security of the United States. This includes

the National Security Act of 1947 and Executive Order 10450 regarding

the Security of Government Employees. Additionally, FBI records

are made available to individuals in accordance with Title 5, USC 552,

the Freedom of Information Act and Department of Justice order num-

ber 502-73 and number 528-73.

Regulations of the National Archives and Records Service, General

Services Administration, which are based on Title 44, Chapter 33,

Sections 3301 and 3302, U.S. Code also govern the records keeping

program.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

No legislation changes are required and none are pending.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

The most recently completed formal evaluation of the records main-

tenance program was conducted by the FBI's Inspection Division, the

results of which are contained in that Division's report dated 3/20/74

to the Associate Director.

The inspection period was 2/11/74 -

2/22/74.

Program Objective:

The effective implementation of the Automated Records Management System

Accountable Program Manager:

John J. McDermott, Assistant Director

Program Objective Resource Requirements:

Man-Years-

Total Dollars (in thousands) -

20

$2, 057

Program Objective Description:

An analysis of our manual records system indicates that automation can

be effectively applied from a records management point of view to cer-

tain basic areas; i.e., (1) the files, (2) index to the files, and (3)

processing of mail. These are the functions that utilize the majority of

personnel and the most significant benefits and cost savings will result

in the automation of the basic records system because of the volume of

material, the frequency of use, the considerable duplication of records

and effort, and the number of employees utilized to service and main-

tain the current manual system for both field and Headquarters.

The key to the location of information contained in our files is the gen-

eral index consisting of index cards primarily listing individuals'

names, but also including information by subject matter. The general

index is used in processing intra-Bureau communications, name check

requests received principally from other government agencies and

requests from supervisory personnel. A pilot study concluded that a

fully automated system for searching the general index is feasible and

would be of significant benefit to the large volume of transactions

processed through the general index both in increased efficiency and

accuracy. Plans for the immediate future call for the collection of

new index information in machine readable form while simultaneously

122.2

55299

DocId: 32989691 Page 228

---

## Page 229

converting information already manually indexed. Long-range plans

include the incorporation of the separate indexes from all field offices

into the general index at FBI Headquarters thereby eliminating duplica-

tion. Field offices will be able to secure, in a matter of minutes, any

information indexed.

The Personnel Automated Records System (PARS), has a computerized

record for each active employee of the FBI. This system uses cathode-

ray tube inquiry devices on-line to the computer and in response to a

file request, this system automatically provides information regarding

the availability, location and up-to-date status of a file.

Current planning provides for the application of the PARS concept to the

6.5 million investigative and administrative files in a system to be

known as the File Automated Control System (FACS). This system will

provide for automatic file control, status of files requested and neces-

sary statistical data on file usage for the purpose of removing inactive

records from prime storage space. An automated procedure for ser-

ializing incoming material for the files, and for maintaining an up-to-

date accounting for material in the files is also planned. This system

will be known as Automation of Incoming Mail Serialization (AIMS) and

will be implemented with the FACS system.

The automated systems, when merged together, will provide capabilities

in the utilization of data not possible in the existing manual system, and

will provide for new concepts in record-keeping and record-processing

functions. Secure lines will allow for comprehensive source entry

concepts and will automatically provide necessary management infor-

mation. Because of the magnitude of the records system, automation

must proceed on a phased implementation basis. When fully imple-

mented, the system will

l yield increased efficiency and substantial

savings in personnel.

Due to the continuing growth of file material, an automated, cost effec-

ive, on-line high density storage and retrieval system, with remote

nput access together with printout capability applicable to Bureau

files, is a desirable goal. Such a system is not available in today's

market; however, relevant exploitable technology exists and research

will be directed toward an intensified analysis of the file storage prob-

lem to meet future needs.

IV. A. 3. a. (2). TRAINING - GENERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to increase the effectiveness of local,

regional, and state law enforcement agencies through training and

educational assistance.

Much of the impact of this program will be geared toward the common

problems encountered by law enforcement agencies on a community

and regional level. Much of the impact will be directed toward terror-

ist and other national groups whose aim may be bent on disruption or

other criminal acts which may. cause embarrassment to the U.S. Gov-

ernment. Such incidents have been occurring throughout the world

with increasing frequency.

Future events such as the 1976 Olympics in

Montreal and the Bicentennial celebration in the U.S. would serve as

excellent vehicles for such activity.

The cooperative training assistance provided by the FBI in response to

requests from Federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies

included 343, 104 officers who attended 11, 103 training schools in local-

ities throughout the Nation during the 1974 fiscal year. Instruction was

provided in such critical areas as organized crime, kidnapings, white-

collar crime, terrorist extremism, police-community relations,

bombing investigations, hostage negotiations, Anti-Sniper and Survival

Training, and various legal subjects. Members of the FBI Academy

staff also conducted advanced specialized field schools in criminology,

police management and instructor development.

In response to the recent increase in kidnapings and crimes involving

hostages, the FBI, in 1974, conducted a nationwide series of confer-

ences on the topic 'Kidnapings and Hostage Situations". These confer-

ences were designed to provide forums at which representatives from

the entire law enforcement community would discuss protective

measures and planned responses to these crimes. A total of 275 con-

ferences, attended by 25, 966 individuals representing 6, 949 different

criminal justice agencies, were conducted during the year.

Appropriate plans will be achieved by maintaining communication with

the respective Special Agents in Charge of each field office to deter-

mine training needs and problems. It will also be necessary to insure

that the appropriate number of instructors are trained and available.

It will also require continuing research to insure topical areas are

relevant to current and future needs.

123

HN 55299 Do0Id:32989691 Page 231

## Page 232

Alternatives considered were: discontinuing all training assistance to

those outside the FBI; providing only field training for local law enforce-

ment agencies; and, providing highly specialized training at the FBI

Academy, however, these alternatives were rejected as inadequate.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

This program will be accomplished by participation of Special Agent

instructors in over 10, 000 field schools with 87, 000 hours of instruction

being contributed. The FBI National Academy will invite 1, 000 mem-

bers from the Criminal Justice System to attend its 11-week course.

This will bring the number of National Academy graduates at the con-

clusion of this fiscal year to 11, 100, of which over y

ment officers are expected to remain active. In addition, at least 2, 000

individuals will be invited to attend a series of specialized courses of

one to four weeks in duration. By receiving this professional training,

these individuals will be better equipped to cope with the nationwide

problem of crime causation, detection, and apprehension.

Program Justification:

The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Public Law

90-351, is the basic authority for rendering training assistance to mem-

bers of the Criminal Justice System. The Department of Justice has

repeatedly gone on record in support of this program as have numerous

members of Congress. No legislative changes are pending or required.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

The formal evaluation process for the field police training is accom-

plished during the recurring inspection of the field offices by the FBI's

Inspection Division.

A variety of evaluation measures are used in regard to the National

Academy program. These include reaction, post and peer evaluations.

The entire program at Headquarters is subject to the scrutiny of the

Inspection Division, the last inspection concluding on 4/2/75.

IV. A. 3. c. (1). MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL

DATA ASSISTANCE

Program Description:

The purpose of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program is to collect

crime statistics, to provide them to law enforcement agencies, and to

publish these statistics for public consumption. Collecting and

publishing the statistics have an impact on crime prevention programs.

To date the program has aided law enforcement agencies in planning

their activities and legislators in devising crime prevention legisla-

tion. There is no alternative which would serve the purpose of the

program and there are no risks or uncertainties which would affect

this program. No curtailment of the program is anticipated and no

new programs are planned for fiscal year 1977.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

The major products of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program are the

publications entitled: "Crime in the United States," and "Law Enforce-

ment Officers Killed Summary".

The publications serve all law enforcement agencies, legislative

bodies, and judicial systems. They also aid agencies such as the

Law Enforcement Assistance Administration in allocating Federal

funds to local and state law enforcement agencies.

Program Justification:

The fundamental authority for the activities of the FBI is contained in

Chapter 33 of Title 28, United States Code, which inherently includes

the functions of this program activity. In addition, Section 534 of that

Title authorizes the Attorney General to acquire, collect, classify

and preserve identification, criminal identification, crime and other

records and exchange these records with and for the official use of

authorized officials of the Federal Government, the states, cities,

penal and other institutions. The Attorney General has delegated his

authority under this statute to the Director of the FBI.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

No legislative changes are required for the program and none are

pending.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

The FBI manages the Uniform Crime Reporting Program under the

auspices of the International Association of Chiefs of Police and

National Sheriffs Association. A committee made up of representa-

tives from each of these organizations acts as advisors to the FBI

and constantly evaluates the program.

A formal evaluation of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program was

conducted by the FBI's Inspection Division in 1974. The results of

this evaluation are contained in that Division's report dated April 26,

MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL DATA

ASSISTANCE

Workload and Man-Year Data:

Uniform Crime Reporting Program

In this statistical program, quantitative workload indicators are

difficult to assess and would be misleading. This is because the

incidence of crimes reported are actually inputs into the various

report outputs as indicated below.

On a monthly basis, this program collects raw crime statistical

data from over 10, 000 individual law enforcement agencies nation-

wide. This information is collected via the receipt of approximately

140,000 reports annually. The various reports differ substantially

as to their complexity and the time required to process and collate

them. The data is analyzed and published in several formats as

follows:

(1) Quarterly releases indicating crime

trend information in each of seven

categories of crime.

(2) Annual publication of "Crime in the

United States."

(3) Annual publication of "Assaults on

Federal Officers."

(4) Annual, semiannual, and monthly

releases concerning bombing

incidents in the U. S.

(5) Annual and monthly releases on law

enforcement officers killed.

Since 1967, personnel of the UCR Section have been working closely

with state agencies in the planning, development, and implementation

of 31 state UCR programs. An additional nine state programs are

currently being developed each of which will require an extensive

amount of technical assistance and training of state program personnel,

field representatives, and records personnel in state, county, and

local law enforcement agencies.

IV. A. 3. c. (2). LAW ENFORCEMENT DATA INFORMATION

RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS

Program Description:

The National Crime Information Center (NCIC) is a nation-wide

computerized information system established as a service to criminal

justice agencies -- local, state and Federal. Its purpose is to

improve the effectiveness of criminal justice through the more effi-

cient handling and exchange of documented criminal justice infor-

mation. The NCIC makes available, through the use of computers

and a communications network, documented information on serialized

stolen property, wanted persons for whom an arrest warrant is out-

standing, and criminal histories on individuals arrested and finger-

printed for serious or significant offenses.

Since its inception, NCIC has had the following impact on crime

prevention and detection: (1) It has increased the risk of detection

and improved the overall solution rate of crime; (2) It has rapidly

accelerated the growth of state and metropolitan computerized

criminal justice systems; (3) It has established discipline, standards,

and accuracy in the exchange of criminal justice information between

criminal justice agencies; and (4) It has combatted the highly mobile

career criminal by furnishing accurate and timely information. The

increasing participation of criminal justice agencies assures that the

NCIC will continue to impact on crime prevention and detection during

fiscal year 1977. There is no practical alternative which would serve

the purpose of the program. No curtailment of the program is antici-

pated and no new programs are currently planned for fiscal year 1977.

The new Missing Persons File, which will be a locator type file for

missing persons meeting the entry criteria as defined by the NCIC,

will become operational during 1975. It will have no connection with

the criminal data stored in the computer and should be fully oper-

ational during fiscal year 1977. Continual coordination and joint

planning with all criminal justice agencies are required to assure

program success.

The establishment in 1971 of the Computerized Criminal History

(CCH) File as part of the operating NCIC system was a major step

forward in making this system of optimum value to all agencies

involved in the administration of criminal justice. There is an area

of uncertainty in regard to the development of the CCH File caused

by pending Federal legislation and regulations regarding security

131

HН 55299 Do0Id:32989691 Page 239

## Page 240

and privacy. The legislation reflects the concern of Congress and

the general public with computerized personal information data

banks and their effect on the right of individual privacy. It is

imperative that such legislation and regulations be carefully drafted

in order to properly balance privacy considerations with the legiti-

mate needs of law enforcement for information vital to their mission.

Unless such a balance is achieved, the usefulness of CCH and other

criminal justice information systems could be jeopardized.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

The NCIC makes available to criminal justice agencies documented

intormation on serialized stolen property, wanted persons for whom

an arrest warrant is outstanding, and criminal histories on individuals

arrested and fingerprinted for serious or significant offenses.

Program Justification:

The fundamental authority for the activities of the FBI is contained in

Chapter 33 of Title 28, United States Code, which inherently includes

the functions of this program activity. In addition, Section 534 of that

Title authorizes the Attorney General to acquire, collect, classify

and preserve identification, criminal identification, crime and other

records and exchange these records with and for the official use of

authorized officials of the Federal Government, the states, Cities,

penal and other institutions. The Attorney General has delegated his

authority under this statute to the Director of the FBI.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

No legislative changes are required nor are any pending except as set

forth above.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

Comptroller General's Report to the Subcommittee on Constitutional

Rights, Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, dated

August 19, 1974, entitled, "How Criminal Justice Agencies Use

Criminal History Information, " B-171019.

A formal evaluation of the NCIC was conducted by the FBI's Inspection

Division. The results of this evaluation are contained in that Division's

report dated April 26, 1974.

IV. A. 3. d. (2). FORENSIC LABORATORIES

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to provide and improve the forensic

services rendered in criminal matters to authorized state and local

law entorcement agencies, and to provide specialized scientific

training for personnel of state and local crime laboratories.

This program has had considerable impact within the criminal justice

system in the past and this impact will be increased during fiscal

year 1977. These forensic services are invaluable for the inves-

tigative information they provide to state and local law enforcement

officers working on reported offenses and to prosecuting attorneys who

must make maximum use of the probative value of laboratory expert

testimony.

The training in specialized scientific matters for personnel of state

and local crime laboratories, initiated in April, 1974, is aimed at up-

grading the capabilities of these laboratories.

It is believed that the

training accomplished to date has impacted on the criminal justice

system, and that this impact will be even greater in fiscal year 1977.

Since every state and local law enforcement agency does not have

forensic services of a state or local crime laboratory available to

them, there would appear to be no viable alternative to the continua-

tion of this program. As to the training phase of this program, it was

instituted at the request of state and local crime laboratory directors.

There would appear to be no viable alternative to this type training as,

according to those directors, it is not available anywhere else.

This program will be achieved through utilization of existing resources

at the FBI Academy and by a special effort on the part of FBI Labora-

tory scientific personnel to organize their analytical procedures in

lecture form and share their expertise through lectures and demonstra-

tions.

This program, particularly as it pertains to the referral of evidentiary

materials from state and local crime laboratories to the FBI Labora-

tory for examination and the specialized training provided personnel

of those laboratories, is closely coordinated through the "American

Society of Crime Laboratory Directors".

135

DocId:32989691 Page 243

## Page 244

No facets of this program are presently being considered for curtail-

ment or termination. New initiatives in this program planned for fiscal

year 1977, are the application of new techniques now being researched,

to the examination of evidence, and the dissemination of information

concerning these techniques to the state and local crime laboratories.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

The program outputs are the scientific examinations of evidentiary

materials for authorized state and local law enforcement agencies

and specialized scientific training for personnel of state and local

crime laboratories.

In fiscal year 1974, 121,709 such examinations were

conducted for these agencies, which represented all 50 states, the

District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Panama Canal Zone, the Vir-

gin Islands and the trust territories of Guam and Saipan.

As of 6/30/75, approximately 1, 000 employees of state and local

laboratories, again representing virtually every state in the U.S., will

have received the specialized scientific training at the FBI Academy.

Program Justification:

The fundamental authority of the FBI is contained in Chapter 33 of

Title 28, U.S. Code. Additional authority pertaining to the training

aspect of this program is contained in the Omnibus Crime Control

and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Section 404 (a) codified at Section 3744

(a) (1) of Title 42, U.S. Code.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

No legislative changes are required and none are now pending.

Evaluation of On-Going Programs:

The most recently completed formal evaluation of this program was

conducted by the FBI's Inspection Division, the results of which are

contained in that Division's report dated 8/14/74 to the Associate

Director.

IV. A. 3. e. FINGERPRINT IDENTIFICATION

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to provide identification and related

services to state and local criminal justice agencies, and to other

authorized agencies and entities; and to improve this service through

research and development, and implementation of automated and

computerized procedures.

The FBI's Identification Division serves as the central respository for

identification data and as such receives, processes and maintains

fingerprint records which are submitted by Federal, state and local

criminal justice agencies and government; and disseminates corres-

ponding identification records. It is anticipated that fingerprint receipts

for fiscal year 1977 will total 6. 34 million. Thus far in fiscal year

1975, 3.6 million fingerprint records have been submitted by state

and local criminal justice agencies.

The Identification Division also provides assistance to authorized agen-

cies and entities in the resolution of investigative matters through

latent fingerprint examinations, training and instruction in latent finger-

print matters, and by providing assistance in the identification of un-

known deceased, including disaster victims.

The program plans will be achieved by maintaining appropriate contact

and liaison with contributing criminal justice agencies as well as ade-

quate staffing and training in the Identification Division to accomplish

the job to be done.

During fiscal year 1977, approximately 41, 000 cases will be received

for latent fingerprint examinations. Approximately 70 advanced latent

fingerprint schools and five administrative advanced latent fingerprint

schools will be conducted for criminal justice agencies. The FBI

Disaster Squad will furnish assistance as needed during fiscal year

1977. A total of 35, 011 cases have been received during fiscal year

1975 for latent fingerprint examinations.

The Identification Division also expunges arrest data by returning

fingerprints to the arresting agency upon request or as the result of a

court order. The return of the fingerprints results in the automatic

and complete expunction of arrest data from FBI files.

139

HH 55299 DooId:32989691 Page 247

---

## Page 248

An additional aspect of this program provides a procedure whereby a

private citizen may obtain a copy of his identification record from the

Identification Division. Departmental Order 556-73 sets forth this

procedure.

It is expected that this procedure will continue in effect

with possible minor revisions to include review and appeal procedures.

This does not constitute a new program objective, however, an increase

of unknown size is expected due to increased awareness on the part of

arresting agencies and private citizens who will be making expunge -

ment requests.

This program has impact on the entire investigative mission of the FBI.

The program furnishes assistance to state and local law enforcement

and governmental agencies, and other authorized agencies by providing

them with a centralized point where they can determine a person's true

identity and/or ascertain whether or not a person has a prior record of

arrest involving a serious offense anywhere in the nation. Due to the

extensive travel and mobility of the criminal, this program provides

an infallible means of identification of the wanted criminal who uses

state and national boundaries and fictitious identities to avoid apprehen-

sion.

Presently this work is performed manually by a staff of more than

3, 000 employees. The fingerprint cards are manually searched through

the massive name card indices and fingerprint card files. However,

the FBI has for several years funded research and development pro-

jects for the purpose of adapting advanced electronic data processing

technology to its fingerprint card processing operations.

One prototype fingerprint reader system known as FINDER is presently

operational in the Identification Division. A contract has been let with

an outside firm for fabrication of five production models which will be

known as FINDER II. This equipment supported by data processing

and storage systems is destined to eventually assume the major por-

tion of the highly technical work now performed by approximately 1, 300

fingerprint technicians.

In view of the fact that development of such technology and equipment

is most difficult to schedule, risks and uncertainties which may affect

the success of the program are inevitable. Since the work in this

phase of operation is in large measure performed by private contractors,

the FBI is dependent on those organizations for its successful accom-

plishment.

With regard to the research, development, automation and the neces-

sary equipment, a certain amount of coordination and joint planning is

being done with the National Bureau of Standards, which is providing

technical advice and assistance in this project. This program is also

supportive of the National Crime Information Center's Computerized

Criminal History program, a joint Federal - state system for the

computerized exchange of criminal history information for criminal

justice purposes.

There are no viable alternatives available which accomplish the desired

ends of this program.

There are no program activities being curtailed and no new program

initiatives are being planned for fiscal year 1977.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

Of the 6. 34 million fingerprint cards received at the Identification Divi-

sion in fiscal year 1977, approximately 70 per cent will be submitted

by state and local criminal justice agencies. Approximately 27 per cent

of the latent fingerprint cases will be received from state and local

criminal justice agencies.

Other ancillary services which are provided, utilizing the fingerprint

files, include the processing of name checks and miscellaneous corres-

pondence, identification and location of wanted persons and the location

of missing persons. It is anticipated that during fiscal year 1977,

requests for these services will total approximately 5. 78 million name

checks and processing of miscellaneous correspondence; 220, 000

requests to post or cancel wanted notices which will result in the iden-

tification of 36,500 fugitives; and 1, 500 requests will be received to

place stops to assist in locating missing persons. Thus far in fiscal

year 1975, 4. 2 million inquiries in the form of miscellaneous forms

and name checks have been submitted by local and state criminal jus-

tice agencies, as well as 128, 830 requests to post or cancel wanted

notices.

Program Justification:

The fundamental authority for the activities of the FBI is contained in

Chapter 33 of Title 28, U.S. Code, which inherently includes functions

of the Identification Division. This program supports the FBI's mis-

sions to "provide and improve scientific and technical support services";

"increase effectiveness of criminal justice system through education

and training"; "afford aid to other criminal justice and military agen-

cies through location of fugitives"; and "assist other criminal justice

agencies by dissemination of criminal intelligence information within

their investigative purview".

Legislation Affecting the Program:

No legislative changes are required and none are pending.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

The most recently completed formal evaluation of the fingerprint iden-

tification function was conducted by the FBI's Inspection Division, the

results of which are contained in that Division's report dated 12/20/74

to the Associate Director.

POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to develop and encourage creative,

innovative and viable changes within the FBI and to enable this

organization to discharge its mandated responsibilities in a truly

professional, competent manner.

The impacts on public problems are indirect and will be

brought about by the increased level of efficiency envisioned by

this program, not only in the FBI but law enforcement in general,

and will substantially reduce the opportunities for crime.

Impacts to date can be found in probative studies now being conducted

on the effectiveness ot investigations, use of advanced technology,

career development and crime prevention.

Programs will be achieved through management development and

training of all personnel to insure proper motivation as well as

recognition and achievement of the goals of this agency.

No program alternatives have been considered and none are believed

to exist.

There are no risks or uncertainties which could affect the success

of this program. Lack of innovation brings stagnation; lack of

response to contemporary change is a disservice to the public.

While there is coordination and joint planning with the Department

as well as other agencies within the Executive Branch of Government,

this program is self-initiated for the most part to meet the specific

needs of this Bureau.

This program is ongoing and is expected to continue with the same

thrust and emphasis as described above with no specific programs

or iniatives contemplated for termination or curtailment.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

This program is designed to provide a highly trained professional

and competent agency. The principal clients directly served are the

employees of the FBI and those indirectly served are branches of

Federal Government, state and local law enforcement, and the

public at large.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

There is no known legislation pending which would affect this program.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

While there is no formal evaluation of this program, the activities

of this agency are monitored internally by the Inspection Division

as well as the Office of Planning and Evaluation, and externally

by the Department of Justice, OMB and Congressional Appropriations

and Oversight Committees.

EXTERNAL AFFAIRS

Program Description:

The purpose of this program, employing all available communi-

cations media, is to increase public awareness of the responsibilities

and services of the FBI and to alert the public to the criminal and

subversive dangers threatening society, thereby encouraging

citizen cooperation in combating those elements which constitute

critical and costly problems to each member of society. In addition,

liaison is maintained with congressional committees having oversight

responsibilities or a legislative interest in matters affecting the

FBI.

The planned fiscal year 1977 impacts are improved public assistance

and expanded support and training services to law enforcement

agencies on all levels. Program impacts to date are reflected by

statistically demonstrated expanded accomplishments in cited areas.

Program plans will be achieved through issuance of press releases,

fugitive alerts, news interviews, feature articles, publications,

taped and "live" radio and television announcements and network

and local radio and television programs and through a continuous

review of new and pending legislation and consultation with the

Department and congressional committees. Other achievement

means are: meaningful responses to voluminous mail inquiries;

daily public tours of FBI Headquarters; similar tours of some

field offices; speeches before civic and school groups; dissemination

of reprints on such topics as civil rights, organized crime, internal

security, police training, scientific laboratory examinations,

fingerprint identification and computerized criminal records.

There are no known program alternatives more suitable or

appropriate than those currently employed.

Program success, though subject to influence by social and

economic pressures, can be solidly anticipated by virtue of the

inherent qualified and dedicated input, plus recorded experience.

Cooperation between law enforcement agencies on all levels is a

basic necessity in assuring program success and is an elementary

concept avidly pursued by the FBI. Congressional liaison is

coordinated with the Department's Office of Legislative Affairs.

No programs or program activities are being terminated or curtailed

and no new program initiatives are planned for fiscal year 1977.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

Program outputs include the varied correspondence and reprint items

disseminated; public and press inquiries handled; press releases and

statements issued; speeches delivered; tour visitors accommodated;

publications prepared and distributed; articles written; and radio and

television announcements delivered or

recorded. The American public

comprises the clients served.

The major program output of its

congressional liaison effort is its continuing review of new and pending

legislation. The FBl itself is its direct client.

• Program Justification:

Chapter 33 of Title 28, U. S. Code, provides fundamental authority

for FBI activities and inherently requires the public accountability

• and responsiveness supplied by this program.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

No legislative changes required nor are any pending.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

VI. A. 3. LEGAL COUNSEL

Program Description:

The Legal Counsel Division provides legal advice to the Director and

others within the Bureau, exercises supervision of legal instruction

matters within the FBI, conducts research on legal problems affecting

the FBI, follows new developments in the law and provides a continuing

program of training for FBI personnel. 'This includes general training

for new Agents and those receiving In-Service training and specialized

training for legal instructors assigned to each field office. Law trained

Special Agents provide legal instruction for law enforcement officers

attending sessions at the FBI Academy.

Impacts for fiscal year 1977 and to date are internal and not subject to

quantitative measurement.

This program will be achieved by continuously performing legal

research and providing instruction for law enforcement. No alterna-

tive programs have been considered. Budgetary restrictions in not

making available necessary personnel could affect the success of the

program. No program activities are being curtailed and no new initia-

tives are planned for fiscal year 1977.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

Outputs of this Division include the instruction given to FBI Agents and

local law enforcement officers. The clients served are all FBI Agents,

state and local law enforcement officers, as well as the public.

Program Justification:

The justification for this program is in support of the total mission of

the FBI. The law as it relates to law enforcement is constantly chang-

ing and it is imperative that continuous research and instruction be

conducted to insure Agents and others are aware of the changes.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

No legislative changes are required.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

The most recently completed formal evaluation was conducted by the

FBI's Inspection Division, the results of which are contained in that

151

55299 DooId: 32989691 Page 259

## Page 260

Division's report dated August 16, 1974, to the Associate Director.

Our continuing research and review of legal matters encompasses all

facets of FBI activity and is designed to insure our investigative opera-

tions comply with all legal requirements. There has been no outside

evaluation.

VI. A. 5. a. MANAGEMENT DIRECTION

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to develop and implement management

procedures based upon the views of the Director to enable the investi-

gative and service personnel to accomplish the specific and overall

missions of the FBI in the most efficient and competent fashion possi-

ble adhering to the applicable laws and regulations affecting the opera-

tion of the FBI.

As to impacts on public problems, there are the subtle effects of the

FBI successfully fulfilling its missions while expending the lowest

amount of taxpayers' dollars possible because of the application of its

management direction.

Impacts to date may be expressed in terms of general statistical accom-

plishments. The FBI in the fiscal year 1974 was responsible for fines,

savings and recoveries totaling in excess of $489 million and for the

location of more fugitives and criminals convicted than in any preceding

fiscal year.

No program alternatives have been considered and none are believed to

exist.

There are no risks or uncertainties that could affect the success of this

program if these management procedures which have evolved over the

years based on experience and judgement remain in effect. This is not

to preclude improvement in procedures where circumstances indicate.

A considerable amount of planning and coordination is accomplished on

a day-to-day basis with the Department of Justice and its various oper -

ating arms, as well as sundry other interested agencies of the Federal

Government in order to assure the success of the FBI's management

direction program. The very nature of overall administrative duties

in the FBI requires a substantial amount of coordination and planning

with individuals and groups, both in the Government and the private

sector.

No material changes in administrative activities are planned during the

1977 fiscal year, but it is recognized that the various activities may

require varying amounts of attention depending on external events

which are beyond the immediate control of FBI management.

154

177 55299

DocId: 32989691 Page 262

---

## Page 263

No specific new program initiatives relating to management direction

are planned for the 1977 fiscal year. Continuous efforts are made to

improve in this area of FBI activities.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

As alluded to earlier, this program is designed to support the accom-

plishment of the overall investigative and service missions of the FBI,

and to do so in the most economical method possible. Accordingly,

program outputs as such are inherently nebulous in nature and direct

clients (outside of operating Divisions within the FBI) are difficult to

identify. In a larger sense, all Americans are clients as they derive

indirect benefits from the on-going investigative and service programs

of the FBI which are being pursued in an effective and responsive

manner.

Program Justification:

Chapter 33, Title 28, United States Code contains the fundamental

authority for the activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation which

carries with it the authority to administer those activities in an effi-

cient and proper manner.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

At the present time, there is no known legislation pending which would

affect the overall management direction of the FBI. Similarly no new

legislation appears needed.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

The Administrative Division of the FBI, of which this program is a

part, is regularly subjected to a detailed and thorough inspection by the

FBI's Inspection Division. The last such inspection was performed in

late 1974 and the results of this inspection are contained in the Inspec-

tion Division's report dated 11/1/74 to the Associate. Director.

PROGRAM ANALYSIS, PROGRAM

EVALUATION AND BUDGET

(Program Analysis and Program Evaluation)

Program Description:

Serving in an advisory capacity to the Director, the Office of Planning

and Evaluation (OPE) handles special assignments and conducts com-

prehensive studies of various FBI policies, procedures and general

operations, making recommendations regarding policy changes and

long-range planning geared to strengthening the capabilities of the

organization to perform its assigned functions. The task includes the

constant evaluation of FBI programs and procedures to determine which

are working well and should be retained, which procedures may be out-

dated, or not performing effectively, and accordingly should be modi-

fied or eliminated, and what alternative approaches are needed.

In developing the necessary data on the above, extensive surveys and

studies are undertaken involving analysis, research and the tapping of

the resources and opinion of not only FBI personnel but other sectors

of Government, industry and law enforcement as well.

Operating on the premise that law enforcement must progress faster

than the element it is combatting, OPE endeavors to anticipate needs

and plan accordingly. Since change is symptomatic of progress not

only in business and industry but also in law enforcement, changes

suggested by the continuing inquiries of this Office are attempted to be

brought about in the most orderly fashion possible.

No alternatives have been considered and there are no known risks or

uncertainties which may affect the success of the program. As this

promine is in other beaten it nization or it government

agencies is required. No program activities are being terminated or

curtailed and no new initiatives are planned.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

The major results of this program activity are represented in internal

recommendations for various policy and procedural changes resulting

from OPE conducted studies and program analyses. The only client

served is the FBI itself including its employees.

Program Justification:

The Office of Planning and Evaluation was established within the organ-

izational structure of the FBI in 1972 to serve in an advisory capacity

to the Director and to conduct comprehensive studies and analyses of

various FBl policies, procedures and general operations, making

recommendations regarding policy changes and long-range planning

geared to strengthening the capabilities of the organization to perform

its assigned functions. This mandate continues as the justification

for this program activity.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

There are no known existing legislative proposals that would affect

this program activity and none are believed needed.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

The most recent formal evaluation of this program activity is entitled:

"The Office of Planning and Evaluation: A Review of Its Organization,

Management and Operations: A Report to Clarence M. Kelley, Director,

Federal Bureau of Investigation, " by Frank J. Leahy, Jr., Manage-

ment Consultant.

(Budget)

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to formulate and justify a proposed

budget reflecting the fiscal needs for the budget year and future budget

years for presentation to the Department of Justice, the Office of

Management and Budget and the Congress and thereafter, the control

and accounting for the execution of approved funds.

The nature of this program itself is such that there are no significant

past or planned impacts on public problems; however, the effects of

this activity are realized in the other program activities which directly

impact on public problems.

Budget formulation and justification is achieved through coordination

with all Divisions through their respective Assistant Directors (Pro-

gram Managers) to collect the necessary data with respect to antici-

pated fiscal needs and the justification thereof. The control and

accounting for the execution of approved funds are achieved through

sound accounting procedures and management reporting. There are

no viable alternatives available which accomplish the desired ends of

this program.

Due to the nature of the FBI's investigative responsibilities, there are

situations over which little control can be exercised such as new legis-

lation increasing or decreasing these responsibilities or activity

necessitating fast moving extensive investigations which could not be

reasonably anticipated.

It is necessary to coordinate the budget formulation process with repre-

sentatives of the Office of Management and Finance of the Department

of Justice, the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional

Budget Office in varying degrees as problems arise. No programs or

program activities are being terminated or curtailed and no new pro-

gram initiatives are planned for fiscal year 1977.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

The program outputs are the budget submissions to the Department of

Justice and other agencies and bodies and the internal and external

fiscal reports.

The budget function, internal in nature serves the

operational activities of the FBI and those agencies and bodies charged

with the authorization and monitoring of the funding of those activities.

Program Justification:

The fundamental authority for the activities of the FBI is contained in

Chapter 33 of Title 28, U.S. Code which inherently includes the budget

function for the activities authorized.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

No legislative changes are required and none are currently pending.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

The most recently completed formal evaluation of the budget function

was conducted by the FBI's Inspection Division, the results of which

are contained in that Division's report dated 11/1/74 to the Associate

Director.

The FBI is currently engaged in an intensive effort to modernize and

strengthen its accounting system in order that it will fully comply with

principles and standards established by the General Accounting Office.

This review encompasses all facets of the FBI's financial activities,

including accounting and budgeting functions.

Program Objective:

To design and implement a case weighing system to allow a more precise

estimate of manpower requirements.

Accountable Program Manager:

Richard J. Gallagher, Assistant Director

Program Objective Resource Requirements:

Man-Years -

Total Dollars (in thousands) -

3

$86

Program Objective Description:

To operate effectively and within available manpower limitations, an

organization must recognize and engage in some type of overall task

evaluation and manpower assignment. In order to achieve the stated

Objective, the Oftice of Planning and Evaluation will determine, through

analysis of existing procedures, the need to design a case weighing

system in order to devise a more precise method of determining man-

power assignments and requirements. In the event procedural changes

are warranted, new systems will be designed and introduced. A

determination will be made thereafter of their impact.

Key Milestones:

(1) October 1, 1976 - Will identify and analyze current procedures

followed to determine manpower requirements and assignments within

the organization.

(2) January 1, 1977 - Will determine need for a more precise method

of determining manpower requirements and assignments.

(3) September 30, 1977 - An evaluation will be made of any procedural

changes introduced to develop a more precise method of determining

manpower requirements and assignments.

VI. A. 5. c. INTERNAL INSPECTIONS

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to determine through systematic

reviews and evaluations if applicable laws, rules and regulations are

being complied with; to insure that resources are being used in an

economical and efficient manner; that desired results are being

achieved effectively; to recognize merit and to seek ways and means

of constructively improving operations.

Program impacts have resulted in reductions in manpower and

equipment requests and other economies in our operations. It is not

possible to foresee program impacts for fiscal year 1977, but it can

be anticipated, based on past history, that economies in our oper-

ations will continue to be realized.

The program will be achieved through periodic inspections of each

field office, Headquarters division and foreign office. No program

alternatives have been considered.

The program is under constant evaluation throughout the FBI with a

view toward constructive improvement. Risks and uncertainties which

may affect the success of the program are budget constraints. No

coordination or joint planning with Department organizations or other

government agencies is necessary to assure success of the program.

No activities within the program are being terminated or curtailed

and no new program initiatives are planned for fiscal year 1977.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

Major outputs are inspection reports and summaries which are made

available to the Director through the Associate Director and to each

entity inspected.

Each pertinent Headquarters division is furnished

those portions of field inspection reports applicable to the particular

division for information and any action indicated. Inspection reports

have an impact on budget requests for manpower, equipment and

resources. The FBI itself is the direct client.

Program Justification:

Although not required by statute, the FBI has traditionally conducted

inspections to insure that investigative and administrative operations

are carried out properly. Federal Management Circular (FMC) 73-2

issued 9/27/73 by the General Services Administration required

FBI implementation which has been accomplished through internal

inspections.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

None.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

The most recent formal evaluation of this program was undertaken

by the Department's Office of Internal Audit in October, 1974, to

determine, among other things, whether our audits and inspections

were in compliance with GAO and GSA audit standards and to assess

the need for future internal audits of FBI activities. The evaluation

has been completed but a report of the results has not been received.

VI. A. 5. d. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to continue and build upon an effective

affirmative program for equal opportunity in employment and personnel

operations in the FBI without regard to race, color, religion, sex,

national origin or age and to provide an avenue through which complaints

of discrimination based on the foregoing factors filed by employees

or applicants for employment will be efficiently and effectively handled.

The nature of this program is such that there is no significant past or

planned impact on public problems. The effects of the affirmative

program for equal opportunity,however, are realized internally in the

effectiveness and dispatch with which certain investigations are con-

ducted.

Program impacts to date are wholly internal and, in terms of affirmative

programs, must be measured through an examination of progress in

minority recruitment. Such recruitment in the clerical area has been

excellent. Progress in attracting minority individuals for the Agent

position has been significantly less successful.

There are no program alternatives.

The risks and uncertainties which may affect the success of the pro-

gram are matters beyond this Bureau's control such as fiscal restraints

imposed by Congress and OMB and the availability of qualified individ-

uals from whom selection can be made. No programs or activities

concerned with equal opportunity are being terminated or curtailed and

there are no new program initiatives for fiscal year 1977.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

The program outputs are submissions of reports to the Director on

minority recruiting results and status of discrimination complaints,

similar reports to the Department of Justice, Equal Employment

Opportunity Plans of Action and reports on the Spanish Speaking and

Federal Women's Programs which programs are an integral part of

the overall equal opportunity effort. In the general sense, the client

served is the FBI itself.

166

IH 55299 DocId: 32989691 Page 274

---

## Page 275

Program Justification:

Justification for the Equal Employment Opportunity Program is set

forth in 5 CFR, Section 713, which contains the general program

provisions, and in Executive Order 11478 dated August 1969, Public

Law 92-261 and Department of Justice Order 1713.4.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

The FBI has set the maximum age limit for entry into the Special

Agent position at 35 years, based on the provisions of Public

Law 93-350, the retirement legislation applicable to Federal law

enforcement officers and firefighters, and is currently awaiting a

decision by the Civil Service Commission.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

The most recently completed formal evaluation of the Equal Employ-

ment Opportunity Program was conducted by the FBI's Inspection

Division which results are contained in that Division's report to the

Associate Director dated 11/1/74.

VI. B. 2. a. (1). MEDICAL SERVICES

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to (1) provide emergency attention or

treatment of illness or injuries; (2) referral of employees to private

physicians or hospitals when necessary; (3) initiate or work in con-

junction with other agencies in preventative programs relating to health

and safety, striving toward achieving maximum health and safe working

conditions for all FBI employees.

There is no direct impact on public problems but healthier employees

who are utilizing less sick leave hours serve to promote higher

morale thereby more efficiently and economically serving the public.

The program impacts to date have been a minimum of work-related

injuries and through the preventative health programs a savings in

untold hours of sick leave utilized by employees.

Program plans will be achieved through continued implementation of

existing medical facilities and developing in each employee a keen

awareness of the benefits derived in availing themselves of preventative

programs offered.

There does not appear to be any alternative program which might be

substituted for a program of this type. Budgetary curtailments are the

only risks and uncertainties which may affect the success of this

program.

This program's success is enhanced by almost daily coordination and

consultation with Public Health Service, Department of Jústice, Civil

Service Commission, and various government medical examining

facilities throughout the country. There are no programs being ter-

minated or curtailed nor new programs planned for fiscal year 1977.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

Program outputs are medical services provided for employees of the

FBI.

Program Justification:

Program is justified by Public Law 658 of the 79th Congress enacted

August 8, 1946.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

No known legislative changes are contemplated nor is any legislative

change required at this time.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

The FBI Inspection Staff examined the operations of the Health Service

Unit in October, 1974, and noted 124, 656 various health type services

were rendered to FBI employees during the previous year. It was

noted these services rendered effected a saving of employee's sick

leave and benefits the government by obviating absences.

VI. B. 2. a. (2). PERSONNEL

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to provide administrative support

to the FBI Headquarters, FBI field offices, and FBI Legal Attaches

through a centralized personnel management system operated by

the Personnel Section at FBI Headquarters. For the purpose of

this report, the term personnel includes all human resources

administrative functions with the exception of Office of Equal

Employment Opportunity Affairs, and the FBI Health Service. The

noted exceptions are being set forth separately.

This program essentially is responsive to the operational require-

ments of the FBI, and as such it has no direct impact on public

problems.

Bureau personnel program planning is achieved through coordination

with all divisions through Assistant Directors and Special Agents in

Charge to gather and analyze information related to anticipated

personnel matters.

The desired objectives of this program are to meet the human

resources needs of the FBI provided these needs are justified, and

fall within budget limitations. There are no alternatives for this

program.

Risks and uncertainties which could affect the success of the

personnel program would include fluctuations of the FBI's investi-

gative responsibilities caused by new legislation, major extensive

unanticipated investigations, or unanticipated budget limitations.

The FBI maintains Congressional liaison to stay abreast of pertinent

legislation and its possible effect on Bureau operations.

Similarly, coordination is maintained with the Department on

matters of mutual concern relating to personnel planning and

programs. Select contact is maintained with the Civil Service

Commission, Veterans Administration, and other government

agencies on personnel matters of interest. No program activities

are being terminated or curtailed and no new program initiatives

are planned for fiscal year 1977.

Major Program Output and Clients Served:

The program is internal in nature and serves the personnel needs

173

HH 55299

DocId: 32989691 Page 281

---

## Page 282

of the FBI. Its purpose is to provide direction and monitor

personnel matters such as recruiting, placement, all forms of

compensation, work assignment, grade classification, and all

related administrative functions through separation and/or

retirement.

Program Justification:

The fundamental authority for the activities of the FBI is contained

in Chapter 33, Title 28, U. S. Code: 28 CFR 0. 137 authorizes the

Director of the FBI to exercise the power and authority vested in

the Attorney General by law to take final action in matters pertaining

to the employment, direction, and general administration of FBI

personnel. (Except the positions of Associate Director, Assistant

to the Director, and Assistant Director.)

Legislation Affecting the Program:

HR 550, a bill concerning the confidentiality of financial records,

if enacted, would require the FBI to obtain an additional release

from applicants for employment so that financial records of the

applicant could be reviewed.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

The most recently completed formal evaluation of the personnel

program function was conducted by the FBI's Inspection Division.

Results of this evaluation are contained in that Division's report

dated 11/1/74, to the Associate Director.

VI. B. 2. b. (1). PROCUREMENT, SUPPLY AND

CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to supply the needs of the FBI as

effectively as possible with supplies and/or equipment and also con-

tracting when necessary. There are no fiscal year 1977 planned im-

pacts on public problems addressed by the program since this is a

service function. The program impact to date cannot be measured in

quantity terms.

The program plans will be effected by ascertaining the needs of the

Headquarters and field divisions and fulfilling these needs abiding by

all existing Government regulations.

There are no program alternatives which have been considered since

this is a support operation and there is no justification for the selection

of any program alternative. The only risks and constraints which may

affect the success of this program would be budgetary constraints.

Coordination is necessary with the Department of Justice, General

Services Administration, Government Printing Office, and the General

Accounting Office, since procurements are handled in accordance with

the Code of Federal Regulations, Federal Procurement Regulations,

Federal Register, Federal Property Management Regulations, Federal

Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, Decisions of the

Comptroller General, Department of Justice Memorandum No. 750

dated May 7, 1971, Presidential Executive Orders, General Accounting

Office Manuals, etc.

There are no programs or activities which will be terminated or cur-

tailed and there are no program initiatives planned for fiscal year 1977

since existing rules and regulations must be complied with in performing

these operations.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

Our major program outputs are the services, supplies and equipment

furnished to Headquarters and field divisions which are the clients

served.

VI. B. 2. b. (4). PRINTING SERVICES AND SPACE MAINTENANCE

Program Description:

This program is responsible for designing, preparation, printing or

reproduction of charts, graphs, flyers, instructional and policy mater-

ial, and other items relating to investigative and administrative FBI

operations, in addition to the eificient management of space. Much of

the information and material processed is of delicate and confidential

nature which precludes releasing to commercial or outside concerns

for processing. The efficient management of space is essential to pro-

vide adequate but not excessive facilities for the various FBI Headquarters

and field operations.

The nature of this program itself is such that there are no significant

past or planned direct impacts on public problems; however, the effects

of this activity are realized in the other program activities which di-

rectly impact on public problems. Program goals are achieved by

responding as requested for authorized services and providing for neces-

sary space.

There is a degree of coordination and joint planning with the Govern-

ment Printing Office through the Department of Justice concerning

printing matters not performed as a part of this program activity.

Space matters are coordinated with the General Services Administra-

tion.

The only apparent risks and uncertainties are those relative to budget-

ary constraints.

No program activities are being terminated or curtailed and no new

initiatives are planned.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

The program outputs are the finished materials and adequate space

necessary to the investigative and administrative FBI operations. The

printing and space management functions are internal in nature and serve

the operational activities of the FBI both at Headquarters and in the field.

Program Justification:

Effective June 30, 1974, the Joint Committee on Printing approved the

operation of the FBl printing operation as a satellite of the Department

of Justice Publication Services Facility. The justification for space

maintenance is inherent in the basic statutory authority for the FBI,

Chapter 30 of Title 28, United States Code.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

No legislative changes are required.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

The most recent evaluation of the printing function was conducted in

the submission of the annual report to Joint Committee on Printing by

the Department which incorporated the results of the FBI printing

program. The entire program is subject to continuous evaluation by

the FBI's Inspection Division both at FBI Headquarters and throughout

its field offices.

VI. B. 2. c. SYSTEMS SUPPORT

Program Description:

Administrative systems support services are provided by the FBI's

Data Processing Section (DPS). The purpose of these support services

is to provide FBI management all pertinent information accurately, in

a logical fashion and on a timely basis to enable sound managerial

decisions. Systems support for administrative services covers such

functions as personnel, payroll. accounting, budgets, training, inves-

tigative accomplishments, statistics, and mailing lists.

No public problems are directly addressed by the DPS systems

support program for administrative services.

Program plans are achieved by responding to the needs for this service.

The systems support programs are all "on-going" systems. They were

started when the FBI first acquired its computers and the plan is to con-

tinue them in the future. To date, systems support programs have

accomplished their objectives.

No program alternatives have been considered.

There are no risks or uncertainties involved that would materially

affect the administrative systems support provided by the DPS, notwith-

standing budgetary constraints.

Very little coordination with other

Department organizations or government agencies is required for the

support systems.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

The major output of the administrative systems support program is in

the form of computer produced reports, tabulations or computer gen-

erated messages on Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) terminals. All FBI

Divisions and field offices are served by the DPS systems support

programs.

Program Justification:

The system support programs originated internally and have all been

approved by FBI management. The systems support provided through

the computer could not possibly be obtained as economically, as

efficiently, or as timely on a manual basis.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

The DPS constantly explores new methods and equipment to better

accomplish systems support objectives. The most recently completed

formal evaluation of the DPS's system support program was conducted

by the FBI's Inspection Division, the results of which are contained in

that Division's report dated April 26, 1974.

VI. B. 2. d. STANDARD LEVEL USERS CHARGE (SLUC)

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to review, verify, challenge, resolve

and approve the charges (SLUC) levied by the General Services Admin-

istration (GSA) for space and services provided for the FBI. This

program is administered from FBI Headquarters as a component of

the space management function whose objective is the maximum and

efficient utilization of space occupied by the FBI.

The program has no significant impact upon public problems; however,

it does affect other FBI programs which do have an impact upon public

problems.

This is an on-going, field-wide program which is centrally coordinated

with the assistance of the Assistant Directors of FBI Headquarters

divisions and the Special Agents in Charge of the field offices. There

are no alternative programs which would accomplish the objectives of

this program on a timely basis.

The administration of the SLUC program is subject to procedures and

guidelines promulgated by GSA. Since the SLUC system became

effective at the beginning of the 1975 fiscal year, changes can be

expected for several years until efficient procedures can be firmed up.

Other Government organizations dealt with in connection with the SLUC

program mainly include the Department of Justice and local, regional

and Headquarters levels of GSA. No significant new program initia-

tives are planned for the 1977 fiscal year.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

The resolution and approval of the four quarterly billings and adjust-

ments thereto for the some 575 locations throughout the country occu-

pied by the FBI are the principal outputs of this program.

Program Justification and Legislation Affecting the Program:

The SLUC program implements the applicable provisions of the Public

Buildings Amendments of 1972 (Public Law 92-313). Regulations

governing SLUC are set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations,

Title 41, Chapter 101, Part 101-21. No legislative changes are anti-

cipated.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

The SLUC program was implemented on July 1, 1974. An evaluation

of the program within the FBI was made by the Inspection Division

during the annual inspection of the Administrative Division, the results of

which were reported to the Associate Director, November

• 1, 1974.

ASSESSMENT OF ALTERNATIVE FUNDING LEVELS

If the FBI were to receive a fiscal year 1977 dollar resource allocation

which is ten percent greater than the fiscal year 1976 Congressional Bud-

get dollar level, the increase would be accomplished in substantially the

same proportion as the increases are being requested for the fiscal year

1977.

The increase would help to alleviate some of the work delinquencies

now being experienced if programs were to be maintained at the present

levels. It would not provide for any new program initiatives.

If the FBI were to receive a fiscal year 1977 dollar allowance of ten

percent less than the fiscal year 1976 Congressional Budget dollar level,

it would have a devastating effect on the Bureau's operations. Such a

reduction could only be accomplished by reducing the level of personnel,

which is already much too low for an efficient operation, inasmuch as

almost 90 percent of the FBI's funds are devoted to personnel cost and

such fixed costs as rent, communications and utilities.

## Page 299

DOJ comment 6., 6/3/75: There is no substantive discussion of the

impact of a ten percent reduction in the FY77 allocation.

As set forth on page 190, a ten percent reduction in the fiscal year

1977 dollar allowance would have a devastating effect on the FBI's

operations. There is no single program, activity or type of expense

in which such a reduction could be absorbed and it would therefore

have to be on the basis of an across-the-board reduction. Almost

90 percent of the FBI's funds are devoted to personnel costs and

such fixed costs as rents, communications and utilities. There is

no way

such a reduction could be taken without further reducing the

level of personnel which was reduced for fiscal year 1976 to the point

of adversely affecting the FBI's efficient operation. The amount

representing the ten percent in excess of the personnel and fixed costs

includes such items as laboratory equipment, field investigative

equipment, costs of various automation efforts and other necessary

support costs. We have been forced year after year to absorb within

this small area of funding any increases in operating costs which

were not specifically caused by statute. Because of the spiraling infla-

tion in recent years particularly, we have had to defer normal equip-

ment replacement and forego the modernization of equipment in order

to pay the increased costs.

We simply cannot continue to do this and

expect to remain a viable and effective law enforcement agency.

be comprised of the following:

1976

Request

Transition

Period

Restoration of the $5.3 million cut

from the 1976 fiscal year request

due to the then pending rescission

of 1975 funds. PL94-14 cancelled

the 1975 pending rescission.

Increased cost of Government's

contributions to Federal Employees'

Group Life Insurance from 13.75

to 17.75 cents per thousand per bi-

weekly pay period effective first

pay period after February 28, 1975.

Increased utility costs at the FBI

Academy

Increase in workload under Freedom

of Information Act requires additional

employees (11 agents 94 clerks) and

funding therefor

$5,300, 000

313,000

1, 500, 000

$1,345,400

78,000

61, 500

366, 100

Supplementals:

No supplementals have been requested thus far. Supplemental funds will,

however, be needed to pay for the pay increase for General Schedule

employees. Request for such funds will be submitted at the appropriate

time as will requests for additional funds which might be required as the

result of future legislation.

I. A. 9. INTERNAL SECURITY

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to identify organizations and individ-

uals engaged in activities relating to (1) subversion, overthrow and

destruction of governments within the United States; (2) the depriva-

tion of constitutional and civil rights, in order to detect whether or

not their activities involve violations of Federal statutes; (3) and

foreign terrorism and supporters of same which activity would be

detrimental to the conduct of foreign affairs.

The planned fiscal year 1977's impact on public problems is not

quantitatively measurable; however, the problems addressed by the

program involved the curtailment of subversion, alleviation of depri-

vation of civil rights and the lowering of instances of violence.

The program impact to date is similarly not measurable in a quantita-

tive sense; however, the program is believed to have had a mitigating

effect on subversion, violence, and the deprivation of rights, result-

ing in a measure of domestic tranquility and a reduction in international

terrorism and the lowering of instances of violence.

Efforts employed to accomplish this program include active investiga-

tion to identify organizations and individuals whose aims and purposes

and overt acts are in furtherance of activities to overthrow and/or

destroy governments within the United States, deprive citizens of

their constitutional or civil rights and to target such organizations

and individuals for investigative attention including those individuals

and organizations engaged in terrorist activities detrimental to the

conduct of foreign affairs.

There are no program alternatives since our responsibilities are man-

dated by statutory requirements.

The risk and uncertainties which may affect the success of this pro-

gram are involved in budget limitations, limiting of resources of

manpower and material and adverse legislation.

The amount of coordination necessary involves close and continual

liaison with other Department organizations as well as other govern-

ment agencies including membership on various intelligence commun-

ity committees.

SECKET

No major programs or activities are being terminated or curtailed

nor are there any new program initiatives planned for fiscal year

1977 other than the continuation and maintenance of the on-going pro-

gram to accomplish our objectives.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

The course of action undertaken to fulfill these responsibilities is

necessary since there is no other branch of the Government charged

with these responsibilities. The success of these undertakings lies in

the aggressive fulfillment of our objectives as set forth above. These

responsibilities include appropriate dissemination of information

developed to appropriate Government agencies in the Executive Branch,

as required by Executive Order and officially approved agreements

with those agencies.

To combat the widespread use of false identification commonly employed.

by those engaged in revolutionary and terrorist tactics in this country,

the FBI was a motivating force which led to the recent establishment by

the Department of the Federal Advisory Committee of False Identifica-

tion. Purpose of this Committee is to determine the full scope of the

false identification problems and to recommend methods to resolve

these problems, which would be of assistance in many areas of Fed-

veral, state and local government operations. Additionally, in the field

of terrorism the FBI is a member of the Cabinet Committee to Combat

Terrorism which was established by the President and chaired by the

Secretary of State. In this field the FBI cooperates with foreign intelli-

gence agencies as terrorism is an international problem.

Program Justification:

The fundamental authority for internal security investigations is derived

from various Federal statutes including rebellion and insurrection

(Title 18 U.S. Code Section 2383), seditious conspiracy (Title 18 U.S.

Code Section 2384), advocating the overthrow of the Government

(Title 18 U.S. Code Section 2385), civil rights (Title 18 U.S. Code

Section 241), and other statutes involving riots, civil disorders, pro-

tection of foreign officials and official guests, and possession and use

of illegal explosives and incendiary devices.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

There is currently under study by a number of congressional commit-

tees the intelligence gathering activities of the FBI which could lead to

new legislation affecting our overall responsibilities in these areas.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

The most recent formal evaluation of on-going programs in this area

was conducted by the FBI's Inspection Division between the dates

3/11/75 - 4/4/75 which will be contained in the Inspection Division's

report to the Associate Director. All on-going programs in thes

areas are reevaluated on a continual basis to assure that we ar

adequately fulfilling our responsibilities in these areas and that our

investigations are being conducted in strict adherence to all guide -

lines governing such investigations.

I. A. 10. COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

Program Description:

The purpose of this program is to conduct investigations to

counter intelligence operations of hostile foreign intelligence

services within the United States. Efforts employed to accomplish

program objectives include (1) training to upgrade personnel in

counterintelligence expertise; (2) analysis and correlation of

information developed to identify foreign intelligence officers and/or

agents dispatched to the United States under legal or illegal cover;

(3) neutralization of overt and covert intelligence gathering activities

targeted against the United States through disinformation,

controlled

double agent operations, exposure of unwitting sources of information,

and arrest and prosecution of witting agents; (4) penetration of

foreign intelligence services through recruitment of their personnel

and compromise of their communication channels.

Program impacts to date cannot be quantitatively measured; however,

the accomplishment of objectives has contributed to the internal

security of the United States and the conduct of foreign policy.

Planned fiscal year 1977 impacts on public problems likewise cannot be

quantitatively measured, although national foreign policy initiatives

in regard to increased contacts with foreign governments can be

expected to result in a concomitant increase in the presence of

hostile foreign intelligence personnel in the United States.

The course of action undertaken to accomplish objectives is necessary

and there are no alternatives, since no other branch of the United

States Government has been mandated these specific responsibilities

and statutory imperatives. The continuing nature of the program

does not lend itself to termination and/or curtailment of techniques

utilized, and the existing program will be continued in fiscal year 1977.

Daily liaison is maintained with other government agencies to insure

prompt receipt and dissemination of information vital to the program.

While primarily national in scope, the operating environment may

be international on occasion and therefore coordination and planning

is sometimes effected with friendly foreign intelligence services.

SECRET

The success of this program is largely dependent upon the support

and cooperation of the general public. Adverse legislation as well

as budgetary and statutory limitations on resources are inherent

risks and uncertainties that can have a negative affect on this

program.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

The program outputs are the timely and pertinent disseminations

of information developed to appropriate Government agencies in

the Executive Branch and friendly foreign intelligence services.

In the field of counterintelligence the FBI is a member of the U. S.

Intelligence Board and other inter-agency committees addressing

problems or questions affecting the internal security of the United

States.

Program Justification:

The jurisdiction and authority in counterespionage, or the broader

term of counterintelligence, is based on Presidential Directives

and statutes, e.g., Espionage 18 U.S.C. 792-799 and 783; Atomic

Energy Act, 42 U.S.C. 2077, 2122, 2131, 2138, 2165, 2274-2278B;

Registration Acts, 18 U.S.C. 951, 22 U.S. C. 611-621, 50 U.S.C.

851-858, 18 U.S.C. 2386; Sabotage, 18 U.S.C. 2152-2156, 50

U.S. C. 797; Sedition, 18 U.S.C. 2387-2390; Treason, 18 U.S.C.

2381, 2382.

Surveillance of foreign intelligence personnel to monitor their

activities is generally provided for by 28 U.S. C. 533, which

authorizes the Attorney General to investigate matters of interest

to the Department of State; is conducted under the inherent power

of the Government to protect itself against foreign powers; and is

conducted to determine if any foreign intelligence activities are in

violation of the above statutes.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

There is currently under study by a number of various congressional

committees the intelligence gathering activities of the FBI which

could lead to new legislation affecting our overall responsibilities

in these areas.

W. Raymond Wannall, Assistant Director

Program Objective Resource Requirements:

Counterintelligence:

Man-Years -

Total Dollars (in thousands) -

Intelligence - Counterintelligence: Man-Years -

Total Dollars (in thousands) -

Program Objective Description:

Conduct investigations to identify, neutralize, disrupt and penetrate

hostile operations of foreign intelligence services. Conduct training

to upgrade, as yet to be determined, personnel in counterintelligence

expertise.

Analyze and correlate information developed to insure the

exploitation of targets of opportunity.

Maintain close liaison with United States and friendly foreign intelligence

services to insure receipt of information vital to the program objective.

While primarily national in scope, on occasion the operating environment

may be international..

In connection with testimony in support of FBI Budget for fiscal year

1976, Director Clarence M. Kelley specifically cited the increasing

numbers of Soviet-bloc officials present in the U. S. which offer additional

opportunity for clandestine intelligence collection. Recently established

diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC) add to this

potential.

## Page 321

In 1960 there were 588 Soviet-bloc officials in the United States; in

1970 this presence had increased to 1, 129 and by 3/31/75 there were

1, 948 Soviet-bloc officials assigned at diplomatic establishments of

those countries in the United States. FBI investigative experience has

consistently shown that 35 - 40 percent of Soviet-bloc officials have

intelligence assignments. Defector sources and friendly foreign intelli-

gence services have advised that on occasion this number may be as

high as 75 - 80 percent of the total complement.

For the first three quarters of fiscal year 1975, over 7, 000 Soviet-bloc

nationals visited the United States under exchange agreements or for

commercial purposes. Director Kelley is assigning additional personnel

to counterintelligence operations, as the need arises, as a means of

insuring program objective.

Key Milestones:

December, 1976

(1) Endeavor to identify, neutralize, disrupt and penetrate hostile opera-

tions of foreign intelligence services to maximum degree possible.

(2) Complete the training of agents, number as yet to be determined,

in specialized fields of counterintelligence work.

(3) Analyze and correlate information developed to insure maximum

exploitation.

(4) Continue close liaison with United States and friendly foreign intelli-

gence services.

January, 1977

Complete annual review, correlation and analysis of the hostile opera-

tions of foreign intelligence services and FBI counterintelligence investi-

gations to detect trends and new developments for operational and train-

ing purposes.

June, 1977

I. A. 11. b. INTELLIGENCE - INTERNAL SECURITY

Program Description:

The purpose of operation of informants under this program is to iden-

tify organizations and individuals engaged in (1) subversion, over-

throw and destruction of governments within the United States; (2) the

deprivation of constitutional and civil rights, in order to detect whether

or not their activities involve violations of Federal statutes; (3) and

foreign terrorism and supporters of same which activity would be

detrimental to the conduct of foreign affairs.

The planned fiscal year 1977's impact on public problems is not quan-

titatively measurable; however, it is anticipated the utilization of

informants for purposes stated above will significantly curtail acts of

subversion, alleviate deprivation of civil rights and eliminate acts of

foreign terrorism in this country.

The program impact to date is similarly not measurable in a quantita-

tive sense; however, the operation of informants under this program

is believed to have had a mitigating effect on subversion, deprivation

of civil rights and acts of foreign terrorism detrimental to this coun- .:

try's conduct of foreign affairs, and has resulted in a measure of

domestic tranquility and a lessening of instances of violence.

Efforts employed to accomplish program objectives through the opera-

tion of informants include their targeting against individuals and organ-

izations whose aims, purposes and overt acts are in furtherance of

activities outlined above.

Extensive consideration has been afforded alternatives, other than use

of informants, as a means of accomplishing goals stated above, in-

cluding the need for additional investigative manpower and increased

use of physical surveillances. Additionally, consideration has been

given to new legislation which would increase investigative techniques

currently available to the FBI.

HH 55299

Utilization of informants to accomplish program objectives is justified

as thorough study has determined that utilization of carefully selected

informants is the most certain and quickest means of achieving pro-

gram goals, as well as being, in the long run, the least expensive

means available.

Risks and uncertainties in use of informants are not unique to this

program, but are common to all investigations where this technique is

utilized.

Beside the obvious danger of physical harm befalling the

informant should he be compromised, the FBI also encounters the

risks of informant furnishing false or misleading information, budget-

ary limitations and adverse legislation.

Unless a specific need arises, the FBI handles informants used in this

program on a strict need to know basis, both within the Bureau itself.

as well as with other government agencies. When the need arises for

coordination of informant operation, channels do exist between involved

agencies to accomplish this end. Informant information received of

interest to other government agencies is, as a matter of policy,

promptly disseminated to the interested agencies.

No programs or activities affecting the use of informants under this

program are being curtailed or eliminated.

No new program initiatives affecting the use of informants under this

program are currently planned for fiscal year 1977. This Bureau's

informant program is under continual evaluation, and necessary changes

or implementations are promptly initiated as the occasion arises.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

The course of action undertaken to fulfill these responsibilities is

necessary since there is no other branch of Government charged with

these responsibilities.

The success of these undertakings lays in the

aggressive fulfillment of our objectives as set forth above. These

responsibilities include appropriate dissemination of information devel-

oped to appropriate Government agencies in the Executive Branch, as

required by Executive Order and officially approved agreements with

those agencies.

Program Justification:

The fundamental authority for internal security investigation accom-

plished through the use of informants is derived from various Federal

statutes including rebellion and insurrection (Title 18 U.S. Code Sec-

tion 2383), seditious conspiracy (Title 18 U.S. Code Section 2384),

advocating the overthrow of the Government (Title 18 U.S. Code Sec-

tion 2385); civil rights (Title 18 U.S. Code Section 241), and other

statutes involving riots, civil disorders, protection of foreign officials

and official guests, and possession and use of illegal explosives and

incendiary devices.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

There is currently under study by a number of congressional com-

mittees the intelligence gathering activities of the FBI which could

lead to new legislation affecting our overall responsibilities in these

areas.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

The most recent formal evaluation of on-going programs in this area

was conducted by the FBI's Inspection Division between the dates

3/11/75 - 4/4/75 which will be contained in the Inspection Division's

report to the Associate Director. All ongoing programs in these areas

are re-evaluated on a continual basis to assure that we are adequately

fulfilling our responsibilities in these areas and that our investigations

are being conducted in strict adherence to all guidelines governing

such investigations.

Government.

There are no programs or activities within the above program which are

being curtailed or terminated and no new programs are being planned for

fiscal year 1977.

Major Program Outputs and Clients Served:

The course of action undertaken to fulfill the above-mentioned program is

necessary since no other branch of the United States Government 1s charged

with these specific responsibilities. All pertinent information developed

is disseminated on a timely basis to other appropriate Governmental

agencies and in some instances to friendly foreign intelligence services.

The FBI further fulfills its intelligence disseminating responsibilities

through its membership on the United States Intelligence Board and other

inter-agency committees.

Program Justification:

The jurisdication and authority for counterintelligence investigations,

accomplished through the use of assets, is derived from various Federal

statutes including Espionage 18 U.S. C. 792-799 and 783; Atomic Energy

Act, 42 U.S.C. 2077, 2122, 2131, 2138, 2165, 2274-2278B; Registration

2387-2390; Treason, 18 U.S.C. 2381, 2382, and Presidential Directives.

Legislation Affecting the Program:

There is currently under study by a number of various congressional

committees the intelligence gathering activities of the FBI which could

lead to new legislation affecting our overall responsibilities in these areas.

Evaluation of On-going Programs:

The most recent formal evaluation of on-gang programs in counterintelligence

and counterespionage was conducted by the FBI's Inspection Division

between the dates 3/11/75 - 4/4/75, the results of which will be contained

in the Inspection Division's report to the Associate Director. All

on going programs in these areas are reevaluated on a continual basis to

assure that responsibilities are adequately fulfilled and investigations

are conducted in strict adherence to all governing guidelines.

PRIORITY RANKING OF PROGRAMS

Category VI "Organization Program Direction" has not been

prioritized as it is from this category that the operational

programs have received their rankings. The latter cannot

exist without the former.

Categories I and IV have been considered where like activities

exist as that activity must be considered as one effort. To

illustrate, categories I. A. 12. c. "Fingerprint Identification"

has been merged with IV. A. 3. e. "Fingerprint Identification."

Similarly, I. A. 11. a. (1). "Intelligence-Organized Crime"

has been added to I. A. 3. "Organized Crime" and so on.

At a meeting held by Associate Director Nicholas P. Callahan with

the Assistants to the Director and all Assistant Directors, a full

discussion was had as to the priority rankings of FBI programs and

program objectives. It was unanimously agreed that programs and

objectives would be ranked in accordance with the level of funding

being committed to each program. These priorities will be subject

to change as the year progresses inasmuch as the FBI is responsive

to changing conditions and in accordance with existing needs must re-

order its priorities. The resultant activities are prioritized as follows:
