accention

upon receipt of AIRGRAl no. 1301, dated 31 October 1959, froz the

United States Embassy in Moscow, in which it was stated cha:

OSIVAL had appeared at the Enbassy on 31 Octover to renounce his

American citizenship. He stated that he had applied in "loscow

for Soviet citisenship after his arrival in the Soviet Union on

15 October. The first public reference to OSVALD appeared in the

Nashington Post of 1 Yovenber 1959.

On 2 November 1959, the FBI liaison officer requestedfa...

trace be, run on Lee Harvey OSALD in the teepes central hold-

a response on 4 November was negative.

Because of the counterintelligence implications of

OSWALD's action, the Counter Intelligence Staff opened an offi-

cial file on Lee Harvey OSWALD to acconmodate biographic infor-

mation developed by the Agency in response to a Department of

State inquiry, dated 25 October 1960, on a list of American de-

fectors in Soviet Bloc countries. OSWALD's name was one of those

appearing on the list. CIA forwarded an interim reply on 3

November 1960; a final reply on 21 November 1960. Until early

October 1963, the contents of the OSWALD file held by CIA consis-

ted entirely of press clippings and'reports disseminated by the

Department of State, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the:

Departnent of the Vavy.

on S October 1963, the CIA Station in Mexico City Perved

can named Lee OSWALD had contacted the Soviet Embassy in Vexico

City on Tuesday, 1 October 1963. He had spoken in halting Russ.

sian to the Soviet Embassy guard, Ivan Ivanovich OBYEDKOV, to...

whon he said he had visited the Embassy two days earlier, .on..

Saturday, 23 September. He asked whether there had been a reply

to a telegram that the Consuln with whon he had spoken, but whose

sane he could not recall, had promised to send to washington.

From this revier by the Station it became evident that osvalD

had also visited. the cuban Consulate in Mexico City and had talked

thero with a clerk, a Mexican national, named Silvia DURAy. Aster

the assassination and tho publicity about bos OSNALd, silvia DURAX

OSWALD about a Cuban visa.

Silvia DURAN and her husband, Horacio.

DURAY Navarro, were detäined and questioned by the Mexican police

from 23 to 25 November 1963.

- After giving some of the details of her own personal back-

ground - she was an admitted leftist sympathizer and had formerly

worked for the Mexican-Cuban Institute of Cultural Relations - Sil-

via_DURAN said that when she first heard of the death of. President /

Kennedy she had been depressed and thought-the assassin must have

been a maniac: When she learned he was associated with the "Talt

from the description of OSWALD, she was sure It was the sano man.

OSVALD was denied a Cuban transit visa because he did not yet have

a Soviet visa, and he was told to get the soviet visa first, but it

iwas nored that this, would require about four sonths. She had asked

the Cuban Consul himself, Euscbio AZCUE, I0 calk to OSWALD and. Ehey

had an argument when AZCUE urged OSWALD to. leave Mexico Instead of

the Cuban Consulate could grant hia a visa and arrange

inmizration details if the concession of a Soviet visa were

assured.

b. 2i Septenber. Pursuant to her inquiry, Silvia DURAN

received a confirmation from the Soviet Embassy that the

American had been to the USSR installation. He had shown

them a letter from the Soviet Consulate in lashing:on indi

cating that he had been long awaiting a visa for himself

and his wife to go to the USSR.. No answer had come frow

Washington; however, the waiting period was sometimes four

or five months. The American also had a letter attesting.

that he was a member of a pro-Cuban organization but he had;

claimed that the Cubans would not give him a visa unless he

had already received a Russian visa. -

Although the American was still at the Cuban Consulate:

Silvia DURAN repeated that she could not give hima transit

visa unless a Soviet visa was forthconing, notwithstanding

the American's wish to go to Cuba to wait there for his

Soviet visa. According to DURAN, the American knew no one

in Cuba and she intended to make an appropriate annotation

on the American's card. The Sovirt official echoed her

statement that the American was not known.

c. 28 September. Silvia DURAN vas again visited at

the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City by the Anerican seeking a

Cuban transit visa. Mrs. DURAN contacted at least two men-

bers of the Soviet Enbassy and facilitated a direct con-

versation between one of the Soviets and the American.

Speaking in poor Russian, the American stated that he al?:

ready had been to the Soviet Consulate and had left an ad-

dress. The Soviet official replied that he was aware of

that. The American suggested that he had nöt known his

address then, and he had gone to the Cuban Embassy to ask

for the address, because they had it. The American them

Comment:

It is believed that the Soviet official with whom OSWALD

dealt in Mexico City was Consular Attache Valeriy Vladimirovich

KOSTIROV, born in Moscow, 17 March 1933e

In his letter of 9 November 1963 I0 the soviet Consulate

in Hashingron, OSYALD wrote about "his neetings wich Comrado KOSTIV

"KOSTIN", other than COnsul XOSTIXOY.

KOSTIKOV wIs the Sentor officer of five Soviet Consular

Tepresentatives who dealt with visas and related matters. There

is firm evidence for the conclusion that KOSTIKOV is a Soviet State

Security (KGB) officer, and the other four Consular officers were

also known or strongly suspected to be Soviet State Security

parsonnel serving under official cover.

It must be clearly stated that Soviet intelligence and

security officers placed abroad under official cover normally are

required to perform the routine and legitimate business demanded by.

the cover job in an embassy or consulate.

KOSTIKOV was first spotted as a KGB nan because of his

travels around Mexico, his habitual association wita known KGB

A close observation was maintained on the Soviet personnel,

or out-of-pattern was noted in the activity or movements of the

Soviet personnel.

remarks vere attributed to YATSKOY in Mexico City regarding Lee.

He threatened that Cuba would answer in kind."

(V. 3]

On Saturday evening, I Septenber 1963, Fidel CASTRO ap-

peared at a Brazilian Embassy reception in Havana; even more un-

usual, CASTRO submitted

,to an informal interview by the Associated

Press correspondent, Daniel HARKER.

HARKER's interview reached New York on Sunday, 8 Septem:

ber, and was in print throughout the country on Monday, 9 Septem-

ber. There can be no guestion from the facts surrounding the

CASTRO appearance, which had not been expected, and his agreemont

to the intertier, that this event represented a mere-than ordinary

attempt to get a message on the record in the United States.

_CISTRO's statements to HARKER covered a rango of roptes

but dealt prineipally with American political leadership, in parta:

cular President KENNEDY, whoa he excoriated in extraordinarily pro-

vocative fasition.

The interview also contained an uncomplimentary reference

to Senator GOLDWATER and Cuban delay in signing the limited nuclear

test ban.

There were differences in the replay by United States

newspapers like the New York Tires and Nashington papers, with a

result that CATSRO's "message" was significantly modulated.

In New Orleans, where Lee Harvey OSWALD resided until the

middle of September 1963, the HARKER story appeared in the principal

morning paper, the Times-Picayune, on Monday, 9 September, page I,

under a three-column headline: "CASTRO 3lasts Raids on Cuba. Says

Leaders Imperiled by Aid to Rebels". The story followed under the

HARKER by-line:

"Havana (AP) = Rrime Minister Fidel CASTRO

said Saturday night: 'U.S. leaders would be in

danger if they helped in any accept to do away

with leaders of Cuba'.

"Bitterly denouncing that he called rêcent

The New York Times, in its coverage on 9 September, used

a UPI Wire service report which omitted any reference to the warning:

and threat which gave the interview its real significance. The

Washingion Post did an abbreviated rewrite (D September, page A7)

which, sinilarly, onitted any reforence to the main thrust of

_GAStRo's remarks, The Evening Star of-Hashington, D. C., printed

There is no evidence in the files on the KEYNEDY assassi-

leads or in dealings with the Warren Commission and its staff al-

though Mexico Station specifically directed Headquarters attention

to the AP Story very shortly after the Dallas killing. Nore impor

by any other Cuban leader before the assassination.

CASTRO's warning and threat of 7 September 1963 - if

OSWALD did indeed read it in New Orleans - must be considered of

great significance in the light of the páthological evolution of

back as his Marine Corps service in El Toro, California. CASTRO's

warning and threate given to AP correspondent HARKER, irrespective
