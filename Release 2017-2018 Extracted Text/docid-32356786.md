CPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

This report will cover the period 3U July 190g through

15 Septenber 1963 and is a follow up report to reference 1.

EFFORTS TO LEGALLY EXFILTRATE AMLEO-3 FAMILY FIO CUBA

Since transmission of reference A to Headquarters several

developments occurred which effectively eliminated several alternate

solutions to the problem of the AlLEQ-3 family in Cuba.

alternate solutions that were eliminated, as found in paragraph

§ of reference A, were (a) "Haintaia Status QuO as a Family

attempting Leave

Cuba via Offices of Swiss Embassy as Part of the

American Repatriation Program"; (b) "Have AMIüO-3 Family

Withdraw Papers Fron the Swiss Embassy and American Repatriation

Program anú Attempt Leave Cuba as Nornal Refugees via Mexico

Or Spain"; and (e) "Have the AMLEQ3 Family Case Taken up With the

GOC Through the

'Donovan' Channel for Possible Legal Exfiltration".

Elimination of the above alternates left only tro solutions

that were at all feasible; (c) "Have the AMÆO-3 Family Take

Asylum in either the Uruguayan or Mestan Embassles in Havana"

or (d) "Have the AMLEO-3 Fanily Exfiltrated black in a Maritime

Operation by either a XUBARK or Independent Maritime Team."

Because of the inherent risk involved in a black exfiltration,

it was decided that the AMLEO-3 family should be put into

asylum in either the Uruguayan or Mexican embassies with all

possible speed.

To this end steps were initlated in on 24 July 1963

to put the 11Ls03 fauily and AMid? into asylum 1a the Mexican

Embassy in lavana.

The AXLEO-3 landly and AlLEO? were advised

via the AMVEE-1 OWVl channel on 4 August 1963 to prepare

themselves for asylum and to await further orders via the same

channel.

RUBARK Station in Mexico City, meanwhile, took urgent

action through its Mexican liaison' channels to have the Mexican

Foreiga Ministry obtain visas for the AMLEQ-3 family and

AJLEQ2; and then send vord to the Mexican Enbassy in Havana,

Cuba that the 1LEO-3 fanlly and AMLEO? should be granted asylum

whon they appeared at the Hexican Consulate under cover of

ObtaIning

their visas.

The visa portion of the operation was

satiafactarily completed and notification of same was sent into

the Mexican Embassy in Havana; but word re asylum for the

AHLEQ3 Lamily and AlLED? was not sent to the lexican embassy

due to luisecure como channels and lack of trusted couriers,

and

to date no secure method has yet been found to notify the Mexican

Embassy in Havana that asylun should be granted to the alleos.

As a/result of the above, word was sent to disa-

vIa OWVL on 11 September requesting he dotemine whether or not

Identity A vould to willing to act as internediary to recalve

the AMLEO 3 family and AlLEQ? into asylum at a specific time

and date at the Hesican consulate. AMVEE-l asked for

clarification on the manner of approaching Identity A on the case

on 13 September via pouch, and more detailed guidance on the

matter was sent to bin via OWVl, on 14 September. A final reply

re posalbilities for action via this channel 1a expected frou

ANWER-1 nomentarily.

If the AllEE-l reply 1a favorablo, then

he will be told to arrange the meeting at the Mexican consulate

between the AllEOs and Identity A so that they can be taken into

asylun by the Mexicans.

As noted In reference 3, if the Aniall report is a

negative one, then consideration

w111 be given to having the

AMLEOs take asylun in the Uruguayan Embassy 1n Havana.

1f this attempt at asylum is successiul then arrangements will

As noted in paragraph 1 of reference B, the wife

Of ANLEO-3 finally made a direct contact with AATHUG-1 on 7

September 1963, while he was at his Santa laria beach house,

and appealed too bin for permlasion to leave Cuba with her

childres and rejoin her husband AMutO-3 in the Unlted States..

On 14 September 1963 AMLEQ-3 recelved a lotter frow his wife

giving more details on the above meeting.

The wife of AMLEO-3

had been visiting the beach home of a fantly Irlend, situated

next to that of AUTHUG-l on Santa Marla beach, on a

daily bagis

hoping to see AuTHUG 1.

Finally, on Y September 1963, she saw

him swimsing alone ln the ocean and promptly went into the vater,

introduced herself, and requested ramission to talk to him.

ANTHUG] granted this permission, and during theli conversation

ArTHual nade it clear he rould

not grant Hrs. AMLEQ-3 permissiOn

to depart Cuba at this time, stating that the

tine was not

propitious due to the attacks and raids being carried out

against Cuba, and that Mrs. AHLED-3 would just have to wait.

Mrs. AHLEQ-3 then told hin she did not see why he was holding her

and her children responsible for what her husband did; that

she

feared her husband might forget her and their, children completely.

If the separation continued,

and that 11 AlltQ3 vas left much

longer alone he would find a woman to replace her.

ANTHUS-1.,

roplied by asking her "Do you consider yourself a

husband?". The wife replied "It is

possible", and AiNTlUG-1 then

asked "But he calls you every day."

Lator during the conversation AltHUG-1 asked

Hrs. AMLFO-3 if ber husband still had the presentation Soviet

pistol that he had given him in 1961, and Mrs. AHLEO-3

Informed his that her husband had taken 11 with him when he

defected and asked ANTHUG-1 1f he vanted lt returned to him.

AMTaUG-1 did not reply to the question.

Later on,

discussing her conversation with AMTHUG-l with Identity B,

Identity B

suggested to ars. Anuios that she request MXLZO-3

to send the pistol back to AuTHUG-1 via Ambassador LECHUGA

at the United Fations, NYC.

Identity B added that the return

of the pistol night help matters

aince the long of the pistol had

been one of the things that bothered AuTHUG. nost when

AMLEO-3 defected.

(1.8. AHLEO3 has noted that these special

presentation Soviet pistols were given by AltHuG-l to probably

less than ten people in Cuba, and their presentation had a very

special meaning for ANTHUG-l since the recipients vere supposed

to be his very personal and close friends.

AMLEO-3 clains

that not even AlLOUT-l had received one of these special

presentation pistols fron AHTHUG-1.) Consideration is being

given to ANTiUG-l's request, 1f 1t would assist firs. AltEO-3

In her afforts to leave Cubs, but for the time being the pistol.

w111 be held by KUBARK:

AMruUG-1 also told Mrs. AMLEQ-3 that her husband had

stolen & light plane when he fled and Implied (although she

does not so state directly) that he would Ilke to see it

returned.

The balance of Mrs. AlLiO3's letter concerned her

desire to leave Cuba, mentioned the necessity for alaness by both

she and her husband with no rash actions, and without giving

any additional facts stated that her conversation with ANTHUG-1

had been a long one but that she could not get him to sake

any promises re her departure.

DEVELOPMENT OF OPERATIONAL LEADS TO DISAFFECTED CUBANS

9..

During the operational period one of AHLED-3's

operational leads, whon he had written a report on for the

AMTRUNK. PM. operation', was recruited via the recently successful

ANTRUNK infIltration operation and given the crypt of AuTRUNk-10

AMLEO3 also screenod additional ANTRUNK leads and KUTUBE

military leads during the period and was able to submit

reports on some four individuals for these operations. ' All such

leads vers led to him mixed In with many other Cuban names.

AMLiO-3 is presently preparing reports on Phs target studios

Major Felipe GUERRA Matos and Hajor Jorge SEGUERA, Cuban

Ambassador to Algeria.

10. AUTEO-3 also assisted is the handling of AllLEO-5'g

wife during the period shen she established direct telephonic

conmunication with her husband io Cuba, and tried to cónvince

him that she wanted to return to Cuba with her children,

but stipulated to A-s that he would have to meet her in a third

country first and resolve their personal fanily problems.

AlLaOs baby sat for the wife during these calls, since we

only knew what day tas calls would be coming in and never the

bour.. He also assisted Hrs. AMLED-j 1n recording the last telephone

conversation she had with her husband.

In this same operation

AMLEO-3 also assisted the Case Officer in the conversations

held with the nother of Allias while she was in the United

States, although he was never allowed to establish direct

contact with the nother.

We had hoped that the mother of

AMLED-S would attempt to establish contact on her own with

AMLEO-3, but to WAVE Station Knowledge she never attempted to do

If

she had, we would have allowed AMLEQ3 to respond to har

contact effortg

1963 Baul PRIMELLES (201-327902) arrived at Identity B's

hono for a visit uhile Mrs. AMLED-3 vas present.

PRIMELLES. Ignored the presence of Hrs. A-3 and did not speak

to herowhile greeting Identity B.

Because of this Identity B

promptly turned her back on her visitors and did not answer

them, continuing her conversation with Hrs. AMuEQ-3.

ATTITUDE, MORALE, AND PERFORMANCE OF AMLEO-3

13.

During the reporting period AMFQ-3 has consistently

• been cooperative with his C/0 and has maintained a good attitude

towards his work. During the latter part of Agust 1963 AMLBO-3

began to lose his patience with the slow progress in getting

his wife into asylum, and began requesting permission to return

to Cuba hingelf in order to exfiltrate his wife black.

AMLEO-3

became quite demanding in this regard and claimed that XUBARK's

time had rus out,

and since he had vaited patiently for sino

months he now felt lt was his turn to try his luck.

AdLEO- 3

in extremaly confident of his own ability in action situations

and operations and extenaiva argumentation vas needed to

persuade him that such a course of action rould ba suicidal

for his wife and children and that h1s laest courso of action

would be to give us additional tine to bring the asylum operation

to a successiul conclusion.

Because of AMBO 3's faith in

higher authority, COS JAWAVE, Andrew I. REUTEMAN visited AHLEO-3

on 8 Septeuber 1963 for the purpose of convincing hiu that any

unilateral action on his part would only be counterproductive

and playing right into ANTHUG-l's hands.

comitments to AblLED-3 vere also reviewed along with the history

of our actlous to help his wife and children leave Cuba legally.

After some frank exchanges of facts AHLEO-3 was finally

that the only productive course of action left to hin was to

continue to sweat out the asylum proposition and hope for the

best.

Absolutely no further commitnents vere made to AbLEQ-3

during these discussions and alternate courses of action 11

the asylus attempts fall were sot discussed but instead left in

abeyance.

OPERATIONAL SUPPORT AND PLANNING

14.

As previously mentioned in paragraph 13 of reference A,

AMLEO 3 went to ZRMITAL during the period 26-30 July 1963 for

the purpose of obtaining a French visa for his allas

documentation.

AULEO-3 successfully obtained the French visa

during this trip, and his allas passport nor contains valid vlazz

for travel to Spain and isance.

(Chester D. DAINOLD. Ia conversations With AlLEO-3 1a ZRUSTAL.

In regard to points a and b in paragraph 2 of reference C,

the KURIOT representative In WAVE Station states that the

drivers license for actual use by the subject and the address

preferred. (The Wall Street Journal invariably prints the word

as "Instalment" with one "]".) It would be appreciated it

Headquarters would in the future coordinate with KURIOT In

Headquarterg on questions which deal with AQUATIC matters prior to

querying WAVE.

COSTS

AMLEO-3 continues to receive a flat salary of five

hundred dollars ($500.00)

per month,

and also is paid approximately

one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month for purchase of foodstuffs

since he is encouraged to eat his meals in the KUBARA

safehouse and stay out of public places.

we have also continued

to pay the wife of AlliO-s the amount of one hundred and twenty five

dollars ($125.00) per month for subsistance för herself and her

two children to supplement the $120.00 per nonth she recelves

from, the Cuban Refugee Center.

The C/O has continued his efforts

to find part-tine employment for HrS. AHEQ5 so that KUBARK

could be relieved of the necessity to support her,

but to date

we have been unsuccessful in our efforts primarily because Mrs.

AHLEQ-5 has never worked in her llfe and has no work skills

whatsoever.

No other financial expenditures of note were made

during the period, and no financial assistance is presently

contemplated for any other AMLECS.

INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTION

17. During the reporting period no positive intelligence

reports were dissemlaated by

the AMLEO grOup since none of

the

active agents are located in the target area, nor do they

circulate in Cuban exile circles.

We are continuing

to utilize AMLEO-3 as & consultant

on the MAPRON progran, and to this end are planniag to have

hin expand his reporting of personality information on selected

individuala and to utilize him to saplala interconnections

between various individuals and groups as they take abape ir
