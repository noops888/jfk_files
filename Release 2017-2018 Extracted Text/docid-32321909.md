Title: John F. Kennedy Records Collection Act

of 1992 (the Act)

Synopsis:

The Act established the Assassination Records Review

(ARRB) to oversee

the governments' production and

compliance with the Act.

The ARRB reviews the proposed

postponements in documents sent by each agency to the National

Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and decides what

postponements the Act allows or opens the document in full.

The

ARRB's responsibilities include having agencies search other

subjects and areas to find any additional material not already

identified as assassination records.

The establishment of the

ARRB by the Act also limited the time for their duties to be

accomplished.

The ARRB must complete their tasks by September

1997.

With this deadline in mind, the ARRB sent a letter

requesting additional information.

Enclosures: ARRB letter requesting material.

Details:

On March 10, 1997, the ARRB sent a letter to the FBI

setting forth a formal request to receive and review additional

records.

The ARRB's goal is to research every possible subject

that may have a bearing on assassination theories and to assure

Congress and the American public that all was done to accomplish

the intentions of the Act.

Requested offices should conduct a search for the

listed items. If Offices are aware of any administrative records

they may have maintained outside the normal index system, they

should include, those areas in the search.

If any documents

related to the matters are found, please forward the documents to

the JFK Task Force..
