III

THOMaS G. FORSyTH,

as follows:

He and 20 other business and professional men, all residents

of New Kensington, Pa., have formed a group known as the

"Volunteers for Good Government," with the purpose

of defeating New Kensington Mayor RAYMOND GARDLOCK and

his associates in the forthcoming primary elections.

He said on April 7, 1961, they issued a twelve point

program for press publication in New Kensington, showing

changes and innovations in local government for the benefit

of the public.

The third point in the twelve point

program states that. "The police departments, ----, and

other government agencies will be returned to their

rightful position of efficiency, dignity, and self-respect

so that they might honestly do the job for which they

were created." The last of the twelve points sets out

that "With the help of the people, we shall remove the

brand. of a racket run city. Curbing of vice will be

placed in the hands of elected officials whose every

desire is honesty,

morality and proper government, not

government by

submission to others.

Naturally, in view of the above-stated proposals, the Volunteers

for Good Government, are receiving opposition from the

racketeering element in New Kensington, dominated by the

MANNARINOS and according to rumor, the incumbents are

receiving considerable sums from the racketeers as campaign

funds.

will be alert for any info of pertinence to the

FBI and will cooperate in any manner possible, especially.

If his group is successful in its efforts to unseat the

current New Kensington political machine.

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
