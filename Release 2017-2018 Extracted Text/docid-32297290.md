BRUNO 1s next in conversation with PH 540-C. This

informant had contacted BRUNO at the request of friends who

were in the cigarette vending business and wanted to ask BRUNO

not to take their customers away. BRUNO was not receptive to

this request. He told this informant that the same people had

sent WILLIE WEISBERG down to ask him to leave their customers

alone. Informant explained to BRUNO that he was attempting to

start

a business venture which would be to sell insurance

policies in coin-operated machines that would cover land travel.

The insurance policies are similar to those dispensed at air-

ports except they cover land travel. Informant mentioned that

the machines could go anywhere such

terminals, etc., and that he would like to put one of the machines

in a trucking company.

• no one,

BRUNO tells the informant to go over to

Moon Carrier in Camden, N. J., to see Mr. HENNY, who has the

authority

• to put the machine

in there, and to tell HENNY that

BRUNO had instructed the informant to come over.

BRUNO said

that he could "intercede with Local 107 of the Teamsters" and

was sure he could put the machines any place where Local 107

had connections.

BRUNO told the informant he had connections

with the Teamsters Union in New Jersey and, in fact, he could

send the informant over to New York and he could put the machines

in the Union business terminals.

On

Sunday, 2/11/62, BRUNO held a conversation

with

IGNATTUS DENARO,

aka., and SAM (INU) from Trenton, N. J., in re-

gard to arbitrating a dispute in regards to numbers operation

in the Trenton, N. J. - Bristol, Pa., area.

This conversation,

partly in Italian or in the Sicilian dialect, is set out in 1ts

entirety.

It is pointed out that this information was furnished

to all offices

which have an interest in

airtel 2/23/62. Portions of this airtel, which include the

Ban hit in a a to an aton,

entire conversation with the comments in the Italian translation,

are included herewith:

BRUNO: All I want: to know is did his wife get

pinched.

Unknown man said no.and that he. would get 100 percent

details and see ANGELO about it.

BRUNO said. it would be all right and he would see

ENYOTS (phonetic) IGNATIUS DENARO.

On 2/15/62 ANGELO BRUNO again meets with PH 540-C

and with EDWARD WALKER, Official, Local 107, Teamsters Union,

Philadelphia. This conversation is in regards to the informant

placing machines that dispense insurance.

The company handling

the machines was identified as Land: Travel Life Insurance.,

BRUNO said thatrhe was going away and when he returns

he would get WALKER and the informant together so that they

could get better acquainted.

BRUNQ is explaining to the informant

that the Teamster officials work together. It was not clear but

it was indicated that the union officials in Local

not

further

identified, want to "make a note out of it."

•"5, „Mate a

note out of it" is a Philadelphia expression for accepting graft.

It is believed WALKER is explaining to the informant that if the

insurance machines were placed in certain locals, individuals

would want a kickback. BRUNO said "you" (the informant) under-

stand, like in New York there is somebody you will have to take

care

of.. Over here you take care of EDDIE.

BRUNO again told the informant when he returned from

Miami he would take him to HENNY who managed the Moon Carriers

In Camden, N. J., so that JOE could arrange to place a machine

at the Moon

Carrier terminal for a test pattern. The informant

left and BRUNO had a conversation with WALKER.

He told. him that

HENNY had been telling BRUNO what was going on, that WEAVER, a .

union official in Camden, had the cigar factory workers lined

up and could get a charter with the AFL-CIO, and that there were

about 600 members involved.

BRUNO said he did not think that

these 600 workers should be pulled away. and placed in the AHL-CIO

because "you are going to need those cigar workers for votes."

BRUNo said he had been telling HENNY to lay off, to wait, ano

wanted to know. 1f WALKER understood. WALKER mentioned the last

time that he was to see

BRUNO and a JIMMIE was apparently involved.

In the late afternoon 3/2/62, BRUNO talked to JOI

NILSON, who has been identified by PH 614-C (TE) as a book-

keeper or an attorney used by BRUNO. It appears that WILSON

is explaining to BRUNQ a shakeup of

Internal Revenue (IRS) office in Camden, N.J. WILSON

possibly had been

talking to DYKE (phonetic) in regard to

this switch of personnel.

BRUNO was told,

you were asking me about one day is over in Camden right

now, BILL CULLEN." WILSON said that he

Job' In Camden, he's the boss in camden,, had "the Director's

WILSON said,

It could be worse, let's put it that way."

WILSON said,

"a lot of people know him, we have done a few

favors for him,

'I'm glad he is there."

BRUNO said, "Well, I'll tell you,

he used. to be all right. I don't know how he is now.

WILSON indicated that CULLEN in the last few years

had become conscientious and was doing everything by the book,

that he had hurt a few people that WILSON did not think should

have been hurt.

WILSON suggested he did not know whether these

people that had been hurt had been hurt intentionally or because

CULLEN did not have control.

the Director of the Camden Office; the Newark Office had had

an Assistant Director, KENNETH BROOK or BOOK (phonetic) who

was previously assistant for JOE MAHER, who is now in Phila-

delphia.

BROOK took MC GINNIS' job when MC GINNIS retired.

CULLEN went to camden to replace GROSs.

GROSSSwent to Newark

to replace KENNETH BROOK oF BOOK, the Acting Director, and

BROOK or BOOK came to Philadelphia as Director. WILSON Said

the

worse guy in the above three was GROSS who was described

as "positively impossible."

BRUNO wanted to know about BROOK and WILSON said

from previous association BROOK had been fair. WILSON said,

"We had a nice relationship with him and our other way is

to talk to BILL GREEN to find out what part GREEN played

to get him the job."

It appears that WILSON may be suggesting that

Congressman WILLIAM GREEN, Philadelphia, would have to be

contacted to ascertain what part the Congressman played in

obtaining BROOK or BOOK his

assignment as Director (IRS),

Philadelphia.
