Memorandum for the Record

Subject: ARRB Issues/Request

Meeting with ARRB Staff, 5 January 1996

1.

lissue: The Board upheld the deletiontof the

23 Nov. 1963,j at their 3 August

1995 meeting. However,

the Board staff has been notified b

Peter Dale Scott, a conspiracy theorist, that the initials.

were released to NARA in an extract from that document. (the

Mexico City Chrono) .

Marwell and Gunn requested that we do

a voluntary (consent) release of the document: They prefer

not to sent it back to the Board for action.

2. [Request] Were there any audio "bugs" in the Cuban

Embassy and/or Consulate?

3. Goodpasture Interview:

According to Gunn,

Goodpasture says there was a working copy of Oswald's

telephone conversation tape.

She heard it and believes it

might have been taken to Dallas by the FBI. She also wrote

some "protest" letters concerning linking the unidentified

man with Oswald.

{NOTE: Goodpasture's comments ties in with Hoover's

comments, which were later denied, that Dallas FBI agents

listened

to a tape of.

Oswald calls; also Warren Commission

staffer Slawson remembers listening to an Oswald tape.

To

date we have found no evidence in the JFK collection that

such a tape existed.

Also I am not aware of any 'protest"

letters from Goodpasture.

[Request] Marwell ask if there were records that would show

if such

I "working tapes"

were made?

4. Gunn would like to make a joint (CIA/ARRB) visit to

the JFK and LBJ Presidential Libraries in February.
