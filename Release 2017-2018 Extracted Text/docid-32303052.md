GABRIEL MANNARINO, aka

ANTI-RACKETEERING

Re your letter 1-25-60, and your airtel 3-1-60, concerning proposed

misur coverage of subject's cottage.

The Bureau is in agreement with the conclusion previously stated in

your letter dated 1-25-60, that use of twisted-pair telephone drop wire by

local telephone company precludes use of Bureau's disguised four-conductor

parallel type drop wire on proposed misur instaliation. Appearance of parallel

type drop wire in an area where twisted-pair drop wire is used exclusively

would arouse curiosity of telephone company employees and possibly would also

be noticed by subject.

Its use would present a definite security hazard to the

misur installation.

The Laboratory has on previous occasions attempted to have disguised

four-conductor twisted-pair type drop wire manufactured for use under

conditions such as encountered in this case. It has not been possible to obtain

this type wire because of production difficulties encountered in attempting to

conceal an extra wire within the thin insulation of the twisted-pair type tele-

phone drop wire.

The misur installation proposed in your airtel dated 3-1-60, is not

approved since no suitably disguised drop wire is available for microphone

egress from the cottage.

& NOTE: Pursuant to Bureau authority, Pittsburgh completed a survey, of subject's

cottage with recommendation that radio-microphone type equipment be installed.

The Laboratory recommended against this type equipment because equipment not

suited for long term installation. Use of the various Microphone-Telephone type

installations suggested by Pittsburgh have been ruled out because they involve

telephone taps. As an alternative to these methods, Pittsburgh suggested use of

disguised four-conductor telephoné drop

wire? The Laboratory has suitably

disguised four-conductor, drop wire of parallel type similar to that in use through-

HeR First, &/10/60erP t/sbu88h artel, 2/4/60, Bualrtel, 2/1/60,

In regard to obtaining the desired misur coverage of the subject's

cottage, the following proposal is submitted for

the Bureau's

consideration.

This proposal is based on two assumptions:

1. That the subject will request telephone service

within the next few months.

pretext inquiry but it is not deemed discreet to do so at this

time.

Therefore, if this proposal is approved, it will be

understood that it is possible that the necessary preparations

might be wasted if the subject does not request telephone service.

On the other hand, iI preparations are delayed until telephone

service is requested, it may well be that no opportunity will

present

itself to make the interior portion of the installation.

2. That it will be possible to discreetly install an

appropriate disguised four-conductor drop line from the road to

subject's cottage. There are two alternatives.

The first alternative would be to attempt to use available parallel

type disguised line.

The Kittanning Telephone Co., which would

serve the cottage, does not use this type of line.

Instead, they

use a twisted-pair type of line in all instances where the Bell

Telephone Co.:

would use parallel type.

If an exception was made

in this case, it would undoubtedly make Kittanning linemen curious.

It is believed that a suitable pretext could be given them by our

contact with the Engineering Department of the company, however.

It is doubtful that

• the subject would notice the exception but this

possibility of course exists. Another, and perhaps a more serious

consideration, is the fact that it might prove impossible to

disguise the pole-end termination of the extra pair so that

it would not be obvious to a telephone lineman.

The second and preferable alternative would be for the Laboratory

to obtain or have made approximately 275 yards of disguised four

conductor twisted-pair drop line.

A sample of the type normally

used by the Kittanning Telephone Co., is being forwarded to the

Laboratory under separate cover.

They buy this wire from the

Whitney-Blake Co., but also occasionally get a similar type from

Graybar. If such

disguised wire can be furnished then a more

discreet installation could be made.

There would be no possibility

is felt that, if necessary, the disguised twisted pair could be .

made slightly larger without being noticed.

Because of the

relatively long distance over which such a disguised drop line will

have to be carried, care would be necessary to assure that the

wires were large enought of offer low electrical resistance and

strong enought to support themselves.

It has been learned that a total

of three support poles will be used between the road and the cottage

(a distance of about 225 yards).

In this proposal, it is assumed

that the Laboratory will be able

to obtain the desired disguised twisted-pair line.

It is proposed that, as soon as adquate security can be obtained,

this office install

3 Mouse units in the manner and locations

illustrated on Figure 5 of Pittsburgh letter dated 1/25/60.

With

the exception of the Sigma relay, limiting resistors and subject's

telephone line, the leads to these Mouse units would be connected

as illustrated

on the sketch attached to Pittsburgh airtel dated

2/4/60.

The leads for the Mouse units would, of course, eventually

be connected to the extra pair in the proposed drop line.

Once the above portion of the installation is completed, it will be

necessary to wait until the subject requests telephone service.

When he does so, arrangements will be made to install the disguised

drop line from pole 29 (see figure 6 of Pittsburgh letter dated

1/25/60), to

the cottage. It will be hoped that the Mouse units

be connected to the extra pair at the same time the subject's i

instrument is installed.

Once these portions are completed, steps would be taken to obtain a

• leased line extending from pole 29 to the central plant in the

Pittsburgh Office.

By reversing the Mouse power supply polarity it should be

possibleto obtain selective coverage with the subject's cottage.

Costs of the leased line were discussed in Pittsburgh letter

dated 1/25/60.

If it is possible to obtain the desired disguised wire and this

proposal is approved, it is requested that the Laboratory

forward two additional Mouse pre-amp units and one additional

power

supply.
