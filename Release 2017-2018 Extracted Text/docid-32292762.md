KLANE has apparently made somectype of deal

SAD HOELLEN, to the effect that he woul

conduct a full investigation

into the FIO RIlO affair.

Those present decided that GIPOLAMI, the Cierk

'of the Probate Court, D'ARCO and Alderman VITO MARZULLO

determine from Mayor DALEY

why this investigation

further decided during the late? afternoon hours of April 26

that GIRGLAMI and FIO RITO would meet with KEANE in his

offices for the purpose of determining why KEANE has decided

to push this investigation.

Following the departure of GIROLAMI and FIO RITO,

in his discussion with MARCY, D'ARCO stated that he was

apprehensive regarding FIO RITO's stand in this matter and

is afraid that FIO RITO does not desire to stand up and

fight this situation. According to D'ARCO, FIO RITO is

extremely apprehensive over the possibility of his obtaining

a jail sentence in this matter and is further apprehensive

regarding the possibility of his, FIO RITO's, wife having

to appear before a hearing board

of some type in this matter.

MARCY advised D'ARCO that he does not want to let

this matter drop and desires that FIO RITO make a determined

stand in this matter and fight the investigation being

conducted by the City Council. MARCY advised that he does

not want to "lose face" in this situation and cannot afford

to make another mistake in the matter.

MARCY further stated that he learned that SAM

GIANCANA has as yet made no statements regarding his opinions

regarding the present

situation.

Mayor DALEY advised FIO RITO that he had two alternatives.

He told FIO RITO that FIO RITO could get up on the floor

the City Council and take an oath that he had properly and

legitimately met all residence requirements. DALEY specified,

however, that in the event FIO

RITO did this, he would also

have to

testify in a civil suit which would undoubtedly be

brought by Republican Alderman JOHN HOELLEN, who has introduced

a resolution that FIO RITO's residence be investigated

that not only FIO RITO but also his wife would be required to

testify in such action under pain of perjury.

DALEY advised

FIO RITO at the meeting of April 29 that if FIO RITO felt

that his position was strong enough so that he would commit

himself and his wife to such action, he, Mayor DALEY, would

then back FIO RITO. However, if he refused to take an oath

as to his residence, then Mayor DALEY suggested to FIO RITO

that the other alternative would be to resign.

CG 6498-PC advised that he spent most of the morning

with FIO RITO on 4/30/63. FIO RITO advised him that he

had recently returned from Florida, where his wife and children

are now residing, and discussed the propoals of Mayor DALEY

with his wife.

FIO RITO strongly indicated to the PCI

that he would not desire to put himself or his wife in the

position of taking oath and testifying as to his residence.

PCI advised that he feels that FIO RITO will resign in the

very near future.

Based on the above information, contacts were made

this date at the lst Ward Organization, at FIO RITO's law

office, and at the Conrad Hilton Hotel, where he is residing

in attempts to contact him.

These attempts were negative,

and messages were left for

SA RUTLAND.

Within ten minutes following these calls,

CG 6498-PC contacted SA ROEMER and advised that he had just

been contacted, and informed that the FBI was attempting to

contact FIO RITO.
