*On 11/24/66, Miami sources knowledgeable in

Cuban exiTe matters, namely MM 492-S, MM 635-S, MM 639-S.34(M)

and CARLOS ZARRAGA MARTINEZ, Key Source - Cuba, were

contacted by SA ROBERT J. DWYER and they advised that no

recent information had come to their attention that JURE

was actively engaged in a plan for the assassination of

FIDEL CASTRO.

..On 12/9/66, OSORIO DAVILA; leading JURE officer

at Miami, Florida,

advised

that until recently the Directorate

Of JURE consisted, of MANUEL RAY in Puerto Rico, ORLANDO;CASTRO

in Venezuela, and DAVILA in Miami.

In order to form a quorum'.

for JURE decisions on a convenient basis, two additional

members have beenaded to the Directorate in Puerto Rico. Y

These are

ARTURO VILLAR and

EMILIO GUEDES.

Mr. DAVILA advised that JURE at Miami is relatively

inactive and he, himself, has obtained employment as a new.

car salesman at Dumas Milner Chevrolet in Miami.

He stated

' that JURE has always maintained the position that CASTRO's

overthrow must be accomplished from inside Cuba and for this

reason MANUEL RAY, leader of JURE,

have continued to seek contacts within Cuba which at some

future time could furnish an opportunity to take action

against the CASTRO regime.

He stated that JURE continues
