NOTE CONTINUED :

A warrant for Rodriguez's arrest is outstanding at

Bergen County, New Jersey, charging him with fraud. However,

when contacted, Bergen County indicated that although they had

a warrant for Rodriguez, they would not request his informal

deportation or extradition from Panama inasmuch as the principal

witness against Rodriguez is uncooperative.

On 12/9/74 Panamanian authorities indicated that

they are considering deporting Rodriguez from the country and

would put him on the plane for Miami in the near future.

SA WIllis Walton, Miami Office, was orally advised

by SA. V. H. Nasca on 12/48/74 to alert INS, Miami•
