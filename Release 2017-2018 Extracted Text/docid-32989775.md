RE:

WILLIAM MARCUS RAY,

also known as

Mark Savage

WILLIAM MARCUS RAY, also known as MARK SAVAGE,

is presently in the st. Louis county Jail pending court

action on a first degree mürder charge. RAY is originally

from Montgomery, Alabama, and was considered a suspect

inasmuch as he did resemble the photograph of one of the

Unknown Subjects in the PIPER kidnaping. Investigation

at superior, Wisconsin, reflected that one MARK SAVAGE,

who was believed to be identical with RAY, was alleged

to have attempted to purchase a mobile home, at which time

he reportedly showed large sums of money.

THOMPSON stated that during the period of time from

March, 1971, to July, 1972, he had worked almost exclusively

in that area of the store selling handcuffs. He stated that

the photograph of ROBERT ALLEN THOMPSON bears some resemblance

to an individual who used to patronize the store. 'He could

not recall any specific handcuff sales. He thought, however.

that it is possible that a BRUCE LONDON, 12 Howard Gnesen,

Duluth, Minnesota, a customer of the store who has purchased

firearms, may have purchased a set of handcuffs.

GALE RACHUY

1 5-9 No. 22nd Avenue west, buluth, Minnesota advised

he was in the St.Louis County Jail at the same time that William Marcus

was in this institution. He stated he talked to RAY several times

and RAY furnished him information that lead him to believe he may be

involved in the Piper kidnapping. RACHUY stated he cannot recall in

detail everything that Ray told him but did recall that Ray remarked that

three men were in on the hidnapping. The three were

BERGERUD whom Ray

+, was subsequently charged and sentenced, and a another man who had been

in St.Coud reformatory or in Stillwater Strte Penitentiary. BERGERUD

was not going to be cut in on the ramsom and he told RaY that he was goir

to go. to thePolice and that is the reason Ray killed him. Rachuy stated

when Ray heard that Bergerud was going to the Police, he grabbed him by

the tie

and hurled him against the wall and left. Bergerud apparently was

knocked unconscious and died when he was unable to catch his breath.

RACHUY also stated that Ray had told him that all three of the men in

volved had taken turns. staying in the woods with Mrs. Piper. Also that

while Mrs. Piper was in the woods bhe cried a lot and requested to be

allowed to return home to her husband. The money from the kidnapping

or at least Ray's share was put in a foreign bank. The actual kidnarping

asRachuy recalled was that the kidnappers called telephonically to Mhe

PIPER residence and requested her to come outside. When she came outside

they kidnapped her. Turing the time Mrs. PIPER was held in the woods in

Fond du lac the two men who were not with her had stayed in a house

nearby and had observed the area for security.

RNCHUY was shown amxuxmx the artist's conception photographs of

the Unknown Subjects in the Piper case and he could not identify any as

anyone he knew. "In this connection he was also shown a photograph of

NW 55W111 DemidiazeuRayParedome also did not recognize him •

brother. SAVAGE has inquired as to BONNIE JOHNSON's whereabouts

and has assumed that BONNIE has left the Duluth area; however,

she is staying at an aunt:'s home in West Duluth, Minnesota.

as follows:

RAY advised that he would willingly discuss his

activities involving the theft of a 1972 Cougar in Montgomery,

Alabama, In May, 1972, subsequently taking it to Asheville,

North Carolina,

and his activities since July 3, 1972, when

he left Asheville, suddenly abandoning the Cougar at the

home of JUDITH MORGAN. He signed a Waiver of Rights form.

He said he used the name WILLIAM GORDON THAMES,

the name of the real owner of the Cougar, during his entire

stay in North Carolina.

He said he flew from Asheville to

Washington, D. C. via

Piedmont Airlines and transferred to

American Airlines in Washington, and continued on to New

York City where he landed at Lagurdia Field. He believed

the ticket cost him about $77.

He checked into the Americana

Hotel in New York on July 3, 1972.

On July 4, 1972, he flew to Detroit, Michigan, via

American Airlines, paying about $66 in cash for the ticket?

Hotel Ponchartrain for about three days.

He said he believed he used the name MARK SAVAGE during

these travels.

He next flew from Detroit to Chicago, had

a layover of about five hours, and then took a North Central

Airlines flight to Duluth, Minnesota.

He bought the ticket

from the American Airlines counter in Detroit.

When he

-arrived in Duluth on About July 6 or July 7, 1972, he checked

into the Hotel Duluth, and stayed about seven days. He then

checked into the Seaway Hotel in Duluth, which had much

more reasonable rates.

He said he met BONNIE JOHNSON of Duluth, along

with her brother, GARY JOHNSON and GARY's wife, DONNA, on

July 8,

1972, at Beaner's Bar in Superior, Wisconsin.

He

RAY said he would call BONNIE or she would call

him at the Seaway Motel on almost a daily basis during the

latter part of July, 1972, and early part of August, 1972.

He said he had nothing to do with the PIPER kidnapping case

and knew very little about it.

He recalled that on July 28

or July 29, 1972, he, BONNIE

and GARY and DONNA JOHNSON went

to the Tri-State Fair in Superior: Wisconsin, and Sunday,

July 30 superiothe four of them went on a picnic to Patterson

He said if he were involved in the kid-

napping where a million dollars was taken, he certainly

would not be sticking around Duluth.

RAY said he estimated he spent between $8,000 to

$9,000 in cash from the time he came to Duluth until he

was arrested by the Duluth Police Department on September

24, 1972, at which time he had less then $1 in his pocket.

about the source of this

money, RAY stated he

had some money with him when he arrived in Duluth, and had

been given approximately $10,500 in cash during the time he

spent in Duluth.

He explained that about four years ago

• he tipped off a. businessman in Alabama

on a scheme where

the businessman made $486,000. He claims that what he, RAY,

did was not illegal, that he was present in a

either in Birmingham

or Montgomery, Alabama, when $486,000

in cash was delivered to this businessman.

RAY refused to

disclose this man's name or the nature of his dealings.

RAY said the $10,500 he received was from this

man in acknowledgement of the favor RAY had done for him.

RAY claims that on July 20, 1972, he flew from

Duluth to Chicago via North Central Airlines in an early

morning flight, rented a Ford car from Hertz, and drove to

Rockford, Illinois, where he met a man by prearrangement at

the Best

Western Motel, which is the first one

on the right

after coming off the interstate. He said he had lunch with

this man who gave him $1, 400 or $1,500 in cash, and he then

drove back to Chicago and

flew back to Duluth that evening.

This money he said was in partial payment for the services

he had rendered the Alabama man four years ago.

RAY said that on another occasion he received

either a registered or certified letter containing $4,000

in cash all in $100 bills.

This was received in Duluth,

and he was also delivered

by another man, $5,000 in cash.

RAY said he made two trips to Minneapolis during

the time he spent in Duluth. The first one was along with

BONNIE JOHNSON and they flew to Minneapolis on about August

22, 1972, stayed several days at the Radisson Hotel, and re-

turned to Duluth with BONNIE's parents, Mr. and Mrs. WARD

JOHNSON, who had driven to Minneapolis to get them.

On the weekend of September 8-10, 1972, RAY said

BONNIE, GARY, and DONNA JOHNSON, and he drove to

Minneapolis

in GARY's car, that they rented a suite, Room Suite 316 and

318, and that he paid approximately $148 for the rooms.

When asked about the safe deposit box key #34,

which he had

given to BONNIE JOHNSON to hold for him, RAY,

after a long

hesitation, said this key belonged to him,

that it was a safe deposit box key, and that he did not

care to discuss it.

He refused to disclose the name of

the bank, but subsequently said he had rented the box in

June, 1972, while he was in North Carolina,

and

that he

used the name SHAL ERIC RIVERS in renting the box.

At that time, he said he has also used the name SHAL ERIC •

BRANDON.

At the conclusion of the interview, RAY reaffirmed

his innocence in the PIPER case, said he had admitted his

interstate transportation of a stolen car, but that he knew

nothing whatsoever of the PIPER case.

PINAP

On the night of 10-16-72 RICHAR, LAGODA, Detective Bureau, Duluth,

Minnesota Police Department advised that he had arrested MELVIN D.

PEERSON of Duluth, Minnesota, age 23 on a charge of Contempt of

Court. He stated PEDERSON is on Federal Parole for car theft and his

parole officer is MELVIN SMITH, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Yagoda stated

PEDERSON lives at 9428 Grand Avenue, Duluth, minn., and that he was

born 1-25-49 at Alexandera, Minnesota. YAGODA stated PEDERSON rem

arked to him that he had some information to offer concerning the

PINAP case.

On 10-17-72 MELVIN PEDERSON was interviewed at the St. LouisCounty

Jall/in Duluth Minn. he stated he is the brother in law of

KENNETH

KRONBERG who was killed in the Arturos Tavern in Minneapolis,Minn.

In July, 1972. PEDERSON was in Minneapolis at the time and was out

side the tavern when KRONBERG was shot. He explained KRONBERG

married his sister DONA. PEDERSON stated KRONBERG was killed by

JOE BOGWEBER. He did /not know specifically what the killing

about but from what he understood BALLWEBER killed KRONBERG 'becasue

a sum of money was owed by BALLWEBER to KRONBERG. PEDERSON believed

this involved the PINAP case because early in 1972 and as late as

in May, 1972 KRONBERG used to make numerous visits to Duluth, Minn.

During these times KRONBERG would get high on drugs and when

he was

•under the influence of drugs, he would get very talkative. On one oi

chese occasions, KhUnbure told him that a "big score" was planned a

if it turned out right, he KRONBERG would no longer have to resort

to "boosting" for a living. PEDERSON stated that KRONBERG belonged

to a gang that went throughout the country shoplifting diamonds:

fur coats and anything else they could lay a hand on.

PERSON Stated get the years KRONBERG and his gang (whom Pederson

would not identify) have stolen thousands of dollars in merchandise

which PEDERSON stated would be fenced principally to FREMiANga big

fense in Minneapolis,Minn. He stated FREEMAN owns or operates a

stores, and is very wealthy. PEDiSON stated he

questioned KRONBERG about the "big score" but KRONBERG would not

elaborate on it.

He stated his sister did live at 4719 NorthShore in Minnatonka

and she still owns this property. However she now lives on a house

with VAN CLIPPER on Penn Avenue North in Minneapolis,Minn. PEDERSON

stated that VAN CLIPPER is in with the boosting group in Minneapolis

Minnesota, more of less on the fringe. However VAN CLIPPER knows abou

their activities. He stated he understood that VAN CLIPPER was to

marry DONNA on 10-17 or 10-18=72.

Approximately two weeks ago PEDERSON was at his sísters home on

Penn Avenue North visiting. In the house at the/time besides his

• sister were KELLY MATISON and a man named "Iubby": He did not know

much about them other than that they were visiting. During the visit

the

PIPER case came up and the general remarks made at the time was

that KRONBERG was mixed up in the kidnapping. and that he had some

money coming as a result of his involvement. They asked PEDERSON if

he knew the identity of "ALABAMA" who was from Duluth and whose

true name was believed to start with "DON"'. The group (no one spec-

ifically) requested that inasmuch as he was from Dulüth hẹ should

attempt to identify "Alabama" as he was supposed to be involved in

the kidnapping with KRONBERG.

¿ PEDERSON stated that he did meet a man named DON who visited with

KRONBERG possibly in May or June, 1972 at the Penny Parking lot in

the Plaza, located in the East end of Duluth. At the time KRONBERG

had come to Duluth and had picked up PEDERsoN and they nad ariven

to the Parking lot. The man "Don" came walking to the lot and KRON-

BERG got out of the car and they stood and talked in front of the

when PEDERSON was shown photographs of Unsubs in the Piper case, he

stated DON resembled him •

PEDERSON stated that he feels sure that the individuals involved in

the PIPER case are from Minneapolis and that the FBI probably have

already talked to them. He stated the group in his sisters house

told him that they wanted to get Alabama bedause they felt he was in

with BALLWEBER and that KRONBERG was killed to prevent him from

obtaining his share in the kidpapping.

PEDERSON stated that whenever KRONBERt came to Duluth he would stay

at the Hotel Duluth, the Holiday inn or the Lagewater dast or wes?

was in Duluth during the first par of July and stayed at this hotel

until 7-4 or 7-5-72 when he returnii to Minneapolis. He did not know

who KRONBERG contacted but stated as he recalled KRONBERG did call

him while he was there. He accompanied KRONBERG back to Minneapolis

and stayed with him until he was killed.

It is pointed out that PEDERSON is aware that the U.S. Probation

office is in the process of revoking his pavole and it is felt that

PEDERSON may be trying to work out some arrangement where his

RE: WILLIAM MARCUS RAY;

CHARLES CAULT

Investigation of the above was predicated

upon receipt of information that RAY claimed he was

involved in the PIPER kidnapping. RAY also stated or

implied that one CHARLES GAULT from somewhere in Alabama

was invoived with him in the kidnapping; that CAUlt

committed suicide in December, 1973.

The following investigation was conducted at

Birmingham, Alabama, by SA COLEMAN D. GIARY, III:

On October 17, 1974, HOYN CAULT, 917 4th Court,

West, after being advised of the identity of the incer

viewing Agent and the purpose of this investigation,

advised that he picked up his son, CHARLES N. CAULT,

from the Federal Prison at Maxwell AFB, Alabama, on 0x

about February 2, 1972, after he was placed" on parole.

He

drove his son to Birmingham where he has been residing

ever since with his wife, Mrs. ELIZABETH CAULT, at 2341

Laurel View Place, Rocky Ridge, Birmingham, Alabama. His

son has worked every day with him in the Auto Salvage and

Parts business. Practically every day they contact the Na-

tional Tire and Salvage Company located at 2900 North

21st Avenue, Birmingham, and usually every day they

contact and sell parts tô Bill Russell Auto Parts, Incor

porated, located at 1423 First Avenue, Bessemer.

His son

is also active in little leage Naseball and football since

his return to Birmingham. in February, 1972. He has not

made any trips outside the State of Alabama to his know

ledge and from the period February, 1972, to February:

1973, he was under the supervision of Federal Probation

Officer E. A. DAVIS at Birmingham.

He said that his son has made trips to Montgomery,

Alabana, but to his knowledge, he has not been outside the

State of Alabama at any time and particularly during the

period July 27-29, 1972.;

/ "'""" His son is, as mentioned above, working hard

and leading an exemplary life with his family and he has

not been involved in any type of criminal activity since

his parole in February, 1972.

After viewing an artist's sketch of the unsubs

in this case, he said that neither of them looked Familiar

to him and both of them were considerably older than his

son.

On October 28, 1974, Mrs, ELIZABEIE GAULT, 2341

Laurel View Place (Rocky Ridge), was advised of the

identity of the Interviewing Agent and the purpose of this

investigation. Sh e stated that her husbana has been

him of being involved in a kidnaping, however, it is en

tirely possible that someone who knew him while he was

in the Federal Prison at Texarkana, may have given

his

name to the authorities.. However, she said that it is

ridiculous to think that her husband had anything to đo

with the kidnaping. As mentioned above, her husband

was not away from home during the latter part of July!

1972, as he was busy with his work and little league

baseball during this particular period of time.

On November 15, 1974, JOHN W. MC INTOSH, Federal

Probation Offices, Birmingham, Alabama, advised from his

records on CHARLES NEWMAN CAULT that GAULI's registered

number was 17723149, and he was released on parole on

February 2, 1972, to return to his home at 2341 laurel

View Place, Birmingham, at Maxwell AFB, Alabama. He

was under supervision for a year from February 2, 1972

until February 2, 1973, at which time he was released

from parole.

During the year that he was on parole, he was

in contact on a monthly basis with Parole Officers

E..A. DAVIS and RUFUS NIX and according to his file, he

contacted the Parole Office on July 31, 1972.

At no time did he travel outside the State of

Alabama during this period of time and his record was

excellent as he worked regularly with his father in the

Auto Salvage business and was still working in this capacity

at the time he was released from parole on February 2, 1973..

There was nothing unfavorable in his file and

ta his knowledge, he did not engage in any type of

ciminal activity while he was on parole.
