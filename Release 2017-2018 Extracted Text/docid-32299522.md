in return for giving MARIORANO the vending machine rights

at the luncheonette.

machines on BRUNO's terms because of past favors performed

by BRUNO for D'ATTILLIO.

that by golfsAPPY" MARGOLIS out of the money he received

PH T-2 advised that GEORCE KATZ believes the

reason ANGELO BRUNO, MAX WEISBERG, SAM MARGOLIS, FELIX

JOHN DE TULLIO, and FRANK PALERMO have had frequent.

meetings in the past is because of their involvement in

SONNY LISTON's contract.

KATZ believes that PALERMO and

MARGOLIS are currently at odds, and that PALERMO had

borrowed a sum of money from FELIX JOHN DE TULLIO with the

intention of repaying it subsequent to the LISTON-CLAY

prize fight.

MARGOLIS, according to KATZ, apparently

borrowed money from the "Jewish Group" with the same

intention of repaying it after the fight. As of March

15, 1964, the earnings of the prize fight were impounded,

hence it was necessary for MARGOLIS and PALERMO to

the proceeds from Coney Island.

Further, the only person

FROMKIN 1s afraid of 1s ANGELO BRUNO, and the only person

to whom he will answer is BRUNO.

GOLOB stated that there are three owners of

Coney Island, namely ANGELO BRUNO, NORMAN FRONKIN, and

BERNARD ALLEN.

According to GOLOB, the Dominican Republic 1s
