NY 105-39412

Concerning the specifie, information relating to

possible atrack on a cuban shie which was received fron

Legat, Ottawa, and contained in rebutel 3/12/00, the NYC

would like to point out that the possibility exists that

the letter circulated by YVANGUARDIA REVOLUCIONARIA

was originally dated February 28, 1968.

This letter wANA"

"EL TIEMPO"

Cuban and Soviet bloc representatives together with a threat

to attack Cuban ships.

It is possible that this letter may

have fallen into the hands of CIS personnel and in turn, was

relayed to the Cuban Ambassador in Ottawa, Canada. It 1s

also possible that the individuals responsible for sending.

this letter, now believed to be JoSE RAMoNGUes and his

associates,

could very well have sent a letter to the Cuban

Mission to

the Un, to the uN or even to one of the Ministries

of the Cuban Government in Havana, Cuba 1042(4)

The NYO will remain constantly alert for the

oossibility that the CIS has Infiltrated the CNM

the MIRR

or other anti-CASTRO revolutionary organizations. The NYC

also contemplates interviewing JOSE RAMON EGUES vigorously

concerning his activities with "VANGUARDIA REVOLUCIONARIA

CUBANA"

During this interview, the NYO will attempt to

determine whether or not EGUES and his group had sent this

letter to any representative of the Cuban Government which

could be the explanation why the Cuban Government was in the

possession of the information indicating that the exiles were

planning to take sone reciprocal action for the ramming of a

lifeboat by the Cuban freighter "JULY 26"

off the coast of

Virginia In February, 1968. JeTAX (4)

The Bureau will be kept advised of all developments

in this matter.
