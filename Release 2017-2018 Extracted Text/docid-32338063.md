(2) what measures can be taken on a longer range basis to cut the frequency

0f, these raide to a bare minimum.

Participants at the conference outlined information they then had

available which showed that currently nine different groups were planning u

forays against Cuba in the immediate future.

Our Miami Office had knowledge

of most of these planned forays and had made dissemination concerning the

groups involved in live of them.

In fact, our Miami Office cortributed

signllicantly to the conterence here, furnishing information developed the?

Memorandum to Mr. Sullivan

Re: ANTI-CASTRO ACTIVITIES IN THE U.S.

SEBREI

IMMEDIATE ACTION RECOMMENDED BY. THE CONFERENCE:

Mr. Cottrell made a point of the fact that this conference was

merely to recommend action which might be instituted by the U.S. Govern-

ment to frustrate plans of the Cuban refugees to conduct raids against

Cuba in the immediate future and to recommend action U.S. Government might

take on a longer range basis in an effort to reduce such raids to a bare

minimum.

He said it was recognized on the highest levels of our Government

that a one hundred percent elimination of these raids would be an

impossibility.

It was made clear by FBI representatives at the conference; who

were supported in this respect by Assistant Attorney General Yeagley, that

FBI has no jurisdiction concerning or responsibility for actions of a

preventive nature.

Mr. Grapp forcefully explained that Bureau has certain

intelligence responsibilities to produce information, which we are doing,

in this matter and that its other responsibilities relate to investigating

activities indicating a possible violation of Federal statutes.

respect to the present raids against Cuba, it was pointed out that if the

Department specifically requests an FBI investigation of an allegation

that a raid is being planned, the investigation is undertaken immediately

and pursued on a special basis for the purpose of developing facts which

can be presented to the Department for its consideration and opinion as

to prosecutive action.

Mr. Cottrell then proceeded to direct discussion toward action

which the conference desired to recommend that the President consider for

the purpose of stopping cold the raids against Cuba which may be imminent.

Participants at the conference other than FBI representatives then

engaged in a lengthy discussion which firmed up the following recommended

actions:

"(1) An understanding with Sir Robert Stapleton, Consul General

of Nassau, which would permit personnel of the U.S. Coast Guard to land

on islands which are British territory for the purpose of checking

suspicious boats. A Coast Guard representative at the conference pointed

out that there is presently an understanding with Sir Robert permitting

Coast Guard overflights of British territory for this purpose.

Cottrell

stated that this action, if approved, would have to be instituted in

Washington.

Mr. Grapp learned following the conference that Cottrell

ordered that no landings by the Coast Guard be effected on British

territory until further notice. (&(S

place departure controls into effect against Cuban parolees. It was
