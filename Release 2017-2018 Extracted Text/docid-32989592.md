ADDENDUM OF THE INSPECTION DIVISION W.M. FELT:wmj 9/14/70

This is a request for temporary telephone surveillance

coverage of the Jewish Defense League (JDL) offices in New York

during the October Commemoration Session of the United Nations.

NUMBER OF FOREIGN COUNTERINTELLIGENCE TARGETS

The Director has already approved(1) temporary surveillances

for the same purpose - all to be terminated on 11/1/70.

The requested JDL coverage could be very important in

view of the paramilitary nature of this group which has threatened

to hijack planes in retaliation against the Arabs. There has been press

speculation that JDL is involved in the London kidnapping of 3 El Fatah

members. I feel this request is logical and recommend approval.

The attached proposed memorandum to the Attorney General

of the request.

The Times article states "at least 491 surreptitious

devices in the homos or offices oi crininal suspects, and that

509 nicrophones had been surreptitiously installed by the

period."

Our neaorandum of Cctober 17, 1975, to the SSC, al

showing 191 entrios from 1960 to 1975 to install microphones in

crimina. Investigations.

Fron 1960 through 1065, there were

394 such entries; from 1966 through 1968, there were none; and

A survey on 5/11/76 by SA H. W. Porter III of material

used in our 10/17/75 memorandum to the SSC showed that 66.99

percent of the targets of microphone installations were in

I note the following paragraph in the New York Times for

today:

The committee staff also reported that the

bureau had made at least 191 surreptitious

entries between 1960 and 1975 to install

listening devices in the homes oi offices

of criminal suspects, and that 509 microphones

had been surreptitiously installed by the

bureau in domestic intelligence cases during

the same period.

Also the following paragraph in the Washington Post:

In addition to the estimate of more than 200

"black bag jobs," the report said the FBI

has installed more than 500 bugs without warrant

since 1960 "against intelligence and internal

security targets," a technique which "the

Justice Department still permits."

These paragraphs give the impression that entries without

a warrant are still being made or are still "permitted"

for internal security targets.

a Negro prostitute named Sue Nicholas (phonetic). They went

to the parking lot adjacent to the night club and while they

were engaged in a pervert act ino acconplices of vicholas

Manuel pointed

out that during the investigation an arrangement yas made

whereby Nicholas would identify her accomplices who would

be given a minimum fine it they confessed.. In return,

nothing would be said about the act of perversion which was

taking place between Nicholas and the Congressman when the.

information in the past on May 27, 1965, advised that Capel

had been in contact with a person named Robert Fowler Concerning

an article to be published in "The Herald of Freedon" fer

taining to Martin Bormann, the former Nazi official in Germany

who disappeared during the closing days of World War II.

He was subsequently convicted as a war criminal and sentenced

to death in absentia. Since 1945, numerous reports and rumors

have been received that Bormann is alive in various parts of

the world; however, none of these reports.has proved to be

true: His present thereabouts is unknown.

In discussing the proposed article Fowler pointed

out that Bormann once lived in the United States and owned

property here. The subject indicated that the Attorney

Generat as weil as the Department of State and the Immigration

and Naturalization Service allowed Bormann to come into the

countri. Fowler advised the subject that it is not known

Frank A. Capell is editor-publisher of the newsletter,

"The Herald of Ireedom," published at Zarephath, New Jersey.

Capell has, in the past, published much information in his

newsletter regarding alleged security risks in various agencies

in the United States Government, particularly the Department of

State.

He,was recently indicted at los Angeles, California,

for criminal libel, based on his charge that Senator Thomas H.

Kuchel had been arrested for homosexual activities.

Capell

subsequently pled nolo contendere to this charge and was fined

$500.

A source who has furnished reliable information in

the past reported contact between Capell and Ike Mcnally,

Iditor of "Counter Attack," on July 27, 1965.

During this

contact, icanally told Capell he would

to a letter pritten to a member of the Communist Party in the

South named Jim Dombrowski (phonetic), supposedly by a high-

ranking member of the previous administration, asking advice

about organizing the Peace Corps.

Capell indicated that former

Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy was the author of this letter,

which supposedly had been secured during a raid. Capell further

indicated that the original of this letter was in a safe of the

Louisiana Un-American Activities Committee, and that Senator

Hastland, the New Orleans Police Department, and possibly the

Honorable Marvin Watson

Special Assistant to the President

The White House

Washington, D. C.

Dear Hr. Watson;

We have learned from a source from whom we have

received reliable information in the past that Dom Frasca,

Sunday City Editor, the "New York Journal American," intends

to write a book about President Johnson.

This information

may be of interest to the President.

Our source advised that Frank A. Capell, Editor of

the anticonmunist publication "The Herald of Freedom," on

September 30, 1965, indicated that Frasca, while associated

with Senator

Barry

Goldwater, had worked for months "digging

stuff up" on President Johnson; that this material had never

been used; and that the data in Frasca's possession included

sworn affidavits and tape recordings. Capell also stated that

Frasca has "five times" the material used in the book entitled

"'A Texan Looks At Lyndon."

Frasca, who previously has been described by officials

of the New York City Police Department as completely unethical,

is the individual who allegedly on February 10, 1964, advised

Billie Sol. Estes that he had the authority to assure Estes

of

a iull

pardon after Senator Barry Goldwater's election as

President if Estes vould reveal his "tie-in" with President

Johnson.

Frasca at the time was employed at Senator Goldwater's

Campaign Headquarters in Washington, D. C.

Estes allegedly advised Frasca that he had tape recordings

containing conversations between President Johnson and Estes

and between Estes and other unnamed, highly placed Government

officials in Washington, D. C., which, if disclosed, might

cause considerable embarrassment to certair unnamed individuals

-in Washington, D. iC.

Reference is made to my letter dated May 6,71965,

pertaining to the subject, who is editor of the newsigther.

"The Herald of Freedom." A source who has furnished reliagle

information in the past on May 27, 1965, advised that Caped

had been in contact with a person named

Robert Fowler Concerning

an article to be published in "The Herald of Freedom" ner

taining to Martin Bormann, the former Nazi official in Germany

who disappeared during the closing days of World War II.

He was

subsequently convicted as a war criminal and sentenced

to death in absentia.

Since 1945, numerous reports and rumors

have been received that Bormann is alive in various parts of

the world; however, none of these reportschas- proved to be

true. His present whereabouts is unknown.

In discussing the proposed article Fowler pointed

out that Bormann once lived in the United States and owned

property here. The subject indicated that the Attorney

General as well as the Department of State and the Immigration

and Naturalization Service allowed Bormann to come into the

country. Fowler advised the subject that it is not known

who pernitted.this to happen since it was "high level monkey

businesse

Reak

The files of this Bureau do not indicate that

Bormannwas ever in the United States or that he owned

property in this

country.
