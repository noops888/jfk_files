Juan ERrUJAGA, iubiece on archant.

soun Hale MUNSOn, born 1905, reildent of Los

Angeles, approached LICOrET/l in 196% claiming he

cepresented a large group of Cuban exiles in the Lo:

Angoles area. MUNSON asked LICOET/1 about the location

of training camps, etc. LICOIT/l repoited the discussion

to station Mexico City and wa; instructed to avoid MUNSON.

Donn Hale MUNSON 1s probably identical with the bonn MUNSON

wilo authored the saga article. There are no additional

identifiable traces on MUNSON.

2. There arc numerous traces on Juan BUIAG: Aizcorbe,

he onner of the weapons plant named in the lage article.

I'he FBI also reported ERruinod was Involved in the sale ot

arme to Cabun revolucionarics in 1965. although RI was Ui

ible to locute the repore, it was classicied to Manolo it's

201 file. This could tend to support the last claim that

any weapons supplied by ENQUIAGA': flen went to the JULE

crowd, not to any igency supported group.

Ile has received no reply.

In response to my request

at the meeting on 13 October 1966 he told me at our subsequent

meeting on 15 October that he attempted to reach his inside

contact by phone but was unsuccessful.

He was urged to

continuo until he reached the party and to obtain as much

detail on this matter as possible so we could hopefully

clarify the situation.

He assurred me he would follow-through

on this and report

AMBADGER. (It seemed protty obvious to

me after two discussions with

on this subject that he has

no direct means of reaching the original reporting source on

Plot" and consequently may never be able to verify

the original "tip" and obtain further details.
