security informants (SEs, Cuban sources, sources of information,

confidential sources

and established sources; release

foreign counterintelligence information.

(U) The staff of the ARRB advised the JFKTF that the

board members have reconsidered their position on the true name

identities of informants

any information when contacted about the assassination of

the JFKTF can verify that the person is still living. The JFKTF

conducts

searches on the identities to provide the Butte

Information Technology Center with as much identifying

information found through research. However, in most cases no

information can be found through name searches at Headquarters

and in the reporting

field office.

Therefore, the evidence that

the JFKTF reports to the ARRB is that there is no information

available or give a date of birth. The ARRB. will not approve

postponements without verification of the individuals living

status.

(U) The ARRB also advised the JFKTF of their tentative

schedule for their meeting dates through November 1996. The

dates

are:

6/4-5/96; 6/25-26/96; 7/9-10/96; 8/5-6/96; 9/16-

17/96; 10/15-16/96; 10/29-30; and 11/13-14/96. These dates

should be noted since the JFKTF will advise NSD and CID of the

ARRB's determinations and seek recommendations from them as soon

as the JFKTF is unofficially notified of their decisions.

(U)

The 60 documents pertaining to the decisions from

the current meeting, which the FBI may wish to appeal, are listed

below by document number with the information to be released.

The current status of informants and sources, if found through

research, is noted after the name with living (L), deceased (D),

Re:

JFK Task Force (U)

ADDENDUM: NATIONAL SECURITY DIVISION (ND), 6/24/96, EMI

on 5/29/96, the Assassination Records Review Board

(ARRB) voted to release information in 60 documents that would

reveal the identities of 114 individuals who were described as

potential criminal informants (PCI), potential security

informants (PSI), security informants (SI), Cuban sources,

sources of information, confidential sources (CS) and established

sources. (U)

NSD has reviewed referenced Electronic Communication .

(EC) and requests

that the JFK Task Force pursue appeal of

documents containing FBI informant identities and symbol numbers,

where indicated, in the documents attached to this EC numbered as

follows:

#1 thru #12

#14 thru #38

#54

NSD continues to maintain that the identity of bonafide

sources/informants should not be released since these individuals

have received expressed promises of confidentiality.

To violate

this promise of confidentiality would serve to undermine the

FBI's ability to obtain vital information from potential future

sources of information and, even more important, jeopardize the

personal safety of informants still living and their respective

families. NSD disagrees with the ARRB position that the

historical aspect of the release of the identity of these

individuals outweighs the potential harm to them.

confidentiality is granted, the FBI is obligated to protect the

identity of bona fide sources/informants absent statements by

them to the contrary. (U)

#13 - NSD recommends the FBI appeal the release of

information concerning certain aspects of the microphone

surveillance of Marina Oswald's residence based on a

recommendation from the Advanced Telephony Unit, Engineering

Research Section of the FBI at Quantico, VA. (8(U)

effect on foreign relations between the United States and Russia,

as well as other countries, should they be confronted with public

confirmation of the U.S. Government's monitoring of Soviet

diplomatic and other telephone conversations: PLS

#40 thru #50 - NSD recommends the FBI appeal the

release of information that would reveal telephone surveillance

of the Soviet Embassy, Washington, D.C. and investigation of

Soviet Officials. As

articulated by the Task Force,

investigative methods and techniques such as telephone

surveillance may vary in application, but do not normally

diminish in importance with time.

Public exposure of the FBI's

specific use of same would cause harm to the FBI's foreign

counterintelligence investigative capabilities. In addition, the

Russian Government would likely complain that technical coverage

of their Embassy or diplomats in the United States constituted a

violation of the Vienna convention. Finally, the United States

is currently allied with Russia, with Russian troops under

United States command in Bosnia; and the FBI is currently

attempting to establish friendly relations with Russian

Government officials to fight terrorism, organized crime, drugs

and other criminal activities.

Revelation of our investigation

of a Soviet official and use of technical surveillance would harm

these developing relationships and could cause the Russian

Government to feel compelled to publicly address these

embarrassing revelations. (X(u)

#51 - NSD recommends the FBI appeal the release of

information which reveals technical surveillance of Hungarian

officials or establishments as such disclosure would compromise

investigative methods and harm U.S. foreign relations with

Hungary raising much the same concerns as are addressed above

#55 & #56 - NSD recommends the FBI appeal the release

of information which reveals technical surveillance of the Polish

Government's newspaper and investigation of Polish officials as

such disclosure would compromise investigative methods and sue

an adverse effect on U.S. foreign relations with Poland.
